<h2 style=""text-align: center;color:#3A265C;letter-spacing:-0.05em;"">HAVE FUN WHILE LEARNING ROBOTICS</h2>
<p>We live in a technology enabled world. In the next 10-15 years there will be rapid advancement in robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning which will transform jobs, our way of life, and the way we interact with technology. To get the new generation of kids ready for what is to come, we are offering VEELER - an Open Source Robot Platform.</p>
<p>VEELER is a robot designed to be a platform which can be reprogrammed, hacked and extended.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535637302/tkp2f9lenwfc9p4fw489.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>MODULAR APPROACH</h3>
<p>The base board is designed in such a way as to add multiple boards layered over it which opens possibilities to add customized board for custom solutions.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535365101/afz1yp0deyoabuwl9drd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>BASE BOARD</h3>
<p>Base board includes multiple sensors and modules required to interact with the robot.</p>
<ul>
<li>Motor Controller: This controls the four metal geared motors attached to VEELER</li>
<li>RGB LED : Twin RGB LED's are used as indicators which can be individually controlled to showcase any one of the rainbow colors</li>
<li>Buzzer : Mute robot makes no sense. We added a buzzer to indicate any actions</li>
<li>Mode Button : Use button control to turn on/off the robot, or switch robot modes or program it for any custom actions</li>
<li>Light Sensor : VEELER knows if it is day or night. The light sensor helps VEELER control RGB LED's intensity considering the ambient light</li>
<li>Infrared Transmitter : Coordinate multiple robots using the infrared transmitter. Get a set of VEELERs and create your own SWARM robots</li>
<li>Infrared Receiver : Included Infrared Remote controller can be used to control the robot. Use it to navigate a path, control LEDs, Buzzer and modes. For SWARM robots, the receiver can be used to receive signals from other robots</li>
</ul>

<h3>CONTROL BOARD</h3>
<p>This is the brain board which controls VEELER. The board has an Atmel AVR Chip which can be programmed in C/C++. The default setup comes with Arduino boot-loader and can be programmed using open source Arduino IDE.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535371743/o32rzk1wu8n5dmfz3m8d.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>BLUETOOTH BOARD</h3>
<p>This is an add-on board which sits on top of controller board. VEELER can be controlled by an Android application via Bluetooth.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535371760/ybywn9wwkxsvcm62ztuy.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>VEELER CHASSIS</h3>
<p>Now keeping in mind that users will be editing, upgrading and basically pounding away on this little robot, strength and tolerance becomes very important factors. Thus we have the all aluminum chassis making it almost unbreakable. Four wheel driven VEELER with all metal gear motors gives it the ability to  maneuver freely and allows it to almost turn on a dime. Drive it over mud, rocks, grass or sand, it just keeps going.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535365285/uoxsewbqjofpegsedwvj.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>OLED</h3>
<p>VEELER has a built-in OLED that can be used to display emotions, text or direction. Open Source library makes sure you can tweak and edit it.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535636695/umiwtja5ld2ltscfmpvo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>POWER SOURCE</h3>
<p>VEELER comes with 7.4v Lithium-ion battery holder with built in Battery Management System (BMS). Just add two 18650 batteries, turn on the switch and the fun begins. Out of juice? We have included a charger so that the fun continuous.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535637302/tkp2f9lenwfc9p4fw489.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>ROBOT MODES</h3>
<p>VEELER can either run on Autonomous mode or manual control.</p>
<p>Autonomous Mode : Turn on Autonomous mode and the robot whizzes through any terrain while avoiding obstacles. The sonar sensor makes sure VEELER does not hit your cat.</p>
<p>Manual Mode : Use your remote controller or the mobile application to control the robot. Change its speed at run-time, LED colors and the buzzer, all while driving on sand, mud or grass.</p>

We live in a technology enabled world. In the next 10-15 years there will be rapid advancement in robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning which will transform jobs, our way of life, and the way we interact with technology. To get the new generation of kids ready for what is to come, we are offering VEELER - an Open Source Robot Platform.
VEELER is a robot designed to be a platform which can be reprogrammed, hacked and extended.

MODULAR APPROACH
The base board is designed in such a way as to add multiple boards layered over it which opens possibilities to add customized board for custom solutions.


BASE BOARD
Base board includes multiple sensors and modules required to interact with the robot.

Motor Controller: This controls the four metal geared motors attached to VEELER
RGB LED : Twin RGB LED's are used as indicators which can be individually controlled to showcase any one of the rainbow colors
Buzzer : Mute robot makes no sense. We added a buzzer to indicate any actions
Mode Button : Use button control to turn on/off the robot, or switch robot modes or program it for any custom actions
Light Sensor : VEELER knows if it is day or night. The light sensor helps VEELER control RGB LED's intensity considering the ambient light
Infrared Transmitter : Coordinate multiple robots using the infrared transmitter. Get a set of VEELERs and create your own SWARM robots
Infrared Receiver : Included Infrared Remote controller can be used to control the robot. Use it to navigate a path, control LEDs, Buzzer and modes. For SWARM robots, the receiver can be used to receive signals from other robots




CONTROL BOARD
This is the brain board which controls VEELER. The board has an Atmel AVR Chip which can be programmed in C/C++. The default setup comes with Arduino boot-loader and can be programmed using open source Arduino IDE.


BLUETOOTH BOARD
This is an add-on board which sits on top of controller board. VEELER can be controlled by an Android application via Bluetooth.


VEELER CHASSIS
Now keeping in mind that users will be editing, upgrading and basically pounding away on this little robot, strength and tolerance becomes very important factors. Thus we have the all aluminum chassis making it almost unbreakable. Four wheel driven VEELER with all metal gear motors gives it the ability to  maneuver freely and allows it to almost turn on a dime. Drive it over mud, rocks, grass or sand, it just keeps going.


OLED
VEELER has a built-in OLED that can be used to display emotions, text or direction. Open Source library makes sure you can tweak and edit it.


POWER SOURCE
VEELER comes with 7.4v Lithium-ion battery holder with built in Battery Management System (BMS). Just add two 18650 batteries, turn on the switch and the fun begins. Out of juice? We have included a charger so that the fun continuous.

ROBOT MODES
VEELER can either run on Autonomous mode or manual control.
Autonomous Mode : Turn on Autonomous mode and the robot whizzes through any terrain while avoiding obstacles. The sonar sensor makes sure VEELER does not hit your cat.
Manual Mode : Use your remote controller or the mobile application to control the robot. Change its speed at run-time, LED colors and the buzzer, all while driving on sand, mud or grass.
Line Follower Mode : Attach two line following sensors and the robot surprises you by following a line. Add two tracks and challenge a race between two VEELER's.
Since there are additional free pins, adding multiple sensors is a breeze.

ONE ROBOT, ONE CHANGE
Gift your loved ones a VEELER and make a difference. VEELER helps them learn programming, mechanics and logic, all while having fun. This is a new way of STEM learning.

What do we do with the funds?
We are looking for funding to get this prototype into production.
Since the complete testing and development is complete, the funding will be used for manufacturing PCB's, Assembly, Laser cutting and anodizing of aluminum and lastly for marketing these products to every corner of the world

A Positive Impact

We would love to see the world change with technology. VEELER will help people understand the changing technology around
Inspires kids to think creatively to use VEELER in more ways as they come across new challenges
Since the robot is designed to be modular, users can add additional sensors and modules

We have spent the last year and a half working on this tiny yet powerful robot and are now ready to go from prototype to a finished product. We need your help to get this robot into production. Please help us make VEELER a reality and spread the word.",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

device tilts from one side to the other and plays three tones on a 
whistle when water is filled into the funnel at the top.   Sometimes
 referred to as trick devices, these machines, some of which were based 
on translations of Greek manuscripts, used - at the time - sophisticated
 technologies such as siphons, leavers, pistons, floats and clock 
mechanisms to astound their followers with magic, or more precise, trick
 them with technology. In order not to raise suspicion in the audience, 
the technology in these devices was hidden behind a facade, invisible to
 the user. All the audience did was pour water, pull a leaver or push a 
button and the machine did 'the magic'. They created a black box and a

Our Goals and Our CostsOur modest goal is to print 500 paperback copies of The Book of Ingenious Devices.  100 will be donated to libraries and 400 will be made available for consumer purchase.

Additional expenses are printing the books (not a small cost by any means), shipping out the books, and a small budget ($500) for advertising.
Because we can't do anything with, for example, three illustrations or half a translation, this is an all-or-nothing funding project.  If we surpass our goals, we'll be able to print more books, donate to more libraries, and offer a premium version of the book.

The internet image most commonly associated with our book is an automated clock depicting a man riding an elephant.  But that's a design of Al-Jazari's from 300 years later, not one by the Banū Mūsā.  We legitimately fear that if this important piece of scientific history is not reprinted,  it will be absorbed by Al-Jazari's later book in humanity's collective memory, or forgotten altogether.  
We also believe that a physical book serves a purpose and has a value as an instrument of learning in a classroom, a repository of knowledge in a library, or a method of conveying educational or cultural value when given to another person as a gift.   
Can We Do It?
  Spearheading this project is Patrick Rodgers, who as the CEO of an independent record label, guided nearly 100 albums from inception to store shelf, including one by Neil Gaiman.  If this project is fully funded, you can rest assured that we'll facilitate the publication of this book in a careful and professional manner.

Is This A Religious Book?
No. This is strictly a science book.  

Robots? Seriously?
By dictionary definition standards, yes. There are mechanical devices in here that are capable of operating on their own, including a water-powered organ that stayed in use for nearly a thousand years until it was replaced by the player piano.  There is an automatic flute player that some have argued may be the world's first programmable machine.  A number of very clever clock and fountain designs are here as well.  There's no Wall-E or Rosie the Robot to be found in this text, but the devices invented by the Musa brothers are far more advanced than what most people imagine existed in the 9th century.  Listen to three minutes (8:23-11:35) of  Fraunhofer Institute of Technology scholar Michael Wolf's lecture on The Book of Ingenious Devices:Wolf wrote, ""I had the privilege to be involved in a few museum and exhibition 
projects around the history of Science and Technology in the Middle East
 and it was then when I learned about the Banu Musa brothers, who 
authored the ""Book of ingenious devices"", which comprises of designs and
 plans for the most wondrous automata like this perpetual flute. This 
device tilts from one side to the other and plays three tones on a 
whistle when water is filled into the funnel at the top.   Sometimes
 referred to as trick devices, these machines, some of which were based 
on translations of Greek manuscripts, used - at the time - sophisticated
 technologies such as siphons, leavers, pistons, floats and clock 
mechanisms to astound their followers with magic, or more precise, trick
 them with technology. In order not to raise suspicion in the audience, 
the technology in these devices was hidden behind a facade, invisible to
 the user. All the audience did was pour water, pull a leaver or push a 
button and the machine did 'the magic'. They created a black box and a 
user interface.""You can also read a little more about the book on Wikipedia    If You Can't Contribute...

<p>We are three engineers who came to Bangladesh to work on garment sector for a European Brand and have been here since 2012,2014 and 2015.</p>
<p>People in this country are very friendly and we like to be here a lot but due to tough living conditions they are having lots of difficulties which make us feel sad. It is even dangerous for kids and not providing a future for them.</p>
<p>Due to our work, we are going many parts of the country to check the factories. This is how we found out an orphanage in a rural side of Dhaka, called Kishoreganj. 192 boys without a mother or father are living in this place and sleeping on the ground even without a pillow. In the same buildings, these 192 boys and also more 158 boys from the same village are getting education. They don't even have anything to write or read, just listening the teachers in the classes.</p>
<p>The buildings are not safe as they are very old with structural problems, full of rust and has humidity issue. The kitchen and toilets are a mess. Kids are cleaning their self in the dirty lake in front of the orphanage.</p>
<p>We have been trying to help them after we found out this place but what we can is limited so not solving their major problems. This is why we need your support.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487273593/mggfdqw2nxyowmb9hnzg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487275034/zm2nr94q7xoaitqopens.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Above is the plan of whole place. There are fours rooms where kids are sleeping and a classroom but the classroom is in a terrible condition, it may collapse anytime, this is why they use regular rooms as a classroom also. We want to fix those rooms and maintain the classroom, also build a single layer dormitory behind those buildings as there is a garden which belongs to orphanage but they don't use. This building and three small rooms will be used as dorms. Big room and classroom will be used as classroom because current classroom is not enough for 350 kids even we maintain it.</p>
<p>Also kitchen and toilets are in terrible condition. We can not even consider the kitchen as a kitchen which is actually more like a storage without any equipments except some rusty and dirty pots. There is no water in kitchen and toilets. Kids use the manual pump to get water and also clean their self in the dirty lake so we want to rebuild those and bring water to kitchen and toilets by using a water tank. Kids will also be able to have a shower with clean water.</p>
<p>We found constructors to discuss all of these to get a price by using our local contacts and they are asking 80.000USD to do all below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintaining four rooms.</li>
<li>Building a dormitory behind the existing building.</li>
<li>Rebuilding the kitchen and toilet, adding showers.</li>
<li>Providing 100 bunk beds for the kids who are sleeping in the orphanage.</li>
<li>Providing cupboards, mattresses, pillow and quilts.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we can collect more than this amount, we will provide materials to kids for better education. Build wall around the lake and extend the current garden which is small for 350 kids.</p>

<h3>Hey there!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This is us, Abdullah, Asad, Ahmed and Ayesha. We are siblings, and we are home-schooled, except Ahmed. He is our cousin that goes to a school. Rather feeling sorry for each-other, we work together.</p>
<p>And as we all three were home-schooled (never been through any formal education), our learning experience is different than others. We have learned by teaching and learning from each other. We want to give this opportunity to students, as they should be the ones asking, experimenting and even teaching to learn. That is why we are building a peer to peer learning portal for young learners like us (Technology and Design Enthusiasts).</p> <p>To get a better understanding of the leadership and learning environment (context Asia), we want to attend the ELLTA Conference 2017 (Exploring Leadership and Learning Theories in Asia; at Asian Institute of Technology Bangkok). We are thrilled to attend the conference, because it will help us invest in our knowledge portfolio. Not only that,  we are excited to immerse ourself around people who are working in the exciting field of leadership/ learning. It will give us great insight in our respected field.</p> <p><i>However, we need your help!</i> We want to attend ELLTA Conference 2017 (at AIT Bangkok) on the basis of the services that we can offer. We can help you with designing, we can run a social media campaigns, or even make a website.</p>
<p><br/><i>The ELLTA conference is a wonderful opportunity and it can help us mature as an entrepreneur. We will hate to miss it because of a plane ticket.</i></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Breakdown of Costs.</h3>
<p>We need you to give us work equivalent for the money we are asking for. The breakdown of the cost is:</p>
<p>Conference Fee: $75/Person (it has been reduced 50%)              $300 Total<br/>Airfare: $500/Person (Est. Airfare from KHI-BKK)                          $2000 Total<br/>Accommodation: $50/day (*2 Rooms * 5 days)                               $500 Total<br/>Other:  500$ (Visa, Food, etc.)                                                                 $500 Total<br/><br/>The total also includes 5% of Indiegogo's fee. </p>

This is us, Abdullah, Asad, Ahmed and Ayesha. We are siblings, and we are home-schooled, except Ahmed. He is our cousin that goes to a school. Rather feeling sorry for each-other, we work together.
And as we all three were home-schooled (never been through any formal education), our learning experience is different than others. We have learned by teaching and learning from each other. We want to give this opportunity to students, as they should be the ones asking, experimenting and even teaching to learn. That is why we are building a peer to peer learning portal for young learners like us (Technology and Design Enthusiasts). To get a better understanding of the leadership and learning environment (context Asia), we want to attend the ELLTA Conference 2017 (Exploring Leadership and Learning Theories in Asia; at Asian Institute of Technology Bangkok). We are thrilled to attend the conference, because it will help us invest in our knowledge portfolio. Not only that,  we are excited to immerse ourself around people who are working in the exciting field of leadership/ learning. It will give us great insight in our respected field. However, we need your help! We want to attend ELLTA Conference 2017 (at AIT Bangkok) on the basis of the services that we can offer. We can help you with designing, we can run a social media campaigns, or even make a website.
The ELLTA conference is a wonderful opportunity and it can help us mature as an entrepreneur. We will hate to miss it because of a plane ticket.
 

Breakdown of Costs.
We need you to give us work equivalent for the money we are asking for. The breakdown of the cost is:
Conference Fee: $75/Person (it has been reduced 50%)              $300 TotalAirfare: $500/Person (Est. Airfare from KHI-BKK)                          $2000 TotalAccommodation: $50/day (*2 Rooms * 5 days)                               $500 TotalOther:  500$ (Visa, Food, etc.)                                                                 $500 TotalThe total also includes 5% of Indiegogo's fee. 
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Help spread the word out. If you think you don't have any work for us...help us out by letting others know what we wish to achieve. 
 Our ProjectsTEDDict is an online peer learning portal for young students that makes learning more interesting by keeping it diverse and personalised. TEDDict allows students to learn their own way – connect with each other, share a diverse portfolio of concepts and learn with each other’s help in a more gamified environment. The aim is to encourage entrepreneurial skills in students, as it is an e-learning solution that gives the student an active role to learn what they decide. TEDDict has gathered the audience of 900+ students through peer learning activities. TEDDict has covered 12 workshops and 9 sessions on Visual Programming, Brain Sciences, and Homeschooling in schools and other educational institutes.  One of the social-innovation projects (under TEDDict) was 'Design your own world' drawing book for children. The main purpose was to provide moral education to kids through the activity they enjoy the most - drawing & coloring. We have already distributed tens of thousands of these books through our project partner Vital Group of Companies and we're currently working on the second edition (Ramzan Special). Which is coming very soon... very very soon!   Yet, our favorite project is LavaDew. Launched in late 2014, we officially started providing marketing and branding services to different companies in Pakistan. We enjoy this project the most because we have the opportunity to work with some great people; we truly learned a lot. Our clients included one of the fastest growing tea-brands of Pakistan (Vital Tea) and international academic networks including AFTeL and E-LLSA. To learn more about LavaDew, check out our website. http://lavadew.com/ One of our innovative projects was a diary-styled book. Dad Logics is a book written by Asad Ullah . In this book Asad tried to illustrate the trend in which 'things that dad says' do not make sense. Throughout the story, Asad tries making sense out of his unpredictable dad. Sticking to one set of rule contradicts with the other set of a rule imposed by his dad. Making it funny; for others. Ayesha is the co-story teller for this book. You can access the book at Amazon.Above is a word~cloud of our skills, as we wish to earn the trip in exchange for our skills.. feel free to give us any work that is within our scope.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>IOT can reach its full potential only when professionals from all industries can apply their innovative minds directly to this technology. It should be easy to learn IOT. </p>
<p>Today devices like the Arduino, Raspberry pi, etc.,  are available which has made it possible for more and more people to get into this field. However  when you go out and try to start learning IOT, you would still be expected to know the basics of electronics, know how to install and configure linux systems or understand how to write code in C.</p>
<p>And for beginners, there is always a fear when it comes to handling electronics. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Should I connect the wire to this pin or that one?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What if I do something and spoil some components or the entire board itself?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What if I make a mistake and there is a smoke or fire hazard?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These are apprehensions that are quite natural for anybody who is new to Electronics</p>
<p>The WiNoT™ Trainer kit comes preassembled with all components and so even somebody without any electronics background can start learning IOT. You are not expected to know anything about electronics, or have experience in software languages. As long as you know how to install applications on your computer, you can get started. Of course if you already know about programming or basics of electronics, it will make it much more easier.</p>
<h3>What's in the kit</h3>
<p>The kit mainly contains two components:</p>
<ol>
<li>A board with popular sensors and output devices mounted on to it</li>
<li>Complimented with a well structured tutorial</li>
</ol>
<p>The WiNoT™ trainer board which has the ESP8266 as the controller with 5 sensors, one LED, one buzzer and one relay assembled on the board. Once you open the standard trainer kit from the box, you can start using it right away - there is no need for any assembly, soldering or even wiring. The video below gives a detailed overview of the board</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Plonau85P1I?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the highlights of this kit is the accompanying tutorial. The tutorial is a detailed course in itself. The tutorial is a collection of different types of learning material like books, videos, quizzes and other e-learning content. The tutorial has been structured in such a way that it assumes no prior knowledge of electronics or programming. Using a step-by-step style, the tutorial will guide you on IOT. By the time you have completed the course, you will be able to create simple IOT solutions using Python. </p>
<div><ol></ol></div>
<div>
<h3>Intuitive Approach</h3>
<p>When it comes to the coding part of WiNoT™, we have completely simplified the process. <br/>First of all, we built the firmware in such a way that it takes cares of most of the heavy-lifting. This is complemented with a python library which is installed on the computer. This combination makes it possible to write IOT code that is very intuitive and easy to understand. <strong>If it is easy to understand, then it becomes easy to learn </strong><br/><br/>The following videos show a few examples of using the WiNoT™ trainer. After seeing this video, you will be able to appreciate the fact that it is really very simple to develop IOT solutions using WiNoT™ <br/><br/>In the first demo, we will start off with controlling the onboard LED and Buzzer.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/qcSvpyx74f0?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>In the following demo, we will see how to detect motion, how to measure distance and how to check the light intensity</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/f1G09IZ0-KE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>In the last demo, we will see how to build integrated IOT solutions by combining one or more sensors and output devices.</p>
<p>As a side note the WiNoT™ trainer is an educational product and its sole purpose is to assist in IOT Learning. We do not recommend building complete IOT solutions using the trainer. To build IOT solutions, we have an<strong> upcoming product, WiNoT™ developer board. </strong></p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fhc0i4bWZeY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Please check the FAQ to see what is the WiNoT™ developer board and why your <strong>support to this campaign </strong>is critical for us to bring the developer board to market. </p>
</div>
<ol></ol>
</div><div>
<h3>Why did we create the trainer?</h3>
<p>We ran into practical difficulties when we wanted to automate our new office. Here's what Raghu Venkataramana, the founder of Qantom and the architect of WiNoT™ has to say:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Around six months ago, when I set out to create an IOT centre of competence, I had several IOT related ideas. I first started off with a requirement to make my office building into a simple connected solution. Since I wanted Qantom to be focussed on IOT, I only thought that it was right to <strong>build our own</strong> solution. I had a very tight budget for this project as it was for internal consumption. Also it had no inherent commercial value. Thanks to these constraints I hired a few interns and got started by beginning to train them. <br/>During the course of the journey, I experienced the challenge and </i><i>difficulty of training  people who had no knowledge of electronics and/or developing using embedded C</i><i>. And hence I shifted the first priority from automating our office building to building a training kit for IOT.  And here we are today!.</i></p>
<h3>Where We are and What We Need </h3>
<p>The WiNoT™ trainer is currently in an advance prototyping stage. Functionally, it is a fully working prototype. In terms of the hardware, everything has been implemented and tested. The firmware has been written although there are some enhancements pending.  We have done basic testing but comprehensive testing has still note been done on the firmware. The book is currently work in progress and has still not been printed. </p>
<p>We need the funds to fabricate and assemble the PCB in larger quantities and to publish the book. And most of all, if we can reach our target for this campaign, it will give us a boost to spend our time and money on the dev-kit. See the FAQ for more on this. </p>
<p>In the previous section,  all the demo videos and the configuration / setup videos have been created an actual working product but in a studio setup. A gallery of a few other photos in our office and workshop:</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the years to come, IOT skills will become a part of every other technology and will not be a skill in itself. The WiNoT Trainer is a step forward in making IOT accessible to a wider audience and helping everybody to be a part of this growing revolution. </p>
<h3><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Hardware :</strong><br/>Any product that involves hardware has inherent risks –<br/>a) Fabricating a working PCB and<br/>b) supply/availability of required components in sufficient numbers.<br/>Since we have already created a fully working prototype, this risk is almost negligible. <br/>From the current prototype we only plan to make aesthetic changes to product - like repositioning a couple of sensors. <br/>In terms of availability of components and sensors, this risk is largely mitigated as we have carefully selected only those sensors &amp; devices which are readily available from multiple sources</p>
<p><strong>Shipping &amp; Logistics</strong><br/>When it comes to international processing and shipping, there are risks of delay that are attached to it. However these are usually just a few days and hence doesn't impact that the project delivery in a very significant way.</p>
<p>We will report to our supporters about any setback if they occur and make every effort to solve them.</p>

When it comes to the coding part of WiNoT™, we have completely simplified the process. First of all, we built the firmware in such a way that it takes cares of most of the heavy-lifting. This is complemented with a python library which is installed on the computer. This combination makes it possible to write IOT code that is very intuitive and easy to understand. If it is easy to understand, then it becomes easy to learn The following videos show a few examples of using the WiNoT™ trainer. After seeing this video, you will be able to appreciate the fact that it is really very simple to develop IOT solutions using WiNoT™ In the first demo, we will start off with controlling the onboard LED and Buzzer.

In the following demo, we will see how to detect motion, how to measure distance and how to check the light intensity

 
In the last demo, we will see how to build integrated IOT solutions by combining one or more sensors and output devices.
As a side note the WiNoT™ trainer is an educational product and its sole purpose is to assist in IOT Learning. We do not recommend building complete IOT solutions using the trainer. To build IOT solutions, we have an upcoming product, WiNoT™ developer board. 

Please check the FAQ to see what is the WiNoT™ developer board and why your support to this campaign is critical for us to bring the developer board to market. 



Why did we create the trainer?
We ran into practical difficulties when we wanted to automate our new office. Here's what Raghu Venkataramana, the founder of Qantom and the architect of WiNoT™ has to say:
Around six months ago, when I set out to create an IOT centre of competence, I had several IOT related ideas. I first started off with a requirement to make my office building into a simple connected solution. Since I wanted Qantom to be focussed on IOT, I only thought that it was right to build our own solution. I had a very tight budget for this project as it was for internal consumption. Also it had no inherent commercial value. Thanks to these constraints I hired a few interns and got started by beginning to train them. During the course of the journey, I experienced the challenge and difficulty of training  people who had no knowledge of electronics and/or developing using embedded C. And hence I shifted the first priority from automating our office building to building a training kit for IOT.  And here we are today!.
Where We are and What We Need 
The WiNoT™ trainer is currently in an advance prototyping stage. Functionally, it is a fully working prototype. In terms of the hardware, everything has been implemented and tested. The firmware has been written although there are some enhancements pending.  We have done basic testing but comprehensive testing has still note been done on the firmware. The book is currently work in progress and has still not been printed. 
We need the funds to fabricate and assemble the PCB in larger quantities and to publish the book. And most of all, if we can reach our target for this campaign, it will give us a boost to spend our time and money on the dev-kit. See the FAQ for more on this. 
In the previous section,  all the demo videos and the configuration / setup videos have been created an actual working product but in a studio setup. A gallery of a few other photos in our office and workshop:
     
   
   
A bit more on the perks...
Depending on your needs and expertise level, you can choose your reward options. We hope that the below table will assist you in making the right choice.


The Impact
In the years to come, IOT skills will become a part of every other technology and will not be a skill in itself. The WiNoT Trainer is a step forward in making IOT accessible to a wider audience and helping everybody to be a part of this growing revolution. 
Risks and Challenges

Hardware :Any product that involves hardware has inherent risks –a) Fabricating a working PCB andb) supply/availability of required components in sufficient numbers.Since we have already created a fully working prototype, this risk is almost negligible. From the current prototype we only plan to make aesthetic changes to product - like repositioning a couple of sensors. In terms of availability of components and sensors, this risk is largely mitigated as we have carefully selected only those sensors & devices which are readily available from multiple sources
Shipping & LogisticsWhen it comes to international processing and shipping, there are risks of delay that are attached to it. However these are usually just a few days and hence doesn't impact that the project delivery in a very significant way.
We will report to our supporters about any setback if they occur and make every effort to solve them.

<h3 style=""color: #A01E21 !important;"">Why ancient Olympia? </h3>
<p><b>Ancient Olympia is a place of outstanding universal value</b> the most celebrated sanctuary of ancient Greece, and the birthplace of the most important athletic event of all times; the Olympic Games.</p>
<p>It is a symbol of peace, fair competition, humanism and a perfect starting point for coming in touch with the ideals of ancient Greece. An inspiration for students of all ages. Inhabited since prehistoric times established in the history of culture as the most important religious, political and sports center with one of the highest concentrations of masterpieces from the ancient Greek world a milestone in the history of art a unique universal symbol of peace and competition at the service of virtue demonstrates above all the lofty ideals of Hellenic humanism: peaceful and loyal competition between free and equal men... with their only ambition being the symbolic reward of an olive wreath </p>

According to the <strong><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/alanhall/2013/03/11/im-outta-here-why-2-million-americans-quit-every-month-and-5-steps-to-turn-the-epidemic-around/#70dfd4ebf9fe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Department of Labor Statistics</a></strong>, more than 2 million people quit their jobs in 2013. Why are so many people quitting? 1) They don’t like their boss. 2) The lack of empowerment, 3) Internal politics, and, 4) Lack of recognition.  In the past, a corporate job provided promotions and ultimately retirement with 401K savings and pensions. Those days are over!  Don’t find fault and blame others. Do something by learning about business ownership. If you or someone you know feels destined to start a business, it’s time to ask, if not now, when will I start my own business?</p>

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Strong evidence indicates that enterprise education increases the opportunity to get started in business.  At A4E, participants will learn the importance of managing their financials, as well as how to develop superior products and services. Each course will focus on goal setting and learning how to adapt those goals based on market conditions and other factors. Having expert entrepreneurs available, helps to minimize the guesswork associated with having a successful launch.  Entrepreneurship is a legitimate alternative to being a wage earner. When entrepreneurship flourishes, families, communities, society as a hold becomes the benefactor.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>To help us mitigate risk, the A4E team has instituted Google Analytics for tracking engagement. Participant questionnaires are implemented to stay in touch with the end user's needs, likes and dislikes.  Monitoring and addressing challenges as they arise, helps to diffuse an avalanche of challenges coming upon us all at once. The objective  - recognize a problem as soon as we are made aware of it and fix it.  Academy4Entrepreneurs also has the privilege of a strong business advisory team which includes affluent entrepreneurs who are experienced in launching similar platform's as A4E's.</p>

Expert Entrepreneurs



 

 
""Evidence shows that job growth and the U.S. economy will never return to 2008 pre-recession labor market conditions.”-Washington Center for Equitable Growth. According to the Department of Labor Statistics, more than 2 million people quit their jobs in 2013. Why are so many people quitting? 1) They don’t like their boss. 2) The lack of empowerment, 3) Internal politics, and, 4) Lack of recognition.  In the past, a corporate job provided promotions and ultimately retirement with 401K savings and pensions. Those days are over!  Don’t find fault and blame others. Do something by learning about business ownership. If you or someone you know feels destined to start a business, it’s time to ask, if not now, when will I start my own business?

 

A4E includes a mission driven component where courses include sign language interpretation and 508 software. 508 software insures access by individuals with disabilities so that they too can learn to fulfill their dreams of business ownership. Inclusion for all is paramount so that we can begin to reduce barriers to success for Everyone!

What We Need
Your contribution of $25, $75, $200, or $400 will help us get the beta version of A4E up and running.
& What You Get

Imagine - entire generations of business owners who are creating jobs and strengthening the economy. It’s possible!!!!
Our crowdfunding fundraising goal achievable is $20,000!


At $20,000 we can get the beta version of A4E up and running. Without the $20,000, we won’t be able to create the leaning portal in beta, and individuals interested in business ownership will be forced to try and figure out on their own how to avert failure in business.

At $40,000,we can include five additional courses: 1)Strategic Growth Procedures, 2)Process Mapping, 3) Best Operational Practices, 4)Succession planning 5)Exiting, sign language interpretation and  508 software. 

 
Our crowdfunding perks:

$25.00-I just want to support this initiative
$75.00-Attend the pre-launch networking event and meet the A4E community and participating entrepreneurs who will provide course instruction.
Gold level-$200.00-Access the Academy4Entrepreneurs website pre-beta (pre-beta is an intermediate stage, provided to a select few, and available for a select number of days)
Platinum level -$400-Pre-launch –Receive individual coaching with an industry expert entrepreneur. This level also includes pre-launch access to training material to the course of your choosing (a special selection of expert entrepreneurs will be available for this exclusive service which will only be provided to a select few). Platinum level also includes those perks listed at $75.00 and Gold level.

We're a fixed campaign on Indiegogo.  That means contributors are charged right away but will be refunded if we don't reach your goal. 
The Impact
Strong evidence indicates that enterprise education increases the opportunity to get started in business.  At A4E, participants will learn the importance of managing their financials, as well as how to develop superior products and services. Each course will focus on goal setting and learning how to adapt those goals based on market conditions and other factors. Having expert entrepreneurs available, helps to minimize the guesswork associated with having a successful launch.  Entrepreneurship is a legitimate alternative to being a wage earner. When entrepreneurship flourishes, families, communities, society as a hold becomes the benefactor.
Risks & Challenges
To help us mitigate risk, the A4E team has instituted Google Analytics for tracking engagement. Participant questionnaires are implemented to stay in touch with the end user's needs, likes and dislikes.  Monitoring and addressing challenges as they arise, helps to diffuse an avalanche of challenges coming upon us all at once. The objective  - recognize a problem as soon as we are made aware of it and fix it.  Academy4Entrepreneurs also has the privilege of a strong business advisory team which includes affluent entrepreneurs who are experienced in launching similar platform's as A4E's.

living in informal settlements and slums tends to grow up fast, they become the
informal solution to their families struggling to deal with daily problems

step into the role of productive contributors to help the household make ends

Children
living in informal settlements and slums tends to grow up fast, they become the
informal solution to their families struggling to deal with daily problems
involving infrastructure access and livelihoods. These children often has to
take up roles such as watch over younger siblings, sick household members, and
step into the role of productive contributors to help the household make ends
meet.Most

with these responsibilities, they often limit or forego their schooling,

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Become Your Own Protector</h3>
<p>With your help, we are building a state-of-the-art indoor shooting range in Orlando, FL. We are two US Navy Veterans that are a husband and wife team with multiple certifications and experience training gun owners. Visit our website, ComptonCombatArms.com or check us out on social media to see what we've been up to.</p>
<p>This facility is dedicated to you and your training. It is designed to equip you with the ability to keep your family safe. It’s to strengthen your 2nd Amendment rights and will have dedicated Instructors passionate about self defense and empowering you to become your own self protector. It’s part of a vision to take time-honored sporting traditions to a new generation.  </p>
<p>This is your chance to get some perks that will never be offered again. Why not be a part of something special? This is your opportunity to pitch in and be involved in building your community. You will be proud to know you were a part of the small beginnings of a company that is going to make a huge impact in Central Florida.  </p>
<p>All Well or Nothing....that's who we are. A time honored tradition of the Compton family for centuries. Doing everything to the very best of our ability is the only option. </p>
<p>So why should you contribute to this project? Because we will make it well worth your while.</p>
<p>Out of respect for your time and money, we’ve included a lot of information for you.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We already have the range equipment, we just need the funding to get the build out of the facility done and permits. With the Management, Instructors and full Staff standing by locked and loaded, we need you.</p>
<p>Why contribute?</p>
<ul>
<li>Once in a lifetime offers. We will NEVER offer deals like this again. Get it while you can!</li>
<li>Special recognition that will identify you as a ""Founding Funder.""</li>
<li>You'll be making a difference in the local community. No other range in the area is promoting safe gun ownership and continued education and training like we will be offering.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>FOUR REASONS WHY YOU CAN'T MISS THIS OPPORTUNITY</strong></p>
<p>1)  ONCE IN A LIFETIME PERKS</p>
<p>Sometimes you’ve only got one chance at an amazing deal. These packages will never be available again. Like a sniper with one shot, this is it. Breathe in, breath out, pause...squeeze the trigger.</p>
<p>2)  BUILD THE WORLD YOU WANT</p>
<p>Central Florida needs a training facility. The certification process for owning firearms in Florida only requires a basic firearm safety class. What happens is that citizens go to the gun show or their local gun shop and take an abbreviated course. Sometimes, not even involving live fire but using an airsoft pistol. This results in unequipped people with a false sense of security. Compton Combat Arms is the bridge to take normal, everyday citizen and turn them into well equipped, safe and knowledgeable gun owners. This facility will be a crisp, modern training center that supports those needs.  </p>
<p>If you intend to use a firearm to protect your home, <strong>PROPER TRAINING IS A MUST.</strong> Compton Combat Arms will provide an array of instructional classes designed to teach you and your family the safe, effective, proper use and storage of firearms. Safer homes means safer communities.</p>
<p>3)  MAKE A DIFFERENCE  </p>
<p>You have a chance to support responsible gun ownership.</p>
<p>Most of us had someone take the time to teach us the value of gun safety. Someone who taught us that responsible gun ownership improves the safety for the entire community. This is your chance to pay it forward. </p>
<p>Maybe you're concerned about the current gun laws, but not sure how to make a difference. Compton Combat Arms will provide an atmosphere that creates responsible gun owners one experience at a time, strengthening our Second Amendment Rights. </p>
<p>4)  TRAIN INTENTIONALLY</p>
<p>You are a legally permitted CCW holder. Have you ever practiced drawing from the holster? Speed and accuracy training? Moving and shooting? Utilizing cover and concealment? All the things you can't do at an indoor gun range in Central Florida. This is exactly what we are building. With your membership, you can come in, go to your stall, raise the bench and do holster work. Or maybe you want to move the firing line forward and use cover, we can accommodate that. With dedicated Range Safety Officers in the range at all times ensuring the safety of you and others, we can offer not only instructional training but you can train how you want with very few limitations. So get excited! Because you can now turn those dream's into a reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So........, if any of this excites you, here's what you should do:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mix and match any (or all) of the following:</p>
<p>1)  Pick a perk! - Just click the grey boxes on the right.  (more info listed below)</p>
<p>2)  Send this page to people you know will be interested.</p>
<p>3)  ""Like"" Compton Combat Arms on Facebook  and follow us on Instagram and Twitter</p>
<p>4)  Share your thoughts with us!  Suggestions and encouragement mean a lot to us. Especially          during this phase. If you want something, TELL US. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why are we doing this?</strong></p>
<p>The simplest answer to this question is that there are too many fly by night Instructors providing inadequate firearm training in unsafe gun ranges. Plus, unfortunately people get their CCW permit and never train again, yet they still carry a firearm. Our goal is to provide a safe indoor gun range and training facility that develops citizens to become their own protectors. Dedicated to training, not just a revolving door of people wanting to go out and just shoot a gun. All too often, like so many, we've been to other indoor ranges and left because we didn't feel safe with the people that were in there. Not anymore. All members will go through an orientation and will be vetted prior to ever stepping foot in the range with a firearm. </p>
<p><strong>Why Should You Care?</strong></p>
<p>We are genuinely passionate about helping other people enjoy the sport of shooting and learning how to use a firearm as just another tool. Compton Combat Arms will provide a positive, safe, and low pressure environment for all shooters, especially those new to the sport. We have already built a reputation in Central Florida for safe, effective firearm training. Also, with a female as our lead instructor, we've been able to make a huge impact in the female market of this industry. We are often sought out by those new to shooting that want to learn to protect themselves. We look forward to helping the new and timid become acquainted with the basics of firearm safety, operations, and marksmanship. Furthermore, we are excited to help those with basic to intermediate knowledge test their skills and push their limits to become safer and more equipped. We hope Compton Combat Arms will extend the values and positive experiences of a responsible firearm community.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that education, training, and exposure are key factors in decreasing the number of gun related incidents and gun violence across our country. With specialized skill based classes and personal instruction, Compton Combat Arms will enlighten and equip people to be responsible gun owners. We feel that our youth should be educated about firearms in a safe and controlled environment. Our facility will provide this by keeping it safe but also fun. We've found that educating youth about firearm safety, purpose and proper use removes curiosity and builds respect for firearms. Educated kids are safe kids.</p>
<p>Compton Combat Arms will also be a great example to our state officials and the nation on some of the positive aspects of firearm usage. We plan to reduce ignorance and negligence with respect to the functionality, purpose, and legal use of firearms. We hope that with enhanced experiences and real understanding, we can demonstrate to our community, elected officials in Florida and our nation that lawful gun ownership enhances our lives. Safe gun ownership is a pillar of the American way of life that we will protect and promote.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Here are the PERKS!</strong></h2>

This is a great opportunity to work together in promoting safe and responsible gun ownership for companies in the 2A community.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>No one is locked into any one amount.</i></strong> You can donate $1 or all the $125k  You don’t have to get a perk, but we think that it’s a pretty good way to give to the cause and get yourself a great deal in the process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What will it look like?</strong></p>
<p>The video above is the actual range before it was taken down to be relocated that will be installed.</p>
<p><i>Shooting Lanes:</i></p>
<p>Our plan is to start out with 8-10 lanes. This range utilizes frangible ammunition. So yes, you can shoot steel in the indoor range. Crazy right? Each lane will have individual stalls, separating you from other shooters.  They are high quality, heavy-duty clear stalls. And yes, they are bulletproof!  Each lane will also have a shooter’s table to load your firearms/magazines. This table is movable meaning you can lift it up and draw from your holster.  You will also have an area behind you where you can store your gear when you aren't using it, keeping the firing line safe and uncluttered. </p>

<p><i>Target Systems: </i></p>
<p>The target retrieval systems are electronic systems made by Action Targets allowing you to determine the length and reset your targets with a push of a button. No need to wait for a cease-fire to manually move your targets. These targets can be programmed to move and flip while you are shooting, </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558993886/sa1er4mizbzojcugtade.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p><i>Ventilation System: </i></p>
<p>This is the most costly component of the range. Our customers’ health is not going to be compromised. Even though we are using frangible ammunition and there isn't any lead exposure, the powder and smoke still needs to be filtered. </p>
<p>Our ventilation system will exceed NIOSH, EPA, and OSHA air quality standards and maintain a 100% success rate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Simulation Range:</i></p>
<p>We will have, separate from the main range, a simulation range that utilizes simulation ammunition. Under the direct supervision of a Range Safety Officer, you will be able to run through our Simulator that is designed to test your abilities. The scenarios will change weekly and can even be done on a lunch break. The simulation ammunition can be man marking rounds or blanks that enable a vast array of scenarios from clearing rooms to an active shooter situation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>The Shop</i>:</p>
<p>Our rental shop will carry the latest and greatest rifles, pistols,  and shotguns. We will have frangible ammunition of every caliber for purchase along with simulation ammunition. There will be a small amount of accessories available for purchase such as eyes and ears, range bags, holsters etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Lounge:</i></p>
<p>Our range will be a destination. Whether you come by alone or with a group of friends and family, we want to have a place with a sense of community.  We will have comfy couches and big screen TV’s. Will there be coffee you ask? We are Navy Veterans, of course there will be coffee. We are presently working out a deal with a very popular coffee company that is has a very loud voice for the Second Amendment.</p>
<p><i>Class Rooms:</i> </p>
<p>Our classrooms will hold up to 12 students each.  We will have multiple classes throughout the week that range from first time classes up to instructor level courses and advanced tactics in every discipline. We also will be offering safety classes to certify RSO's and even trauma medicine classes. So if you are just starting out or a seasoned veteran, at Compton Combat Arms, you can find the training you are looking for. </p>
<p><i>Non-Affiliated Instructors:</i></p>
<p>Through the purchase of an Instructor Membership, we will allow other Instructors to utilize the range to teach. We are in this together and shouldn't be competing against each other. You will be required to go through a strict approval process, but once approved, you'll be able to schedule your own classes at our range. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Are you STILL reading this?</strong></p>
<p>If so, you clearly care about this and YOU SHOULD BE INVOLVED!  You should put your name on this project. We are building an amazing training facility like no other. You don't want to find yourself five years from now saying, ""I wish I would've gotten involved from the beginning.""</p>
<p>Grab a perk while you can, and send us an email at ccatraining@comptoncombatarms.com and share your thoughts! We are still developing this facility, your input could actually change what we do. Tell us what you want!</p>
<p>We look forward to meeting you, shaking your hand and saying ""Thank You!"" </p>

Also, with a female as our lead instructor, we've been able to make a huge impact in the female market of this industry. We are often sought out by those new to shooting that want to learn to protect themselves. We look forward to helping the new and timid become acquainted with the basics of firearm safety, operations, and marksmanship. Furthermore, we are excited to help those with basic to intermediate knowledge test their skills and push their limits to become safer and more equipped. We hope Compton Combat Arms will extend the values and positive experiences of a responsible firearm community.
We firmly believe that education, training, and exposure are key factors in decreasing the number of gun related incidents and gun violence across our country. With specialized skill based classes and personal instruction, Compton Combat Arms will enlighten and equip people to be responsible gun owners. We feel that our youth should be educated about firearms in a safe and controlled environment. Our facility will provide this by keeping it safe but also fun. We've found that educating youth about firearm safety, purpose and proper use removes curiosity and builds respect for firearms. Educated kids are safe kids.
Compton Combat Arms will also be a great example to our state officials and the nation on some of the positive aspects of firearm usage. We plan to reduce ignorance and negligence with respect to the functionality, purpose, and legal use of firearms. We hope that with enhanced experiences and real understanding, we can demonstrate to our community, elected officials in Florida and our nation that lawful gun ownership enhances our lives. Safe gun ownership is a pillar of the American way of life that we will protect and promote.

No one is locked into any one amount. You can donate $1 or all the $125k  You don’t have to get a perk, but we think that it’s a pretty good way to give to the cause and get yourself a great deal in the process.
 
What will it look like?
The video above is the actual range before it was taken down to be relocated that will be installed.
Shooting Lanes:
Our plan is to start out with 8-10 lanes. This range utilizes frangible ammunition. So yes, you can shoot steel in the indoor range. Crazy right? Each lane will have individual stalls, separating you from other shooters.  They are high quality, heavy-duty clear stalls. And yes, they are bulletproof!  Each lane will also have a shooter’s table to load your firearms/magazines. This table is movable meaning you can lift it up and draw from your holster.  You will also have an area behind you where you can store your gear when you aren't using it, keeping the firing line safe and uncluttered. 

Target Systems: 
The target retrieval systems are electronic systems made by Action Targets allowing you to determine the length and reset your targets with a push of a button. No need to wait for a cease-fire to manually move your targets. These targets can be programmed to move and flip while you are shooting, 


Ventilation System: 
This is the most costly component of the range. Our customers’ health is not going to be compromised. Even though we are using frangible ammunition and there isn't any lead exposure, the powder and smoke still needs to be filtered. 
Our ventilation system will exceed NIOSH, EPA, and OSHA air quality standards and maintain a 100% success rate.
 
Simulation Range:
We will have, separate from the main range, a simulation range that utilizes simulation ammunition. Under the direct supervision of a Range Safety Officer, you will be able to run through our Simulator that is designed to test your abilities. The scenarios will change weekly and can even be done on a lunch break. The simulation ammunition can be man marking rounds or blanks that enable a vast array of scenarios from clearing rooms to an active shooter situation.
 
The Shop:
Our rental shop will carry the latest and greatest rifles, pistols,  and shotguns. We will have frangible ammunition of every caliber for purchase along with simulation ammunition. There will be a small amount of accessories available for purchase such as eyes and ears, range bags, holsters etc.
 
Lounge:
Our range will be a destination. Whether you come by alone or with a group of friends and family, we want to have a place with a sense of community.  We will have comfy couches and big screen TV’s. Will there be coffee you ask? We are Navy Veterans, of course there will be coffee. We are presently working out a deal with a very popular coffee company that is has a very loud voice for the Second Amendment.
Class Rooms: 
Our classrooms will hold up to 12 students each.  We will have multiple classes throughout the week that range from first time classes up to instructor level courses and advanced tactics in every discipline. We also will be offering safety classes to certify RSO's and even trauma medicine classes. So if you are just starting out or a seasoned veteran, at Compton Combat Arms, you can find the training you are looking for. 
Non-Affiliated Instructors:
Through the purchase of an Instructor Membership, we will allow other Instructors to utilize the range to teach. We are in this together and shouldn't be competing against each other. You will be required to go through a strict approval process, but once approved, you'll be able to schedule your own classes at our range. 
Are you STILL reading this?
If so, you clearly care about this and YOU SHOULD BE INVOLVED!  You should put your name on this project. We are building an amazing training facility like no other. You don't want to find yourself five years from now saying, ""I wish I would've gotten involved from the beginning.""
Grab a perk while you can, and send us an email at ccatraining@comptoncombatarms.com and share your thoughts! We are still developing this facility, your input could actually change what we do. Tell us what you want!
We look forward to meeting you, shaking your hand and saying ""Thank You!"" 
Stay safe, become your own protector.

<p>We have been developing the Alexa Skills for Learners series, with the Spelling Teacher and the Genius Flashcard.  We want the Spelling Teacher to reach a larger user base and help all students with learning spelling.</p>
<h2><strong>What is Spelling Teacher?</strong></h2>
<p>Spelling Teacher is an Amazon Alexa skill that helps parents with their student's spelling lessons. The skill will read the words, leave time for the student to write it down before moving to the next word. It also listens the student spelling the word immediately, so Alexa will verify the answer. The basic access supports English words. The premium access allows for spelling of French and Spanish words.</p>
<h2>What are we funding?</h2>
<p>The Alexa Skill runs in the cloud, and requires internet domain name and servers maintenance. We want to add new features and unique capabilities. Additionally, we want to expand the usage of the skill and promote it to new users by distributing postcards as well as increase the online presence.</p>
<h2>How is the Skill working?</h2>
<p>The typical usage is as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask Spelling Teacher to Create a new lesson</li>
<li>Open the email, and Enter the lesson in the online form</li>
<li>Student : Alexa, ask Spelling Teacher to Start a New Lesson</li>
<li>Alexa: The first word is : "" Welcome ""</li>
<li>Student: writes the word down and ask to move to "" Next Word ""</li>
<li>Alternatively, the student can say "" The Spelling is: W E L C O M E "" and Alexa will confirm</li>
<li>Once the lesson is completed, it can be re-played and the spelling self checked. The student would ask to ""Spell this word"" after each word to have Alexa helping with verifying the student's spelling.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Skill also features a verification of the alphabet order, with 2 modes: by ABC order or by position.</p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>The skill is already available. We want to promote its usage. If we are successful, we will need to extend our servers capabilities. We are using a commercial hosting solution, that can easily scale to our needs. Since our servers run several applications, the only challenge is to re-partition the current distribution.<br/> </p>

<p>We are planning to address <em>7 major</em> features in first <em>6 months</em>:</p>
<h3>1. Support for MongoDB 3.x storages (WiredTiger and others)</h3>
<p>From version 3.0 MongoDB introduces new pluggable storage architecture and WiredTiger storage engine. Currently Robomongo only supports <a href=""https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/mmapv1/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MMAPv1</a> storage engine. From version 3.2 MongoDB starts to use WiredTiger <a href=""https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-17861"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">by default</a>. We plan to add support for WiredTiger first and work on other storage engines, such as In Memory and Encrypted storages right after.</p>
<h3>2. Support for V8 JavaScript engine</h3>
<p>At the moment, Robomongo is based on SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine. Since MongoDB <a href=""https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-2407"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2.3.1</a>, JavaScript engine was changed from SpiderMonkey to Google V8. But starting from <a href=""http://blog.mongodb.org/post/130823293808/mongodb-319-is-released"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">3.1.9</a> MongoDB is based on SpiderMonkey again. To support all versions of the MongoDB we need to implement V8 JavaScript engine and this is quite a lot of work. MongoDB 3.2 soon will be a production-ready release and we plan to focus on that release first, while still considering support for all versions of the MongoDB.</p>
<h3>3. Support for Replica Sets</h3>
<p>Supporting connections to the Replica Sets is one of the <a href=""https://github.com/paralect/robomongo/issues/116"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">most awaiting</a> features. This feature, along with two above, is our first priority and should cover needs of the major part of the Robomongo community.</p>
<h3>4. In-place edit when in tree or table view</h3>
<p>We think, that in place edit is a one of the best UX improvements we can make. This improvement should make use of Robomongo more efficient than it ever was.</p>
<h3>5. Copying of documents, collections and databases</h3>
<p>Copying documents, collections and databases are operations which are used very often in development and production. We want to add proper support for them.</p>
<h3>6. Export and import to/from JSON and CSV</h3>
<p>We want to add a quick way of sharing MongoDB data with others. While initially we planning to add basic import/exports support, later we plan to more deeply integrate with MongoDB tools.</p>
<h3>7. Better GridFS support</h3>
<p>While we think that GridFS is not the feature that is used by most MongoDB users, but we still plan to implement fast files view with abilities to create, edit and delete files.</p>

<h3>Background </h3>
<p>Established by a group of young social activists in 2012, REFORM is an independent, secular, non-partisan Palestinian NGO that strives for a society where everyone has the capacity to participate effectively, individual and collective rights are respected, and pluralism is ensured in an independent Palestinian state. REFORM adopts a strategy of sustainably empowering marginalized groups, in particular youth and women from hard-to-reach communities, through establishing safe acting platforms, encouraging community-led development processes and shaping a more inclusive governing system that is responsive to people's needs. </p>
<h3>Why is this project important?</h3>
<p>The Hub functions as a creative and interactive platform for various groups of Palestinian society, including students, young entrepreneurs, and women and youth from marginalized areas. Members, friends, and visitors, along with anyone who is curious about the Hub, can use this socio-cultural space to share and exchange ideas during facilitated discussions with participants, which provides them with the opportunity to network with like-minded people. Users of the Innovation Hub can use the premises to receive professional support from the community and experts from all over to become inspired for new and unconventional approaches in order to bring their ideas to life.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>What will your contribution help to achieve?</span></p>
<p>Your contribution will not only support the current Innovation Hub but also develop our vision to up-scale and develop a new and more complex Innovation Hub with a greater spatial area capable of facilitating a number of activities at the same time, such as: vocational training, cinema club, book club, performances, exhibitions, workshops, dance classes, lectures, independent work, study hall, etc. This safe environment is to be open to all components of the community.</p>

<p>I'm  the
mother of a little girl who has Downs Syndrome, Autism and associated learning difficulties. When I had my daughter Shari I had no understanding about the characteristics of children with special needs but I was determined to learn and to help her achieve her potential.  This is how I accidentally developed the Pocket Learner.  I started to explore the system and found that she grasped it with both hands.  Now, at the age of 8 she is able to identify pictures and words and although she still has difficulty forming sentences, she has an amazing vocabulary and can read several hundred written words.</p>

<p>The Pocket Learner is being developed under the auspices of ACT Training Services, a not-for-profit organisation based in London, whose remit includes the empowerment of people living in deprived communities.  The organisation runs short accredited and bespoke training programmes enabling its trainees to develop skills and competencies in order to secure sustainable employment.  Andrea Campbell co-founded ACT in 2006 and along with Richmond Tyser they serve as directors of the company through which they continue to provide services to the local community.</p>

</div></div>","Summary The Pocket Learner presents an easy and simplistic method for promoting language development - vocabulary building and literacy in children, especially those who have learning difficulties or who are developmentally delayed.


I'm  the
mother of a little girl who has Downs Syndrome, Autism and associated learning difficulties. When I had my daughter Shari I had no understanding about the characteristics of children with special needs but I was determined to learn and to help her achieve her potential.  This is how I accidentally developed the Pocket Learner.  I started to explore the system and found that she grasped it with both hands.  Now, at the age of 8 she is able to identify pictures and words and although she still has difficulty forming sentences, she has an amazing vocabulary and can read several hundred written words.



We are really keen to share the fun, satisfaction and sense of achievement we enjoy with our daughter.  We are aware that there are many families who are struggling to help their children and are seeking a way that will enable them to do so.  The Pocket Learner system will provide that medium and I am confident that you will find it to be one of the most effective systems available for empowering your children.  I believed that my child could do more; surely your child can too!
The Pocket Learner is being developed under the auspices of ACT Training Services, a not-for-profit organisation based in London, whose remit includes the empowerment of people living in deprived communities.  The organisation runs short accredited and bespoke training programmes enabling its trainees to develop skills and competencies in order to secure sustainable employment.  Andrea Campbell co-founded ACT in 2006 and along with Richmond Tyser they serve as directors of the company through which they continue to provide services to the local community.


How
it works


The Pocket Learner uses a system of words, images and transparent pockets to encourage participation and the concept can be extended to a range of uses including the promotion of early numerical skills as well as foreign language development.  It is initially tutor-led (by parents, carers or teachers) and then self-directed by the child if possible. 


Several focus groups and practice sessions were conducted with parents and children in order to observe the impact of the Pocket Learner on their educational development.  What we observed was very encouraging and this propelled us to develop the system without delay.


What We Need & What You Get
The aim is to widen access to education for children who
struggle in their early years.  This includes not only children with learning difficulties but children who are starting to read and who are keen to build their vocabulary. 
We have already spent money on building the foundation - designing and producing the prototype, intellectual property, testing and remodeling. We are now looking for a further £28,000 to fine-tune the
product and fund the first production run.  We would like to obtain samples for promotion to the relevant community organisations, government institutions and commercial entities.
Those who support our campaign will receive the limited edition set including an attractive carry box.  The materials are environmentally friendly.  Depending on your level of funding you will also receive a set of Pocket Learner numeracy cards for those children who are at the stage where they are focusing on developing competency in the use of numbers.

Achievements Thus Far 

The Pocket Learner - the book with no words - was conceived approximately two years ago and during that time the project has grown leaps and bounds.  The cover artwork was commissioned and the workbook was designed; a rudimentary prototype was developed and manufactured and in October 2014 the Pocket Learner was accepted for exhibition at the British Invention Show and Awards. The concept won a British Invention Silver Medal, a Global Women Inventors and Innovators (GWIIN) Special Recognition award and a GWIIN certificate of recognition.
During the period we were also able to design a logo and secure the relevant intellectual property registrations.

                                                       
British Invention Silver Medal                               GWIIN Special Recognition Award

We believe that
introducing the Pocket Learner to the world via a crowdfunding platform will
offer a unique opportunity to access those individuals who:
i)  have been through my journey and can understand the importance of developing such a system in order to support children with learning difficulties;
ii)  might have a child who
could benefit from the product;
iii) 
know of a child who
would benefit from the system and
iv) 
have a passion to
support children who are disadvantaged in terms of their learning ability.

This is the latest prototype of the Pocket Learner.  There are still a few improvements to be made .

      


For your contributions we will send you complete sets of the pocket learner - the final product which will consist of an attractive carry box, a workbook and two sets of cards - images and words.  
We have a reasonable funding target and are conducting a fixed funding campaign. Should we be unable to reach our funding goal contributors will bear no risk as no funds will be transferred to us.  If unsuccessful we have a number of options we could consider including i) re-running the campaign and ii) seeking angel funding. We are however, keen to secure the required funds via this crowdfunding campaign and are committed to honouring every perk we promise within the time-frame indicated.   



The Impact
   It is quite an amazing
experience to see how quickly children grasp the concept and start to read. It
appeals equally to both boys and girls and its flexibility encourages parents
and teachers to be creative.
The benefits of the system
are as follows:

· 
It inspires children to learn 
· 
It encourages collaboration

There is no need to buy an expensive electronic device 
· 
Children learn the fundamentals in a fun way
· 
The programme doubles as a game with several children or
with adult and child
·   The system is easy to use 
· 
It teaches through play-based learning
· 
It requires no prior knowledge (but helps if the child has a basic knowledge of phonics)
· 
The system has been designed to make children comfortable
with learning and develops their problem solving skills
· 
The inbuilt prompting system ensures that children are not
discouraged when they cannot work out the answer – the answers appear in a fun way.




What People Say


As the father of a child with special learning needs, I believe that the Pocket Learner is a successful balance of the ""fun"" and ""structure"" required to help her learn. It will help children, particularly those with learning difficulties to acquire the vocabulary they need to begin reading and improve communication.
I look forward to the pleasure of passing on those special family reading treasures in the not too distant future so she can share even more with us.  Dr Michael Bruce, Cognitive Psychologist

As educational professionals who are determined to ensure every child achieves his/her potential, we are constantly seeking high quality resources to support each child's learning.  I believe the Pocket Learner is a tool that will enhance reading skills and contribute to vocabulary building.  Marva Rollins, Headteacher
Brilliant and much needed concept to help all children improve their literacy. A practical and tried and tested solution from an inspirational mother, a great product for all children. Very inspiring, simple, clear and will change the future for many children.  H Memon, Publisher - Shade 7
The Pocket Learner looks like an innovative product which will be very useful to parents, especially those who have children with disabilities. D. Leadette, Ex-School Governor and Mother of Three
I have worked 1-to-1 with lots of kids with Down’s Syndrome. There is a real lack of useful educational interactive tools. This is great and specifically targets the abilities of these fantastic children finally.  Jenny Davie, Special Education Teacher & Inventor
I think you found IT!  Simply what the world has been waiting for but not looking for.  This product speaks every language and speaks for itself.  Release it! Peter Olorunnisomo - Poet, Writer, Playwright 


Stretch Goals



The objective of this
campaign is to produce the first materials (i.e. the workbooks, the first sets
of cards and the carrier boxes.  However,
the range of potential usage is wide and in the event that we exceed the target
we will be looking to produce the next sets of cards (based on different subjects). 
  
There are 5 additional products under consideration - activity sequencing cards, a nursery resource, a card game, labels and a computer application.  Any excess on our target will enable us to produce higher volumes of the workbook and be able
to introduce the Pocket Learner to a wider audience.  In addition we will be able to produce a prototype of the next product - the much anticipated activity sequencing cards. We are social entrepreneurs committed to promoting social development focusing particularly on the welfare of disabled children.  In this regard ACT works in partnership with Camptys Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation which supports the work of frontline agencies engaged in the education and welfare of disabled children living in deprived communities across the globe. 



Risks & Challenges
 
We've spent the last year
designing and developing the Pocket Learner. Over the period the system has
been tested by parent groups, pre-school and primary school children.  It has input from primary school teaching
professionals.  


As we are running a fixed funding campaign, if we fall short of our goal the funds will not be taken and we will endeavour to run a second campaign.  This removes the element of risk to our supporters.  In order to keep our manufacturing costs to a minimum we are required to produce a reasonable volume to enable us to offer our supporters good value for their contributions.

Other Ways You Can Help
 We appreciate any support we can get. People
can support the Pocket Learner in many ways including spreading the word. Please tell your friends, your work colleagues, family, as
many people as you can. You can also share this campaign through social
media and use the share tools provided here on Indiegogo. 
Please, help us extend the reach of the Pocket Learner and help a child to aspire higher.
We take the opportunity to thank you for taking the time to read our crowdfunding
page and look forward to your kind support as we embark on a journey to impact the lives of those who need it most.

<p><strong>The modern map of stars</strong> in the  3d space with our Sun in the center - you pictured the <strong>Starmap Light</strong>. </p>
<p>The map is in a 1 cm to 1 light year scale, so it gives an incredible insight to the vast distances of our galaxy. The stars seem to be only inches away at the scale, but the nearest black hole or the galactic center is hundreds of meters in the distance -<i> as indicated on the map.</i></p>
<p>We all have a goal in the universe - and it is to be home in it ! </p>
<p><strong><i>(For the list of objects and stars displayed, see below !)</i></strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520423198/drvj0i1dbof8ap1trvel.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Greetings ! </strong>We are a small group of enthusiasts in Finland, who believe in enriching life trough interesting, inspiring and informative projects and tools with personal touch.</p>
<p>This project is specifically close to our heart since its conception. Its a project of passion, not a business by any means. It is small and simple and yet it is huge in many ways. After the initial design phase and brainstorming, we came up with a good solution and trustworthy partners to make it real in a  relatively short time - with supporters who share the enthusiasm.</p>
<p><strong>[<i>For more info about the how the campaign works, technical solutions and production, and a <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Astronomy/comments/9om8g6/map_of_the_nearby_stars_in_3d_space_final_version/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">discussion</a> see the last section !</i>]</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Starmap Light</strong> lays on a 20 cm diameter round glossy plastic base which features the galactic map itself. The base contains the main electronics and contols.</p>
<p>In the galactic map printed on the top our Sun is positioned in the center and all it's neighbor stars are accurately placed around it on a 1 cm to 1 light year scale. The directions to the most interesting and significant locations in the deep space, like our galactic center or the nearest black hole, are indicated on the map, along with their relative distance.</p>
<p>The stars are dispersed, white glass orbs which come in 3 different sizes to represent theireal life dimensions relative to each other. The support rods have fiber optic light tubes inside, leading the light above from base.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541719876/hxkwpbm7udf9o1ckdke7.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong><i>Dual light system</i>: </strong>Pure white and real star emission color - achieved trough individually addressable LED bulbs in the base. <i>With a push of a button your stars will switch from pure white shine to their real emission color !</i></p>
<p><b>The map</b> presents all the stars within a 10 light year radius (around  29 stars - See the star chart below).</p>
<p><strong>Light modes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Pure white</strong> (The stars shine uniformly in warm white color) </p>
<p style=""margin-top:-15px;""><strong>- Star emission</strong> (The stars shine in their real emission color)</p>
<div style=""margin:15px;background:#ffffe5;padding:10px;font-size:15px;"">
<p><i> <strong>Additional modes</strong> ( What these modes lack in realism, they make up for it in fun)</i></p>
<p><strong>- Fade</strong> (The stars light up and fade in random order in a slow, rhythmical pattern for relaxation and sleep - single and multi-color mode)</p>
<p style=""margin-top:-15px;""><strong>- Relative brightness</strong> (Each star glows with different brightness representing its luminosity) </p>
<p style=""margin-top:-15px;""><strong>- Distance</strong> (The stars light up rhythmically in the order of their distance )</p>
<p><strong><i>Game mode:</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>- Know your neighborhood</strong> (Guessing game)</p>
<p style=""margin-top:-15px;"">(We will offer a guessing game delivered by updates to the mobile app (<i>See below!</i>) with a single or multiplayer mode, in which you have to guess the star in question by tapping on the virtual map. The map itself will respond with  appropriate colors and light patterns! <strong>Also, when a random star lights up, you could guess its type, temperature and distance by its position and color !</strong>)</p>
</div>
<p style=""margin-top:-15px;""> </p>

<p style=""margin-top:-15px;"">With enough support<sup>*</sup> we will offer an accompanying free <i><strong>mobile app  which serves as a control hub for every light related function</strong></i> - <strong>like </strong><i><strong>activating individual stars or star groups, filtering the lit up stars by type, temperature or distance</strong> </i>and other features.</p>

<p><strong>So how many stars then ?</strong></p>
<p>Ultimately it depends on you ! The package will arrive with the base and the stars separated, and you can set up as many as you like and enjoy as they light up ! You can change the look and feel of your map every day! Or - if you wish - you can just leave the base empty and admire the map itself lit in the dark.</p>

<p style=""font-size:10px;margin-top:-10px;""><i>Square prototype without the stars showing only the map</i></p>
<p><strong>The base and the stars come separate</strong> - the goal by this design is to make it your own by placing the stars yourself, learning their name and type along the line and have a lot of great fun. The individual stars will have different sizes and colors, representing their size and type in the real life! The solution is based on LED and fiber cable technology.</p>

<p>The star map is covering a 10+ light year radius with our Sun in the center. Every star has a colorful and informative description in the instruction manual, and is colored and scaled appropriate to its type and size. </p>
<p><b>But you can peek over the radius of the map - the directions to the most significant locations are indicated on the map along with their distances at scale. </b>The Proxima Centauri (the closest star to us) is only 4 centimeters away, but you will need to walk dozens of meters to the nearest black hole - these proportions will give you a better sense of the actual distances in our local stellar neighborhood ! </p>

<p><strong>Timeline, schedule and how to track the progress  </strong></p>
</div><p>In addition to the updates here, we created a <a href=""https://www.codesignprojects.com/starmap"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">webpage</a> as well to follow and track the progress of the project. The updates will come at a regular weekly schedule , and even more , they will be informative and sharing a lot of fine details (such as samples of blueprints and summaries of design changes).</p><p><strong>Planned schedule:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Campaign starts </li>
<li>Campaign period and successful conclusion - day 0</li>
<li>Finishing the technical details and (electronic parts) CAD designs - day 20</li>
<li>Concluding the negotiations with the producing partners and finalizing the finished product, packaging, instruction manual and more - day 50</li>
<li> Mass production first wave concludes and products are ready to ship - day 90</li>
<li><i><strong>Sending out our products to the backers and supporters - day 91 !</strong></i></li>
</ul><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520525887/k0fxtlregskzulqfwbl3.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Some thoughts on production and cost. </strong>First, this is an exclusive product. We came up with the idea, made research, created 3D designs and blueprints and will engage many local workshops for a small scale production. The key here is local and small scale. We only produce for our campaign supporters (if the campaign is successful), so you will have a truly unique and exclusive product to call your own ! The prices are - off course - determined by the production method and scale. We insist on local workshops to ensure quality, and by the nature of crowdfunding campaigns, cannot guarantee large scale orders. Think about it as a partly handcrafted item, with many manual and independent design elements in the production - and take pride in owning one ! </p><p>[<strong>Technical details and multi colored light system</strong>] Since the stars are separate from the base (concept) we decided that the led should be in the base circuit board and fiber optic cables inside rigid light tubes (or coated acrylic) lead the light up trough the bars to the white glass orbs (Our prototypes show that the light is bright enough and has a good angle of visibility). The bars are slide-in (or possibly magnetic). We have decided to go with only one version, which incorporates the dual light system - <strong>the stars can shine in pure white color or in their real life star emission color by a push of a button ! </strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541059321/oeqn2tgdxbaolwykeqwa.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3><strong>Answers about the campaign, Indiegogo and funding (Update)</strong></h3><p><strong>We got a lot of questions</strong> since the campaign kicked of, and realized that the world of crowdfunding is as new to many as it was to us ! So we have decided to give you some clarification and update on the process !</p><p><strong>We decided to set the goal to fixed</strong>, meaning that the campaign is only successful if the set amount is raised. We are confident about the set goal - it will provide the necessary resources to finalize the CAD designs, and secure the plastic mold, which are the most expensive parts of the operation.</p><p>(<i>Right now we estimate around ~120 backers needed</i> with the current method of production.)</p><p><strong>But we brainstorm constantly </strong>on more optimal methods, and it might make the project possible even with lower amount of fund raised (meaning lower number of individual items.) But anything under a certain threshold makes the project impossible (plastic manufacturing, PCB and others).</p><p>(In any case we will inform you after the campaign concluded about the result ! In the optimal case the campaign was successful and we will update you about the manufacturing and shipping dates ! )</p><p>If the campaign stays under the critical number of orders in a month from now, we will be 1. sad that this project couldn't see the day of light and 2. you will get a refund automatically.(trough Indiegogo - you might loose the transaction fee in this case !)</p><p>And one more thing - we don't ""lock"" your contributions. So any point in time you might change your mind and retract it ! We only want to be sure, that we can fund the workshops for manufacturing.</p><p><strong>Hope it helps !</strong> </p><p> </p><h3><strong>Some social media to reach us</strong></h3><p><a href=""https://www.codesignprojects.com/starmap"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Webpage</a></p><p><a href=""https://twitter.com/AnfieldJerrara"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/starmaplight/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/starmaplight/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/StarmapLight/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Reddit</a></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541059226/hqixdehoytwzbcqjtm6c.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>The Impact of your contribution</strong></h3><p>This is easy: without you we wont do it.

The modern map of stars in the  3d space with our Sun in the center - you pictured the Starmap Light. 
The map is in a 1 cm to 1 light year scale, so it gives an incredible insight to the vast distances of our galaxy. The stars seem to be only inches away at the scale, but the nearest black hole or the galactic center is hundreds of meters in the distance - as indicated on the map.
We all have a goal in the universe - and it is to be home in it ! 
(For the list of objects and stars displayed, see below !)

Greetings ! We are a small group of enthusiasts in Finland, who believe in enriching life trough interesting, inspiring and informative projects and tools with personal touch.
This project is specifically close to our heart since its conception. Its a project of passion, not a business by any means. It is small and simple and yet it is huge in many ways. After the initial design phase and brainstorming, we came up with a good solution and trustworthy partners to make it real in a  relatively short time - with supporters who share the enthusiasm.
[For more info about the how the campaign works, technical solutions and production, and a discussion see the last section !]

        
The Starmap Light lays on a 20 cm diameter round glossy plastic base which features the galactic map itself. The base contains the main electronics and contols.
In the galactic map printed on the top our Sun is positioned in the center and all it's neighbor stars are accurately placed around it on a 1 cm to 1 light year scale. The directions to the most interesting and significant locations in the deep space, like our galactic center or the nearest black hole, are indicated on the map, along with their relative distance.
The stars are dispersed, white glass orbs which come in 3 different sizes to represent theireal life dimensions relative to each other. The support rods have fiber optic light tubes inside, leading the light above from base.

Dual light system: Pure white and real star emission color - achieved trough individually addressable LED bulbs in the base. With a push of a button your stars will switch from pure white shine to their real emission color !
The map presents all the stars within a 10 light year radius (around  29 stars - See the star chart below).
Light modes:
- Pure white (The stars shine uniformly in warm white color) 
- Star emission (The stars shine in their real emission color)

 Additional modes ( What these modes lack in realism, they make up for it in fun)
- Fade (The stars light up and fade in random order in a slow, rhythmical pattern for relaxation and sleep - single and multi-color mode)
- Relative brightness (Each star glows with different brightness representing its luminosity) 
- Distance (The stars light up rhythmically in the order of their distance )
Game mode:
- Know your neighborhood (Guessing game)
(We will offer a guessing game delivered by updates to the mobile app (See below!) with a single or multiplayer mode, in which you have to guess the star in question by tapping on the virtual map. The map itself will respond with  appropriate colors and light patterns! Also, when a random star lights up, you could guess its type, temperature and distance by its position and color !)

 
Control hub and functions 
 
With enough support* we will offer an accompanying free mobile app  which serves as a control hub for every light related function - like activating individual stars or star groups, filtering the lit up stars by type, temperature or distance and other features.
 
* A certain amount of backers is needed for this functionality and hardware (This doesn't effect the current light system controls)

And shine all the stars
So how many stars then ?
Ultimately it depends on you ! The package will arrive with the base and the stars separated, and you can set up as many as you like and enjoy as they light up ! You can change the look and feel of your map every day! Or - if you wish - you can just leave the base empty and admire the map itself lit in the dark.

Square prototype without the stars showing only the map
The base and the stars come separate - the goal by this design is to make it your own by placing the stars yourself, learning their name and type along the line and have a lot of great fun. The individual stars will have different sizes and colors, representing their size and type in the real life! The solution is based on LED and fiber cable technology.

 
All the stars displayed within 10+ light years of radius, along with the distance and location of black holes, the galactic center, the nearby galaxies and more !


Some details of the map on a square prototype
Prototype with colored glass orbs (Depending on the level of support we might offer swappable star orbs with colors too)
 

The star map is covering a 10+ light year radius with our Sun in the center. Every star has a colorful and informative description in the instruction manual, and is colored and scaled appropriate to its type and size. 
But you can peek over the radius of the map - the directions to the most significant locations are indicated on the map along with their distances at scale. The Proxima Centauri (the closest star to us) is only 4 centimeters away, but you will need to walk dozens of meters to the nearest black hole - these proportions will give you a better sense of the actual distances in our local stellar neighborhood ! 
 
Galactic locations indicated on the map
(for list of stars, see below)
 


Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy (Closest known galaxy orbiting our Milky Way) - 250 m away from the Sun


Magellanic clouds (dwarf galaxies ) - 1790 m away from the Sun


Andromeda galaxy on collision course with the Milky Way- 25000 m away from the Sun


A0620-00 (V616 Monocerotis) - the nearest black hole - 33 m away from the Sun

Galactic center (Supermassive black hole - Sagittarius A)- 250 m away from the Sun

Direction of the galactic movement of our solar system (towards Vega)

​The map comes with a string with a centimeter scale, so measuring distances between stars and converting them to real light year units is a breeze and a fun.

Timeline, schedule and how to track the progress  
In addition to the updates here, we created a webpage as well to follow and track the progress of the project. The updates will come at a regular weekly schedule , and even more , they will be informative and sharing a lot of fine details (such as samples of blueprints and summaries of design changes).Planned schedule:
Campaign starts 
Campaign period and successful conclusion - day 0
Finishing the technical details and (electronic parts) CAD designs - day 20
Concluding the negotiations with the producing partners and finalizing the finished product, packaging, instruction manual and more - day 50
 Mass production first wave concludes and products are ready to ship - day 90
Sending out our products to the backers and supporters - day 91 !
 Some thoughts on production and cost. First, this is an exclusive product. We came up with the idea, made research, created 3D designs and blueprints and will engage many local workshops for a small scale production. The key here is local and small scale. We only produce for our campaign supporters (if the campaign is successful), so you will have a truly unique and exclusive product to call your own ! The prices are - off course - determined by the production method and scale. We insist on local workshops to ensure quality, and by the nature of crowdfunding campaigns, cannot guarantee large scale orders. Think about it as a partly handcrafted item, with many manual and independent design elements in the production - and take pride in owning one ! [Technical details and multi colored light system] Since the stars are separate from the base (concept) we decided that the led should be in the base circuit board and fiber optic cables inside rigid light tubes (or coated acrylic) lead the light up trough the bars to the white glass orbs (Our prototypes show that the light is bright enough and has a good angle of visibility). The bars are slide-in (or possibly magnetic). We have decided to go with only one version, which incorporates the dual light system - the stars can shine in pure white color or in their real life star emission color by a push of a button ! Answers about the campaign, Indiegogo and funding (Update)We got a lot of questions since the campaign kicked of, and realized that the world of crowdfunding is as new to many as it was to us ! So we have decided to give you some clarification and update on the process !We decided to set the goal to fixed, meaning that the campaign is only successful if the set amount is raised. We are confident about the set goal - it will provide the necessary resources to finalize the CAD designs, and secure the plastic mold, which are the most expensive parts of the operation.(Right now we estimate around ~120 backers needed with the current method of production.)But we brainstorm constantly on more optimal methods, and it might make the project possible even with lower amount of fund raised (meaning lower number of individual items.) But anything under a certain threshold makes the project impossible (plastic manufacturing, PCB and others).(In any case we will inform you after the campaign concluded about the result ! In the optimal case the campaign was successful and we will update you about the manufacturing and shipping dates ! )If the campaign stays under the critical number of orders in a month from now, we will be 1. sad that this project couldn't see the day of light and 2. you will get a refund automatically.(trough Indiegogo - you might loose the transaction fee in this case !)And one more thing - we don't ""lock"" your contributions. So any point in time you might change your mind and retract it ! We only want to be sure, that we can fund the workshops for manufacturing.Hope it helps !  Some social media to reach usWebpageTwitterInstagramFacebookReddit  The Impact of your contributionThis is easy: without you we wont do it. With you we Will. Period. We really hope that you like the product and the idea behind it, we trust that it gives you the same sense of awe and inspiration as it gave us - and will help to pave the way for more science and space design products and other cool gadgets. We believe that this product is worth it. We didn't hire  a marketing team, we didn't start an advertising campaign. It is strictly between us, here and only here.  It depends on You. Thank you !
 
 
And that's all there is to it.    Contact and support: codesignprojects@outlook.com ----FAQWhen will if i get mine ?As soon as the campaign concluded succesfully, we will star the manufacturing process and the estimated delivery to you is  2-3 month, with 3 month being the maximum planned. Is the postage included in the perks ?Yes, it is - when you choose a perk the final price will include post added to the product cost. Although there might be hidden additional costs, like custom fees, which are different for every region and country. Generally, the postage included covers the cost of the shipping.",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

I'm raising money by offering work and holiday accommodation so I can raise the deposit to buy an investment property.  One of my favourite things to do is to do things for other people so best part of my project is that for every 10 weeks of holiday accommodation you book, I will give a family with a sick child a weeks accommodation for FREE! Also if you don't want to come to the Gold Coast but still want to support my quest, you can purchase a weeks accommodation and donate it back to me and I will allocate that week to a charity to use within their organisation. I am so excited!I'm not seeking charity (although all donations are appreciated!). Because my house will be located on the Gold Coast I am offering holiday accommodation in it for up to 70 weeks to help raise the money for the deposit plus I'm ready and willing to do other jobs to make my dream a reality.Once the holiday accommodations have been completed the house will be rented out to someone who needs a place. If you're interested in booking a weeks holiday (or longer) on the Gold Coast then let me help!So why do I want a house?I've been reading for some time that a house is a good investment, and decided that investing in one is what I need to do, but I also kept hearing that its getting hard for young people to invest and get ahead. If I wait until I save the money up from working it will take me many years to raise a deposit.The longer I take the more expensive houses will become and the longer it will take me to raise the money...in fact after expenses, taxes and increasing prices it might take me 20 years to buy one!     I talked to Mum and Dad and after lots of discussion they set me a challenge...""you come up with the deposit and we will guarantee the other 90%""...so there it was..my challenge. I just had to come up with a way to find the rest.I didnt want to give up on my dream...so I came up with the idea...why not offer holiday accommodation in my new house to raise the money for the deposit I had to find... then buy the house with the proceeds advanced by people staying? When I was told about crowdfunding I knew it was the way to do it!What I Need & What You GetI have 90% of the fund secured as a loan but I need to raise $48000 to cover the deposit and make my wish come true. I have already saved just over $4000 of my deposit from different jobs I have doneMum and Dad have helped me do my sums. I can afford to buy a 3 bedroom house that sells for around $400000. Allowing for stamp duty, property costs, legal fees  Indiegogo costs, and furniture and cutlery for the house (so you have something to sleep on and eat with!) I will need an extra $23000. I can borrow around $375000 so that leaves me about $48000 to raise.I've come up with a series of rewards that I hope you will like  :-)
One weeks accommodation in the house once I've bought it so you can enjoy a holiday on the Gold Coast (rates will vary depending on when you book it)
Upgrade your weeks stay with a guided tour of the Gold Coast where I will show you the sights!
I will come and work for you for an hour, several hours or a day (packing, cleaning, helping you in your business or around the house)
If you're visiting the Gold Coast but dont want to stay for a week how about a homestay? You can book a nights accommodation in my family home and I'll even cook you dinner as well!

<p>I (Adesina Kehinde Olumuyiwa) am a passionate teacher and an Author with a vision to touch the future by impacting at least one child in every community of Nigeria through teaching and/or creative writing and publishing of Educational books. As a graduate of Biology Education from a reputable university in Nigeria. I have developed great passion for quality Education at all levels. I believe the right to quality education can not be taken away from children. It is what all child have no matter his/her gender, race, colour, religion, social status or financial level of parents.</p>
<p>Have'n been a Teacher in Secondary School for 10years now, I have found out ; I have that the gap between the education of the poor and the elites is extremely wide. This education inequality will not foster Faster National development, peace and unity. In a system where the Educational system and its cost favours the privileged few neglecting many who are poor, National unity cannot be achieved. The quality of education provided for children in the rural area and in the slum where we have the Low income earners especially at the Nursery and Primary level is extremely poor and cannot foster all-round development of a child.  </p>
<p>My ideology<br/>Fact has revealed that 1 out of every 5 primary school dropouts in the world is a Nigerian. When a child miss out of pre-primary education, they are less likely to read, less likely to count and less likely to finish secondary school. The impact of dropping out of school is thus long lasting.  Pre-primary and primary education of every child should thus be put into serious consideration if we must have the future leaders we dream to leave behind at the end of our days. This is why I advocate for quality Basic Education for all irrespective of Race, Social status, financial capability, Background or Religion.<br/>In my volunteering experiences ranging from LEAP Africa/Cities iLEAD project, LEAP Africa/British Council Fast forward project, LEAP Africa Lead the way project and others, where I have been involved in effecting change projects in the schools and communities around the schools where I was posted, has further exposed me to the poor educational system of most rural areas and has increase my passion for provision of quality education at all levels. </p>
<ul><li>Briefly describe your campaign and why it's important to you.</li></ul>
<p>This campaign is one that I am passionate about. Its stem from the manance of Educational inequalities brought about by a system of Educational funding which favours the privileged few at the expense of many who are poor or less privileged. Children of the rural areas and slums ate subjected to poor classrooms, poor learning infrastructures and low educational funding. In a place where quality basic education is available, the children of low income earners can not be afford such opportunity because of the high cost of the schools. It is therefore my desire to provide quality Montessori education at discounted prices and scholarship packages at rural areas and slums starting with my local Community. This is very important to me as it will gradually propel me towards achieving my vision of impacting at least one child in every community of Nigeria.</p>
<p>This campaign if adequately supported will not only bridge the gap of Educational inequalities and provide quality education at rural areas but will also assist the government in the provision of well equipped Basic education schools in the rural areas and slums. If blue print this project is followed sequentially and funding is made available, there will be a time when no child in the country will be without at least Basic education.</p>
</div><div>
<p>In order to start this project funding is needed to acquired an already identified property which is suitable for the preparatory, Nursery and primary school in the community of Eleidi Atala in Ota Ogun state. A total of 1.3 million naira is needed which will cater for the following as analysed below:</p>
<p>Property rantage - 350,000</p>
<p>White boards for classes (10psc) - 80,00 </p>
<p>Tables and chairs for classes- 200,000</p>
<p>Montessori teaching items - 80,000</p>
<p>Text books - 50,000</p>
<p>Desktop computer (5psc) - 150,000</p>
<p>Office printer- 25,000</p>
<p>Cabinets and bookshelf- 75,000</p>
<p>Training of teachers - 50,000</p>
<p>Video player and Flat screen TV (2ps)- 80,000</p>
<p>Painting Decoration of school walls and classes - 100,000</p>
<p>Generator - 50,000</p>
<p>Ceiling fans for office and classrooms - 50,000</p>
<p>Other teaching aids - 30,000</p>
<p>Notebooks and markers- 50,000</p>
<p>Miscellaneous - 80,000</p>
<p>Total- 1,500,00</p>
<p>This school will be unique in that it provides quality Montessori education which is not available at public schools and even most private schools who can not afford to run a Montessori school. It will provide this service at a discounted price to people and use the school to accommodate children of the less privileged who could be on full or partial scholarship. This project will also assist children who have dropped out of school due to financial challenges of their parents or due to loss of one of their parents.</p>
<p>However, if the target fund needed for this project is not achieved, the funs raised will be used to assist nearby schools to improve their teaching and learning infrastructure e.g donation of computer systems, renovation of classrooms, provision of Library stationaries e.t.c.</p>
</div><div>
<p>This project will be of huge impact as it will reduce the number of school dropout at the primary level and make quality education available to the rural children and the less privileged. It will assist the government to provide quality education at the grass root level.</p>
<p>I am so optimistic about this project because of my past achievement and involvement with various NGO's who focus on assisting to develope quality education in public and private schools. A notable example was the achievement of Fast forward project of LEAP Africa/Cities bank in which I was instrumental to providing internship placement for secondary school students in two different local government of Nigeria. Worthy of note also is the LEAP Africa/British Council iLEAD project in which I was instrumental to effecting different change projects in two different public secondary schools in Lagos Nigeria.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","I (Adesina Kehinde Olumuyiwa) am a passionate teacher and an Author with a vision to touch the future by impacting at least one child in every community of Nigeria through teaching and/or creative writing and publishing of Educational books. As a graduate of Biology Education from a reputable university in Nigeria. I have developed great passion for quality Education at all levels. I believe the right to quality education can not be taken away from children. It is what all child have no matter his/her gender, race, colour, religion, social status or financial level of parents.
Have'n been a Teacher in Secondary School for 10years now, I have found out ; I have that the gap between the education of the poor and the elites is extremely wide. This education inequality will not foster Faster National development, peace and unity. In a system where the Educational system and its cost favours the privileged few neglecting many who are poor, National unity cannot be achieved. The quality of education provided for children in the rural area and in the slum where we have the Low income earners especially at the Nursery and Primary level is extremely poor and cannot foster all-round development of a child.  
My ideologyFact has revealed that 1 out of every 5 primary school dropouts in the world is a Nigerian. When a child miss out of pre-primary education, they are less likely to read, less likely to count and less likely to finish secondary school. The impact of dropping out of school is thus long lasting.  Pre-primary and primary education of every child should thus be put into serious consideration if we must have the future leaders we dream to leave behind at the end of our days. This is why I advocate for quality Basic Education for all irrespective of Race, Social status, financial capability, Background or Religion.In my volunteering experiences ranging from LEAP Africa/Cities iLEAD project, LEAP Africa/British Council Fast forward project, LEAP Africa Lead the way project and others, where I have been involved in effecting change projects in the schools and communities around the schools where I was posted, has further exposed me to the poor educational system of most rural areas and has increase my passion for provision of quality education at all levels. 
Briefly describe your campaign and why it's important to you.
This campaign is one that I am passionate about. Its stem from the manance of Educational inequalities brought about by a system of Educational funding which favours the privileged few at the expense of many who are poor or less privileged. Children of the rural areas and slums ate subjected to poor classrooms, poor learning infrastructures and low educational funding. In a place where quality basic education is available, the children of low income earners can not be afford such opportunity because of the high cost of the schools. It is therefore my desire to provide quality Montessori education at discounted prices and scholarship packages at rural areas and slums starting with my local Community. This is very important to me as it will gradually propel me towards achieving my vision of impacting at least one child in every community of Nigeria.
This campaign if adequately supported will not only bridge the gap of Educational inequalities and provide quality education at rural areas but will also assist the government in the provision of well equipped Basic education schools in the rural areas and slums. If blue print this project is followed sequentially and funding is made available, there will be a time when no child in the country will be without at least Basic education.

In order to start this project funding is needed to acquired an already identified property which is suitable for the preparatory, Nursery and primary school in the community of Eleidi Atala in Ota Ogun state. A total of 1.3 million naira is needed which will cater for the following as analysed below:
Property rantage - 350,000
White boards for classes (10psc) - 80,00 
Tables and chairs for classes- 200,000
Montessori teaching items - 80,000
Text books - 50,000
Desktop computer (5psc) - 150,000
Office printer- 25,000
Cabinets and bookshelf- 75,000
Training of teachers - 50,000
Video player and Flat screen TV (2ps)- 80,000
Painting Decoration of school walls and classes - 100,000
Generator - 50,000
Ceiling fans for office and classrooms - 50,000
Other teaching aids - 30,000
Notebooks and markers- 50,000
Miscellaneous - 80,000
Total- 1,500,00
This school will be unique in that it provides quality Montessori education which is not available at public schools and even most private schools who can not afford to run a Montessori school. It will provide this service at a discounted price to people and use the school to accommodate children of the less privileged who could be on full or partial scholarship. This project will also assist children who have dropped out of school due to financial challenges of their parents or due to loss of one of their parents.
However, if the target fund needed for this project is not achieved, the funs raised will be used to assist nearby schools to improve their teaching and learning infrastructure e.g donation of computer systems, renovation of classrooms, provision of Library stationaries e.t.c.

This project will be of huge impact as it will reduce the number of school dropout at the primary level and make quality education available to the rural children and the less privileged. It will assist the government to provide quality education at the grass root level.
I am so optimistic about this project because of my past achievement and involvement with various NGO's who focus on assisting to develope quality education in public and private schools. A notable example was the achievement of Fast forward project of LEAP Africa/Cities bank in which I was instrumental to providing internship placement for secondary school students in two different local government of Nigeria. Worthy of note also is the LEAP Africa/British Council iLEAD project in which I was instrumental to effecting different change projects in two different public secondary schools in Lagos Nigeria.

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>Hi, I am Daniel. I worked for more than 20 years for the United Nations as Systems Architect and always had a great passion for software development and coding. I retired early not long ago and could now relax without having to work. Before I started working for the UN I developed a management system for a private school and since then it has been on my mind to do it again but this time with a much larger scope.</p>
<p>I am planning to build a software that is able to manage all aspects around the <strong>management of educational institutions</strong> - from primary schools to universities.</p>
<p>This software will be comprehensive in it’s functions and will contain modules for student management, finance, health, communication, attendance, library and more.</p>
<p>Further, to make this product <strong>stand out from similar products</strong> that are currently available on the market, there will be:<br/>- an integration of school management, learning platform and web conferencing<br/>- <strong>aggregation of data</strong>, which makes it interesting for groups of schools or for ministries of education of a city or state.</p>
<p><strong>Your gain</strong>: 7% of future yearly net profit will be distributed among donors. </p>
<p>Timeline: At the end of the fundraising campaign (September 2021) start of development. September 2022 initial roll-out of 50% of targeted functions and begin of marketing campaign. September 2023 deployment of finalized product.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>My two daughters are in private school and the system their school is using is a patchwork of different applications and systems. There is no proper billing system in place and the invoices are sent manually by an admin staff. Communications are usually sent twice with the same content – there is no concept of “family grouping” in their system. Absences are never notified – ideally they should be instantly. And I have reasons to doubt that the system is compliant with European GDPR regulations.</p>
<p>At the same time there are many applications that are available on the market and that are able to do certain things well, but are not comprehensive. Some are comprehensive but not intuitive, and others again are not designed for large amount of traffic. And most were not built e.g. with the visually impaired in mind.</p>
<p>These are just a few reasons that convince me that a newly designed and structured system has great potential.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<h3>Education.zone system</h3>
<p>The system will be build with functions that cover most aspects needed to manage a private or public school successfully. These include modules such as:</p>
<p>- Student administration (registration, enrollment, attendance, assignments, assessments, grading, class/timetable scheduling)<br/>- Finance<br/>- Health Records<br/>- Library<br/>- Housing<br/>- Reports and Analytics<br/>- Communication<br/>- Human Resources</p>
<p>The system will be offered as an online service and will be built for high traffic demands. Each module will be developed as a standalone service to be ready for future scalability and high availability.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Potential and what is in it for you</h3>
<p>The market is decisively big for such a product. There are competitors in this field but most software solutions in this area work for individual learning institutions. While Education.zone can also be used for single institutions, the aim is to offer this product as a solution for city, state or even national administrations as well as large school groups. As far as I know the only country who has successfully undertaken such a project as an e-government solution is Saudi Arabia (Noor software).</p>
<p>As an example a single region in India has approx. 900,000 primary and secondary schools, 8000 high-schools and colleges and 700 university. Imagine if the ministry of such a region would be able to detect where the schools with most student absences are, they could address the problem more efficiently. Or if they were able to see, based on crowd assessments, where the most talented children in the region are, then they could target these children with special education programs. Or if they at a glance would be able to see how the vaccination programs are being developed among children.</p>
<p>The plan is to roll-out the software during the first year in China, Russia, Ghana and Nepal, because of personal connections I have in these countries. There is also the possibility of collaboration with some of the United Nations agencies (e.g. school feeding project of WFP).</p>
<p>The goal is to have 1,000,000 registered children by the end of September 2024.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<h3>How your funds will be used</h3>
<p>The funding goal is 625,000 CHF plus fees (5% indiegogo, 2.9% bank transfer fees). This will cover the first 3 years and will be split into these parts:</p>
<p><strong>200,000</strong> <strong>CHF</strong> (Sept 2021-Sept 2024)<br/>This amount is divided in:<br/>- 120,000 CHF for myself (3,300/month). Even though I have a pension and do not need to work, the reason for this is that we live on a farm and if I dedicate my time on this project, I will need to hire workers to do the farming job.<br/>- 80,000 CHF for external developers, designers and quality/usability testers</p>
<p><strong>400,000 CHF</strong> (Sept 2022 – Sept 2024)<br/>Marketing. Besides having a strong web-presence, the goal is to initially start the campaign in 4 selected countries. </p>
<p><strong>25,000 CHF</strong> (Sept 2012 – Sept 2024)<br/>Legal fees</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The funding is fixed – the project will only start if funding is secured. The share for Marketing and Legal if requested, could be held on escrow account for 1 year until the marketing campaign starts.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Timeline</h3>
<p>The development will start at the end of the fundraising campaign.</p>
<p>Sept 2021 – Sept 2022<br/>Development of 50% of targeted modules.</p>
<p>Sept 2022 – Sept 2023<br/>Development of rest of targeted modules.<br/>Start of marketing campaign in selected countries.</p>
<p>Sept 2023 – Sept 2024<br/>System improvements and bug fixing.<br/>Continue with marketing campaign.</p>
<p>Sept 2024 -&gt;<br/>Either more external funds will be needed for marketing, or the project will be able to sustain itself at that point.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>It’s a product and there is always the risks that it cannot be sold. A lot will depend on a good marketing strategy. For the product itself, I do guarantee that the system will be user friendly, stable and fast. I have over 25 years of experience in software development and on request, I’ll be glad to provide references.</p>
<p>The biggest risk is, if something would happen to me before the product is released. For this case I would sign an agreement to make sure that my wife would return all unused funds to the donors (in proportion to the donated amount).</p>

<p><strong>~ REIMAGINING &amp; REVOLUTIONIZING EDUCATIONAL DELIVERY ~</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>With the Information Age hurriedly falling away behind us, we experience more and more areas where Artificial Intelligence (AI) has replaced and obsoleted concepts, careers, educational and service provision across all sectors of the globe. The need to know has been satisfied and the knowledge market is oversaturated due to the influx of knowledge at our fingertips through the internet and smart technologies. The unique need which has emerged from this, is acquiring the ability to harness useful knowledge and put it to work for us. What is the use of knowledge, if it does not propel one to reaching their highest potential, achieving success in both worlds, and strengthening ones spiritual, mental, and physical aptitude? Knowledge is beneficial when it leads to productive actions, as it is a means to achieving ones’ goal, not the goal itself. </p>
<p>Traditional educational institutes require students to acquire large percentages of useless knowledge that they often never revisit again beyond the classroom. This colossal waste of time is actually a money minting scheme. LIGHTHOUSE ACADEMIA GROUP has reimagined and revolutionized acquisition and delivery of education by rethinking on the effectiveness of its current delivery vs a more practical based educational delivery platform which benefits students by allowing them to acquire relevant knowledge which augments their lives both physically and spiritually. </p>
<p>The foundational mainstay of the LIGHTHOUSE ACADEMIA GROUP’S Philosophy and ideology is  to deliver useful knowledge which affects productive actions leading to the achievement of goals which are beneficial resulting in individuals living their lives to the fullest, with the most dynamic and healthiest approach. </p>
<p>LIGHTHOUSE ACADEMIA GROUP offers a unique and trailblazing approach to acquiring knowledge by combining three means of knowledge acquisition in a dynamic amalgamation, setting it apart from educational institutions as we know them. Our visionary founders have moved forward into the future from the Information Age to the Connected Age by creating a dynamic educational delivery platform in which useful information can be harnessed and leveraged using smart and technologically advanced networks. LIGHTHOUSE ACADEMIA GROUP ensures that students will spend equal amounts of time in self-study, studying with a professor and a direct acquisition through experience and involvement. This will be delivered through vast national and international networking as part of each of our educational programs. National and international study tours, virtual tours and tutoring, professional shadowing, appointed cybernetic academic advisors and professional mentors globally based, hands on training and deliberate networking are the strategies which will be implemented to provide students with a direct acquisition of knowledge and sets us apart. </p>

<h3>And the Rest is History...</h3>
<p>Lighthouse Academia Group, Inc., successfully purchased an historical building in Charlotte Court House, VA, the prior J. Murray Jeffress Elementary School, built in 1952 for African Americans during segregation. As an African American, female-owned business, the purchase of the Jeffress school building provides Lighthouse Academia Group the ability to preserve a piece of African American heritage in the area while giving back quality education inclusive of all, in a diverse and welcome school environment. The once “Coloured” school, as is mentioned on the original blueprint, will now be renovated to deliver useful knowledge in an inclusive environment. Renovation of the Jeffress School building into a new center of learning, provides continuity of history for a community dedicated to educating the 21st century-ready student. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You can be instrumental in securing your place on the right side of history in the making by contributing to this cause and spreading the word. Funding will be spent on building smart, inclusive educational institutions which cater to the unique needs of diverse students, in a revolutionary and reimaged way. We are creating a dynamic educational delivery platform in which useful information can be harnessed and leveraged using smart and technologically advanced networks. Every dollar collected will go towards this project; it is up to you to determine how quickly we achieve the goal. </p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Real Challenges</h3>
<p>According to the US Federal Reserve’s Report to the Congress on the Availability of Credit to Small Businesses, more than 53% of African-American owned businesses are denied bank financing, a rate more than twice as high as white counterparts. When African Americans do receive approval for bank funding they are denied the full amount requested. Additionally, the state of affairs has so negatively impacted the African American entrepreneur that credit is only sought 25% of the time even when needed to sustain a business. </p>
<p>Systemic racism historically affects the ability of Black-owned businesses to secure large loan amounts even when fully qualified. If you are reading this, you can change the outcomes with your support for this endeavor. </p>
<p>Additionally, gender discrimination of female business owners continues to permeate throughout all industries. We intend to overcome these challenges by reaching out to the silent majority, who believe in equality and justice for all, and support innovative and progressive change. </p>

LIGHTHOUSE ACADEMIA GROUP offers a unique and trailblazing approach to acquiring knowledge by combining three means of knowledge acquisition in a dynamic amalgamation, setting it apart from educational institutions as we know them. Our visionary founders have moved forward into the future from the Information Age to the Connected Age by creating a dynamic educational delivery platform in which useful information can be harnessed and leveraged using smart and technologically advanced networks. LIGHTHOUSE ACADEMIA GROUP ensures that students will spend equal amounts of time in self-study, studying with a professor and a direct acquisition through experience and involvement. This will be delivered through vast national and international networking as part of each of our educational programs. National and international study tours, virtual tours and tutoring, professional shadowing, appointed cybernetic academic advisors and professional mentors globally based, hands on training and deliberate networking are the strategies which will be implemented to provide students with a direct acquisition of knowledge and sets us apart. 
 
 

And the Rest is History...
Lighthouse Academia Group, Inc., successfully purchased an historical building in Charlotte Court House, VA, the prior J. Murray Jeffress Elementary School, built in 1952 for African Americans during segregation. As an African American, female-owned business, the purchase of the Jeffress school building provides Lighthouse Academia Group the ability to preserve a piece of African American heritage in the area while giving back quality education inclusive of all, in a diverse and welcome school environment. The once “Coloured” school, as is mentioned on the original blueprint, will now be renovated to deliver useful knowledge in an inclusive environment. Renovation of the Jeffress School building into a new center of learning, provides continuity of history for a community dedicated to educating the 21st century-ready student. 


The Impact
You can be instrumental in securing your place on the right side of history in the making by contributing to this cause and spreading the word. Funding will be spent on building smart, inclusive educational institutions which cater to the unique needs of diverse students, in a revolutionary and reimaged way. We are creating a dynamic educational delivery platform in which useful information can be harnessed and leveraged using smart and technologically advanced networks. Every dollar collected will go towards this project; it is up to you to determine how quickly we achieve the goal. 

 

Real Challenges
According to the US Federal Reserve’s Report to the Congress on the Availability of Credit to Small Businesses, more than 53% of African-American owned businesses are denied bank financing, a rate more than twice as high as white counterparts. When African Americans do receive approval for bank funding they are denied the full amount requested. Additionally, the state of affairs has so negatively impacted the African American entrepreneur that credit is only sought 25% of the time even when needed to sustain a business. 
Systemic racism historically affects the ability of Black-owned businesses to secure large loan amounts even when fully qualified. If you are reading this, you can change the outcomes with your support for this endeavor. 
Additionally, gender discrimination of female business owners continues to permeate throughout all industries. We intend to overcome these challenges by reaching out to the silent majority, who believe in equality and justice for all, and support innovative and progressive change.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><u><strong>Radio King Academy</strong></u></h2>
<p>RKO Academy is our community arts school.  It was set up to provide opportunities for individuals within local communities who share the immense passion for the art of music and broadcast media (radio production) as we do here at RKO. What we believe we are doing in effect is bridging the growing gap between the entertainment industry and the people. We designed a course that is flexible and designed to meet the needs of people of various ages and radio interest levels. Our courses are integral in helping build up participants with their confidence in recognising their passions and progressively pursuing careers in their chosen fields.</p>
<p>Reaching our crowd funder target means we can offer up to 10 schools our services by the end of 2018;  positively affecting the lives of up to 250 young people. </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We aim to raise £10000 for Radio King Academy, this will go towards tutor costs, digital broadcast equipment and administrative materials such as memory sticks, Whiteboards and notepads that can be used in our practical and theory based sessions. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Being locked down during COVID made me realize how much kids have shifted their attention to social media and games. This shift is reducing the ability to focus and be patient, which I observed in my kids. </p>
<p>As a project to actively bring back thinking and reasoning among kids, we embarked on the journey of creating Beyond Math led by my daughter Jasmine Uboma, a statistics undergraduate, class of 2025. Jasmine enjoys math and her passion is to bring the love of math and reasoning to other kids. Jasmine is the founder and CEO of Beyond Math. She is 17 years old and believes she can connect with kids through learning, having volunteered in many community outlets such as The E2 Young Engineers and Hockey games. She loves to organize activities for elementary kids which include hosting birthday parties, leadership and entrepreneurship conferences. She has a great connection working with school kids and they simply just love her. Beyond Math will be a platform where she will actively engage and share her passion and charisma with kids while learning analytical reasoning.</p>
<p>Beyond Math is co-authored by Jasmine Uboma, Jamike Uboma and Nnenna Uboma. </p>
<p>Beyond Math aims to teach kids the analytical reasoning technique to problem solve.</p>
<p>Practicing the exercises in this workbook will help a child develop </p>
<p>----math solving techniques </p>
<p>----analytical and critical thinking</p>
<p>----creativity and resilience</p>
<p>----strategic and active learning </p>
<p>----complex problem solving and reasoning </p>
<p>skills required to thrive in the ever-changing complex society we live in. </p>
<p>Analytical thinking is rated the #1 skill for future jobs. One gap that exists today is that the math taught in schools is based on repetitive formulas carried over the years, eliminating the adaptation to the advancement in digital occurrences more aligned to us today.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Beyond Math aims to go above the math formulas and bridge the gap of reasoning and out-of-the-box thinking as the value add required in today's workplace.</p>
<p>Beyond Math uses basic mathematical rules: multiplication, division, addition and subtraction to build links and roots between numbers.</p>
<p>Unraveling the hidden gaps has become an essential skill as we move more into the digitally automated black box machines. Beyond Math teaches the unravelling of hidden links between random sets of numbers through observation and reasoning  skills for complex problem solving.</p>
<p>Jasmine's strategic plan for Beyond Math is to develop an entrepreneurial no-fee franchise for her peers targeting undergraduate students enabling early entrepreneurship and community engagement. My role is simply being a mother, helping Jasmine to  win. I'm Nnenna Uboma, a mother of three and an analytics professional.</p>
<p>Please support Jasmine by making her an entrepreneur at 17 years old through backing her project of $5000. It is either she meets the target or loose all. With these funds, Jasmine is able to enrich her peers through entrepreneurial franchising as well as nurturing a generation of problem solvers and innovators.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk associated with this project is low as the publishing and printing costs are available. The funds are required to create marketing campaigns and build the Learning Management System for the tutoring series and franchising. The funds will make it possible for Jasmine to have the ability to enable Beyond Math reach many school aged kids so that together we can build a generation of Innovators and problem solvers</p>

UNICEF said some schools are in ruins and others have been shut because of safety concerns. <br/>Elsby said the situation is also bleak in government-controlled areas, where 187 educational institutions have been damaged or destroyed.<br/>“There are limited opportunities for displaced children to be integrated into the education system in host communities elsewhere in Ukraine,"" she said. Some parents, she added, are not registering their children in schools ""as they expect further displacement or intend to return home.”<br/>UNICEF said it is critical for children to go to school, especially in the midst of a crisis. It said school provides children with stability and structure, which helps alleviate the trauma of living in conflict zones.</span></span><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>","INTRODUCTION We represent a Village in Southern Ukraine, only 70 kilometers from occupied Crimea, Kozachi Laheri.

This money will go to assist directly to families been affected by the war, where children are involved. We assist bringing help directly to the families, and provide help with food, housing and medical help where needed. 
Kozachka Varta has helped the society with projects  form cleaning village to food programs and clothes to army. Latest project was to repair roads leading into the village. A project which was shown on national TV channels. Kozachka Varta consists of people engaged for a long period of time, with encouragement through their willpower to help others despite their own problems due to the conflict. If we do not reach our final goal with the funding, the amount will go to Kozachka Varta regardless, as we are of the opinion that any amount will help them.
We will announce all contributors on our website (kozachi.com) and also plans to make a contributors list in the village where the organisation has its head quarters.    The Impact About your campaign and how the difference their contribution will make:  We want to help Ukrainian children where they are, it is most cost effective and also the most effective in order to avoid cultural challenges.
Thousands of children are in need for food, clothes, medical help, school assistance and housing in Kherson region alone. Your contribution will matter and be felt almost immediately.
Kozachka Varta has in several projects collected money for food, clothes and infrastructure projects, and all projects have been successful. More about these projects can bee seen on the web site www.kozahi.com
 Projects based on this money will be announced on our web site www.kozachi.com as well as sought press attention in national media to ensure knowledge about the money spent according to our intentions.    Risks & Challenges  We will openly tell how much money has been spent on various projects helping Ukrainian children displaced in Ukraine, and their families. We will openly tell it in news media, on our web site, and press releases to be made by the organisation.
Our people has and will have contact with other organisations working on voluntarily basis to ensure funds are used as efficient as possible.   Other Ways You Can Help If you feel you want to help, but can't contribute financially, does not mean YOU can't help us:  Get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Use the Indiegogo share tools!   We hope for your help to help the displaced children of Ukraine, and want to make a reference made by UNICEF“We are very concerned that children are paying the highest price in this growing crisis in Ukraine,"" Elsby said. ""Damaged infrastructure, water shortages and hampered access to medical facilities in the areas of ongoing fighting are putting children’s lives at risk. ...""Children are also at risk of communicable diseases due to the lack of hygiene supplies, medicines and vaccines in conflict-affected areas. ... Exposure to the violent fighting and shelling is affecting their psychological well-being.”New data show that with 147 schools closed because of the fighting, some 50,000 children in parts of Donetsk have not been going to classes since September. UNICEF said some schools are in ruins and others have been shut because of safety concerns. Elsby said the situation is also bleak in government-controlled areas, where 187 educational institutions have been damaged or destroyed.“There are limited opportunities for displaced children to be integrated into the education system in host communities elsewhere in Ukraine,"" she said. Some parents, she added, are not registering their children in schools ""as they expect further displacement or intend to return home.”UNICEF said it is critical for children to go to school, especially in the midst of a crisis. It said school provides children with stability and structure, which helps alleviate the trauma of living in conflict zones.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Syria's Forgotten Refugees.

Most people don't know that there are African Christian minorities trapped in the middle of a sectarian civil war in Syria. 
 Our Sudanese Refugee Families fled Darfur & South Sudan to escape persecution and ethnic cleansing at the hands of the Janjaweed.  They fled to Damascus for safety only to find themselves in the middle of the Syrian civil war.  They are trapped in a war zone but you can help us to rescue them and bring them to Canada.    We Need Your Help to Sponsor Our First Family. Canadian law allows for Community Groups and ""Groups of Five"" Private Citizens to sponsor UN-approved Refugees to come start a new life in Canada with Permanent Residency.   We plan to bring 20 families to Canada over Fiscal Year 2015-2016.  We need your help to launch our #LegalAid Beyond Borders™ project so that we can manage the operation from Damascus to Vancouver ourselves and maintain program integrity.
We are selecting the first African family in Syria to be sponsored by a Vancouver ""Group of Five"" patrons.
Our #LegalAid Beyond Borders™ project will advocate for the family to ensure that they receive UN-certification and legal status in Syria during the process.
We will handle the legal caseworking for Canadian immigration sponsorship in-house and pro-bono in order to keep the costs down.
Once the first family arrives in Vancouver, we will fund their housing & health insurance for one year in order to help them get established.
Our philosophy of Ethical Migration means that we will fund the family privately so that they do not need to take public benefits from the Canadian authorities.

Every dollar/pound/euro helps us get closer to bringing the first family to Canada so whether we reach our goal or not, we are proceeding with the sponsorship by faith.     Rescue a Family.

<p>My name is Bruno Poggi, I am a University professor.</p>
<p>I teach Political Communication in a small private University of Rome, the UNINT (International University of Rome).</p>

<p>The level of education often isn’t high: inferior quality of education is a social scandal and can also be a personal tragedy.</p>
<p>With the initiative of the Pareto University, through e-learning, all these barriers collapse:</p>
<ol>
<li style=""margin-left:36pt;"">      it’s affordable (the annual fee varies from 170 to 399 USD for year, that is on average 90% less that a normal university);</li>
<li style=""margin-left:36pt;"">      it’s accessible (the student has a smartphone or a tablet);</li>
<li style=""margin-left:36pt;"">      it’s high quality because the are international teachers who come from all the world.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s a University without borders, without limits of space and time, it’s opened 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</p>
<p>The Pareto University is a stable reality: it offers four courses (Economics, Journalism, Tourism and Computer Engineering) and one master in Tourism. There are 20 teachers, over 200 lessons available (Subtitled in English or French),  and one library with more 1000 books.</p>
<p>We have the necessity to grow and to reach many young Africans and we need your help.</p>
<p>Make a donation and become a Supportive partner of the Pareto University.</p>
<p>With 100 USD you can help us to buy a tablet to donate to our students who can't afford one, and help them to study.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494597911/usjnbcmgbyqfbbmnszka.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Furthermore you can also donate for a scholarship (or to have one of the building of our virtual Campus composed by 14 buildings) named after you.</p>
<p>Because if many give even a little, we can do a lot.</p>
<p>If you agree with our way of thinking:</p>
<p>“We are reasonable, we want just the impossible. We change the world”.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal of the campaign is to reach 50.000 dollars.</p>
<p>This sum could be use to enroll many African students, to purchase tablets that the students can use to follow the courses and to take exams, to ensure access to the  Internet, to set up study rooms in the Pareto Points.</p>
<p>The Pareto Points are spaces with Internet connection, set by Private, Public or Religious institutions, where students can socialize, study, attend classes and take exams through E-learning.</p>

<p>To understand the economic weight, just think what it would mean for an European to pay a fee of fifty thousand euros a year.</p>
<p> Consequence: In Africa, only one percent of the population is graduated.</p>

<p><strong>The difference. </strong>What are the factors that makes Pareto University different from the other Universities?</p>
<p>First of all, it is economically affordable: One year costs from 170 to 399 dollars -  equal to three months of average income and not thirty, as it has always been – and can be attended from all,  at any time of day and night, 365 days a year, just by connecting to the University site. Furthermore, free application allows you to follow the lessons with a smartphone: being the lessons recorded, even working students can attend classes.</p>

<p><strong>For the women. </strong>The most discriminated in access to education are women, for both religious and cultural reasons.

<p><strong>The regularity of the exams. </strong>Unlike traditional online universities, where examinations take place physically, Pareto University only allows online exams.

<p><strong>Solidarity scholarship. </strong>An interesting topic for companies, but also for private individuals: anyone, investing around  200 dollars and believing in the project of a real and concrete education, can donate a scholarship and dedicate it to the memory of one's own dear person or a cause that he or she deems important. In order to help and give hope for better education to those who dream of studying, the university guarantees the lenders by sending them the contacts and the generalities of the students who will receive of the scholarship.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary

My name is Bruno Poggi, I am a University professor.
I teach Political Communication in a small private University of Rome, the UNINT (International University of Rome).
I have written two books of political essaies.
Last year I founded, with others colleagues, the Pareto University.
This is without any doubt the most important and fascinating project of my life.

It's a real chance to change the world and to offer the opportunity to have a better future to thousands of young Africans .

All over the world and especially in Africa there still are many barriers for young Africans to access higher education.

There are economic barriers: the average cost to enroll in one African country is the equivalent of 50.000 USD for an American citizen.

There are geographical barriers: large distances and limited mobility makes it hard to attend university for those who don't live in the city.

Women face cultural, economic and social barriers ( usually in African families, if there is a chance to access higher education for just one member, it is given to a boy rather than a girl).

The level of education often isn’t high: inferior quality of education is a social scandal and can also be a personal tragedy.
With the initiative of the Pareto University, through e-learning, all these barriers collapse:

      it’s affordable (the annual fee varies from 170 to 399 USD for year, that is on average 90% less that a normal university);
      it’s accessible (the student has a smartphone or a tablet);
      it’s high quality because the are international teachers who come from all the world.

It’s a University without borders, without limits of space and time, it’s opened 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
The Pareto University is a stable reality: it offers four courses (Economics, Journalism, Tourism and Computer Engineering) and one master in Tourism. There are 20 teachers, over 200 lessons available (Subtitled in English or French),  and one library with more 1000 books.
We have the necessity to grow and to reach many young Africans and we need your help.
Make a donation and become a Supportive partner of the Pareto University.
With 100 USD you can help us to buy a tablet to donate to our students who can't afford one, and help them to study.

Furthermore you can also donate for a scholarship (or to have one of the building of our virtual Campus composed by 14 buildings) named after you.
Because if many give even a little, we can do a lot.
If you agree with our way of thinking:
“We are reasonable, we want just the impossible. We change the world”.

 
What We Need & What You Get
The goal of the campaign is to reach 50.000 dollars.
This sum could be use to enroll many African students, to purchase tablets that the students can use to follow the courses and to take exams, to ensure access to the  Internet, to set up study rooms in the Pareto Points.
The Pareto Points are spaces with Internet connection, set by Private, Public or Religious institutions, where students can socialize, study, attend classes and take exams through E-learning.
As a thanksgiving for your help:
      5 dollars: letter of thanksgiving by the CEO of the Pareto University.

      10 dollars: letter of thanksgiving by the CEO and the Rector of the Pareto University.

      20 dollars: letter of thanksgiving by the CEO, the Rector and the Teachers of the Pareto University.
 

      25 dollars: a Supporting Partner Diploma.

      50  dollars: Honorary Diploma.

      100 dollars: have your name on a tablet donation (this tablet is donated by...) and a letter of thanksgiving with student photo with the tablet donated with dedication.

        200 dollars: scholarship dedicated to a special person ( for example in memory of...) to a student from: Benin, Burkina Faso, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia,  Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone or Somalia. The donors will have a photo portrait, of themselves or a special person, in the Hall of Fame of the Virtual  Campus and a letter of thanksgiving by the beneficiary student.

      400 dollars: a scholarship dedicated to a special person (in memory of…),  to a student from Cameroon, Cape Verde, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Senegal or Togo. Otherwise, two scholarships for two students  of  Benin, Burkina Faso, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone or Somalia. The contributors are going to have a photo portrait, of themselves or a special person, in the Hall of Fame of the Virtual  Campus and a letter of thanksgiving by the beneficiary/ies student/students.

The Campus of the Pareto University is composed by 14 Virtual buildings.
Each building has an economic value.
The first donor, based on the sum associated at Virtual building, can choose to dedicate the building to a special person for one year and can also have a permanent photo portrait in the Hall of Fame and a certificate, valid for one year, attesting the title of the building.

Below, the buildings of the virtual campus and the corresponding economic value:

      Market Store: 500 dollars;
      Sport Center: 600 dollars;
      Student’s Pub: 700 dollars;
      Reception Office: 800 dollars;
      Cinema/Theater: 900 dollars;
      Student’s Association: 1.000 dollars;
      Library:  1.200 dollars;
      Hall of Fame: 1.500 dollars;
      Museum: 1.750 dollars;
      Great Hall: 2.000 dollars;
      Teacher’s Office: 2.250 dollars;
      Congress Center: 2.500 dollars;
      Class Room: 2.750 dollars;
      Rectorate: 3.000 dollars.

 

 
If we don't achieve the goal of 50.000 dollars, the amount raised will still be used to increase the number of young Africans enrolled at the Pareto University, through scholarship awards and, as far as the amount will let it, the purchase of tablets for the most needy students.


 
The Impact
This project is very important for you and for the whole world.
It’s very important for you, because you will be the main actor of a historical revolution for the African education system: The first real online University, fully accredited and acknowledged, economical, affordable, of high quality and with international teachers.
Important to the world, because finally all the barriers that will prevent university access to young Africans will be torn down.

With Pareto University, economic, territorial, social, cultural and gender barriers will fall.
Pareto is an online university that is affordable for young Africans in poor countries.

It’s economically accessible, the title of study is already recognized in eighteen African countries, that is  about 440 million people, almost the European population, net of the Great Britain and with the decisive factor being that half the potential basin is under 18 years old.
Degrees, as well as masters, have the same quality system of European titles study, the European Qualifications Framework.
For residents of many African countries, enrolling at a University can be very difficult and extremely expensive: It’s a figure close to about thirty months of an average salary.

To understand the economic weight, just think what it would mean for an European to pay a fee of fifty thousand euros a year.
 Consequence: In Africa, only one percent of the population is graduated.
Help Africa in Africa. Increasing the level of preparation of African boys and girls means giving them career opportunities and therefore having fewer people forced to flee from their home, fewer men and women willing to put themselves into the hands of criminals in the hope of a better life.

To act on causes not effects.  The goal of the Pareto University is to bring in Africa a European level of education, affordable to all with teachers who come from four continents.
The ruling class currently is composed by a privileged class, privileged sons, that graduated abroad.
We believe that besides being a right for every human being, education is the factor that determines the destinies of a young man or a young woman and therefore of a whole country.

The difference. What are the factors that makes Pareto University different from the other Universities?
First of all, it is economically affordable: One year costs from 170 to 399 dollars -  equal to three months of average income and not thirty, as it has always been – and can be attended from all,  at any time of day and night, 365 days a year, just by connecting to the University site. Furthermore, free application allows you to follow the lessons with a smartphone: being the lessons recorded, even working students can attend classes.

For the women. The most discriminated in access to education are women, for both religious and cultural reasons. If you have five children, families are going to let the males study, there are no exceptions to this. Thanks to this project many women will have access to university education, even in secret.

Prospects for foreign companies. Increasing the level of education also means creating new markets for foreign companies.

The regularity of the exams. Unlike traditional online universities, where examinations take place physically, Pareto University only allows online exams. This is possible thanks to a software similar to the airports software, that recognizes the student identity through a webcam, along with other control systems. This is another feature that makes the Pareto system unique.

Recognized titles. Currently there are on-line courses in economics, journalism, engineering and computer science, with recognized degree in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameron, Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Togo. Other courses in preparation are: psychology, tourism and interpreting. The headquarter is in Malta, a member country of the EU. Consequently, degrees and masters are evaluated according European Qualifications Framework, the quality system of European degrees.

Solidarity scholarship. An interesting topic for companies, but also for private individuals: anyone, investing around  200 dollars and believing in the project of a real and concrete education, can donate a scholarship and dedicate it to the memory of one's own dear person or a cause that he or she deems important. In order to help and give hope for better education to those who dream of studying, the university guarantees the lenders by sending them the contacts and the generalities of the students who will receive of the scholarship.

This initiative has already attracted the attention of some Italian media as demonstrated by the following links:
http://www.repubblica.it/solidarieta/cooperazione/2017/03/15/news/africa-160624669/
http://www.faccecaso.com/2017/03/17/universita-online-africa-studenti/ 
http://www.tag24.it/175437-lafrica-e-online-grazie-alla-pareto-university/
Thanks to this project many young Africans can realize their dream of getting a degree and thus start working in the world with greater security and awareness of their abilities.
Through the teaching method implemented by Pareto University, thanks to internationally trained teachers, many young graduates, with equated and accredited qualifications, will be able to develop their professional skills directly in Africa, thus helping it to grow.

For example, they will be able to start their business, to provide their professional skills to other companies interested in investing in Africa, or simply to look for a high skilled job.

 
Risks & Challenges
The obstacles and the solutions that the project may encounter are listed below:
Problem: Don’t have the political support of African governments.
Solution: Pareto University has already reached agreements with 18 African States, it is a consolidated reality.



Problem: The scholarships of Africans may not be recognized out of the continent.
Solution: Pareto University is headquartered in Malta, a member of the European Union, so the Degrees and the Master are evaluated according to the European Qualifications Framework.

Problem: Contributors may not have confidence in how their money will be used.
Solution: Pareto University guarantees the contributors by sending them the general information and contact details of the scholarship and the student who will benefit from it.

Problem: Exams may not be regular.
Solution: Pareto University controls online exams through a software that recognizes students' identity through a webcam, together with other control systems.

Problem: Some families may deny access to online university education to women.
Solution: Thanks to scholarships, 365 days a year access to Online University and thanks to Pareto Point, they can study, even in secret.

Problem: Young people are working and they can’t attend lessons.
Solution: A free application from Pareto University allows you to follow lessons with your smartphone as well. The University is open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, and lessons are registered, giving the opportunity to attend the Degree courses also for working students.

<h3>Can you live forever with perfect mind and body?</h3>
<p>The causes of ageing are slowly being identified by scientists across the world.

<p><strong>Radical life extension</strong> is about turning back the clock. To having the body and mind you had in your 20s. We’re seeing the last generation of frail centenarians – they will soon be transformed allowing them to enjoy more time with their family and learn and experience more about the world. And that world, in return, will benefit from their decades of knowledge and skill that no longer needs to be lost back to dust.</p>

<h3>This is the next generation in developing applications and you can be a part of it!!</h3><h3>
<br/>
What this is not:</h3>
<p>It cannot (and should not) replace html. Html(or current web) is great in showing documents and sharing knowledge in a well-structured layout. <br/>
It is not designed to run perfectly on systems which do not support at least Open GL(ES).</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>About the creator</h1>
<p>I’m a senior software developer. But programming is not only my profession it’s also my hobby. So you could also call me nerd or crack. :-) </p><p>Anyway I studied economical IT in Deggendorf what I finished in 2004. I already wrote my diploma about 3D graphics programming, which was my passion since I got my first programming lessons. Though I already started writing first programs much earlier in Basic for the C64 home computer and during grammar school I wrote Pascal programs.</p>
<p>After my studies I was hired by PIXEL GmbH to build the first (real) 3D navigation system for a famous german car company. Followed by 3D medical software and another navigation system software. In my 10 years of development I was involved in projects for the following companies: SiemensVDO, BMW, Continental, Siemens MED, IBC Solar, Pixel GmbH, E.Solutions GmbH, Audi, VW, Porsche, ...</p><p>In my spare time I wrote the german book Direct3D Realtime Rendering für Computerspiele. As I was not married at that time I wrote the book with my maiden name Theuerjahr(I was born Ulrich Theuerjahr). When I married I took over my wife’s lastname(Beckert). We have 3 kids now. You can see them in the video and image gallery.</p>
<p>The book was sold out fast with mixed reviews: <a href=""http://www.amazon.de/Direct3D-Realtime-Rendering-Computerspiele-Programmierung/dp/3000223401"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.amazon.de/Direct3D-Realtime-Renderin...</a> </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1247761/files/20150225034411-EinbandSoft.jpg?1424864651"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>It included at that time(2007) just upcoming rendering techniques like deferred shading, HDR Lighting, volumetric fog (with the help of volumetric textures introduced with DirectX9), relief mapping or depth-of-field. I’m highly skilled in shader programming in Assembler and HLSL.</p>
<p>As I started at low level hardware at that time, I know what the current mobile systems are capable of, as the hardware is comparable. Making it easy for me to scale the solutions to all kinds of GPUs.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Why you can trust me and my campaign:</h3><div>There are frequent updates posted on facebook, the project homepage, twitter and my development site. If you contribute in buying the perk 'alpha and beta' or higher.</div><div>You will be invited to my development site. Where even more updates and more 'internal' updates will be posted. Like all finalized concepts, my detailed milestone plan. Including completion rate of milestone etc. There will always be visible progress!</div><br/>
<p> </p>
<h1>What you give and what you get</h1>
<p><br/>
Your contribution runs completely into the development process. Mainly paying the developers daily bread. As I have a wife and 3 kids it’s not so easy.  :-)</p>
<p>The calculation goes like this: 3500 Euros gross per month for me as the main developer. This is really the lower limit for a senior developer in Germany! <br/>I also need some money to pay other people for helping me with design, modeling, sound(for the games). Or to at least buy models and soundpacks or to license music tracks. I need also some extra money for hardware and software licenses. That means I <strong>need approx. 50000 Euros per year</strong>. </p>
<p>To be able to deliver this software I plan to need about <strong>2 years of development time</strong>. Which is a real optimistic guess.</p>
<p>That’s<strong> a total of 100000 Euros net</strong>. Now I have to add the german VAT my company has to pay for the indiegogo money. That’s another 19% leading to 119000 Euros. And about 10% Indiegogo and Payment fees, leading to a result of 130900 Euros. (Actually this calculation is wrong because I need to pay taxes and the fees for the total of 131072 Euros. So besides the fees there will only 94371 euros remain.)</p>
<p>As I’m a bit a nerd, I rounded it to the next power of 2. <strong>That’s the 131072 Euros</strong></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1247733/files/20150225033224-pie.png?1424863944"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<h2>What is already done/available</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The <b>Software Architecture is already really far</b>, at least for the graphics part.

<p><br/>
To keep good <b>code quality</b> I try to follow the<b> clean code</b> rules and try to work with <b>interface abstraction</b> as much as possible. I also use lots of design patterns.

<p>As version control system I use subversion(hosted externally).</p>
<p>I also plan to add a Jenkins server for continuous integration when I'm ready to compile for some platforms. See the milestones below.</p>

<h2>What needs to be done</h2>
<p>Of course there is still a lot to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementation of the Graphics Interfaces with OpenGL and OpenGL ES and later DirectX 11/12(DX9 already done) and Vulkan.</li>
<li>Implementation of the OS Interfaces for Linux/Unix Systems including MacOS iOS and Android at first. Followed by SailfishOS, FreeBSD(PS4 OS is based on this one), QNX, WindowsPhone...</li>
<li>Implementation of Input and Sound Interfaces. Will be done via SDL library.</li>
<li>Implementation of Physics Interfaces. Will be done with bullet.</li>
<li>Implementation of UI controls.</li>
<li>Implementation of a Text Engine.</li>
<li>Implementation of Hardware access. Using libusb and others(StreamInput)</li>
<li>Implementation of resource streaming and resource uploader with libcurl.</li>
<li>Implementation of Resource Compiler and compressor(lzop).</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
 </p>
<p>Here is an overview of the currently planned Milestones:</p>
<p> </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1280073/files/20150309021137-milestones.gif?1425892297"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<h1>Risks &amp; Challenges</h1>
<p><br/>As of any project, there are a lot of risks here, too.</p>
<p>First and probably the worst case is, <b>I could die</b>. For that case, I will have a second person who is capable of either continuing development(with the rest of the money) or at least release the sources as open source to the public. So that anyone else could finalize this project.</p>
<p>Second I could get sick or something similar what can <b>delay</b> the project. In this case I cannot fullfill the timeline. A delay also means that in the end <b>I could run out of money</b>. Therefore it would be essential to reach and if possible exceed the main goal.</p>
<p>Another risk is, that the <b>targets</b> I try to support <b>change</b>. E.g. that Google drops OpenGL ES support from Android or Microsoft drops DirectX and switches to the Mantle API. Though the probability for this cases to happen is extremely low.</p>
<p>Then it can happen that <b>I forgot some issues</b> which are hard to solve, or e.g. to get a hard- to-find deadlock when using some library. These things could also lead to greater delays.</p>
<p><b>Libraries I use could drop support for future platforms</b>. When E.g. SDL would not support android 5. I then need to implement it on my own leading also to an unplanned delay.</p>
<p>Another risk is <b>security</b>. Some people could offer a package where they add malicous code to one of the dlls. To counter this, I plan to add a checksum on each binary package which the launcher checks before execution. And I plan to make the executables hosted centrally on my server. That way it's easier to maintain and upgrade. And Developers don't have to upload or publish the binaries. They only need to set the version they developed on. But this can be added automatically by our compiler.</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p><h3>Challenges</h3><br/>
Developing for different input scenarios and screen resolutions is one big challenge.<p></p>
<p>Developing/Compiling for different operating systems is not that easy,too.<br/>Heavy tasks:<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Getting or setting up a toolchain including devices with the different OSes. <br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Setting up a build server.</span></p>
<p>And last but not least making a safe xml reading of user code is really a heavy task.<br/>
There needs to be a kind of whitelist for tags. there could be problems with case-sensitivity, with text encoding, internationalization...</p>
<p>There are still a few questions/ideas open.</p>
<p>But I personally love challenges, I think that is what makes life great.</p>

<h1>Other ways to help</h1>
<p><br/>
If you are not able to contribute to this project in a monetary way, you can also help in another way, by simply <b>telling your friends and relatives about it!</b></p>
<p>You can use the Indiegogo tool to easily share this project.<br/>Please have a look at <a href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/527376-How-to-Share-A-Campaign-With-Others"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/527376-How-to-Share-A-Campaign-With-Others</a></p>
<p>So help me and all the people out there to climb Web 4.0, the Native Web!</p>
<p><br/></p><p></p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Why XML?</h3><p><b>Here are the reasons:</b></p><p></p><ul>
<li>Html is also XML. And people/developers know this already. </li>
<li>I needed a way to script cross-platform. </li>
<li>Any simple text editor can be used. </li>
<li>Tools(to output XML) can be written easily by everyone.</li>
<li> XML is the de-facto standard description/interchange language.</li>
</ul><p></p><h3>Differences between the native web technology and a game engine? </h3><ul>
<li>Though the engines can deploy to a lot of platforms it is up to the developer what will be supported. With Native Web(NW) it will definitely run on all supported platforms out of the box! Though sometimes some adaption needs to be done by the developer for the best experience.</li>
<li>NW has easier distribution. Time from buying to play is really short.</li>
<li>NW uses easy out of the box licensing.</li>
<li>NW is not only used for games. It can also be used for any other purpose.</li>

Have you ever dreamt about feature rich, fast webpages and high performance web applications which also can fully work offline? Or have you ever programed a software you would now like to see on other platforms or devices?
Developed simply by writing some text in a text editor, the same way as html?Creating virtual 3D homepages like virtual supermarkets or your own virtual castle as 'walkable' homepage, where the user can virtually explore your home. Developing apps/games that run out-of-the box on Playstation, Raspberry PI, Smartphones, Tablets and Desktops.
Then this is just the top of this 'iceberg'/project. The possibilities are endless.
This project offers you the possibilities to:

build Apps that run out-of-the-box on nearly any operating system


build applications that run mostly the same way on all devices.



build performance Apps with full hardware accelerated graphics


build Apps with incredibly easy distribution(just copy your package to your server)
write your apps in not more than xml
build AAA 3D or 2D games started by any browser or with a desktop shortcut
use physics -> build 2D 3D UIs with physics, like bouncing buttons...,

write your embedded system UI and logic in XML and use it on cheap/free OSes
use all underlying hardware like sensors, special input or output devices(e.g. VR headsets Vive, Rift, Morpheus or GearVR)...
build games that let mobile phone users play against desktop or playstation users.
all binaries will be free of charge(as well as all used file formats). 

This is the next generation in developing applications and you can be a part of it!!

What this is not:
It cannot (and should not) replace html. Html(or current web) is great in showing documents and sharing knowledge in a well-structured layout. 
It is not designed to run perfectly on systems which do not support at least Open GL(ES).
 
About the creator
I’m a senior software developer. But programming is not only my profession it’s also my hobby. So you could also call me nerd or crack. :-) Anyway I studied economical IT in Deggendorf what I finished in 2004. I already wrote my diploma about 3D graphics programming, which was my passion since I got my first programming lessons. Though I already started writing first programs much earlier in Basic for the C64 home computer and during grammar school I wrote Pascal programs.
After my studies I was hired by PIXEL GmbH to build the first (real) 3D navigation system for a famous german car company. Followed by 3D medical software and another navigation system software. In my 10 years of development I was involved in projects for the following companies: SiemensVDO, BMW, Continental, Siemens MED, IBC Solar, Pixel GmbH, E.Solutions GmbH, Audi, VW, Porsche, ...In my spare time I wrote the german book Direct3D Realtime Rendering für Computerspiele. As I was not married at that time I wrote the book with my maiden name Theuerjahr(I was born Ulrich Theuerjahr). When I married I took over my wife’s lastname(Beckert). We have 3 kids now. You can see them in the video and image gallery.
The book was sold out fast with mixed reviews: http://www.amazon.de/Direct3D-Realtime-Renderin... It included at that time(2007) just upcoming rendering techniques like deferred shading, HDR Lighting, volumetric fog (with the help of volumetric textures introduced with DirectX9), relief mapping or depth-of-field. I’m highly skilled in shader programming in Assembler and HLSL.
As I started at low level hardware at that time, I know what the current mobile systems are capable of, as the hardware is comparable. Making it easy for me to scale the solutions to all kinds of GPUs.Why you can trust me and my campaign:There are frequent updates posted on facebook, the project homepage, twitter and my development site. If you contribute in buying the perk 'alpha and beta' or higher.You will be invited to my development site. Where even more updates and more 'internal' updates will be posted. Like all finalized concepts, my detailed milestone plan. Including completion rate of milestone etc. There will always be visible progress!
 
What you give and what you get

Your contribution runs completely into the development process. Mainly paying the developers daily bread. As I have a wife and 3 kids it’s not so easy.  :-)
The calculation goes like this: 3500 Euros gross per month for me as the main developer. This is really the lower limit for a senior developer in Germany! I also need some money to pay other people for helping me with design, modeling, sound(for the games). Or to at least buy models and soundpacks or to license music tracks. I need also some extra money for hardware and software licenses. That means I need approx. 50000 Euros per year. 
To be able to deliver this software I plan to need about 2 years of development time. Which is a real optimistic guess.
That’s a total of 100000 Euros net. Now I have to add the german VAT my company has to pay for the indiegogo money. That’s another 19% leading to 119000 Euros. And about 10% Indiegogo and Payment fees, leading to a result of 130900 Euros. (Actually this calculation is wrong because I need to pay taxes and the fees for the total of 131072 Euros. So besides the fees there will only 94371 euros remain.)
As I’m a bit a nerd, I rounded it to the next power of 2. That’s the 131072 Euros
Of course It’s needless to say that more would help me lowering the risks(see risks section below). That’s why I also take part in the Indiegogo InDemand program, if I am able to reach the main goal!
Even if I do not collect the desired amount, I will continue with this project as long as I can, because I think it is essential for anyone in the world, mainly the developers, to have real platform independence. Being independent of Google, Microsoft and Apple. Seeing great applications on any device.

What you get is the next evolutionary web technology before everyone else. It's a completely new way of developing applications. This is as innovative as C was when it came up after assembler. Reserve yourself a place in history books, by supporting this project(If you like, your name will be mentioned on the projects Wikipedia page). You can regard yourself as a pioneer, making a new technology useable for everyone. Get independent of all the big companies like Microsoft, Google or Apple who control the current web.I don’t want to control anything. I like to see innovative software which can be developed fast and easy. And which can be accessed by everyone. I don’t want to have one webpage/application for desktop users and another one(reduced) for smart phone users. The user experience should be the same on all devices.

My package gives developers an easy to use package to make great applications and easily distribute it to everyone by simply putting the package on a webserver. The developer has control whether it also works completely offline or not. For internal use, simply put it on your intranet server. 
Internationalization will be included out-of-the box. E.g. you are not allowed to write text in any xml tags. Text is added via a text tag with an ID. Then there must be a language xml file(it is recommended to name the file after the ISO 639-2 Codes) containing the texts matching this ID. You can then simply add another language by adding the filename to your xml languages array.

Depending on the perks you pay you can also be a part of the development process!
Discuss features with me in the development blog.
Get also any release including alpha and beta versions from the beginning.
Get detailed info about the development progress.

Here is a small overview of the different technologies: 

How it works
I will give you the SDK package containing binaries/executable for all the operating systems and platforms as well as a tool to distribute it. You add your(or edit the available)  resources including the main xml’s called universe(2d and 3d) as well as images/textures, 3d models, sound files etc. Here is an example of a universe 2d file. This is just a preliminary concept file:Then start the distribution tool. It compiles your resources (to compressed binary files for performance reasons) and uploads the package to a server of your choice.
In your website you simply add one line/tag with the path to that package. That’s all.
When now a user opens your homepage he will be offered to download/run your native web application. If he clicks OK, the binaries fitting to the users OS will be downloaded(if not done earlier) as well as the application content and the resources the developer has added directly to the start package. More content can then be streamed from somewhere else. This is completely under the developer’s control!
He can for example pack the first level and the main UI components into the start package and during the user playing level one download the resources for level 2. That guarantees low waiting times for the user to start with the application. Everything that is downloaded can then also be run offline.
If you prefer looking at images to understand it, here it is:
An example: How to write a simple 2d navigation appFirst, developers write the code like this universe2d xml(right-click and 'save content as'): http://nativeweb.roulio.com/navi.xml
Or here is a screenshot of it(open it in new tab for good quality): 

This is all you need to program!!! for a basic navigation app that shows a 2d map, allows free scrolling when activating the toggle button and which sets a destination on doubleclick and calculates the route. It also displays the time to destination. For details please look at the comments. Just 50 lines of code!!!
The universe2d file is part of the resources, so all you have to do for distribution is:- start my compiler/uploader tool.- Enter the ftp path of your server and your credentials.- click 'compile'. - When compilation went fine, click 'upload'.
That is all!!!When a user now browses to your server folder, no matter with which device or operating system(!), he/she will be offered to download your Native Web App.He/She will get the binaries fitting to his OS(if not done earlier) and your compiled resources.He/She then starts it like a normal app. This navigation app then runs on Windows PCs(GPS needed), Playstation 4(if there would be GPS?), Smartphones and Tablets out-of-the-box!! Without adapting input or screen resolution!
What is already done/available
 
The Software Architecture is already really far, at least for the graphics part. A first version exists(Windows DirectX 9) where a first cube is shown using already the completely new pipeline. The new model format, the universe approach and the rendertree with vertex and pixel shaders.
As well as a lot of base classes like special containers and 2d and 3d math classes. Including unit tests.
You can run that first application at http://nativeweb.roulio.com/?page_id=16
Here a screenshot;
 

To keep good code quality I try to follow the clean code rules and try to work with interface abstraction as much as possible. I also use lots of design patterns. If you have looked at the xml image above. You may have seen a prototype section. This is named after the prototype pattern. And in code it exactly follows that.As mentioned this architecture works already the desired way! 
As version control system I use subversion(hosted externally).
I also plan to add a Jenkins server for continuous integration when I'm ready to compile for some platforms. See the milestones below.
For the higher perk contributors, I also made a team site, where you can get the latest project infos. It also contains a project calendar, wiki, issue tracker, discussion board and a newsfeed. 
When I get your mailadress after paying your perk(perk ""Alpha and Beta access"" and higher), you will be invited to this site. 

 
What needs to be done
Of course there is still a lot to do:

Implementation of the Graphics Interfaces with OpenGL and OpenGL ES and later DirectX 11/12(DX9 already done) and Vulkan.
Implementation of the OS Interfaces for Linux/Unix Systems including MacOS iOS and Android at first. Followed by SailfishOS, FreeBSD(PS4 OS is based on this one), QNX, WindowsPhone...
Implementation of Input and Sound Interfaces. Will be done via SDL library.
Implementation of Physics Interfaces. Will be done with bullet.
Implementation of UI controls.
Implementation of a Text Engine.
Implementation of Hardware access. Using libusb and others(StreamInput)
Implementation of resource streaming and resource uploader with libcurl.
Implementation of Resource Compiler and compressor(lzop).


 
Here is an overview of the currently planned Milestones:
 
Risks & Challenges
As of any project, there are a lot of risks here, too.
First and probably the worst case is, I could die. For that case, I will have a second person who is capable of either continuing development(with the rest of the money) or at least release the sources as open source to the public. So that anyone else could finalize this project.
Second I could get sick or something similar what can delay the project. In this case I cannot fullfill the timeline. A delay also means that in the end I could run out of money. Therefore it would be essential to reach and if possible exceed the main goal.
Another risk is, that the targets I try to support change. E.g. that Google drops OpenGL ES support from Android or Microsoft drops DirectX and switches to the Mantle API. Though the probability for this cases to happen is extremely low.
Then it can happen that I forgot some issues which are hard to solve, or e.g. to get a hard- to-find deadlock when using some library. These things could also lead to greater delays.
Libraries I use could drop support for future platforms. When E.g. SDL would not support android 5. I then need to implement it on my own leading also to an unplanned delay.
Another risk is security. Some people could offer a package where they add malicous code to one of the dlls. To counter this, I plan to add a checksum on each binary package which the launcher checks before execution. And I plan to make the executables hosted centrally on my server. That way it's easier to maintain and upgrade. And Developers don't have to upload or publish the binaries. They only need to set the version they developed on. But this can be added automatically by our compiler.
Challenges
Developing for different input scenarios and screen resolutions is one big challenge.
Developing/Compiling for different operating systems is not that easy,too.Heavy tasks:Getting or setting up a toolchain including devices with the different OSes. Setting up a build server.
And last but not least making a safe xml reading of user code is really a heavy task.
There needs to be a kind of whitelist for tags. there could be problems with case-sensitivity, with text encoding, internationalization...
There are still a few questions/ideas open.
But I personally love challenges, I think that is what makes life great.
 
Other ways to help

If you are not able to contribute to this project in a monetary way, you can also help in another way, by simply telling your friends and relatives about it!
You can use the Indiegogo tool to easily share this project.Please have a look at https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/527376-How-to-Share-A-Campaign-With-Others
So help me and all the people out there to climb Web 4.0, the Native Web!
FAQWhy XML?Here are the reasons:
Html is also XML. And people/developers know this already. 
I needed a way to script cross-platform. 
Any simple text editor can be used. 
Tools(to output XML) can be written easily by everyone.
 XML is the de-facto standard description/interchange language.
Differences between the native web technology and a game engine? 
Though the engines can deploy to a lot of platforms it is up to the developer what will be supported. With Native Web(NW) it will definitely run on all supported platforms out of the box! Though sometimes some adaption needs to be done by the developer for the best experience.
NW has easier distribution. Time from buying to play is really short.
NW uses easy out of the box licensing.
NW is not only used for games. It can also be used for any other purpose.

 

Finally I'd like to ask you a nerdy riddle.

The first who sponsors this campaign and solves this puzzle gets a cool secret thing when the campaign reaches the main goal!Hint: You should be a programmer to be able to solve this puzzle.
Here the puzzle:
We are looking for a word. Add the 5 missing numbers in between. But this is not the solution. Find another hidden number and subtract it. Now and unsigned short -3.
What is the result?Hint. Any sentence counts!As help I recommend to use the windows calculator in programmer mode.

<p>Game On Magazine  (<a href=""http://www.gameonmagazine.co.za"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.gameonmagazine.co.za</a>) was created to support and nurture our love of Sport in South Africa, starting in our early school years and culminating in professional sport.  We don't just talk about the people who are currently stars, we aim to share inspiring stories of how the ""stars"" got to be stars, and to start to tell the stories of the emerging stars of tomorrow and inspire the as yet to be stars to believe and become all they choose to be in the sport they are most passionate about.</p>Our magazine is constantly hearing how extremely talented and passionate young sports stars cannot participate in national and international competitions, or afford basic kit and uniforms for the National Teams, and whose big dreams are not realised because sports that are not considered a high priority, just do not receive the government or public funding they so desperately need to allow top athletes/sports girls/boys/men/women to represent their regions or country at high profile events.   This is just wrong....... dream killing is wrong!<p>Many of these youngsters come from very low income families, and without sponsors, cannot participate at all. </p>
<p>Game On is choosing to make a difference.........  We want to change the face of sport funding in South Africa and we need your help to do it.  <br/></p>
<p>We want to create an independent sports wealth fund that is not controlled by parastatals or organisations (that have their own agenda as to how to manage these funds).  To do this (and show everyone IT CAN BE DONE), we are opening the floor to EVERYONE WHO LOVES SPORT to ask you to contribute whatever you can and feel inspired to, so that we can begin to make a difference in these amazing young people's lives. <br/></p>
<p>If a million people just contribute $1, we can move mountains for so many talented young people. </p>

<p>""If you could dream it, you could do it"" . ~ Walt Disney</p>
<p><u><strong>It's all begin with a dream</strong>. </u><br/>A dream to make impacts for helping parents and children with a good daycare.</p>
<p>Oct 2016,  We had a <strong>passion to build a good daycare in Jakarta</strong> to help busy parents nurture their beloved children. </p>
<p>We see this passion as <strong>an urgent need, not only to parents but to the children too as they need to have a good and proper care on SQ, EQ and IQ</strong> that the children might not get from a regular baby sitting/babysitter.</p>
<p>Daycare especially good daycare is very rare in Jakarta, and We're seeing this as a <strong>call and challenge for us to start building one</strong>.</p>
<p><u>We're <strong>not seeing this opportunity only in business perspective but we see this passion as a way to help both parents and children</strong>. </u></p>
<p><strong>For Parents</strong> (especially parents that both are working from 9 to 5), leaving their children to a new babysitter might had some issue of trust, will the new babysitter could nurture ,love , care their child/children and had a proper action on how to handle babysitting? We've heard some (not majority) of babysitters doing some scary violance to a baby because they don't have a true passion, love and care to other's children.</p>
<p><strong>For Babies/Children</strong> that are under baby sitting mostly only get an ordinary / common upbringing from babysitter, without a proper education on teaching the children about knowing each other, right/wrong, good character, good knowledge, physical activity on playground, stimulation on playing an education toys, toilet training, how to say good words like thank you, sorry, motoric stimulation, etc. </p>
<p>Good character education nowaday seems faded away and <strong>we need to fix it starting from a good family model</strong>. We believe that <strong>good manner/character is a seed</strong> that must ""planted"" from baby/child age.</p>
<p>Those circumstances makes us sad to hear it and <strong>wants to make changes for the situation</strong> (we started to save money in order to make this dream possible) and was the background why we had passion to build a daycare that is called Trust DayCare.</p>
<p><u>Trust DayCare is a new daycare located at West Jakarta established at Oct 2016.</u></p>

</div></div>","""If you could dream it, you could do it"" . ~ Walt Disney
It's all begin with a dream. A dream to make impacts for helping parents and children with a good daycare.
Oct 2016,  We had a passion to build a good daycare in Jakarta to help busy parents nurture their beloved children. 
We see this passion as an urgent need, not only to parents but to the children too as they need to have a good and proper care on SQ, EQ and IQ that the children might not get from a regular baby sitting/babysitter.
Daycare especially good daycare is very rare in Jakarta, and We're seeing this as a call and challenge for us to start building one.
We're not seeing this opportunity only in business perspective but we see this passion as a way to help both parents and children. 
For Parents (especially parents that both are working from 9 to 5), leaving their children to a new babysitter might had some issue of trust, will the new babysitter could nurture ,love , care their child/children and had a proper action on how to handle babysitting? We've heard some (not majority) of babysitters doing some scary violance to a baby because they don't have a true passion, love and care to other's children.
For Babies/Children that are under baby sitting mostly only get an ordinary / common upbringing from babysitter, without a proper education on teaching the children about knowing each other, right/wrong, good character, good knowledge, physical activity on playground, stimulation on playing an education toys, toilet training, how to say good words like thank you, sorry, motoric stimulation, etc. 
Good character education nowaday seems faded away and we need to fix it starting from a good family model. We believe that good manner/character is a seed that must ""planted"" from baby/child age.
Those circumstances makes us sad to hear it and wants to make changes for the situation (we started to save money in order to make this dream possible) and was the background why we had passion to build a daycare that is called Trust DayCare.
Trust DayCare is a new daycare located at West Jakarta established at Oct 2016.

I was that career woman caught up and chained in the chaos of Corporate America until I broke through the barriers of fear and failure and decided that I was worthy of more. I can make a positive impact in the world.  I have experienced firsthand how liberating and empowering it can be to know your purpose and the value of walking in it to make a difference. I started L².I.F.T because I want to be a living example of empowerment for my two beautiful nieces to pave the way for them and women around the world to take the limits off of their dreams and guide them through necessary steps to realize them. Research shows that less than 30% of America’s business owners are women and the gender gap closes when women fund women, which is why mentor-ship and scholarship is a vital part of our mission. By educating and providing the development necessary to pursue entrepreneurship and leadership as well as finance, we can help women become prepared for the hosts of challenges they face as women in business.  I created L².I.F.T because I want to enable woman to break barriers of fear and embark on an empowered life of seeking limitless possibilities in which they may pay it forward to future generations.We have made great strides since launching in 2016. Our first entrepreneurial workshop was booked to capacity drawing in women from the local community and surrounding areas. In 2017, we started the “I AM” movement in which women from across the nation were inspired, encouraged and empowered to share their stories, dispel lies of self-doubt and affirm the greatness within them; due its success, the “I AM…Affirmations of an Empowered Woman” seminar quickly ensued. Featuring a panel of women entrepreneurs from different walks of life and various industries, including international panelists, “I AM…Affirmations of an Empowered Woman” impacted women nationwide. Your support is pivotal to help widen our reach and strengthen our impact as L².I.F.T desires to empower women around the world through our programs, workshops and empowerment events.We are seeking $50,000 to pursue marketing efforts. The funds will go towards:
Enhanced Software
Curriculum development
External sourcing for inspirational complementary products
Live empowerment events and workshops
But most closely to our hearts, a percentage of the funds will be allocated towards start-up investment scholarships for deserving women. According to business news daily, “Raising capital is even more difficult for women owned firms: A 2014 Babson College report found that less than three-percent of venture capital-funded companies had female CEOs. All funds will be used towards developing programs and products, but most importantly optimizing on our efficiencies.Exceeding our goal will help us to increase visibility and broaden our marketing exposure faster, setup the best fulfillment solution to handle higher demand, create a world class team and provide other employment opportunities.As a contributor, you can look forward to some of our exciting perks at every level to show just how much we appreciate your generosity; including L².I.F.T branded inspirational products, loads of swag gifts, meet and greet brunch opportunities in your city and a chance to be an honorary guest at a L².I.F.T empowerment event!As a virtual-based business, supportive software is crucial to L².I.F.T’s efficiency and success; however, keeping up with the latest and greatest technological advancements could prove to be costly and takes time to implement. Curriculum enhancement, production fulfillment and shipping costs are all the things we strive to achieve the best efficiencies for programs and products. Our campaign and efforts beyond it will bring those efficiencies within reach, so please be sure to spread the word! We want every woman to feel liberated and empowered, paving the way for future generations, so we will explore different models to make our barrier breaking mentor-ship and scholarship programs available to under privileged women and young girls around the world.While we greatly appreciate those who offer financial contributions, we understand that not everyone has the means to donate, but you can still help by telling everyone you know. Spreading the word is just as valuable to us as your financial support and we THANK YOU for helping us in any way you can. You can use the share tools on this page to share with other champions of women empowerment and leadership. Social media is also one of the easiest and fastest ways to get the word out!Here are some our suggested language and hashtags for you to use or feel free to create your own:  Facebook & Instagram Join me in closing the gender gap: support women entrepreneurship igg.me/at/empowerher2lift #queendompreneur #lift2empowerwomen #shesempowered2lift #shesoarsinbizLet’s start her off strong as #shebuildsbiz, as a woman entrepreneur igg.me/at/empowerher2lift #queendompreneur #lift2empowerwomen #shesempowered2lift #shesoarsinbizIt’s a movement!

<p>The coronavirus pandemic has shaken the world, and unfortunately the sports world has been put on hold. For the past 150+ years, baseball has been an American pastime begining in the spring.  This year it will be delayed.  While we go through baseball withdrawals, it is the perfect time to learn how to make watching baseball more enjoyable and exciting.  You can be part of the action and feel the rush of competition. Daily fantasy baseball is a great diversion from the stresses of everyday life, and a way to escape for a few hours.  A Whole New Ball Game is a step by step book that will teach you how to win at daily fantasy baseball. Through lessons learned over the past 20+ years, there are specific statistics that you can rely on to predict future results.  I will teach you how to gather this information for free and how to build winning lineups.  A Whole New Ball Game will teach you the 3 secrets professional fantasy players don't want you to know about playing daily fantasy baseball.</p>

<p>You will learn how to rank Starting Pitching, Hitting, Bullpens, Weather, and Ballpark Factor in minutes. More importantly, how to sort that information and turn it into winning Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) lineups. This system was used to win over $450k in the past two years only taking about 15 minutes a day! Although, these results are not typical.  You don’t need to be an excel wizard with algorithms. You can win at daily fantasy sports as a hobby, it does not need to be a full time job. This book is designed to make you self-reliant and not have to buy picks or join membership sites.</p>

<p>This book is written by Anthony Lange, known as Clubber62 in the fantasy sports industry.  Anthony started Step By Step Sports University to help sports fans learn to play Daily Fantasy successfully. This is something we are very passionate about. We will teach with a combination of online courses, livestreams, and resource guides. We lay out the exact blueprint so you can benefit from 20+ years of experience and win consistently!</p>
<p> I am writing this book because I was sick of seeing people taken advantage of by the fake sports gurus. The quality of the information being sold is terrible and customers are wasting their money on losing sports picks and lineup purchases. I have learned a lot in my time playing daily fantasy sports. While learning these lessons I have won hundreds of thousands of dollars and been to multiple DFS World Championships.  I don't say this to brag, but to ensure you that the information you are getting has worked!  I have been able to break down my process for picking winning MLB lineups into easily repeatable steps. I genuinely want my students to succeed. So much so, I am going to be creating an online fantasy sports community to support you on your journey. This will help make sure you are on the right track.  If all this book did was make your fantasy sports hobby profitable, would it be worth it?</p>

<p>I am reaching out to the fantasy sports community to help bring good information to the masses and keep things interesting while we're all staying home. We are going to have a bunch of unique rewards available to our backers.  We will have everything from limited edition merchandise, private lessons with Anthony, Slack chat access, weekly livestreams, and even Anthony's daily plays sent to you.  These items will only be available to people who pledge to this campaign and we will be posting new rewards a few times a week, so keep checking this space!

<h1>HI HERE App: una proposta innovativa per rispondere alla ""crisi dei rifugiati""</h1>
<div><br/></div>
<div>HI HERE<strong> </strong>è una <b>App</b> che permette ai <b>rifugiati</b> di connettersi, condividere la propria esperienza e raccogliere informazioni sul diritto di asilo e i servizi locali di accoglienza, verso il <b>recupero psicologico</b>, l'<b>empowerment</b> e l'<b>integrazione</b>.</div>

<p> </p>
<div>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">HI HERE è una soluzione generata dal basso</span></h3>
<div>
<p>HI HERE nasce dai bisogni concreti espressi dai richiedenti asilo stessi e fornisce loro un mezzo per creare una rete di supporto reciproco in cui poter esprimere la propria voce.</p>
<h3><strong>HI HERE è unica</strong></h3>
<p>HI HERE riesce a dare una risposta comune a diversi bisogni: connettere, informare, dare voce e supportare.</p>
<h3>HI HERE è scalabile</h3>HI HERE si sviluppa a partire dal territorio italiano, ma è ideata per essere successivamente potenziata e diffusa in tutta Europa.</div>
</div>

<p></p>
<h1>HI HERE ha bisogno del tuo supporto per completare la programmazione della App</h1>

<br/><p></p>
<p>HI HERE sta diventando realtà grazie al contributo di organizzazioni e persone come te! Ogni piccola donazione farà la differenza. E' stimato che:</p>
<h4><strong>per ogni EURO donato un RIFUGIATO potrà scaricare HI HERE gratuitamente!</strong></h4>
<p>Nel 2015 più di <b>un milione di migranti</b> hanno raggiunto l'Europa via mare e si stima che nel 2016 il numero di arrivi sarà ancora maggiore.</p>
<h3><strong>Cosa succede se HI HERE riceve più di 20'000 euro?</strong></h3>
<div><strong><h4><strong>Maggiori i fondi a disposizione, più numerose saranno le realtà locali raggiunte da HI HERE!</strong></h4></strong></div>
<p>Con questa campagna HI HERE si pone l'obiettivo di completare la programmazione della App, ma il lavoro per sfruttare al meglio le potenzialità di HI HERE non finisce qui. Ogni donazione ulteriore verrà utilizzata per finanziare la campagna di diffusione di HI HERE in Italia, programmata per l'estate 2016. </p>

<h3><strong>HI HERE ha trovato una prima comunità di consenso e supporto</strong></h3>
<p>L’Università <i>London School of Economics</i> ha già sostenuto HI HERE ospitando un evento di live crowdfunding YTFN il 26 gennaio 2016, dove il progetto è stato presentato in anteprima. I fondi e le competenze ottenuti in questa serata hanno reso possibile avviare la programmazione della App.</p>
<h3>Quali sono i passi futuri?</h3>
<p>Nel maggio 2016, quando una versione test di HI HERE sarà pronta, verranno eseguiti i primi test nelle città di Trento, Parma e Foggia coinvolgendo direttamente le realtà locali che si occupano di accoglienza e i richiedenti asilo presenti in questi territori.</p>
<p>La App sarà perfezionata secondo i riscontri dati dai test per essere lanciata ufficialmente a fine giugno 2016. HI HERE sarà scaricabile gratuitamente da smartphone con sistema operativo Android e iOS.</p>
<p>Durante l'estate 2016 si svolgerà una campagna di diffusione della App in tutta Italia.</p>

<h4>HI HERE si propone di tradurre la RICERCA in AZIONE!</h4>
<p></p>
<p>HI HERE nasce da un'approfondita ricerca sui sistemi di accoglienza di richiedenti asilo e rifugiati, condotta da Martina per il conseguimento del MSc in Regional and Urban Planning Studies (<i>London School of Economics</i>, novembre 2015). </p>
<p>Durante il lavoro sul campo condotto in sud Italia durante l'estate 2015, Martina e Caterina hanno rilevato alcuni degli aspetti critici dell'accoglienza ed hanno potuto analizzare i principali bisogni espressi dagli stessi richiedenti asilo: ristabilire dei legami sociali, accedere all'informazione, trovare nuove opportunità, esprimere la propria voce.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458650752/aiknuv38foktkiwitha4.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<h4>Una App per smartphone è lo STRUMENTO più efficace per CONNETTERE, INFORMARE, DARE VOCE e SUPPORTARE il maggior numero di richiedenti asilo!</h4>
<p></p>
</div><p>La maggior parte dei richiedenti asilo investe i propri risparmi nell'acquisto di uno smartphone per potersi connettere in un punto WiFi ed avere accesso ai social network. In questo modo i migranti hanno la possibilità di rintracciare familiari e conterranei presenti in Italia e/o in Europa per comunicare con essi, condividere commenti sui territori ospitanti cercando nuove opportunità, raccogliere informazioni sul diritto di asilo e sui servizi di accoglienza locali.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458655258/xdxlfcmglvigglfhkjtg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Quale impatto avrà HI HERE?</span><br/></p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""></span></p><h4>Oltre ad assistere i richiedenti asilo, HI HERE costituisce un mezzo per migliorare il Sistema Nazionale di Protezione, la rete di ONG operanti nel campo dell’accoglienza e l'intera società!</h4><p></p><div>

<p></p>
<div><p><strong>Monitoraggio dal basso</strong></p></div>
<p></p>
<div><div><p>Raccogliendo le esperienze e le percezioni dei richiedenti asilo sui progetti e i servizi di accoglienza locali, HI HERE fornisce un monitoraggio dal basso esteso a tutta Italia. Il team di HI HERE avrà un accesso sicuro e controllato a questi dati e produrrà report scritti misurando la soddisfazione dei richiedenti asilo riguardo al Sistema Nazionale di Protezione.</p></div></div>
<p></p>
<div><p><strong>Potenziamento della rete di ONG</strong></p></div>
<p></p>
<div><div><p>HI HERE potenzia il raggio d’azione e l’efficienza della rete di ONG. Postando annunci, eventi e offrendo aiuto online, le ONG saranno in grado di raggiungere un ampio numero di utenti in differenti località. Inoltre, una maggiore trasparenza nella fornitura di servizi migliorerà la qualità dei servizi stessi.</p></div></div>
<p></p>
<div><p><strong>Superamento di barriere sociali</strong></p></div>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>HI HERE aiuta a superare i pregiudizi e le barriere all'integrazione, nella convinzione che questi siano causati da disinformazione e mancanza di contatto diretto tra rifugiati e comunità locali. Tutta la popolazione potrà scaricare HI HERE, entrare in contatto con la realtà dei migranti e raccogliere personalmente informazioni sul funzionamento dell’accoglienza.</p>

<p>HI HERE runs on contributions from organisations and people like you! Every small donation can make a huge difference. It is estimated that:</p>
<h4><strong>every EURO donated, a REFUGEE will download HI HERE for free!</strong></h4>
<p>In 2015 <b>over a million migrants</b> made their way to Europe by sea and it is foreseen that in 2016 the number will be even greater.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>What happens if HI HERE gets more than 20'000 euros?</strong></h3>
<div><strong><h4><strong>The more funds we raise, the higher the number of localities HI HERE will be able to reach!</strong></h4></strong></div>
<p>Through the campaign, we aim to complete the development of the App. Anyway, much more work has to be done to take full advantage of HI HERE potentiality. We will invest any additional donation in HI HERE marketing campaign, which is planned for summer 2016.</p>

<h3><strong>HI HERE has found a first community of support</strong></h3>
<p>The <i>London School of Economics</i> has already supported HI HERE by hosting a live crowd funding event (YTFN) at which the project was presented. That event enabled us to raise the funds and recruit the skills we needed to get the project up and running.</p>
<h3>What are the next steps?</h3>
<p>In May 2016, when the HI HERE test version will be ready, we will test the App in Trento, Parma and Foggia, involving local organizations and refugees settled in these territories.</p>
<p>The App will be redefined according to the test findings, in order to be officially launched at the end of June 2016. It will be possible to download HI HERE for free to smartphones with Android and iOS operating systems.</p>
<p>During summer 2016, a marketing campaign will occur all over Italy.</p>

<div><h4>HI HERE aims to translate RESEARCH into ACTION!</h4></div>
<div>

HI HERE App: una proposta innovativa per rispondere alla ""crisi dei rifugiati""

HI HERE è una App che permette ai rifugiati di connettersi, condividere la propria esperienza e raccogliere informazioni sul diritto di asilo e i servizi locali di accoglienza, verso il recupero psicologico, l'empowerment e l'integrazione.



I punti di forza di HI HERE
 

HI HERE è una soluzione generata dal basso

HI HERE nasce dai bisogni concreti espressi dai richiedenti asilo stessi e fornisce loro un mezzo per creare una rete di supporto reciproco in cui poter esprimere la propria voce.
HI HERE è unica
HI HERE riesce a dare una risposta comune a diversi bisogni: connettere, informare, dare voce e supportare.
HI HERE è scalabileHI HERE si sviluppa a partire dal territorio italiano, ma è ideata per essere successivamente potenziata e diffusa in tutta Europa.



HI HERE ha bisogno del tuo supporto per completare la programmazione della App



HI HERE sta diventando realtà grazie al contributo di organizzazioni e persone come te! Ogni piccola donazione farà la differenza. E' stimato che:
per ogni EURO donato un RIFUGIATO potrà scaricare HI HERE gratuitamente!
Nel 2015 più di un milione di migranti hanno raggiunto l'Europa via mare e si stima che nel 2016 il numero di arrivi sarà ancora maggiore.
Cosa succede se HI HERE riceve più di 20'000 euro?
Maggiori i fondi a disposizione, più numerose saranno le realtà locali raggiunte da HI HERE!
Con questa campagna HI HERE si pone l'obiettivo di completare la programmazione della App, ma il lavoro per sfruttare al meglio le potenzialità di HI HERE non finisce qui. Ogni donazione ulteriore verrà utilizzata per finanziare la campagna di diffusione di HI HERE in Italia, programmata per l'estate 2016. 


Il quadro della situazione: traguardi raggiunti ed obiettivi futuri







HI HERE ha trovato una prima comunità di consenso e supporto
L’Università London School of Economics ha già sostenuto HI HERE ospitando un evento di live crowdfunding YTFN il 26 gennaio 2016, dove il progetto è stato presentato in anteprima. I fondi e le competenze ottenuti in questa serata hanno reso possibile avviare la programmazione della App.
Quali sono i passi futuri?
Nel maggio 2016, quando una versione test di HI HERE sarà pronta, verranno eseguiti i primi test nelle città di Trento, Parma e Foggia coinvolgendo direttamente le realtà locali che si occupano di accoglienza e i richiedenti asilo presenti in questi territori.
La App sarà perfezionata secondo i riscontri dati dai test per essere lanciata ufficialmente a fine giugno 2016. HI HERE sarà scaricabile gratuitamente da smartphone con sistema operativo Android e iOS.
Durante l'estate 2016 si svolgerà una campagna di diffusione della App in tutta Italia.

Come è nato il progetto HI HERE?

HI HERE si propone di tradurre la RICERCA in AZIONE!

HI HERE nasce da un'approfondita ricerca sui sistemi di accoglienza di richiedenti asilo e rifugiati, condotta da Martina per il conseguimento del MSc in Regional and Urban Planning Studies (London School of Economics, novembre 2015). 
Durante il lavoro sul campo condotto in sud Italia durante l'estate 2015, Martina e Caterina hanno rilevato alcuni degli aspetti critici dell'accoglienza ed hanno potuto analizzare i principali bisogni espressi dagli stessi richiedenti asilo: ristabilire dei legami sociali, accedere all'informazione, trovare nuove opportunità, esprimere la propria voce.

Perchè una App?

Una App per smartphone è lo STRUMENTO più efficace per CONNETTERE, INFORMARE, DARE VOCE e SUPPORTARE il maggior numero di richiedenti asilo!

La maggior parte dei richiedenti asilo investe i propri risparmi nell'acquisto di uno smartphone per potersi connettere in un punto WiFi ed avere accesso ai social network. In questo modo i migranti hanno la possibilità di rintracciare familiari e conterranei presenti in Italia e/o in Europa per comunicare con essi, condividere commenti sui territori ospitanti cercando nuove opportunità, raccogliere informazioni sul diritto di asilo e sui servizi di accoglienza locali.Quale impatto avrà HI HERE?Oltre ad assistere i richiedenti asilo, HI HERE costituisce un mezzo per migliorare il Sistema Nazionale di Protezione, la rete di ONG operanti nel campo dell’accoglienza e l'intera società!



Monitoraggio dal basso

Raccogliendo le esperienze e le percezioni dei richiedenti asilo sui progetti e i servizi di accoglienza locali, HI HERE fornisce un monitoraggio dal basso esteso a tutta Italia. Il team di HI HERE avrà un accesso sicuro e controllato a questi dati e produrrà report scritti misurando la soddisfazione dei richiedenti asilo riguardo al Sistema Nazionale di Protezione.

Potenziamento della rete di ONG

HI HERE potenzia il raggio d’azione e l’efficienza della rete di ONG. Postando annunci, eventi e offrendo aiuto online, le ONG saranno in grado di raggiungere un ampio numero di utenti in differenti località. Inoltre, una maggiore trasparenza nella fornitura di servizi migliorerà la qualità dei servizi stessi.

Superamento di barriere sociali


HI HERE aiuta a superare i pregiudizi e le barriere all'integrazione, nella convinzione che questi siano causati da disinformazione e mancanza di contatto diretto tra rifugiati e comunità locali. Tutta la popolazione potrà scaricare HI HERE, entrare in contatto con la realtà dei migranti e raccogliere personalmente informazioni sul funzionamento dell’accoglienza.

(ENG)HI HERE App: an innovative proposal in response to the ""refugee crises""

HI HERE is a mobile phone App enabling refugees to connect, share their experience, and gather information on asylum law and local services of reception towards psychological recovery, empowerment and integration.



Main strenghts of HI HERE

HI HERE is a bottom up solution
HI HERE generates from concrete needs, as expressed by asylum seekers themselves. HI HERE provides a network of  mutual support enabling asylum seekers to express their voice.
HI HERE is unique
HI HERE is a joint response to multiple needs: connect, inform, empower and recover.
HI HERE is scalableHI HERE takes form in the Italian context, but it is designed to be progressively upgraded and diffused all over Europe.


HI HERE needs your support to complete the development of the App





HI HERE runs on contributions from organisations and people like you! Every small donation can make a huge difference. It is estimated that:
every EURO donated, a REFUGEE will download HI HERE for free!
In 2015 over a million migrants made their way to Europe by sea and it is foreseen that in 2016 the number will be even greater.

What happens if HI HERE gets more than 20'000 euros?
The more funds we raise, the higher the number of localities HI HERE will be able to reach!
Through the campaign, we aim to complete the development of the App. Anyway, much more work has to be done to take full advantage of HI HERE potentiality. We will invest any additional donation in HI HERE marketing campaign, which is planned for summer 2016.


Picture of the situation: achieved goals and future objectives



HI HERE has found a first community of support
The London School of Economics has already supported HI HERE by hosting a live crowd funding event (YTFN) at which the project was presented. That event enabled us to raise the funds and recruit the skills we needed to get the project up and running.
What are the next steps?
In May 2016, when the HI HERE test version will be ready, we will test the App in Trento, Parma and Foggia, involving local organizations and refugees settled in these territories.
The App will be redefined according to the test findings, in order to be officially launched at the end of June 2016. It will be possible to download HI HERE for free to smartphones with Android and iOS operating systems.
During summer 2016, a marketing campaign will occur all over Italy.

How was HI HERE born?
HI HERE aims to translate RESEARCH into ACTION!

HI HERE is the result of extensive research regarding systems of refugee reception conducted by Martina for the completion of an MSc in Regional and Urban Planning Studies (London School of Economics, November 2015).
During the fieldwork conducted in Southern Italy in the summer 2015, Martina and Caterina noticed some of the critical aspects of reception. They analized the main needs reported by asylum seekers: re-establishing their social networks, accessing information, getting new opportunities, expressing their voice.



Why an App?



A mobile phone App is the most efficient TOOL to CONNECT, INFORM, EMPOWER and RECOVER as much asylum seekers as possible!

Most asylum seekers invest all of their savings in buying smartphones to connect to WiFi hot spots and access social networks. They do so to catch up with dispersed family members and countrymen in Italy and all over Europe, to share comments on the host territories in search of new opportunities, to gather information on asylum rights and local services of reception.



What impact will HI HERE have?

In addition to assisting refugees, HI HERE constitutes a tool to improve the National System of Protection, the network of NGOs operating in the field of reception and wide society!
Bottom up monitorage
HI HERE provides bottom-up, nation-wide monitoring of local projects and local services of protection, through collecting asylum seekers’ experiences and perceptions. The team of HI HERE will have secure access to this data and will produce written reports surveying asylum seekers’ satisfaction with the National System of protection.
NGOs networking
HI HERE enhances the outreach and the efficiency of the NGOs’ network. By posting announcements, events and offers of help online, NGOs will be able to reach a wide range of users at different locations. Moreover, greater transparency in service provision will enhance the quality of the services provided.
Breaking down social barriers
HI HERE helps to break down prejudices and barriers to integration, in the conviction that these are based on misinformation and a lack of contact between refugee and local communities. Anybody will be able to download HI HERE, get in touch with the refugees' reality and gather first hand information on the functioning of protection.

Then, to interconnect those of rural areas with those of urban schools. Finally, interconnect all schools around the world. In a world that is more and more competitive we have to give the same opportunity in life to everybody, one education for all. That is why, student’s coaching is so important just to prepare them for a world that is replete with challenges and competitiveness.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>impact</strong></p><p>   The project’s overall outcome is to reduce academic mediocrity. To rise up the school level and help many students of different areas to be competitive.</p><p>According to a ranking of the world’s best 500 done in 2017 by Jiotong, of the University of Shanghai , Africa had only three representations. We are also backward in secondary education with very few exceptions. Education, Knowledge, is a powerful arm for the development of a nation. We have to assure a better education to our youth to rise up many talents and not only have a minority as we have today. Many young students, estimated at a million all over our continent, are facing many problems of academic care, coaching and orientation. Many young talented people who lack academic care, orientation and financial resources generally go astray and fall short of in their way to successful integration into the society.</p><p> </p><p align=""center""><strong>Who is the project’s founder?</strong></p><p>I’m Jacques Opepam, young entrepreneur, student engineer in Industrial engineering and holder of a Master 2(University of Douala- Cameroon).</p><p>I did my primary and secondary course at SA’A, 70 km from Yaoundé.

Un élève qui fait par exemple une Terminale  Scientifique, s’interconnecte avec tous ceux qui font la même classe. De manière journalière, les problèmes sont posés et résolus sous plusieurs formats (images, PDF, Vidéos, Audio et autres).Objectifs du projetLe projet vise tout d’abord à apporter une assistance académique à distance aux élèves des zones rurales et enclavées d’Afrique. Ensuite, à interconnecter les élèves des zones enclavées avec les établissements des grands centres urbains. Enfin, interconnecter tous ces établissements  à l’international. Il est question ici, dans un monde de plus en plus compétitif, de permettre une égalité de chance pour tous, une éducation équitable. Le coaching des élèves est important pour les préparer à un Monde en pleine mutation et compétitif.L’impactLe projet viendra réduire l’échec scolaire, rehausser le niveau scolaire des élèves et étudiants et permettre à une majorité de ces derniers de divers horizons d’être compétitifs.Selon le dernier classement 2017 des 500 meilleures Universités du Monde par l’Université jiotong de Shanghaï, l’Afrique n’a que trois universités représentées dans ce classement. Nous sommes  également  en arrière dans l'enseignement  secondaire  avec quelques exceptions. L’éducation, le savoir est l’arme de développement de toute nation. Nous pensons qu’il faut assurer une meilleure éducation à notre jeunesse afin d’éclore une multitude de talents et non la minorité comme c'est le cas en ce moment .De dizaines de millions de jeunes élèves et étudiants à travers le continent font face à de multiples problèmes d’encadrement académique, de coaching et d’orientation. Plusieurs jeunes Talentueux, du fait du manque d'encadrement, d’orientation et de moyens financiers, sombrent dans la débauche d'où l’arrêt brusque d’études de certains et la non insertion dans la société. Présentation du porteur de projetJe suis  jacques OPEPAM, entrepreneur et élève ingénieur en Génie Industriel, MASTER 2 (Université de Douala-Cameroun).J’ai effectué mon cycle primaire et secondaire dans l’arrondissement de SA'A,  à 70 km de Yaoundé, où j’ai parallèlement développé des activités en agriculture et vannerie alors que j’étais en classe de 5ième. Après mon Baccalauréat en science  Physique et Mathématique (BACC ''C'')  en 2012, j’intègre l’une des prestigieuses écoles d’ingénieur de la sous-région, la Faculté de Génies Industriel (FGI) de Douala-Cameroun. A peine deux mois de cours, j’ai la chance de rencontrer  un aîné académique aujourd’hui  patron d’une PME prospère, qui va réveiller en moi l’amour de l’entrepreneuriat. Je commence par la conception des fascicules (corrections des sujets d’examens et autres), puis je continu à développer des projets Technologiques avec des camarades. Président du Club de ma filière (TCI) en Master 1 , je décide me lancer définitivement dans l’entrepreneuriat dans le but d’aider notre jeunesse à une réussite scolaire et une meilleure insertion dans le monde socio-professionnel. Je pense être à la hauteur et j’espère rejoindre les grandes figures de l’entrepreneuriat moderne à l’instar de TONY ELUMELU (Nigéria), Paul FOKAM KOMOGNE (Cameroun),Elon Musk (USA), Jeff Bezos et autres. L’équipe Nous sommes une jeune équipe dynamique de 6 membres et une cinquantaine de volontaires1) Jacques Opepam                                      Ceo and Co-Founder   2) Gaelle Patricia Talotsing                        Co-Founder3) Louisette  Ateba Fouda ,                         Marketiste4) Rodolf Biloa Ngah                                     Développeur5) Daril Ousmanou                                        DéveloppeurResponsable  département 6) Mathématique :      Kuate Hyppolite ; licence en Mathématique-master 1 en HSSI    Technologique :     Onana jean pierre ; licence en physique -master 2 en TCI     Physique :                Tchoupa Albin, licence en physique- master 1 en HSSIUne cinquantaine de volontaires Licenciés, Masters, Doctorants et Docteurs en diverses disciplines travaillent avec nous. Pourquoi le Crowdfunding ?Nous recherchons 5000 &  pour s’implémenter et se déployer sur le terrain dès la prochaine rentrée scolaire 2018/2019 au Mois de Septembre.   Utilisation des fonds 1) Développement de l’application mobile (1500 $)2) Achats du matériel de travail et informatique (ordinateurs, imprimantes, photocopieuses,  Vidéo projecteurs, cameras, micros et autres) (2000 $)3) Frais internet (pour  100 utilisateurs à destination des correcteurs) pendant 03 mois (700 $)4) Fonds de roulement (800 $)Total : 5000 $Nos référencesNous avons un site internet www.intellectcameroun.com , une page Facebook intellect Cameroun https://web.facebook.com/Intellectcameroun/.

Our mission is to bring school support, coaching and orientation in a system where only the rich have access to quality education.This an ambitious and social project because it provides quality academic assistance to students wherever they are. Moreover it’s a vector to share experiences and knowledge between students in different location, in real time. This can reduce inequalities between those who can afford access to good schools and those who can’t. In Few Words (Summary)Intellect is a set of virtual classrooms, where students are grouped by specialties. A student doing for example upper sixth science connected with those of the same level.Objective of projectThe main objective of project is to provide remote academic assistance to students in rural areas. Then, to interconnect those of rural areas with those of urban schools. Finally, interconnect all schools around the world. In a world that is more and more competitive we have to give the same opportunity in life to everybody, one education for all. That is why, student’s coaching is so important just to prepare them for a world that is replete with challenges and competitiveness.impact   The project’s overall outcome is to reduce academic mediocrity. To rise up the school level and help many students of different areas to be competitive.According to a ranking of the world’s best 500 done in 2017 by Jiotong, of the University of Shanghai , Africa had only three representations. We are also backward in secondary education with very few exceptions. Education, Knowledge, is a powerful arm for the development of a nation. We have to assure a better education to our youth to rise up many talents and not only have a minority as we have today. Many young students, estimated at a million all over our continent, are facing many problems of academic care, coaching and orientation. Many young talented people who lack academic care, orientation and financial resources generally go astray and fall short of in their way to successful integration into the society. Who is the project’s founder?I’m Jacques Opepam, young entrepreneur, student engineer in Industrial engineering and holder of a Master 2(University of Douala- Cameroon).I did my primary and secondary course at SA’A, 70 km from Yaoundé. In form 2, I started doing some agriculture and basketry. After my Baccaulaureat in Physics and Mathematics in 2012, I went to the prestigious Faculty of industrial engineering (FGI) of the University of Douala- Cameroun. After only  two Months of attendance, I was lucky to meet an academic elder ,who’s the chairman of a medium enterprise nowadays, and he gave me the love of entrepreneurship which later develop in the desire to emulate entrepreneurship  trailblazers such as Tony Elumelu (Nigeria), Paul Fokam Komogne ( Cameroon),Elon Musk ( USA) Jeff Bezos and others.TeamWe are 6 members and more than 50 volunteers1) Jacques Opepam                                            Ceo and Co-Founder   2) Gaelle Patricia Talotsing                              Co-Founder3) Louisette   Ateba  Fouda ,                             Marketist4) Rodolf Biloa Ngah                                           Developer5) Daril  Ousmanou                                              DeveloperHead of department6) Mathematic : Kuate Hyppolite  license in mathematic- master in hssi   Technology, Onana jean pierre license in physic-Masrter 2 -TCI    Physic      Tchoupa Albin, license in physic- master 1 – HSSIAnd more than 50 volunteers having license, masters, Doctor Degrees and doing many others disciplines are working with us. Why crowdfunding?We are looking for 5000 USD for the platform’s development, on-the-ground activities for the upcoming 2018/2019 school year, as from September 2018. Use of money

Joshua laiser are the founders of Pambazuka Naisinyai School. The idea of starting Pambazuka Naisinyai School came to the mind of Frank and Joshua after seeing the challenges facing Maasai communities in Tanzania. Rev. Joshua is a Maasai by tribe and he was born and raised in the Maasai communities so he knows much about the challenges facing his communities.He says ""Education has been severe challenge in the Maasai communities as most of families don't know the importance of education for future life of their children. So we are working hard to educate parents and community in general so that they can know the importance of education. So the Pambazuka Naisinyai School is for Maasai children and nearby communities. Please join us and donate something to support this project!!Our School Started under the treeOur school started under the tree as we do not have resources to help us for building classes for the Maasai children. Education should start with their parents to educate them so that they can know the importance of education to their children. Some of the parents are now aware about education to their children so they are allowing them to attend school. We are still talking to the parents so that they can give us a good cooperation.Students and their teacher having class session under the tree Early Marriage and circumcision for the young Maasai girls.Imagine a world where every child is educated and can contribute to the development process!!So many times parents in Maasai  areas tend to give away their young girls for marriage in exchange for just a kilogram of sugar, a goat, a cow , some tea leaves and sometimes for salt. These young girls are then subjected to domestic violence, torture, early child birth and many times girls have died while giving birth because their bodies are never ready to experience child birth.Many times the parents to these girls need to be empowered with information about the benefits of keeping their children in school until they complete their education. Once these girls have acquired the education, they can provide all the above mentioned items to their parents for the rest of their lives. All that parents need to to practice some bit of patience and sacrifice a little in order to enjoy the fruits of their children.Circumcision for the women is prohibited but Maasai societies they still circumcise their young girls. We are working hard to educate them so that they can stop this.Its time to reach out to the parents in the Maasai land settings and sensitize them if we want a better future for girls. A future where they can participate in leadership positions. A future where they can make informed choices and start up families the the men of their choice.The time is now. Lets teach the Parents because they need this knowledge.Maasai girlsYoung Boys:  Young boys normally are send to keep cows and goats far away from home and come back evening everyday. Others they like to go to school but not allowed to go!!Young Maasai Kids in the bush keeping cowsEducation: Most of Maasai children don't go to school due to the environment they are living. Their parent don't understand the importance of their children to get better education. So we are trying our level best to educate these Maasai societies so that they can allow their children to go to school. Also there are scarcity of nearest school in their areas so we are working hard to build school near them to attract and convince their parent to allow them to attend school.Our effort made us to start building Pambazuka Naisinyai School http://www.pambazuka.sc.tz  for which this school started under the tree but with our own effort we have managed to build some two classes and bought some desks so we need to work hard to make it happen!! Maasai children in front of their housesWHY THIS CAMPAIGN IS IMPORTANTWe decided to start a school in Maasai society so as to convince the Maasai on Education. Maasai society is leaving a life with no permanent settlement, thus not getting a chance for schooling. Also the society lives a life of animal husbandry which is difficult for parents to allow their children in distant schools due to they depend of them for rearing animals. Therefore starting a school within Maasai society will convince parents allowing their children to attend school near by them. That is the school I started within Maasai society is purposely to help the Maasai children. It is called PAMBAZUKA NAISINYAI PRE & PRIMARY SCHOOL         http://www.pambazuka.sc.tz   . Already our school has grade one (1) with 65 pupils , grade two with 55 and grade three with 35  pupils and 4 teachers who use most of their time teaching the children for most of them can’t speak neither Swahili nor English, but Maasai language.Student doing class work on the ground  NEW TWO CLASSESThrough our own efforts we have managed to build two classes where grade one and two are using for studying. We have more 10 acres where we want to build more classes as we have more students coming soon. We want to build more classes up to seven classes, we also need to build kitchen, toilet as the one we have is not enough, computers and computer lab, well for keeping water as there is scarcity of water, desks, books, office for teachers, salaries for teachers.Our two New ClassesOur future plans are to have secondary school up to university among Maasai society in order to have education nearby so as to fight poverty by getting good education.  The importance of this campaign is to construct a school within Maasai society, also helping Maasai society withdraw from ignorance and illiteracy so a t cope with the changes of the world.Under Construction please help a bitWhat We Need We need to do the following so that we can get our school off the ground; Seven more classes, more desks, computer room, Library, computers, Office for the staff, Kitchen, Good toilet, Reading books, tank for water storage and bin maize and beans storage, lunch for the teachers and students, salaries for teachers, Scholarship and to build fence around the school. The estimation costs is $150,000.  ""Every bit will help"" Desks: We have managed to buy some desks for one class so class one will not sit on the ground again. Please support us so that we can buy more desks and build more classes!!THE FOLLOWING ARE THE REASONS AS TO WHY MY PROJECT IS VALUABLE TO DONORS AND THE WORLD  This project is very important to donors and world at large for it will connect us with Maasai society for they shall be able to communicate with different people of different nations of the world. Also this will give chance for donors to come and visit Maasai society and learn the real life and culture of Maasai. Apart from that it also helps to eradicate the number of illiterates in the world. RISKS AND CHALLENGES1. Due to studying environment being of low standard life, it is difficult to get skilled teachers and faithful constructors.2. Another challenge is teacher's salaries, where by in order to get good trainers you also have to pay them well.3. Another challenge is that , the pupils are fluently speaking Maasai native language, while their teachers don’t know the language and thus difficult to teach them4. Due to that parents couldn’t get education, and then they find no importance to take their children to school.Men at work bringing  clean water at Pambazuka School, Please help  HOW TO OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES1. Improving the teaching environment so as to encourage trained teachers to come and teach in our school. Also getting enough trusted constructors for constructing the building.2. Increasing teacher's salaries so as to motivate the coming of more teachers.3. Educating parents’ house by house on the importance of taking their children to school.Other Ways You Can HelpPlease tell friends and family about our campaign and our socially-good mission!Please share our campaign page through the IndieGoGo share buttons on our campaign page!Please share our campaign on your social networks such as facebook, twitter e.t.cThank you very much for your support!

<h3> Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>DID YOU KNOW??</strong></p>
<p><strong>37% of children arrive at kindergarten without the skills necessary for lifetime learning.</strong> <i>(Landry, S. H. (2005). Effective Early Childhood Programs: Turning Knowledge Into Action. Houston, TX: University of Texas, Health Science Center at Houston).</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>AND</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>1 in 4 children in America grow up without learning how to read.</strong> <i>(WriteExpress Corporation. ""Literacy Statistics."" Begin to Read. Accessed April 16, 2014)</i>.</p>
<p><strong>WOW!! </strong>I was shocked when I read these statistics!! As a journalist, I see the consequences of people who are unable to read and write proficiently everyday. As a mother, I am concerned about my children and my children's children and want them to have every possible opportunity to be successful in their lifetimes... and that means they need great reading and writing skills.</p>
<p>A lady who teaches the fourth grade at a Kansas school told me a few months ago that the schools have quit teaching English skills. This shocked me and at the same time, saddens me. Without basic English skills, our children are going struggle to complete tasks that require those basic skills.</p>
<p>  Hi!! My name is Candy Johansen. I’ve been in graduate school at Kansas State University for the last 4 semesters.  Before I started graduate school, as a undergraduate student at The University of Kansas, I wrote a series of 5 children’s books with Miss Molly (my pug) as the star of the books.</p>
<p>The reason I started writing the books came from Molly herself. Molly loves children and loves to interact with them. One day while watching her interact with a group of kids, I decided I wanted to write children’s learning books and let her be the star (in other words, let the children connect with her through the books).</p>
<p>Shortly after starting graduate school, I was talking with one of my professors about a thesis subject. I told him about the children’s books I had written and he was extremely interested. He prompted me to tell him more and I told him I was interested in creating more of these books. I told him I would like to travel to all 50 states and write a children’s travel book about each state. He encouraged me to use this idea for my graduate project… and then pursue it. That’s how the project came to be.</p>
<p>My goal is to make these books educational, but fun at the same time. I don’t want them to replicate an encyclopedia type book- I want kids to be engaged and interested- and want to read them. I plan to include some history of each state, famous people who were born, lived in or currently live in the state, landmarks, interesting places in that state, state foods, and fun things to do and see. The books will have space for children to include their own memorabilia when they visit the states themselves. <strong>The U.S. Department of Education found that generally the more students read for fun on their own time, the higher their reading scores.</strong></p>
<p>I have a degree in photography, so I plan to take all the photos that we will put in the books. Nothing would make us happier than to have a child laugh as they learn and then be inspired to want to visit each state. <i>Imagine the stories they will tell!!</i></p>
<p>Our aim is to promote literacy and instill a sense of adventure in our youth. <i>I want to do my part in helping children develop good reading and writing skills.</i></p>
<p><strong>If solid reading skills aren't formed during a child's early years, the odds of dropping out down the road increase significantly. Kids who aren't successfully reading at grade level by the third grade are four times less likely to finish high school.</strong></p>
<p>We are using Molly as our mascot to keep things fun for the kids… and we know that kids relate well to dogs. As an added treat, we hope to meet other pug and dog enthusiasts during our travels. I have met so many wonderful pug and other dog owners through social media and we would love to be able to stop and say “hi” while traveling through your state.  We look forward to making many new friends in new places. And… if you want, you can even be a part of our adventure!</p>
<p>We DO need your help!  It’s going to take a lot of money to do this 50 states project… and to print all the books. <i>As any author knows, writing a book is challenging and time consuming. </i>There are 50 books in this series- one book for each state. Since I'll be writing and illustrating 50 books, I made the timeline for this project 3 years. <i>Most</i> of that time will be spent creating these children's books. Please help promote literacy by helping me create this series of books about each state that children can learn from and interact with.  There are rewards offered for making a donation to the campaign. I tried really hard to make the rewards appealing and to fit this project.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Our funding goal is $75,000.  This includes:</p>
<p>1) Travel accommodations/food. (I plan to keep this expense as low as possible by staying with friends and family as we travel through different states.</p>
<p>2) Road Trip (automotive expenses/ fuel). Molly and I plan to drive my car as we travel through all 50 states, except for Hawaii. We want to travel by car so we can stop, meet and talk to people on our journey.</p>
<p>3) Photography related equipment (filters, SD cards, etc.) I have professional equipment; however, there might be locations that require special gear. </p>
<p>4) Publishing and rewards costs (includes publishing expenses, ISBN numbers (for 50 books), printing costs, and money to buy the rewards).</p>
<p>5) Misc. expenses (includes things that are unexpected, like vehicle breakdowns, unanticipated travel expenses, etc...)</p>
<p>$75,000 sounds like a lot of money (even to me), but when we break it down, it is definitely doable. We need only 15,000 people to donate $5.00 each or 7,500 people to donate $10.00 each to reach our goal. That doesn't sound near so bad, huh?</p>
<h3><strong>Unique Perks (What you get)</strong></h3>
<p>I tried hard to make the rewards fun. Here are some of our unique reward perks:</p>
<p>For $100 donation, you can sign Molly's state bandana. I made Molly a yellow bandana with all the states on it to wear on our trip. The photo of her wearing the bandana will be on the front or back cover of the books WITH YOUR SIGNATURE if you choose this reward.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554939983/bpzhqh1hbipywnp6dhzp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>$500 reward- For a $500 donation, you will get a MEET &amp; GREET with Miss Molly. We will meet you in your state and take your photo with Molly. Molly loves people and she will love to meet you... IF you choose this reward.</p>
<p>$750 reward- For a $750 donation, you will get to SPEND THE DAY WITH MOLLY &amp; I as we travel through your state. You can personally show us places we need to photograph for our books IF you choose this reward.</p>
<p>$5000 reward- For a $5000 donation, you will get THE WHOLE SET OF 50 BOOKS. WOW!! This reward would be great for a school, a daycare, etc...</p>
<p>These are just a few of the unique rewards. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With this project, our aim is to promote literacy, instill a sense of adventure in the kids that read these books and most of all, to entice them to read... and have fun reading about our great country and the places they could travel to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Sample Book Cover and Pages </h3>
<p>These are not actual book pages and the book cover, but just samples of what the book pages and cover will look like. The books will be soft cover with perfect binding. Each book will have the title of the state on the cover.</p>
<p>Sample Book Cover:</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is a huge project- a three-year project. There are a lot of things that can go wrong and we know this, but there are also a lot of things that can go right... and we expect this. We have talked to family and friends who live in different states across the U.S. and are prepared to reach out to them if we have troubles. We plan to divide these 50 states into several trips and will take one trip at a time, planned out so we know exactly where we are going. </p>
<p>For the books, I have previously published children's books and know how to create book pages, templates, etc... for the books. My degree is in photography so I don't expect to have any trouble with the photos that I will take for the books. I don't anticipate too many problems in creating the books. I plan to create the book for a particular state after visiting that state. If you donate and request a certain state book, after I visit that state and create the book, I will send you the reward (the book). You won't have to wait 3 years for the books, unless you are getting the whole set.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are several ways you can help us. First, of course, is to choose a reward and donate. A second way you can help is by sharing this project on your social media sites with your friends and family and then asking them to share it too. A lot of hands makes light work... and a lot of people will help make this project come to life.</p>
<h3>Updates</h3>
<p>I plan to keep backers who have donated to this project updated weekly on our travel blog. I will also send a personal e-mail once a month to let you know where we have been, what books we have written or are currently working on, what our future travel plans are and when you can expect the rewards. If anything changes in our initial plan, I will update you about the change. I will post photos of our travels through different states so you can follow us on this journey.</p>
<h3>Stretch Rewards</h3>
<p><i>IF we make our funding goal of $75,000, our campaign will stay live on Indemand and we will offer stretch rewards for people who donate after our goal is met. The stretch rewards will be your choice of 1 state book and a donation from Candy and Molly to abandoned and mistreated pug organizations.</i></p>
<h3>Our Team</h3>
<p>Our team consists mostly of Molly and I. I do have other team members that help behind the scenes, but Molly and I will be the ones traveling and writing these books. We started this book writing adventure several years ago but this will be our biggest project yet. Molly just turned 7 years old and is in excellent health. She loves to travel and meet people and she is a pro when it comes to posing for photos. Here's a photo of me and Miss Molly this last December. We hope to see you on our journey!!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
DID YOU KNOW??
37% of children arrive at kindergarten without the skills necessary for lifetime learning. (Landry, S. H. (2005). Effective Early Childhood Programs: Turning Knowledge Into Action. Houston, TX: University of Texas, Health Science Center at Houston).
AND
1 in 4 children in America grow up without learning how to read. (WriteExpress Corporation. ""Literacy Statistics."" Begin to Read. Accessed April 16, 2014).
WOW!! I was shocked when I read these statistics!! As a journalist, I see the consequences of people who are unable to read and write proficiently everyday. As a mother, I am concerned about my children and my children's children and want them to have every possible opportunity to be successful in their lifetimes... and that means they need great reading and writing skills.
A lady who teaches the fourth grade at a Kansas school told me a few months ago that the schools have quit teaching English skills. This shocked me and at the same time, saddens me. Without basic English skills, our children are going struggle to complete tasks that require those basic skills.
  Hi!! My name is Candy Johansen. I’ve been in graduate school at Kansas State University for the last 4 semesters.  Before I started graduate school, as a undergraduate student at The University of Kansas, I wrote a series of 5 children’s books with Miss Molly (my pug) as the star of the books.
The reason I started writing the books came from Molly herself. Molly loves children and loves to interact with them. One day while watching her interact with a group of kids, I decided I wanted to write children’s learning books and let her be the star (in other words, let the children connect with her through the books).
Shortly after starting graduate school, I was talking with one of my professors about a thesis subject. I told him about the children’s books I had written and he was extremely interested. He prompted me to tell him more and I told him I was interested in creating more of these books. I told him I would like to travel to all 50 states and write a children’s travel book about each state. He encouraged me to use this idea for my graduate project… and then pursue it. That’s how the project came to be.
My goal is to make these books educational, but fun at the same time. I don’t want them to replicate an encyclopedia type book- I want kids to be engaged and interested- and want to read them. I plan to include some history of each state, famous people who were born, lived in or currently live in the state, landmarks, interesting places in that state, state foods, and fun things to do and see. The books will have space for children to include their own memorabilia when they visit the states themselves. The U.S. Department of Education found that generally the more students read for fun on their own time, the higher their reading scores.
I have a degree in photography, so I plan to take all the photos that we will put in the books. Nothing would make us happier than to have a child laugh as they learn and then be inspired to want to visit each state. Imagine the stories they will tell!!
Our aim is to promote literacy and instill a sense of adventure in our youth. I want to do my part in helping children develop good reading and writing skills.
If solid reading skills aren't formed during a child's early years, the odds of dropping out down the road increase significantly. Kids who aren't successfully reading at grade level by the third grade are four times less likely to finish high school.
We are using Molly as our mascot to keep things fun for the kids… and we know that kids relate well to dogs. As an added treat, we hope to meet other pug and dog enthusiasts during our travels. I have met so many wonderful pug and other dog owners through social media and we would love to be able to stop and say “hi” while traveling through your state.  We look forward to making many new friends in new places. And… if you want, you can even be a part of our adventure!
We DO need your help!  It’s going to take a lot of money to do this 50 states project… and to print all the books. As any author knows, writing a book is challenging and time consuming. There are 50 books in this series- one book for each state. Since I'll be writing and illustrating 50 books, I made the timeline for this project 3 years. Most of that time will be spent creating these children's books. Please help promote literacy by helping me create this series of books about each state that children can learn from and interact with.  There are rewards offered for making a donation to the campaign. I tried really hard to make the rewards appealing and to fit this project.
 

What We Need 
Our funding goal is $75,000.  This includes:
1) Travel accommodations/food. (I plan to keep this expense as low as possible by staying with friends and family as we travel through different states.
2) Road Trip (automotive expenses/ fuel). Molly and I plan to drive my car as we travel through all 50 states, except for Hawaii. We want to travel by car so we can stop, meet and talk to people on our journey.
3) Photography related equipment (filters, SD cards, etc.) I have professional equipment; however, there might be locations that require special gear. 
4) Publishing and rewards costs (includes publishing expenses, ISBN numbers (for 50 books), printing costs, and money to buy the rewards).
5) Misc. expenses (includes things that are unexpected, like vehicle breakdowns, unanticipated travel expenses, etc...)
$75,000 sounds like a lot of money (even to me), but when we break it down, it is definitely doable. We need only 15,000 people to donate $5.00 each or 7,500 people to donate $10.00 each to reach our goal. That doesn't sound near so bad, huh?
Unique Perks (What you get)
I tried hard to make the rewards fun. Here are some of our unique reward perks:
For $100 donation, you can sign Molly's state bandana. I made Molly a yellow bandana with all the states on it to wear on our trip. The photo of her wearing the bandana will be on the front or back cover of the books WITH YOUR SIGNATURE if you choose this reward.

$500 reward- For a $500 donation, you will get a MEET & GREET with Miss Molly. We will meet you in your state and take your photo with Molly. Molly loves people and she will love to meet you... IF you choose this reward.
$750 reward- For a $750 donation, you will get to SPEND THE DAY WITH MOLLY & I as we travel through your state. You can personally show us places we need to photograph for our books IF you choose this reward.
$5000 reward- For a $5000 donation, you will get THE WHOLE SET OF 50 BOOKS. WOW!! This reward would be great for a school, a daycare, etc...
These are just a few of the unique rewards. 

The Impact
With this project, our aim is to promote literacy, instill a sense of adventure in the kids that read these books and most of all, to entice them to read... and have fun reading about our great country and the places they could travel to.
 
 
Sample Book Cover and Pages 
These are not actual book pages and the book cover, but just samples of what the book pages and cover will look like. The books will be soft cover with perfect binding. Each book will have the title of the state on the cover.

Risks & Challenges
This is a huge project- a three-year project. There are a lot of things that can go wrong and we know this, but there are also a lot of things that can go right... and we expect this. We have talked to family and friends who live in different states across the U.S. and are prepared to reach out to them if we have troubles. We plan to divide these 50 states into several trips and will take one trip at a time, planned out so we know exactly where we are going. 
For the books, I have previously published children's books and know how to create book pages, templates, etc... for the books. My degree is in photography so I don't expect to have any trouble with the photos that I will take for the books. I don't anticipate too many problems in creating the books. I plan to create the book for a particular state after visiting that state. If you donate and request a certain state book, after I visit that state and create the book, I will send you the reward (the book). You won't have to wait 3 years for the books, unless you are getting the whole set.

Other Ways You Can Help
There are several ways you can help us. First, of course, is to choose a reward and donate. A second way you can help is by sharing this project on your social media sites with your friends and family and then asking them to share it too. A lot of hands makes light work... and a lot of people will help make this project come to life.
Updates
I plan to keep backers who have donated to this project updated weekly on our travel blog. I will also send a personal e-mail once a month to let you know where we have been, what books we have written or are currently working on, what our future travel plans are and when you can expect the rewards. If anything changes in our initial plan, I will update you about the change. I will post photos of our travels through different states so you can follow us on this journey.
Stretch Rewards
IF we make our funding goal of $75,000, our campaign will stay live on Indemand and we will offer stretch rewards for people who donate after our goal is met. The stretch rewards will be your choice of 1 state book and a donation from Candy and Molly to abandoned and mistreated pug organizations.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>More about myself (Edward van der Merwe):</strong></p>
<p>I am an Engineer by trade, currently completing my maters studies in Industrial Engineering at the University of Stellenbosch. My passion is trail running and spending time in the mountains. I am passionate about social change (especially children), and not just change for the sake of change, but rather sustainable change where individuals and communities experience lasting change. My desire is for people to become the individuals they are meant to be, to step out of the place of fear, to be obedient to the Word of God and the Holy Spirit and to develop and follow Godly desires in those places where they are called to.  </p>
<p><strong>The Campaign</strong></p>
<p>We will raise funds for the One Child, One Backpack initiative towards better education for the children of Semonkong, a little village in Lesotho. This forms part of the bigger mission of the Semonkong Hospital Trust (NGO). On the last weekend of October will we embark on an adventure called the Jonkershoek Transverse. This is a route summiting seven peaks in the Jonkershoek Mountains, near Stellenbosch; the route is just over 30-kilometres in distance with 3,000-metres of elevation gain. There is a rich history to the route, with the earliest attempt recorded in 1963, with the current record standing at 8h 35 min, just indicating the extreme terrain of the route.</p>
<p>The children of Semonkong are in many ways disadvantaged - one of the needs we identified in their lives is the lack of school material. Many schools have no paper or books for the children to write in, let alone a pencil or pen to write with.  The teachers have very limited resources to conduct their classes with, as this is a very rural environment.  Our hearts desire is to fill this gap and provide every child with the opportunity to learn and develop as much as possible in school. Some of the children walk long distances to school. As a team, we would like to raise enough funds to put together a small backpack with a water bottle, lunch box, pencil case, pencil &amp; eraser, crayons and colour pencils.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>You have the opportunity to become part of this vision 'One Child, One Backpack' by equipping every child with his/her own backpack filled with the above items. The price of the backpack, including all the items, will amount to $14 per backpack. We are ministering to approximately a 1000 children, including orphans, through our various efforts of our children's ministry.</p>
<p><strong>The Backpack: </strong></p>
<p>The Backpack will contain a water bottle, lunch box, pencil case, pencil &amp; eraser, crayons and colour pencils.</p>

<ul><li>$13000</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Semonkong Hospital Trust is a faith-based, interdenominational, non-profit organisation. The Trust has been implementing a holistic sustainable community development programme since 2005. Our main aim is to erect one of the very first eco-friendly, financially self-sustainable hospitals in the world. The hospital will be built in Semonkong, a town in the central mountain-region of Lesotho. Lesotho is a tiny country in Southern Africa completely landlocked within South Africa. We support the community by sending mission teams on a regular basis to Semonkong. The next multi-disciplinary team will go to Semonkong from 25 November – 7 December and will consist of medical, agricultural, maintenance, children’s ministry, evangelism and bicycle teams.</p>
<p>The One Child One Backpack initiative forms part of the bigger project and will contribute as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give the children the essentials to learn in class.</li>
<li>Education is most crucial at an early stage of a child’s development process, and this will enable learning to take place.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Only a quarter of the Jonkershoek Transverse route follows established paths that demands lots of navigational and mountaineering skills to complete. It also requires many scouting trips, not only to familiarise oneself with the route, which in sections is only marked by strategic cairns, but also with the various escape routes. There is no official route description, although most of the route can be deciphered from the individual descriptions offered in “Jonkershoek en sy berge”. It is definitely not for the faint-hearted and few people have done it more than once since the effort has been compared to that of an Ironman event. As always, there are those for whom the challenge is simply irresistible. - As listed on the website FEAT (Fascinating Expedition and Adventure Talks)</p>

Some are lucky to visit a few aquariums, but many just got to see several pictures of the deep seas in a couple lessons during primary and high school. We have an ambitious but realistic goal: To make ocean exploration for everyone.  You probably can't afford expensive equipment for a real dive into the ocean, but it's high likely you can be connected to a good internet. Our team, Aalto Explorer, started from a university project, at Aalto University, envisions a remote vehicle and a network application – the so-called expedition platform – to be controlled by the community and be made available to any ocean-enthusiasts, casual explorers and life-long learners, sending them on exciting journeys of oceanic exploration on their own terms and at their own pace. A team of more than 15 people from multi-disciplines have worked on a voluntary basis for the last two years, to finally produce the third prototype with game-changing features. Dive in our story below for more. We are here, on Indiegogo to day to bring this further to life. We want to build more of the AE system to deploy around the world, so you can learn about our oceans, experience their wonder, right at where you are.   Aalto Explorer is a seamless underwater technology network that makes ocean exploration more accessible and affordable than ever - for you, your friends and family from wherever you are with a working internet connection.The system consists of 3 components working together in harmony:
Find-X, the Underwater Drone  
Floating Module, anchor, communication and power support to Find-X  
Aalto Explorer expedition platform, where you access and control the drone through the Internet.
 The community and/or experts can organize and book an expedition on one of the FIND-X units deployed around the world.   Take a Demo ride with us as a PASSENGER to get a hang of it: Click at the button below and fill in the Demo's code: PAS1234 Aalto Explorer is not just a drone, it is a community of explorers from all around the world who can plan the expeditions and lead them through Aalto Explorer platform. You can join whether you are a researcher and would like to have a realtime data without leaving the lab. Or you can be the one in control, having thousands of people following your expedition. You can be learning new diving areas, searching for the shipwrecks or just exploring the ocean.There is a number of possible applications. ​ Aalto Explorer at World Oceans Day, held at Oodi Central Library, Helsinki. No longer is the need for purchasing costly underwater drones and submarines or taking an exorbitant diving trip. The deep sea is within your reach. Aalto Explorer is an underwater network that enables you to explore the ocean right on your device.    FEATURES:
Operate at least 50m of  depth
Use thrusters for movement, allowing six degrees of freedom. Include one 360° Full HD or 4K livestream video camera with VR function.
One or two additional Full HD or 4K video cameras can be added if needed for navigation.

<p><strong>Aloades Ecosystem </strong></p>
<p>Dear friends,</p>
<p>We are <strong>Dimitris and Evi</strong>, a couple of olive growers from Central Greece at the foot of Mount Ossa. For many years we had been living and working in the city, at desk jobs, away from anything that had to do with nature.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558607530/oorpep3gwcuqzrigxpto.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>So, during the years of the crisis, we thought to turn to something that we have loved since we were kids, the <strong>cultivation</strong> of olive trees. We want to continue what we had as recourse when we were kids. A big part of our childhood memories comes from the cultivation of olive trees. The generation of our fathers may be gone in a few years but the generation of our children is already here. Therefore, we need to act as a bridge between what is leaving, what we are and what we will leave.</p>
<p>Staring out at the horizon of the slopes of Ossa with the forms of the <strong>Aloades</strong>, the mythical giants, whose legend we were scared of when we were kids, we are starting the revival of our estate. We take daily care of our trees, our old stone oil press, our stone-built courtyard, trying to do everything as it was done in the past. We produced our own <strong>olive oil </strong>from the sunny part of the estate, full of aromas and light. We planted new trees, we took care of the old wild olive trees and we paved the way so that our olive oil becomes known outside of Greece. We are now planning the complete revival of our farm and we are inviting every one of you so that we can create together our own traditional <strong>ecosystem</strong>.</p>
<p>We know how to cultivate the olive trees, how to weave baskets to pick the olives, to create pots to store our precious olive oil. We make soaps based on olive oil and wild herbs that grow in our <strong>farm</strong>. We have a vision to offer you a biodynamic, <strong>ecological</strong>, traditional ecosystem, full of outdoor activities, aromas of herbs, flavours of olive oil, <strong>traditional</strong> constructions in the shadow of the mythical giants Aloades.</p>
<p>We do believe in all people’s assistance in saving forgotten arts, traditional cultivation methods, cooking recipes by making our ecosystem a place of revival of all these. Our ecological ecosystem will be free of any chemical or plastic non-recyclable material and its main orientation will be the aid in the study of the olive trees in the fight against the climate change that has started to appear in the Mediterranean basin as well.</p>
<p>With your help, our ecosystem will offer to every visitor, with priority given to kids and young people, contact with <strong>nature</strong>, ecology, the Mediterranean diet, the cultivation of olive trees and all activities surrounding it. We are open to any proposal that would improve the activities and the actions of our ecosystem. We will immediately focus in working with ecosystems of corresponding orientation all around the world, with love for natural life, the mankind, the environment, forgotten cottage industries and the maintenance of a sustainable planet.</p>

Dear friends,

So, during the years of the crisis, we thought to turn to something that we have loved since we were kids, the cultivation of olive trees.

The generation of our fathers may be gone in a few years but the generation of our children is already here. Therefore, we need to act as a bridge between what is leaving, what we are and what we will leave.
Staring out at the horizon of the slopes of Ossa with the forms of the Aloades, the mythical giants, whose legend we were scared of when we were kids, we are starting the revival of our estate. We take daily care of our trees, our old stone oil press, our stone-built courtyard, trying to do everything as it was done in the past. We produced our own olive oil from the sunny part of the estate, full of aromas and light. We planted new trees, we took care of the old wild olive trees and we paved the way so that our olive oil becomes known outside of Greece. We are now planning the complete revival of our farm and we are inviting every one of you so that we can create together our own traditional ecosystem.
We know how to cultivate the olive trees, how to weave baskets to pick the olives, to create pots to store our precious olive oil. We make soaps based on olive oil and wild herbs that grow in our farm. We have a vision to offer you a biodynamic, ecological, traditional ecosystem, full of outdoor activities, aromas of herbs, flavours of olive oil, traditional constructions in the shadow of the mythical giants Aloades.
We do believe in all people’s assistance in saving forgotten arts, traditional cultivation methods, cooking recipes by making our ecosystem a place of revival of all these. Our ecological ecosystem will be free of any chemical or plastic non-recyclable material and its main orientation will be the aid in the study of the olive trees in the fight against the climate change that has started to appear in the Mediterranean basin as well.
With your help, our ecosystem will offer to every visitor, with priority given to kids and young people, contact with nature, ecology, the Mediterranean diet, the cultivation of olive trees and all activities surrounding it. We are open to any proposal that would improve the activities and the actions of our ecosystem. We will immediately focus in working with ecosystems of corresponding orientation all around the world, with love for natural life, the mankind, the environment, forgotten cottage industries and the maintenance of a sustainable planet.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Recently, high school students are applying to more and more colleges at a time. We believe that treating college applications as a number game is counterproductive. Admissions officers like applicants who understand and fit the campus culture. Shadowing a current college student through her typical day on campus offers valuable insight into fit and campus culture. Our founders have personally been asked by family members and friends to show them around campus. Now we want to expand this opportunity to more people, so that everyone, even those not as well-connected, can preview college life firsthand through our 1-on-1 immersive tours.</p>

<p><i><b>Life
Lessons Project – Lesson 2: Finding Your Passion &amp; Purpose.</b></i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Most
of us go through life in a fog  or without any direction trying to
make sense of it all by trial and error, following societal norms, or
are given a path not of our choosing.  For most of us, Life
chooses where we go instead of us choosing where we want, need, or
should go.  This all stems from the confusion that comes from
not knowing who we
are or what motivates us. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Many
settle for whatever that comes their way, rather than pursuing well
thought out goals based on self-realization of  they're choices,
values, or needs.  They end up feeling that life has no meaning,
satisfaction, purpose.  Which leads them to feel trapped,
de-motivated, and without any drive to live up to their full
potential.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
We
all eventually make this self discovery but for most this self
discovery comes too late to have any meaningful impact in their life
or legacy.  The precious little time we all get is consumed by
discovery instead of action, achievement, or in pursuit of our full
development.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
With
your help, I aim to streamline and prioritize the discovery stage to
assist the reader figure out, on their own terms who they are and who
they want to be.  Where they are and where they should be going. 
Proper assessment in this stage can have immense benefits to an
individual's life giving lasting meaning and contentment as well as
benefiting all of humanity.</p>

</p>
<p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Meet Robert Jakus and Read a Brief Summary of this '<i>Beyond the Classroom Aquarium'</i> Professional Development Workshop Fundraising Campaign for Educators</h3>
<p>Hello. Thank you for visiting this campaign. I have been an educator since 1978. My efforts to develop an engaging curricular sequence of project-based, STEM-Oriented and aquatic ecosystem themed learning activities has occupied much of my time since the early 1990's. I was only able to complete this work in December, 2014 after taking the opportunity to retire from teaching. I call the curricular sequence <i>Beyond the Classroom Aquarium</i>. It is designed to help teachers guide their students through an unimaginable sequence of project based, aquatic ecosys-STEM themed learning activities that transcend traditional classroom aquarium experience - by far - thus ""Beyond"" is a key word in the title.</p>
<p>I wrote <i>Beyond the Classroom Aquarium, in part, as a response to questions</i> numerous educational colleagues asked me about various aquarium systems in my classrooms and also, in part, as a reaction to the enthusiasm and natural spirit of exploration and wonder these ecosystems inspired in students - throughout the school. My goal with this campaign is to gain the opportunity to offer pre-service and in-service educators an intensive professional development workshop that condenses the curricular sequence of project based, STEAM-Oriented and aquatic ecosystem themed projects and pedagogical processes in <i>Beyond the Classroom Aquarium</i> into a one week experience.</p>
<p>Monies that this <i>Beyond the Classroom Aquarium</i> - PD Learning Space/Lab fundraising campaign generate will provide for the set up of a well-stocked, state-of-the-art demo lab/classroom specifically designed to emphasize all aspects of the aquatic ecosystem design, assembly and management project path that educators and their students may experience throughout a school year. A successful <i>Beyond the Classroom Aquarium</i> fundraising campaign will literally bring this book to life for educators and their students. Participation in this workshop involves a lot of collaborative hands-on design work, modeling, and ecosystem assembly activities. Participants will explore ways their students will be able to fit these projects to the footprint of their own classroom/learning space.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Description of funds and resources needed in order to provide a Beyond the Classroom Aquarium PD workshop &amp; what PD participants get</h3>
<p>This fundraising campaign requires $225,000. Costs include: PD staff, (as guides, assistants. &amp; technicians), class-space and/or building and utilities, materials necessary to fabricate and assemble aquatic ecosystem projects, various aquatic ecosystem monitoring technologies, materials &amp; equipment to collect &amp; share data &amp; integrate project work across the curriculum, a used vehicle to haul equipment, insurance for PD participants while on-site, office equipment, furniture, program ""swag"" for donors, and resource takeaways for PD workshop participants. Funds will not cover transportation to/from the workshop destination. Funds raised will also cover single occupancy lodging for PD workshop participants (5 nights) with complimentary breakfast bar and working lunch meals &amp; snacks during the workshop. Funds will not cover evening meals/dinner. A portion of the received fund will also be provided to do a program follow up site visit to evaluate PD participant implementation of workshop projects with their own students &amp; learning spaces. Finally, funds received will also be used to hire an outside program evaluator who will collect and analyze program data and make it available as unbiased evidence of this professional development program's value for consideration for funding from federal and state educational funding agencies.</p>
<p>Funds raised in this campaign will be used to guide participants of week long PD sessions to set up a fully functioning <i>Beyond the Classroom Aquarium</i> work space, displaying all 14 <i>Beyond the Classroom Aquarium</i> projects in operation - as their students may be guided to do - by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing PD workshop participants (in respective teams) to collaborative group work design critique processes and decision making.</li>
<li>Providing technical support to PD workshop teams to expedite design and assembly of all <i>Beyond the Classroom Aquarium</i> aquatic ecosystem projects.</li>
<li>Providing materials and equipment necessary for design, assembly, and operation of <i>Beyond the Classroom Aquarium</i> aquatic ecosystem projects.</li>
<li>Providing materials, equipment and support to introduce workshop participants to the personalized integration of technology, engineering, math, and arts into each project</li>
<li>Guiding PD workshop participants in processes of using experiences from designing, assembling, and operating classroom aquatic ecosystems to design an aquatic ecosystem themed scientific investigation (experimental design &amp; execution)</li>
<li>Introducing workshop participants to various ""beyond the classroom"" aquatic ecosystem themed issues that might be of particular interest to students as they design and implement a service learning project</li>
<li>Exploring advanced hi-tech aquatic ecosystem themed project designs for students to report upon and/or actually design/prototype/develop</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Beyond the Classroom Aquarium</i> perks are available for a range of donation levels. Every consideration is deeply appreciated. Perks provided to donors who help meet the financial target include: a song-download conveying the story of the reversal of the flow of the Chicago River and describing the issue of ""Clean Water;"" <i>Beyond the Classroom Aquarium</i> hot/cold cups; additional <i>Beyond the Classroom Aquarium</i> paraphernalia including: canvas bags, golf shirts, colored beach towels, caps, copies of <i>Beyond the Classroom Aquarium</i>, and reserved professional development workshop registration and lodging (for individuals or groups of up to twelve).</p>
<p>If this campaign does not reach the published goal of $225,000 all donations will be returned.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>Beyond the Classroom Aquarium</i> is my personal contribution to the expanding nationwide effort to transform public education for students, teachers, and communities. It is a grassroots effort that I designed over a period of twenty-two years. This campaign represents my effort to share this curriculum with educational colleagues and students. The projects are eminently worthwhile, engaging, authentic and fun-filled. Yet as a grassroots effort, each project and activity within this curriculum celebrates the spirit of uniqueness that characterizes every individual educator who is as well prepared to express compassion for each student as he/she does for their subject/content. In the book and workshop, educators are encouraged to modify project activities to best meet the needs of their students. And educators are trusted to be capable of knowing their students well enough to make such decisions. Many contributors to this <i>Beyond the Classroom Aquarium</i> campaign may well be supporting ""old-school"" educational sensibilities that require implicit trust of and respect for educators. At times, some might find <i>Beyond the Classroom Aquarium</i> a bit complicated while many will acclaim that this curricular sequence of STEAM-Oriented and aquatic ecosystem themed projects might also be what is best for numerous students, teachers, and communities. Public education is as important today as ever and some contributors to <i>Beyond the Classroom Aquarium</i> may make a contribution to support the pedagogical voice and vision presented in the book/workshop. </p>
<p>Many educators are searching for professional development opportunities like this (for their students sake)! Some organizations are beginning to promote the idea that educators should be in charge of their own professional development choices and voices. Beyond the Classroom Aquarium could well be a good fit for many - in the service of our children, their parents and society.</p>
<p>The potential environmental impact of this sequence of projects is also substantial. These projects are also designed to transform students into environmental stewards.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risks and obstacles I may face on the way to expanding my ability to share this curricular sequence of learning projects with colleagues and students on a large scale might arise from my need to compete with large national and/or corporate professional development providers.</p>
<p>My experience as an educator, my work with colleagues, my enjoyment in seeing students learn and care, and my belief in the value of this book/workshop qualify me to overcome these hurdles.</p>
<p>In addition to being able to obtain all necessary support staff, work space, and materials, this campaign seeks funding that will also be sufficient to allow for the hiring of an impartial program evaluator. This evaluator will collect and analyze program data and make it available as unbiased evidence of this professional development program's value for consideration for funding from federal and state educational funding agencies.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I am fully aware that some people just can't contribute financially to this campaign.

</div></div>","Meet Robert Jakus and Read a Brief Summary of this 'Beyond the Classroom Aquarium' Professional Development Workshop Fundraising Campaign for Educators
Hello. Thank you for visiting this campaign. I have been an educator since 1978. My efforts to develop an engaging curricular sequence of project-based, STEM-Oriented and aquatic ecosystem themed learning activities has occupied much of my time since the early 1990's. I was only able to complete this work in December, 2014 after taking the opportunity to retire from teaching. I call the curricular sequence Beyond the Classroom Aquarium. It is designed to help teachers guide their students through an unimaginable sequence of project based, aquatic ecosys-STEM themed learning activities that transcend traditional classroom aquarium experience - by far - thus ""Beyond"" is a key word in the title.
I wrote Beyond the Classroom Aquarium, in part, as a response to questions numerous educational colleagues asked me about various aquarium systems in my classrooms and also, in part, as a reaction to the enthusiasm and natural spirit of exploration and wonder these ecosystems inspired in students - throughout the school. My goal with this campaign is to gain the opportunity to offer pre-service and in-service educators an intensive professional development workshop that condenses the curricular sequence of project based, STEAM-Oriented and aquatic ecosystem themed projects and pedagogical processes in Beyond the Classroom Aquarium into a one week experience.
Monies that this Beyond the Classroom Aquarium - PD Learning Space/Lab fundraising campaign generate will provide for the set up of a well-stocked, state-of-the-art demo lab/classroom specifically designed to emphasize all aspects of the aquatic ecosystem design, assembly and management project path that educators and their students may experience throughout a school year. A successful Beyond the Classroom Aquarium fundraising campaign will literally bring this book to life for educators and their students. Participation in this workshop involves a lot of collaborative hands-on design work, modeling, and ecosystem assembly activities. Participants will explore ways their students will be able to fit these projects to the footprint of their own classroom/learning space.

Description of funds and resources needed in order to provide a Beyond the Classroom Aquarium PD workshop & what PD participants get
This fundraising campaign requires $225,000. Costs include: PD staff, (as guides, assistants. & technicians), class-space and/or building and utilities, materials necessary to fabricate and assemble aquatic ecosystem projects, various aquatic ecosystem monitoring technologies, materials & equipment to collect & share data & integrate project work across the curriculum, a used vehicle to haul equipment, insurance for PD participants while on-site, office equipment, furniture, program ""swag"" for donors, and resource takeaways for PD workshop participants. Funds will not cover transportation to/from the workshop destination. Funds raised will also cover single occupancy lodging for PD workshop participants (5 nights) with complimentary breakfast bar and working lunch meals & snacks during the workshop. Funds will not cover evening meals/dinner. A portion of the received fund will also be provided to do a program follow up site visit to evaluate PD participant implementation of workshop projects with their own students & learning spaces. Finally, funds received will also be used to hire an outside program evaluator who will collect and analyze program data and make it available as unbiased evidence of this professional development program's value for consideration for funding from federal and state educational funding agencies.
Funds raised in this campaign will be used to guide participants of week long PD sessions to set up a fully functioning Beyond the Classroom Aquarium work space, displaying all 14 Beyond the Classroom Aquarium projects in operation - as their students may be guided to do - by:

Introducing PD workshop participants (in respective teams) to collaborative group work design critique processes and decision making.
Providing technical support to PD workshop teams to expedite design and assembly of all Beyond the Classroom Aquarium aquatic ecosystem projects.
Providing materials and equipment necessary for design, assembly, and operation of Beyond the Classroom Aquarium aquatic ecosystem projects.
Providing materials, equipment and support to introduce workshop participants to the personalized integration of technology, engineering, math, and arts into each project
Guiding PD workshop participants in processes of using experiences from designing, assembling, and operating classroom aquatic ecosystems to design an aquatic ecosystem themed scientific investigation (experimental design & execution)
Introducing workshop participants to various ""beyond the classroom"" aquatic ecosystem themed issues that might be of particular interest to students as they design and implement a service learning project
Exploring advanced hi-tech aquatic ecosystem themed project designs for students to report upon and/or actually design/prototype/develop

Beyond the Classroom Aquarium perks are available for a range of donation levels. Every consideration is deeply appreciated. Perks provided to donors who help meet the financial target include: a song-download conveying the story of the reversal of the flow of the Chicago River and describing the issue of ""Clean Water;"" Beyond the Classroom Aquarium hot/cold cups; additional Beyond the Classroom Aquarium paraphernalia including: canvas bags, golf shirts, colored beach towels, caps, copies of Beyond the Classroom Aquarium, and reserved professional development workshop registration and lodging (for individuals or groups of up to twelve).
If this campaign does not reach the published goal of $225,000 all donations will be returned.

The Impact
Beyond the Classroom Aquarium is my personal contribution to the expanding nationwide effort to transform public education for students, teachers, and communities. It is a grassroots effort that I designed over a period of twenty-two years. This campaign represents my effort to share this curriculum with educational colleagues and students. The projects are eminently worthwhile, engaging, authentic and fun-filled. Yet as a grassroots effort, each project and activity within this curriculum celebrates the spirit of uniqueness that characterizes every individual educator who is as well prepared to express compassion for each student as he/she does for their subject/content. In the book and workshop, educators are encouraged to modify project activities to best meet the needs of their students. And educators are trusted to be capable of knowing their students well enough to make such decisions. Many contributors to this Beyond the Classroom Aquarium campaign may well be supporting ""old-school"" educational sensibilities that require implicit trust of and respect for educators. At times, some might find Beyond the Classroom Aquarium a bit complicated while many will acclaim that this curricular sequence of STEAM-Oriented and aquatic ecosystem themed projects might also be what is best for numerous students, teachers, and communities. Public education is as important today as ever and some contributors to Beyond the Classroom Aquarium may make a contribution to support the pedagogical voice and vision presented in the book/workshop. 
Many educators are searching for professional development opportunities like this (for their students sake)! Some organizations are beginning to promote the idea that educators should be in charge of their own professional development choices and voices. Beyond the Classroom Aquarium could well be a good fit for many - in the service of our children, their parents and society.
The potential environmental impact of this sequence of projects is also substantial. These projects are also designed to transform students into environmental stewards.

Risks & Challenges
Risks and obstacles I may face on the way to expanding my ability to share this curricular sequence of learning projects with colleagues and students on a large scale might arise from my need to compete with large national and/or corporate professional development providers.
My experience as an educator, my work with colleagues, my enjoyment in seeing students learn and care, and my belief in the value of this book/workshop qualify me to overcome these hurdles.
In addition to being able to obtain all necessary support staff, work space, and materials, this campaign seeks funding that will also be sufficient to allow for the hiring of an impartial program evaluator. This evaluator will collect and analyze program data and make it available as unbiased evidence of this professional development program's value for consideration for funding from federal and state educational funding agencies.

Other Ways You Can Help
I am fully aware that some people just can't contribute financially to this campaign. But I am equally grateful to everyone who helps this campaign reach its fundraising goal whether they personally contribute money or not. If you would like to support this campaign but cannot contribute financially please share your ideas about this program so that others might take note - and contribute.

<p><b>Introducing… </b></p>
<p><b>The Create Your World Healing Arts Center</b></p>
<p><b>The first of it’s kind, creative arts based live-in community for young adults </b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Hello, my name is Kelli Vissers, and I am here to tell you about a very unique community that I am building. The “Create Your World Creative Arts Community”, is posed to be the first live-in community of it’s kind for low to middle income young adults ages 18-22 who would like to embrace and nurture their passion for the arts.  With school art and music programs being limited or cut more than ever before, it is imperative that we come together to find alternatives for disadvantaged young adults interested in pursuing careers in art, music, theatre and dance after high school.  My goal is not only to help young adults find and embrace their passion and their voice, but to give them a head start in life.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Create Your World Community is a beautiful concept that will provide young adults with a safe, judgement free environment where they can immerse themselves into the activities that feed their soul. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>But that's not all…</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Members of the community will be given a tiny home that they will be able to take with them when they leave the community, provided that they help maintain and work in the community during their stay. Tiny home stays will typically run anywhere from 6-12 months and will be determined during the application process and adjusted for individual needs.  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to reach like-minded people for collaboration, raise money and to spread the word about the importance of supporting our young people.  It is my hope that I will be able to open small communities in cities across the country.  So, I ask you to please spread the word.  Talk about it, provide me with your input, and please get involved!</p>

<p><i>A Quote from our Founder: I have a dream. A dream of a place where being unique is encouraged, embraced and nurtured. A place where you can come to express the gifts of your soul and experience true, deep emotional healing in a way that is not normally acknowledged in our society. I truly believe that self-healing begins with the freedom of self-expression, and to truly practice self-expression, you must have a vehicle to present it to the world. The Create Your World Tiny Home Community was created to be a sacred, nonjudgmental community where under-privileged young adults can get a head start in life by engaging in activities they love, all while learning how to be self-sufficient entrepreneurs. As a reward, we give them their first home, which we believe, will give them both a head start and a brighter future.  </i></p>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>KloudMagica is a unique, live and interactive e-learning platform that is redefining professional e-learning. Our purpose is to bridge the gap between talented and expert Instructors from around the world and other professionals and students, eager to learn new skills in the IT sector, colleges and schools, enabling them to expand their knowledge and enhance career opportunities to the fullest.</p>
<p>Each Instructor and their content on our site goes through a rigorous but efficient screening process to ensure, only the best in the industry are made available to our students. On Kloudmagica, learners have the flexibility to learn at their own time and pace or what we define as ‘Self-paced Learning’. Students can book live classes or access recorded sessions to accommodate their busy schedule. Our courses are specially curated by experts who constantly gauge and keep track with latest developments in the IT industry, resulting in the most relevant and practical e-learning experience.</p>
<h3>Kloudmagica Leader</h3>
<p>The project is taking a lead under the leadership of Mrs. Archana Raj,  the Director and founder of the platform named Kloudmagica Infotech Private Limited. Archana also has working experience with RBS and ADITI technologies. She is highly energetic, enthusiastic and self-motivated entrepreneur. She holds her Master of Business Administration degree in Finance. Born and brought up from a small village in India, she has faced a lot of challenges in completing her education as there was no legitimate asset at her village. She has even been teaching students, to afford the cost required of her education. Since then, she had a dream to contribute her learning and expertise in the field of education field and helping the students in need.</p>
<h3>We all deserve a chance to be better programmers!</h3>
<p>An increasing number of professionals and immediate college graduates are finding difficulties in getting a job. This is primarily due to the gap between available and the required skills in the industry. On the other hand, we even have a pool of veteran professionals who can impart these skills, but are limited in terms of reach. And the idea quickly spread through the state and is now backed by dozens of Lecturers, as well as local, national, and international Professionals! There are millions of professionals who are looking for a brand-new opportunity because either they are no longer happy with their present job profile or are looking to expand their skill set either for their own growth or as part of a new requirement. Most of these young minds want to become the champion in their respective teams, but are unaware on how to upgrade their skills at all, as most of the experienced instructors are not reachable. The main reason for such a gap between the students and the instructors is the approach-ability and accessibility. Instructors cannot reach everywhere because of some individual limitation like job agreement or family and even the logistics limitations. For students, the limitation can be economical or unapproachable.</p>
<h3>What's the problem audience is currently facing?</h3>
<p>Most of the students does not know how to upgrade their skills at all because lacking good instructors for them. The main reason for this is, the gap between the students and the smart instructors because of the diverse region, country or cities. Instructors cannot fly out because of individual limitation like job agreement or family. The student cannot venture out because of financial constraints.</p>
<p>Apart from this Most of the hot skill courses available in the market are few plus expensive and mostly are out of reach of maximum students. The courses for which is the cost is low, the quality is likewise low which will result in insufficient and no-value learning. </p>
<h3>Kloudmagica's Solutions For you!</h3>
<p>Kloudmagica is right here to fill the gap by providing a huge platform where everyone can learn significantly more by utilizing our courses. We have been working hard and we have few talented instructors who are also buckling down, but we need to break through many more trainers because of the rapid change in technology. We have the stage set of different goals, but the first one is to educate the people. Kloudmagica is working like a bridge between the students and instructors. At Kloudmagica the students can get easy registration and they can purchase the courses without any difficulty to upgrade their skills.</p>
<p>Our goal is to bridge this gap by creating an affordable platform that provides high quality, self-paced + live classes + classroom training courses. This will communicate the missing skills/knowledge, not only to the students but skilled professionals as well. At the same time, this will provide employment and a healthy living to the participating teachers by means of earnings using economies of scale.</p>

</div></div>","Who are we?
KloudMagica is a unique, live and interactive e-learning platform that is redefining professional e-learning. Our purpose is to bridge the gap between talented and expert Instructors from around the world and other professionals and students, eager to learn new skills in the IT sector, colleges and schools, enabling them to expand their knowledge and enhance career opportunities to the fullest.
Each Instructor and their content on our site goes through a rigorous but efficient screening process to ensure, only the best in the industry are made available to our students. On Kloudmagica, learners have the flexibility to learn at their own time and pace or what we define as ‘Self-paced Learning’. Students can book live classes or access recorded sessions to accommodate their busy schedule. Our courses are specially curated by experts who constantly gauge and keep track with latest developments in the IT industry, resulting in the most relevant and practical e-learning experience.
Kloudmagica Leader
The project is taking a lead under the leadership of Mrs. Archana Raj,  the Director and founder of the platform named Kloudmagica Infotech Private Limited. Archana also has working experience with RBS and ADITI technologies. She is highly energetic, enthusiastic and self-motivated entrepreneur. She holds her Master of Business Administration degree in Finance. Born and brought up from a small village in India, she has faced a lot of challenges in completing her education as there was no legitimate asset at her village. She has even been teaching students, to afford the cost required of her education. Since then, she had a dream to contribute her learning and expertise in the field of education field and helping the students in need.
We all deserve a chance to be better programmers!
An increasing number of professionals and immediate college graduates are finding difficulties in getting a job. This is primarily due to the gap between available and the required skills in the industry. On the other hand, we even have a pool of veteran professionals who can impart these skills, but are limited in terms of reach. And the idea quickly spread through the state and is now backed by dozens of Lecturers, as well as local, national, and international Professionals! There are millions of professionals who are looking for a brand-new opportunity because either they are no longer happy with their present job profile or are looking to expand their skill set either for their own growth or as part of a new requirement. Most of these young minds want to become the champion in their respective teams, but are unaware on how to upgrade their skills at all, as most of the experienced instructors are not reachable. The main reason for such a gap between the students and the instructors is the approach-ability and accessibility. Instructors cannot reach everywhere because of some individual limitation like job agreement or family and even the logistics limitations. For students, the limitation can be economical or unapproachable.
What's the problem audience is currently facing?
Most of the students does not know how to upgrade their skills at all because lacking good instructors for them. The main reason for this is, the gap between the students and the smart instructors because of the diverse region, country or cities. Instructors cannot fly out because of individual limitation like job agreement or family. The student cannot venture out because of financial constraints.
Apart from this Most of the hot skill courses available in the market are few plus expensive and mostly are out of reach of maximum students. The courses for which is the cost is low, the quality is likewise low which will result in insufficient and no-value learning.

Ze leren dat je meer verdient wanneer je eerst iets gaat studeren, dat je voor elkaar en de omgeving iets kunt betekenen, en dat je aan het eind iets kleins kunt kopen met het verdiende 'geld', maar iets groots wanneer je het bij elkaar legt, bijvoorbeeld met een hele klas, of door te sparen op een eigen 'bankrekening'. </span><br/></p>

Voor zijn kinderen werden geboren, was hij instructeur bij de Koninklijke Luchtmacht. Vanwege alle zorg die zijn gezin nodig had, begon hij met iets heel anders en ging o.a. van die mooie beloningsplaatjes verkopen voor scholen. </span><br/>

<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Ook richtte hij 2 stichtingen op: SOVA en Autstede, om gezinnen met autistische kinderen de tijd van hun leven te geven. Hij bedacht een levende, maar stille knuffel-kabouter, zodat de kinderen konden communiceren wat ze wilden, zonder enig commentaar. En hij huurde twee gebouwen voor speciale vakantie weekends. Gezinnen konden met hun autistische kind en de brusjes - (broers en zusjes) komen. Vader en moeder zouden verblijven apart van de kinderen, met de mogelijkheid om met de andere ouders te praten, en samen een leuk weekend te hebben. De kinderen kregen een speciale kleur T-shirt en een persoonlijke gids met dezelfde kleur en konden allerlei activiteiten doen, met een grote show op het einde van het weekend. Wonderen konden gebeuren op het moment dat ALLE kinderen hun bijzondere talenten toonden, omdat ze  vrij en zonder angsten waren. </span><br/>

Zo kunnen we de bank, de overheid en grote investeerders overtuigen dat heel veel mensen achter ons initiatief staan, en ze mee krijgen om deze droom ook voor kinderen in Nederland uit te laten komen. Daarna kunnen we volle kracht vooruit. Klik op 'Contribute now' en doneer een willekeurig bedrag (anoniem kan ook) of kies een 'Perk' zodat je een van de eerste bezoekers wordt van het themapark. Voor we officieel open zijn mogen volwassenen ook meedoen met de beroepen, de activiteiten waar ze in passen en ervaren wat het is om elk beroep te kunnen uitvoeren, waar je je hele leven al van hebt gedroomd. Het is wel nodig gegevens in te vullen, zodat we de entreebewijzen en uitnodigingen voor een VIP-dag naar het juiste adres kunnen sturen. Niet iedereen heeft of wil een PayPal rekening. Vink dan bij het betalen de optie voor een PayPal rekening uit. Daarna krijg je de optie om met een creditcard te betalen. Heb je ook geen creditcard maar wil je wel doneren, stuur dan een berichtje via 'contact'. We sturen je dan het rekeningnummer en een bevestiging zodra het geld gestort is. Deze bevestiging kan je gebruiken als toegangskaartje, wanneer je graag gebruik wilt maken van de speciale aanbiedingen. Het geld wordt verzameld op onze PayPal rekening, en uitbetaald aan het Themapark zodra we de doelstelling halen. Wanneer je iets wilt vragen, of je kunt niet alle informatie invullen die nodig is <br/>( b.v. een telefoonnummer ), klik dan op 'contact' .

Prof. dr. Jelle Jolles van de VU in Amsterdam geeft aan dat het gedrag en beleving van een kind en tiener worden bepaald door zowel biologische als psychologische, sociale en culturele factoren. Daarom zal alles op alles worden gezet om de Nederlandse cultuur en de sociale waarden van de mini-gemeenschap die de kinderstad is, zo compleet en verantwoord mogelijk aan te bieden. De aandacht die aan voeding voor de geest en het lichaam wordt besteed is erop gericht om kinderen te laten ervaren hoe leuk en lekker het kan zijn om een gezonde en uitdagende maaltijd klaar te maken, en ook de rijpe vruchten te laten plukken van de toegankelijk en spannend gemaakte Universiteits-lessen, ook voor de jonge bezoekers. De richtlijnen van fora voor hoogbegaafdheid worden hierin  meegenomen, maar ook voor leermoeilijkheden. <br/></span></span></span></p></li>

</div></div>","Samenvatting 


In dit unieke themapark kunnen alle kinderen tussen 4 en 14 jaar zichzelf volwassen voelen in een stad die op maat is gemaakt.  Ze laten de economie draaien, handhaven de orde, werken, spelen en leren onder deskundige begeleiding. Ze staan springend van enthousiasme buiten in de korte rij, 'vliegen' naar hun eigen wereld, rennen naar de bank om hun eigen 'geld' op te halen, en als het op is, gaan ze met een vrolijk gezicht 'werken' in alle beroepen waar ze ooit van hebben gedroomd en meer. Ze leren dat je meer verdient wanneer je eerst iets gaat studeren, dat je voor elkaar en de omgeving iets kunt betekenen, en dat je aan het eind iets kleins kunt kopen met het verdiende 'geld', maar iets groots wanneer je het bij elkaar legt, bijvoorbeeld met een hele klas, of door te sparen op een eigen 'bankrekening'. 

Introductie





Het begon allemaal met een vader van 3 zoons, waarvan één met autisme. Voor zijn kinderen werden geboren, was hij instructeur bij de Koninklijke Luchtmacht. Vanwege alle zorg die zijn gezin nodig had, begon hij met iets heel anders en ging o.a. van die mooie beloningsplaatjes verkopen voor scholen. 


Ook richtte hij 2 stichtingen op: SOVA en Autstede, om gezinnen met autistische kinderen de tijd van hun leven te geven. Hij bedacht een levende, maar stille knuffel-kabouter, zodat de kinderen konden communiceren wat ze wilden, zonder enig commentaar. En hij huurde twee gebouwen voor speciale vakantie weekends. Gezinnen konden met hun autistische kind en de brusjes - (broers en zusjes) komen. Vader en moeder zouden verblijven apart van de kinderen, met de mogelijkheid om met de andere ouders te praten, en samen een leuk weekend te hebben. De kinderen kregen een speciale kleur T-shirt en een persoonlijke gids met dezelfde kleur en konden allerlei activiteiten doen, met een grote show op het einde van het weekend. Wonderen konden gebeuren op het moment dat ALLE kinderen hun bijzondere talenten toonden, omdat ze  vrij en zonder angsten waren. 


Mede door het enthousiasme van zijn nieuwe vrouw (een lerares met interesse voor stoere ICT- dingen) en zijn oudste zoon is zijn motivatie alleen maar sterker geworden. Het idee om kinderen te laten ontdekken waar ze allemaal goed in zijn, terwijl ouders/verzorgers lekker tot rust kunnen komen, werd steeds groter. 

Samen met een vriendelijke financiële tovenaar om de magie te laten gebeuren (onmisbaar bij zo'n groot project) en een vrolijke gastheer van ons favoriete restaurant, is er een team gegroeid om dit stevig op te pakken en een enorme stap verder te zetten. We reisden naar verre landen om een stad te vinden voor kinderen waar ze nu al kunnen zijn wat ze ooit willen worden.




We ontmoetten een franchise-organisatie die al heeft gerealiseerd waar wij nog over dromen. Na 18 maanden werk aan een solide businessplan kunnen we niet wachten om te beginnen met de bouw van een permanente plek voor alle kinderen, waar ook de ouders een fijne tijd voor zichzelf kunnen hebben, dicht bij hun kinderen die vrij zijn om hun gang te gaan en te spelen dat ze volwassen zijn in hun eigen economie.





Wat we nodig hebben & wat je krijgt
 

Het is echt nodig dat jullie meedoen. Zo kunnen we de bank, de overheid en grote investeerders overtuigen dat heel veel mensen achter ons initiatief staan, en ze mee krijgen om deze droom ook voor kinderen in Nederland uit te laten komen. Daarna kunnen we volle kracht vooruit. Klik op 'Contribute now' en doneer een willekeurig bedrag (anoniem kan ook) of kies een 'Perk' zodat je een van de eerste bezoekers wordt van het themapark. Voor we officieel open zijn mogen volwassenen ook meedoen met de beroepen, de activiteiten waar ze in passen en ervaren wat het is om elk beroep te kunnen uitvoeren, waar je je hele leven al van hebt gedroomd. Het is wel nodig gegevens in te vullen, zodat we de entreebewijzen en uitnodigingen voor een VIP-dag naar het juiste adres kunnen sturen. Niet iedereen heeft of wil een PayPal rekening. Vink dan bij het betalen de optie voor een PayPal rekening uit. Daarna krijg je de optie om met een creditcard te betalen. Heb je ook geen creditcard maar wil je wel doneren, stuur dan een berichtje via 'contact'. We sturen je dan het rekeningnummer en een bevestiging zodra het geld gestort is. Deze bevestiging kan je gebruiken als toegangskaartje, wanneer je graag gebruik wilt maken van de speciale aanbiedingen. Het geld wordt verzameld op onze PayPal rekening, en uitbetaald aan het Themapark zodra we de doelstelling halen. Wanneer je iets wilt vragen, of je kunt niet alle informatie invullen die nodig is ( b.v. een telefoonnummer ), klik dan op 'contact' . We kijken elke dag naar de berichten, dus krijg je snel antwoord of bevestiging dat je gegevens goed zijn aangekomen. 




Als we het volledige bedrag niet via IndieGoGo bij elkaar kunnen krijgen, dan moeten we de plannen uitstellen totdat we een andere manier hebben gevonden om onze stoere stad te realiseren. Iedereen die heeft meegedaan krijgt in dat geval netjes zijn geld terug. Om deze kinderstad echt mogelijk te maken, hopen we dat jullie net zo enthousiast worden als wij en meedoen aan het realiseren van een fantastisch leuk en leerzaam themapark, zodat het over ongeveer 18 -21 maanden werkelijk in gebruik genomen kan worden.

We hebben een speciale actie voor scholen, teams en jeugdclubs: zij kunnen een gratis bezoek winnen rondom de eerste openingsdagen om zelf te komen kijken en ervaren dat de kinderen zich enorm zullen vermaken en de leerkrachten of begeleiders 5 uur lang een ontspannen schoolreisje kunnen hebben. De kinderen ervaren een grote zelfstandigheid, omdat ze hun eigen weg kunnen kiezen. Er is genoeg gelegenheid om te kijken en foto's te maken van de kinderen van de eigen groep. Het goed opgeleide personeel van het themapark staat overal klaar om elke activiteit tot een succes te maken.  


Bent u bereid om 1000 euro of meer te betalen, dan krijgt u een VIP-dag aangeboden voor het hele gezin. Geniet de hele middag van een geweldige ervaring in het themapark, geheel verzorgd en uiteraard met extra hapjes en verse drankjes in de lounge, een voorstelling in het theater en een officiële 'statie'-foto samen met de stoere animatie-karakters op het centrale plein, die u als aandenken mee naar huis kunt nemen.


  Wat betekent de komst van dit unieke themapark?



Op 12 februari 2015 is de regering van Nederland begonnen met Platform # Onderwijs 2032. Het platform houdt zich bezig met de inhoud van het onderwijs in Nederland. De nadruk zal liggen op drie onderwerpen: Kennis over leren en arbeid, maatschappelijke vorming en persoonlijke ontwikkeling.Met al het onderzoek dat we het afgelopen anderhalf jaar hebben gedaan en de resultaten die we hebben gezien in de educatieve parken van de franchise organisatie in de grote steden over de hele wereld, denken we dat we in de geest van dit Platform ons onderwijs kunnen verrijken met de ervaringen die de kinderen opdoen in zo'n rijke, vrije en veilige omgeving om te experimenteren, te ontwerpen en gewoon te dóen. Prof. dr. Jelle Jolles van de VU in Amsterdam geeft aan dat het gedrag en beleving van een kind en tiener worden bepaald door zowel biologische als psychologische, sociale en culturele factoren. Daarom zal alles op alles worden gezet om de Nederlandse cultuur en de sociale waarden van de mini-gemeenschap die de kinderstad is, zo compleet en verantwoord mogelijk aan te bieden. De aandacht die aan voeding voor de geest en het lichaam wordt besteed is erop gericht om kinderen te laten ervaren hoe leuk en lekker het kan zijn om een gezonde en uitdagende maaltijd klaar te maken, en ook de rijpe vruchten te laten plukken van de toegankelijk en spannend gemaakte Universiteits-lessen, ook voor de jonge bezoekers. De richtlijnen van fora voor hoogbegaafdheid worden hierin  meegenomen, maar ook voor leermoeilijkheden. 
Omdat we een land zijn waar ruimtevaart, gezondheid en duurzaamheid hoog in het vaandel staat, verwachten we zeker ook op dat gebied een aantal kinderen te inspireren, zodat zij de beroepen uit kunnen vinden waar we nu nog geen naam voor hebben bedacht. 
We hebben een diep geloof in onze Nederlandse trots en hopen dat we met crowdfunding en vele aanhangers van een geweldig idee een begin kunnen maken, en dat we genoeg steun van ouders, de overheid, onderwijsinstellingen en idealisten met focus op de toekomst kunnen vinden, om het themapark daadwerkelijk te kunnen realiseren.

Uitdagingen




We hebben gezien dat meer dan 450.000 kinderen per jaar een geweldige tijd zouden kunnen hebben, meer dan 150 mensen kunnen een nieuwe baan krijgen, en beroepen die nog niet eens een naam hebben, zouden wel eens een welwillend en buitengewoon begaafd publiek kunnen vinden in onze stad van stoere kinderen.

 
Om alle geldstromen goed te kunnen reguleren hebben we FEBA Holding BV opgericht met de voorzitter en vice-voorzitter. Verder hebben we de functies van CFO, F&B en PR vervuld, allemaal nodig voor het uitvoeren van het steeds groter wordende takenpakket. Met onze CFO, die ervaring heeft met grote geld-zaken voor een landelijke onderneming, merken we dat we een sterke waakhond in huis hebben.
Met een flexibele instelling, een docent voor het voortgezet onderwijs en 37 jaar ervaring op allerlei niveau's, is de inhoud bewaakt en blijft de organisatie leren van de kinderen. Tal van vaardigheden en verdere studie op gebied van recreatie en management, maken de overgang mogelijk naar een grotere schaal.De franchise onderneming heeft over de hele wereld bewezen, dat ze weten wat ze aan het doen zijn. Ze hebben vertrouwen in ons team, maar maken zich zorgen over het geld. Dat doen wij ook, maar zodra we de eerste stappen kunnen betalen, krijgen we van hen alle steun om namens hen te spreken als officiële franchisenemer.      Andere manieren waarop je kunt helpen

</h4><div>There's an overwhelming shortage of software development skills - web, mobile, gaming, enterprise, UX, UI, cyber security and more in the software industry. That translates to several thousands yet-to-be-filled tech job positions across the world and growing. You know why? Innovation happens in the software industry at a rate the school curriculum as we have it now..... simply can't catch up with! There is need for training programs specifically designed to remedy that skills gap.<br/><br/>
<h4>Why Africa?</h4>
<p><b><i>Talent is evenly distributed the world over, opportunity is not!</i></b><br/></p>
<p>Most people in developing countries of the world are nearly completely excluded from the digital revolution due to inadequate learning resources, internet facilities and power supply, a phenomenon often referred to as the digital divide. Whereas <b>right here in Africa lies the potential to supply in a cost-effective way most of the human resources needed</b> to fill those tech job openings because there is an ever growing population of talented, motivated  and excited young men and women in developing countries, especially Africa.</p>
<h4>Action Plan <br/>
</h4>Codetime Africa is an ambitious program that aims to bridge this divide by:-
<p>      <b>1</b>. Starting a <b>self-sustaining training center</b><b>, Guardian Code School </b>in select towns and cities across Africa, equipped with all resources necessary to teach software development - computers, robust internet access, power, etc.<br/></p>
<p>      <b>2</b>. Strategically locate each <b>Guardian Code School</b> near a University or College especially one that offers Computer Science Programs.</p>
<p>      <b>3</b>. Provide regular 3-month, 6-month and year-long highly engaging training and certification programs.<br/></p>
<p>      <b>4</b>. Connect our job-ready learners to industry partners for internships and employment as they qualify.<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

</div></div>","Why Start A Program To Teach Software Development?
There's an overwhelming shortage of software development skills - web, mobile, gaming, enterprise, UX, UI, cyber security and more in the software industry. That translates to several thousands yet-to-be-filled tech job positions across the world and growing. You know why? Innovation happens in the software industry at a rate the school curriculum as we have it now..... simply can't catch up with! There is need for training programs specifically designed to remedy that skills gap.
Why Africa?
Talent is evenly distributed the world over, opportunity is not!
Most people in developing countries of the world are nearly completely excluded from the digital revolution due to inadequate learning resources, internet facilities and power supply, a phenomenon often referred to as the digital divide. Whereas right here in Africa lies the potential to supply in a cost-effective way most of the human resources needed to fill those tech job openings because there is an ever growing population of talented, motivated  and excited young men and women in developing countries, especially Africa.
Action Plan 
Codetime Africa is an ambitious program that aims to bridge this divide by:-
      1. Starting a self-sustaining training center, Guardian Code School in select towns and cities across Africa, equipped with all resources necessary to teach software development - computers, robust internet access, power, etc.
      2. Strategically locate each Guardian Code School near a University or College especially one that offers Computer Science Programs.
      3. Provide regular 3-month, 6-month and year-long highly engaging training and certification programs.
      4. Connect our job-ready learners to industry partners for internships and employment as they qualify.   What We Need & What You Get
 We need $25,000 for the pilot project. The funds will enable us to:-

      1. Get classroom space to accommodate 24 learners at a time, 12 in each classroom.
      2. Install hybrid backup power that includes solar.
      3. Buy 26 computers, 2 Projectors and a printer/scanner.
      4. Furniture and other classroom equipment.
      5. Mobilize our volunteer instructors and Guardian fellows.
Growth Plan

The pilot project is to start the premier Guardian Code School in Lagos Nigeria to be followed by Kumasi, Ghana, Johannesburg, South Africa, Yaounde, Cameroon and more
The Impact


Imagine the next generation of innovators that will develop the next wave of solutions and products using technology walk right out of Africa.
Imagine African youths and kids become producers of the computer games 
they play.
Youths we work with are already showing extraordinary aptitude with code on mini projects and that's inspiring.

It is our dream that in a near future, great software solutions, for instance, systems that will make the skies a safer place to fly and city transports systems that are highly efficient would come right out of Africa.How Do I Support This Project?
