<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We have all been there. You have an awesome presentation, you're dressed to kill and then the technology fails. The WiFi is down, you have the wrong plug or it is plain taking forever. Now, you're stressed and the clients that you are supposed to impress are now staring at their watches, or worse-- they glaring at you. Not a good way to make a first impression. Even if you get it to work - you’ve lost your edge.</span></p>

<p>Imagine... <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">you show up at your meeting, plug the wireless WeKast into any HDMI or VGA port, open your fantastic presentation on your device and you're ready to go. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">You control everything -- slides, business docs, videos or photos -- from the app.</span></p>

<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">No setup. Just plug &amp; cast! </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">No need to rely on any other device or equipment</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">No need to rely on local WIFI </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">No need to carry around anything other than your phone and your WeKast</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Freedom to move around the room, while controlling everything from your phone</span></li>
</ul>
<h1>WHAT'S UNIQUE? </h1>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">WeKast is the only mobile-based professional presentation solution that completely eliminates the awkward set-up process while increasing mobility and engagement. WeKast was designed for a professional environment with mobility and simplicity in mind.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Other wireless mobile solutions, like Chromecast or Apple TV, are great for watching movies or listening to music at home but we feel they are not suitable for business use due in part to lengthy setups. They need a 10-20 minutes setup for every change in meeting location, you have to repeat the process and connect to the local WIFI. Home solutions are impractical and unreliable for business meetings.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">WeKast does not need any set up. It lets you connect without requiring a setup, an internet connection or even a laptop. If you still prefer to use your laptop, you can also do so without needing cables or adapters that ties you to one spot.</span></p>
<h1>HOW IT WORKS</h1>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our 2 steps solution could not be any easier:  </span><br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">1) </span><b>Plug Wekast </b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">to any TV or projector using the HDMI or VGA port - WeKast acts as a WiFi router that communicates automatically to your phone or tablet. </span><br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">2) </span><b>Open the app </b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">and select a preloaded presentation. You can upload directly any files from your Dropbox or Google Drive. One click and you are presenting. </span><br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The app supports files into a mobile format keeping fonts, colors and videos intact. It’s also easy to preload presentations on your device from your PC. Just use our built-in PowerPoint plug-in to send files. Once you open the app, your presentations will be downloaded and ready to go. </span></p>

<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
<p>WeKast was born out of necessity, for our own use. We then realized that so many of our friends felt the same way. <br/><br/>After carrying our laptops around, untangling wires, and having to rely on spotty wifi networks one too many times, we knew we needed to create a device that provided setup-free mobile presentations. It was time to put an end to the painful presentation process that wastes time and that has not been disrupted in years. <br/><br/>Our company is passionate with creating an unmatched solution that’s easy-to-use. Our mission is to provide a reliable presenting solution to help people optimize their presentations in every way. <br/><br/>So far all of our feedback has been over the top, everyone from professionals “on-the-go” to entrepreneurs are enjoying the many useful benefits of WeKast. Together with our team, we take our passion for innovation beyond our products and in every decision we make. </p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We have developed our plan for manufacturing in Asia and for shipping to our backers around the world. We have sourced the factories for all of WeKast's major components. During the production process, we expect to make minor changes to optimize the design for mass production. On the logistics side, we have established partnerships with a US fulfillment house and international shippers to help the WeKasts get to where they’re going quickly and safely.</p>
<p>We have taken the time to get nearly everything in place before launching this campaign. We took the risk up front by delaying the launch of this campaign until we believed it was ready, to lessen the risk to our backers. We have a great team in place so we don't predict many obstacles here. But there is always the unknown. But we will face every obstacle with the same tenacity and perseverance that we have from the start.</p>
<p>We pledge to keep our backers well-informed in a timely manner throughout the entire production process and to do everything we can to deliver the WeKast to you as planned.</p>

You can present your content straight from your smartphone, tablet or laptop. WeKast delivers it where you want-- to ANY screen. Simple and streamlined. Just plug and cast!Presentation Nightmares 



We have all been there. You have an awesome presentation, you're dressed to kill and then the technology fails. The WiFi is down, you have the wrong plug or it is plain taking forever. Now, you're stressed and the clients that you are supposed to impress are now staring at their watches, or worse-- they glaring at you. Not a good way to make a first impression. Even if you get it to work - you’ve lost your edge.

The WeKast Solution


Imagine... you show up at your meeting, plug the wireless WeKast into any HDMI or VGA port, open your fantastic presentation on your device and you're ready to go. 
You control everything -- slides, business docs, videos or photos -- from the app.


With no wires, tech problems or hassle. You can smile, relax and engage with your audience. You got this.  


WeKast has your back!  

No setup. Just plug & cast! 
No need to rely on any other device or equipment
No need to rely on local WIFI 
No need to carry around anything other than your phone and your WeKast
Freedom to move around the room, while controlling everything from your phone

WHAT'S UNIQUE? 
WeKast is the only mobile-based professional presentation solution that completely eliminates the awkward set-up process while increasing mobility and engagement. WeKast was designed for a professional environment with mobility and simplicity in mind.  
Other wireless mobile solutions, like Chromecast or Apple TV, are great for watching movies or listening to music at home but we feel they are not suitable for business use due in part to lengthy setups. They need a 10-20 minutes setup for every change in meeting location, you have to repeat the process and connect to the local WIFI. Home solutions are impractical and unreliable for business meetings.
WeKast does not need any set up. It lets you connect without requiring a setup, an internet connection or even a laptop. If you still prefer to use your laptop, you can also do so without needing cables or adapters that ties you to one spot.
HOW IT WORKS
Our 2 steps solution could not be any easier:  1) Plug Wekast to any TV or projector using the HDMI or VGA port - WeKast acts as a WiFi router that communicates automatically to your phone or tablet. 2) Open the app and select a preloaded presentation. You can upload directly any files from your Dropbox or Google Drive. One click and you are presenting. The app supports files into a mobile format keeping fonts, colors and videos intact. It’s also easy to preload presentations on your device from your PC. Just use our built-in PowerPoint plug-in to send files. Once you open the app, your presentations will be downloaded and ready to go. 




WEKAST ENGAGEMENT PLATFORM


The best presentations are conversations where you can interact with your audience. This is why we came up with WeKast ENGAGE. WeKast engagement platform will allow you to: 1) Share your slides live with attendees 2) Collect feedback in real time 3) Follow up with attendees/ send your presentation 4) Engage with your broader audience via Social Media channels Our goal is to make meetings more social, interactive and dynamic. And at the same time, making it easy to connect any screens together and share experiences anywhere.
To Sum it Up





 The exact specifications are subject to minor changes as we optimize the design for mass production.

ABOUT US
WeKast was born out of necessity, for our own use. We then realized that so many of our friends felt the same way. After carrying our laptops around, untangling wires, and having to rely on spotty wifi networks one too many times, we knew we needed to create a device that provided setup-free mobile presentations. It was time to put an end to the painful presentation process that wastes time and that has not been disrupted in years. Our company is passionate with creating an unmatched solution that’s easy-to-use. Our mission is to provide a reliable presenting solution to help people optimize their presentations in every way. So far all of our feedback has been over the top, everyone from professionals “on-the-go” to entrepreneurs are enjoying the many useful benefits of WeKast. Together with our team, we take our passion for innovation beyond our products and in every decision we make. 














HOW CAN YOU HELP?
We've now finalized our WeKast prototype, but moving to the production phase requires significant capital and scale. We need your help to finance the required tooling and meet minimum order quantities. We've spent months working out all of the details at all levels of this project, and are very excited about finally having the opportunity to bring the simplicity and reliability of WeKast to each one of you. With your help we can make the perfect presentation solution available to everyone. If you are someone who shares great ideas and needs a professional tool that you can rely on, back WeKast. Because there's no second chance for a first impression.

<h3>Compatible materials</h3>
<p>Cakewalk3d works with many different recipes, as long as they meet the required viscosity. We have successfully 3d printed with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chocolate</li>
<li>Meringue</li>
<li>Vegetable puree</li>
<li>Ketchup</li>
<li>Guacamole</li>
<li>Honey</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't know what to start with, no worries. A tested food mix will be included with every reward, you' ll just need to add water and you can start to print right away! 3 food mix recipes are already available: salted veggie mix, french meringue or vegan meringue.</p>
<p>A recipes guide with the detailed steps and the setting profile for your favorite slicers will be also included and constantly updated on our website.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Safety in the kitchen</h3>
<p>We designed Cakewalk3d with food safety as a priority, and selected the best material for the mechanical parts. Only food-grade stainless steel, silicone and PP will be in contact with your food. All parts can go to the dishwasher and will be certified.</p>
<p>We also include a silicone baking mat in order to protect the bed of your 3d printer and get a food printing space as safe as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Easy to use</h3>
<p>Using Cakewalk 3d doesn’t mean you will never 3D print plastic anymore. It takes less than 30 minutes to remove your extruder and install the new device. Cakewalk is working as an extruder so there’s no need to change anything on the connections on your card or even your firmware. Slicing profiles are provided for selected materials.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Open design</h3>
<p>We chose to make our products extendable, upgradable, and easy to maintain.</p>
<p>Except the food-safe core parts of the extruder, most parts are standard spare parts that can be sourced. This campaign is designed to help us fund the injection molds for the core parts.</p>
<p>3D Printing lovers are part of a strong community and we hope that more and more makers will experiment and promote food printing thanks to Cakewalk 3d. We’re eager to get feedback and don’t worry we’ll be always here to help!</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Marine. I’m a 3D printing executive, a graduated pastry chef, and the creator of Cakewalk 3d. I live in Paris, France.</p>
<p>I love innovating with food and that's why I started Cakewalk 3d, first as a side project during the spring. It all began when we were all quarantined in France, and I wanted to automate my own pastry techniques. With a mechanical engineer, we worked together remotely, each one testing and improving on its own 3D printer.  We gather our result daily, and we iterated over 3 months.</p>
<p>Once I started showing other pastry lovers the desserts I was getting, there was so much interest that I knew it was something I had to share with the whole 3D printing community. I worked and designed new recipes during months (mostly tested and approved by my coworkers!) and searched for the best production methods.</p>
<p>Even if I always want to 3D print everything, I came to the conclusion that the core parts of the extruder need to be injected. So I worked with an engineering team to select the best providers and design the molds. The campaign is aimed to raise enough money to pay these molds.</p>
<p>Thanks to your support, Cakewalk 3d will be soon in production, and I am really excited to share what we’ve built with the Kickstarter community.</p>
<p>If you’d like to see some of the designs and recipes I’ve been getting with Cakewalk 3D, you can find me on Instagram @marine_corebaillais</p>

Cakewalk 3D is a precise, effective and handy upgrade that converts your desktop 3D printer into a food printer. It enables you to unleash your creativity in the kitchen, producing detailed shapes in a few minutes which would take the best chef a couple hours to design.
 

Finish up your meal like never before

Do you want to save time and impress your hosts with fine dining? If so, the Cakewalk 3d is the perfect printing device for you.
More than just another paste extruder, Cakewalk 3D is an all-included box designed by a French pastry chef. Find everything you need to print out your vision: ingredients, silicone baking mat, food-safe extruder and detailed instructions to train yourself on your first 3D prints. You will quickly achieve amazing results.
 

Never fail a birthday cake

We've all failed a cake design at least once in our life. Now you can create your own cake lace patterns, or custom decorations that you can add on the top of the next birthday cake. Thanks to the nozzle of 1 mm you can 3D print delicate cake designs or unique treats that no one will ever find in a store.
 
3D Print stunning appetizers

What about designing fun shapes on your computer and 3D print them on crackers for an astonishing cocktail ? We provide you recipes and ingredients to succeed in your first prints, and let you be the inventor of new snacks.

 
Create incredible plates like a star-rated chef

If you don't feel like a member of the piping bag world champion league, or will never graduate from any fancy chef schools, Cakewalk 3d is your ally to accomplish star-rated chef recipes.  Like your own personal kitchen assistant, Cakewalk 3d lets you focus on cooking while it takes care of the rest.
 
Convert your leftovers into savory prints

Let’s face it, there’s no much fun in eating the leftovers. Now you can mash them and use Cakewalk 3d to turn them into savory snacks. A brocoli-based crocodile or a parsnip-carrot unicorn looks more appetizing for everyone. 

 



Cakewalk3d is really easy to set up into your own 3D printer and works like your regular plastic extruder.


Cakewalk3d works with Creality, Anet, Anycubic, Alfawise, Prusa… and many FDM printers

Cakewalk 3d fully supports dozens of 3D cartesian printers.  We have successfully tested on major brands such as Creality, Anycubic, Alfawise, Prusa or Anet...  We provide instructions and the 3D files  for free download, that will fit for a wide range of 3D printers.
 
A new chapter in your 3d printing journey
 

To adapt Cakewalk 3d to your printer, all you need is to 3D print 3 supporting parts:

1 connector between the cartridge and the Nema motor
2 detachable rings to hold the cartridge

The prints take less than 10 hours to complete on most desktop 3D printers and the CAD files are available for download. We can handle it for you if needed, using professional 3d printing technology for better accuracy.

Over the past weeks, we gathered feedbacks from makers to food-lovers accross various fablabs, incubators and cooking schools.

""Innovation and a lot of fun for our first workshop"" @Fablab ESILV
 

""A new step in our cooking journey and a milestone for the curry sauce!"" @Fablab CentraleSupelec
 

""Cakewalk 3d is the first step into the stimulating and inspiring world of 3D food printing!"" @SmartFoodParis
Tricky to see people smiling behind masks, still eyes were lit with wonder! 

We believe everyone is creative. So we've designed Cakewalk3d to be simple enough for anyone to use. 

Whether you're a professional creator or a weekend tinkerer, the Cakewalk3d is a powerful tool for bringing your food ideas to life.
 

 
You can use your favorite 3D slicer in order to prepare your masterpieces, just like you would normally do for any kind of prints.  To help everyone with the first steps, we include an ingredient mix in every box (you can choose between French meringue, vegan meringue, or salted veggie mix). And the 3D files of our best recipes are available on the major 3D marketplaces. Feel confused? Our support group on Facebook got you covered. You're welcome to join here!

Compatible materials
Cakewalk3d works with many different recipes, as long as they meet the required viscosity. We have successfully 3d printed with:

Chocolate
Meringue
Vegetable puree
Ketchup
Guacamole
Honey

If you don't know what to start with, no worries. A tested food mix will be included with every reward, you' ll just need to add water and you can start to print right away! 3 food mix recipes are already available: salted veggie mix, french meringue or vegan meringue.
A recipes guide with the detailed steps and the setting profile for your favorite slicers will be also included and constantly updated on our website.
 
Safety in the kitchen
We designed Cakewalk3d with food safety as a priority, and selected the best material for the mechanical parts. Only food-grade stainless steel, silicone and PP will be in contact with your food. All parts can go to the dishwasher and will be certified.
We also include a silicone baking mat in order to protect the bed of your 3d printer and get a food printing space as safe as possible.
 
Easy to use
Using Cakewalk 3d doesn’t mean you will never 3D print plastic anymore. It takes less than 30 minutes to remove your extruder and install the new device. Cakewalk is working as an extruder so there’s no need to change anything on the connections on your card or even your firmware. Slicing profiles are provided for selected materials.

 
Open design
We chose to make our products extendable, upgradable, and easy to maintain.
Except the food-safe core parts of the extruder, most parts are standard spare parts that can be sourced. This campaign is designed to help us fund the injection molds for the core parts.
3D Printing lovers are part of a strong community and we hope that more and more makers will experiment and promote food printing thanks to Cakewalk 3d. We’re eager to get feedback and don’t worry we’ll be always here to help!


Hi, my name is Marine. I’m a 3D printing executive, a graduated pastry chef, and the creator of Cakewalk 3d. I live in Paris, France.
I love innovating with food and that's why I started Cakewalk 3d, first as a side project during the spring. It all began when we were all quarantined in France, and I wanted to automate my own pastry techniques. With a mechanical engineer, we worked together remotely, each one testing and improving on its own 3D printer.  We gather our result daily, and we iterated over 3 months.
Once I started showing other pastry lovers the desserts I was getting, there was so much interest that I knew it was something I had to share with the whole 3D printing community. I worked and designed new recipes during months (mostly tested and approved by my coworkers!) and searched for the best production methods.
Even if I always want to 3D print everything, I came to the conclusion that the core parts of the extruder need to be injected. So I worked with an engineering team to select the best providers and design the molds. The campaign is aimed to raise enough money to pay these molds.
Thanks to your support, Cakewalk 3d will be soon in production, and I am really excited to share what we’ve built with the Kickstarter community.
If you’d like to see some of the designs and recipes I’ve been getting with Cakewalk 3D, you can find me on Instagram @marine_corebaillais

We have obsessed over optimizing performance, weight, and ease-of-use. This has resulted in a clamp that delivers the perfect amount of clamp force for most jobs while also being lightweight enough to easily carry, fast enough to give you a competitive advantage, and easy enough to wonder why you ever struggled manually tightening clamps before.Our Dimide HD Series Clamps and Long Series Clamps are 100% Made in the USA. Our goal is do the same for the Dimide 1/4 Series Clamps. Currently the 1/4 Series Clamps are assembled in Connecticut and the majority of the parts are Made in the USA. We have plans for custom tooling that will allow us to make the 1/4 Series Clamp 100% Made in the USA while maintaining an affordable price. The more demand we get, the easier it is to attain our Made in the USA goal for the 1/4 Series Clamps! Each clamp also ships with pre-greased screw threads, making it ready to use straight out of the box! *Reviews from the Dimide HD-Series ClampCountless people have revolutionized the way they clamp with the Dimide HD-Series Clamps.

</div><p><b>WHAT IS CURBBED?</b></p>
<p>“Curbbed” is an online buy/sell community for college
students that can be utilized across the nation for any university in any city.
 Curbbed is designed by students, for
students and is focused on ensuring the safety of all Curbbed users.</p>
<p>One of the largest benefits to this community is the
ability to list and sell your textbook at the price that you think is
fair.  Every year, students with no money
are forced to buy expensive text books, use them for a couple of months and
then sell that same exact book back to the store for next to nothing.  At Curbbed, you can post your
text book, make a price and someone taking that course next semester can purchase it from you, a
fellow student!</p>
<p>However, it doesn't stop there.  Game Systems, Couches, TVs, Appliances or
basically anything you want to sell…Just Curb it.</p>
<p><b>HOW IT WORKS</b></p>
<p>At the end of each semester, many students are found with items that no longer have any use to them. Normally, as anyone
who has driven on a college campus at the end of the semester notices, these items
are placed on the curb in hopes someone will give them a home. </p><p>This community allows its users to upload
furniture, textbooks, electronics, etc. to a profile that is tied to the university they are attending or surrounding schools and “Curb it.”  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Potential buyers can then search by the university they are
attending, or will be attending, and see which items are for sale near campus as
well as surrounding universities depending on the mile radius the user wants to
view.</span></p>
<p>The most important aspect of this community is that it’s not
like other ‘open’ buy/sell websites because only users with a .edu email address
are permitted to use the website. All communication is tracked, using a keyword tracker in all of the
messages, that will flag anything inappropriate and send it to a queue for
approval to be sent to the user.  We have
a ‘no tolerance’ policy for anything inappropriate.  We want this to be a safe and comfortable place for students.</p>
<p><b>WHAT THE FUNDS ARE FOR</b></p>
<p>We need the funds for the creation of the technology.  As students, we know that everything is done
online and even further, everything is done from a mobile device. Therefore, we
need to build a responsive website and an APP to work in conjunction with the
site and the individuals profile.  The
process on the APP is simple.  If you are
moving out, just open your Curbbed APP. 
Hit a button that says ‘post new item’, snap a picture, give the item a price and brief description. Then you are in business!</p>
<p><b>IF WE DON’T MEET THE GOAL</b></p>
<p>If we don’t meet our goal, we will use whatever funds we
have to start the development on the website and the APP.  We have partnered with a really cool design
company in Lexington called Fusioncorp. 
They understand the financial hurdles that we are facing and they are
going to be working with us on the development. 
We really hope to hit the goal because we believe in this idea and we
want to make it perfect, safe and user friendly.  This would be such a benefit to every
college campus.

<li><p><strong>How is Aura different from hand scanners? </strong>Hand scanner is different from our product due to completely different scanning technologies used (CIS vs CMOS):<br/>1.

</div></div>","bluelight  is a Virtual Stage Piano based on physical modeling technology that will leave you in awe. From realistic and powerful acoustic and electric piano sounds, to warm and engulfing Strings and Pads, to precise and penetrating analog synth sounds. The 88 keys hammer action keyboard will allow you to perform with all of the nuance and dynamics of an acoustic piano.
 
  The color touch-screen display, supported by multifunctional retro-illuminated buttons, allows for a simple and intuitive navigation of the keyboards functions; for quick, secure and precise management during live performances.
 
Three sliders allow for the control of various layered or split sounds. Pitch and Modulation wheels are also retro-illuminated to ensure visibility on the darkest of stages.
 
The piano, which is almost entirely in aluminum and carbon fiber for a total weight just over 10kg (22lbs), ensures extreme stability and robustness while also ensuring hassle-free transportation. Precise and minimalistic design, dials, buttons, sliders and aluminum wheels on an electric-blue tinted case on the top side, and classic carbon fiber texture on the underside give the piano a hi-tech and modern aspect.                                                                                                                            More than just an instrument   Why go for a bluelight ?

Consumers will save up to 20% per purchase using the SpendingShift app. Allow us to assist you in this effortless shifting of funds you are already spending: we will guide a percentage of  each purchase to an array of charities, causes, and Community Ambassadors.

SpendingShift is part of the ""Buy Local"" movement that is sweeping across American and the world.  We are a member of 120+ networks of community leaders, 30,000+ business owners, and everyday people who want to make a difference. Together, this movement works to move the economic power back into the hands of local businesses, and works to help communities bind together.








As consumers, we spend trillions of dollars each year. An average consumer spends about $70/day.


With so much money disappearing from our pockets, how much could we contribute to charity if only a small percentage of that was redirected?










Smartphones and Tablets are now a popular and easy way to make purchases on many different platforms. Notice how everyone is looking down nowadays? Why not utilize this trend to help others?














We're creating a platform that will redirect a portion of those trillions back into your hands. Start small by shifting $5/day to support local businesses. Have lunch at your favorite cafe and spend no more than you usually would--and let SpendingShift show you your impact.






























Simply pay with your phone at your favorite local businesses on the things you already spend money on.  


                        


Every Voucher you buy will generate funds for local charities as well as funds for SpendingShift Ambassadors, people like you, to help them do good.  









Not only will you be helping people with your spending--you'll also save, by taking advantage of the discounts offered by our awesome merchants. You also get the satisfaction that your personal spending generates funds for other Community Ambassadors so they can do MORE.

Help Bruno Serato, 2011 CNN Hero, feed Millions of kids.  Many restaurants across the United States, and around the world, want to help Bruno feed the under-privileged kids in their own communities, but lack the funding.  With the funding from this campaign, we can help Bruno and give money to the above restaurants, so they can start NOW.  After that, SpendingShift’s perpetual funding-raising platform will maintain the kindness sharing, for the long haul.  When the economy crashed, Bruno’s fine-dining restaurant business like many others fell by 40-50%, however, due to the bad economy the under-privileged kids doubled.  Keeping the restaurant open and meeting financial obligations were a challenge, let alone feeding the 300-600 children every night.  It was a decision whether to risk losing the restaurant or cut-back on feeding the kids.  “God told me to keep feeding the kids,” so he took out a 2nd mortgage on his home.  There are so many worthy causes for SpendingShift to support, but having the fortunate opportunity to spend time with Bruno and see what he and his dedicated staffs do, we decided to put Bruno’s initiative as one our 2 “Flagship” campaigns to rally support and get funding.   
Drew Logan 
Celebrity Trainer, Fitness & Nutrition Expert, Athlete, 3-Time Sudden Cardiac Arrest Survivor, and Spokesperson.Every year, nearly 7,000 healthy kids (K-12) die from Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA), and this toll is rising annually. However, there are no federal government mandates that requires life-saving defibrillation devices in schools nationwide, like there are  for Fire Extinguishers. Interestingly though, do you know how many deaths have occurred due to school fires in the past half century? Zero! None! Not a single one! That's right... yet tax payers are paying millions every year for extinguishers and inspections.While SCA is the leading cause of deaths in children K-12 by an overwhelming margin, most school boards, and councils, cite the cost of Automatic External Defibrillator (AED's) as the reason for not demanding they be installed as prevalently as the obviously obsolete fire extinguishers.With SpendingShift's help, and your use in your daily purchasing, my ""Angel Hearts"" Initiative will receive helpful funds every time you purchase using your smartphone APP. Together we can make the financial obstacles of the schools boards a non-issue by providing AED's to them for free...everywhere there are children! Kids deserve a chance at a full life!Please support SpendingShift and help us save lives!-Drew LoganDrew Logan was 30 years old and in the best shape of his life.  So why did he suddenly die--three times in one night?  New research may finally be unlocking the answers to the mystery of sudden cardiac arrest... (Read full story)

<p><i><strong>Because indiegogo update their payment system and no support china get usd money.Unfortunately that i start my project with usd money,so my project will be close at 31,21,2019 and after you can't buy on indiegogo.</strong></i></p>

<h2>Why Make A Third Cooling Mod</h2>
<p>GPD Win2 is the best Win10 handheld game console you can get right now. The official default thermal design power is 7w TDP, but if you want to get the best performance of Win2, you need use 12w TDP to run it. But CPU will be very hot when use 12w TDP, so I redesigned a cooling module to replace the original cooling module, make you can run for a long time with 12w TPD, and CPU also can get very low temperature.Also you can get lower back shell temperature that make your game feel better.</p>
<p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544077955/cjkotk9ifnbxmer9mzus.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>PS: All test is use aida64 software,if you use conductonaut will get better result.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Gaming upgrades with higher TDP</h2>
<p>When Win2 running the official 7w TDP, you can't use the GPU and CPU 100%, which means you can't play all of its performance. And when you use 10w+ TDP, you will get 100% GPU performance than can get  5~10 fps boost for your game. Of course, you also can run with 12w TDP to get 100% performance GPU and CPU, but after testing, for most games, this can't get fps upgrade. So we recommend use 10w TDP to play game that can get same game effects but longer game time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>About Support And Order Setting</h2>
<p>Because win2 have many version but indiegogo functional limit, so after you pay you need login my website to set some information so can get right item. Like your win2 version, which shell do you want get, and you also can view your shipping information.</p>
<p><i><strong>It should be reminded that SSD Cooling Kit is a separate product, which is not included in the default Copper Nylon Shell, You need to purchase it separately.</strong></i></p>
<p>My website is <a href=""https://gpd.kntropy.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://gpd.kntropy.net</a>, <strong>the default user name is your indiegogo email, default password is your email+first order id(support my project)</strong>. For example, if your email is example@gmail.com and you support my project first order no is 110, your username is example@gmail.com and passowrd is example@gmail.com110.</p>
<p>Because i need to synchronize data, <strong>I suggest you login to my website the next day or the third day after you purchase</strong>, because I will synchronize the system data every night, this time you should can login. If you still can't login or have any problem please send me email and i will help you, my email is smufeng@gmail.com.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>About Three Back Shell</h2>
<p>We provide three different shells, all shell use nylon and have the same performance and only have different appearances. <strong>If you don't login to my website and choose the shell skin, I will ship it to you randomly.</strong></p>
<p>In the order shown below, the skin is <strong>original, leather, woollen</strong>. Need to be reminded that the woollen feel is best and very very good, but it is easier to get dirty.</p>

<h2>Installation Tutorial</h2>
<p>The installation tutorial is relatively long and has been made into a PDF. Because I don't know other languages, I only provide both Chinese and English versions. If users are willing to help, I can provide word source files for translation.</p>
<p>The installation tutorial shows a version with SSD cooling mod. <strong>SSD cooling mod needs to be purchased separately.</strong> If you do not purchase, you do not need to perform the SSD installation steps. The other parts are the same.</p>
<p>The accessories may change in subsequent shipments, please understand.<strong>And because the liquid metal thermal paste will corrode the aluminum, do not apply it in the copper and aluminum contact position, only for the CPU position.</strong></p>

<h2>Mod Shell Install Demonstration</h2>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/L4S9RypsZfY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""> </div>
<div>I have found some problems with the installation of people's shells. If the shell is not perfect after installation, for example, the USB is not fully stuck in the slot, you can try the installation as follows.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>First, as in the video, press the grounding pad to ensure that the USB can snap into the slot. After confirming that the USB is properly installed in the buckle,make sure that the buckles on the back of the case are in the correct position. And then confirm that the SSD cooling switch is installed properly. Finally, press the front of the casing to ensure that all the buckles of the casing are properly engaged to complete the installation.</div>
<p> </p>
<h2>Only Buy Cooling Mod User Help</h2>
<p>For those user who only buy cooling mod, here are some tips for installing mod. First of all, you need to sharpen the position of the yellow frame below, and otherwise you can not install the mod, also pay attention to the red frame position needs more sanding. Then there are some information below that will allow you to better polish the case to install the mod.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555247541/ajnozoebgufspa15gl2h.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If you have a table saw in your home, you can cut the red frame directly according to the picture below, so that you only need lite polish it and can install the mod perfectly. After cutting, please trim the matching 304 upper cover according to the cutting shape.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555247566/vmzurtde3cpj1iwqauff.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555247580/fr8x4snipigwgzjroqk9.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In addition, be sure to open the second cooling hole, otherwise it will affect the effect. At the same time, in order to make it easier for you to polish, I made a 1:1 shell polishing diagram. You can download the file and print it out at the end of the text. Then stick it on the outer casing and align it, so it will be much easier to polish and the position will not be too much deviation.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555247630/bhqo4hvr7kv8m6f5hjzn.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Finally, it is recommended that the screws in the following positions should not be installed, because the screws will increase the height by 0.5mm, which means that if you install the screws in these positions, you need to grind 0.5mm. Therefore, it is recommended not to install, or directly grind the screw position according to the following figure, so that no large-area grinding is required. If you have tools, you can cut the part directly according to the suggestions above.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555247684/trwsyla9lyrmdvln6nop.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h2>Thanks To</h2>
<p>To begin with, we thank all gamers who join in this crowdfunding campaign. It is your continuous support that allows my ideas to be realized and more people to get it.</p>
<p>In the end, this is my first attempt at crowdfunding, so there are still many places that I don't understand. I hope that everyone can be more tolerant and understanding.</p>

Of course, you also can run with 12w TDP to get 100% performance GPU and CPU, but after testing, for most games, this can't get fps upgrade. So we recommend use 10w TDP to play game that can get same game effects but longer game time.

 
About Support And Order Setting
Because win2 have many version but indiegogo functional limit, so after you pay you need login my website to set some information so can get right item. Like your win2 version, which shell do you want get, and you also can view your shipping information.
It should be reminded that SSD Cooling Kit is a separate product, which is not included in the default Copper Nylon Shell, You need to purchase it separately.
My website is https://gpd.kntropy.net, the default user name is your indiegogo email, default password is your email+first order id(support my project). For example, if your email is example@gmail.com and you support my project first order no is 110, your username is example@gmail.com and passowrd is example@gmail.com110.
Because i need to synchronize data, I suggest you login to my website the next day or the third day after you purchase, because I will synchronize the system data every night, this time you should can login. If you still can't login or have any problem please send me email and i will help you, my email is smufeng@gmail.com.
 
About Three Back Shell
We provide three different shells, all shell use nylon and have the same performance and only have different appearances. If you don't login to my website and choose the shell skin, I will ship it to you randomly.
In the order shown below, the skin is original, leather, woollen. Need to be reminded that the woollen feel is best and very very good, but it is easier to get dirty.



 
I have also support 2280 shell,it can make you use 2280 SSD for win2,the shell is 3D print with nylon,and you need buy adapter to use,the adapter link is on below.The 3D file i have also public on my website,you can download and print with your self.



Riser PCI-e x1 to NGFF M2 Key B NVMe SSD Adapter
GPD Win2 2280 Shell STL File
The 2280 install simple is below，first you need cut adapter so can enter the slot，then you need use double-sided tape to fix the adapter.




 
Installation Tutorial
The installation tutorial is relatively long and has been made into a PDF. Because I don't know other languages, I only provide both Chinese and English versions. If users are willing to help, I can provide word source files for translation.
The installation tutorial shows a version with SSD cooling mod. SSD cooling mod needs to be purchased separately. If you do not purchase, you do not need to perform the SSD installation steps. The other parts are the same.
The accessories may change in subsequent shipments, please understand.And because the liquid metal thermal paste will corrode the aluminum, do not apply it in the copper and aluminum contact position, only for the CPU position.

Mod Shell Install Demonstration

 
I have found some problems with the installation of people's shells. If the shell is not perfect after installation, for example, the USB is not fully stuck in the slot, you can try the installation as follows.
 
First, as in the video, press the grounding pad to ensure that the USB can snap into the slot. After confirming that the USB is properly installed in the buckle,make sure that the buckles on the back of the case are in the correct position. And then confirm that the SSD cooling switch is installed properly. Finally, press the front of the casing to ensure that all the buckles of the casing are properly engaged to complete the installation.
 
Only Buy Cooling Mod User Help
For those user who only buy cooling mod, here are some tips for installing mod. First of all, you need to sharpen the position of the yellow frame below, and otherwise you can not install the mod, also pay attention to the red frame position needs more sanding. Then there are some information below that will allow you to better polish the case to install the mod.

If you have a table saw in your home, you can cut the red frame directly according to the picture below, so that you only need lite polish it and can install the mod perfectly. After cutting, please trim the matching 304 upper cover according to the cutting shape.


In addition, be sure to open the second cooling hole, otherwise it will affect the effect. At the same time, in order to make it easier for you to polish, I made a 1:1 shell polishing diagram. You can download the file and print it out at the end of the text. Then stick it on the outer casing and align it, so it will be much easier to polish and the position will not be too much deviation.

Finally, it is recommended that the screws in the following positions should not be installed, because the screws will increase the height by 0.5mm, which means that if you install the screws in these positions, you need to grind 0.5mm. Therefore, it is recommended not to install, or directly grind the screw position according to the following figure, so that no large-area grinding is required. If you have tools, you can cut the part directly according to the suggestions above.

<h3>Guided, Customized Writing Plans</h3>
<p>Our goal is to help you break down your writing project into achievable steps. But sometimes, you just don’t know where to begin. So we built <strong>Smart Projects</strong>: Guided writing plans focused on specific types of writing that help you start and finish your project.</p>
<p>Each Smart Project contains <strong>customizable milestones and tasks with smart tips to guide you</strong> throughout. We offer smart projects for <strong>blogging, expository essays, letters to Congress, novels, and short stories</strong> - and we’re adding more all the time based on your feedback. With your support, we can build a greater library of subjects, work with experts to offer customized plans, and help expand your writing horizons to keep you engaged on the page.</p>

<h3>A Quick Story...</h3>
<p>The idea behind TheRightMargin was started by Shivani Bhargava in 2014. Though she comes from a health tech background, Shivani began fiddling with some ideas to make writing easier because she was sick of the status quo writing tools available to her for her professional and personal writing. It felt silly to Shivani that with the technology available to us today, we were all stuck typing on a flat, 2-D piece of paper that's just been put on a screen. And though tools like MS Word and Google Docs have had their time, it was time to move the act of writing into the future.</p>
<p>Her vision is to build the most intelligent writing experience in the world so that the momentum and morale blockers people feel today don't stand in the way of expression, communication and innovation tomorrow. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Crux</h2>
<p>Imagine being able to stay as inspired, motivated and accomplished from beginning to end on any writing project. Imagine improving the quality of your writing by tailored guidance and resources when and if you need them--based on what you're writing about. This isn't a writing coach. Or a class. It's a smart writing tool that aims to take a lot of burden off your shoulders so you can focus on producing great and inspiring content.</p>
<p>We already have an awesome goal-driven writing tool available for anyone to use. Help us take the next level up in our technology. Help us make it smarter and more seamless. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQs</h2>
<p><strong>Can I try out TheRightMargin? Are you already available online?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. <a href=""https://www.therightmargin.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sign up</a> for a free 14-day trial anytime and get the full TRM experience! No credit card is required to sign up.</p>
<p><strong>Is TheRightMargin available on my mobile device?</strong></p>
<p>It’s on our roadmap and your contribution will make it happen sooner! Let us know what you’d like to see by filling out this short survey here.</p>
<p><strong>Where is my writing saved?</strong></p>
<p>Your writing is saved to the cloud. Every time your writing autosaves, our database will capture your latest edits and we save the 10 latest drafts in our database for an extra layer of protection. We use Heroku as our database service currently.</p>
<p><strong>Can anyone see my writing?</strong></p>
<p>No. TheRightMargin is your personal writing and planning workspace, so everything you write is private. Our entire site is secured with SSL to protect your data. The only exceptions to this are if you choose to share your credentials with people and/or if our customer support team dives into the database to assist you with an issue.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>What does AI for writing mean?</strong></p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence is intelligence exhibited by machines. In some simple ways, TheRightMargin is already artificially intelligent because of smart keyword recognition that happens in the back end when serving up ‘smart tips’ for tasks or when it calculates the math in helping you break down your goals for project setup.</p>
<p>However, we’d like to make this much more robust. A level up would be to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to feed TheRightMargin with more data on writer goals, pain points, tips and guidance so that the tailored guidance on the app is even better and helpful.</p>
<p>So imagine indicating to TheRightMargin your goals, your challenges and the specifics about a particular project and it serving up to you the best ways to get unblocked, to get the notes/research/information you need to write, to plan and to achieve your writing goals.</p>
<p>Another level up would be to move writing off a web application completely. We want to move writing into the future and it’s possible that someone a few years from now would be working with VR/AR tech instead of laptops and phones. In summary, we want TheRightMargin to take all the wondrous benefits that cutting edge AI technology can offer us to improve how we write on a daily basis.</p>
<p><strong>Do you offer academic pricing?</strong></p>
<p>Please get in touch at support@therightmargin.com. We always want to encourage and support academic writing and would love to pilot it with your academic organization.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the difference between the subscriptions?</strong></p>
<p>There is no difference in features or experience. There is simply a discount for committing to a longer membership. Committing to your writing for a full year is a better deal than paying for a quarter or going month-to-month.</p>
<p><strong>How do I cancel my subscription?</strong></p>
<p>With one click from your account page. If you suspend/cancel a subscription plan, you’ll have access to your workspace until your current billing cycle runs out. You won’t be charged unless you choose to reactivate your subscription or choose another plan.</p>
<p><strong>How do I get my writing out once my subscription isn't active?</strong></p>
<p>Even if you don't have an active subscription, you won't be locked out of your projects dashboard and account settings. You should be able to export all your writing through your projects dashboard. And if you run into any difficulties, just hit us up at support@therightmargin.com. We'll help you out!</p>

What is TheRightMargin?
We are a writing web app (yep, that means we're on the cloud) that is changing how people write. Gone are the days of word processors that simply put a piece of paper on a screen. Say hello to a completely fresh approach to getting your writing done...
 
A Beautiful and Clean Writing Interface
Step into the future of writing with our fresh design.

 
Start with your Goals First
Every project setup experience smartly breaks down ambitious writing goals into actionable milestones and tasks.
                           
One of the number one reasons people don't finish their work is because they don't know what to do next. Our goal-driven project setup helps you break down your large, undefinable writing goals into smaller, more achievable steps. This process sets you up for success and it's proven that people with written goals are more likely to achieve them.
 
The All-in-one Writing Workspace 
Write alongside your plan to always know what’s next.

Switching between writing and planning tools interrupts your flow so our all-in-one workspace protects your context from distractions. Within your timeline, you can add notes, outlines, research and other supplementary bits of information for any particular project. When your writing lives next to your plan, you’ll always know what you’ve accomplished and what’s left to do—making your writing journey more achievable and enjoyable.

 
Smart Guidance to Get Unstuck and Finish
For particular tasks and goals, TheRightMargin smartly suggests tips on how to move forward. Our experience is like a coach who has your back and wants you to succeed. But this is just a first pass. Help us build AI behind the guidance and suggestions to make the experience even more useful.
With your backing, we could learn which advice performs best, use the best expertise to train the tool, and help every writer on TheRightMargin write better tasks that have the best chance of being completed.

 
Seamlessly Work on Multiple Writing Projects
TheRightMargin easily accommodates the writer who has many types of writing projects.

While most writing tools throw you into a blank document, we take a more holistic approach. Our elegant projects page will keep you focused on your upcoming milestones and even remind you if you've missed a few (because hey, we're only human). It's perfect for the busy writer working on multiple, different pieces with different requirements and deadlines. We use it ourselves to manage everything we write and plan to write.
 
Catch Up Easily
We get it. Life gets in the way. Progress is #winning in our books so we make it easy to change your plan as you go along so you can continue to accomplish without feeling lost or behind.

 
Guided, Customized Writing Plans
Our goal is to help you break down your writing project into achievable steps. But sometimes, you just don’t know where to begin. So we built Smart Projects: Guided writing plans focused on specific types of writing that help you start and finish your project.
Each Smart Project contains customizable milestones and tasks with smart tips to guide you throughout. We offer smart projects for blogging, expository essays, letters to Congress, novels, and short stories - and we’re adding more all the time based on your feedback. With your support, we can build a greater library of subjects, work with experts to offer customized plans, and help expand your writing horizons to keep you engaged on the page.
Some examples:
 
Get Involved and Affect Change with our Advocacy tool
""My Letter to Congress"" Smart Project

 
Build your Blog with Expert Guidance
""My Blog Post"" Smart Project

 
Follow Through on Inspiration and Finish your Creative Writing
""My Short Story"" Smart Project

 
Write More in Less Time with our Built-in Timer


Timed writing exercises are an incredible tactic for breaking through writing blocks, and meeting your writing goals. But most tools recommend you go elsewhere to find them. Not us. To help keep you focused, and on track toward finishing, we built a timer into TheRightMargin. Use the timer to write more words in less time, increase your writing output, and break through writer's block.
 
...but wait, there's more.

My
name is Guy Gonen and I am an espresso systems expert with over 20 years of lab and field experience. Through the years, I learned that the espresso machine is solely responsible for 40% of the average coffee shop's electric bill.<p>Avelon was founded to introduce novel solutions to the high power consumption and maintance costs of today's professional espresso machines. We develop technology which can be applied in a variety of
household and industrial water heating devices.</p><p><span><span>Currently, we are at
the prototype stage with two working espresso machines. We further developed our technology and are ready to build a third fully functional prototype.</span></span></p><p>At the global scale, our green water heating technology has the potential to save a great deal of energy and help preserve our planet.</p><p>Avelon's solution eliminates the requirement for harmful filters and water softeners used to fight limescale buildup, and as such reduces the overall enviromental negative impact. <br/><br/>Our heating technology achieves significant power consumption reduction by the use of a unique light emmiting heating element. The elegant design is simple to implement and found to be effective in a variety of water heating devices. Avelon's solution is less expensive to manufacture and has a longer lifespan then other currently available technology in the market. To the consumer, this directly translates to lower costs and reduction in waste - efficiency both economically and ecologically. <br/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FLo0m-CrZBUM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DLo0m-CrZBUM&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLo0m-CrZBUM%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p><a href=""http://youtu.be/Lo0m-CrZBUM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youtu.be/Lo0m-CrZBUM</a><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/728840/files/20140719083112-aplaince.jpg?1405783872"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/><p><b>Basic principle of operation</b></p>
<p>The heating elements of water heating machines suffer from deposit
build-up as a result of direct contact with water. As hard water evaporates, it
leaves behind unsightly and hard to clean deposits, also known as limescale.</p>
<p>Limescale seriously impairs the operation of heating systems and
damages various machine components.</p>
<p>Unlike current water heaters which make use of metal and ceramic based
heating elements, Avelon utilizes a revolutionary and safe heat based heating array which holds a halogen heat bulb at its
core. The halogen core produces short wave length rays. This visible spectrum
energy is absorbed as heat by the water. The halogen bulb is insulated from the
water and is inherently cheaper and more efficient than older direct contact
heating elements.</p>
<p>The advantages of this technology are clear:</p>
<p>  - Lower energy use</p>
<p>  - Lower carbon footprint
= a cleaner environment</p>
<p>  - Lower repair cost</p>
<p>  - Lower operation costs</p>
<p>Replacement of the halogen heat bulb is simple and easy:</p>
<p>  1. Open the heating
element lid.</p>
<p>  2. Replace the heat bulb.</p>
<p>There is no need for a technician. If you can replace light bulb you
can replace the halogen heat bulb.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the Avelon heat bulb never comes in contact with
the water, it is not affected by limescale*. There is no need for water
softeners or use of dedicated water filtration devices. The by-products of such
filters are polluting our environment.</p>
<p>* Avelon array utilizes an electromagnetic device to prevent limescale build-up.</p>
<p>Since Avelon does not require filtration, we can keep our environment
cleaner.</p>
<p>Currently, we at Avelon are in the process of developing our third
professional espresso machine prototype.</p>
<p>Our technologies and innovations for industrial applications will save

My
name is Guy Gonen and I am an espresso systems expert with over 20 years of lab and field experience. Through the years, I learned that the espresso machine is solely responsible for 40% of the average coffee shop's electric bill.Avelon was founded to introduce novel solutions to the high power consumption and maintance costs of today's professional espresso machines. We develop technology which can be applied in a variety of
household and industrial water heating devices.Currently, we are at
the prototype stage with two working espresso machines. We further developed our technology and are ready to build a third fully functional prototype.At the global scale, our green water heating technology has the potential to save a great deal of energy and help preserve our planet.Avelon's solution eliminates the requirement for harmful filters and water softeners used to fight limescale buildup, and as such reduces the overall enviromental negative impact. Our heating technology achieves significant power consumption reduction by the use of a unique light emmiting heating element. The elegant design is simple to implement and found to be effective in a variety of water heating devices. Avelon's solution is less expensive to manufacture and has a longer lifespan then other currently available technology in the market. To the consumer, this directly translates to lower costs and reduction in waste - efficiency both economically and ecologically. http://youtu.be/Lo0m-CrZBUM
Using Avelon technology for water heating systems saves up to 50% power!Why is it important to all of us?It is important for me on both a global and personal level to preserve our planet for the future of the children, especially since my first born child is going to be born soon. We all want to reduce our electricity consumption and save money on our electricity bills.The European Union declares: water heating appliances are the biggest energy consumers at a global level.We can save €1,800,000,000  ($ 2,434,000,000)  in electricity power per year in Europe alone!Now think how much electricity and money we can save all around the world.http://www.topten.info/uploads/images/upload/075_Eric_Bush_final_paper.pdf

</ul></div>","There are dozens upon dozens of mechanical keyboards available, however, most of them are made for gamers, and they are bulky and mediocre, compromising beauty in favour of functionality. Rymek is designed with inspiration from typewriters in the 50s, giving you that clicking sensation under your fingers as you type.Rymek comes with distinguished saddle-shape keycaps, with Cherry/Gateron switches, a modern switch that emulates the typewriter clicky feel. It supports all OS and works flawlessly on most devices. Users can easily switch between 3 devices using the Bluetooth mode. Not to mention its stunning dynamic backlit that can brighten the night and light up your happiness.   Rymek is the perfect amalgam of past, present, and future by blending classic design with ultra-modern features.Rymek comes with ergonomically saddle-shape keycaps; the glossy surface is beautiful as well as durable. All keys are arranged for comfortable operation from a default position, which boosts not only typing speed but also accuracy. Rymek features a stainless steel stent to secure your phone or tablet while typing. Rymek adopts Bluetooth 3.0 and supports iOS, Android, macOS and Windows(With Bluetooth feature) with a highly stable connection. You can pair with 3 devices and easily switch with shortcuts. Unlike regular keyboards, mechanical keyboards give you specific tactile feedback on button presses, and the most accurate and reliable performance that typist and gamers will truly appreciate.  Rymek features both Blue and Brown Switches to meet the needs of mechanical keyboard enthusiasts. Difference between Gateron Blue Switch and Cherry MX Blue SwitchBoth Gateron and Cherry are experienced manufacturies in mechanical switches. Both Blue switches are clicky, easy to type, responsive and generate typewriter sound. For typing experience, most people would say Gaterons are smoother than Cherry MXs, and that Gateron Blues click louder and brighter than MXs. Comparison videos as below: Gateron Blue Switch Cherry MX Blue Switch  Cherry MX Brown SwitchCherry MX Brown Switch is responsive and offers users the tactile bump feeling but smaller clicking sound. Its silent travel makes sure you won’t bother anyone in the same room; a perfect choice for office users. Rymek comes with dynamic backlit keys, something you rarely get to see in a wireless keyboard. Rymek offers 5 brightness levels(0%~100%), 7 light effects, 4 dynamic speed for choice. You can also turn off the backlit as needed.​​Rymek also supports USB connection, so you can use Rymek with your Windows, Linux OS or other operating system computer. We also design dual USB port so that Rymek can better suit your setup. Simply use its vintage handle to switch between Bluetooth and USB mode.  The design inspiration of the scroll knob comes from vintage manual typewriter; it serves a volume controller plus as an on/off switch. You can also use the multimedia key to control the music. Rymek comes with a rechargeable 2000 mAh battery that will last 50 hours on a single charge, allowing users to enjoy the Bluetooth connectivity freely.*Note: Turning on the backlight effects will increase power consumption. Written language is a manifestation of thoughts and communications, a symbol of human civilization. From Oracle bone script, brush calligraphy to typewriting; we are in the era of digitalization. Rymek is eager to engage in the sociocultural evolution, embracing your nostalgia with retro tech. Rymek features two colours :Classy Black Caramel White The default keycaps installed on every Rymek keyboard is the macOS layout.

The printer switches colors by purging the difference in a little bin (just like your inkjet) or to reduce the waist the transition can happen inside the infill area of the print provided that it's large enough. The RoVa4D has 3 separate hot ends.  One is capable of printing in any color, hue, tone, tint or shade.

(Well that's not really about the printer but we solved that problem anyway.) In the past in order to produce a multi-colored part you would need to have a model that would have multiple segments. The printer wouldn’t know which color was loaded into a particular extruder, so you had to make sure it was loaded with the correct color into the correct extruder. Once that was done you then assigned that extruder to a particular part, so that when it was printing that part of the model the printer would use that extruder and therefore that color would come through. You almost have to be a graphic design artist in order to be able to do that.</p><p>With our Simplified Work Flow, what we have done is make it so that you can take any single body model (like the millions that are available on Thingiverse and on the web), and color them in one of 2 ways:</p><p>1.) You can simply wrap any picture onto the model - you can take a photo or something you have designed in Photoshop like a logo, and wrap it onto any shape like a vase, block, etc.</p><p>2.) You can paint the model with a size variable brush using a color picking wheel, and selecting the color in the computer, virtually painting it so that when you print it – it will print in those exact colors. You don’t need to switch out the filaments to get those colors. You simply leave the CMYKW loaded in the machine, ready to print. The printer knows which color is in each of the extruders and it knows which extruder is for cyan, which is for magenta, etc. It combines in the ratio that is required for that color into the mixing chamber where it is mixed/blended together to produce the new color, and that is what comes out of the nozzle and is what is printed.  We've made it really easy to make ANY 3D model into a multi-color model. It's so easy that anyone can do it. It's as simple as:</p><p><i><b>1) Pick your model 2) Paint the model 3) Print the model</b></i></p><div data-id=""13041005""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1471553184/qtit81htlde2e0ldtdm7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p>Just 3 simple steps and every model is a full color model! You will find that the process is not only fun but also easy enough for a child to use.

It is not just an all metal frame. It is ¼ inch aerospace grade aluminum, anodized to perfection and reinforced by a ½ inch aluminum internal frame with rear metal cross braces (Like how you would reinforce the back end of a racing car.) We do all of this so that you can run it really fast with a head that is fed with 7 separate extruders without it wobbling around – it is still rock solid.</p><p>We are incorporating what we learned over 6 generations of 3d printer designs to improve the basic geometry of the printer to get the maximum build volume into the minimum foot print.</p><div data-id=""13173370""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1471553189/y9lylmo1rnetsdgc3sii.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p><b>Enclosure:</b> One of the other things that customers asked for was a smaller enclosure, so we went to a core x/y system , so that it’s not only a smaller enclosure but now the print bed only moves up and down on the z and the print head moves in the x/y axis. Core x/y is more accurate and more repeatable than any other linear motion system.</p><p>The enclosure is part of the printer and further stiffens the entire chassis. The printer is also impact tested according to the safety standards for use in a home, school, or office. The enclosure is also lockable and will fail in a locked position. If it is hot inside it will not be allowed to open until the printer is stationary and cooled down. </p><p><b>Gears &amp; Pulleys:  </b>We don’t 3D print the components that are on our printers, we have them injection molded or machined from aluminum. That makes them significantly stronger. All of our gears are stainless steel, our pulleys are metal, the belts we use are designed for linear motion.</p><div data-id=""13173757""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1471553189/eizrr4dib0r9yeyofje5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""13172843""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1471553190/urooheityecj6wliniib.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p><b>Hot ends:</b> Our hot ends are also made of aluminum so they heat up very quickly. They have powerful heaters in them, and our nozzles are zinc coated copper, so they are durable as well as great heat conductors. The best that any metal can be. And they seal more easily and don’t leak, because they use a proprietary gasket technology to seal them.</p><p><b>Dedicated Nozzles</b>: There is a dedicated nozzle for support material and one for flexible material.  The reason these are separate is because the base polymers of different materials don’t play nicely with the PLA of the full color nozzles. In order to print completely different materials they have to be separate hot ends.  We have engineered them to have the best optimal performance for those particular materials. Our Ninjaflex extruder and hot end were engineered specifically to print in flexible materials. They print easily and fast. If you were to mix them into our full color hot end, they would need to be printed at such vastly different temperatures that it would be impossible. Because we have separate hot ends and because of our liquid cooling system we are able to keep each of the hot ends at precisely the temperature that they are set to. The dissolvable support material hot end can be at 160 Celsius, and the full color hot end can be at 210. The liquid cooling system is so efficient it will allow them to maintain that precise separation between their temperatures. Having three hot ends that are dedicated to different materials will allow you to print materials that are completely incompatible with each other, all in the same print.</p><p><b>Liquid Cooling:</b> All hot ends have a hot and a cold section and our competition uses air cooling which leads to jamming problems. The enclosure is sealed so it gets hot inside, this helps to prevent warping of the printed parts but if you use a fan to cool the hot end inside the enclosure you are just blowing hot air.  We employ a liquid cooling system that circulates cold water through the hot end, and pumps the heat out of the enclosure where it is cooled in an external radiator (kind of like your car).  This is far more efficient than a fan, and eliminates issues like jamming that our competition suffers from.</p><div data-id=""13172777""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1471553191/ojaqymsnpjicqzyzknfh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p><b>Build Volume:</b> You can print any object that is up to 12 inches x 12 inches x 18 inches. The actual build volume on the X/Y is closer to 12.5 inches. Why? Because you can’t use 12 inches on the X/Y/Z if it is actually only 12 inches, as you cannot print right on the edge. So we are giving you a buffer so that you can actually print 12 x 12 x 18 inches.</p><div data-id=""13172787""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472050747/knfadg5jy2bbudeslxea.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p><b>Geckotek Plates</b>: They are interchangeable plates for different materials so you don’t have to prepare the beds yourself, and after the print is finished if you are going to do multiple back to back prints you can leave the bed hot, take the plate off to cool down, and put another plate on and just keep printing.

The printer wouldn’t know which color was loaded into a particular extruder, so you had to make sure it was loaded with the correct color into the correct extruder. Once that was done you then assigned that extruder to a particular part, so that when it was printing that part of the model the printer would use that extruder and therefore that color would come through. You almost have to be a graphic design artist in order to be able to do that.With our Simplified Work Flow, what we have done is make it so that you can take any single body model (like the millions that are available on Thingiverse and on the web), and color them in one of 2 ways:1.) You can simply wrap any picture onto the model - you can take a photo or something you have designed in Photoshop like a logo, and wrap it onto any shape like a vase, block, etc.2.) You can paint the model with a size variable brush using a color picking wheel, and selecting the color in the computer, virtually painting it so that when you print it – it will print in those exact colors. You don’t need to switch out the filaments to get those colors. You simply leave the CMYKW loaded in the machine, ready to print. The printer knows which color is in each of the extruders and it knows which extruder is for cyan, which is for magenta, etc. It combines in the ratio that is required for that color into the mixing chamber where it is mixed/blended together to produce the new color, and that is what comes out of the nozzle and is what is printed.  We've made it really easy to make ANY 3D model into a multi-color model. It's so easy that anyone can do it. It's as simple as:1) Pick your model 2) Paint the model 3) Print the model Just 3 simple steps and every model is a full color model! You will find that the process is not only fun but also easy enough for a child to use. Now everyone can easily use this new printer to create full color 3D prints even if they aren't a graphic designer.Example of Painting a Gecko: More models painted and ready to print: Some sample prints: Working on Color Matching: We Love a Challenge:Prototype Video Footage:   Commercial Quality at Maker Prices:If you have seen our printers before you know our printers are made to last, and that every component of our printers has been custom engineered. The Frame: The printer frame is STRONG! It is not just an all metal frame. It is ¼ inch aerospace grade aluminum, anodized to perfection and reinforced by a ½ inch aluminum internal frame with rear metal cross braces (Like how you would reinforce the back end of a racing car.) We do all of this so that you can run it really fast with a head that is fed with 7 separate extruders without it wobbling around – it is still rock solid.We are incorporating what we learned over 6 generations of 3d printer designs to improve the basic geometry of the printer to get the maximum build volume into the minimum foot print. Enclosure: One of the other things that customers asked for was a smaller enclosure, so we went to a core x/y system , so that it’s not only a smaller enclosure but now the print bed only moves up and down on the z and the print head moves in the x/y axis. Core x/y is more accurate and more repeatable than any other linear motion system.The enclosure is part of the printer and further stiffens the entire chassis. The printer is also impact tested according to the safety standards for use in a home, school, or office. The enclosure is also lockable and will fail in a locked position. If it is hot inside it will not be allowed to open until the printer is stationary and cooled down. Gears & Pulleys:  We don’t 3D print the components that are on our printers, we have them injection molded or machined from aluminum. That makes them significantly stronger. All of our gears are stainless steel, our pulleys are metal, the belts we use are designed for linear motion.  Hot ends: Our hot ends are also made of aluminum so they heat up very quickly. They have powerful heaters in them, and our nozzles are zinc coated copper, so they are durable as well as great heat conductors. The best that any metal can be. And they seal more easily and don’t leak, because they use a proprietary gasket technology to seal them.Dedicated Nozzles: There is a dedicated nozzle for support material and one for flexible material.  The reason these are separate is because the base polymers of different materials don’t play nicely with the PLA of the full color nozzles. In order to print completely different materials they have to be separate hot ends.  We have engineered them to have the best optimal performance for those particular materials. Our Ninjaflex extruder and hot end were engineered specifically to print in flexible materials. They print easily and fast. If you were to mix them into our full color hot end, they would need to be printed at such vastly different temperatures that it would be impossible. Because we have separate hot ends and because of our liquid cooling system we are able to keep each of the hot ends at precisely the temperature that they are set to. The dissolvable support material hot end can be at 160 Celsius, and the full color hot end can be at 210. The liquid cooling system is so efficient it will allow them to maintain that precise separation between their temperatures. Having three hot ends that are dedicated to different materials will allow you to print materials that are completely incompatible with each other, all in the same print.Liquid Cooling: All hot ends have a hot and a cold section and our competition uses air cooling which leads to jamming problems. The enclosure is sealed so it gets hot inside, this helps to prevent warping of the printed parts but if you use a fan to cool the hot end inside the enclosure you are just blowing hot air.  We employ a liquid cooling system that circulates cold water through the hot end, and pumps the heat out of the enclosure where it is cooled in an external radiator (kind of like your car).  This is far more efficient than a fan, and eliminates issues like jamming that our competition suffers from. Build Volume: You can print any object that is up to 12 inches x 12 inches x 18 inches. The actual build volume on the X/Y is closer to 12.5 inches. Why? Because you can’t use 12 inches on the X/Y/Z if it is actually only 12 inches, as you cannot print right on the edge. So we are giving you a buffer so that you can actually print 12 x 12 x 18 inches. Geckotek Plates: They are interchangeable plates for different materials so you don’t have to prepare the beds yourself, and after the print is finished if you are going to do multiple back to back prints you can leave the bed hot, take the plate off to cool down, and put another plate on and just keep printing. Print materials stick so well there is no warping or delamination that can occur on the bed – it’s amazing and we love this product - which is why we are including it in every order.RoVa3D Full Color Blender Features:Some of the amazing features of the RoVa4D include: automatic bed leveling, auto nozzle height control, electronic offset control, heated bed, tool-less setup, liquid cooling for jam free prints, all-metal 450C hot ends, automatic print layer cooling fan, wireless full color touch screen, wi-fi printing and video updates, and a full metal frame, stainless steel gears, and a 12X12X12 inch build volume. Below you can see a full list of the features.  We will expand on these in our upcoming updates:   RoVa4D Technical Specs: Thank you to all of the media outlets for sharing about us! Backer Awesomeness:  Meet the ORD Team:We have an amazing team!  Each person had their own role in getting this Kickstarter/Pre-order ready!  Way to go team!!  Special Thanks:We also want to thank Eric Wenger of Express Manufacturing for his hard work collaborating with Chris on designing the new color mixer head, Mike Odendahl of Movinpics Videography for the awesome main video, Jay from Milkman Media for the sweet Animation and Icon Graphics, and Shakil at Electro Plating for rushing to meet our deadlines - we couldn't have done this campaign without you!",26.0,5,"1 Campaign

Draft on Traveler and with seamless syncing to the cloud, effortlessly transition to editing later on your computer.

<p>We brought you the first modern distraction-free writing tool, the Freewrite smart typewriter, and now we are back with a new device that builds on all the feedback we have received over the past 4 years. Traveler includes all the distraction-free features of the Freewrite but is half the size, half the weight, and for a limited time, available at a significantly discounted price.</p>

<p>Astrohaus is a product design company focused on creating high quality productivity tools. It was founded in 2014 when we launched our first product, the Freewrite smart typewriter, on Kickstarter. The project was a huge success, <strong>raising ~$342k</strong>, and ushering in a new era of distraction-free writing. Since then, thousands more Freewrites have shipped to writers in <strong>50+ countries</strong>. Our mission is to invent unique, well-designed consumer products that make people's lives more productive and fulfilling. They must be timely and ideally, timeless. A guiding design principle is that function comes first. We pressure ourselves to think holistically about the user experience, often melding old with new. Our customers love the Freewrite; over <strong>45 million words</strong> have been typed on devices globally. With Traveler, we're excited to grow the Freewrite family with the ultimate, portable writing tool. Astrohaus is a small team of dedicated craftspeople with offices in New York City and Detroit.</p>

As social media and entertainment companies spend billions in the war for our attention, we must fight back.
 

 
Traveler removes the ability to get distracted. There isn’t a web browser, email client, or even any notifications which means all that energy required to resist temptation is now freed for a more useful purpose, your writing. The effect is real, and it works.


Studies have shown it takes 25 minutes on average to refocus on the original task after a single interruption. Without distractions, Traveler helps the writer get into a flow state and stay there.
 


When you’re in the flow, nothing can stop you. Traveler puts all your attention on the written word. There are no settings to play with or fonts to pick, you can do all that stuff later at your computer. Traveler was designed to be part of a draft first, edit later, writing philosophy. 

The idea is that by separating the creative and the critical, we can work more effectively. Draft on Traveler and with seamless syncing to the cloud, effortlessly transition to editing later on your computer. Once there you can still use your favorite editing programs like Scrivener, Final Draft, or Word.
 


At half the size of a conventional laptop, Traveler’s compact size and weight make it your perfect everyday companion. Write whenever and wherever inspiration strikes.
 

 
 
We brought you the first modern distraction-free writing tool, the Freewrite smart typewriter, and now we are back with a new device that builds on all the feedback we have received over the past 4 years. Traveler includes all the distraction-free features of the Freewrite but is half the size, half the weight, and for a limited time, available at a significantly discounted price.
We've heard from customers over and over that writing without distractions has massively improved their productivity, in some cases as much as doubling their hourly word count.
 


 

 

 


Traveler is the world’s first laptop to use an e-paper display which means you won’t have to stare at the backlight of another computer screen. E Ink™ uses ambient light which makes it is easy on the eyes and won’t wash out even in direct sunlight.  
 

 

 


The Traveler’s keyboard goes back in time to when laptops were designed for feel and not exclusively for slimness. Each key has nearly 2mm of travel and has just the right amount of resistance to make your fingers happy.  
 

 

 

 

Use the [special] key to show information about your writing session. Write until you reach a word count or time goal.    
 

 

Traveler supports Markdown syntax automatically allowing for rich formatting in your writing like headings, bullet points, and italics. Use it and you’ll receive a fully formatted Word (.docx) or Final Draft (.fdx) file synced to the cloud. 
 

Drafts are constantly saved to internal flash storage and, once connected to a Wi-Fi network, automatically synced to your favorite cloud services with secure 256-bit encryption. Work offline or online with ease. Traveler currently supports syncing to Dropbox, Evernote, and Google Drive.
   
 

Need QWERTZ, AZERTY, or another keyboard layout? We’ve got you covered. Traveler will ship with support for 30+ keyboard layouts configurable in software. Note, all keyboards will be printed with QWERTY on the keycaps. 

The Traveler supports: English, English Intl, Colemak (EN), Dvorak (EN), Arabic, Bulgarian, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, French (Belgium), French (Canada), French (Swiss), German, German (Neo), Greek (Modern), Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish
 
 

No matter what you're working on, Traveler's design will help you finish that draft.
 

 
 

 

 
 
 

 

Protect your portable writing tool from nicks and bangs inside your bag with the Traveler Felt Sleeve! Designed specifically to fit the unique shape of the Traveler. 

 

All Indemand, pre-ordered, Traveler-related perks have an estimated shipping date of August 2019. 
Note: If you pre-ordered during our campaign, your estimated delivery date is Fall 2019. If you selected the Traveler + Freewrite Bundle, the Freewrite will ship in Summer, ahead of Traveler in Fall.

Astrohaus is a product design company focused on creating high quality productivity tools. It was founded in 2014 when we launched our first product, the Freewrite smart typewriter, on Kickstarter. The project was a huge success, raising ~$342k, and ushering in a new era of distraction-free writing. Since then, thousands more Freewrites have shipped to writers in 50+ countries. Our mission is to invent unique, well-designed consumer products that make people's lives more productive and fulfilling. They must be timely and ideally, timeless. A guiding design principle is that function comes first. We pressure ourselves to think holistically about the user experience, often melding old with new. Our customers love the Freewrite; over 45 million words have been typed on devices globally. With Traveler, we're excited to grow the Freewrite family with the ultimate, portable writing tool. Astrohaus is a small team of dedicated craftspeople with offices in New York City and Detroit.

THE STORY BEHIND

In this modern time, some of us often forget how much time, effort, affection, and passion given through the ages to create a state of art done traditionally. This is what drives us to restore those values through the beauty process of hand weaving.

The fabrics manufactured in Central Java region, Indonesia by local craftsmen using only local grown cotton and natural coloring pigments since our objective is to lessen industrial pollution on our planet.
The fact that hand weaving can only be done if conducted steady and slowly, makes it special and personal. This drives us to deliver and tell the world about legacy that shapes our identity today through a notebook.


Sequence of experiments and prototyping conducted to get the desired forms and features of the notebook. We designed the notebook to be modest and simple, expressing the sincerity and humble development of weavings to your notebook.
The beauty and elegance of a fabric
The fabric does tell you a long beautiful story, it represent the slow made process and the work grown from a local culture with long sequence of history.

The Modest Design of the notebook
Our notebook form is designed to be modest and simple with multiple of substantial features. The feature will come handy as a great tool for creators and thinkers.

Our Selection of Paper ​
With our current campaign goal, we are able to provide you two selections of paper, plain and ruled. We are using 100 gsm fine grain, made in Italy. Comfortable, thick and durable for your daily needs.




The commitment to prevent harm to the planet moves us to only use the paper that has the FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certificates, acid free, ISO certification and chlorine free. We do not want our paper to be only organic, and sustainable, but also to be responsible to our society and environment.

These layers are stored in the .gizmo file, mentioned above, which is then used in GiziPrint to print the object.</p><p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Next, a layer is projected onto a bath of UV curable resin using HD DLP projectors, curing the resin and building the object layer by layer. As each layer is completed, the build plate lowers incrementally from the top of the resin surface into the vat. The light from the projectors hardens these layers sequentially, and then stacks them on top of each other to form the 3D object.</p><p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Gizmo 3D’s unique technology suspends the object inside the liquid-filled vat as it is created, minimising the stress that is placed on the model during creation. This means less supports are required and a finer level of detail can be achieved.

<br/><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">10 reasons why you need to be first in line to get this innovative 3D printer in your life:</span></h3>
<b><br/></b><p><b>1. Reliability</b></p>
<p>We don’t believe in dressing our machines up in fancy clothes. Instead, the Gizmo 3D printer is proud to show you what it's made of - quality parts that scream reliability!</p>
<p>One of the main reasons people get frustrated with other 3D printers is that they are constantly having to replace low quality parts. You won’t find this with the Gizmo 3D; our machines are built to last, and it shows.<br/><br/></p>
<p><b>2. The ground-breaking super speed add-on (prints up to 3mm per minute/7 inches per hour)</b></p>
<p>Our world famous super speed add-on (patent pending) fits on all 3 of our machines and allows you to print more than one item at a time at super speed. Unlike 3D printers with extruders that print only a section of a layer of the object at a time, our technology enables you to print the whole layer at once, giving you great results in record time. In addition, the add-on allows you to print numerous objects in the time it takes for other printers to process one.</p>
<p>Conditions apply: Continuous printing comes with certain limitations. It does not handle flat surfaces which are parallel to the build plate, and needs a certain wall thickness to print perfectly. This can be solved using standard printing.<br/><br/></p>

<p>Users can look forward to printing high resolution results that wow even the most discerning of tastes. What’s more, these results are achievable using our standard machines and do not require the super speed add-on.</p>
<p>At CES 2016, we put our results to the test, handing out magnifying glasses to visitors and asking them to examine our 3D prints. These impartial observers were more than impressed, and we were the only company to do this.</p>
<p>The XY resolution of our machines is between 36 and 200 micron, while the calculated Z resolution is 0.07 micron. We have experimented successfully with different lenses, boosting this resolution even more for very small and detailed prints, and can now print with an XY resolution of 20 micron, using the add-on.<br/><br/></p>

<p><b><br/>4. Competitive pricing</b></p>
<p>Our standard Gizmo 3D machine (without the super speed add-on) is available to buy on IndieGoGo from only $2950 throughout March. By jumping the queue and becoming one of our first 30 backers, you will save a further $200; the best deal you will ever find on this incredible printer.</p>
<p>The super speed add-on is available for purchase anytime at only $2600, representing our commitment to delivering the best add-ons at the most reasonable prices.<br/><br/></p>
<p><b>5. Different materials to suit your projects and budget</b></p>
<p>Our machines are compatible with <a href=""http://funtodo.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fun To Do Resin</a>, which is affordable and widely available in many countries. Included in the prices of our machines is enough Fun To Do resin for you to dive straight in and start printing right away. We are currently testing more brands of resin so that we may be able to recommend resin types to you to suit your individual needs. <br/><br/>These include resin from <a href=""http://pro3dure.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">pro3dcure</a>, <a href=""http://www.monocure3d.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Monocure</a> and Vitang.<br/><br/></p>
<p><b>6. Consistent Results, Remote Repeatability</b></p>
<p>Every time you run a print job, the software will create a .gizmo file containing all the configuration details needed to repeat the same job, with the same results, time and time again, on any Gizmo printer.<br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456810503/pyq45v2hekyo1tnk9ukg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/>Need consistent results remotely? No problem! Simply send the .gizmo file to another Gizmo 3D printer, anywhere in the world, and sit back and relax, safe in the knowledge that it will print exactly the same on the other side. The receiver won’t have to slice the object again, or add any supports – they will just need to hit ‘print’. Think of the Gizmo 3D Printer as your personal teleportation device, bringing you the future, today.<br/><br/></p>
<p><b>7. Innovative software features</b></p>
<p>Our 3D Printer Software, Gizmetor, includes features never before seen anywhere in the 3D printing world, including full layer manipulation, which is the ability to select a particular layer within a print job, and specify how you would like it printed (i.e. hollow, solid, detailed or faster). The machines are highly configurable, allowing you to easily switch between ultra-detailed high res prints and super speed prints with ease.<br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456811112/ssiz5znqircknuc3bfmp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>Coming soon: A full list of the software features that you can look forward to.<br/><br/><p><b>8. Expandable</b></p>
<p>Each machine is built in such a way that it grows with the user and their needs. If your situation changes and you find you need a bigger vat, this is not a problem; you can simply purchase the add-on. With other 3D printers, such an upgrade would require the purchase of a whole new machine.</p>
<p><b><br/>9. Made for users, by users</b></p>
<p>We’re all about the user, and do everything we can to deliver you the best experience possible. This is because we are just like you; we love 3D printing!</p>
<p>However, we also aim to provide users with as much flexibility, capability and functionality as possible, giving you the ability to configure the printer in any way you see fit. While this is surely enough to raise the pulses of experienced users or those with some mid-level 3D printing know-how, it could leave absolute beginners feeling a little overwhelmed. Don’t be disheartened; enjoy the experience, progress along the learning curve, and invest some time and effort in developing your skills... believe us, it’s worth it!</p>

<br/><p><b>10. Top Down System = Guaranteed Reduction in Downtime and Costs</b></p>
<p>Our top down system means that the vat doesn’t need to be emptied between prints because the unwanted hardened chunks of resin sink to the bottom. This means users can start printing as soon as the previous print is complete, saving even more time in between already super fast prints. Have you experienced all the hassle and inconvenience of a bottom up printer? Not even an issue with the Gizmo 3D.</p>
<p>The Advantages of a <b>Top Down</b> System</p>
<ul>
<li>The build plate doesn’t need to be removed from the printer to remove the printed object. Users simply need to scrape the finished print off the plate and start printing again immediately.</li>
<li>When the print job is done, the printed object sits on top of the build plate, rather than hanging off the bottom.  This means less supports are needed than with bottom up printers, which reduces resin wastage and cleaning time.</li>
<li>Users can pause the printing process and add metal bits such as screws and bolts to their 3D object if they like. We don’t believe it can be done easily with bottom up machines.</li>
<li>Users will experience less downtime because they can calibrate far more easily than they would be able to with bottom up DLP printers.</li>
<li>Bottom up printers normally need a silicone layer which must be replaced regularly. With Gizmo 3D Printers, no replacement parts are required during the printing process because we print directly onto the resin.</li>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458684949/r3l3dvqruamxj4cdzoqd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Vastly improved user experience</span></h3>We want to provide a breath of fresh air in the market and give the long-suffering members of the 3D printing community the experience they deserve. Why? Because we too know how it feels to wake up, run downstairs and find a failed print waiting for us!<br/><br/><p>We are Kobus and Michelle du Toit; a husband and wife team and the proud owners of this tiny but potent Australian startup. Gizmo 3D Printers exists because of low quality 3D printers and the frustrations they cause. Kobus experienced these frustrations himself until one day he decided ‘no more’, and set out to build a 3D printer that offered the best experience possible to users. Together, our dream is to overhaul the 3D printing market, putting users first and giving them an outstanding experience at a competitive price.<br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456808752/ukiutld7spgaiqw1axcp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<span style=""font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">The technical details that us Geeks love:</span><p>All of our printers can print either at a <b>standard speed</b> (also known as <b>sequential printing</b>) or <b>continuously</b>. Sequential printing is used for highly detailed prints, such as jewellery and other more intricate projects.</p>
<p>When printing continuously without our super speed add-on, Gizmo 3D printers can achieve speeds of between 0.5mm to 1mm per minute, depending on the size of the projection area. The bigger the area, the slower the printing time. Users will be able to print continuously from 70mm x 39mm at 1mm per minute to 160mm x 90mm at 0.5mm per minute on any of our machines.</p>
<p>Please note: Continuous printing does have its limitations. The top left corner is the weakest spot in the projection area, so the bigger the area, the less power the machine will be able to wield. This may mean that you will not be able to use some areas of the build plate when printing continuously.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you will need to set a hollow value of between 0.1 and 0.3, using the software. If you require extra strength within the printed object, you can add a honeycomb structure. This will give you a wall thickness of between 0.5mm and 1mm, providing additional strength and structural integrity.</p>
<p>Slower printing provides you with thicker walls, adding further strength to the object. To give you an idea of what you can expect, we are currently printing a skull hollow at 0.5mm per minute, with walls that are just over 1.7mm thick.</p>
<p>Need to print surfaces parallel to the build plate? Simply print the object an angle, or switch over to standard printing mode.</p>
<p>You can configure the software to swap between continuous and standard printing modes quickly and easily between layers when printing an object. Switching between modes in this way will not affect the quality of the print job, as evidenced by the picture of The Eiffel Tower model, below, which was printed with 85 overrides and included 6 to 8 periods of continuous printing.<br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456809192/ngvvkqhbufgfxyujpfmv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</h4>
<br/><p>Slower printing might be best for more detailed projects, but you can still get great results in an ultra-quick time with our super speed add-on (US $2600). With this add-on, an area of 110mm x 62mm can be printed at 3mm per minute, with results that are unmatched by our competitors in the market. Of course, as you increase the size of your projection area, the speed of your print job decreases. When printing continuously, your projection width can be a maximum of 325mm and you can print at a speed of 0.5mm per minute.</p>
<p>The super speed add-on is a second projector, with rails, brackets and electronics which combine images perfectly. It also includes a remote handset to control the electronics, an IR extender, multiple power cables for both projectors, multiple HDMI cables, and multiple adapters to plug all the cables into the electronics. The add-on is highly effective, reducing the display time needed to produce sequential prints by up to half. (Please note, this is half the display time, not half the total print time).</p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">What we need &amp; what you will receive</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We need your help in making Gizmo even more amazing and in bringing this incredible machine to market. We ask you to contribute whatever you can to our Indiegogo funding campaign, as we aim to raise the $95,000 we need to take Gizmo 3D to the next level. The more we raise; the farther we can push the Gizmo 3D envelope!</p>
<p>We will use the funding we receive to enhance the unique and cutting edge capabilities of Gizmo, as well as developing the Gizmo Share Library. Through this library, Gizmo 3D Printer users will be able to share object files, tutorials and user experiences, as well as rating our equipment and even donating towards other projects.<br/><br/>We also aim to develop our resources and streamline our manufacturing process, allowing us to dramatically improve our time-to-delivery (currently 4-6 months per customer order). In addition to this, we will enter into partnerships with resin manufacturers in an effort to create a variety of materials (i.e transparent, flexible and different coloured materials) for the Gizmo machine. With these materials – and the support that we will be able to offer – the potential for our customers’ projects is limitless. <br/><br/>We’ve come this far, but, with your help, we can go so much further. What we have created up to now is really only a fraction of what is possible. Go ahead and become part of something truly amazing!<br/><br/></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The impact</span></h3>
<p>This technology is the magic ingredient required to advance 
manufacturing in a multitude of different and diverse industries. 
However, being a start-up, we don’t have the funding required to get the
 word out there! Every day that goes past is another day that a company 
could have benefited from this tech, yet they simply were not aware of 
it. Instead, they are losing time and money that we could be saving for 
them!
</p>
<p>Industries that could be benefitting from this technology today 
include medicine, dentistry, aviation, military, creative, fashion and 
education, to name just a few. The time and money that they can save 
using this technology can be better spent on finding cures, funding 
studies, educating young minds and developing other technologies which 
benefit us all in the long run. </p>
<p><i>“My wife and I run a business teaching technology to children. We use the 3D printer when we’re teaching children 3D design. We help them print out 3D prints of their objects. When you are teaching children, they don’t have a lot of patience for 3 hour print jobs so the super speed is a very nice feature for us.”</i><br/><b>-  Kent Kuhler, Entrepreneur/Engineer, Desert Community Robotics.</b><br/><br/><i>“As I use very thin-walled (20 mils) egg-shells for casting ear plugs, your super speed 3D-printers would work perfect. My vision is to also offer instant manufacturing of the ear plugs similar to all these express photo shops in the past: ""Get your photos within an hour!""</i><br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>- Tony Levander, CEO/Owner, ILICON AB</b></span></p>
<p><i>“I can see it being really good to use among students like me in Universities because it’s so reliable and tough. I look forward to using it for prototyping of my university projects.”- Jacob Murray, QUT Student“ As a Research Assistant at McMaster University, managing the 3D printing technology of our lab is one of my primary responsibilities. The ratio of ""amount of different printers we have"" vs. ""printer innovation"" is pretty poor. Every printer on the market seems like a ""Version 2.0"" of the printer before it.  Half the purpose of our lab is to teach about machines, and the other half is to pump out quality and consistent prints. If every printer we have works almost exactly the same as the one beside it; slow, inconsistent, limited in design, or completely closed box, I've often wondered why we bother with so many different ""run of the mill"" printers.</i></p>
<p><i>That's why I'm so excited about the Gizmo 3D.Finally a printer that breaks the mould and doesn't copy it's competition!The whole purpose of 3D printing is re-invention and innovation.”<br/></i><b>- James Hutton, Research Assistant, McMaster University<br/><br/></b></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Testimonials</span></h3>
<p>This technology is so advanced that there are people who find it hard to believe that it exists. We don’t expect you to just take our word for it, so here’s some testimonials from our beta testers, and more people who have seen these machines in action themselves:<br/><br/><b>Beta testers: (In addition to the videos at the top of the campaign)</b></p>
<i>“The Gizmo 3D sets itself apart in a few areas.  It’s much faster than the regular FDM machines whilst not compromising on the output quality.  Its robust parts means that it is very reliable in terms of its printing with repeatable results.  This in itself, allows you to fine tune very quickly – you can adjust for very quick printing for prototyping or slow down and attain a quality finish similar to mass manufactured parts.  In some prints, it rivals our polyjet machine whilst being more reliable.  It’s a lot simpler to operate compared to other laser SLS machines – the top down action means that there’s no complicated peeling required and you don’t have to worry about uncured debris blocking the print.  Just stir and print. “</i><br/><b>- Kin Ly FBE FabLab, University of New South Wales </b><br/><br/><b>CES 2016 attendees:</b><br/>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/>Our vision and mission</span></h3>
<p><b>Vision Statement:<br/></b>To keep on delivering an innovative, top-quality product that the 3D printing community can believe in, while keeping our pricing competitive and giving our customers the printing experience they deserve.<br/><br/><b>Mission Statement:</b><br/>Our mission is to connect the global 3D printing community with innovative, high-quality 3D printers and accessories, allowing them to pursue their passion at a price they can afford.<br/><br/>We strive to make 3D printing fast, fun and efficient for our users, and the starting point is what we hope to be a successful Indiegogo campaign. With this funding, we will have the opportunity to grow our organisation and to reach our full potential.<br/><br/></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Risks and Challenges</span></h3>
<p><b>Continuing to reduce production issues</b><br/>We have already completed a small production run of 4 beta machines and a pre-production run of 15 printers, so we know that we can deliver. Our suppliers are already in place, we have our shipment channels, our TNT accounts and DHL accounts all set up and already in operation. We have already sent printers to locations all over the globe, including France, Vietnam, Taiwan, multiple USA cities, Canada and Australia.</p>
<p>The initial teething troubles and issues we experienced were all dealt with accordingly, and the experience we gained during those production runs prepared us well for the upcoming Indiegogo production run. With all this in place, we are certain that we won’t let our backers down.<br/><br/></p>
<p><b>Delayed shipping &amp; damaged goods<br/></b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Currently, shipping times are between 4 and 6 months. The printers will be shipped from Vietnam in wooden crates, which have been specifically designed to prevent damage in transit. Easing the learning curve for backersThis is cutting edge technology, and as such, there will always be something of a learning curve for users to get to grips with.</span></p>
<p>We have a panel of reputable beta testers, who have provided us with <span>feedback regarding this. We will make this information available to the public via tutorials, a quick-start guide and a more detailed handbook, as well as using their feedback to further hone our products and enhance the experience for the end user.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Building our inventory</b><br/>We are actively looking for debt funding that will allow us to build more 3D printers that can be ordered from our website immediately after the campaign is completed.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Jealousy</b><br/>Users of our machines may be subjected to jealousy in the workplace. This is natural. Our advice in dealing with this is as follows; give away 3D prints as gifts and peace offerings. You will be printing them so fast and so cheaply anyway, using our affordable resin.<br/><br/></span></p>

<br/><br/><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Other ways you can help</span></h3>
<b>Spread the word!<br/></b><span>Every day that passes by is a huge loss to many industries and organisations that could be benefitting from this technology. You can help to put this right by spreading the word about this breakthrough technology. <br/><br/>Don’t let the world miss out any longer; use word of mouth, social media, blog platforms and whatever you can to get the word out there. Every effort helps and is very much appreciated!<br/></span><br/><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">FAQ</span></h3>
<p><b>Have a question?</b> If the info below doesn't answer your question, you can ask the project creator directly or email <b>info@gizmo3Dprinters.com.au</b>.<br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">____________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p><b>What color is the included resin?</b><br/>It is the red that you see being used in most of our 3D print photos.<br/><br/><b>Can you tell me the technical differences between the GiziMate 130 and the GiziPro 130?</b><br/></p>
<p>The GiziPro can be upgraded by the user to add a vat that will allow prints that are 390mm tall where the tallest vat that can be installed in the GiziMate is a 260mm tall vat.</p>
<p>The GiziPro is taller so you can move the projector assembly further away from the vat .  This means you don't need to lower the wide vat that much to get to the 400mm wide projection area.  With the GiziMate you need to lower the wide vat to the bottom to achieve the 400mm wide projection area.  This means the GiziPro can print taller objects when using the wide vat compared to the GiziMate.</p>
<br/><b>Why do the GiziMate 130 Basic, GiziPro 130 Basic and GiziMax 130 Basic all come with the same build volume? I don't see what the advantage is of purchasing the more expensive ones. It seems the Pro and Max should come with a larger build plate as standard.</b><br/>It is because our machines grows with the user, so when you purchase a machine, it comes with the standard sized vat and build plate and when you want to scale to make bigger prints, you can just buy the larger vat and build plate that you need. The advantage is - if you have the bigger machine already, you can upgrade to the bigger vat and build plate anytime when you have the money to do so.<br/><br/><b>Why is the GiziMate 390 Basic the only one where the Indiegogo price is the same as the MSRP ($4100)? All the others have a special Indiegogo launch price, why not this one?</b><br/>It does  have a special Indiegogo launch price, you just picked up a mistake we made with the MSRP price - it should have been listed as MSRP $4550. Because someone has already backed it, that figure cant be changed in the perks. The price of the printer is correct though.<br/><br/><p><b>Why is shipping not included in the price?</b><br/>Global shipping prices vary. It is much cheaper for the user to handle this on a country-by-country basis.<br/><br/><b>How much is the international shipping cost?</b><br/>The price of shipping varies depending on what country you live in. Unfortunately, international shipping is far from simple; different countries levy different taxes and charges against shipping. Because of this, we ask that the buyer assumes responsibility for such charges when ordering a Gizmo 3D printer.</p>
<p><b>When will my Gizmo 3D Printer arrive?</b><br/>Your printer will arrive between 4 and 6 months after the Indiegogo campaign ends on 31 March 2016 (unless otherwise specified in the perks section).<br/><br/><b>Can I use third party resins with the Gizmo 3D Printer?</b><br/>In theory, any DLP compatible resin will work. However, we can only guarantee that resins we have personally tested will work with our machines. <br/><br/><b>Can you print a sample of my own file?</b><br/>At this time we are very busy on getting the Gizmo 3D Printer out the door so we are currently unable to provide individual samples.  We are working on this and will post updates via the Indiegogo page when we are able to offer this service. <br/></p>
<p><b>Will Gizmo 3D Printers offer a warranty or support?<br/></b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">At the moment we are unable to provide specific details in terms of warranty and support, but we are in the process of developing this. However, we can guarantee that the printer you will receive will be in full working order, and we can tell you that we are planning to take extra special care of the supporters who have been with us from the beginning.</span></p>
<p><b>Do you have plans for making a bigger printer?<br/></b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">This is part of our long term aim, although nothing concrete has been designed as yet.</span></p>
<p><b>What comes with my Gizmo 3D Printer?<br/></b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The Gizmo 3D Printer comes with enough resin to get you started and a hand pump to use when pumping out resin from your vat when you want to switch resins. </span></p>

How does it work?
To get your print job underway, first import an .stl or .obj file to our Gizmetor software. Gizmetor then slices the 3D object into horizontal 2D images called layers. These layers are stored in the .gizmo file, mentioned above, which is then used in GiziPrint to print the object.Next, a layer is projected onto a bath of UV curable resin using HD DLP projectors, curing the resin and building the object layer by layer. As each layer is completed, the build plate lowers incrementally from the top of the resin surface into the vat. The light from the projectors hardens these layers sequentially, and then stacks them on top of each other to form the 3D object.Gizmo 3D’s unique technology suspends the object inside the liquid-filled vat as it is created, minimising the stress that is placed on the model during creation. This means less supports are required and a finer level of detail can be achieved. At the end of the print comes the big reveal, as the build plate lifts the object slowly out of the resin.Castle by boldmachinesStretch goalsWow, all 3 of the stretch goals have already been unlocked and all backers of 3D printers will benefit as follows:Which 3D printer is for you?The Gizmo 3D Printers come in 3 different sizes to suit your needs:Ours is a desktop 3D printer.

Please email info@gizmo3Dprinters.com.au for a personal Gizmo 3D Printer recommendation tailored to your individual needs.

10 reasons why you need to be first in line to get this innovative 3D printer in your life:
1. Reliability
We don’t believe in dressing our machines up in fancy clothes. Instead, the Gizmo 3D printer is proud to show you what it's made of - quality parts that scream reliability!
One of the main reasons people get frustrated with other 3D printers is that they are constantly having to replace low quality parts. You won’t find this with the Gizmo 3D; our machines are built to last, and it shows.
2. The ground-breaking super speed add-on (prints up to 3mm per minute/7 inches per hour)
Our world famous super speed add-on (patent pending) fits on all 3 of our machines and allows you to print more than one item at a time at super speed. Unlike 3D printers with extruders that print only a section of a layer of the object at a time, our technology enables you to print the whole layer at once, giving you great results in record time. In addition, the add-on allows you to print numerous objects in the time it takes for other printers to process one.
Conditions apply: Continuous printing comes with certain limitations. It does not handle flat surfaces which are parallel to the build plate, and needs a certain wall thickness to print perfectly. This can be solved using standard printing.

Users can look forward to printing high resolution results that wow even the most discerning of tastes. What’s more, these results are achievable using our standard machines and do not require the super speed add-on.
At CES 2016, we put our results to the test, handing out magnifying glasses to visitors and asking them to examine our 3D prints. These impartial observers were more than impressed, and we were the only company to do this.
The XY resolution of our machines is between 36 and 200 micron, while the calculated Z resolution is 0.07 micron. We have experimented successfully with different lenses, boosting this resolution even more for very small and detailed prints, and can now print with an XY resolution of 20 micron, using the add-on.

4. Competitive pricing
Our standard Gizmo 3D machine (without the super speed add-on) is available to buy on IndieGoGo from only $2950 throughout March. By jumping the queue and becoming one of our first 30 backers, you will save a further $200; the best deal you will ever find on this incredible printer.
The super speed add-on is available for purchase anytime at only $2600, representing our commitment to delivering the best add-ons at the most reasonable prices.
5. Different materials to suit your projects and budget
Our machines are compatible with Fun To Do Resin, which is affordable and widely available in many countries. Included in the prices of our machines is enough Fun To Do resin for you to dive straight in and start printing right away. We are currently testing more brands of resin so that we may be able to recommend resin types to you to suit your individual needs. These include resin from pro3dcure, Monocure and Vitang.
6. Consistent Results, Remote Repeatability
Every time you run a print job, the software will create a .gizmo file containing all the configuration details needed to repeat the same job, with the same results, time and time again, on any Gizmo printer.

Need consistent results remotely? No problem! Simply send the .gizmo file to another Gizmo 3D printer, anywhere in the world, and sit back and relax, safe in the knowledge that it will print exactly the same on the other side. The receiver won’t have to slice the object again, or add any supports – they will just need to hit ‘print’. Think of the Gizmo 3D Printer as your personal teleportation device, bringing you the future, today.
7. Innovative software features
Our 3D Printer Software, Gizmetor, includes features never before seen anywhere in the 3D printing world, including full layer manipulation, which is the ability to select a particular layer within a print job, and specify how you would like it printed (i.e. hollow, solid, detailed or faster). The machines are highly configurable, allowing you to easily switch between ultra-detailed high res prints and super speed prints with ease.

Coming soon: A full list of the software features that you can look forward to.8. Expandable
Each machine is built in such a way that it grows with the user and their needs. If your situation changes and you find you need a bigger vat, this is not a problem; you can simply purchase the add-on. With other 3D printers, such an upgrade would require the purchase of a whole new machine.
9. Made for users, by users
We’re all about the user, and do everything we can to deliver you the best experience possible. This is because we are just like you; we love 3D printing!
However, we also aim to provide users with as much flexibility, capability and functionality as possible, giving you the ability to configure the printer in any way you see fit. While this is surely enough to raise the pulses of experienced users or those with some mid-level 3D printing know-how, it could leave absolute beginners feeling a little overwhelmed. Don’t be disheartened; enjoy the experience, progress along the learning curve, and invest some time and effort in developing your skills... believe us, it’s worth it!




10. Top Down System = Guaranteed Reduction in Downtime and Costs
Our top down system means that the vat doesn’t need to be emptied between prints because the unwanted hardened chunks of resin sink to the bottom. This means users can start printing as soon as the previous print is complete, saving even more time in between already super fast prints. Have you experienced all the hassle and inconvenience of a bottom up printer? Not even an issue with the Gizmo 3D.
The Advantages of a Top Down System

The build plate doesn’t need to be removed from the printer to remove the printed object. Users simply need to scrape the finished print off the plate and start printing again immediately.
When the print job is done, the printed object sits on top of the build plate, rather than hanging off the bottom.  This means less supports are needed than with bottom up printers, which reduces resin wastage and cleaning time.
Users can pause the printing process and add metal bits such as screws and bolts to their 3D object if they like. We don’t believe it can be done easily with bottom up machines.
Users will experience less downtime because they can calibrate far more easily than they would be able to with bottom up DLP printers.
Bottom up printers normally need a silicone layer which must be replaced regularly. With Gizmo 3D Printers, no replacement parts are required during the printing process because we print directly onto the resin.
If that’s not enough reasons to get you jumping for joy,  click here to check out our 101 (good!) reasons to get hold of a Gizmo 3D printer! 
Patent pending

The patent pending covers the way we do super speed printing.  We use multiple image sources to produce a single image.  The image sources are aligned using mechanical and digital means.  The patent pending also covers stitching multiple images sources together using mechanical and digital means to form a bigger printing area.Stretch goals
We are so happy to be at the stage where we can finally reveal our stretch goals (all thanks to our wonderful backers). 

Vastly improved user experienceWe want to provide a breath of fresh air in the market and give the long-suffering members of the 3D printing community the experience they deserve. Why? Because we too know how it feels to wake up, run downstairs and find a failed print waiting for us!We are Kobus and Michelle du Toit; a husband and wife team and the proud owners of this tiny but potent Australian startup. Gizmo 3D Printers exists because of low quality 3D printers and the frustrations they cause. Kobus experienced these frustrations himself until one day he decided ‘no more’, and set out to build a 3D printer that offered the best experience possible to users. Together, our dream is to overhaul the 3D printing market, putting users first and giving them an outstanding experience at a competitive price.


The technical details that us Geeks love:All of our printers can print either at a standard speed (also known as sequential printing) or continuously. Sequential printing is used for highly detailed prints, such as jewellery and other more intricate projects.
When printing continuously without our super speed add-on, Gizmo 3D printers can achieve speeds of between 0.5mm to 1mm per minute, depending on the size of the projection area. The bigger the area, the slower the printing time. Users will be able to print continuously from 70mm x 39mm at 1mm per minute to 160mm x 90mm at 0.5mm per minute on any of our machines.
Please note: Continuous printing does have its limitations. The top left corner is the weakest spot in the projection area, so the bigger the area, the less power the machine will be able to wield. This may mean that you will not be able to use some areas of the build plate when printing continuously.
Most of the time, you will need to set a hollow value of between 0.1 and 0.3, using the software. If you require extra strength within the printed object, you can add a honeycomb structure. This will give you a wall thickness of between 0.5mm and 1mm, providing additional strength and structural integrity.
Slower printing provides you with thicker walls, adding further strength to the object. To give you an idea of what you can expect, we are currently printing a skull hollow at 0.5mm per minute, with walls that are just over 1.7mm thick.
Need to print surfaces parallel to the build plate? Simply print the object an angle, or switch over to standard printing mode.
You can configure the software to swap between continuous and standard printing modes quickly and easily between layers when printing an object. Switching between modes in this way will not affect the quality of the print job, as evidenced by the picture of The Eiffel Tower model, below, which was printed with 85 overrides and included 6 to 8 periods of continuous printing.

Slower printing might be best for more detailed projects, but you can still get great results in an ultra-quick time with our super speed add-on (US $2600). With this add-on, an area of 110mm x 62mm can be printed at 3mm per minute, with results that are unmatched by our competitors in the market. Of course, as you increase the size of your projection area, the speed of your print job decreases. When printing continuously, your projection width can be a maximum of 325mm and you can print at a speed of 0.5mm per minute.
The super speed add-on is a second projector, with rails, brackets and electronics which combine images perfectly. It also includes a remote handset to control the electronics, an IR extender, multiple power cables for both projectors, multiple HDMI cables, and multiple adapters to plug all the cables into the electronics. The add-on is highly effective, reducing the display time needed to produce sequential prints by up to half. (Please note, this is half the display time, not half the total print time).

How do Gizmo 3D Printers compare to other 3D printers?
The Gizmo 3D Printer is unique. Ours is the only top down resin-based 3D printer of its kind, giving you a raft of advantages over other 3D printing methods available on the market. Take a look at our handy table outlining some general dimensions and stats to compare:



What we need & what you will receive


We need your help in making Gizmo even more amazing and in bringing this incredible machine to market. We ask you to contribute whatever you can to our Indiegogo funding campaign, as we aim to raise the $95,000 we need to take Gizmo 3D to the next level. The more we raise; the farther we can push the Gizmo 3D envelope!
We will use the funding we receive to enhance the unique and cutting edge capabilities of Gizmo, as well as developing the Gizmo Share Library. Through this library, Gizmo 3D Printer users will be able to share object files, tutorials and user experiences, as well as rating our equipment and even donating towards other projects.We also aim to develop our resources and streamline our manufacturing process, allowing us to dramatically improve our time-to-delivery (currently 4-6 months per customer order). In addition to this, we will enter into partnerships with resin manufacturers in an effort to create a variety of materials (i.e transparent, flexible and different coloured materials) for the Gizmo machine. With these materials – and the support that we will be able to offer – the potential for our customers’ projects is limitless. We’ve come this far, but, with your help, we can go so much further. What we have created up to now is really only a fraction of what is possible. Go ahead and become part of something truly amazing!
The impact
This technology is the magic ingredient required to advance 
manufacturing in a multitude of different and diverse industries. 
However, being a start-up, we don’t have the funding required to get the
 word out there! Every day that goes past is another day that a company 
could have benefited from this tech, yet they simply were not aware of 
it. Instead, they are losing time and money that we could be saving for 
them!

Industries that could be benefitting from this technology today 
include medicine, dentistry, aviation, military, creative, fashion and 
education, to name just a few. The time and money that they can save 
using this technology can be better spent on finding cures, funding 
studies, educating young minds and developing other technologies which 
benefit us all in the long run. 
“My wife and I run a business teaching technology to children. We use the 3D printer when we’re teaching children 3D design. We help them print out 3D prints of their objects. When you are teaching children, they don’t have a lot of patience for 3 hour print jobs so the super speed is a very nice feature for us.”-  Kent Kuhler, Entrepreneur/Engineer, Desert Community Robotics.“As I use very thin-walled (20 mils) egg-shells for casting ear plugs, your super speed 3D-printers would work perfect. My vision is to also offer instant manufacturing of the ear plugs similar to all these express photo shops in the past: ""Get your photos within an hour!""- Tony Levander, CEO/Owner, ILICON AB
“I can see it being really good to use among students like me in Universities because it’s so reliable and tough. I look forward to using it for prototyping of my university projects.”- Jacob Murray, QUT Student“ As a Research Assistant at McMaster University, managing the 3D printing technology of our lab is one of my primary responsibilities. The ratio of ""amount of different printers we have"" vs. ""printer innovation"" is pretty poor. Every printer on the market seems like a ""Version 2.0"" of the printer before it.  Half the purpose of our lab is to teach about machines, and the other half is to pump out quality and consistent prints. If every printer we have works almost exactly the same as the one beside it; slow, inconsistent, limited in design, or completely closed box, I've often wondered why we bother with so many different ""run of the mill"" printers.
That's why I'm so excited about the Gizmo 3D.Finally a printer that breaks the mould and doesn't copy it's competition!The whole purpose of 3D printing is re-invention and innovation.”- James Hutton, Research Assistant, McMaster University
Testimonials
This technology is so advanced that there are people who find it hard to believe that it exists. We don’t expect you to just take our word for it, so here’s some testimonials from our beta testers, and more people who have seen these machines in action themselves:Beta testers: (In addition to the videos at the top of the campaign)
“The Gizmo 3D sets itself apart in a few areas.  It’s much faster than the regular FDM machines whilst not compromising on the output quality.  Its robust parts means that it is very reliable in terms of its printing with repeatable results.  This in itself, allows you to fine tune very quickly – you can adjust for very quick printing for prototyping or slow down and attain a quality finish similar to mass manufactured parts.  In some prints, it rivals our polyjet machine whilst being more reliable.  It’s a lot simpler to operate compared to other laser SLS machines – the top down action means that there’s no complicated peeling required and you don’t have to worry about uncured debris blocking the print.  Just stir and print. “- Kin Ly FBE FabLab, University of New South Wales CES 2016 attendees:










Our vision and mission
Vision Statement:To keep on delivering an innovative, top-quality product that the 3D printing community can believe in, while keeping our pricing competitive and giving our customers the printing experience they deserve.Mission Statement:Our mission is to connect the global 3D printing community with innovative, high-quality 3D printers and accessories, allowing them to pursue their passion at a price they can afford.We strive to make 3D printing fast, fun and efficient for our users, and the starting point is what we hope to be a successful Indiegogo campaign. With this funding, we will have the opportunity to grow our organisation and to reach our full potential.
Risks and Challenges
Continuing to reduce production issuesWe have already completed a small production run of 4 beta machines and a pre-production run of 15 printers, so we know that we can deliver. Our suppliers are already in place, we have our shipment channels, our TNT accounts and DHL accounts all set up and already in operation. We have already sent printers to locations all over the globe, including France, Vietnam, Taiwan, multiple USA cities, Canada and Australia.
The initial teething troubles and issues we experienced were all dealt with accordingly, and the experience we gained during those production runs prepared us well for the upcoming Indiegogo production run. With all this in place, we are certain that we won’t let our backers down.
Delayed shipping & damaged goodsCurrently, shipping times are between 4 and 6 months. The printers will be shipped from Vietnam in wooden crates, which have been specifically designed to prevent damage in transit. Easing the learning curve for backersThis is cutting edge technology, and as such, there will always be something of a learning curve for users to get to grips with.
We have a panel of reputable beta testers, who have provided us with feedback regarding this. We will make this information available to the public via tutorials, a quick-start guide and a more detailed handbook, as well as using their feedback to further hone our products and enhance the experience for the end user.
Building our inventoryWe are actively looking for debt funding that will allow us to build more 3D printers that can be ordered from our website immediately after the campaign is completed.
JealousyUsers of our machines may be subjected to jealousy in the workplace. This is natural. Our advice in dealing with this is as follows; give away 3D prints as gifts and peace offerings. You will be printing them so fast and so cheaply anyway, using our affordable resin.

Other ways you can help
Spread the word!Every day that passes by is a huge loss to many industries and organisations that could be benefitting from this technology. You can help to put this right by spreading the word about this breakthrough technology. Don’t let the world miss out any longer; use word of mouth, social media, blog platforms and whatever you can to get the word out there. Every effort helps and is very much appreciated!FAQ
Have a question? If the info below doesn't answer your question, you can ask the project creator directly or email info@gizmo3Dprinters.com.au.____________________________________________________________________________
What color is the included resin?It is the red that you see being used in most of our 3D print photos.Can you tell me the technical differences between the GiziMate 130 and the GiziPro 130?
The GiziPro can be upgraded by the user to add a vat that will allow prints that are 390mm tall where the tallest vat that can be installed in the GiziMate is a 260mm tall vat.
The GiziPro is taller so you can move the projector assembly further away from the vat .  This means you don't need to lower the wide vat that much to get to the 400mm wide projection area.  With the GiziMate you need to lower the wide vat to the bottom to achieve the 400mm wide projection area.  This means the GiziPro can print taller objects when using the wide vat compared to the GiziMate.
Why do the GiziMate 130 Basic, GiziPro 130 Basic and GiziMax 130 Basic all come with the same build volume? I don't see what the advantage is of purchasing the more expensive ones. It seems the Pro and Max should come with a larger build plate as standard.It is because our machines grows with the user, so when you purchase a machine, it comes with the standard sized vat and build plate and when you want to scale to make bigger prints, you can just buy the larger vat and build plate that you need. The advantage is - if you have the bigger machine already, you can upgrade to the bigger vat and build plate anytime when you have the money to do so.Why is the GiziMate 390 Basic the only one where the Indiegogo price is the same as the MSRP ($4100)? All the others have a special Indiegogo launch price, why not this one?It does  have a special Indiegogo launch price, you just picked up a mistake we made with the MSRP price - it should have been listed as MSRP $4550. Because someone has already backed it, that figure cant be changed in the perks. The price of the printer is correct though.Why is shipping not included in the price?Global shipping prices vary. It is much cheaper for the user to handle this on a country-by-country basis.How much is the international shipping cost?The price of shipping varies depending on what country you live in. Unfortunately, international shipping is far from simple; different countries levy different taxes and charges against shipping. Because of this, we ask that the buyer assumes responsibility for such charges when ordering a Gizmo 3D printer.
When will my Gizmo 3D Printer arrive?Your printer will arrive between 4 and 6 months after the Indiegogo campaign ends on 31 March 2016 (unless otherwise specified in the perks section).Can I use third party resins with the Gizmo 3D Printer?In theory, any DLP compatible resin will work. However, we can only guarantee that resins we have personally tested will work with our machines. Can you print a sample of my own file?At this time we are very busy on getting the Gizmo 3D Printer out the door so we are currently unable to provide individual samples.  We are working on this and will post updates via the Indiegogo page when we are able to offer this service. 
Will Gizmo 3D Printers offer a warranty or support?At the moment we are unable to provide specific details in terms of warranty and support, but we are in the process of developing this. However, we can guarantee that the printer you will receive will be in full working order, and we can tell you that we are planning to take extra special care of the supporters who have been with us from the beginning.
Do you have plans for making a bigger printer?This is part of our long term aim, although nothing concrete has been designed as yet.
What comes with my Gizmo 3D Printer?The Gizmo 3D Printer comes with enough resin to get you started and a hand pump to use when pumping out resin from your vat when you want to switch resins.",18.0,7,"1 Campaign

<p> </p>
<p>Wir kennen uns aus unserer gemeinsamen Schulzeit und haben uns stets über mögliche Geschäftsideen ausgetauscht, wobei wir schließlich beide sehr von der Idee des PRESTIGE PHONE im exklusiven Gold und Silber Design angetan waren. Aus anfänglichen Ideen und ersten realistischen Plänen wurde schnell eine ernsthafte Unternehmung, welche nun unter dem Namen PRESTIGE PHONE bekannt ist.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nachdem die anfänglichen Formalitäten, wie z.B. die Eintragung ins Steuerregister, die Anmeldung des Gewerbes und Ausarbeitung von internen Verträgen mit vollem Ehrgeiz erledigt waren, ging es an die Recherche nach spezialisierten Händlern und Auftragsfertiger, die die essentiellen Komponenten zeitnah und in höchstmöglicher Qualität liefern können. Nach andauernden Telefonaten und Preisverhandlungen nahm der Traum von unserem PRESTIGE PHONE immer mehr Form an.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Unsere Kernkompetenzen umfassen die Veredelung des iPhone sowie dessen Vertrieb unter der Eigenmarke PRESTIGE PHONE.</strong></p>

<h2><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">FAQ</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>In welchen Speichergrößen gibt es das PRESTIGE PHONE ?</strong></p>
<p>Das PRESTIGE PHONE 4S gibt es lediglich in der 16GB Variante. Allerdings ist das PRESTIGE PHONE 5 in den Speichergrößen 16GB, 32GB und 64GB erhältlich. Der Aufpreis für die 32GB Ausführung beträgt 110 € und für die 64GB Ausführung 220 €.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Ist der im PRESTIGE PHONE 4S Gold verarbeitete Mittelrahmen aus echtem Gold und wie verhält sich goldene Display ?</strong></p>
<p>Die verarbeiteten Komponenten des Mittelrahmens sind mit 24-karätigem Gold galvanisiert. Das goldene Display ist während des Gebrauchs völlig farbneutral und beeinträchtigt in keinerlei Weise die Funktionalität.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Ist der im PRESTIGEPHONE 4S Silber verarbeitet Mittelrahmen aus echtem Silber ?</strong></p>
<p>Der Mittelrahmen dieses Modells wurde von Hand geschliffen und aufpoliert, entspricht jedoch in seiner Ursprungsform den Materialien des Apple iPhone 4S und ist folglich aus hochwertigem Edelstahl.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Warum gibt es keine Bilder vom PRESTIGE PHONE 5 ?</strong></p>
<p>Da sich das PRESTIGE PHONE 5 noch in einen frühen Entwicklungsstatus befindet, sind hierzu noch keine öffentlichen Bilder publiziert. In Kürze folgen erste Impressionen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Warum ist ein schwarzer Punkt neben der Kamera bei dem PRESTIGE PHONE 4S in Silber zu sehen ?</strong></p>
<p>Da es sich hierbei um einen Prototyp handelt, ist dieser Punkt zwecks Versuchen entstanden. Bei der Verkaufsware ist dieser Punkt selbstverständlich nicht vorhanden.</p>
<b>Warum ist das Display des PRESTIGE PHONE 4S Silber</b><b> nicht silber ?</b><br/>Auf Grund von der Opazität von Silber ist dies technisch nicht möglich.<br/><br/><p><strong>Ist eine persönliche Gravur möglich ?</strong></p>
<p>Zurzeit ist eine persönliche Gravur, wie z.B. der eigene Name noch nicht möglich. Falls es in naher Zukunft doch möglich ist und genauere Konditionen feststehen, teilen wir dies öffentlich mit.</p>

<p>In the following, you will get a short introduction of ourselves:</p>
<p><strong>Tobias Hamacher:</strong></p>
<p>-18 year-old graduate</p>
<p>-experienced as an independent entrepreneur, especially in the area of 3D-Printing</p>
<p>-lives in Brühl near to Cologne</p>
<p>-predestined by his IT knowledge, as well his affinity for technology</p>

<p><strong>Felix Neumair:</strong></p>
<p>-18 year-old graduate in economy</p>
<p>-lives in Brühl near to Cologne</p>
<p>-possesses a fundamental knowledge in the commercial sector</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before Felix changed to his economy school, we used to be in the same grade. In our break times we always shared our business ideas, until we finally were totally obsessed by the idea of PRESTIGE PHONE. It is an amazing mobile phone with a significant and exclusive gold and silver design. Initial thoughts were thought out and first realistic plans were realized. After a brief time a serious company has risen under the name of PRESTIGE PHONE.<br/> </p>
<p>After we completed all formalities with full ambition, such as the entry in the VAT register, the registration of the trade and development of internal contracts, we started to research for qualified distributors and contract manufacturers that can provide the essential components in a timely manner and at the highest possible quality.<br/>Due to persistent calls and price negotiations we could take a step forward to our dream of PRESTIGE PHONE.<br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>Our key competencies include the ennoblement of the iPhone and its marketing under the brand name PRESTIGE PHONE.</strong></p>

Über uns
 
Wir -Tobias Hamacher und Felix Neumair- bilden das Team von:
 
PRESTIGE PHONE
prestigephone.de
 
Im Folgenden stellen wir uns kurz vor:
Tobias Hamacher:
- 18-jähriger Abiturient
- erste Erfahrung in der Selbstständigkeit , speziell im Bereich 3D-Druck
- wohnhaft in Brühl bei Köln
- überzeugt durch seine IT-Kenntnisse und seine Affinität für Technik
 
Felix Neumair:
- 18-jähriger Wirtschafts-Abiturient
- ebenfalls wohnhaft in Brühl
- besitzt fundierte Kenntnisse im kaufmännischen Bereich
 
Wir kennen uns aus unserer gemeinsamen Schulzeit und haben uns stets über mögliche Geschäftsideen ausgetauscht, wobei wir schließlich beide sehr von der Idee des PRESTIGE PHONE im exklusiven Gold und Silber Design angetan waren. Aus anfänglichen Ideen und ersten realistischen Plänen wurde schnell eine ernsthafte Unternehmung, welche nun unter dem Namen PRESTIGE PHONE bekannt ist.
 
Nachdem die anfänglichen Formalitäten, wie z.B. die Eintragung ins Steuerregister, die Anmeldung des Gewerbes und Ausarbeitung von internen Verträgen mit vollem Ehrgeiz erledigt waren, ging es an die Recherche nach spezialisierten Händlern und Auftragsfertiger, die die essentiellen Komponenten zeitnah und in höchstmöglicher Qualität liefern können. Nach andauernden Telefonaten und Preisverhandlungen nahm der Traum von unserem PRESTIGE PHONE immer mehr Form an.
 
Unsere Kernkompetenzen umfassen die Veredelung des iPhone sowie dessen Vertrieb unter der Eigenmarke PRESTIGE PHONE.
 
 

 
 
Wir verwenden ausschließlich neue, hochwertige Komponenten und Materialien als Ausgangsbasis, um technische Komplikationen von Anfang an zu vermeiden, wodurch wir ebenfalls ein hohes Maß an Qualität gewährleisten.
 

 
Kollektion
 





 

 
Der Anlass für unser Crowdfunding-Projekt
 
Wir sammeln Kapital über Indiegogo, damit wir unser PRESTIGE PHONE fertigen können. Dieses bieten wir in den Varianten Gold und Silber an. Das PRESTIGE PHONE 4S basiert auf dem iPhone 4S. Der Nachfolger, das Apple iPhone 5, dient wiederum als Grundlage für unser PRESTIGE PHONE 5.
 
Damit wir die Produkte zu einem angemessenen Preis anbieten können, versuchen wir in einer Größenordnung zu fertigen, welche bessere Konditionen ermöglicht.
 
Wir als Jungunternehmer investieren so gut es geht eigenes Kapital um das Unternehmen voran zu bringen, jedoch ist uns bewusst, dass unser Ziel lediglich durch zusätzliches Fremdkapital realistisch umsetzbar ist.
 
Wir bitten Sie, uns zu unterstützen, damit wir langfristig erfolgreich handeln können und eine finanzielle Stütze für unsere Studiengänge schaffen.

FAQ
 
In welchen Speichergrößen gibt es das PRESTIGE PHONE ?
Das PRESTIGE PHONE 4S gibt es lediglich in der 16GB Variante. Allerdings ist das PRESTIGE PHONE 5 in den Speichergrößen 16GB, 32GB und 64GB erhältlich. Der Aufpreis für die 32GB Ausführung beträgt 110 € und für die 64GB Ausführung 220 €.

Die verarbeiteten Komponenten des Mittelrahmens sind mit 24-karätigem Gold galvanisiert. Das goldene Display ist während des Gebrauchs völlig farbneutral und beeinträchtigt in keinerlei Weise die Funktionalität.
 
Ist der im PRESTIGEPHONE 4S Silber verarbeitet Mittelrahmen aus echtem Silber ?
Der Mittelrahmen dieses Modells wurde von Hand geschliffen und aufpoliert, entspricht jedoch in seiner Ursprungsform den Materialien des Apple iPhone 4S und ist folglich aus hochwertigem Edelstahl.
 
Warum gibt es keine Bilder vom PRESTIGE PHONE 5 ?
Da sich das PRESTIGE PHONE 5 noch in einen frühen Entwicklungsstatus befindet, sind hierzu noch keine öffentlichen Bilder publiziert. In Kürze folgen erste Impressionen.
 
Warum ist ein schwarzer Punkt neben der Kamera bei dem PRESTIGE PHONE 4S in Silber zu sehen ?
Da es sich hierbei um einen Prototyp handelt, ist dieser Punkt zwecks Versuchen entstanden. Bei der Verkaufsware ist dieser Punkt selbstverständlich nicht vorhanden.
Warum ist das Display des PRESTIGE PHONE 4S Silber nicht silber ?Auf Grund von der Opazität von Silber ist dies technisch nicht möglich.Ist eine persönliche Gravur möglich ?
Zurzeit ist eine persönliche Gravur, wie z.B. der eigene Name noch nicht möglich. Falls es in naher Zukunft doch möglich ist und genauere Konditionen feststehen, teilen wir dies öffentlich mit.
 
Wie lauten die Allgemeine Geschäftsbedingungen ?
Unser AGB finden sie auf prestigephone.de/agb.html sowie die der Indiegogo, Inc. auf indiegogo.com/partners/terms .

Before Felix changed to his economy school, we used to be in the same grade. In our break times we always shared our business ideas, until we finally were totally obsessed by the idea of PRESTIGE PHONE. It is an amazing mobile phone with a significant and exclusive gold and silver design. Initial thoughts were thought out and first realistic plans were realized. After a brief time a serious company has risen under the name of PRESTIGE PHONE. 
After we completed all formalities with full ambition, such as the entry in the VAT register, the registration of the trade and development of internal contracts, we started to research for qualified distributors and contract manufacturers that can provide the essential components in a timely manner and at the highest possible quality.Due to persistent calls and price negotiations we could take a step forward to our dream of PRESTIGE PHONE.
Our key competencies include the ennoblement of the iPhone and its marketing under the brand name PRESTIGE PHONE.
 
 

 
 
We use exclusively high quality components and best materials in order to avoid technical complications right away. This is also one the reasons why we can ensure a high standard of quality for our PRESTIGE PHONE.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Last year I set out to learn about neural networks. It was way harder than it needed to be! Everything I needed to know was scattered between random pdf documents, blog posts and academic papers on arXiv. There were other tutorials and MOOCs - but they were very theoretical, whilst <strong>I just wanted to get started and code</strong>.</p>
<p>So now I want to create what I wish I'd had - a <strong>neural networks MOOC aimed at hackers</strong>. After completing the course, you should be broadly familiar with ways neural networks are used, be able to understand the academic literature, be able to set up a deep learning rig, and of course, hack on your own projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>My background: software engineer, Maths &amp; CS degree from Cambridge, formerly worked at Oculus, a16z.</li>
<li>Spent 1 year reading about ML to broaden my horizons</li>
<li>Now want to create the class I wish I'd had.</li>
</ul>

There were other tutorials and MOOCs - but they were very theoretical, whilst I just wanted to get started and code.
So now I want to create what I wish I'd had - a neural networks MOOC aimed at hackers. After completing the course, you should be broadly familiar with ways neural networks are used, be able to understand the academic literature, be able to set up a deep learning rig, and of course, hack on your own projects.

My background: software engineer, Maths & CS degree from Cambridge, formerly worked at Oculus, a16z.
Spent 1 year reading about ML to broaden my horizons
Now want to create the class I wish I'd had.

The prerequisites to the class will be - calculus and basic ability to code.
What We Need & What You Get

This is course on deep learning for people who want to dive straight in! Without dwelling too much on theory, this course provides everything you need to start building stuff using neural nets.
Includes:

what software packages and frameworks to use
training models using GPUs, setting up a cluster in the cloud
a broad overview of algorithms used in neural networks - in plain English
understanding the vocabulary used in deep learning academic papers
how to keep up with the deep learning literature
interesting project ideas so you can start building right away

The specific topics covered are:

Backpropagation 
Clustering
Convnets 
Variational autoencoders 
Natural Language Processing 
Hacks and optimizations 
Reinforcement learning 

The premium version of the course includes

A dedicated Slack chatroom where you can ask any questions you may have
A personalized reading list of ML papers relevant to your particular field (for example, game development)

You can check out a sample post here.
NEW: Check out a sample screencast here.
Risks & ChallengesMost of the course has already been written. The funds will be spent on living expenses whilst I improve the design, edit the content for readability, & add more diagrams, audio recordings and screencasts.

<p>Hello Indiegogo! We are Moodtek, and we are a married couple with two handsome little boys.</p>
<p>Here is some background: She studied photography, Anthropology and is certified in Clinical Hypnotherapy. He studied photography and computer science! We love art and so do our children. Our company goal has always been, quite simply, to provide products that can help change one's mood! We believe that the changing of moods can start the process of changing one's thinking and thus, changing their life!</p>

<p>To that end, we created a card game called MEMEOLOGY! It is an ""idea-matching"" game based around internet memes. It was released to minimal fanfare. We soon decided that for our brand to take off we needed to expand our horizons.</p>
<p>Our vision was to have a store (placed near the local university) where we could both work as graphic artists, allowing both of us to be able to quit our taxing day jobs and be with our children full-time! The store would offer eccentric mood-changing products like funky lights, incence, craftsman games, and apparel. We also had plans to rent rack space to local artists so they could get more eyes on their work. In addition to that, we wished to offer 3D printing services at extremely competitive rates for our fellow art/engineering/fashion/architecture students at our local colleges.</p>

<p>The idea was refined, refined and refined again until, finally, in 2013, we opened a ""mom and pop"" brick-and-mortar shop in sunny Riverside, California that offers our customers totally custom T-shirts and accessories, (quickly!) to our community! We offer the <em>absolute</em> <em>lowest</em> prices for custom T-shirts in the area. We cannot be beat!</p>

<h3>We need your help!</h3>
<p>For the past several months the PerSociety (P.S.) team has been working on a mobile app that will help manage business cards you receive and how you store them in the future.</p>
<p>To make our app most user friendly, we need to finish off an OCR (optical character reader) component allowing you to take a picture of any business card and immediately scan the info to be merged into your P.S. phone book. The OCR will be implemented on our Android, and iOS apps. We intend to have the OCR project completed by early December.</p>
<h1>Boring...or so you might think...</h1>
<p>Most people probably think that business cards are a thing of the past...you got Facebook, Linkedin, outlook, etc...who uses business cards these days?</p>
<p>Think again...business cards are the easiest way for us to remember those we meet at various places. Even meeting someone at a bar or even a coffee shop, jotting a name and number on a piece of paper beats entering a name and number in your contact phonebook without seeing where it came from or who that name or number is.</p>
<p>In addition to looking someone up on Facebook and Linkedin, having a business card to touch, hold and see helps us remember a person. Put a face to name, put a name to a number, put a card to the face, name and number. And that's what P.S. is all about.</p>
<h1>Our Solution</h1>
<p>The Persociety cloud will let you create a contact profile, allow you to tag each contact with a business card and any other piece of info forever. Our solution is cloud based so you can access it from anywhere, anytime. One person commented our beta mobile app an electronic rolodex. Ours is more beautiful than that.</p>
<h1>The Beauty</h1>
<p>We do more than simply saving business card images; when the business card is uploaded to our server, you have the option to invite your contact to join ""insociety"" and link their real time profile to yours. The beauty of ""insociety"" is that once your contacts become part of your network you could request anyone to update their info at any times. You'll no longer have old business cards in your ""virtual desk""</p>
<h1>Our Story</h1>
<p>Persociety is a startup with no outside funding other than the hard work and savings of our five co-founders, who all recognized a need to address a common problem with business cards.</p>

What Are People Saying About Us?








Our Plans...
 What are we going to do with $20,000?  Great question...  Build the Google Play Version (we don't discriminate).  A redesign of the website to allow online orders.
iPods:  We need to provide every store we work with an iPod touch, which in turn will allow us to serve them with ease.
We will be hiring drivers to give you an amazing experience every time you order.
We need to seek legal counsel every time we expand, as laws frequently change within every city and state.
Marketing - what's the point of having the best delivery app if no one knows about it? We need to spread the word!



What Impact Will Tipsy Make? We are glad you asked...  Our company will drive more business to Mom and Pop liquor stores, so they can keep the lights on. Every city added to our network will create jobs to further help the community. Tipsy will continue to work hard to keep drunk drivers from getting behind the wheel. 


      

   What Are Our Challenges? The problem we face is that the sale and distribution of alcohol changes in every city and state.  We need to make sure we comply with all liquor laws to make this dream a reality -  we can't do it without your help!

We can simply divide users into two categories. Advanced users and beginner users.</p><h3>Beginner Users:</h3><p>watchX is Arduino compatible. It will be loaded with Arduino Uno Bootloader for beginners. To program the watch, just download the Arduino IDE and plug the watchX to the USB port. USB drivers will automatically be installed. Then you should choose Arduino Uno from tools/boards/arduino uno, then you can write your own code or simply download a sample sketch from our web site and program the watch.</p><p>watchX is scratch compatible. You just download the Scratch and install the firmware required to be installed to watchX in order for the watch to communicate with Scratch. You can choose “pre-load Scratch firmware” option while you are purchasing watchX or you can install it by yourself, it’s easy. Just copy provided code, paste it to Arduino IDE and send the code to watch, you are all set.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504341296/q5bwyzff3cwglnszdtlp.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>Advanced Users:</h3><p>watchX has ISP programming capability. You can develop your code through atmel studio and program the IC through ISP. Remember that you need an ISP programmer for doing this, any Arduino can be used as ISP programmer as well. We will provide you a detailed explanation about how to develop your code at Atmel studio and program the IC using ISP. You can simply burn the IC with arduino uno bootloader and use it as arduino uno as well.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504341278/vyknoczoet7ojlb63gw5.png"" src=""""/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Software</h2><p>watchX firmware you saw on video:<br/>watchX has an excellent firmware thanks to ZAK, almost everything is animated nice and beautiful . <br/>watchX firmware has apps like:</p><p><strong>Alarms:</strong> You can set-up up to 10 alarms, each alarm has the hour, minute and which the days of the week it should be active on.</p><p><strong>Flashlight:</strong> It is crazy, we recommend you to use it at a party, it’s cool.</p><p><strong>Stopwatch:</strong> You can start and stop stopwatch, it can also run in the background.</p><p><strong>Games:</strong> We have two fun games that you saw on video, it’s amusing what this little puppy can do isn’t it:)</p><p><strong>Settings:</strong> Settings have four sub-categories. You can increase or decrease display brightness. You have volume control in UI, alarms and hour beep. You can set display sleep time-out to increase battery life. And you can invert the screen also you can turn on/off animations.</p><p><strong>An app that you can run your own code:</strong> This app will run your own code. There is a section in the software where you can write your own code. Once you write your code and send it to the watch, you can navigate to the app from menu to run your code. You can also add other apps to menu.</p><p>We designed watchX, software in mind. We tried to use ICs that are popular in Arduino/maker community for sample code availability and IC familiarity. For instance, we used MPU 6050 as accelerometer/gyroscope.</p><p>If you are not satisfied with our sample code, you can reach lot’s of sample code sources online like Adafruit or Sparkfun.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Charging/Battery Life:</h2><p>watchX equipped with <strong>intelligent charging circuitry</strong>. When you connect the watch to a USB port or another power source, charging circuitry disconnects the battery from an electrical load of watchX and starts to charge it. Required power of watchX during charging is supplied from the power source. This way, the battery does not discharge while charging. When battery is fully charged, charging IC stops charging.</p><p>This gives you the advantage of using your watchX for different applications where you need long constant power at remote locations. You can use watchX without worrying about battery overcharge! In case of electrical black out the watchX battery will kick in.</p><p>While the watch is running, microcontroller tries to go to sleep as much as possible. In sleep mode, power consumption can be around 0,8 mA - 2 mA. In sleep mode microcontroller turns the OLED display off and goes into power down sleep mode where it is only woken by either a button press, an RTC alarm or USB being plugged in. In this state, microcontroller draws around 100nA. In sleep mode overall current draw is around 6uA. In normal usage current draw is around 10mA this can increase up to 70mA.</p><p>        - During sleep mode(6uA): ~2.8 years<br/>        - Typical usage (10mA): ~15 hours<br/>        - High (65mA): ~ 2 hours.</p><p><i>*If the watch is used in active mode for 1 minute a day and volume channels set to minimum, watch battery should last around 1 year and 3 months.</i></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Hardware</h2><p>Let’s start with MCU, we used <strong>atmega328p</strong> to cover all users from a variety of age. We are aware of the atmega328p is a little underpowered for advanced users however; it will still do the trick;)</p><p>We have <strong>1.3 128x64 SSD1306 OLED Display</strong> on board. The way we connect the display to the board is unique. Usually, OLED displays are soldered on PCB, there is nothing wrong about this, however; OLED displays can be very fragile if you don’t protect them. Once you break the display unsolder-solder process is very painful. We used flat flex connector(FFC) type OLED display. If you broke the display you can simply pop up the connector hand and change the OLED. Another advantage of FFC connector type OLED is you can take off the display and use the board for applications that don’t require a display in a harsh environment.</p><p><strong>The battery does not require soldering!</strong> We used a very slim connector to connect the battery to the board, this will allow you to change the battery once your battery dies or when you want to use a higher capacity battery. When you are not using the watch you can also disconnect the battery to store the watch safely.</p><p>We have 3 tactile switches. You can use these switches for navigating at watch menu. Switches will be handy on your own development as well.</p><p>We have two general purpose green LEDs under the display.</p><p>watchX packed with many features and sensors. It’s really very hard to describe every feature of it. It’s totally different to experience watchX in real life instead of reading the specs. We hope you will love it.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Housing</h2><p>watchX does not include any housing because:</p><p><strong>It’s freaking cool to have a PCB in watch style.</strong></p><p>It will force you to learn 3D design. Remember as humans we only learn something if we need it! You will need a housing for watchX sooner or later. Then you will download the 3D design, you will be amused that 3D design includes everything that exists on the real product. Then you will go to the good old friend GOOGLE and type 3D design, for finishing out how to import a STEP file, how to draw something on 3D model etc. Then you will get familiar with the industrial design.</p><p>watchX can be used as something else other than watch. You can set an alarm ( or trigger) to water the plants on certain days of the week. Or you can use it as an outdoor weather station. All these applications require different housing designs. We will give you the 3D model of watchX. There will be everything on the 3D model that you will see on watchX itself(including resistors and capacitors). You won’t need any measurement to draw the case you need for your application. We will also provide you different housing designs ready to download. Then you can print these housings with a 3D printer.</p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Options of watchX</h2><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504020321/nbccbejef53ceuglf3zg.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504020336/jqfooabmpeyauhmpf4yw.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>*Regardless of which one you pick, you can use the one you like after purchase.</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>If I back, what do I get?</strong></h2><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504020353/daktmkc3utlvgnllfyfn.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504512908/rkdhezhumahuapts4n7o.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504020389/aaizcvddapygebb8jhox.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504020410/skny13lbew9pdqlrhzge.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505040419/iqp1eunzjbsewdauaobg.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507709858/cawgyzkdrzluumcranpk.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504020460/wrtwncx6o92s7yebblfk.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504020541/kocv83h6h4ze02elktlo.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504020554/mi9axqpjaq0va0huhus0.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504020568/wod0fno7zgwb1ajrin4c.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504020581/pf6kcgqprmufqlh8rolo.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504020594/i1blvkv4bucshycfxfvu.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Stretch Goals</strong></h2><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504020616/meiop42om27gkqymxnyz.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504020630/qe0kf3cytlzrqmjmycjj.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504020646/shsacvqnmi6uikuwda7n.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504020665/g7lvifw0xrxaewfwtjln.png"" src=""""/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why we are in INDIEGOGO</h2><p>We are a group of engineers who left their job and put their time and money to develop watchX.

Check out our new campaign! Let’s face it, cables, old development platform, expensive sensors, a breadboard, a power source, more cables… this just doesn’t fit with the new generation of developers. We want to change this! We have two main ideas behind the watchX:1- Use what you make!2- Learn Industrial design!3- Be the next Elon MUSK (just kidding, remember I said two). watchX is delivered to the customers all around the world!  What is watchX?watchX is an Arduino/Scratch compatible wearable development board that will extend your imagination because you wear it! You can use watchX as a regular watch when you don’t use it for development purposes. It has a freaking cool design and mind blowing watch firmware that is packed into a cool design.OK! It’s time to move on from the desk to the wrist. We are so excited for what you can do with watchX! * The referance 3D model for 3D Printing will be published.* Educational video about how to design your own case is coming soon.* The watchX that you see in the pictures are prototypes.Final watchX will be the same as 360 3D model. It’s Arduino compatible!
We all love Arduino, it’s simple, there is a lot of documentation available, it’s just amazing. watchX without Arduino is unthinkable. watchX is Arduino compatible, this means; when you plug the watchX to your computer all you need to do is to open up your favorite Arduino IDE and start programming. It’s Scratch compatible!We all love our kids, we care them a lot. We want them to eat the healthiest food and we wish the best for their future. Actually, there is more you can do than just wishing the best! watchX is Scratch compatible so that kids can get their hands on watchX easily. watchX engages kids a lot; because, they use what they make! This drives them to develop next day and increase their excitement!Result: happy young developers. Advanced users:
watchX is a development platform for all, we did not limited watchX to Arduino and Scratch. You can compile your code using Atmel Studio and program the watchX. All the low-level code and libraries will be provided so that you can focus on your idea. There are lots of things we can do together!  Grand VisionwatchX and its current state is just the tip of the iceberg. Only a huge community of developers and makers can unlock the true potential of watchX. This is exactly what we dream of, a huge community of developers exchanging information, developing cool apps and games. There are cool features waiting to be developed such as a mobile app that will allow watchX to be used as a smartwatch. Remember great things in life never done by a single person, they are done by a team of people. Do what you can’t!We tend to believe that great stuff will come up from extraordinary people, this is not true!! With the right tools and gadgets, anyone can accomplish great things. It’s just a matter of taking the first step!We believe that watchX will serve for anyone to accomplish, next big thing in wearables, electronics or industrial design! The true potential of watchX is within you! Here is just a few example of what you could build: Specifications Programming the WatchwatchX is a development board for users from a variety of age. We can simply divide users into two categories. Advanced users and beginner users.Beginner Users:watchX is Arduino compatible. It will be loaded with Arduino Uno Bootloader for beginners. To program the watch, just download the Arduino IDE and plug the watchX to the USB port. USB drivers will automatically be installed. Then you should choose Arduino Uno from tools/boards/arduino uno, then you can write your own code or simply download a sample sketch from our web site and program the watch.watchX is scratch compatible. You just download the Scratch and install the firmware required to be installed to watchX in order for the watch to communicate with Scratch. You can choose “pre-load Scratch firmware” option while you are purchasing watchX or you can install it by yourself, it’s easy. Just copy provided code, paste it to Arduino IDE and send the code to watch, you are all set.Advanced Users:watchX has ISP programming capability. You can develop your code through atmel studio and program the IC through ISP. Remember that you need an ISP programmer for doing this, any Arduino can be used as ISP programmer as well. We will provide you a detailed explanation about how to develop your code at Atmel studio and program the IC using ISP. You can simply burn the IC with arduino uno bootloader and use it as arduino uno as well.SoftwarewatchX firmware you saw on video:watchX has an excellent firmware thanks to ZAK, almost everything is animated nice and beautiful . watchX firmware has apps like:Alarms: You can set-up up to 10 alarms, each alarm has the hour, minute and which the days of the week it should be active on.Flashlight: It is crazy, we recommend you to use it at a party, it’s cool.Stopwatch: You can start and stop stopwatch, it can also run in the background.Games: We have two fun games that you saw on video, it’s amusing what this little puppy can do isn’t it:)Settings: Settings have four sub-categories. You can increase or decrease display brightness. You have volume control in UI, alarms and hour beep. You can set display sleep time-out to increase battery life. And you can invert the screen also you can turn on/off animations.An app that you can run your own code: This app will run your own code. There is a section in the software where you can write your own code. Once you write your code and send it to the watch, you can navigate to the app from menu to run your code. You can also add other apps to menu.We designed watchX, software in mind. We tried to use ICs that are popular in Arduino/maker community for sample code availability and IC familiarity. For instance, we used MPU 6050 as accelerometer/gyroscope.If you are not satisfied with our sample code, you can reach lot’s of sample code sources online like Adafruit or Sparkfun.Charging/Battery Life:watchX equipped with intelligent charging circuitry. When you connect the watch to a USB port or another power source, charging circuitry disconnects the battery from an electrical load of watchX and starts to charge it. Required power of watchX during charging is supplied from the power source. This way, the battery does not discharge while charging. When battery is fully charged, charging IC stops charging.This gives you the advantage of using your watchX for different applications where you need long constant power at remote locations. You can use watchX without worrying about battery overcharge! In case of electrical black out the watchX battery will kick in.While the watch is running, microcontroller tries to go to sleep as much as possible. In sleep mode, power consumption can be around 0,8 mA - 2 mA. In sleep mode microcontroller turns the OLED display off and goes into power down sleep mode where it is only woken by either a button press, an RTC alarm or USB being plugged in. In this state, microcontroller draws around 100nA. In sleep mode overall current draw is around 6uA. In normal usage current draw is around 10mA this can increase up to 70mA.        - During sleep mode(6uA): ~2.8 years        - Typical usage (10mA): ~15 hours        - High (65mA): ~ 2 hours.*If the watch is used in active mode for 1 minute a day and volume channels set to minimum, watch battery should last around 1 year and 3 months.HardwareLet’s start with MCU, we used atmega328p to cover all users from a variety of age. We are aware of the atmega328p is a little underpowered for advanced users however; it will still do the trick;)We have 1.3 128x64 SSD1306 OLED Display on board. The way we connect the display to the board is unique. Usually, OLED displays are soldered on PCB, there is nothing wrong about this, however; OLED displays can be very fragile if you don’t protect them. Once you break the display unsolder-solder process is very painful. We used flat flex connector(FFC) type OLED display. If you broke the display you can simply pop up the connector hand and change the OLED. Another advantage of FFC connector type OLED is you can take off the display and use the board for applications that don’t require a display in a harsh environment.The battery does not require soldering! We used a very slim connector to connect the battery to the board, this will allow you to change the battery once your battery dies or when you want to use a higher capacity battery. When you are not using the watch you can also disconnect the battery to store the watch safely.We have 3 tactile switches. You can use these switches for navigating at watch menu. Switches will be handy on your own development as well.We have two general purpose green LEDs under the display.watchX packed with many features and sensors. It’s really very hard to describe every feature of it. It’s totally different to experience watchX in real life instead of reading the specs. We hope you will love it.HousingwatchX does not include any housing because:It’s freaking cool to have a PCB in watch style.It will force you to learn 3D design. Remember as humans we only learn something if we need it! You will need a housing for watchX sooner or later. Then you will download the 3D design, you will be amused that 3D design includes everything that exists on the real product. Then you will go to the good old friend GOOGLE and type 3D design, for finishing out how to import a STEP file, how to draw something on 3D model etc. Then you will get familiar with the industrial design.watchX can be used as something else other than watch. You can set an alarm ( or trigger) to water the plants on certain days of the week. Or you can use it as an outdoor weather station. All these applications require different housing designs. We will give you the 3D model of watchX. There will be everything on the 3D model that you will see on watchX itself(including resistors and capacitors). You won’t need any measurement to draw the case you need for your application. We will also provide you different housing designs ready to download. Then you can print these housings with a 3D printer. Options of watchX*Regardless of which one you pick, you can use the one you like after purchase. If I back, what do I get?  Stretch Goals  Why we are in INDIEGOGOWe are a group of engineers who left their job and put their time and money to develop watchX. We are covering all the expenses of watchX from our savings. We believe that we did well till this point. To move forward we need more money than we can cover. This is where we need you and IndieGoGo. If we can receive enough money from our campaign, we will cover expenses like:- Component sourcing- Printed Circuit Board(PCB) Manufacturing- PCB Assembly- Boxing of watchX- Certification and LicensingAlso, we need a certain number of orders because some components we use require a minimum order quantity limit. We hope you back us on overcoming these problems.Our Road Map After Funding*Manuf. = ManufacturingYour contribution is very important for the success of our campaign.                About the TeamWe are a team of engineers, designers and creative people who enjoy to design and develop hardware that touches people’s lives.

<h3>At a glance - Seeing like a young person again
</h3>
<div>
<p>The eye. It is our most important sensory organ.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be great to see perfectly sharply from near to far like a young person again without the
annoying
glasses.</p>
<p>By the age of 50, everyone is suffering from presbyopia. Opacification of the lens – cataracts – are even
worse: one in two people over 60 gets them, and a further one in two of these are operated on. There are
still no satisfactory solutions to restore natural, healthy eyesight.</p>
<p>This is exactly what we are working on: the new bio-inspired intraocular lens „<b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b>“ by biolnic should soon enable sharp near vision and far vision. <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> imitates the
incredible softness and elasticity of a healthy, natural lens and also deforms just like one. It's like inventing the fountain of youth for your eyes.</p>
<p>We have a highly promising solution for the problems of presbyopia and cataracts – <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> must be
developed to a marketable stage and a first clinical trial on humans must be carried out. This will take about 2,5 years. For this we need
you!</p>
<p>Make something unique possible: purchase a transferable option on a pair of <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b>
lenses now with a 20%, 40% or 90% discount on the intended market price of $5,000 (4,000€), which you can redeem after achieving
marketability. Or we will pass every of your donations to charitable foundations who help prevent blindness, and in addition, we will donate a pair of <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> every time biolnic raises $500 via your donations, if the project will succeed.</p>
<p>We get 80% of our impressions from healthy eyes. We are working meticulously on
significantly improving our quality of life in old age with <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b>
so that we can live more actively.

<h2>A little bit of medicine first of all</h2>
<div>
<h4>The natural lens </h4>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://biolnic.eu/img/TE_DieNatuerlicheLinse_en.png"" src="""" style=""width: 401.85835694051px; float: right; margin-left: 2%; margin-bottom: 2%; height: 352px;""/>
<p>The lens of the human eye is a crystal-clear, extremely elastic body which bundles the light
that enters
via the pupil onto the retina to create a sharp picture. It is embedded in a wafer-thin
“capsular sac”
which is attached to the ring-formed ciliary muscle by zonula fibers, which radiate
laterally into the
equator of the capsule.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Cataracts and presbyopia</h4>
<p>A particularly serious and slowly progressive disease is <b>cataracts</b>, in which the lenses of
the eye become
opaque, resulting in increased glare sensitivity of the eye and faded perception of colors.
Advanced
cataracts can only be treated through surgery to replace the natural lens with an artificial
intraocular
lens (IOL) after opening of the capsular sac.
</p>
<p><b>Presbyopia</b> is the age-related loss of the adaptability of the eye to different object
distances
(accommodation). This is essentially based on the loss of elasticity in the lens core. This is
normally
corrected using one or more pairs of glasses.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Accommodation</h4>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://biolnic.eu/img/TE_Akkommodation_black.bmp_en.png"" src="""" style=""width: 45%; float: right; display: inline-block; margin-left: 2%;"" title=""If the ciliary muscle is relaxed, the zonula will tighten, stretching the capsular sac over its equator in radial direction. The capsular sac therefore exerts an axial compressive force on the lens which deforms into a slightly curved ellipse shape (far vision). If the ciliary muscle is concentrically narrowed, the zonula fibers will relax and the lens will return to its natural spherical shape as a result of its own elasticity (near vision).""/>
<p>In accommodation - the focusing of the eye - the ring-shaped muscle (“ciliar”) does not exert
any force
on the lens as you would assume. Instead, the zonula fibers relax in the event of
contraction of the
ciliary muscle and the lens switches into its natural spherical shape for near vision. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
examinations
show that the changes in diameter during accommodation of the ciliary muscle are only
slightly different
for young people and old people, at <a rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Strenk et al. Magnetic resonance imaging of aging, accommodating, phakic, and pseudophakic ciliary muscle diameters. J Cataract Refract Surg. 32(11): 1792–1798. "">approximately
0.6 mm</a>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Conventional IOLs</h4>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://biolnic.eu/img/TE_HerkoemmlicheIOLs.png"" src="""" style=""width: 30%; float: right; display: inline-block; margin-left: 2%;""/>
<p>Standard intraocular lenses (IOLs) have only one focus and provide either near or far vision.
</p>
<p>There are also bifocal or multifocal lenses with more than one focus which are not completely
rigid like
the standard IOLs but, however, are unable to accommodate and to change their shape. The
disadvantage of
multifocal lenses is the significantly worse contrast vision and increased glare sensitivity
(particularly at night). In a similar manner to varifocal glasses, the field of vision is
narrower which
results in a non-physiological rocking of the head.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Complications of IOLs</h4>
<p>The most frequent complication arising from the use of intraocular lenses is the opacification of
the
posterior capsule (post-cataract occurrences). This requires additional laser surgery.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Accommodable IOLs</h4>
<div>
<p>Contrary to what is widely assumed, the accommodation of the eye is not yet able to be
returned to a
satisfactory state. Only refractive power changes of about 1.5 diopter can be achieved, but
at least
3 diopter are needed for near and far vision.
</p>
<p>There is a lack of sophisticated biomechanical solutions in which the function of focusing
imitates the
nature function as closely as possible. And this needs to be without the eye or brain having
to shift,
without (optical) mistakes and without electronic aids!
</p>
<p><b>Another shortcoming</b>: the capsular sac “damaged” by opening can compress a flexible IOL
into its
flat condition for far vision only to a very limited extent.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Setting new standards</h4>
<div>
<p>The power transmission that is behind construction and design of the <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> is much more efficient. <span><br/></span>In this,
the IOL is to be
connected to the ciliary muscle directly.</p>

<h2>How “DeepSight” works</h2>

<h4>
How it should work
</h4>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://biolnic.eu/img/DS_HowItWorks_en.png"" src="""" style=""width: 262.425742574257px; float: right; display: inline-block; margin-left: 2%; height: 285px;"" title=""If the ciliary muscle is relaxed, the zonula will tighten, stretching the capsular sac over its equator in radial direction.

<p>The lens-shaped <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> is flat in its distance condition,
just
like its natural model. It consists of a thin, extremely elastic shell and a liquid, highly
refractive
core. The ciliary muscle nestles itself around the “haptic ring”, the edge of the IOL. This
one can
follow the contraction of the ciliary muscle due to the thin slits. The <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> get rounder: near objects become sharp!
</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<p>Our simulations (optical as well as stress and deformation analyses) show that with the
bio-inspired
<b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> a multiple of refractive power change than the
necessary 3 diopter for near to distant vision can be achieved already with less than a
half
diameter change of the ciliar. This has still to be proven in the clinical trial.</p>

<h4>How DeepSight should
be implanted</h4>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://biolnic.eu/img/DS_Z-IOL_V1%20Reservoir.png"" src="""" style=""width: 35%; float: right; display: inline-block; margin-left: 2%;""/>
<div>
<p>The <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> should be implanted in a similarly
uncomplicated
way like conventional IOLs, which can be performed in as little as 10 minutes. For implantation, the capsular sac is removed or shifted
behind the
intraocular lens. The <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> is inserted into the
ciliary muscle. In addition
it can be fixed to the ciliary muscle or eyeball. During implantation, the lens is
pressed flat so
the filling is transferred to a connected tube which is rolled up into a small shape.

<h2>What will make DeepSight unique</h2>
<p><b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> stands out in all of its details by the simplicity of the
design
in the form of a bio-inspired system which is very close to human physiology. The change in shape of the IOL as an indicator for the accommodation capacity is even much higher than that of the natural lens ie from an almost flat far vision state to a highly curved near vision state.</p>
<div>
<h4>These unique selling propositions are our objective</h4>
<ul>
<li>Natural, sharp vision from approximately 25 cm to a distance without further visual aids,
restriction
of the visual field and an adjustment of the eye or brain.
</li>
<li>
<b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> aims to make the most possible use of the muscle
contraction by being fully enclosed by the ciliary muscle and by being extremely deformable
due to the
slits in the haptic ring and liquid core.
</li>
<li>The very large optics provides significantly improved night vision.</li>
<li>The post-cataract occurrences or a decentration are far less likely.</li>
<li>It also aims to help patients suffering from very poor vision.</li>
<li>Lower costs in the long term compared to other visual aids.</li>
<li>Patients with conventional IOLs can replace them with <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b>.

<h3>We go to painstaking lengths to ensure that no stone is left unturned in our quest for the best way
forward to
an accommodative IOL</h3>
<div>
<h4>Where we stand</h4>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://biolnic.eu/img/WWD_WoWirStehen.png"" src="""" style=""width: 27%; float: right; margin-left: 2%; margin-bottom: 2%;""/>
<p>The design of the IOL was developed for attachment to the ciliary muscle. We have therefore
already been
through a long process in which numerous designs of the <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b>
were simulated using complex calculation programs. In addition, it was also possible to
manufacture a
prototype of an extremely complex shaped IOL intended for implantation in the capsular sac
using
state-of-the-art micro technologies – with a partner from Bradford in the European COTECH
Project (<a href=""http://fp7-cotech.eu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.fp7-cotech.eu</a>).
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4>What has to be done</h4>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://biolnic.eu/img/WWD_Zeitplan_en.png"" src="""" style=""width: 55%; float: right; display: inline-block; margin-left: 2%; margin-bottom: 2%;""/>
<p>
A great deal of work is still in front of us. The micro precision manufacturing technology
and the
design of <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> are further optimized in terms of the
plastics
used and tailored to one another. Various different examinations and tests are being carried
out.
Initial pre-production models of the <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> are being
examined
in a clinical pilot investigation with 10 patients in which accommodation ability of the IOL
is being
demonstrated over a period of six months (until mid-2017). Therefore biolnic needs
approximately $2.1 (1.7€) million. And that’s why we need you!</p>
<p>
The subsequent, extensive clinical trial with approximately 400 patients should last for
around two
years. In parallel, automated series production will be established. This can be covered by
EU financing
programs. Marketability of the <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> lens as medical
product
for the European region should then be achieved and the sale by industry partners can begin.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Series production – quality knows no compromises</h4>
<p>
The series production of <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> is likely to be carried out by
biolnic itself and built up together with the partners. </p>
<p>
This is because the highest possible quality standards are always at the forefront!

<h2>Challenges to be mastered</h2>
<h3>Great ideas need robust strategies to turn them into reality</h3>
<div>
<p>Needless to say, many medical technology risks and challenges arise during the development of new
implants
for the human body: </p>
<ul>
<li>The micro injection molding of highly elastic precision components and thus production of <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> are extremely demanding but can be realized with
our
competent partners from the COTECH project.
</li>
<li>The accommodation of <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> must be adequately shown
within
the scope of the clinical trials on humans.
</li>
<li>Furthermore, the precise selection of the correct size of IOL for the ciliary muscle depends
on the
care of the physician and suitable imaging procedures. Ophthalmologists, however, are used
to precision
and care.
</li>
<li>Generally, the long-term behavior of implants cannot be assessed 100% reliably in advance.
But it
should be the same as for the conventional IOL.
</li>
</ul>
<p>It certainly should also be pointed out here that it is possible that in such projects
development steps,
tests or even clinical trials may need to be repeated. This can result in the failure of the
enterprise in
the worst case due to not reaching marketability of the lenses as a medical product and
therefore a loss of
the option. We are certainly going to do our best to ensure that this does not happen, but we
are not able
to rule out such a worst case scenario entirely.</p>

<div>
<p>Das Auge. Es ist unser wichtigstes Sinnesorgan. </p>
<p>Was wäre es doch toll, wieder wie ein junger Mensch von nah bis fern perfekt
scharf sehen zu können –
ohne lästige Brillen.</p>
<p>Unter Alterssichtigkeit leidet spätestens jeder über 50. Viel schlimmer ist die
Linseneintrübung,
der Graue Star: Jeder 2. über 60 bekommt ihn, davon wird jeder 2. operiert. Bisher gibt es hierzu
keine zufriedenstellenden Lösungen, die natürliche, gesunde Sehfähigkeit zurückzuerlangen!</p>
<p>Genau daran arbeiten wir: Mit der neuen bioinspirierten Intraokularlinse „DeepSight“ von biolnic soll schon
bald scharfes Sehen
von nah bis fern ermöglicht werden! <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> imitiert die ungeheure
Weichheit und Elastizität der
gesunden, natürlichen Linse und verformt sich auch so wie diese.</p>
<p>Wir haben eine äußerst vielversprechende Lösung für die Probleme der
Alterssichtigkeit und des
Grauen Star in der Hand – <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> muss zur Marktreife entwickelt und
am Menschen erstmals klinisch erprobt
werden. Dies dauert etwa 2,5 Jahre. Hierfür brauchen wir Sie!</p>
<p>Ermöglichen Sie etwas Einzigartiges: Erwerben Sie jetzt eine übertragbare Option
auf ein Paar
<b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> mit 20%, 40% oder 90% Rabatt auf den anvisierten Marktpreis von $5.000 (4.000€),
die
Sie im Fall der Erlangung der
Marktfähigkeit einlösen können. Oder wir werden jede Ihrer Spenden im Erfolgsfall an gemeinnützige Stiftungen weiter geben, die helfen Blindheit zu vermeiden, zudem spenden wir ein Paar <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b>, jedes Mal, wenn biolnic über Ihre Spenden $500 eingenommen hat.</p>
<p>80% der Umwelteindrücke nehmen wir über das gesunde Auge wahr. Wir arbeiten
akribisch daran, unsere
Lebensqualität im Alter mit <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> entscheidend verbessern und
damit aktiver leben zu können.

<h2>Ein bisschen Medizin zuerst</h2>
<div>
<h4>Die natürliche Linse</h4>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://biolnic.eu/img/TE_DieNatuerlicheLinse.png"" src="""" style=""width: 65%; float: right; margin-left: 2%; margin-bottom: 2%;""/>
<p>Die Linse des menschlichen Auges ist ein kristallklarer, extrem elastischer Körper, der das durch
die
Pupille eintretende Licht auf der Netzhaut in ein scharfes Bild bündelt. Sie ist in einem
hauchdünnen
„Kapselsack“ gelagert, welcher über seitlich in den Äquator der Kapsel einstrahlende Zonula-
fasern am
ringförmigen Ziliarmuskel aufgehängt ist.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Der Graue Star und die Alterssichtigkeit</h4>
<div>
<p>Eine besonders gravierende und langsam fortschreitende Erkrankung ist der <b>Graue Star</b>
(„Katarakt“),
bei der es zur Trübung der Augenlinse kommt. Die Folgen sind eine erhöhte Blendempfindlichkeit
des
Auges und die verblasste Wahrnehmung von Farben. Der fortgeschrittene Graue Star kann nur
operativ
behandelt werden, indem die natürliche Linse nach Öffnung des Kapselsacks durch eine -
künstliche -
Intraokularlinse (IOL) ausgetauscht wird.
</p>
<b><b>
</b></b>
<p>Die <b>Alterssichtigkeit</b> („Presbyopie“) ist der altersbedingte Verlust der
Anpassungsfähigkeit
des Auges an unterschiedliche Gegenstandsweiten (Akkommodation). Im Wesentlichen beruht dies auf
einem Elastizitätsverlust des Linsenkerns. Die Korrektur erfolgt in der Regel mit einer oder
mehreren Brillen.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Die Akkommodation</h4>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://biolnic.eu/img/TE_Akkommodation_black.bmp.png"" src="""" style=""width: 45%; float: right; margin-left: 2%; margin-bottom: 2%;"" title=""Ist der Ziliarmuskel entspannt, straffen sich die Zonula und spannen den Kapselsack über seinen Äquator in radialer Richtung aus. Der Kapselsack übt dadurch eine axiale Druckkraft auf die Linse aus, wodurch diese sich in eine weniger gekrümmte Ellipse (Fernsicht) verformt. Ist der Ziliar konzentrisch verengt, sind die Zonulafasern schlaff und die Linse geht aufgrund ihrer Eigenelastizität in ihre kugelige Eigenform (Nahsicht) zurück.""/>
<p>Bei der Akkommodation, dem Scharfstellen des Auges, übt der ringförmige Muskel („Ziliar“) nicht,
wie
man annehmen könnte, eine Kraft auf die Linse aus. Stattdessen entspannen sich bei Kontraktion
des
Ziliar die Zonulafasern und die Linse stellt sich in ihre kugelige Eigenform für die Nahsicht
zurück. Magnetresonanztomographie (MRT)-Untersuchungen zeigen, dass die Durchmesseränderung des Ziliar bei der Akkommodation
sich nur relativ geringfügig zwischen jung zu alt unterscheidet und bei <a rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Streng et al. Magnetic resonance imaging of aging, accommodating, phakic, and pseudophakic ciliary muscle diameters. J Cataract Refract Surg. 32(11): 1792–1798."">etwa
0,6mm liegt</a>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Herkömmliche IOL’s</h4>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://biolnic.eu/img/TE_HerkoemmlicheIOLs.png"" src="""" style=""width: 30%; float: right; margin-left: 2%; margin-bottom: 2%;""/>
<p>Standard Intraokularlinsen (IOL’s) haben nur einen Fokus, womit man entweder nur nah oder fern
sehen
kann.
</p>
<p>Daneben gibt es Bifokal- bzw. Multifokallinsen mit mehreren Fokussen, die zwar wie die Standard
IOL’s
nicht völlig starr sind, jedoch nicht akkommodieren und ihre Form verändern können. Der Nachteil
der
Multifokallinsen liegt in dem deutlich schlechteren Kontrastsehvermögen und erhöhter
Blendempfindlichkeit (insbesondere bei Nacht). Ähnlich wie bei Gleitsichtbrillen ist zudem der
Sehbereich kleiner, welches ein unphysiologisches Schaukeln des Kopfes nach sich zieht.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Komplikationen von IOL’s</h4>
<div>
<p>Die häufigste Komplikation bei der Verwendung von Intraokularlinsen ist die Eintrübung der
Hinterkapsel,
der „Nachstar“. Dieser erfordert einen zusätzlichen operativen Eingriff mittels eines Lasers.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Akkommodierbare IOL’s</h4>
<div>
<p>Anders als vielfach angenommen kann die Akkommodation des Auges bislang nicht zufriedenstellend
wiederhergestellt werden! Es werden nur Brechkraftänderungen von etwa 1,5 Dioptrien erreicht;
für die
Nah- bis Fernsicht sind jedoch mindestens 3 Dioptrien nötig.
</p>
<p>Durchdachte biomechanische Lösungen fehlen, bei denen die Funktion des Scharfstellens möglichst
exakt der
Natur nachgeahmt wird. Und zwar ohne dass sich Auge oder Gehirn umstellen müssten oder es zu
(optischen)
Fehlleistungen kommen könnte und ohne elektronische Hilfsmittel!
</p>
<p><b>Weiteres Manko</b>: Der durch die Öffnung „beschädigte“ Kapselsack kann eine flexible IOL nur
sehr
eingeschränkt in ihren flachen Zustand für die Fernsicht zusammendrücken.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Neue Standards setzen</h4>
<div>
<p>Viel effizienter ist die Kraftübertragung, die hinter der Konstruktion und dem Design der <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> steckt! Hier soll die IOL direkt an den Ziliarmuskel
angekoppelt werden.</p>

bioinspirierten <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> schon bei weniger als der halben
Durchmesseränderung des Ziliar von nur 0,2mm ein mehrfaches an Brechkraftänderung als der
benötigten 3
Dioptrien für Nah- bis Fernsicht erzielt werden könnte. Dies soll in der klinischen Prüfung
belegt
werden.

<p>Die <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> soll sich ähnlich unkompliziert implantieren lassen
wie herkömmliche IOL’s, wobei dies nur etwa 10 min. dauert. Zur Implantation wird der Kapselsack entfernt oder hinter die
Intraokularlinse
verschoben. Die <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> wird in den Ziliarmuskel eingesetzt.
Sie
kann zudem am Ziliar oder dem Augapfel befestigt werden. Für den Implantationsvorgang wird die
Linse
flach gedrückt, die Füllung dadurch in einen angekoppelten Schlauch überführt und klein
aufgerollt.

<h2>Was die DeepSight einzigartig machen soll</h2>
<p>Die <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> besticht in der Summe der Details durch die Einfachheit des
Designs in Form eines
bioinspirierten Systems, welches der menschlichen Physiologie sehr nahekommt. Die Form der IOL verändert sich - als Maß für die Brechkraftänderung - sogar deutlich stärker als die der natürlichen Linse, von einem nahezu ebenen Fernzustand in einen sehr stark gekrümmten Nahzustand.</p>
<div>
<h4>Diese Alleinstellungsmerkmale sind unser Ziel</h4>
<ul>
<li>Natürliches, scharfes Sehen von 25 cm bis Fern ohne zusätzliche Sehhilfen,
Gesichtsfeldeinschränkung
und Umstellung von Auge oder Gehirn.
</li>
<li>
Die <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> soll die Muskelkontraktion maximal ausnutzen,
indem sie vollständig vom Ziliar
umschlossen wird und durch die Schlitze im Haptikring und dem flüssigen Kern äußerst verformbar
ist.
</li>
<li>Die sehr große Optik ermöglicht ein signifikant besseres Nachtsichtverhalten.</li>
<li>Der Nachstar oder eine Dezentrierung sind weit weniger wahrscheinlich.</li>
<li>Sie soll auch Patienten mit starker Fehlsichtigkeit helfen.</li>
<li>Langfristig niedrigere Kosten im Vergleich zu sonstigen Sehhilfen.</li>
<li>Patienten mit konventioneller IOL können sich diese durch eine DeepSight ersetzen lassen.</li>

<p>Das Design der IOL wurde für die Ankoppelung an den Ziliarmuskel entwickelt. Hierbei sind wir
bereits
durch einen langen Prozess gegangen, in dem vielzählige Designs der <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b>
mit aufwendigen

<h2>Herausforderungen die zu meistern sind</h2>
<h3>Große Ideen benötigen starke Strategien zur Verwirklichung</h3>
<div>
<p>Naturgemäß bestehen bei der Entwicklung von neuen Implantaten für den menschlichen Körper vielfältige
medizintechnische Risiken und Herausforderungen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Der Mikrospritzguss hochelastischer optischer Präzisionsbauteile und damit die Fertigung der
<b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> sind äußerst anspruchsvoll, aber mit unseren
kompetenten
Partnern aus dem COTECH-Projekt
umsetzbar.
</li>
<li>Die Akkommodation der <b style=""color: #132a64;"">DeepSight</b> muss sich im Rahmen der
klinischen Prüfungen am Menschen ausreichend
zeigen. Wir sind davon überzeugt, dass dies gelingt.
</li>
<li>Ferner hängt die präzise Auswahl der korrekten Größe der IOL für den Ziliarmuskel von der
Sorgfalt
des Arztes und geeigneter bildgebender Verfahren ab. Präzision und Sorgfalt sind Augenärzte
jedoch
gewöhnt.
</li>
<li>Das Langzeitverhalten von Implantaten lässt sich generell nie im Voraus 100%ig zuverlässig
bewerten.
Es sollte jedoch so sein wie bei herkömmlichen IOL’s.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Gewiss soll hier auch darauf hingewiesen werden, dass es bei solchen Projekten vorkommen kann, dass
Entwicklungsschritte, Tests oder sogar klinische Prüfungen wiederholt werden müssen. Dies kann im
schlimmsten Fall bis zum Scheitern der Unternehmung infolge der Nichterreichung der
Verkehrsfähigkeit der
Linsen als Medizinprodukte führen, wodurch Ihre Option verloren gehen würde. Wir werden aber
selbstverständlich unser Bestes tun, dass dies nicht eintritt, können ein solches worst-case

At a glance - Seeing like a young person again


The eye. It is our most important sensory organ.


Wouldn't it be great to see perfectly sharply from near to far like a young person again without the
annoying
glasses.
By the age of 50, everyone is suffering from presbyopia. Opacification of the lens – cataracts – are even
worse: one in two people over 60 gets them, and a further one in two of these are operated on. There are
still no satisfactory solutions to restore natural, healthy eyesight.
This is exactly what we are working on: the new bio-inspired intraocular lens „DeepSight“ by biolnic should soon enable sharp near vision and far vision. DeepSight imitates the
incredible softness and elasticity of a healthy, natural lens and also deforms just like one. It's like inventing the fountain of youth for your eyes.
We have a highly promising solution for the problems of presbyopia and cataracts – DeepSight must be
developed to a marketable stage and a first clinical trial on humans must be carried out. This will take about 2,5 years. For this we need
you!
Make something unique possible: purchase a transferable option on a pair of DeepSight
lenses now with a 20%, 40% or 90% discount on the intended market price of $5,000 (4,000€), which you can redeem after achieving
marketability. Or we will pass every of your donations to charitable foundations who help prevent blindness, and in addition, we will donate a pair of DeepSight every time biolnic raises $500 via your donations, if the project will succeed.
We get 80% of our impressions from healthy eyes. We are working meticulously on
significantly improving our quality of life in old age with DeepSight
so that we can live more actively.
Please support us in doing so, here or soon on biolnic.com.

A little bit of medicine first of all

The natural lens 


The lens of the human eye is a crystal-clear, extremely elastic body which bundles the light
that enters
via the pupil onto the retina to create a sharp picture. It is embedded in a wafer-thin
“capsular sac”
which is attached to the ring-formed ciliary muscle by zonula fibers, which radiate
laterally into the
equator of the capsule.



Cataracts and presbyopia
A particularly serious and slowly progressive disease is cataracts, in which the lenses of
the eye become
opaque, resulting in increased glare sensitivity of the eye and faded perception of colors.
Advanced
cataracts can only be treated through surgery to replace the natural lens with an artificial
intraocular
lens (IOL) after opening of the capsular sac.

Presbyopia is the age-related loss of the adaptability of the eye to different object
distances
(accommodation). This is essentially based on the loss of elasticity in the lens core. This is
normally
corrected using one or more pairs of glasses.



Accommodation


In accommodation - the focusing of the eye - the ring-shaped muscle (“ciliar”) does not exert
any force
on the lens as you would assume. Instead, the zonula fibers relax in the event of
contraction of the
ciliary muscle and the lens switches into its natural spherical shape for near vision. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
examinations
show that the changes in diameter during accommodation of the ciliary muscle are only
slightly different
for young people and old people, at approximately
0.6 mm.




Conventional IOLs


Standard intraocular lenses (IOLs) have only one focus and provide either near or far vision.

There are also bifocal or multifocal lenses with more than one focus which are not completely
rigid like
the standard IOLs but, however, are unable to accommodate and to change their shape. The
disadvantage of
multifocal lenses is the significantly worse contrast vision and increased glare sensitivity
(particularly at night). In a similar manner to varifocal glasses, the field of vision is
narrower which
results in a non-physiological rocking of the head.




Complications of IOLs
The most frequent complication arising from the use of intraocular lenses is the opacification of
the
posterior capsule (post-cataract occurrences). This requires additional laser surgery.



Accommodable IOLs

Contrary to what is widely assumed, the accommodation of the eye is not yet able to be
returned to a
satisfactory state. Only refractive power changes of about 1.5 diopter can be achieved, but
at least
3 diopter are needed for near and far vision.

There is a lack of sophisticated biomechanical solutions in which the function of focusing
imitates the
nature function as closely as possible. And this needs to be without the eye or brain having
to shift,
without (optical) mistakes and without electronic aids!

Another shortcoming: the capsular sac “damaged” by opening can compress a flexible IOL
into its
flat condition for far vision only to a very limited extent.




Setting new standards

The power transmission that is behind construction and design of the DeepSight is much more efficient. In this,
the IOL is to be
connected to the ciliary muscle directly.

How “DeepSight” works
Looking into nature’s soul





How it should work



The lens-shaped DeepSight is flat in its distance condition,
just
like its natural model. It consists of a thin, extremely elastic shell and a liquid, highly
refractive
core. The ciliary muscle nestles itself around the “haptic ring”, the edge of the IOL. This
one can
follow the contraction of the ciliary muscle due to the thin slits. The DeepSight get rounder: near objects become sharp!








Our simulations (optical as well as stress and deformation analyses) show that with the
bio-inspired
DeepSight a multiple of refractive power change than the
necessary 3 diopter for near to distant vision can be achieved already with less than a
half
diameter change of the ciliar. This has still to be proven in the clinical trial.





How DeepSight should
be implanted



The DeepSight should be implanted in a similarly
uncomplicated
way like conventional IOLs, which can be performed in as little as 10 minutes. For implantation, the capsular sac is removed or shifted
behind the
intraocular lens. The DeepSight is inserted into the
ciliary muscle. In addition
it can be fixed to the ciliary muscle or eyeball. During implantation, the lens is
pressed flat so
the filling is transferred to a connected tube which is rolled up into a small shape.




Content


What will make DeepSight unique
DeepSight stands out in all of its details by the simplicity of the
design
in the form of a bio-inspired system which is very close to human physiology. The change in shape of the IOL as an indicator for the accommodation capacity is even much higher than that of the natural lens ie from an almost flat far vision state to a highly curved near vision state.

These unique selling propositions are our objective

Natural, sharp vision from approximately 25 cm to a distance without further visual aids,
restriction
of the visual field and an adjustment of the eye or brain.


DeepSight aims to make the most possible use of the muscle
contraction by being fully enclosed by the ciliary muscle and by being extremely deformable
due to the
slits in the haptic ring and liquid core.

The very large optics provides significantly improved night vision.
The post-cataract occurrences or a decentration are far less likely.
It also aims to help patients suffering from very poor vision.
Lower costs in the long term compared to other visual aids.
Patients with conventional IOLs can replace them with DeepSight.

Who is behind DeepSight
We’re a team of biomedical and scientific experts who get their kicks from using tech to make people
fall in
love with our lenses




We, Andreas, Ben and Josef know each other from the COTECH Project supported by the European Union
(www.fp7-cotech.eu).


Dr. Josef Jansen is the founder of biolnic and head of DeepSight.
As a mechanical engineer (having written his dissertation/PhD on artificial heart valves), for
the last 30
years he has been working on the development of implants for the human body which imitate
nature. His core
skill is the analysis and understanding of the mechanism of action of body parts which are put
under a
large amount of stress and their technical and constructive implementation in a physiological
biomechanical
design with elasticity close to that found in nature. Josef combines the highest technical
requirements with
the simplicity of natural solutions. Visionary and innovative product development is his
passion. And this
frequently comes from small, innovative companies which often achieve more skill, flexibility
and continuity
in this special field.



Dr. Andreas Schoth is physicist and engineer and a scientific expert in the field of
microsystem
technology. He has been working in this innovative field since he wrote his dissertation (PhD)
on quantum
mechanical silicon sensors in 1995. Freely adapted from Richard Feynman’s ""There is Plenty of
Room at the
Bottom"", Andreas researches and develops manufacturing technologies for different applications;
from “lab on
the chip” to highly miniaturized implants. This also includes, for example, micro and nano
injection molding
of smart materials.



Dr. Ben Whiteside has been pushing the boundaries of ultra-high precision injection
molding since
2001. His background includes a PhD study of the mechanical properties of polymer composite
materials and
over ten years as a researcher and lecturer studying computer modelling of polymer processes,
process data
acquisition of polymer manufacturing systems, high speed imaging and visualization technique
development and
manufacturing of polymer components with micro and nano-scale precision. Ben is now Director of
the Centre
for Micro and Nano Molding at the University of Bradford, which is a unique facility worldwide
for the
manufacture of nano-precision devices using a wide range of materials.

The work we do



We go to painstaking lengths to ensure that no stone is left unturned in our quest for the best way
forward to
an accommodative IOL

Where we stand


The design of the IOL was developed for attachment to the ciliary muscle. We have therefore
already been
through a long process in which numerous designs of the DeepSight
were simulated using complex calculation programs. In addition, it was also possible to
manufacture a
prototype of an extremely complex shaped IOL intended for implantation in the capsular sac
using
state-of-the-art micro technologies – with a partner from Bradford in the European COTECH
Project (www.fp7-cotech.eu).




What has to be done



A great deal of work is still in front of us. The micro precision manufacturing technology
and the
design of DeepSight are further optimized in terms of the
plastics
used and tailored to one another. Various different examinations and tests are being carried
out.
Initial pre-production models of the DeepSight are being
examined
in a clinical pilot investigation with 10 patients in which accommodation ability of the IOL
is being
demonstrated over a period of six months (until mid-2017). Therefore biolnic needs
approximately $2.1 (1.7€) million. And that’s why we need you!

The subsequent, extensive clinical trial with approximately 400 patients should last for
around two
years. In parallel, automated series production will be established. This can be covered by
EU financing
programs. Marketability of the DeepSight lens as medical
product
for the European region should then be achieved and the sale by industry partners can begin.




Series production – quality knows no compromises

The series production of DeepSight is likely to be carried out by
biolnic itself and built up together with the partners. 

This is because the highest possible quality standards are always at the forefront!

Our awesome partners
Close cooperation with excellent partners enables us to do world-class work
For the micro production technologies, biolnic is cooperating with competent partners from the COTECH
EU
project.

The COTECH project


biolnic is continuing the developments in accommodable intraocular lenses made by the company be
innovative
on the basis of the COTECH (2008-2012: „Converging technologies for micro systems
manufacturing“, www.fp7-cotech.eu) project supported by the
European Union. Completely new
micro production technologies were developed by 25 European partners in COTECH. The
“demonstrator” created
by be innovative was an accommodable IOL which can be implanted in the capsular sac with
deformable optics.
The IOL was made of two differently shaped, aspherical half shells which were then assembled.








The Centre for Polymer Micro and Nano Technology at the University of Bradford (UK) has
been
internationally recognized for its pioneering research in the field of micro injection molding
since 2001.
It has an extensive range of cutting edge processing hardware specifically designed for the
industrial-scale
manufacture of micro and nano precision components. They have developed bespoke systems for
monitoring the
behavior of the raw material and the equipment dynamics in production processes. Further novel
sensor
technologies and data acquisition systems enable full traceability of the production environment
for product
manufacture – particularly relevant for the medical device sector. In addition, the Centre has a
dedicated
characterization laboratory (e.g. for assessing the shape and mechanical properties of micro
injection
molded components and surface features). A highly skilled team provides the expertise for
developing new
processes and technologies to overcome the significant challenges required for the manufacture
of
state-of-the-art devices.








The Department of Microsystems Engineering (IMTEK) at the University of Freiburg
(Germany) is an
internationally leading institute in the field of life sciences, brain computers interface and
micro/nanotechnology. IMTEK has detailed knowledge and experience in the field of plastic
molding with sub
micrometer precision and in the production of high-precision injection molded shapes and
embossing dies with
optical surfaces.








The Department of Experimental Ophthalmology (Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Dr. med. Solon Thanos)
is a
recognized research institution at the University of Münster (Germany). The working group
dominates the
field of clinical and experimental ophthalmology, biocompatibility studies, in vitro cultures of
nerve, lens
and corneal cells are routinely carried out.

Challenges to be mastered
Great ideas need robust strategies to turn them into reality

Needless to say, many medical technology risks and challenges arise during the development of new
implants
for the human body: 

The micro injection molding of highly elastic precision components and thus production of DeepSight are extremely demanding but can be realized with
our
competent partners from the COTECH project.

The accommodation of DeepSight must be adequately shown
within
the scope of the clinical trials on humans.

Furthermore, the precise selection of the correct size of IOL for the ciliary muscle depends
on the
care of the physician and suitable imaging procedures. Ophthalmologists, however, are used
to precision
and care.

Generally, the long-term behavior of implants cannot be assessed 100% reliably in advance.
But it
should be the same as for the conventional IOL.


It certainly should also be pointed out here that it is possible that in such projects
development steps,
tests or even clinical trials may need to be repeated. This can result in the failure of the
enterprise in
the worst case due to not reaching marketability of the lenses as a medical product and
therefore a loss of
the option. We are certainly going to do our best to ensure that this does not happen, but we
are not able
to rule out such a worst case scenario entirely.

Auf einen Blick - Wieder sehen können wie ein junger Mensch


Das Auge. Es ist unser wichtigstes Sinnesorgan. 
Was wäre es doch toll, wieder wie ein junger Mensch von nah bis fern perfekt
scharf sehen zu können –
ohne lästige Brillen.
Unter Alterssichtigkeit leidet spätestens jeder über 50. Viel schlimmer ist die
Linseneintrübung,
der Graue Star: Jeder 2. über 60 bekommt ihn, davon wird jeder 2. operiert. Bisher gibt es hierzu
keine zufriedenstellenden Lösungen, die natürliche, gesunde Sehfähigkeit zurückzuerlangen!
Genau daran arbeiten wir: Mit der neuen bioinspirierten Intraokularlinse „DeepSight“ von biolnic soll schon
bald scharfes Sehen
von nah bis fern ermöglicht werden! DeepSight imitiert die ungeheure
Weichheit und Elastizität der
gesunden, natürlichen Linse und verformt sich auch so wie diese.
Wir haben eine äußerst vielversprechende Lösung für die Probleme der
Alterssichtigkeit und des
Grauen Star in der Hand – DeepSight muss zur Marktreife entwickelt und
am Menschen erstmals klinisch erprobt
werden. Dies dauert etwa 2,5 Jahre. Hierfür brauchen wir Sie!
Ermöglichen Sie etwas Einzigartiges: Erwerben Sie jetzt eine übertragbare Option
auf ein Paar
DeepSight mit 20%, 40% oder 90% Rabatt auf den anvisierten Marktpreis von $5.000 (4.000€),
die
Sie im Fall der Erlangung der
Marktfähigkeit einlösen können. Oder wir werden jede Ihrer Spenden im Erfolgsfall an gemeinnützige Stiftungen weiter geben, die helfen Blindheit zu vermeiden, zudem spenden wir ein Paar DeepSight, jedes Mal, wenn biolnic über Ihre Spenden $500 eingenommen hat.
80% der Umwelteindrücke nehmen wir über das gesunde Auge wahr. Wir arbeiten
akribisch daran, unsere
Lebensqualität im Alter mit DeepSight entscheidend verbessern und
damit aktiver leben zu können.

Synopse


Häufig gestellte Fragen


Zum Anfang



Ein bisschen Medizin zuerst

Die natürliche Linse


Die Linse des menschlichen Auges ist ein kristallklarer, extrem elastischer Körper, der das durch
die
Pupille eintretende Licht auf der Netzhaut in ein scharfes Bild bündelt. Sie ist in einem
hauchdünnen
„Kapselsack“ gelagert, welcher über seitlich in den Äquator der Kapsel einstrahlende Zonula-
fasern am
ringförmigen Ziliarmuskel aufgehängt ist.



Der Graue Star und die Alterssichtigkeit

Eine besonders gravierende und langsam fortschreitende Erkrankung ist der Graue Star
(„Katarakt“),
bei der es zur Trübung der Augenlinse kommt. Die Folgen sind eine erhöhte Blendempfindlichkeit
des
Auges und die verblasste Wahrnehmung von Farben. Der fortgeschrittene Graue Star kann nur
operativ
behandelt werden, indem die natürliche Linse nach Öffnung des Kapselsacks durch eine -
künstliche -
Intraokularlinse (IOL) ausgetauscht wird.



Die Alterssichtigkeit („Presbyopie“) ist der altersbedingte Verlust der
Anpassungsfähigkeit
des Auges an unterschiedliche Gegenstandsweiten (Akkommodation). Im Wesentlichen beruht dies auf
einem Elastizitätsverlust des Linsenkerns. Die Korrektur erfolgt in der Regel mit einer oder
mehreren Brillen.




Die Akkommodation


Bei der Akkommodation, dem Scharfstellen des Auges, übt der ringförmige Muskel („Ziliar“) nicht,
wie
man annehmen könnte, eine Kraft auf die Linse aus. Stattdessen entspannen sich bei Kontraktion
des
Ziliar die Zonulafasern und die Linse stellt sich in ihre kugelige Eigenform für die Nahsicht
zurück. Magnetresonanztomographie (MRT)-Untersuchungen zeigen, dass die Durchmesseränderung des Ziliar bei der Akkommodation
sich nur relativ geringfügig zwischen jung zu alt unterscheidet und bei etwa
0,6mm liegt.




Herkömmliche IOL’s


Standard Intraokularlinsen (IOL’s) haben nur einen Fokus, womit man entweder nur nah oder fern
sehen
kann.

Daneben gibt es Bifokal- bzw. Multifokallinsen mit mehreren Fokussen, die zwar wie die Standard
IOL’s
nicht völlig starr sind, jedoch nicht akkommodieren und ihre Form verändern können. Der Nachteil
der
Multifokallinsen liegt in dem deutlich schlechteren Kontrastsehvermögen und erhöhter
Blendempfindlichkeit (insbesondere bei Nacht). Ähnlich wie bei Gleitsichtbrillen ist zudem der
Sehbereich kleiner, welches ein unphysiologisches Schaukeln des Kopfes nach sich zieht.




Komplikationen von IOL’s

Die häufigste Komplikation bei der Verwendung von Intraokularlinsen ist die Eintrübung der
Hinterkapsel,
der „Nachstar“. Dieser erfordert einen zusätzlichen operativen Eingriff mittels eines Lasers.




Akkommodierbare IOL’s

Anders als vielfach angenommen kann die Akkommodation des Auges bislang nicht zufriedenstellend
wiederhergestellt werden! Es werden nur Brechkraftänderungen von etwa 1,5 Dioptrien erreicht;
für die
Nah- bis Fernsicht sind jedoch mindestens 3 Dioptrien nötig.

Durchdachte biomechanische Lösungen fehlen, bei denen die Funktion des Scharfstellens möglichst
exakt der
Natur nachgeahmt wird. Und zwar ohne dass sich Auge oder Gehirn umstellen müssten oder es zu
(optischen)
Fehlleistungen kommen könnte und ohne elektronische Hilfsmittel!

Weiteres Manko: Der durch die Öffnung „beschädigte“ Kapselsack kann eine flexible IOL nur
sehr
eingeschränkt in ihren flachen Zustand für die Fernsicht zusammendrücken.




Neue Standards setzen

Viel effizienter ist die Kraftübertragung, die hinter der Konstruktion und dem Design der DeepSight steckt! Hier soll die IOL direkt an den Ziliarmuskel
angekoppelt werden.


Inhaltsverzeichnis



Wie die „DeepSight“ funktioniert
Der Natur in die Seele geschaut




Wie sie funktionieren soll


Die linsenförmige DeepSight ist wie ihr natürliches Vorbild im
Fernzustand flach. Sie besteht aus einer dünnen, äußerst elastischen Schale mit einem flüssigen,
hoch-lichtbrechenden Kern. Der Ziliarmuskel schmiegt sich um den „Haptikring“, den Rand der IOL.
Dieser
kann aufgrund der dünnen Schlitze der Kontraktion des Ziliar folgen. Die DeepSight wird runder: nahe Objekte werden scharf
abgebildet!






Unsere Simulationen (optische sowie Spannungs- und Verformungsanalysen) zeigen, dass mit der
bioinspirierten DeepSight schon bei weniger als der halben
Durchmesseränderung des Ziliar von nur 0,2mm ein mehrfaches an Brechkraftänderung als der
benötigten 3
Dioptrien für Nah- bis Fernsicht erzielt werden könnte. Dies soll in der klinischen Prüfung
belegt
werden.




Wie die DeepSight implantiert werden soll


Die DeepSight soll sich ähnlich unkompliziert implantieren lassen
wie herkömmliche IOL’s, wobei dies nur etwa 10 min. dauert. Zur Implantation wird der Kapselsack entfernt oder hinter die
Intraokularlinse
verschoben. Die DeepSight wird in den Ziliarmuskel eingesetzt.
Sie
kann zudem am Ziliar oder dem Augapfel befestigt werden. Für den Implantationsvorgang wird die
Linse
flach gedrückt, die Füllung dadurch in einen angekoppelten Schlauch überführt und klein
aufgerollt.



Inhaltsverzeichnis


Was die DeepSight einzigartig machen soll
Die DeepSight besticht in der Summe der Details durch die Einfachheit des
Designs in Form eines
bioinspirierten Systems, welches der menschlichen Physiologie sehr nahekommt. Die Form der IOL verändert sich - als Maß für die Brechkraftänderung - sogar deutlich stärker als die der natürlichen Linse, von einem nahezu ebenen Fernzustand in einen sehr stark gekrümmten Nahzustand.

Diese Alleinstellungsmerkmale sind unser Ziel

Natürliches, scharfes Sehen von 25 cm bis Fern ohne zusätzliche Sehhilfen,
Gesichtsfeldeinschränkung
und Umstellung von Auge oder Gehirn.


Die DeepSight soll die Muskelkontraktion maximal ausnutzen,
indem sie vollständig vom Ziliar
umschlossen wird und durch die Schlitze im Haptikring und dem flüssigen Kern äußerst verformbar
ist.

Die sehr große Optik ermöglicht ein signifikant besseres Nachtsichtverhalten.
Der Nachstar oder eine Dezentrierung sind weit weniger wahrscheinlich.
Sie soll auch Patienten mit starker Fehlsichtigkeit helfen.
Langfristig niedrigere Kosten im Vergleich zu sonstigen Sehhilfen.
Patienten mit konventioneller IOL können sich diese durch eine DeepSight ersetzen lassen.




Wer hinter DeepSight steht
Wir sind ein Team aus biomedizinischen und wissenschaftlichen Experten, deren Kick darin liegt,
Technologien zu
nutzen, dass Menschen sich in unsere Linsen verlieben




Wir, Andreas, Ben und Josef kennen uns aus dem von der Europäischen Union geförderten Projekt COTECH (www.fp7-cotech.eu).


Dr. Josef Jansen ist der Gründer der biolnic und Kopf der DeepSight. Als Maschinenbau-
ingenieur
(Dissertation
über künstliche Herzklappen) beschäftigt er sich seit 30 Jahren mit der Entwicklung von der Natur
nachgeahmten Implantaten für den menschlichen Körper. Seine Kernkompetenz liegt in der Analyse und
dem
Verständnis der Wirkungsweise von hochbeanspruchten Körperteilen und deren technisch-konstruktiver
Umsetzung
in ein physiologiegerechtes, biomechanisches Design mit naturnaher Elastizität. Josef verbindet
höchste
technische Ansprüche mit der Einfachheit von Lösungen aus der Natur. Visionäre und innovative
Produktentwicklungen sind seine Leidenschaft. Und diese kommen häufig aus kleinen, innovativen
Unternehmen,
die in diesem Spezialbereich oft mehr Kompetenz, Flexibilität und Kontinuität gewährleisten.




Dr. Andreas Schoth ist Physiker und Ingenieur und der wissenschaftliche Experte auf dem Gebiet
der
Mikrosystemtechnik. Er ist seit seiner Dissertation über quantenmechanische Siliziumsensoren im
Jahre 1995
in diesem innovativen Gebiet zu Hause. Frei nach Richard Feynmans ""There is Plenty of Room at the
Bottom""
(Ganz unten ist eine Menge Platz), erforscht und entwickelt Andreas Fertigungstechnologien für
unterschiedliche Anwendungen; vom „Lab on the Chip“ zu hochminiaturisierten Implantaten. Dazu gehört
auch
als ein Beispiel, dass Mikro-und Nanospritzgiessen von smarten Materialien.




Dr. Ben Whiteside überwindet seit 2001 immer wieder die Grenzen des
Ultrapräzisionsspritzgusses. Die
mechanischen Eigenschaften von Polymerverbundstoffen war Thema seiner Dissertation. Danach

Prozessdatenerfassung von Polymerfertigungssystemen, Hochgeschwindigkeitsbilderfassung und der
Entwicklung
von Visualisierungstechnik ebenso wie mit der Fertigung von Polymerkomponenten im Mikro- und
Nanobereich.
Zurzeit ist Ben Direktor am Centre for Micro and Nano Moulding an der Universität Bradford, das sich
als
weltweit einzigartige Einrichtung mit der Fertigung von Nanopräzisionsinstrumenten aus einer breiten

Arbeit die wir machen



Wir scheuen keine Mühen, um sicher zu stellen, dass nichts unversucht bleibt auf unserer Suche nach dem
besten
Weg für eine akkommodative IOL

Wo wir stehen


Das Design der IOL wurde für die Ankoppelung an den Ziliarmuskel entwickelt. Hierbei sind wir
bereits
durch einen langen Prozess gegangen, in dem vielzählige Designs der DeepSight
mit aufwendigen
Berechnungsprogrammen simuliert wurden. Zudem konnte ein Prototyp einer für die Implantation in
den
Kapselsack vorgesehenen, äußerst komplex geformten IOL mit modernsten Mikrotechnologien
gefertigt werden
- mit einem Partner aus Bradford in dem europäischen Projekt COTECH (www.fp7-cotech.eu).




Was zu tun ist



Viel Arbeit steht noch vor uns. Die Mikropräzisionsfertigungs- technik sowie das Design der
DeepSight
werden hinsichtlich des Kunststoffs weiter optimiert und aufeinander abgestimmt. Verschiedenste
Prüfungen und Tests werden durchgeführt. Erste Vorserienmodelle der DeepSight
werden dann in einer
„klinischen Pilotstudie“ an 10 Patienten untersucht, in der die Akkommodationsfähigkeit der IOL
über
ein halbes Jahr aufgezeigt wird (bis Mitte 2017). Hierfür benötigt biolnic rund $2.1 Mio. (1,7€
Mio.). Und
dafür
brauchen wir Sie!

Die anschließende, umfassende klinische Prüfung an etwa 400 Patienten soll rund 2 Jahre dauern.
Parallel
wird die automatisierte Serienfertigung aufgebaut. Dies kann über Finanzierungsprogramme der EU
gedeckt
werden. Danach soll die „Verkehrsfähigkeit“ der DeepSight Linse
als
Medizinprodukt in der
Europäischen
Union erreicht werden und der Verkauf über Partner aus der Industrie beginnen.



Die Serienfertigung – Qualität kennt keine
Kompromisse


Die Serien-Fertigung der DeepSight wird biolnic voraussichtlich
selbst vornehmen und zusammen mit den
Partnern aufbauen.

Denn: Absolut höchste Qualitätsmaßstäbe stehen immer im Vordergrund!

Herausforderungen die zu meistern sind
Große Ideen benötigen starke Strategien zur Verwirklichung

Naturgemäß bestehen bei der Entwicklung von neuen Implantaten für den menschlichen Körper vielfältige
medizintechnische Risiken und Herausforderungen:

Der Mikrospritzguss hochelastischer optischer Präzisionsbauteile und damit die Fertigung der
DeepSight sind äußerst anspruchsvoll, aber mit unseren
kompetenten
Partnern aus dem COTECH-Projekt
umsetzbar.

Die Akkommodation der DeepSight muss sich im Rahmen der
klinischen Prüfungen am Menschen ausreichend
zeigen. Wir sind davon überzeugt, dass dies gelingt.

Ferner hängt die präzise Auswahl der korrekten Größe der IOL für den Ziliarmuskel von der
Sorgfalt
des Arztes und geeigneter bildgebender Verfahren ab. Präzision und Sorgfalt sind Augenärzte
jedoch
gewöhnt.

Das Langzeitverhalten von Implantaten lässt sich generell nie im Voraus 100%ig zuverlässig
bewerten.
Es sollte jedoch so sein wie bei herkömmlichen IOL’s.


Gewiss soll hier auch darauf hingewiesen werden, dass es bei solchen Projekten vorkommen kann, dass
Entwicklungsschritte, Tests oder sogar klinische Prüfungen wiederholt werden müssen. Dies kann im
schlimmsten Fall bis zum Scheitern der Unternehmung infolge der Nichterreichung der
Verkehrsfähigkeit der
Linsen als Medizinprodukte führen, wodurch Ihre Option verloren gehen würde. Wir werden aber
selbstverständlich unser Bestes tun, dass dies nicht eintritt, können ein solches worst-case
Szenario jedoch
keinesfalls sicher ausschließen.

Entwicklungsvorhaben, in dem die Verkehrsfähigkeit der DeepSight erlangt werden soll. Einen Erfolg
können wir aber nicht garantieren. Für den Fall also, dass uns dies trotz aller gemeinsamen
Anstrengungen nicht gelingen sollte, muss die Option leider verfallen. Erwerber außerhalb der EU
sind selbst für die Entrichtung einer Mehrwertsteuer verantwortlich (siehe FAQ).

This in itself is exciting, but lets take a look at what Peter Diamandis had to say about the future of entrepreneurship and the changes to come: <div>
<br/><div>""The ability to build a business has gotten easier and cheaper. And the ability to create a product or service and quickly scale it to a million--or a billion--consumers is something that's possible today that wasn't possible even a decade ago. Today, entrepreneurs have access to technologies that were once available only to large organizations or governments. Plus, entrepreneurs now have access to a huge amount of capital--from VCs and the angel community as well as crowdfunding, which is expected to reach $15 billion in 2015. I think we're going to see an explosion in entrepreneurship, an explosion in innovation. That, to me, is why this next decade is extraordinarily exciting."" Peter Diamandis via Inc. <a href=""http://www.inc.com/magazine/201412/diana-ransom-and-liz-welch/going-full-tilt-entrepreneurship-peter-diamandis.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.inc.com/magazine/201412/diana-ransom-and-liz-welch/going-full-tilt-entrepreneurship-peter-diamandis.html </a><div><br/></div>
<div>We have created Assist 2 Develop to help the entrepreneurs, freelancers, and small businesses who manufacture products to create the explosion in innovation that Peter is speaking of.<br/><div><div><div>
<br/><p><b>Assist 2 Develop</b> is a freelance marketplace dedicated to engineering &amp; manufacturing and we are excited to revolutionize the way amazing products come to life. Many of the innovative products you use everyday &amp; see on INDIEGOGO are created because of the amazing people who create &amp; shape the world we live in. They are known as engineers, manufacturing professionals, disruptors, makers, &amp; innovators. Small businesses &amp; entrepreneurs creating physical products rely on these people to design &amp; manufacture the innovative products we all love &amp; below you will see that our economy does too. We have created Assist 2 Develop to help these parties to connect, collaborate in real time, and create innovative products. </p>
<div>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>What is The Inspiration Behind Your Product?</b> </p>
<p>What inspired me to create A2D (Assist 2 Develop) was seeing how the economic collapse in 2008 pushed more and more talented engineers to pick up freelance work out of necessity. Multi national company lay offs, offshoring product development / manufacturing, and in some cases maintaining corporate profits lead to the loss of jobs and this need for something different. Local economies were devastated and to understand why we can turn to the Bureau of economic analysis which has said that manufacturing has a larger multiplier effect than any other major economic activity. $1 spent in manufacturing generates $1.35 in additional economic activity. <a href=""http://manufacturing.gov/mfg_in_context.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://manufacturing.gov/mfg_in_context.html</a> So I created Assist 2 Develop to help reinvigorate local economies by bringing freelance engineering &amp; manufacturing professionals together with small businesses to create and manufacture the innovative products we all love and use every day. </p>

</p>
<p><b>What Problem Does Your Product Solve?</b> </p>
<p>According to a report published in HBR 75% of freelance work still comes via word of mouth <a href=""http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/10/the-freelance-economy-still-runs-on-word-of-mouth/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/10/the-freelance-economy-still-runs-on-word-of-mouth/</a> and the independent worker or freelancer category is growing faster than the overall labor force. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1061183/files/20141201090152-wordofmouthstill.png?1417453312"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>But we all know that engineers aren’t the most social people in the world (worked with them for 7+ years), so almost all of their work comes from word of mouth. In the evolving digital world can freelance engineers find enough sustainable work to live comfortably?  On the flip side entrepreneurs and small businesses have utilized freelancers to create their products more often since 2008 because it’s more cost effective, but how do they find the right person for the job? Too often small businesses and entrepreneurs waste time and money contracting a freelancer who didn't exactly deliver, so they end up having to rework entire design. And once the parties do connect the next big challenge is communication breakdowns, because that causes delays, and in today’s competitive global economy any delay can be very detrimental to your products success. Most communication between freelancers and small businesses happens via email and phone which doesn't foster a innovative and collaborative process. </p>

<p><b>How Does Your Product Solve This Problem &amp; Make a Positive Impact?</b></p>
<p>A2D is a freelance marketplace that helps bring the necessary parties together and allows them to collaborate in real time.

<p>The technologies involved are just an implementation detail. KVM and OpenVZ run virtual machines, whereas libvirt is an abstraction layer to these two.

<p>We didn't forget about regular users without bare metal servers. VirtKick ships with optional e-commerce features, so VPS providers can use them to sell machines.

<p>There will be a testing deployment of VirtKick. We'll grant access to every $25+ backer. There won't be any specific releases - the development will be continuous. A new version will be deployed any time the automated tests pass,</p>
<p>Our $99+ backers will get exclusive access to pre-releases of Linux packages and virtual appliances. They will go public after one month. Still, package sources will be public at all times. 100% open source - remember.</p>

<p>A lot of real code is already written and <a href=""https://github.com/virtkick"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">published on GitHub</a>.

<p>Technically, it's a server-side generated Rails web-application with some alive parts in AngularJS. On the backend there's WebVirtMgr that acts as a RESTful proxy to libvirt (we'll later replace it with Fog.io). Background tasks are ran with Delayed::Job, though we might switch do Sidekiq in future (it's no effort thanks to ActiveJob abstraction introduced in Rails 4.2 beta). Instead of relying on Apache or nginx, we make use of http-master, a web server implemented in node.js. It's also used to serve VNC on websockets (Websockify and noVNC are involved).</p>
<p>One-click install &amp; auto-configuration is one of our core features. At the moment, we almost achieved it on desktop environments, where the local machine is the hypervisor. All you need is to execute <a href=""https://github.com/virtkick/virtkick-starter"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">virtkick-start</a> command and type your password when asked for sudo. But we don't mess with your OS very much - we only create a new user, install a few packages and configure libvirt. Crucial parts of VirtKick we depend on are either installed in the system (Python) or in VirtKick directory (Ruby from RVM, Node.js from NVM). After you open VirtKick in your browser, we create a network, initialize storage pools and download ISO images of most popular Linux distros. VirtKick doesn't run as root.</p>
<p>Additionally, we've got a static prototype with most planned features. The user interface is already prototyped and designed. Click through the application yourself at <a href=""https://demo.virtkick.io/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">demo.virtkick.io</a> and get familiar with all planned features.</p>

</div></div>","VirtKick wraps awkard virtualization technology in a convenient, usable panel. VirtKick does to open source what DigitalOcean did to SaaS. Simplicity and privacy are our core goals. We're currently alpha and the code is on GitHub.VPS providers can read your data without you noticing that. Disk encryption won't help, since the key is stored in memory and they can read it as well. VirtKick lets you take cloud back and become your own VPS provider.





Data center is probably the best place for VirtKick. Dedicated servers are very reliable and cost-effective. They also offer an acceptable level of privacy as long as you encrypt your disks and type your passphrase on boot.



Sure dedicated servers won't protect you from server implants. Police could also hot replug and take your server to their lab to retrieve the encryption key from the memory. Install VirtKick on your computer or home server to get the highest level of privacy. It's no longer a cloud, but it's all yours and secure.




Imagine you don't need any previous knowledge to play with virtualization on your desktop or real servers. That's what VirtKick is all about. All the required components are already bundled, or automatically installed in your system. VirtKick requires little knowledge to start - you're just one click ahead!






The technologies involved are just an implementation detail. KVM and OpenVZ run virtual machines, whereas libvirt is an abstraction layer to these two. Docker lets us make use of great images in Registry Hub. And Ansible is here to auto-configure hypervisors. We combine them all together to deliver an amazing cloud panel that does the job.


We didn't forget about regular users without bare metal servers. VirtKick ships with optional e-commerce features, so VPS providers can use them to sell machines. This way we ensure VirtKick goodies are available for anyone. What's most important, you'll be able to migrate your machines between VPS providers.









Users deserve a cool, open source, privacy-enabled cloud panel for the modern Internet. VirtKick is a very ambitious but doable plan. Thanks for your support!







A Bonus is a complete set of features that integrates with third party services. That makes VirtKick a complete solution for professionals and businesses.
For every $20,000 raised we'll implement one Bonus. $75+ backers decide which by voting!




Spread the word about VirtKick and get packages for more than only 2 Linux distros. Each 1000 stars, followers or likes is one extra Linux distro!





Development process goes public on GitHub. VirtKick is licensed under GNU AGPL. Anybody is able to download it and use for free - even commercially.
Additionally, $199+ backers will receive a non-copyleft license for the sources. This may be useful for companies that want to develop their own modules and keep them secret. Most companies should be fine with the default license.
There will be a testing deployment of VirtKick. We'll grant access to every $25+ backer. There won't be any specific releases - the development will be continuous. A new version will be deployed any time the automated tests pass,
Our $99+ backers will get exclusive access to pre-releases of Linux packages and virtual appliances. They will go public after one month. Still, package sources will be public at all times. 100% open source - remember.



A lot of real code is already written and published on GitHub. But don't take our word for it - just have a look at the hosted alpha and give it a try! It offers a limited set of features, but is a great proof that VirtKick really works.

Technically, it's a server-side generated Rails web-application with some alive parts in AngularJS. On the backend there's WebVirtMgr that acts as a RESTful proxy to libvirt (we'll later replace it with Fog.io). Background tasks are ran with Delayed::Job, though we might switch do Sidekiq in future (it's no effort thanks to ActiveJob abstraction introduced in Rails 4.2 beta). Instead of relying on Apache or nginx, we make use of http-master, a web server implemented in node.js. It's also used to serve VNC on websockets (Websockify and noVNC are involved).
One-click install & auto-configuration is one of our core features. At the moment, we almost achieved it on desktop environments, where the local machine is the hypervisor. All you need is to execute virtkick-start command and type your password when asked for sudo. But we don't mess with your OS very much - we only create a new user, install a few packages and configure libvirt. Crucial parts of VirtKick we depend on are either installed in the system (Python) or in VirtKick directory (Ruby from RVM, Node.js from NVM). After you open VirtKick in your browser, we create a network, initialize storage pools and download ISO images of most popular Linux distros. VirtKick doesn't run as root.
Additionally, we've got a static prototype with most planned features. The user interface is already prototyped and designed. Click through the application yourself at demo.virtkick.io and get familiar with all planned features.







Here's what VirtKick will let you do after we implement Basic Bundle:

create accounts for users and administrators
create and start using a VM in no more than 59 seconds
manage your VM - start, stop, restart, mount ISO, create disk, etc.
let other users manage your VM
everything with a simple, lightweight and comfortable UI

Next Bundles add more and more features on top of it. One thing remains the same - all is still simple!



This is what you should expect from VirtKick once we implement Basic Bundle:


support for KVM through libvirt

distros available by default: Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, CoreOS, Arch, FreeBSD

ready to use appliance with SSH key copied onto the VM
mount ISO as CD and install yourself


one-click install with reasonable default values
auto-configure hypervisors
import existing libvirt domains
IP reservation, clean-traffic nwfilter applied to every VM
add additional disks
access console with noVNC
packages for 2+ Linux distributions (see Social Stretch Goals for more)
appliances or images for Docker, VirtualBox and Qemu-KVM
Facebook integration ;-)

Other Bundles should be pretty self-explanatory, but drop us a line if in doubt!










For the service fees and hardware maintenance:


For hardware to actually test VirtKick on. As part of release process we want to run automated infrastructure tests. We'll test VirtKick against multiple distros and multiple virtualization technologies. We'll need at least 10 cheap bare metal servers, which is around $600 a month.

For Amazon EC2 account to test VirtKick on. If we reach the stretch goal, we'll need it to test the APIs and run integration tests. It will be around $300 a month.

For our own servers. We currently have two bare metal servers in collocation - these servers run the hosted instance. We need it to catch unhandled exceptions, spot performance problems and analyze what features people use. It costs us $100 a month.


For infrastructure monitoring. We need to know its state and be notified about alerts and problems. New Relic, Pingdom and PubNub will cost us up to $100 a month.

For 3rd party services. Since we will be integrating with many external APIs (e.g. helpdesk, transactional e-mails, etc), we will have to subscribe for their paid plans. Depending on how many Bonuses will be implemented, it will cost us from $20 to $200 a month.

For placing bounties on BountySource. We'll do that to get some features implemented in 3rd party open source projects that we are not able to handle. Usually $100-$500 for a bounty, but not sure about how many of them there'll be a need to post.

And for the team:






For Damian N., the Ruby developer, who codes the Rails webapp, Ruby backend and makes it all speak virtualization.


For Damian K., the node.js developer, who codes node.js parts of the project, and who will soon contribute to libvirt project.

For Wojtek, the graphic designer, who designs a clean and usable user interface and a lot of artwork for media.


For Mateusz, the experienced sysops, who manages our infrastructure and helps us tackle the nasty parts of networks, storage and provisioning.

For Mirek, the copywriter, who makes the texts more understandable. ;-)

The more we raise, the longer we can work on VirtKick and other related projects.








Damian Nowak, or Nowaker, has been a software developer for 5 years. He spent last 3 years working in hosting-related businesses. He not only knows virtualization from inside-out but also has great ideas on how to simplify it. He adapted ""Howdy partner"" as his primary greeting and you could easily mistake him for a true cowboy. Husband and father of two kids. Soon three.
Damian Kaczmarek, or Rush, has been coding embedded devices for 5 years, but found his second calling in node.js. He worked on a big AngularJS project for a year and develops http-master, a node.js HTTP server. After hours he codes various stuff for Unreal Tournament community. The only social website he uses is GitHub. Indiegogo is the first place he has uploaded his real photo. Still, with sunglasses on.



All funds received here count towards the stretch goals.

We'd like to thank the open source community for supporting our efforts. Thank you for spreading the word, testing alpha version, deploying on your servers, finding bugs and encouraging us to run the fundraising!
These folks gave us a whole lot of valuable feedback on our Indiegogo campaign. Without your help it wouldn't look like this. Thank you very much!

<p><b>What Firmware does Alligator support?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Currently is available Repetier Firmware, but in a few days we'll also have MarlinKimbra porting.</p>
<p>Lately are emerging many dedicated 32 bit high-performance firmwares and with Alligator you'll stay up to date.</p>
<p><b>How can I program the board?</b></p>
<p>There are two possibilities:</p>
<p>- Arduino IDE, with which you'll have no need of buying expensive programs or studying  difficult development environments. You only have to connect the Alligator's USB port to the PC.</p>
<p>- J-tag interface for the more experienced</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>What is the advantage of using this processor than ATmega2560?</b></p>
<p>With SAM3X8E you can print your pieces faster and at higher resolution.</p>
<p>For example if you decide to print a complex piece (as a woman's bust can be) with a standard 8 bit board, it can easily happen that the micro is not able to reckon on time and the printer moves jerkily. With Alligator this doesn't happen due to the increased computational power. </p>
<p>Besides this, it's no small matter that because of the board's speed the printer moves in a much more harmonious manner, and we can realize this even from the noise of the engines.</p>
<p>What's more with the computational power and the bigger space you can put more performing firmwares that will make the print always better.</p>
<p><b>What is the advantage of not having to handle an operating system?</b><br/>Not having to handle a complex operating system is an advantage for all real time operations. For example a cortex timer will be much more efficient.<br/>Alligator is much faster, and at the same time thanks to the expansion port for Raspberry you will enjoy all the additional features that an operating system can have. So Wify, USB, Ethernet will be available without overloading the printer control. In addition to this, the firmware that can be loaded on Alligator were written for years and can therefore provide much more stability than an operating system.<br/></p>
<p><b>Will Alligator be able to control a delta style printer and handle the segments calculations at higher levels? </b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Alligator is perfect for Delta printers.The tests carried out in laboratory have shown an excellent performance even in the presence of many segments/second.</p>
<p><b>Network interface and Raspberry-Pi. How can I use them?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The network interface on board provides the opportunity to integrate a web server to monitor and control the printer and manage files Gcode.</p>
<p>With Raspberry-Pi you can install Repetier server or any other web interface and you can do slicing and control everything by using your browser, including printing.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why do I want a Direct RaspberryPi connection, when I've got a</b></p>
<p><b>microcontroller on board, and the Pi can use the USB port?</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The microcontroller on Alligator is not able to perform the slicer and generate a</p>
<p>gcode, RaspberryPi instead can do it!</p>
<p>A direct connection is much more convenient, the communication takes place via</p>
<p>direct serial without going through any USB/Serial converter. Much more stable!</p>
<p>Also some gpio are shared between Raspberry and Alligator and this allows you to</p>
<p>add many features such as an interrupt to launch routine on Alligator, this without</p>
<p>going through UART or USB ports.</p>
<br/><p><b>How do I control the board when it is not connected to the PC? Has the SD slot been planned?</b></p>
<p>Alligator is equipped with an on board Micro SD card reader. You only have to to store the file to be printed (GCODE) in the memory card and launch the printing by using display or USB port.</p>
<p>Very soon it will be possible to start the printing via LAN with the Ethernet port.</p>
<p>Alligator has an expansion port that can be directly connected to the Raspberry-Pi. You'll have the opportunity of entering a Linux system in your machine! Everything will be easier and you may have features such as Slicer Gcode on board, full control of the machine via wifi, ethernet, bluetooth, printing notifications via email, webcam streaming.. a guaranteed fun!</p>
<p><b>What kind of display can be connected to Alligator Board?</b></p>
<p>You can connect the classic ""full graphics display 128x64"" with encoder and buzzer RepRap style.</p>
<p>Furthermore the display can be connected at both 3.3V and 5V:</p>
<p>- Alphanumeric</p>
<p>- SPI</p>
<p>- Serial (uart)</p>
<p>Sometimes you may need to add a small connector to arrange the order of the signals.</p>
<p>We're also developing a color display with touch interface. You'll very soon be able to control your machine with a touch of finger!</p>
<p><b>Can you connect servo motors, led or other?</b></p>
<p>Yes, you can connect servo, led, rgb led, relè and more. Clearly the pins available are modest.</p>
<p><b>""No Stop Print Filter"" . How exactly does it ensure I don't need a UPS to keep my print from being interrupted? </b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It's a given that a small power cut is often enough to block a print of many hours.</p>
<p>Example: You're making a 24 hours print. After 20 hours because of a disturbance due to a refrigerator, a washing machine, a neon or other, your printer stops, making you throw away time and money. We experienced this problem many times with the traditional boards , so we put on Alligator alimentation filter, USB filter and uncoupled GND signal which prevent these phenomena.</p>
<p>Alligator board being properly filtered and protected is immune to this type of problems. Your prints will be safe for many hours!</p>
<p><b>What does ""20A no blowing connector"" mean?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Let's say you're printing and a connector melts: besides the safety risk, you are forced to stop 3/4 days to order the piece, receive it and replace it. Here too, you threw a print, lost time and still had to buy other pieces.</p>
<p><b>""Precise Filtering"" on temperature reading. How is it more precise?</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Analog inputs are related to analog ground loops, these solutions are usually</p>
<p>implemented in quality boards.</p>
<p>The temperature inputs are actively filtered (not with a single capacitor as in other</p>
<p>boards). Thanks to this the readings are much more stable than traditional boards.</p>
<p><b>What do you mean with ""Complex Filter""? And why should it be better than a</b></p>
<p><b>""Simple Filter""?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>End­stop filters are extremely important: in Delta machines for proper calibration</p>
<p>it's essential that all trucks go home without false reading. Thus we have</p>
<p>introduced a specific active comparator that is an electronic solution by far more</p>
<p>stable compered to other boards that use only a simple capacitor as filtering.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>""Protection from gnd loops"" . What does it mean?</b></p>
<p>Many users complain of ground loops in their printers. With Alligator we have</p>
<p>minimized the problem by decoupling all round planes. We also added filters, both</p>
<p>common mode and differential mode to minimize every type of disturbance, and to</p>
<p>limit the effects of the loop due to the wiring.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What is the use of the driver soldered to the board? I've already burned a dozen drivers..</b></p>
<p>The driver on board allows an optimization of the circuitry that makes overheating a distant memory.</p>
<p>The drivers burn because if mounted on external boards can not dissipate heat and signals through connectors can get incorrect.</p>
<p>The traditional drivers are therefore significantly less stable over time both as current and as temperatures. </p>
<p></p>

<p>If you'd like to add funds for shipping, you can make an additional contribution. This counts as the shipping cost.</p>

High quality, high resolution and high speed.Alligator is an easy-to-use open source motherboard, ideal for all types of 3D printer. The additional specification lines make it sturdier and safer compared to the other boards, apart from increasing its resolution. Besides this, it’s no small matter that Alligator is able to interface effortless with most of the existing hardware.
It’s already a big step forward, but it doesn’t end here: making use of Alberto Cotronei (MagoKimbra) collaboration, we’re bringing all firmwares from 8 bit platforms to 32 ones, permitting a far greater computational power. 
Marlin porting will be available in a few days.We want to give makers and professionals the opportunity to use boards capable of printing high mesh objects and perform heavier counts, paying attention to Jerks and other aspects that up to now was not possible to consider.Alligator can run :
printers
Laser cutters
CNC mills
Pick and Place and other small or Mid-size CNC machines
Our ambition is to advance the entire community trough an open source motherboard, powerful and innovative. We hope that Alligator can be as useful to as many people and projects as possible.The Alligator Board is designed to be a complete and reliable solution as RepRap 3D printer electronic control board. The base module features everything you need to build a standard 3D printer, and with the expansion Piggy this is the most complete solution for complex 3D printer.








It is based on the 32 bit Cortex M3 ATSAM3X8EA-AU microcontroller (Arduino Due CPU). This represents a big step towards greater computing power, compared to the existing solution based on 8 bit mcu. This product is well suited for any kind of 3D printer and is the ideal solution for Delta models, requiring more complex computation.Alligator is the first 3D printer motherboard supporting direct connection to Linux embedded world.3D printers need a PC and an operating system to process models and generate GCODE printing files. Alligator Board with the expansion port for Raspberry-Pi becomes a whole with Linux.By simply connecting Raspberry-PI to Alligator you'll discover countless features, such as WIFI, bluetooth, full tablet control, slicer on board, and much more!With Raspberry-Pi you can install a web interface to control your printer  remotely and you can do slicing and control everything by using your browser, including printing.

What is the use of the driver soldered to the board? I've already burned a dozen drivers..
The driver on board allows an optimization of the circuitry that makes overheating a distant memory.
The drivers burn because if mounted on external boards can not dissipate heat and signals through connectors can get incorrect.
The traditional drivers are therefore significantly less stable over time both as current and as temperatures.

Already have plans for 2022? We got you! The Future Log is a 2022 calendar and an events planner in one.

Expense Trackers
Writing down all your expenses makes you more mindful of your money habits. At the beginning of each month, an expense tracker is provided, but should you need more, we will have free printables available on our website after the campaign for you to download.

  The first step to planning is actually wanting to open up your planner. With its unique monthly designs, you will never get bored of the DYL Planner. Each month is like a fresh start; an opportunity for new beginnings– even during the middle of the year.  Want a pretty planner but just don't have time to decorate every single page? The DYL Planner is already pre-designed to keep you motivated and inspired while leaving you with extra time to accomplish the important stuff. Each page is thoughtfully-designed with you in mind. As graphic designers, we obsessed with every little detail--the spacing, fonts, colors, copy, and all the other things you don’t need to think about. We’ve also been constantly redesigning and improving the features based on thousands of feedback from the DYL community. Of course, we made it aesthetically-pleasing too so it can excite you every. single. day. No more pressure of making your planner look pretty; it already is!  Aside from all that goodness, there are also these awesome features: 
 12-month weekly planner (Jan-Dec 2021). Your best year yet.
 6.5″ x 8.5″ (A5 plus the tabs). A handy, portable size that can fit in your bag.
 Expandable back pocket. For all your receipts, stickers, and maybe snacks?

 2 different-colored bookmarks. Distinguish where you’re at.
 Tabbed pages. Flip through productivity pages and months so quick.
 120 gsm FSC Certified paper. That thick, luxurious paper feeling that doesn't bleed through. Also eco-friendly!
 Round-edged, hard cover with matte finish. Sleek and sturdy.
 Lay-flat binding (new for 2021). Righties and lefties unite!
 Monday start. Plus, Saturdays and Sundays are their own days like they should be, not combined into one.
 192 pages. Full of useful, no-fuss pages.
 Holidays. US, Philippine, and fun holidays.
 Motivational quotes all throughout the year.
 Bonus: 2 sticker sheets! Because, why not?
  We’ve already built a community that loves designing their lives and we’d love for you to be part of it! By backing the Design Your Life 2021 Planner, you also get access to our printables library-- a resource for additional productivity tools based on requests from members of the DYL community. Join our DYL community on Facebook and Instagram! Know anyone who would love their own DYL 2021 Planner? Let them know or gift one to them!

<p></p></div>","Introducing the development of a Hybrid GPS Navigational APP unlike any other, that will Integrate All the Major Internet Social Networks into One Seamless Real Time Display Navigational   Social Network:TheGPSbook.com       This app will Totally Revolutionize the way we connect by enhancing the entire way the internet social networking operates. This will be an APP that works on any mobile device that will integrate it’s GPS with all the major internet social network sites. The best way to describe how this APP will operate, feel, and look is think the video game “The Sims” meets your GPS Navigation mixed with Facebook / Foursquare / Twitter / Instagram / Bitstrips and etc. The beginning stages of developing this APP is already underway by one of the Largest Mobile App Developing Companies in the World - Zco Corporation www.zco.com who we are contracting as our programming team. Zco Corporation is a work for hire only APP Software development company and are excited to be on board for this project once the funding is raised! Be sure to check out their impressive work and resume as they are the right APP developing Company for the job on building this APP.  According to Zco's estimates It will take 300 working days to build this APP based on these Screen Shots, 3D GPS Mapping, Website and Social Networking Support, and along with all these New Innovative Navigational Features.Design Build For Mobile Device Operating System Platforms:1. Complete Facebook Integration.No need to add a new friends. Simply check mark the friends from your Facebook friends list who you want locate and be located by.as well as integration of the rest of the other Social Network add on's that include statuses, pictures, and videos of you and your friends location.2. Follow Mode.How many times have you been on a long distance road trip with a 
caravan of vehicles and you got stuck behind a traffic light and lost your 
lead??
This App will let you track all your friends involved the road trip and 
Navigate you in a follow mode so you never lose their lead, even if they pull off 
on an exit to a gas station, restaurant, etc..   3. Meet UP's & CheckPoints
Ever Been to a large festival or amusement park with a 
group of people, split up and then later need to find each other or want to 
navigate to the location where they are?
4. Post Status / NewsFeed /  APP TaggingUsers can Post Status Bubbles of current locations. Integrate with other Social Apps by tagging pictures, videos, sounds, and etc generated by them to their locations. With a integrated News Feed Linked with Facebook & Twitter.Turn Your Visibility to be located by friends ON/OFF with a default auto turn off Security Timer.  Set proximity alerts when any friends come within a set distance of where your at, and stay closer connected to what’s going on socially in your area!


According to Zco's estimates it will take 300 working days to build this APP based on these Screen Shots, 3D GPS Mapping, Website and Social Networking Support, along with all these New Innovative Navigational Features. For an approximate Zco's quoted labor costs of $130,000.  I will be working closely hand in hand with the Zco programming team Managing the production as the lead Design, making decisions on the creation of the feature flow of how the APP will stylishly operate, similar to how a Director or Producer creates a Movie or Music. The Goal of $350,000 amount of funding I am raising will cover this expense including any extras Zco may incur during the build, with the remaining balance of funds raised will be used for minor operating costs during development. Including covering All the expenses for Perk Rewards, and most of all, for the most important cost for it's success, the Majority of the remaining funds going towards Marketing the App!In case we don't reach our goals of funding during this campaign we will still full-fill every Perk Contributed.

<p>Thank you for visiting my project page. I have spent the
past year developing a proof of concept privacy extension for the Firefox. The
privacy extension enables you to send emails that only your recipients can
read. It works but it is not yet ready for public release. That is where you
come in. I would appreciate if you would help fund this project so that I can
turn the proof of concept into a finished product which will deliver secure
emails. Please take a few moments and read on to find out whether you would be
interested in supporting this project. </p>
<h2>What is the problem:</h2>
<p>At the moment if you want to use Gmail you have no choice as to whether your email is private or not. This
means that the content of your emails can be viewed by your provider. They can use your email for any purpose they choose
which could be anything from targeted advertising or sharing your details with
the American government. Overseas organisations do not recognise UK laws
regarding an individuals right to privacy and the UK government does not
enforce them.</p>

protection of the rights and freedoms of others. </span></p>

<p>I have designed and successfully tested a mechanism that
abstracts the process of securing the mail from the mechanism that sends it. </p>
<h2>What is the project:</h2>
<p>I have developed the proof of concept that delivers ""better

anyone can use. My aim is to deliver a product that will always be free for

<p>The system will initially operate as a browser add-on. This
is used to request an encryption key from the Key Distribution Server (KDS).

Eva is a piece of art--she works with an integrated mobile application called ATOM which operates on both iOS and Android platforms. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What are they?</strong></p>
<p>ATOM+Eva is a remote alarm clock, meaning you will have to physically get out of bed to turn the alarm off.  Unlike other remote alarm clocks, ATOM+Eva  is for everyone! It's portable, it looks great, and it's going to do the job! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How do they work?</strong></p>
<p>Great question!  Eva contains a one of a kind QR Code which responds to ATOM, a mobile device application.  Simply place Eva on your bathroom mirror or anywhere else that you visit when you first wake up.  Next, set ATOM (your alarm) for when you would like to wake up.  Finally when ATOM begins to alert you in the morning you will have to get out of your bed and scan Eva with the built in code scanner, once you do this, your alarm will then go off. The fact that you are actually out of your bed will do wonders in so many facets of life--productivity, you can actually make breakfast, you can see the sun rise, create an exercise routine and so much more!  And if you don't want to use ATOM+Eva for all that, but simply just want to wake up on time...they are there for that too! </p>
<p>ATOM+Eva are of course a two part pair: You can download ATOM as an app on any iOS or Android mobile device. (You will receive an activation code when you receive Eva.) Eva is a beautiful anodized aluminum badge, containing a custom QR code, that is highly durable and includes a strong mini suction cup to stick to any flat non-pourus surface. Eva is also water resistant in the event she ends up in some place she shouldn't necessarily be.</p>
<div class=""template asset""> </div>
<div class=""template asset"">
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>You may be wondering where we came up with names for ATOM+Eva...well here it is. Once we found out how much we liked calling the beautiful aluminum badge Eva, we came up with ATOM and an acronym to suit. So ATOM is the app side of things which stands for A-larm T-echnology O-ptimization M-eans and Eva is his much needed partner. Also, Eva, defined in Hebrew means ""to live, to rise, or life."" So we were really excited about that because after all, ATOM+Eva's job is to wake you up and give you life each morning! There is also that very popular play on words of the famous Biblical beings ""Adam and Eve."" They are very distant relatives of course and happy to share similar namesake!!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>ATOM App Modes</strong></p>
<p>Don't worry--we don't want you to destroy your mobile device, so to help you out we have designed several modes for you to pick from. </p>
<p><em>""Stealth Mode"" </em>-- Set ATOM to Stealth mode and he will begin to alert you at the time you set.  He will continue ringing for 10 seconds--he will then become silent for the next 90 seconds, this time should be used to get out of bed and scan Eva to turn ATOM off.  We have designed this aspect for those that have roommates or really grumpy wives/husbands/girlfriends/boyfriends that will go crazy if they continue hearing ATOM alerting them non-stop.  If you scan Eva within the initial 100 seconds, no worries, ATOM is now off and most importantly you are out of your bed.  If you did not successfully scan Eva within the first 100 seconds--go pack your bags or promptly start apologizing...no, seriously you can still turn ATOM off, but he will continue alerting you until you scan Eva...no more quiet time!</p>
<p><em>""Away Mode""</em> -- Of course ATOM+Eva do not want to be apart! We want you to take them with you on road trips to relatives, to be a part of your business trips,  and when you have a sleep over at a friends house.  Away Mode is simple, when you get to where you are staying, go place Eva where you want to scan her for your wake up call.  When ATOM begins alerting you in the morning you will wake up as usual and scan Eva to turn ATOM off--a second scan will then be required to turn off a second alert from ATOM reminding you to get Eva from wherever she is!  If you forget Eva behind even after the second scan...shame on you, ATOM reminded you to pick her up!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Your Help</strong></p>
<p>We currently have a prototype of ATOM+Eva and they work great together! There are always hurdles and minimum quantities to order and unfortunately the hours the guys spend developing and testing is not free--so we really need your help!  Eva is looking great and we can't wait to see her in your hands--or on your mirror--or wherever you decide to place her, but she also has cost to make her look so great.  This is where you come in again, in order for us to get ATOM+Eva to you, we need to make orders that are efficient for both of us (and ATOM+Eva of course)...you as a backer will enable us to keep our cost at an efficient level and allow all of us; you, the team, and ATOM+Eva to be happy and in the homes of you, our backers! </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Benefits</strong></p>
<p>ATOM+Eva are for everyone!!!! Young or old can benefit and enjoy ATOM+Eva. Not many of us use regular old alarm clocks anymore because lets face it...they are old.  The use of ATOM in your mobile device means he is always with you, and Eva is portable and durable, so take her with you too! Reliable--ATOM+Eva are designed to work! If you keep pressing the snooze button, you will never get out of bed, but if you have to physically get up, you are...well, up! </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rewards</strong></p>
<p>ATOM+Eva are the reward!!! We have an Early Bird special which can allow you to get ATOM+Eva as a backer pledging less than what they will retail for, don't miss this opportunity!!! If you aren't lucky enough to grab it early, don't worry--there are several pledge levels available. </p>
<p>This is a great list of rewards with awesome benefits to you, our backers! Spread the word to all of your friends and tell them how cool ATOM+Eva will be, and don't worry we will have them ready well in time for Christmas and they will make a great stocking stuffer for all of those sleepy heads in your families!!!</p>

There are always hurdles and minimum quantities to order and unfortunately the hours the guys spend developing and testing is not free--so we really need your help!  Eva is looking great and we can't wait to see her in your hands--or on your mirror--or wherever you decide to place her, but she also has cost to make her look so great.  This is where you come in again, in order for us to get ATOM+Eva to you, we need to make orders that are efficient for both of us (and ATOM+Eva of course)...you as a backer will enable us to keep our cost at an efficient level and allow all of us; you, the team, and ATOM+Eva to be happy and in the homes of you, our backers! 
 
The Benefits
ATOM+Eva are for everyone!!!! Young or old can benefit and enjoy ATOM+Eva. Not many of us use regular old alarm clocks anymore because lets face it...they are old.  The use of ATOM in your mobile device means he is always with you, and Eva is portable and durable, so take her with you too! Reliable--ATOM+Eva are designed to work! If you keep pressing the snooze button, you will never get out of bed, but if you have to physically get up, you are...well, up! 
 
The Rewards
ATOM+Eva are the reward!!! We have an Early Bird special which can allow you to get ATOM+Eva as a backer pledging less than what they will retail for, don't miss this opportunity!!! If you aren't lucky enough to grab it early, don't worry--there are several pledge levels available. 
This is a great list of rewards with awesome benefits to you, our backers! Spread the word to all of your friends and tell them how cool ATOM+Eva will be, and don't worry we will have them ready well in time for Christmas and they will make a great stocking stuffer for all of those sleepy heads in your families!!!

Medsembly is here to create a way for everyone in the healthcare profession to feasibly meet and network. The goal of our app is to unite all careers and offer endless resources and tools to aid in the success of our everyday superheroes, and to subsequently produce a stronger alliance within the medical field.
 
WHY MEDSEMBLY?
 
The Problem
Healthcare: One of the largest job sectors, a billion dollar industry, nearly 100 million students, employees and prospects, but no hub. There is no central area both virtual or actual that affords these crucial members of society an avenue to meet, share knowledge and ideas, help one another, and create lasting friendships.

The Solution:

 
Medsembly is a healthcare conglomerate! It allows our users a practical way to network and more! Our app will serve as an all-in-one for members in healthcare, where we will offer endless tools to aid in their learning. Along with the ability to chat and direct message peers, we have a dedicated resources page with direct access to third party, peer-reviewed apps and tools. These third party resources are well known, frequently used by our founder and recommended by others in the healthcare industry.

And finally, users can constantly test their knowledge and stay up-to-date on latest practices by answering case studies and practice questions.

<td>The SmartBand enables unique user recognition. This means CHiP recognizes the wearer as its master.<br/><br/> 

Additionally, you can use the SmartBand to:<br/>
- Reward good behavior. ""Like"" certain behavior by hitting the ""like"" button on the band. CHiP learns what you like and what you don't like, and adjusts accordingly.<br/> 
- Tell CHiP to come. If you want your CHiP at your side, simply hit the location pin on the band.<br/> 
- Attack. Little brother being a pest? Sic CHiP on him!<br/>
- Control CHiP's movements. The SmartBand doubles as a joystick for remote control. </td>

<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><b>What does the Smartbed do?</b></span></td>
<td>One of our favorite features of CHiP is the SmartBed.  Whenever CHiP gets low on power, and is within range of the SmartBed, CHiP will make its way back.  As for the actual battery life, we are currently testing and optimizing the battery life.  We expect to the production units to have hours of battery life in continuous mode and even longer in standby modes.</td>

<td>The CHiP app serves many functions and enables even more layers of gameplay:<br/><br/>

1. Notification Center: The CHiP app lets you gauge the status of CHiP's vitals - how happy, hungry, and energetic CHiP is feeling. If one area becomes deficient, the app pushes a notification to the user.<br/>
2. Tricks: When CHiP learns a new trick as a result of a new interaction with a user, the App stores it in CHiP's trickbook, and you can reward CHiP with a ""Like"" or a treat. It also lets CHiP's master access and replay these with a tap of a button.<br/>
3. Feed CHiP.<br/>
4. Secondary commands for SmartBand: The SmartBand responds to a ""tap"" and a ""hold"". Thus, the user can choose and program all kinds of secondary shortcuts on his/her SmartBand through the CHiP app. <br/>
5. Turn your smartphone or tablet into a remote control for CHiP to control his movements.</td>

<td>We don't have the official compatibility listing yet, but popular Android and iOS devices will be supported. WowWee has a long history developing SmatPhone controlled robots and devices, we work hard to support as many devices as possible.  You can refer to the device compatibility for the MiP robot to get a sense of what our products currently support.  This list may change as your device operating system gets updated, as new devices come out, and as we develop the CHiP firmware and electronics.</td>

<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><b>Can I throw the SmartBall?</b></span></td>
<td>Despite the fact that we designed the SmartBall to be very resilient to drops and shocks, we don't recommend throwing the SmartBall on to hard surfaces, or subjecting it to severe impacts. Generally speaking, a light toss, or rolling motion is preferred and will result in the best play experience indoors.</td>

<td>CHiP has mecanum wheels which we selected as they allow for some pretty amazing movement.  Using these wheels, CHiP can move in any direction and is therefore fully omni-directional.  We think this is cool because it means that CHiP can chase a ball, slide sideways to block a ball, follow you very quickly, and generally be very responsive and agile.</td>

<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><b>CHiP wheels look they can be replaced.</b></span></td>
<td>Yes, we decided to future proof CHiPs wheels so that in the future, if we come up with variations on size, performance, etc, it will be really easy to replace the wheels.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><b>How fast will CHiP move?</b></span></td>
<td>It's a bit early to clock in CHiP's top speed as we are still tuning the gearboxes, motors, and electronics. CHiP will move very quickly and the video shows the current motion and speed of our existing prototypes. We expect the production CHiPs to be just as fast and possibly faster.</td>

<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><b>What is the range of the BeaconSense<b>™ </b> system?</b></span></td>
<td>The BeaconSense™<b> </b> system allows CHiP to track its accessories (the SmartBall, SmartWatch, and SmartBand). The range is several meters and this covers most room sizes. It's possible that CHiP may be blocked from seeing its accessories if there are walls or other obstacles in the way. However, the system is very robust and we have launched many products using this type of technology. If CHiP needs to recharge but is really far from the SmartBed, or in a different room, it will alert you via the Bluetooth link and the app and ask for a hand getting back to the SmartBed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><b>Will the BeaconSense™ system work between rooms?</b></span></td>
<td>We are actively improving the BeaconSense™ system and we expect to develop the technology so that we can provide multiple beacons in a pack that can be placed around a home to build a mesh of navigational beacons.  That would enable CHiP to truly navigate your home. We are also refining the obstacle avoidance algorithms and any/all improvements will be made available through firmware updates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><b>What is the SmartBand?</b></span></td>
<td>The SmartBand is a sleek, rechargeable, wearable wristband. It is packed with technology (BeaconSense™ and Bluetooth) that lets CHiP know where you are and what you want.  When you walk into a room, CHiP will react and come towards you.  It also has buttons on it so you can activate CHiPs capabilities or movements with great convenience.  For example you can use the SmartBand to have CHiP come, heel, or stay.  You can even tell CHiP when you like something by tapping the Like button on the remote, and CHiP will learn your preferences.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><b>What is the SmartBall?</b></span></td>
<td>The SmartBall is CHiP's favorite toy. Like the SmartBand, the SmartBall is packed with sensors and wireless abilities. This allows CHiP to know where the SmartBall is, pick it up, bring it to you, or simply play. It enables soccer-type play, fetch and CHiP can play with his toy any time it's in range.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><b>What can I do with both of these items?</b></span></td>
<td>You can do countless things with these devices, but here is one example: When you play fetch with CHiP, the SmartBand and the SmartBall work together so that CHiP can find the ball, and bring it back to you. CHiP can also play soccer with you and guard a goal from incoming shots, or simply pass the ball back to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><b>Does CHiP have voice recognition?</b></span></td>
<td>We want to provide a seamless experience for the user. That being said, we have been exploring several different voice recognition technologies and we are looking for the best solution. Rest assured, that it's one of our major goals to crack by the time the product ships.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><b>Can CHiP climb stairs?</b></span></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><b>Can CHiP walk on carpets?</b></span></td>
<td>CHiP's mecanum wheel design allows him to roll across most floor surfaces - including hardwood floors, tile, and low pile carpeting.  
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><span style=""color: #363636;font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight: 100;""><b>Can CHiP be used outside?</b></span></td>
<td>CHiP is pretty good on most floor surfaces, and might work well on a smoothly paved road, but the rollers on his meccanum wheels would not do well on rough pavement or gravel. We did design CHiPs wheels to be removable/swappable, and it's possible that given demand, we will be releasing outdoor wheels. 

<br/><br/>

While CHiP can probably handle the smooth pavement, his BeaconSense system uses infrared light, which operates in the 940nm frequency, and while it can function outdoors (which is why that frequency is used) its range is very limited, no more than a couple feet, and can have interference in strong sunlight. He can be driven using the CHiP App out doors, but his tracking skills would be very limited. Also note that CHiP is not waterproof, and should not get wet.</td>

<td>We are shooting for CHiP to easily get through an active day.  But like any Dog CHiP will need a recharge periodically or after significant use.  One of our main goals with CHiP is to eliminate the worry and inconvenience of having to charge or change batteries.  </td>

What comes in the box?
- CHiP Robot Dog 
- SmartBand: Enables unique user recognition
- SmartBall: Play fetch
- SmartBed: CHiP is rechargeable and autonomously self docks.


What does the Smartband do?
The SmartBand enables unique user recognition. This means CHiP recognizes the wearer as its master. 

Additionally, you can use the SmartBand to:
- Reward good behavior. ""Like"" certain behavior by hitting the ""like"" button on the band. CHiP learns what you like and what you don't like, and adjusts accordingly. 
- Tell CHiP to come. If you want your CHiP at your side, simply hit the location pin on the band. 
- Attack. Little brother being a pest? Sic CHiP on him!
- Control CHiP's movements. The SmartBand doubles as a joystick for remote control. 


What does the Smartball do?
CHiP can track the ball in real time, which means that you can play games together. CHiP can play fetch and even soccer! 


What does the Smartbed do?
One of our favorite features of CHiP is the SmartBed.  Whenever CHiP gets low on power, and is within range of the SmartBed, CHiP will make its way back.  As for the actual battery life, we are currently testing and optimizing the battery life.  We expect to the production units to have hours of battery life in continuous mode and even longer in standby modes.


What can I do with the CHiP app?
The CHiP app serves many functions and enables even more layers of gameplay:

1. Notification Center: The CHiP app lets you gauge the status of CHiP's vitals - how happy, hungry, and energetic CHiP is feeling. If one area becomes deficient, the app pushes a notification to the user.
2. Tricks: When CHiP learns a new trick as a result of a new interaction with a user, the App stores it in CHiP's trickbook, and you can reward CHiP with a ""Like"" or a treat. It also lets CHiP's master access and replay these with a tap of a button.
3. Feed CHiP.
4. Secondary commands for SmartBand: The SmartBand responds to a ""tap"" and a ""hold"". Thus, the user can choose and program all kinds of secondary shortcuts on his/her SmartBand through the CHiP app. 
5. Turn your smartphone or tablet into a remote control for CHiP to control his movements.

Device Compatibility
We don't have the official compatibility listing yet, but popular Android and iOS devices will be supported. WowWee has a long history developing SmatPhone controlled robots and devices, we work hard to support as many devices as possible.  You can refer to the device compatibility for the MiP robot to get a sense of what our products currently support.  This list may change as your device operating system gets updated, as new devices come out, and as we develop the CHiP firmware and electronics.


How Rugged is CHiP
CHiP is pretty tough and goes through extensive abuse testing.  We do ask that you take reasonable care and avoid hard drops, staircases, water, and other situations that could damage CHiP.


Can I throw the SmartBall?
Despite the fact that we designed the SmartBall to be very resilient to drops and shocks, we don't recommend throwing the SmartBall on to hard surfaces, or subjecting it to severe impacts. Generally speaking, a light toss, or rolling motion is preferred and will result in the best play experience indoors.


CHiP has really cool looking wheels, what are those?  And why does CHiP have wheels like that?
CHiP has mecanum wheels which we selected as they allow for some pretty amazing movement.  Using these wheels, CHiP can move in any direction and is therefore fully omni-directional.  We think this is cool because it means that CHiP can chase a ball, slide sideways to block a ball, follow you very quickly, and generally be very responsive and agile.


CHiP wheels look they can be replaced.
Yes, we decided to future proof CHiPs wheels so that in the future, if we come up with variations on size, performance, etc, it will be really easy to replace the wheels.


How fast will CHiP move?
It's a bit early to clock in CHiP's top speed as we are still tuning the gearboxes, motors, and electronics. CHiP will move very quickly and the video shows the current motion and speed of our existing prototypes. We expect the production CHiPs to be just as fast and possibly faster.


What is the range of the BeaconSense™  system?
The BeaconSense™  system allows CHiP to track its accessories (the SmartBall, SmartWatch, and SmartBand). The range is several meters and this covers most room sizes. It's possible that CHiP may be blocked from seeing its accessories if there are walls or other obstacles in the way. However, the system is very robust and we have launched many products using this type of technology. If CHiP needs to recharge but is really far from the SmartBed, or in a different room, it will alert you via the Bluetooth link and the app and ask for a hand getting back to the SmartBed.


Will the BeaconSense™ system work between rooms?
We are actively improving the BeaconSense™ system and we expect to develop the technology so that we can provide multiple beacons in a pack that can be placed around a home to build a mesh of navigational beacons.  That would enable CHiP to truly navigate your home. We are also refining the obstacle avoidance algorithms and any/all improvements will be made available through firmware updates.


What is the SmartBand?
The SmartBand is a sleek, rechargeable, wearable wristband. It is packed with technology (BeaconSense™ and Bluetooth) that lets CHiP know where you are and what you want.  When you walk into a room, CHiP will react and come towards you.  It also has buttons on it so you can activate CHiPs capabilities or movements with great convenience.  For example you can use the SmartBand to have CHiP come, heel, or stay.  You can even tell CHiP when you like something by tapping the Like button on the remote, and CHiP will learn your preferences.


What is the SmartBall?
The SmartBall is CHiP's favorite toy. Like the SmartBand, the SmartBall is packed with sensors and wireless abilities. This allows CHiP to know where the SmartBall is, pick it up, bring it to you, or simply play. It enables soccer-type play, fetch and CHiP can play with his toy any time it's in range.


What can I do with both of these items?
You can do countless things with these devices, but here is one example: When you play fetch with CHiP, the SmartBand and the SmartBall work together so that CHiP can find the ball, and bring it back to you. CHiP can also play soccer with you and guard a goal from incoming shots, or simply pass the ball back to you.


Does CHiP have voice recognition?
We want to provide a seamless experience for the user. That being said, we have been exploring several different voice recognition technologies and we are looking for the best solution. Rest assured, that it's one of our major goals to crack by the time the product ships.


Can CHiP climb stairs?
Unfortunately no, CHiP is a one floor pup.


Can CHiP walk on carpets?
CHiP's mecanum wheel design allows him to roll across most floor surfaces - including hardwood floors, tile, and low pile carpeting.  



Can CHiP be used outside?
CHiP is pretty good on most floor surfaces, and might work well on a smoothly paved road, but the rollers on his meccanum wheels would not do well on rough pavement or gravel. We did design CHiPs wheels to be removable/swappable, and it's possible that given demand, we will be releasing outdoor wheels. 



While CHiP can probably handle the smooth pavement, his BeaconSense system uses infrared light, which operates in the 940nm frequency, and while it can function outdoors (which is why that frequency is used) its range is very limited, no more than a couple feet, and can have interference in strong sunlight. He can be driven using the CHiP App out doors, but his tracking skills would be very limited. Also note that CHiP is not waterproof, and should not get wet.


Is Chip rechargeable or it works on same AAA/AA batteries?
CHiP is rechargeable. The SmartBand is rechargeable.



If it is rechargeable than how much time it generally takes and what is play time
on full recharge?
We are shooting for CHiP to easily get through an active day.  But like any Dog CHiP will need a recharge periodically or after significant use.  One of our main goals with CHiP is to eliminate the worry and inconvenience of having to charge or change batteries.  


Where can CHiP play?
Low-cut carpet, hardwood floor, slippery tile. He’s an indoor dog!

It is often too difficult to handle so many nails in one job or shift, leading many skilled workers to break or cut the wood for disposal. This leads to disposal fees, as wood cannot be recycled if it has embedded nails, screws, or other metal fasteners. In addition to the cost of disposal, this practice is also very harmful f to the environment. This disposed wood is usually burned, causing its own form of pollution after which new trees would have to be felled to supply wood further depleting this limited natural resource.

  Heavy Duty Model:  Heavy Duty Model-More power.For working out doors.Capable of removing 4 inch nails or wood fastened with multiple nails and screw.  Founder/InventorMy name is Hamid Izadi. I am a mechanical engineer with more than 20 years of experience in the field of designing specialized machines and parts for various production lines; auto parts, gas valves, sanitary valves, and other mass produced precision parts. A history of my previous work is available on our website: www.bestindustrial.infoNasser ashgrizProfessor,Mechanical EngineeringIntellectual Property Advisor                                         Beniamin lenchner                                Production manager   Nazila Izadi   Networking,MarketingHow does this tool Positively impact the environment?This tool saves time for handymen, who would normally struggle with the manual removal of nails and screws. It is often too difficult to handle so many nails in one job or shift, leading many skilled workers to break or cut the wood for disposal. This leads to disposal fees, as wood cannot be recycled if it has embedded nails, screws, or other metal fasteners. In addition to the cost of disposal, this practice is also very harmful f to the environment. This disposed wood is usually burned, causing its own form of pollution after which new trees would have to be felled to supply wood further depleting this limited natural resource. Reuse and recycling of wood provides great environmental benefits as well as cost savings.                                        Your help is motivating to invent for this important.Our perks  standard modelRetail price :                                                                                         300  USDEarly Bird     :                      40% off + free shipping                    180  USD      Exclusive Indiegogo        30%off  + free shipping                     210  USD1 hp air compressor+air hosetype :oil-less,singel stage,direct drivepower:1 horspower,120V,220V,60Hz,9.5ADuty cycle:50%Tank size:3 US Gallon(11.4L)Motor type: Heavy duty inductionCut in pressuer:95 psi Cut off pressuer:125psiCompressor capacity : 3 CFM , 40psi, --  2 CFM ,90 psi Standard model+1 hp Air compressor+Air hoseRetail price :                                                                                           420 USDExclusive Indiegogo :          30%off+free shipping                     295 USD Heavy duty modelRetail price:                                                                                             400 USDEarly Bird:                                40%Off+free shipping                    240 USDExclusive Indiegogo;            30%Off+free shipping                    280 USDHeavy duty model+1 hp air compressor+Air hoseRetail price :                                                                                            520 USDExclusive Indiegogo:             30%Off+free shipping                    365 USD Common  QuestionsQ1: Do you have push pull power tool that be electric or cordless?We have designs for electric and cordless versions which will produced if this campaign is successful.

<br/> </h3></div></div>","MemoNote is a revolutionary digital e-writer. It is exquisitely designed with the five major functions you would need for your day to day activities namely; E-Writer Tablet, Power Bank, private notebook, reading light, and card holder. 
MemoNote allows you to preserve your thoughts instantly with its innovative dual writing mode. You can jot down ideas on the LCD writing tablet on the left and organize them on the paper on the right.








MemoNote is more than just a notebook. It simply gives you a passionate and creative experience with all its special features.

Make every creation an enjoyable experience from start to finish.
The 10.2 inch LCD Writing Tablet interface enables you to draw creative sketches, take unlimited notes, and it is your perfect tool for efficient communication.

You can make a to-do-list on MemoNote and start to organize your schedule right away!.

In addition, MemoNote’s paper notebook helps preserve treasured memories, daily activities and can also serve as a travel journal.


MemoNote was professionally developed and designed by writing enthusiasts and paper and pen experts. After a thorough research and series of analysis, we were able to come up with a special feature that makes writing on the digital screen feel the same as writing directly on the paper. With the aid of the stylus pen, you can write fluidly on the LCD writing screen and highlight texts easily. This superior technology enables you to write smoothly without any lag or disruption. Also, the LCD writing screen is gentle on the eyes.


You can endlessly use the tablet without running out of storage. It is perfect as a scratch & sketch paper. No matter taking a phone number in emergency or just doodling, using your tablet to spread your mind and save paper. You can delete anything with a simple press on Del button.

However if you accidently touch the screen, don't worry. The ""Everhold"" tech feature of the E-Writer tablet will hold your writing for as long as you desire.


We all deserve privacy and that was why we added an advanced motion lock feature to help protect your MemoNote. You can use MemoNote to store your diary, passwords and other private information. Our motion launch lock offers more than 10000 different sets to protect your privacy.



Memonote has an integrated light which can be switched on and off in just a jiffy. Whether you are on a night flight or in a dim living room, you can proceed with reading and writing under its moderate light without distracting others.


MemoNote features a built-in 7000mAh power bank that can charge iPhone XS Max 2 times, iPhone XS 2.5 times, Samsung Galaxy Note 9 2 times, and also provide power for the lock and light. The power bank is slim and hidden just behind the E-writer tablet, keeping the entire footprint of the MemoNote compact.


With MemoNote Digital E-writer, you can scan your work with your phone or take a picture and upload it to Cloud, Evernote, OneNote, Dropbox, and more. Your meeting notes, masterpieces, and documents will now be manageable and shareable.You are fully secured!


MemoNote is the ultimate tool for work and study. Loaded with tons of features, MemoNote weighs only 19oz (550g) as much as a regular notebook. MemoNote is an essential you need to have, whether on your office desk or in your bag. It basically makes life simpler and more organized!



Constructed with durable premium parts, MemoNote is built to last for years. The notebook is also replaceable, meaning you can insert another A5 size notebook or planner and continue using for years!

<h3>
<br/>1. What is VoD2?</h3>
<p>VoD2 is a cloud storage security solution that provides effective and comprehensive privacy and information protection. It does not offer cloud storage, but secures your data being stored, from the moment it leaves your device or your network, for as long as it is stored in the cloud.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>2. How does the VoD2 solution work?</h3>
<p>The VoD2 solution scrambles your data before it leaves your device and splits it into at least three slices that are totally unreadable. These three slices are sent to three different cloud storage providers, so that none of them have the entirety of your data, nor can they read the slice they are storing. Vod2 performs the reverse operation, whenever and wherever you want to access your data. Should any problem arise at a storage provider’s data center, VoD2 will still be able to recreate your original data with the remaining slices.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>3. Why is VoD2 a better security solution?</h3>
<p>Because VoD2 scrambles your data and splits it at the point of origin, it makes it practically impossible for anyone, including any cloud storage provider, to read or access your information once it is stored in the cloud. In addition, the VoD2 solution does not burden your files with overhead due to additional security measures put on by other providers. Finally it protects you from being totally dependent on any single storage provider.</p>

THE PROBLEM
Your information is stored in the cloud in its entirety with one storage provider. None of the existing security measures can fully protect your data from the weaknesses of this one-to-one relationship.
 
 

OUR SOLUTION 
The VoD2 solution scrambles your data before it leaves your device or your network and splits it into meaningless slices that are then sent to different storage providers. No storage provider has the entirety of your data nor can it read the slice it has in storage.
 
 

PEACE OF MIND 
In addition, should anything happen to any of the storage locations used (intrusion, breach, outage, etc.) the VoD2 solution will regenerate your original data using the remaining available slices.
 
 
SOME FACTS...
 
The number of devices (PCs, tablets, smart phones, etc.) will reach 4 billion by 2015, of which smart phones will represent half.

</p><p>Did you ever need to print an essay, a
business card, a CV, a strip of paper, a blueprint, a contract, a train ticket
or simply an envelope sticker?</p>
<p>You no longer need to search for a print

The new generation of pocket printers is here! PPrintee is an intelligent
high-tech printer that self-drives on paper, while analyzing the printing

directly, from your phone via the PPrintee app. In this case, PPrintee simply
finds the right positioning for printing and it starts printing. </p>

<p>We imagined different ways to
print mobile and we designed a high-tech intelligent mobile printer that can
fit in your pocket.</p>
<p>We wanted to capture fast, mobile and
high-quality printing in one single device; and this is how we have come up
with PPrintee.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/585496/files/20140517074638-DSC00961.jpg?1400337998"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>This is how it works. PPrintee moves on
paper, it searches for the paper’s edges, it positions; afterwards it starts
printing.  PPrintee analyses both its position in space and the printing surface. It is able to find the paper and to explore its format. It has two integrated scanning modules that assure a real-time synchronisation between the printing process and its movement on paper. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/586463/files/20140517172654-Schema.001.jpg?1400372814"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/585509/files/20140517075131-13.jpg?1400338291"" src="""" style=""width: 605.7692307692308px; height: 375px;""/></p><p></p><p>These two scanning modules are PPrintee’s
eyes. They see, while the printer thinks. They send feedback during the entire
printing process and help PPrintee take decisions and correct its actions.</p>
<p>The print head moves fast enough to obtain
a high fluidity in printing the paper. Behind PPrintee’s fluid movements, there
is an advanced mechanics of wheels and mobile cylinders, both activated by
micro-engines.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F95691790&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F95691790&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fb.vimeocdn.com%2Fthumbnails%2Fdefaults%2Fdefault.480x640.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>The wheels can make a 360 degrees turn and
they can also go out or retreat inside the cylinder. And this is how PPrintee
is able to lift or to lower its position.<br/></p>
<p>In the searching paper position, the
wheels are largely outside the device, providing a flexible movement.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/585501/files/20140517074906-06.jpg?1400338146"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>In the printing position, the wheels are
only a little bit outside the device, allowing the print head to smoothly touch
the paper and to coordinate the printing with the printer’s movement.</p><p>PPrintee's ink cartridges are designed in such a way that they can be easily refilled and also environmentally friendly. For the monochrome prototype, they can last up to 200 pages.

</p><p><b>Do you have a prototype? </b></p>
<p>We are working on it.  We have tested important elements of the product design, as well as the mobility and the printing functionalities. We will use the funds to manufacture the final PPrintee Prototype, including the development of both its firmware and software, and to launch the serial production.
You will be able to see photos and videos of this whole process in our campaign's updates and on our website
<a href=""http://www.pprintee.com."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.pprintee.com.</a> Join the PPrintee Community and share your ideas! </p>
<p><b>Who are you? How did you come up with this idea? </b></p>
<p>We are a team of enthusiastic creative
minds, engineers, technicians and entrepreneurs. One day in August 2013, as we
were discussing our professional needs, we came up with this wonderful idea: to
make printing mobile and thus open infinite possibilities for the printing
process in particular and visual arts in general.</p>
<p><b>How can I participate in this project? How can I join the PPrintee
Community?</b></p>
<p>You can support our project on Indiegogo.
We offer a lot of cool stuff in exchange of your contribution!</p>
<p>You can also support us by following our website
and the PPrintee Facebook Page, by telling your friends about our project and
by being in contact with other PPrintee Community Members. Please feel free to
exchange ideas with us and share your thoughts on PPrintee. We welcome any kind
of feed-back. Soon, we will print mobile. </p>
<p><b>Does PPrintee print in color?  </b></p>
<p>Not yet. The first PPrintee will be a
monochrome one, printing only black &amp; white. But be patient. We will also develop
the colour PPrintee.</p>
<p><b>Where can I buy a cartridge? How do I replace a cartridge?</b></p>
<p>PPrintee’s cartridges are environmentally
friendly ink cartridges, specially designed to be easily refilled or replaced. You can
buy them from us or from our retailers as soon as the PPrintee serial
production is on the market. </p>
<p><b>How long will black &amp; white cartridges last?</b></p>
<p>We are trying to fit a cartridge that
contains enough ink to print exactly like a desk inkjet printer. We have
estimated an approximate of 150 – 200 pages (A4) per cartridge. </p>
<p><b>How can I print on several consecutive pages?</b></p>
<p>It depends on how you configure the
printer. PPrintee can both stop after each page and tell you to change the
paper or it can look for another blank page available near the already printed
one and continue the printing task.</p><p></p>
<p><b>When do you build the printer?</b></p>
<p>Check our timeline in order to find all the
necessary information. We hope to start manufacturing PPrintee within a year.
The campaign’s page and our website <a href=""http://www.pprintee.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.pprintee.com</a> will keep you up to date
with the entire process.</p>
<p><b>Will you provide any warranty for the product?</b></p>

offers you the opportunity to print from everywhere and on any paper format!

Students, writers, architects, designers, engineers,
executives, artists and those of you who are always on the go, please welcome
PPrintee!  Enjoy great printing features,
no matter where you are!        

Did you ever need to print an essay, a
business card, a CV, a strip of paper, a blueprint, a contract, a train ticket
or simply an envelope sticker?
You no longer need to search for a print
shop or to get to your office or to your school to have your documents printed.
The new generation of pocket printers is here! PPrintee is an intelligent
high-tech printer that self-drives on paper, while analyzing the printing
surface.
It is designed to work with all paper
formats and it offers the same quality standards as an advanced desk printer. And what is most important, PPrintee fits
perfectly in your bag or in your pocket. PPrintee is itself free, mobile and easy
to use. Just place it close to a paper, send a print order via Bluetooth or
Wi-Fi and watch it while PPrintee does its job.The process is very simple. PPrintee gets to work as soon as a print order is received. It literally moves on the paper, seizing its edges, it positions itself and then it starts printing. If several papers are need to be printed, PPrintee tells you to change the paper or it searches for another blank paper nearby. It’s fun, it’s fast and it’s easy to
use. 
This amazing device generates fluid movements that are
perfectly synchronized with the speed of printing. Thanks to an advanced motion
system that works closely with a pair of integrated scanning modules, PPrintee
performs fully coordinated movements during the entire printing process.PPrintee takes autonomous decisions. But don’t worry! It won’t go crazy! PPrintee takes only clever decisions! It is endowed with intelligent feed-back functions which allow the user to understand and learn everything about the way it moves.Thanks to a real-time automatic feedback process, PPrintee auto-analyses every single action performed during a printing activity. It searches for the paper’s edges by driving itself on the printing surface. Then it finds the correct positioning for printing and afterwards it fulfils the printing task.  
Because fast printing and quality
printing, wherever you need them, are both equally important to you.
Because it’s small, it fits in your pocket
and it offers great printing features.
Because you like to be free. Because you
have ideas that must take shape as fast as possible, no matter your location.
Because you will most assuredly have new ideas and projects that you would not
possibly envisage without the PPrintee. 
Yes! It can print on every possible paper
format: from  stickers, business cards, envelopes, A4, A3, A2, A1, A0 to all
non-standard paper formats, such as long paper strips or large formats that are
usually printed by plotters. PPrintee has no limits; it works with all of them.You don’t even need to know exactly what
paper format you are using. PPrintee explores the paper’s edges and lets you
know the size of the paper that is going to be printed.
However, if you want to configure a
certain paper format, you can choose to do so from the printer’s menu or,
directly, from your phone via the PPrintee app. In this case, PPrintee simply
finds the right positioning for printing and it starts printing. 

Connect two or more PPrintees for the same
printing task. They will automatically sync and coordinate each other during
the entire printing activity.
PPrintee addicted and creative
professionals, PPrintee will make your day! It provides you with fast, high
quality printing wherever you are. When you see these wonderful machines at
work, you quickly understand that large and industrial printing has acquired a
new meaning. 

If you are a more conservative person or
you are still living the typewriters’ nostalgia, you’ll simply love PPrintee.
You can print as you type: word-by-word or row-by-row, depending on the way you
configure it. 
You type, and PPrintee prints. You stop
and it stops. You hesitate and PPrintee waits for you. You will experience the
great feeling of writing on the spot as if it were with a typewriter. 

More than all the above, PPrintee has a
screen that performs different tasks: it provides you with a printing’s
outcome, it plans its movements and it updates itself.
If it’s in stand-by and it’s connected to
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, it can show you your favorite news, time and weather or
your last Facebook news. Of course, you can configure all this manually, but
you can also give PPrintee the opportunity to choose them for you. 
PPrintee might also ask you questions and
start moving when it’s happy. And you’d better answer its questions, as you do
not intend to have an angry PPrintee nearby. 
If it’s turned on, but inactive for a long
period, PPrintee moves on the paper, it vibrates or it asks you politely to
print or go away. ☺ 
So don’t make PPrintee angry and don’t leave it
inactive …The result might be dramatically funny for you! Further steps: to develop and test
PPrintee’s full mechanics composed of wheels and mobile cylinders that can turn
at 360 degrees and allow the object to have different positions on the
surface it operates; and to integrate the scanning modules that assure the self-positioning
and the real-time feedback during printing.                                                                              
We imagined different ways to
print mobile and we designed a high-tech intelligent mobile printer that can
fit in your pocket.
We wanted to capture fast, mobile and
high-quality printing in one single device; and this is how we have come up
with PPrintee.
This is how it works. PPrintee moves on
paper, it searches for the paper’s edges, it positions; afterwards it starts
printing.  PPrintee analyses both its position in space and the printing surface. It is able to find the paper and to explore its format. It has two integrated scanning modules that assure a real-time synchronisation between the printing process and its movement on paper. These two scanning modules are PPrintee’s
eyes. They see, while the printer thinks. They send feedback during the entire
printing process and help PPrintee take decisions and correct its actions.
The print head moves fast enough to obtain
a high fluidity in printing the paper. Behind PPrintee’s fluid movements, there
is an advanced mechanics of wheels and mobile cylinders, both activated by
micro-engines.The wheels can make a 360 degrees turn and
they can also go out or retreat inside the cylinder. And this is how PPrintee
is able to lift or to lower its position.
In the searching paper position, the
wheels are largely outside the device, providing a flexible movement.
In the printing position, the wheels are
only a little bit outside the device, allowing the print head to smoothly touch
the paper and to coordinate the printing with the printer’s movement.PPrintee's ink cartridges are designed in such a way that they can be easily refilled and also environmentally friendly. For the monochrome prototype, they can last up to 200 pages. You will also find them on the market together with the serial production of PPrintees. PPrintee's team is passionate end enthusiastic about high technology. We all give value to innovative
and futuristic ideas. So far, we have received great feedback on this clever pocket printer from engineers and technological enthusiasts in US, France and Germany and, thus, we have already applied for an
international and US patent. We have also been offered partnership
opportunities from several local and international manufacturing companies. Therefore new partnerships are envisaged. 
Do you have a prototype? 
We are working on it.  We have tested important elements of the product design, as well as the mobility and the printing functionalities. We will use the funds to manufacture the final PPrintee Prototype, including the development of both its firmware and software, and to launch the serial production.
You will be able to see photos and videos of this whole process in our campaign's updates and on our website
www.pprintee.com. Join the PPrintee Community and share your ideas! 
Who are you? How did you come up with this idea? 
We are a team of enthusiastic creative
minds, engineers, technicians and entrepreneurs. One day in August 2013, as we
were discussing our professional needs, we came up with this wonderful idea: to
make printing mobile and thus open infinite possibilities for the printing
process in particular and visual arts in general.
How can I participate in this project? How can I join the PPrintee
Community?
You can support our project on Indiegogo.
We offer a lot of cool stuff in exchange of your contribution!
You can also support us by following our website
and the PPrintee Facebook Page, by telling your friends about our project and
by being in contact with other PPrintee Community Members. Please feel free to
exchange ideas with us and share your thoughts on PPrintee. We welcome any kind
of feed-back. Soon, we will print mobile. 
Does PPrintee print in color?  
Not yet. The first PPrintee will be a
monochrome one, printing only black & white. But be patient. We will also develop
the colour PPrintee.
Where can I buy a cartridge? How do I replace a cartridge?
PPrintee’s cartridges are environmentally
friendly ink cartridges, specially designed to be easily refilled or replaced. You can
buy them from us or from our retailers as soon as the PPrintee serial
production is on the market. 
How long will black & white cartridges last?
We are trying to fit a cartridge that
contains enough ink to print exactly like a desk inkjet printer. We have
estimated an approximate of 150 – 200 pages (A4) per cartridge. 
How can I print on several consecutive pages?
It depends on how you configure the
printer. PPrintee can both stop after each page and tell you to change the
paper or it can look for another blank page available near the already printed
one and continue the printing task.
When do you build the printer?
Check our timeline in order to find all the
necessary information. We hope to start manufacturing PPrintee within a year.
The campaign’s page and our website www.pprintee.com will keep you up to date
with the entire process.
Will you provide any warranty for the product?
We will observe all international and US
regulations.

When we designed PPrintee, we took in
consideration all its micro-parts and their exact placement inside and we will
do our best to make the product look and work exactly as we present it!
However, you need to be aware that changes
might occur during final tests or that some features might not be available right
away. The Engineering part is the toughest one. We will always keep you posted
on our advances and let you know how the final prototype will look like.Last but not least, we would really appreciate all your thoughts about the product, they way it looks as well as about its functionality. If you have some suggestions, don't hesitate to share them with us. Let's co-build PPrintee! 
In the near future, we take into consideration the development of a colour
printer  with an integrated scanner. Share your ideas with us and share this project. Speak about PPrintee and  support us on this journey.Let's build PPrintee together!Thank you!",52.0,2,"1 Campaign

PUBLIC  Journal seeks to provide a larger voice for the public interest design movement, which brings light to the issues of humanitarian design, social impact projects, and community-based design organizations who are all working to leave the world a better place.  
The exploration of the greater good is why we have committed to providing a platform for this growing movement to reach a greater PUBLIC.

  The Impact PUBLIC Journal reaches thousands of members within professional organizations such as the American Institute of Architect, the American Institute of Graphic Artists, and the American Institute of Architecture Students. We believe designers can have a great impact on the world, and here are some ideas how PUBLIC Journal can help: 
Tens of thousands of designers graduate from college every year and PUBLIC Journal desires to be a voice to help influence the emerging professionals. Over 100,000 professionals have the opportunity to learn how others are designing and helping nonprofits around the world. Nonprofits and NGOs have the opportunity to voice their needs, desires, and accomplishments in order to help them expand their work for those in need around the world. 




  Risks & Challenges  Our team at PUBLIC Journal has self published Issue 1 & 2 with very little support. We currently have limited funds and need financial support in order to publish Issue 3. The publication of Issue 3 is a critical milestone for PUBLIC Journal to establish credibility with advertisers and corporate sponsors. The potential for this journal is great, and our readership could soon reach over 80,000 people with key distribution through professional design networks.

This high-quality 3D laser scanning software offers a low-cost solution for mobile scanning.<br/></strong><br/>Since 2009 under continuous development the new 3D laser scanning software <b>InOSS</b><i><b> </b></i>enables users to generate detailed point clouds by using a G-Code based 3D printer and a mobile camera-laser-module.<br/><br/><p><b>What makes InOSS so special?</b> Currently most commercial 3D scanning devices are desktop scanners. In contrast, the new scanning software <b>InOSS </b>offers the possibility to scan also bigger objects from various perspectives and at different distances. This is due to the very versatile and flexibly usable hardware consisting of scan unit (camera-laser-module) and separate scan axis. The data generated by <b>InOSS</b> can be further processed by third-party software for CAD or reproduction.<br/></p><p>Another big benefit of the product is that the scan unit has to be calibrated only <b>once!</b> After that, no further calibration is necessary. Therefore the product represents a real innovation for technology enthusiasts. The alpha version is currently being revised and will soon be available as version 0.3.0.<br/></p><p><b>This is how scanning works:</b></p><p><b></b> </p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FTBa3VBZ7bwA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DTBa3VBZ7bwA&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FTBa3VBZ7bwA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<b>""Do it yourself"" - simple assembly of the scan unit. </b>The flexibly usable scan unit consists of a standard webcam and laser. These two components can be easily assembled by yourself. The calibration of the unit has only to be done <b>once!</b> (see calibration instructions below).

</strong></em></div>","The new innovation for technology enthusiasts. This high-quality 3D laser scanning software offers a low-cost solution for mobile scanning.Since 2009 under continuous development the new 3D laser scanning software InOSS enables users to generate detailed point clouds by using a G-Code based 3D printer and a mobile camera-laser-module.What makes InOSS so special? Currently most commercial 3D scanning devices are desktop scanners. In contrast, the new scanning software InOSS offers the possibility to scan also bigger objects from various perspectives and at different distances. This is due to the very versatile and flexibly usable hardware consisting of scan unit (camera-laser-module) and separate scan axis. The data generated by InOSS can be further processed by third-party software for CAD or reproduction.Another big benefit of the product is that the scan unit has to be calibrated only once! After that, no further calibration is necessary. Therefore the product represents a real innovation for technology enthusiasts. The alpha version is currently being revised and will soon be available as version 0.3.0.This is how scanning works: 
""Do it yourself"" - simple assembly of the scan unit. The flexibly usable scan unit consists of a standard webcam and laser. These two components can be easily assembled by yourself. The calibration of the unit has only to be done once! (see calibration instructions below). After having finished assembly the unit can be directly installed to the 3D printer or to the separate axis. If it is installed to the printer it goes without saying the the size of the objects to be scanned depends on the capacity of the printer. Another convenient feature  is the fact that the scan unit as well as the axis can be produced by 3D printing.The according CAD data will be provided.This is how assembly of the scan unit works: Latest results. The current alpha version 0.2.1 already enables the user to completely scan objects and to generate a detailed point cloud.Integrated interfaces to the processing software MeshLab allow an efficient further processing of the point cloud, e.g. align (manual registration).

Analog phones are also cheap, and anybody can use it, so it's also good to share with others, to use as a remote in your house or in the office to control IoT devices and web services.IoT機器の多くはスマホのアプリで操作することができます。また最近ではスマートスピーカーでも多くの操作ができるようになりました。しかしアプリの場合は、スマホの中にある多くのアプリの中から、使いたいアプリを探して、それを立ち上げ、そしてそれからアプリを操作しなくてはなりません。また自分のスマホに接続された機器を他の人が操作した場合には、自分のスマホを相手に手渡さなくてはいけません。スマートスピーカーも便利な反面、わざわざ話さないといけないのが億劫な場面もあります。hackfonなら、ボタンを押したり、ダイヤルするだけ。またアナログ電話は安価で販売されており、お年寄りから子供まで誰でも簡単に扱うことができます。家庭やオフィスなどでIoT機器や、ウェブサービスを操作するリモコンとして共有するのに向いています。Amazon Made a Device to Turn to a Phone, We Do Reverseアマゾンは電話になるIoT機器を作りましたが、私たちは逆をします Amazon had announced a new echo device in Oct. 2017. The product named ""echo connect"" turns your Echo into a voice-controlled speakerphone. We do the reverse. We are turning analog phones to the latest smart devices.There are always some trends in technology. Products tend to evolve along those trends but there are always different options and other possibilities to the development of new products. We are working to seek one of another possibility for technology evolvement with this product. And, you can utilize your old phone! If you have a nice design analog phone, it's a chance to revive it.アマゾンは2017年10月にecho connectという新商品を発表しました。これはアマゾン社のEchoを音声コントロールできるスピーカーホンに変えてしまうというデバイス。私たちは逆に、アナログ電話をスマートデバイスへと変えます。技術にはいつもトレンドが存在します。最近のスマートホンやスマートスピーカーにみられるように、そうした傾向にそって、製品は進化していく傾向があります。ですが、テクノロジーには常に他の可能性や進化の可能性もあります。私たちは、そうした他には手がけていなけれど存在する別のテクノロジーの進化の道を模索してみたい、と考えこの製品を手がけました。もし自宅に有効活用されていない古い電話機をお持ちでしたら、それを再活用するチャンスです。キャラクター電話や、素敵なデザインの電話機があれば、それを生き返らせてみましょう。Making from Small Quantities少量から生産をします(Inside the factory of Jenesis corporation in ShenZhen, China) We don't know how many backs we will get by this campaign. We are thinking to start small, but if we get backs more than we expected, we may use a factory in ShenZhen, China. One of our company advisors is running a factory in ShenZhen, China, and doing hard quality check with Japanese standard.If we get only few number of backs, don't worry, we will make them. Instead of making a high leap toward a big target, we just decided to make a smaller milestone below it since we had seen many struggles among hardware startups.どのくらいの数の支援をいただけるかわかりませんが、私たちが想定していたよりも多くの支援を頂いた場合、中国の深センの工場での生産を予定してます。私たちの会社のアドバイザーにもなっていただいている日本人経営の中国の工場にて、高い品質管理の水準によって生産を行うことを考えています。もし想定よりも少ない数の支援しかいただけなかった場合でも心配ありません。私たちが自ら生産を行います。高いターゲットのゴールを設定し、そこに向けて背伸びをしようとするよりも、今回はこのような形で小さなチャレンジを行うことにしました（そして世界各地でいろいろなハードウェアスタートアップが苦労しているのも目の当たりにして、このような試みで今回は始めてみることにしました）Media Coverage | メディア掲載歴fabcross.jp""hackfonは、日本発のMOTTAINAI精神を実践すると同時に、スマートフォン操作の苦手な人が陥りがちなデジタルデバイド（情報格差）を解消するデバイスと言えるだろう""",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

For every 1 € donated, edinn will donate 1 € morein work time and licenses!

All our users, without exception, have reported a minimum of a 10% increase in their total efficiency, after 1 year of using the edinn system. 
Can you imagine how much money that is for the user, and how many tons of CO2 we are avoiding to emit?
With your donations, we will provide these benefits for free, to small and medium companies which can not afford the edinn system, to help them save their jobs, improve their economical strength and the environment.
There will be an impartial selection process, where all donors will vote which company to help and will receive a document with the results and their ""thank you"".










What is edinn?
Edinn is a web based software that helps any organization to achieve its maximum efficiency. 



It is really effective because it:


Monitors every person and machine.

Shows 100% detail of their inefficiencies, with certainty, in an easy, powerful and robust way.

Includes the main tools to reduce inefficiencies.


Total efficiency includes energy efficiency, but it is from 3, 10 or more times more protifable and beneficial for the environment than energy efficiency alone. To understand this, think on how inefficient it is to produce a product or service that is discarded because of a quality problem.
           



edinn is Affiliate Partner of EU's Climate KIC organization, the official tool of the Valencian Ford Automobile Cluster and of the Chilean National Exporters Association.
Edinn has been chosen by SMEs and multinationals from different countries, after comparing it with other solutions, and all of our users withouth exception have reported from 10% to 40% increase in their total efficiency, after 1 year of use.



Can you imagine the positive impact on the world's economy and environment, if every organization could see its inefficiencies in real time, with certainty, and 100% detail?

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<div>
</div>
<p>This is Appbot Riley's first product launch on Indiegogo, but not our first product launch. We've already developed, launched, and delivered a successful Appbot V1 through traditional eCommerce like Amazon. Based on the feedback from our existing customers - we believe that the Indiegogo platform is well suited to provide us with input and feedback for our next design. We've answered all the improvements in our Appbot Riley design from the first version, and are looking toward Indiegogo to help us create the perfect Riley. With that in mind, some specifications may still change later in the campaign. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We estimate deliveries to begin in July 2016 and we will do our best to meet this deadline. If we encounter any delays, we will always make sure that we share this news with you.</p>

And to be honest we have spend already bit more than we wanted on the development of this product as we also had a Beta Run of the product which is the black acrylic version which we made 8 high quality versions of and asked people to come and test them and also gave a set to them as gift. And as feedback we were able to develop them even further, as we didn't only asked professionals but also start ups and students. And the reason we choose Indiegogo over other crow funding websites, is that we found it more reasonable feature and also make it more accessible for most people around the world as you can pay with Paypal.</p><p><span><b>You are using Flexible Funding will you be able to produce the products even when not reaching your goal?</b></span></p><p>We will still be able to produce when even when not hitting the goal, however we do feel that we will be able to hit our goal and go over it. To be honest our goal of €3000 is set so we have a continues running production, however at 1000 we can already do a break even production, this means we will be able to produce,send the products and pay VAT. But means we will not have money to continue the next run and produce more. So our first real goal is to at least reach over €1000, however when we hit €3000 we will directly start producing meaning they will be able send out the products much faster and much earlier, as the Flexible Funding makes this possible.</p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Are you taking orders internationally?</b><br/></p><p><span>Yes, we are taking international orders, international shipping outside of Europe will cost €5 the perk of 4 sets and more.

These are the rules, we don't like it either as 21% of €20 is already €4.20 that goes directly to the VAT. However we included the VAT in the pricing so you directly know how much it is.</p><p><b>Will Kabuto Focus make it more stable for handheld use?</b></p><p>To be honest no, also claims from other Focus Levers on the market are bringing out false claims about this and we rather give you the truth. The main thing is that the Kabuto Focus is a focussing assist tool that help you with focussing and rack focussing.

Why use Kabuto Focus?Kabuto Focus is a tool to extend your creativity adding extra abilities to you camera.

Rack Focus to change focus between several object with preset markers as guides.


Rack Zoom to change the framing of the shot with preset markers as guides.

Extending the reach of the focus enabling you to control the focus while using both hands to hold the camera steady.

Safe Time by preset markers before a Live shows, Concerts, Presentations and more. So when you film you don't have to search for focus or framing and able to swiftly change focus or zoom without having to miss your mark or important moments.

Kabuto Focus. Marking ease of Focus.What is Kabuto Focus?Kabuto Focus is a stand-alone follow focus lever and focus marker board that can be used on almost any camera lens, with its own unique features: 

Easy in use because of the concave top, enabling one finger control.

Visible markers from behind the camera.

Stealthy transparent design making it unnoticeable from a distance.

Fit any size lens from large Cine lenses to the smallest C-mount lenses.

Transparent design enabling using the marker board on both sides.

No extra rig required.

Super lightweight and will not rotate the focus or zoom ring due to its weight.

Customisable Sensu Marker as we will provide an online pdf template to make your own.

DIY fixing by making own laminated marker board  and rubber band are easily replaceable with household ones.
PerksWith your help we will be able to make the Kabuto Focus available for €20, making it affordable for the masses.Kabuto Focus No Marker €15
Kabuto Focus Lever, made from 5mm thick Transparent Acrylic.
Sensu Marker Base, made from 5mm thick Transparent Acrylic.
Two Pairs of UV resistant 4mm black rubber bands in sizes 85mm & 130mm.
2x Transparent Acrylic square loops for the rubber bands.
Link to download the Sensu Marker PDF to customise, print and make your own Paper Sensu Marker.
Why no Marker? Because we can show you how to make a laminated or out of thin transparent plastic and just cutting it with scissors. But you only have to spend €1 or €2 but you can make 9 of them with that budget, out of one A4 sheet. Plus if we would produce these the price be much higher almost double or triple cause of the manual labour and the die cut mould.Kabuto Focus €20
Kabuto Focus Lever, made from 5mm thick Transparent Acrylic.
Sensu Marker Base, made from 5mm thick Transparent Acrylic.
Sensu marker, made from 1mm Transparent PETG.
Two Pairs of UV resistant 4mm black rubber bands in sizes 85mm & 130mm.
2x Transparent Acrylic square loops for the rubber bands.

You might think why are these cheaper, mainly sending it all to one address the shipping cost will also be to one address, instead of multiple addresses in loose packages.The Kabuto Focus also works great in combination with a top handle enable single hand control and holding the camera, so you can shoot very low angle shots and easily use one thumb to focus and its the only product which can do this.Help & Share!
Even if you like the Kabuto Focus and see potential of it helping other filmmakers, but it doesn't fit your workflow, you can still help us and other filmmakers by sharing this Indiegogo. Please share this IndieGoGo project with the share tools above to Facebook, Twitter or Google+ and we greatly appreciate your help and share.More detailed infoThe name Kabuto Focus is actually derived from the Japanese Rhinoceros Beetle the Kabutomushi as their horn has a similar shape to our Kabuto Focus. And inspired by the beetle we were able to ad couple of features which overall improved the design. As the shape of the top now enable you to also control the Kabuto Focus using one finger and with certain rigs you can still hold the camera steady with both hands instead of freeing one to one use for focussing.We made the Kabuto Focus to possible to mount almost any lens and even small C-mount lenses. The reason for this, is that M4/3 camera's like the Panasonic, Olympus, Black Magic Cinema Pocket and the Digital Bolex can use these small lenses, but there weren't any working follow focus that fits on these small lenses. To attach it on these small lenses, use the small rubber band and wrap it extra around the inner hooks to increase the tension to increase the grip.The reason we have chosen for transparent instead of black or being colourful, is that the transparency gives it an additional function of able to use the Sensu focus marker on both sides. As we found out that on older lenses often there isn't enough space behind the focus ring, yet often have space in front of the ring.The Sensu Marker is based on the Sensu Fan which is a foldable fan from Asia.

<p>With bricks that can be triggered by sound, light, touch and the entire world of IoT, there isn’t much you CAN’T do. You can set your phone's alarm clock to only shut off when you build a pyramid. Or you make a treat dispenser that gives your pup a treat every time he goes to his crate when there’s a knock at the door. Or help your kid build a nightlight that turns on when he says ""heebeejeebee"".  And that’s just what our crew did, you’ve probably got a few ideas of your own.</p>
<p>You can even use it to replace high end automated IoT processes, like setting your Nest profile and turning on all your smart home devices just by hanging up a BRIXO keychain on a BRIXO board by the door.  The possibilities are pretty much endless.</p>

<p>BRIXO chrome-coated connector blocks conduct electricity. Their unique design enables adjacent bricks to conduct currents in any direction via patented small elastic arms.  </p>
<p>BRIXO’s smart internal 9V battery block powers your creations and constantly monitors their currents so you don’t have to worry about short circuits. A built-in Bluetooth controller will let you change the current’s direction and voltage levels via our mobile application. The smart battery will also detect when you're not using BRIXO and conserve power to extend battery life.</p>
<p>BRIXO trigger blocks are designed to control the action without additional wiring. Connected along the current path, they switch action blocks “on” and “off” using built-in light, sound and proximity sensors. The trigger blocks’ smart switching functionality operates the action blocks by controlling the current in the circuit.</p>

I quickly realized he couldn’t see it through the forest of tangled wires on his breadboard. Not a moment later, he went back to playing with his favorite toy, Lego®, and the idea for BRIXO revealed itself. At first we tried to embed wires into existing blocks, but quickly understood two important things: the blocks must be simple (no wires inside!) and fully compatible with standard building blocks. As physicists, we deal with thin films all day long, so the solution to use a conductive chrome coating was right in front of our eyes.

</div></div>","BRIXO's electric bricks are normal sized building blocks that are anything but normal. It's like Lego® on steroids, if steroids also gave you superpowers and taught you new languages. 
Basically, they're bricks that safely conduct electricity and connect to your phone to enable you to do all sorts of cool things with your designs.  And no, you don't need to buy a whole new set, because they're used interchangeably with your favourite building blocks to add an element of interactive awesomeness. 
 BRIXO bricks include LED lights, motor blocks and even sound, light and proximity sensors. They’re powered by a low voltage Bluetooth controlled built-in battery brick and coated in chrome, a non-toxic metal, to ensure your safety.
 


 

 




 
 

 
 

 



 

With bricks that can be triggered by sound, light, touch and the entire world of IoT, there isn’t much you CAN’T do. You can set your phone's alarm clock to only shut off when you build a pyramid. Or you make a treat dispenser that gives your pup a treat every time he goes to his crate when there’s a knock at the door. Or help your kid build a nightlight that turns on when he says ""heebeejeebee"".  And that’s just what our crew did, you’ve probably got a few ideas of your own.
You can even use it to replace high end automated IoT processes, like setting your Nest profile and turning on all your smart home devices just by hanging up a BRIXO keychain on a BRIXO board by the door.  The possibilities are pretty much endless.
 
 

 There are 3 types of bricks:


 


 

 These blocks are chrome and connect the trigger blocks to the action blocks. So yes, your designs will be riding on chrome.

 


Trigger blocks are the ones that are set to respond with an action to sounds, lights, or having another brick in its proximity. Oh yeah, and with a bit of technical know-how, you can even set it to be triggered by pretty much anything using IoT and IFTTT.


 


 


 This is where the magic happens. As you can probably guess, these are the blocks that do stuff, really cool stuff. The go-getters. Set your action blocks to light up, spin, move, and take action.

The International Prototype Kilogram was first created in 1889 and is kept under lock and key in a vault in Paris. Scientists have long treated it with the reverence it deserves. They dare not touch it, knowing that it is a highly volatile, yet beautiful representation of weight. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558403890/lp0qrjlsbk1fd64wlcle.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Despite being made from platinum and iridium, it is known that even the smallest movements and wear can result in tiny imperfections in the weight measure. That is why, in a highly emotional vote, scientists chose to use an alternative standard measurement - universal constants that remain unchanged, regardless of where they are in time and space. As of today, 20 May 2019, the IPK is being retired… an event that deserves recognition.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559531284/hpdfdy26hwrnfgab88yl.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>The Official International Prototype Kilogram, manufactured in 1889, and carefully stored in Saint-Cloud, Paris</i></p><p>Here at DeskTech we cannot see such a momentous day go unnoticed and so we have developed our own version of the Kilogram Prototype - designed to offer you a piece of history, a conversation starter and a perfect example of how even things we believe to be constant, are ever changing.   </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558403997/ca8iakw2sbm61xzs6mam.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>'WTF why is it so heavy!?' - Power of Tungsten </h3><p>Creating our own Kilogram Prototype took many months of careful development.

<li>Refinement - The Kilogram Prototype starts life as trace elements in ores, which are then refined through multiple steps into tungsten oxide. From here the tungsten oxide is baked in a hydrogen atmosphere to create pure tungsten powder. </li>
<li>Pressing - The tungsten powder is sifted and added into a giant steel press. The powder is compacted under immense pressure of 60 tons per square inch into a cohesive, yet still fragile bar.</li>
<li>Pre-Sintering - The compacted fragile bar is then loaded into an extremely high temperature furnace causing the material to consolidate to roughly 70% of its full density.</li>
<li>Full Sintering - The bar is now loaded into a special water-cooled treating bottle. Electric current is passed through the bar and the heat generated by this will cause the bar to densify to about 85% to 95% of full density causing it to shrink by roughly 15%.</li>
<li>Swaging - The rod is then heated to 1500oC and passed through a swager die, which is designed to hammer the rod at about 10,000 blows per minute, reducing it’s diameter to nearly the required size.</li>
<li>Machining - The rods are then reheated and placed into a CNC lathe and CVD diamond coated tools cut the cylinder to the exact required dimensions and the multiple chamfered edges are applied.</li>
<li>Nickel Plating - The Tungsten cylinders are then chemically cleaned and sent for electroless nickel plating, providing a high-quality corrosion-resistant layer.</li>
<li>Polishing - Each cylinder is polished using several different buffing wheels and polishing paste, with the surface finish being refined more with each pass. </li>
<li>Laser Engraving - Laser engraving is used to ensure all the details on the top surface appear detailed and crisp.</li>
<li>Quality Control - Each cylinder is then carefully inspected for any blemishes before being sent for assembly.  </li>

The International Prototype Kilogram was first created in 1889 and is kept under lock and key in a vault in Paris. Scientists have long treated it with the reverence it deserves. They dare not touch it, knowing that it is a highly volatile, yet beautiful representation of weight. Despite being made from platinum and iridium, it is known that even the smallest movements and wear can result in tiny imperfections in the weight measure. That is why, in a highly emotional vote, scientists chose to use an alternative standard measurement - universal constants that remain unchanged, regardless of where they are in time and space. As of today, 20 May 2019, the IPK is being retired… an event that deserves recognition.  The Official International Prototype Kilogram, manufactured in 1889, and carefully stored in Saint-Cloud, ParisHere at DeskTech we cannot see such a momentous day go unnoticed and so we have developed our own version of the Kilogram Prototype - designed to offer you a piece of history, a conversation starter and a perfect example of how even things we believe to be constant, are ever changing.    'WTF why is it so heavy!?' - Power of Tungsten Creating our own Kilogram Prototype took many months of careful development. We needed it to have the shine and polish of the original alongside the required durability and density, but at a lower cost.
Tungsten was the perfect choice, it's one of the most dense materials commercially available, even more dense than Uranium.
You will most likely never encounter anything this size that weighs this much.
It's the ultimate conversation starter, people will be blown away by how heavy it is.
Tungsten is an extremely rare element with just 100 parts per billion contained within the Earth’s crust. It has the highest melting point of any metal at 3,410° C (6,170° F) and as such, it is an incredibly difficult metal to process and work with. However its ability to withstand high levels of compression and heat have made it an ideal alloy for rocket engine nozzles, radiation shielding and aerospace tooling. DeskTech: Kilogram Prototype - a gift for all This is a gift that will last a lifetime. Crafted from one of the densest and hardest materials on the planet, these cylinders are beautiful and perfect for anyone who has an interest in STEM (Science Technology Engineering Mathematics). Ideal as a conversation starter in the office or maybe as a corporate gift that will be treasured and given pride of place. Students, scientists, mathematicians, engineers and creatives will all admire the work that has gone into this sturdy design-led piece and will find themselves wanting to pick it up. When they do, they will be amazed at how heavy, dense and solid it feels. One Kilogram Two StylesWe offer two choices of the Kilogram Prototype to suit your requirements. Each uses all of the same materials and techniques, but provide a different look depending on your decor and style.   Left: Kilogram Prototype - Classic | Right: Kilogram Prototype - ContemporarySize Comparison - Left: Kilogram Prototype - Contemporary | Right: Kilogram Prototype - ClassicA Homage to the Original International KilogramNational prototype kilogram K20, one of two prototypes stored at the US National Institute of Standards and TechnologyTo the naked eye, our Kilogram Prototype is your very own piece of scientific history. It is the purest example of measurement and an historic homage that truly delivers in terms of beauty and interest. As a desk accessory, it is sublime.  While we could never hope to completely recreate the beauty of the original International Kilogram Prototype, as it was built using a platinum-iridium alloy and cost many hundreds of thousands of dollars. However, with modern techniques, we have been able to reproduce its polished sheen using specialist nickel plating. We achieved the density of the metal with Tungsten, giving it almost exactly the same dimensions as the original. We took our inspiration for the chamfers on the piece from the original four angles (22.5°, 45°, 67.5° and 79°) , giving the item a level of detail that will impress.  DeskTech: Kilogram Prototype – Classic If you wish to be inspired by science and to reflect on the great scientific masters while at your desk, this classic version is for you. Heavily influenced by the original International Prototype Kilogram, this features a machined and anodized aluminium base, upon which the Kilogram Prototype rests. A custom-made glass bell jar protects the cylinder and gives it a laboratory-like feel, but with pure beauty and elegance. All parts are carefully considered and fit each other with precision - just like the Kilogram weight itself.   DeskTech: Kilogram Prototype – Contemporary The minimalist style of this contemporary version cannot be understated. With a sleek profile, the Kilogram weight sits upon a machined and anodized aluminium base with a mirror finish logo. This open display allows you to interact with the cylinder - pick it up, marvel at the weight and smooth finish. Unlike the original, this Kilogram Prototype is designed to be played with, not just admired.  The RewardsHow we made the Kilogram PrototypeTungsten requires some of the most specialist refinement and production processes of any metal, due to its incredibly high melting point and hardness. Outlined below are the key steps taken by our highly skilled craftspeople as they create a DeskTech Kilogram Prototype.  The production process:
Refinement - The Kilogram Prototype starts life as trace elements in ores, which are then refined through multiple steps into tungsten oxide. From here the tungsten oxide is baked in a hydrogen atmosphere to create pure tungsten powder. 
Pressing - The tungsten powder is sifted and added into a giant steel press. The powder is compacted under immense pressure of 60 tons per square inch into a cohesive, yet still fragile bar.
Pre-Sintering - The compacted fragile bar is then loaded into an extremely high temperature furnace causing the material to consolidate to roughly 70% of its full density.
Full Sintering - The bar is now loaded into a special water-cooled treating bottle. Electric current is passed through the bar and the heat generated by this will cause the bar to densify to about 85% to 95% of full density causing it to shrink by roughly 15%.
Swaging - The rod is then heated to 1500oC and passed through a swager die, which is designed to hammer the rod at about 10,000 blows per minute, reducing it’s diameter to nearly the required size.
Machining - The rods are then reheated and placed into a CNC lathe and CVD diamond coated tools cut the cylinder to the exact required dimensions and the multiple chamfered edges are applied.
Nickel Plating - The Tungsten cylinders are then chemically cleaned and sent for electroless nickel plating, providing a high-quality corrosion-resistant layer.
Polishing - Each cylinder is polished using several different buffing wheels and polishing paste, with the surface finish being refined more with each pass. 
Laser Engraving - Laser engraving is used to ensure all the details on the top surface appear detailed and crisp.
Quality Control - Each cylinder is then carefully inspected for any blemishes before being sent for assembly.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Over our 4.5 years in Korea, we've built an audience of over 312,000 subscribers who are interested in Korean life, food, and culture. Many want to learn Korean as well. While there are plenty of resources out there, there's no ONE place where you can learn everything you need to know, presented by native speakers, and taught the language in its most natural spoken form, so you don't end up speaking like a walking textbook.</p>
<p>A big problem with most language education resources is that they end up teaching you things you'll rarely, if EVER, come across in life. That's a lot of wasted brain space and time. We've built this to be an actual practical and efficient way of learning Korean; no more lists of rarely-ever-used vocabulary, no more learning obscure grammar that comes up once in a blue moon, and no more learning about topics that you have absolutely no interest in.</p>
<p>While some companies focus on the app, they don't give you the learning materials for those who prefer pen and paper. Others may give you videos but no way to test you actually learned anything. Are you an audiophile? Maybe you want to listen on your way to work, at the gym, or while you sleep?</p>
<p>Imagine getting ALL of this in one place. With some topics and phrases that are essential for adult life that these other companies are too scared to teach you!</p>
<p>Welcome to <strong>Korean Lesson Time</strong>, the most comprehensive and insanely practical way of learning Korean, ever.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To get everything we need for our MVP to be complete we need:</p>
<ul><li>At least <strong>ONE</strong> highly skilled developer to build the customer account system which deals with the purchase history of courses, course completion statistics, refinements to the game, and enabling some harder to code features in the app.</li></ul>
<p>If we exceed our goal we can :</p>
<ul>
<li>hire more developers to get the product launched quicker</li>
<li>get additional upgrades to graphics, music, and sound effects</li>
<li>work on more varied game modes for practicing and testing knowledge</li>
<li>add extra features we might discover during the building process</li>
</ul>
<p>Some rewards for you lovely backers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Special Character sets ONLY for campaign supporters</li>
<li>Discounts on all courses available at launch*</li>
<li>Your name credited in our Hall of Fame</li>
<li>Every course free forever**</li>
<li>Your character in the game**</li>
</ul>
<p><i>*see tiers for more details</i></p>
<p><i>**limited to very exclusive backers</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Can't Do It Alone</h3>
<p>We've been working on this project since mid January. What started as a small conversation about how we could give better teaching resources with our in-video Korean Lesson Times has blossomed into a fully fledged learning experience. Xander even started to learn how to code for the app development side but some features are too complicated for him at this stage. It's taken so much of our time that we've been neglecting our YouTube channel by uploading less frequently.</p>
<ul>
<li>By hiring an experienced developer (or multiple) we can assure the app is stable and secure</li>
<li>Being able to pay our Korean voice actors more for their time and input (it's at least 42 hours of recording for the planned courses! - Yikes!)</li>
<li>A bigger team can share more of the work and we can finish the products quicker!</li>
</ul>
<p>Your contributions, big or small, will aid in the construction of this project. The more we can raise the more people we can hire to get this done quicker.</p>
<p>If we <strong>can't </strong>get the full goal amount it's ok, we'll keep working on the project and we'll release as soon as the system and app work smoothly with no problems.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate, we totally understand. We hope, at least, you could ask others to help us out with this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liking the Campaign Launch video on YouTube</li>
<li>Sharing this page on Facebook and Twitter.</li>
<li>​Go to a Korean study gorup? Tell them about it </li>
<li>If your friends and family like us, ask them!</li>
</ul>
<p>Help us spread the word so we can get all the materials finished quicker and to a hopefully even better quality standard :)</p>
<h3>Basic Bundle (Retail $50)</h3>
<p>The Basic Bundle consists of <strong>Korean Lesson Time: Korean Alphabet</strong>, <strong>Korean Lesson Time: Korean Numbers</strong>, and <strong>Korean Lesson Time: Korean Grammar </strong>and is <strong>16%</strong> cheaper than buying them separately.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Korean Lesson Time: Korean Alphabet (Retail $15)</strong><br/>You can't start learning if you don't know your alphabet! The Korean alphabet consists of 40 characters, some of which are pronounced with sounds that don't exist in English. But don't worry, Korean Lesson Time will have plenty of examples of how they're supposed to sound and how to produce the sounds even if you've only grown up with English.<br/><br/>This Korean Lesson Time will include an extensive PDF, audiobook form, videos describing each letter, its pronunciation and how to produce it, and its corresponding game modes in the App.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Korean Lesson Time: Korean Numbers (Retail $15)</strong><br/>So much of life depends on being able to count: buying stuff, telling time, being with people, and expressing the order of things. Korean has two number systems, which will both be thoroughly explained in this Korean Lesson Time. <br/><br/>This Korean Lesson Time will include an extensive PDF, audiobook form, videos describing each number, its pronunciation and how to produce it, and its corresponding game modes in the App.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Korean Lesson Time: Korean Grammar (Retail $30)</strong><br/>Instead of teaching bits and pieces of grammar over and over again in every future Topic-Based Korean Lesson Time, which would seem like a huge redundancy in what you're paying for and would take much longer to produce, We Fancy has decided to make what is basically a Korean Grammar Index.<br/><br/>In this KLT, we've provided the most commonly used grammar in day-to-day life. We've explained how they should be used colloquially (natural native spoken style) so you don't sound like a walking textbook. This KLT was designed to be a reference source for your journey to Korean fluency and is meant to be read and repeated over and over again as you come across unfamiliar grammar in your life or in the Topic-Based Korean Lesson Times. With the grammar in this KLT, you should be able to navigate perfectly through your day-to-day needs. Once mastered, your Korean proficiency level will be high enough to self-learn everything else through immersion (going to Korea, hanging out with Koreans in your city, watching Korean movies and dramas with or without subtitles, etc.) or advanced studies.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Topic-Based Korean Lesson Times</h3>
<p>The current vision for the complete Korean Lesson Time series is to have 18 more topic-based Korean Lesson Times released. These will not only be language lessons but also include etiquette, social norms, and guides where relevant. As of now, the planned topics will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><i>Restaurants &amp; Food</i></strong><br/>Everything about food from what to do in a restaurant, to dishes, to ingredients, to table manners and paying bills.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Transportation </strong></i><br/>Getting from the airport to anywhere else in Korea. AREX, KTX, train, subway, bus, taxi, beyond taxis, rentals, how to ask for, understand, and give directions, etc.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Self-Introduction</strong></i><br/>Name, age, physical stats, where you're from, your childhood, personality, family, education, career, dreams, hobbies, likes and dislikes, etc.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Making Friends</strong></i><br/>How to make friends, social protocols, suggesting hangouts, social culture, informal speech patterns and slang, special texting language, etc.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Dating</strong></i><br/>Where to meet people, how to initiate conversation, manners, behaviors, dating culture, expectations, cultural differences, etc.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Drinking Games</strong></i><br/>This you'll only be able to learn by actually going to post-secondary school in Korea. A comprehensive index of Korean drinking games, the chants that go with them, and overall drinking culture.</li>
<li>
<strong><i>Sex &amp; More </i></strong><br/>Every filthy thing you want to say from Netflix and Chill to euphemisms for genitals to fetishes, all in Korean. Also, anything related to sexual health: STDs, contraceptives, body parts, bodily fluids and functions, etc. </li>
<li>
<strong><i>Bad Words </i></strong><br/>Insults, swear words, racist and sexist words... for education of course. You'd want to know when someone was using them at you, right?</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Hotels &amp; More</strong></i><br/>Accommodation-types, costs, reservations, domestic traveling/holidaying/road-trips, etc.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Getting Your Own Place</strong></i><br/>How to find your own place, what the different types of properties are, how to measure rooms, how to ask about amenities and what's included in the room, how to call movers and what services they provide, how to negotiate prices, how to break or cancel contracts, garbage disposal, recycling, etc.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Health &amp; Hospitals</strong></i><br/>Sicknesses, diseases, health and hospital culture, medicines, corrective surgery, glasses, dentistry, etc.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Plastic Surgery</strong></i> <br/>If you're looking to fix something surgically, everything you need to know from pricing, payment, types of surgery, and what can be changed.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Beauty</strong></i><br/>Cosmetics, skincare, hair styling and everything related to hair salons, fashion, nails, etc.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Shopping</strong></i><br/>Spending money, negotiating prices, where to buy what, store types, payment methods, reward systems, delivery, etc.</li>

<i><strong>Fitness</strong></i> <br/>Working out, body parts, sports, athletics, gym memberships, negotiation memberships, diets, etc.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Emergencies</strong></i><br/>Anything related to if you're suddenly in trouble, car-related, traffic related, police, fire, medical, work, etc.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Daily Life</strong></i><br/>All the miscellaneous things that make up one's daily life like banking, phone plans, taxes, insurance, getting a vehicle and the right licenses, visas, dealing with difficult people, etc.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Celebrations</strong></i><br/>National holidays, general holidays, break times, special celebration events, moments, and occasions, expected manners and behaviors, gift giving, gift receiving, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>After getting some feedback from our surveys, we may also develop proficiency-levels within those topics to create a more easily consumable structure.</p>
<p>Pricing will vary between the courses depending on how much information and how useful we believe they will be for you guys.</p>
<p>Every single one of these Topic-Based Korean Lesson Times will include PDFs, audiobook form, videos, and their corresponding App features.</p>
<p>Of course, these may be subject to change, but change will be positive and include more value for you guys, never less.</p>
<h3>Ultimate Future Vision: XYZ Lesson Time &amp; Localization</h3>
<p>Ultimately, we intend for ""Lesson Time"" to be a huge education brand. Under one super powerful app, we'll be branching out to every major language. From there, we'd go into pre-secondary subjects like Mathematics, Sciences, History, etc. Beyond that, we see advanced, post-secondary topics such as Calculus, Advanced Sciences, Engineering, Philosophy, Literature, etc. </p>
<p>All of this is using English as a starting point, but what if English isn't your native language? Well, ultimately, we'd localize all our material so that a user can pick their native tongue and learn everything, including English, using their native language!</p>
<p>One day, with your help and support, we hope to be the leading global education resource with a brand that is synonymous with practical, fun, and actually effective.</p>

A big problem with most language education resources is that they end up teaching you things you'll rarely, if EVER, come across in life. That's a lot of wasted brain space and time. We've built this to be an actual practical and efficient way of learning Korean; no more lists of rarely-ever-used vocabulary, no more learning obscure grammar that comes up once in a blue moon, and no more learning about topics that you have absolutely no interest in.
While some companies focus on the app, they don't give you the learning materials for those who prefer pen and paper. Others may give you videos but no way to test you actually learned anything. Are you an audiophile? Maybe you want to listen on your way to work, at the gym, or while you sleep?
Imagine getting ALL of this in one place. With some topics and phrases that are essential for adult life that these other companies are too scared to teach you!
Welcome to Korean Lesson Time, the most comprehensive and insanely practical way of learning Korean, ever.

What We Need & What You Get
To get everything we need for our MVP to be complete we need:
At least ONE highly skilled developer to build the customer account system which deals with the purchase history of courses, course completion statistics, refinements to the game, and enabling some harder to code features in the app.
If we exceed our goal we can :

hire more developers to get the product launched quicker
get additional upgrades to graphics, music, and sound effects
work on more varied game modes for practicing and testing knowledge
add extra features we might discover during the building process

Some rewards for you lovely backers include:

Special Character sets ONLY for campaign supporters
Discounts on all courses available at launch*
Your name credited in our Hall of Fame
Every course free forever**
Your character in the game**

*see tiers for more details
**limited to very exclusive backers

Why We Can't Do It Alone
We've been working on this project since mid January. What started as a small conversation about how we could give better teaching resources with our in-video Korean Lesson Times has blossomed into a fully fledged learning experience. Xander even started to learn how to code for the app development side but some features are too complicated for him at this stage. It's taken so much of our time that we've been neglecting our YouTube channel by uploading less frequently.

By hiring an experienced developer (or multiple) we can assure the app is stable and secure
Being able to pay our Korean voice actors more for their time and input (it's at least 42 hours of recording for the planned courses! - Yikes!)
A bigger team can share more of the work and we can finish the products quicker!

Your contributions, big or small, will aid in the construction of this project. The more we can raise the more people we can hire to get this done quicker.
If we can't get the full goal amount it's ok, we'll keep working on the project and we'll release as soon as the system and app work smoothly with no problems.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't donate, we totally understand. We hope, at least, you could ask others to help us out with this by:

Liking the Campaign Launch video on YouTube
Sharing this page on Facebook and Twitter.
​Go to a Korean study gorup? Tell them about it 
If your friends and family like us, ask them!

Help us spread the word so we can get all the materials finished quicker and to a hopefully even better quality standard :)
Basic Bundle (Retail $50)
The Basic Bundle consists of Korean Lesson Time: Korean Alphabet, Korean Lesson Time: Korean Numbers, and Korean Lesson Time: Korean Grammar and is 16% cheaper than buying them separately.

Korean Lesson Time: Korean Alphabet (Retail $15)You can't start learning if you don't know your alphabet! The Korean alphabet consists of 40 characters, some of which are pronounced with sounds that don't exist in English. But don't worry, Korean Lesson Time will have plenty of examples of how they're supposed to sound and how to produce the sounds even if you've only grown up with English.This Korean Lesson Time will include an extensive PDF, audiobook form, videos describing each letter, its pronunciation and how to produce it, and its corresponding game modes in the App.
Korean Lesson Time: Korean Numbers (Retail $15)So much of life depends on being able to count: buying stuff, telling time, being with people, and expressing the order of things. Korean has two number systems, which will both be thoroughly explained in this Korean Lesson Time. This Korean Lesson Time will include an extensive PDF, audiobook form, videos describing each number, its pronunciation and how to produce it, and its corresponding game modes in the App.
Korean Lesson Time: Korean Grammar (Retail $30)Instead of teaching bits and pieces of grammar over and over again in every future Topic-Based Korean Lesson Time, which would seem like a huge redundancy in what you're paying for and would take much longer to produce, We Fancy has decided to make what is basically a Korean Grammar Index.In this KLT, we've provided the most commonly used grammar in day-to-day life. We've explained how they should be used colloquially (natural native spoken style) so you don't sound like a walking textbook. This KLT was designed to be a reference source for your journey to Korean fluency and is meant to be read and repeated over and over again as you come across unfamiliar grammar in your life or in the Topic-Based Korean Lesson Times. With the grammar in this KLT, you should be able to navigate perfectly through your day-to-day needs. Once mastered, your Korean proficiency level will be high enough to self-learn everything else through immersion (going to Korea, hanging out with Koreans in your city, watching Korean movies and dramas with or without subtitles, etc.) or advanced studies.

Topic-Based Korean Lesson Times
The current vision for the complete Korean Lesson Time series is to have 18 more topic-based Korean Lesson Times released. These will not only be language lessons but also include etiquette, social norms, and guides where relevant. As of now, the planned topics will be:


Restaurants & FoodEverything about food from what to do in a restaurant, to dishes, to ingredients, to table manners and paying bills.

Transportation Getting from the airport to anywhere else in Korea. AREX, KTX, train, subway, bus, taxi, beyond taxis, rentals, how to ask for, understand, and give directions, etc.

Self-IntroductionName, age, physical stats, where you're from, your childhood, personality, family, education, career, dreams, hobbies, likes and dislikes, etc.

Making FriendsHow to make friends, social protocols, suggesting hangouts, social culture, informal speech patterns and slang, special texting language, etc.

DatingWhere to meet people, how to initiate conversation, manners, behaviors, dating culture, expectations, cultural differences, etc.

Drinking GamesThis you'll only be able to learn by actually going to post-secondary school in Korea. A comprehensive index of Korean drinking games, the chants that go with them, and overall drinking culture.

Sex & More Every filthy thing you want to say from Netflix and Chill to euphemisms for genitals to fetishes, all in Korean. Also, anything related to sexual health: STDs, contraceptives, body parts, bodily fluids and functions, etc. 

Bad Words Insults, swear words, racist and sexist words... for education of course. You'd want to know when someone was using them at you, right?

Hotels & MoreAccommodation-types, costs, reservations, domestic traveling/holidaying/road-trips, etc.

Getting Your Own PlaceHow to find your own place, what the different types of properties are, how to measure rooms, how to ask about amenities and what's included in the room, how to call movers and what services they provide, how to negotiate prices, how to break or cancel contracts, garbage disposal, recycling, etc.

Health & HospitalsSicknesses, diseases, health and hospital culture, medicines, corrective surgery, glasses, dentistry, etc.

Plastic Surgery If you're looking to fix something surgically, everything you need to know from pricing, payment, types of surgery, and what can be changed.

BeautyCosmetics, skincare, hair styling and everything related to hair salons, fashion, nails, etc.

ShoppingSpending money, negotiating prices, where to buy what, store types, payment methods, reward systems, delivery, etc.

Fitness Working out, body parts, sports, athletics, gym memberships, negotiation memberships, diets, etc.

EmergenciesAnything related to if you're suddenly in trouble, car-related, traffic related, police, fire, medical, work, etc.

Daily LifeAll the miscellaneous things that make up one's daily life like banking, phone plans, taxes, insurance, getting a vehicle and the right licenses, visas, dealing with difficult people, etc.

CelebrationsNational holidays, general holidays, break times, special celebration events, moments, and occasions, expected manners and behaviors, gift giving, gift receiving, etc.

After getting some feedback from our surveys, we may also develop proficiency-levels within those topics to create a more easily consumable structure.
Pricing will vary between the courses depending on how much information and how useful we believe they will be for you guys.
Every single one of these Topic-Based Korean Lesson Times will include PDFs, audiobook form, videos, and their corresponding App features.
Of course, these may be subject to change, but change will be positive and include more value for you guys, never less.
Ultimate Future Vision: XYZ Lesson Time & Localization
Ultimately, we intend for ""Lesson Time"" to be a huge education brand. Under one super powerful app, we'll be branching out to every major language. From there, we'd go into pre-secondary subjects like Mathematics, Sciences, History, etc. Beyond that, we see advanced, post-secondary topics such as Calculus, Advanced Sciences, Engineering, Philosophy, Literature, etc. 
All of this is using English as a starting point, but what if English isn't your native language? Well, ultimately, we'd localize all our material so that a user can pick their native tongue and learn everything, including English, using their native language!
One day, with your help and support, we hope to be the leading global education resource with a brand that is synonymous with practical, fun, and actually effective.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Today, we are excited to introduce the SolidMaker, an affordable, user-friendly, laser SLA 3D printer that brings your creativity to life. SolidMaker is cost-effective, powerful, versatile, and prints better than you can imagine. It is a leading next-generation laser SLA 3D printer that delivers professional-quality prints to your desktop. <br/> </p>

<p>If you are looking for professional printers that can deliver stunning details, stereolithography (SLA) machines are the right choice. Laser SLA 3D printing produces high-resolution results with smooth finishes that you cannot get from FDM, DLP or even LCD printers. It uses a precision UV laser to cure photosensitive resins into 3D objects with a incredible detail. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566281311/ipathzqecxlqajp4yyj2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<div data-id=""25783934""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""> </figure></div>
<p>However, laser stereolithography 3D printers have traditionally been very expensive, often costing thousands of dollars. In an effort to reduce costs and elevate performance, we took our years of industry experience and applied dedicated R&amp;D to create a printer with advanced materials, structure, and modules. </p>
<p>Now, SolidMaker can meet consumers' demands for high performance, reliability, and low-cost. By offering a highly precise laser SLA 3D printer at a breakthrough price, high-performance 3D printing is now available in the perfect cost range for artisans, designers and small businesses.<br/> </p>

</div></div>","Today, we are excited to introduce the SolidMaker, an affordable, user-friendly, laser SLA 3D printer that brings your creativity to life. SolidMaker is cost-effective, powerful, versatile, and prints better than you can imagine. It is a leading next-generation laser SLA 3D printer that delivers professional-quality prints to your desktop.  

 
If you are looking for professional printers that can deliver stunning details, stereolithography (SLA) machines are the right choice. Laser SLA 3D printing produces high-resolution results with smooth finishes that you cannot get from FDM, DLP or even LCD printers. It uses a precision UV laser to cure photosensitive resins into 3D objects with a incredible detail. 
 
However, laser stereolithography 3D printers have traditionally been very expensive, often costing thousands of dollars. In an effort to reduce costs and elevate performance, we took our years of industry experience and applied dedicated R&D to create a printer with advanced materials, structure, and modules. 
Now, SolidMaker can meet consumers' demands for high performance, reliability, and low-cost. By offering a highly precise laser SLA 3D printer at a breakthrough price, high-performance 3D printing is now available in the perfect cost range for artisans, designers and small businesses. 

 
 
 
 Top-notch Printing Quality | 3 Microns Laser Movement Accuracy  
  
 
 
 
 
Unlike DLP and LCD 3D Printer, laser 3D printers' accuracy depends on the minimum movement distance of laser spot. With minimum 0.003/0.01mm XYZ laser movement accuracy, SolidMaker can eke out astonishing high-resolution 3D prints. It’s perfect for both beginners and professions being used to make razor handles, movie props and even false teeth, etc.  

Bigger Printing Area | Up to 4.7 x 4.7 x 6’’(120x120x150mm)  
  
Supporting the printing area of up to 4.7 x 4.7 x 6’’(120x120x150mm), SolidMaker is ideal for making 3D objects of medical models, architecture renditions, and other large-scale formats in a single print. With larger print sizes, SolidMaker has virtually infinite applications.   Excellent Laser Speed | 320mm/s, Twice the Efficiency  
 For Printing A Bird Cage 
 
 
3D printing technology has been in the industry for decades, however, speed has been a limiting factor – until today. SolidMaker can print faster than typical SLA 3d printers without sacrificing surface finish quality and detail accuracy. Your stunning high-resolution creations take shape in minutes.   

Laser Stereolithography | 100 µm Spot Size for Finest Details 
 
Unlike some of the SLA printers on the market, SolidMaker is driven by a UV laser. With its 100 µm spot, SolidMaker can print with precision and speed. It scans the laser into the vat and solidifies resin into objects, and after a layer is finished, it raises the build platform slightly and cures the next layer. 
 

Compatible with 3rd Party Resins | Print without Limitation 
 
Many 3D printers available today only officially support their own company-produced resins. This is inconvenient and can put expensive limitations on consumers. SolidMaker is different. It works with most available resins, such as standard resins, dental resins, flexible resins, engineering resins, and more.  Five Resins Available | White/Blue/Grey/Red/Yellow  
 
SolidMaker 405nm resin is specially designed for reducing volume shrinkage and printing time during the building process, as well as ensuring a highly-precise print model. SolidMaker comes with five colors of standard resins, allowing you to print 3D objects in virtually any color you want. 
 

3.5″ Intuitive Touchscreen | User-Friendly Design 

 
SolidMaker Pro has simple, intuitive controls by way of a 3.5″ touchscreen interface that supports multiple languages, selecting print files, layer thicknesses, and other essential parameters. This user-friendly control process makes 3D printing simple, fast and convenient for both beginners and professionals alike.   
Real-time Calibration | 99.5% Print Success Rate 
 
Real-time calibration ensures a near-perfect success rate for prints. Instead of constant adjustments that are typical with other printers, we installed the calibration system inside the machine, where it monitors itself continuously to maintain perfect laser placement and model accuracy.   Plug-and-Play | One-press to Print  
  
A good 3D printer should be designed for everyone. That’s why SolidMaker is intuitive and easy to use. With a one-press print process and easy to understand controls, children and adults alike can easily start their 3D printing journey with SolidMaker! （The USB slot will be placed in the front when mass production started.）   

All-Metal Body 
  
The all-metal body of SolidMaker is tough and durable but also elegant as a piece of art in your workshop, lab or home. It has been rigorously tested for years of reliable service and precision accuracy.  
Power-off Memory Function 
  
If the power is turned off unexpectedly during printing, it can follow the previous progress when the power is turned on. No more time and consumables will be wasted due to unexpected power outages. 
Slicer Software-SolidPreform 
 Adjust the Model Size/Printing Speed/Layer Heigh etc. 
 Compatible with Mac, Windows and Linux System 
SolidMaker has a fully developed and easy to use a software called SolidPreform. It has an intuitive user interface that makes 3D printing easy for anyone and uses a thorough system of tests to avoid printing errors before they occur.",45.0,3,"1 Campaign

<span>My Story</span><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""> </span>
</h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>I started using GWT 7 years ago, shortly after I finished my Computer Science master’s degree at UMass Amherst.  In grad school I was particularly interested in compilers, Java runtimes, and bytecode instrumentation, which is probably why I decided to tackle this crazy-difficult GWT compiler project that you’re reading about now.  But back in 2006, with my grad school obligations just finished, I wanted to finally do something a little less serious.  That’s when I embarked on a quest to make the world's first multiplayer typing game.  At the same time I discovered GWT, which allowed me to use my Java skills to build a rich-client MMO game that anyone could play through a web browser.  That’s how TypeRacer, my bootstrapped startup venture, was born.  Launched in 2008, typeracer.com quickly grew to over a hundred thousand monthly users.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>After receiving email from users describing various cryptic bugs, I set up a system to log all JavaScript exceptions in production to Google Analytics.  I let the data accumulate for a couple days and when I looked at all the exceptions that showed up on my Google Analytics screen, I was really surprised.  There were dozens of different types of client-side exceptions being reported that I had never seen during development and I had no idea how to reproduce any of them, because I didn’t know where in my source code these exceptions originated.  For the next release I worked on adding stack traces to those exception reports, and I quickly realized that JavaScript stack traces weren’t available in all browsers, and even if they were available, they were useless, since my code was deployed obfuscated.  Deploying “pretty” code was out of the question, because it would increase the download time, decrease performance, and reveal the “secret sauce” of the app.  All of these things are important when competitors are trying to clone your app and enter your market.  Also, the most popular browser of the day (the same one one that had the most bugs) did not provide stack traces either way.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>After all these cryptic exceptions had become enough of a nuisance, I started a little research project to see if I could develop a precompiler which could modify Java code to maintain an artificial call stack.  This, along with a few auxiliary classes, enabled me to get Java stack traces with method-level granularity in all browsers, and I passed out a </span><a href=""https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_MlWdpkpAA6M2RBMERSeElpYXc/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>white paper</span></a><span> describing this project at Google I/O 2009.  The precompiler I wrote in 2009 is the predecessor of this project and I’ve been using it in my production builds up until now.  Unfortunately that solution wasn’t perfect, since it only showed the methods on the stack and not complete activation records with line numbers, nor did it cover native methods.  It did help track down some of the bugs that were causing the exceptions, but many still remained elusive.  Despite the shortcomings, I decided my precompiler was good enough for the time being (in the cost vs. benefit sense) and stopped working on it.  However, three months ago, while upgrading my app from GWT 1.5 to 2.5, I got the itch to finally solve this ridiculously hard problem once and for all.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The reason for my renewed interest in this problem was my discovery of some new experimental features in GWT, which are described on the </span><a href=""https://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/wiki/WebModeExceptions"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>WebModeExceptions wiki page</span></a><span> and this </span><a href=""http://www.summa-tech.com/blog/2012/06/11/7-tips-for-exception-handling-in-gwt/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>excellent article</span></a><span>.  I was really excited to try these experimental settings, but my excitement turned into disappointment when I discovered that none of them actually work correctly.  But, I could see that the foundation for a working solution had been laid, and I thought I’d be able to re-implement the code more correctly and more efficiently.  With a little time and effort, I was sure I could finally solve the problem of JavaScript stack traces in production that I’ve been having since 2008.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That’s why three months ago I dived into the GWT compiler source code and did not come up for air until about 10 weeks later, after I had fixed every bug in the existing solution, made the stack traces more Java-like, reduced the compiled code size overhead by nearly 50%, and made the configuration user-friendly and able to take advantage of the source map support in Chrome.  You can read about the technical details in my </span><a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1owhmb05DIaiThm46AMFktBZzWtaz0281PFuyJIGuiWg/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>writeup</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In the 10 weeks I spent hacking the GWT compiler to carry out this project, I’ve learned almost as much about JavaScript and GWT as I had in the last 7 years as a user of both, and it was one of the most interesting projects I’ve ever done.  But it was also frustrating, because in the beginning, I could only see the tip of the iceberg in terms of how broken things were with the original implementation, so I couldn’t have predicted that it would take nearly my entire spring season to finish.  For a while it seemed that every problem I solved exposed new problems that were previously hidden, and there were dozens of these.   If you’re curious, you can read more about those challenges, as well as the complete implementation details, in my research </span><a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1owhmb05DIaiThm46AMFktBZzWtaz0281PFuyJIGuiWg/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>writeup</span></a><span>.  Some of the problems were really interesting to work on and led to some really cool discoveries and solutions, while other problems, like browser-specific bugs in JavaScript interpreters, were mostly just frustrating.  Nevertheless, I was hooked, and I kept going until I got everything to work perfectly.</span></p>

I wrote this research paper describing how my solution works in detail.
I’m asking the GWT community to pitch in and hire me to finish this undertaking and contribute my patch back to GWT, because I’m convinced that every GWT developer would benefit from my work.

What I Need and What You Get 

As an indie developer on a tight budget, I have to focus on money-making efforts, and I’d like to be sure that the GWT community really wants this project before I spend much more time on it.  That’s why I’m trying to raise a modest sum to sponsor my to continued efforts.  Your donation will provide the motivation I need to work on contributing my code back to the GWT project and maintaining it thereafter.  I think it might take somewhere between 40 and 100 more hours of my time to polish it, go through the code reviews, handle any issues I might not have considered, write docs and unit tests, and continue maintenance of the code after it’s been accepted into GWT.  If funded, I will do my best to see that my code makes it into the next release of GWT 2.x and GWT 3.0.
But you don’t actually have to wait until my code makes it into GWT, because everyone who contributes $25 or more, will immediately receive a JAR file that you can start using right away with GWT 2.5.0, and get perfect stack traces in your production builds!
All you have to do is make your contribution, download the JAR file that I’ll email, add it to your GWT compiler classpath, and insert this line into your .gwt.xml config:
<inherits name=""com.google.gwt.core.PreserveStackTraces""/>
Your production builds will then have perfect Java-like stack traces whenever one of your users encounters an exception with any version of IE, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Chrome or any other browser supported by GWT.  Best of all, your code permutations deployed to Chrome users will not get any bigger, and your other code permutations will be only about 45% larger, without any significant runtime overhead (I’ve performed extensive benchmarking and testing in most browsers).  By contributing just $25, you can start using the patch right away and provide feedback on the functionality before it’s finalized.
If you are able to give more, then you may want contribute at higher levels, which include personalized email, phone, and even on-site support from me, so you can benefit from my GWT experience.  You can also your support perk to ask for advice on other matters or even ask me to build other GWT compiler tweaks specific to your needs.
But you don’t have to give a lot to shape the future of this project.  Even the smallest contribution is a vote for me to keep going.
The Impact
If you develop applications using GWT, you will see the impact of this project as soon as you deploy your app and get perfect stack traces with exact Java source line numbers from any JavaScript exception thrown in any user’s browser.  It will save you hours, days, and weeks spent blindly searching for bugs, both in your code as well as in GWT code.
I believe the impact of this crowdfunding campaign could also be much broader than that.  If this project reaches its funding goal, it might encourage more developers to work on other major improvements to GWT.  Now that GWT is spinning off into an independent OSS project and Google appears to have significantly reduced its resources allocated to GWT, perhaps crowdfunding campaigns could become a way to sustain GWT as the best alternative to JavaScript for developing web and mobile applications for years to come.

<h3>What It Is</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Counterfringe is an online brand protection service that
helps businesses and consumers exchange information about counterfeit
products.  Our <b>mobile apps</b> will allow business participants to instantly warn a
dedicated online community of consumers about counterfeit products, including
those that may be dangerous to the public. 
Consumers who report counterfeit products can earn rewards from their
favorite brands and influence future product development.  To learn more, please visit

<p><a href=""http://www.counterfringe.com."" rel=""noopener nofollow""><br/></a></p>
<h3>

Who and Why We Are</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Counterfringe was founded in 2012 by Andrew Tichovolsky, a
Massachusetts attorney specializing in Intellectual Property.  Mr. Tichovolsky received his J.D. from the
University of New Hampshire School of Law in 2012 and his B.A. from Cornell
University in 2003.  Unlike other
industries, legal services have been slow to embrace the many benefits of social networking and crowd-sourcing. 
Counterfringe hopes to be a pioneer in this regard, thereby reducing
costs for businesses and consumers, protecting the public from dangerous
products, and eliminating a funding source for terrorist organizations.  We are not affiliated with any law firm and are devoting 100% of our time to this project.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>

Funding Needs</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>We need additional funding to finish developing our website
and mobile apps and to promote our launch. 
We hope to raise at least $75,000 and finish initial testing of our

What It Is


Counterfringe is an online brand protection service that
helps businesses and consumers exchange information about counterfeit
products.  Our mobile apps will allow business participants to instantly warn a
dedicated online community of consumers about counterfeit products, including
those that may be dangerous to the public. 
Consumers who report counterfeit products can earn rewards from their
favorite brands and influence future product development.  To learn more, please visit
www.counterfringe.com.



Who and Why We Are


Counterfringe was founded in 2012 by Andrew Tichovolsky, a
Massachusetts attorney specializing in Intellectual Property.  Mr. Tichovolsky received his J.D. from the
University of New Hampshire School of Law in 2012 and his B.A. from Cornell
University in 2003.  Unlike other
industries, legal services have been slow to embrace the many benefits of social networking and crowd-sourcing. 
Counterfringe hopes to be a pioneer in this regard, thereby reducing
costs for businesses and consumers, protecting the public from dangerous
products, and eliminating a funding source for terrorist organizations.  We are not affiliated with any law firm and are devoting 100% of our time to this project.



Funding Needs


We need additional funding to finish developing our website
and mobile apps and to promote our launch. 
We hope to raise at least $75,000 and finish initial testing of our
applications by January 2014.

<h3><strong>VH-80 is a bilateral laser measuring device. </strong></h3>
<p>VH-80 shoots two pulses of laser light from two sources in opposite directions and measures the amount of time it takes for each pulse to bounce back to its accompanied sensors. Since light moves at a constant, VH-80 can calculate the distance between itself and the targets with high accuracy.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Watch How It Works (featuring Rory)</h3>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/1e-_-tb6Lbo?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" style=""width: 620px;height: 329px;""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Two?</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i63.tinypic.com/2ahw9wz.gif"" src="""" style=""""/><p>From ancient foot steps to modern laser technology, the measurement tool went through many transformations. But, one factor never changed: <strong>the necessity to start from 0 to your destination.</strong> Most cases, the measurer must travel with the tool as well. It's something we may take for granted, a common sense process. But is it? </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i68.tinypic.com/2q906c9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>VH-80 means you can measure the distance between two points by<strong> positioning yourself anywhere along the line of measurement</strong>. In complicated working environments, when you need more than two hands or an extra body or two, and there are obstacles in your way, VH-80 eliminates all of these hassles.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i65.tinypic.com/21mvr42.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>  Two laser diodes mean VH-80 can<strong> take three measurements per single action</strong>: the left, right and total combined. Therefore, when measuring multiple lengths, the advantages to using VH-80 is exponentially increased, reducing your moves by factor of three.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493631454/z8orpuhexxpdeoor1is0.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>VH-80's measurement covers <strong>a total of 80 meters</strong>. That's the length of a soccer field. How fast can you run across the field and back to retrieve your tape measure? Get it done in a second with VH-80.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Time Saved is Incomparable</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494383034/b8qdkm61usl6c019w91v.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can save significant time by effectively reducing your need to travel to various references points required by one directional devices.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>An Extra Hand in Your Pocket</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493631604/viuaf5vphm9s30hgvwmh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Being free in position also means highly improved quality in safety and mobility. Not having to crouch to the floor or set on a ladder may seem like a minor improvement for a single measurement, but often we are measuring more than one length. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Make taking measurements the easiest part of your job.</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i64.tinypic.com/311wdjp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p>VH-80 is really makes it comfortable when you have to repeatedly get down or constantly move the ladder to travel across the space. We are hoping that VH-80 can help and revive passion in folks who have been shy from working on new projects because of physical discomfort or inconvenience as well.So that's some very little changes VH-80 can bring to your life. </p>
<p><strong>Simple little things like time, safety, and resources - the trifecta of a project investment. No big deal !  </strong></p>
<h3> </h3>

<p>As a laser distance measuring device, VH-80 is capable of handling a variety of operations and works simultaneously with a smart device application for extended functions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i68.tinypic.com/fdh6jn.gif"" src="""" style=""width: 614px;height: 122px;""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i66.tinypic.com/qnuwrd.gif"" src="""" style=""width: 614px;height: 124px;""/></p>
<p>For a starter, VH-80 is a bilateral laser distance measurer, but yes, it can also function in a single direction as well. While the bilateral setting is default, you can easily switch to a single laser measurement setting, measured from the base or front. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>VH-80 has a total of 5 internal auto calculation modes for your convenience:</p>
<h3><strong>Continuous Measurement</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i68.tinypic.com/1zlt2qv.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 620px;height: 339px;""/></p>
<p>In Continuous Measurement mode, VH-80 measures at a set time interval providing live change along with your movement. Since VH-80 takes the left, right and total value simultaneously, this mode is incredibly helpful in finding midpoints or sectioning.</p>
<h3>Area</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i63.tinypic.com/104gcd5.gif"" src="""" style=""width: 621px;height: 356px;""/> </p>
<p>By acquiring two values in a row, VH-80 can quickly calculate the Area of your space. The movement efficiency of VH-80 is most highlighted by equations like area and volume because you can acquire the necessary values by just turning your wrist once, instead of traveling and crisscrossing the space.</p>
<h3>Volume</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i67.tinypic.com/23hrsld.gif"" src="""" style=""width: 619px;height: 351px;""/> </p>
<p>VH-80 can acquire the Volume of a space with three consecutive measurements. Like the area mode, VH-80 is powerful for these occasions. With three flicks of the wrist, it's incredibly easy to finish this task as well.</p>
<h3>Pythagoras</h3>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i65.tinypic.com/24y7bf8.gif"" src="""" style=""width: 617px;height: 358px;""/></p>
<p>Pythagorean Theorem Mode makes an indirect measurement by measuring two sides of a triangle to acquire the third. This is most helpful when you need to measure lengths that are large and in view. </p>
<p>  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493634512/f39m4qhw2ffoywl8wcai.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>When we make measurements, we usually need to do it more than once. VH-80 has an internal memory that keeps a record of up to 9 measurements. But guess what? Welcome to 2017. We have an app for that. Your smart device receives data live from VH-80 through Bluetooth 4.0, and with the internal memory of a smart device, the number of measurements you can save is practically infinite.</p>

<p>The accuracy of the laser measurement is ± 3mm with class II laser diodes. Each diode can measure up the 40m - making it a total of 80m possible. The device weighs only 150 grams. You can hang it lightly from a strap around your wrist or neck and keep your hands free all day while keeping it close by at your need. The clear white backlit simple interface allows you to work in darker environments without hesitation. </p>
<p>VH-80 is a class II laser which is harmless to the human skin, except the eyes. Always be careful with eyes and lasers!</p>
<p>VH-80 runs on 2 AAA batteries. While rechargeable lithium ion were considered at development, two factors had us decide for the former: first, applying cell batteries allows VH-80 from physically sizing up. and second, considering the environment for measurements particularly in the fields, finding an electric outlet and waiting to recharge the device seemed less appealing than quickly swapping to fresh cell batteries.</p>
<p>VH-80 uses Bluetooth 4.0, also known as the Bluetooth Low Energy, which ensures an immediate and stable bluetooth connection with extremely low energy use. That's why it was possible to have the Bluetooth connection run consistently on VH-80. So you only have to connect from your smart device, instead of fumbling with both devices trying to run the signal at the same time for synchronization. </p>

</div></div>","VH-80 is a bilateral laser measuring device. 
VH-80 shoots two pulses of laser light from two sources in opposite directions and measures the amount of time it takes for each pulse to bounce back to its accompanied sensors. Since light moves at a constant, VH-80 can calculate the distance between itself and the targets with high accuracy.
 
Watch How It Works (featuring Rory)

 
Why Two?
From ancient foot steps to modern laser technology, the measurement tool went through many transformations. But, one factor never changed: the necessity to start from 0 to your destination. Most cases, the measurer must travel with the tool as well. It's something we may take for granted, a common sense process. But is it? 

 
VH-80 means you can measure the distance between two points by positioning yourself anywhere along the line of measurement. In complicated working environments, when you need more than two hands or an extra body or two, and there are obstacles in your way, VH-80 eliminates all of these hassles. 

  Two laser diodes mean VH-80 can take three measurements per single action: the left, right and total combined. Therefore, when measuring multiple lengths, the advantages to using VH-80 is exponentially increased, reducing your moves by factor of three.

 
VH-80's measurement covers a total of 80 meters. That's the length of a soccer field. How fast can you run across the field and back to retrieve your tape measure? Get it done in a second with VH-80.
 
The Time Saved is Incomparable

 
You can save significant time by effectively reducing your need to travel to various references points required by one directional devices.
 
An Extra Hand in Your Pocket

Being free in position also means highly improved quality in safety and mobility. Not having to crouch to the floor or set on a ladder may seem like a minor improvement for a single measurement, but often we are measuring more than one length. 
 
Make taking measurements the easiest part of your job.
 
VH-80 is really makes it comfortable when you have to repeatedly get down or constantly move the ladder to travel across the space. We are hoping that VH-80 can help and revive passion in folks who have been shy from working on new projects because of physical discomfort or inconvenience as well.So that's some very little changes VH-80 can bring to your life. 
Simple little things like time, safety, and resources - the trifecta of a project investment. No big deal !  
 

 

As a laser distance measuring device, VH-80 is capable of handling a variety of operations and works simultaneously with a smart device application for extended functions.
 
 
For a starter, VH-80 is a bilateral laser distance measurer, but yes, it can also function in a single direction as well. While the bilateral setting is default, you can easily switch to a single laser measurement setting, measured from the base or front. 
 
VH-80 has a total of 5 internal auto calculation modes for your convenience:
Continuous Measurement

In Continuous Measurement mode, VH-80 measures at a set time interval providing live change along with your movement. Since VH-80 takes the left, right and total value simultaneously, this mode is incredibly helpful in finding midpoints or sectioning.
Area
 
By acquiring two values in a row, VH-80 can quickly calculate the Area of your space. The movement efficiency of VH-80 is most highlighted by equations like area and volume because you can acquire the necessary values by just turning your wrist once, instead of traveling and crisscrossing the space.
Volume
 
VH-80 can acquire the Volume of a space with three consecutive measurements. Like the area mode, VH-80 is powerful for these occasions. With three flicks of the wrist, it's incredibly easy to finish this task as well.
Pythagoras
 
Pythagorean Theorem Mode makes an indirect measurement by measuring two sides of a triangle to acquire the third. This is most helpful when you need to measure lengths that are large and in view. 
  


When we make measurements, we usually need to do it more than once. VH-80 has an internal memory that keeps a record of up to 9 measurements. But guess what? Welcome to 2017. We have an app for that. Your smart device receives data live from VH-80 through Bluetooth 4.0, and with the internal memory of a smart device, the number of measurements you can save is practically infinite.
 

 
But here’s the really cool thing about the app. You can quickly construct plans of your measuring activity directly on a photo reference. 
The goal with the app is to streamline and effectively organize your measurement activities on the spot. Too many measurements can be hectic even if it's automatically ordered. And jotting down a sketch of a plan requires multitasking that largely hinders your work efficiency. That is why VH-80 with its smart application is an ideal upgrade to your process. Just measure, drag and drop. That's all it takes!

<p>Our first product line focuses on sharing from mobile devices. From my own experience, it is frustrating to share content on my mobile device. It’s like playing hot potato: You are constantly passing your device from one person to the next.</p>
<p>When I’m with my friends, I like sharing my photos, videos, and social media content. But, every time I have to hand off my phone, the process becomes anti-social. For example, try to have a group of your friends share a photo from a mobile phone and see what happens. It becomes a series of monotonous one-on-one interactions. You have to retell a story or describe a photo over-and-over. Often, you find out that your friends are not getting the experience that you intended.</p>
<p>I wanted something better. So, the team came up with a simple, practical, easy-to-use, and fun way to share your world on the go.</p>
<p>Our first product design is called Go. Go Social and Go Big are projectors for your iPhone or iPod touch.</p>
<p>The Go devices are fully self-contained, require no cables or power cords, and turn your iOS devices into mobile projectors.</p>
<p>We are a unique kind of startup. We have fully functional hardware and software that is production ready. Also, we have a chosen a manufacturer that is ready for mass production. For us, production means staging inventory and committing to volume orders. That takes upfront money and that is how we need your help.</p>
<p>Anyone committing $100 to this campaign will get our high end product: Go Big. Go Big is a portable projector, a battery charger for your iOS device, and so much more.</p>
<p>Our products will change the way people interact. Gatherings with family and friends will be fun and interactive again. Our sleek device makes Facebook social again!  </p>
<p>If this is something that you are interested in, link our promo video to your Facebook page or Twitter account. Help us get the word out:</p>

<p>We've asked students and researchers  and the  second main reason why they think that VR is not used it's because any type of environment that they need to create for their experiments has to be created from scratch.</p>
<p>Labs and students alike suffer from 3 constraints:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p><p></p><ul><li>Limited access to people with the know-how to create the virtual environments</li></ul><ul><li>Limited timeframes to design and complete experiments</li></ul><ul><li>Limited flexibility to do research</li></ul><h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></h3>
<h4>Limited access to people with the know-how to create the VR environments</h4>
<p>If you are researching phobias and anxiety disorders, most likely you are not versed in coding, 3D asset creation, sound, user interface,control method implementation and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Instead of asking a 3D artist to invest time into creating virtual environments for you, we intend to provide you with a solution so you can skip right to what matters.</p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></h3>
<h4>Limited Timeframes</h4>
<p>Even if you had an affordable VR headset in your hands, you would still be empty handed. Developing VR software is time consuming and derails you from your main goal, doing research.</p>
<p>If you were to target a heterogeneous population -say people with small animal phobias- to investigate a single variable -increase in physiological response to the phobic stimulus- you would have to create the different creatures for each specific phobia, animate them and script their behaviors.</p>
<p>Once PHOBOS is finished, it will give you a framework so you can focus on the experiment instead of spending time creating the conditions for it or asking the Computer Science Departments or IT for borrowed resources to help with your experiment.</p>
<p>Our goal is that by using PHOBOS you will decrease the overall length of the experiment design phase and allow you to allot a higher percentage of time to actual research.</p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></h3>
<h4>Limited flexibility</h4>
<p>Affordable VR hardware and PHOBOS put VR within the reach of college and graduate students to do some of their research without having to schedule ""VR Lab time"" or find the  people to assist them with the creation of environments. Small groups will be able to use almost any space to do research without being left with no other option than to work in one centralized space.</p>
<p>The design phase can become de-centralized so the environments' conditions and variables can be defined, tested and rehearsed before moving onto the Lab to work with the subjects where supervision should be needed.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><a href=""https://plugins.jetbrains.com/idea/plugin/7622-php-inspections-ea-extended-"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Php Inspections (EA Extended)</a> is a static code analyzer for PhpStorm and IdeaUltimate IDEs which boosts up developers productivity without interrupting workflow with on-the-fly analysis and automatic fixes. Your support is very important for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The analyzer is <a href=""https://github.com/kalessil/phpinspectionsea"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">free of charge and open source</a>, already well accepted by PHP community and now takes more time to maintain and deliver new features.</li>

<li>You can enable us to move the project further and make it even more useful.</li>
<li>We would like to dedicate more time to the project this year, and it would be awesome if this happens!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>From the very beginning, the project had no funding and we reached now the point when the project support requires us to scale, e.g. we have to postpone 'Call to a member function ... on a non-object' inspection in favor of documentation; the same applies to quick-fixes. Possible ways as hiring someone or taking some work time for the project are need funding.</p>
<p>Also below we would like to make transparent how the funding will be distributed:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are targeting 10 000 Euros in order to reach our goals (3 goals, 33.3% of the funding for each goal).</li>
<li>The raised funding will be spent on development of automatic fixes, <a href=""https://github.com/kalessil/phpinspectionsea/tree/master/docs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">documentation</a> and translation: exactly in this order.<ul>
<li>For each goal, we will create tickets in <a href=""https://github.com/kalessil/phpinspectionsea/issues"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our backlog</a> where it will be possible to track our progress.</li>
<li>For each release of the analyzer, we will post a campaign update with a precise report about quick-fixes, documentation and translation features funded by the campaign.</li>
<li>If we have to hire people, we'll publish bills as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, a unique perk is available to German backers - on-site workshop where I'll share best practices using the analyzer. Other locations are possible as well but this needs to be discussed separately.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The campaign goals are reflecting community feedback and demands we are aware of, hence we definitely expecting some positive changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding more automatic fixes will boost up at least your personal productivity.</li>
<li>Adding more documentation will increase the level and security awareness of your colleagues and teams.</li>
<li>Translating to other languages will enable more people to take advantages of using the analyzer.</li>

<p>Social media management---<i>especially in nonprofits</i>---is often relegated to an unfortunate ranking on our to do lists: 'when there's time.'

<p><u>OCT. 30 UPDATE</u>: We're getting so close to making this planning notebook a reality that I've decided to sweeten the pot to tempt the digital-first and paperless crowd. <strong>All backers that contribute at the Social Media Planning BUNDLE ($75) and above will *also* receive access to a companion online digital *course*</strong>. This is a super sweet offering since backers will get early access to a course that will sell for at least $75 when it launches.</p>

<h3>This simple planner was created to help <i>you </i>hone your social media superpowers!</h3>
<p>This planning notebook outlines a step-by-step process for crafting a social media strategy that can be implemented in just a few hours a month. This framework is inspired and informed by a decade of lessons learned from using social media to attract volunteers, build community-powered projects, and engage diverse coalitions from across public and private sectors.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Feeling overwhelmed by social media?<br/>Struggling to achieve results?<br/>Finding it difficult to maintain momentum?</h3>
<p>If you're willing to commit a few hours to working through the prompts in this planning notebook, you'll find that it will help you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>identify your goals - <i>and ensure you're advancing your mission in a measurable way</i>
</li>
<li>map out opportunities - <i>so they don't sneak up on you!</i>
</li>

<h3>Feedback from past social media workshops, trainings, and products</h3>

<li>As we know, one of a major purpose of Raspberry Pi is education. Student could use  Raspberry Pi to learn programming. If they want to know how to access and control peripheral device, it is easy too - just use GPIO.</li>
<li>In entry level school, most school course focus on software, not hardware. With HAT module, they can easy to arrange their course on programming rather than spend too much time in managing hardware.</li>
<li>Teacher could prepare necessary HAT modules for each course chapter. When the course move forward, student could change the HAT module then everything is ready for next course. It can save time and reduce the risk to broke the teaching aid.</li>
</ul><h3>Prototype</h3><ul style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li>We know thousands of people use Raspberry Pi to develop product prototype. But without suitable case, those prototype is still difficult to leave from laboratory. </li>
<li>We can purchase experiment PCB HAT from the market, build our prototype on the experiment PCB HAT  then integrate all components in the hubor modular case.  With the feature like thin, wall mount and magnet, people could install their prototype easy and safe - since there is no unnecessary wire/cable expose outside.</li>
<li>When we need to install the prototype in somewhere without stable power, low power consumption and backup power become very important. With ZeroEXP mobile edition (backup power), we can deploy prototype with Raspberry Pi Zero (low power consumption) to enhance prototype stability.</li>
</ul><h3>Business</h3><ul style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li><p>As the Raspberry Pi get popular, more and more product use Raspberry Pi board as their product core. </p></li>
<li><p>Since Raspberry Pi is a general purpose board, maybe it is not a best choice when we want to mass produce the product; to choose specific board for dedicated function is better.</p></li>
<li><p>But there is still advantage when we need fast development and the volume is limited. It is suitable for small business, project based development etc. With hubor module expansion case, it is easy to package all components and sell as a product.</p></li>

Operate Raspberry Pi easy.
Integrate sensor, components and wire together.
Replace HAT easy.
Package Raspberry Pi with added HAT easy.
Have a good looking to let us install the system in various environment.
Provide good mobility.
 Solution OverviewOur innovation: Features
Feature - ""Horizontal Expansion"" 
Feature - ""Push-in Connection"" 
Feature - ""Professional Looking"" 
Feature - ""Easy Access"" 
Feature - ""Wall Mount"" 
Feature - ""Palm Size"" Full Demo Scenarios ExamplesEducation
As we know, one of a major purpose of Raspberry Pi is education. Student could use  Raspberry Pi to learn programming. If they want to know how to access and control peripheral device, it is easy too - just use GPIO.
In entry level school, most school course focus on software, not hardware. With HAT module, they can easy to arrange their course on programming rather than spend too much time in managing hardware.
Teacher could prepare necessary HAT modules for each course chapter. When the course move forward, student could change the HAT module then everything is ready for next course. It can save time and reduce the risk to broke the teaching aid.
Prototype
We know thousands of people use Raspberry Pi to develop product prototype. But without suitable case, those prototype is still difficult to leave from laboratory. 
We can purchase experiment PCB HAT from the market, build our prototype on the experiment PCB HAT  then integrate all components in the hubor modular case.  With the feature like thin, wall mount and magnet, people could install their prototype easy and safe - since there is no unnecessary wire/cable expose outside.
When we need to install the prototype in somewhere without stable power, low power consumption and backup power become very important. With ZeroEXP mobile edition (backup power), we can deploy prototype with Raspberry Pi Zero (low power consumption) to enhance prototype stability.
Business
As the Raspberry Pi get popular, more and more product use Raspberry Pi board as their product core. 
Since Raspberry Pi is a general purpose board, maybe it is not a best choice when we want to mass produce the product; to choose specific board for dedicated function is better.
But there is still advantage when we need fast development and the volume is limited. It is suitable for small business, project based development etc. With hubor module expansion case, it is easy to package all components and sell as a product.
The following picture indicate a project to use Xpress 3B+Cargo C to provide remote control and environment data collection (Temperature, humidity and electronic current). We can read collected data from the central portal.
  
Product Detail - Xpress Xpress 3Bx/4Bx Components:

Accessory - Xpress Console KitDon't need to open Xpress case when you want to access your Raspberry Pi by serial console:              
Accessory - Xpress ZeroEXP Basic 
Accessory - Xpress ZeroEXP Mobile PerksWe provide the following perks for backer.Early Bird:
Those two perks contain all featured products we design. 
Early bird perks will be closed anytime, submit it quickly!
   Standard Perk - Part I:
Those perk are similar with early bird perks but the bonus item.
Standard perks will be enabled after we close early bird perks and sustained during this crowdfunding project period.
   Standard Perk - Part II:
Those perks only contain our partial product.
For people who need integrate sensor and wouldn't swap frequently, they can use Xpress 3B/4B & Cargo C - it is our lightweight version.
Standard perks will be available and sustained during this crowdfunding project period.
   Add-on PerksIf backer want to use new Raspberry Pi board in our product rather than their existing board, we can provide relative components and install Raspberry Pi/Raspbian before shipping.    Project Schedule and ShippingWe are ready to process mass production. 
All components in the photo/video is REAL, not computer aid graphic effect.
We will launch mass production process once we achieve our funding goal. By existing time estimation, we will begin to deliver perks before the end of January 2020,

We will follow the sequence of the order to manage deliver sequence. If you hope to receive your perk early, submit it NOW!

 We will deliver perks by International express service like DHL/Fedex/UPS (except Taiwan) to guarantee perk delivery and save your time in waiting.  Our Next StepWe believe such modular case could enhance Raspberry Pi use scenarios, let more people make their innovation down-to-earth. We will focus the following directions continuously:Provide various ready-to-use HAT modules
Migrate existing HAT to be HAT module.
Promote Maker's idea to be HAT module, let people could use/enjoy their innovation very easy. 
 Help people to turn their requirement into real stuff by HAT module ODM/OEM.
Provide various featured modules and accessories
Develop common modules to satisfy many people's request; ex. UPS/power module.
Develop common accessories; ex. more smart cooling components.
Provide similar modular expansion case for Arduino
Many people ask similar product in Arduino when we announce hubor modular Raspberry Pi expansion case in our Facebook fan page.
We will follow the same design concepts to design & develop modular Arduino expansion case after we get success in this campaign and complete it.
Provide metal case for more tough operation environment. 
Actually, we think the problem we try to solve is a ""packaging"" problem - how to develop a good case design to let us use Raspberry Pi very easy.
We hope we can provide  mass produced metal case to meet the requirement of tough operation environment, and keep the same or better function with other modular expansion case.
We don't have plan or schedule about metal modular expansion case development, yet. It's a chicken-or-egg conundrum...... 
Do you like our development plan and need future product but current product?
We will follow the same crowdfunding model for each major milestone of our new product,  Meanwhile we will provide excellent perk for old friend.
If you are interested in our future product but there is no requirement about our product now; you still can support us to get success of this campaign. Submit the following ""Thumb UP!""perk to let us know you are interested in our future product and have will to support us.
This ""Thumb UP!""  perk will be closed when we achieve the funding goal.

</div></div>","Welcome to the new generation of human interface devices. 
Glamos is a motion sensor that creates a virtual touchscreen anywhere. Connect it with your device and turn your screens instantly interactive. Project an invisible touchscreen near you and control a device that’s far away from you.













Glamos uses its rotating mirror module to scan its surroundings. It measures the distance between the objects and itself, transforms the data into a touch coordinate, and sends the coordinate to a display screen (like your smartphone or laptop).
 

LiDAR sensors are widely used in self-driving cars (Check out the video below to see how it works). 


 

Traditional LiDAR sensors, however, are extremely huge and require a LOT of power. We developed the world’s smallest LiDAR device with the least power consumption.




   

 
We had an opportunity to demonstrate Glamos at a coworking space in Santa Monica, and here's what happened


 





Whereas most other sensors detect motions within a small range, Glamos automatically scales the size of the virtual touchscreen. The screen can be as small as your smartphone screen OR as big as 6 x 3 ft just like the one below.  
 





Most sensors that use a camera can only capture a limited range of motion. Glamos can scan all directions without any limitations because it uses a rotating mirror module instead of a camera.
 





 

 



Project a virtual touchscreen literally anywhere you want: on your wall, on the air, on a whiteboard - you name it! 
Check out how you can use Glamos to create a touchscreen on different surfaces:  

  





Glamos turns all your mobile games into a Wii game. Connect Glamos with your phone then project the phone screen on a bigger screen using an HDMI cable. Instead of playing Candy Crush on your tiny phone for hours, you can play it on a TV screen and turn it into an exciting social activity.   


Glamos operates at 40Hz or 40fps, meaning its mirror module rotates and captures your motion 40 times per second. This allows your screen to respond to your movement as rapidly as possible- on laptops, you'll feel like your hands are an extension of your mouse cursor. 



Motion sensors tend to drain the connected device's battery super quickly. All you wanted was a seamless connection, and the next thing you know, you're left with 10% battery.
Unlike traditional motion sensors, Glamos operates on minimal power and doesn't put a toll on your device.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hey Everybody, I'm Knox, a fire/circus performer from Detroit who's become frustrated with the state of led performance tools. I used to work in the theatrical/concert industry as a lighting engineer. Going from a performance where I have complete control of what my lights do to whatever flowtoys or another company programmed into the chip frustrates me. So i want to make a universal design for creating LED toys that can be programmed with a laptop and sent wirelessly to you're toy so that every LED on your toy does want you want it to, at the speed you want it to, when you want it to, and without you having to worry about anything other than moving your toy the way you want to. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If I can accomplish this, these tools would help bring the level of quality, creativity, and fun of performing to whole new levels! Just imagine if you could make your toys change color at just the right time in the song, or flash a rainbow then go to one color without you pressing anything. You and your toy become a synchronous light show! The quality of LED toys today is, in my opinion, pathetic when compared to what we can do, we've just needed someone to want to make this possible, and i want to be that person.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need to do this is simply capital for supplies. I don't want to be paid for the time or energy put into this, I just need help buying all the parts to put together and then making designs to make everything more affordable to everyone. I want these tools to be available to all performers who can afford them (unlike other LED tools that do POV company logos). </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Other ways you can help is if you have any spares of the supplies needed that you'd be willing to donate. Here's a list of the ones that could be donated.</p>

<p>Through supporting this campaign, you'll help save sea turtles, as well as contribute to the continued support and development of Next.</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------<br/>Thanks to our previous backers we've been able to add cross-platform support, ad-blocking, VI-keybindings, a download manager, and improved stability/performance via a massive architectural change. You can try it out here: <a href=""https://next.atlas.engineer/download"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://next.atlas.engineer/download</a></p>
<p>We're working on our next major release which includes many new features:</p>
<p>- Smart searching across all tabs<br/>- A package manager and repository for users to share useful packages<br/>- Per tab isolation, proxy, and Tor support<br/>- Live fuzzy search- everywhere<br/>- Improved macOS performance<br/>... And much more, see the full list below.</p>
<h3>Why Funding?</h3>
<p>-----------------------------------------------<br/>Most of the funding for the project has been coming out of our own pockets, but additional support will be very helpful, as our resources are limited. The funding you provide will help keep the project alive and allow us to maintain a focus on building a better browser, concretely, the funding will be used for:</p>
<p>- Developer time<br/>- Server time<br/>- Domain name costs<br/>- Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the bottom 2 layers (food and shelter)</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>-----------------------------------------------<br/>Next has been a passion project for almost three years. It arose out of a need to create a web browser more useful for something beyond merely ""browsing"". Modern browsers have eschewed power in favor of simplicity. This has led to a compromise in their capability.</p>
<p>Next tips the power balance the other way. Next is not designed for the common denominator, but rather for the expert tool user. It is infinitely customizable, and designed to make you more productive, in whatever you do.</p>

</div></div>","Through supporting this campaign, you'll help save sea turtles, as well as contribute to the continued support and development of Next.
-----------------------------------------------Thanks to our previous backers we've been able to add cross-platform support, ad-blocking, VI-keybindings, a download manager, and improved stability/performance via a massive architectural change. You can try it out here: https://next.atlas.engineer/download
We're working on our next major release which includes many new features:
- Smart searching across all tabs- A package manager and repository for users to share useful packages- Per tab isolation, proxy, and Tor support- Live fuzzy search- everywhere- Improved macOS performance... And much more, see the full list below.
Why Funding?
-----------------------------------------------Most of the funding for the project has been coming out of our own pockets, but additional support will be very helpful, as our resources are limited. The funding you provide will help keep the project alive and allow us to maintain a focus on building a better browser, concretely, the funding will be used for:
- Developer time- Server time- Domain name costs- Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the bottom 2 layers (food and shelter)
The Impact
-----------------------------------------------Next has been a passion project for almost three years. It arose out of a need to create a web browser more useful for something beyond merely ""browsing"". Modern browsers have eschewed power in favor of simplicity. This has led to a compromise in their capability.
Next tips the power balance the other way. Next is not designed for the common denominator, but rather for the expert tool user. It is infinitely customizable, and designed to make you more productive, in whatever you do.
