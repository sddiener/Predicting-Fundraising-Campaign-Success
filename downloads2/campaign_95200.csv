<p>To give you some context, I will discuss our background. Our company was started by 8 shareholders all with one question: Why don't more people invest in the stock market? As investors and analysts ourselves, it seemed easy, assess the market, find undervalued stocks, and boom, invest. It wasn't until we pitched the idea to our programmer that we realized people lack an understanding of stock market basics. We were in a conversation when he asked us, ""what is a stock?"" At that point, we set out some easy to read modules that would help people understand the stock market, how stocks are traded, and some entry level strategies that we used when we first got started. We also show people how to get set up with a brokerage, all for free. While this information is publicly available, it does take time to sift through and understand. We make it so easy that a sixth grader could understand it. The same services will be offered for cryptocurrency. Our modules aren't long, boring, and bogged down with extraneous details. We show people a rudimentary understanding of trading. After reading our modules, our users can look at a stock (or coin) on their watchlist and say, ""hey I know what all of these terms mean."" </p>
<p>We also thought it would be a neat idea to show people some of our own picks, strategies, and opinions on trades. Of course there are people doing something similar. We looked at similar services out there, and most come in anywhere from $70-$400 per month. The cheapest we found was motley fool, coming in at a 50% sale price of $45 annually. We found some free ones too, with slogans like ""our penny stocks will make you 300% today!"" We came to realize that many of these services prey on the desperate, people wanting to get rich quick and quit their day jobs. The truth is, there are no get rich quick schemes. BUT, there are ways to make solid annual returns between 10%-80% annually if you know what you're doing. This is where we set ourselves apart. We brought on three analysts with degrees in finance and economics at the University of Texas at Austin to examine blue-chip stocks and ETFs. We decided to show people what WE do ourselves to give them an idea of how to work the market. We rate our ideas on a low, medium, and high risk scale so that newcomers can choose a strategy that works for them. We vowed to never pitch penny stocks, shorting,weed stocks, risky IPOs, or ICOs. We believe too many services pitch these speculative trades, having catastrophic consequences for their subscribers.</p>
<p>We want online trading to work for everyone the right way with minimal risk.</p>
<p>Therefore, we have geared our services to the common person. For an affordable $5.99 per month users will get access to ALL picks, ALL strategies, and ALL newsletters distributed on a monthly basis.  Further, we offer a yearly subscription for $35, and a 6 month subscription for $20. WE POST NO ADS ON FREE OR SUBSCRIBER CONTENT, WE PROMOTE NO BROKERAGES, WE DO NOT PROMOTE OUR OWN TRADES, AND WE AVOID GAMBLES. We do not promote bonus content, because we have NONE.

<p>Are you one who does a lot of research online before making a decision? Wouldn’t it be more efficient and convenient to have a site where you could type your question and receive a data-driven answer?</p>
<p>Smarter Life Decisions is the answer to these questions.</p>
<h2>How will this project help you?</h2>
<p>In recent times research has involved going to Google or to the library and spending hours gathering data, then using software tools like Excel to clean and analyze the data and finally put the data together in aesthetically pleasing charts. With Smarter Life Decisions, this whole process will be automated so that you can get insightful data on your commute in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The digital infographics will be high resolution such that you could print it out in poster size if you want to present the insights or display throughout your home or office.</p>
<p>Our effort will help people by finding quick insightful answers to some of their common day-to-day questions like,</p>
<ul>
<li>Which neighborhoods have the lowest crime rates and cheapest housing in the city I’m moving to?</li>
<li>What is the average income in my city and what percentage of that income do people usually save?</li>
<li>What are the top 20 colleges for my interests and what is their annual tuition fee?</li>
<li>What are the top stocks last year that had high returns and low volatility?</li>

Let yourself be surprised. Extensive technical studies have allowed us to understand and rethink some aspects of the application of technology, of how some electronic components communicate with each other and how the optimization of various processes could lead to incredibly useful results in the field of computer science and consequently in the people's lives. In the last 30 years we have seen two categories of computers that have taken hold both in the home and in the professional field: On the one hand we have desktop computers and on the other hand we have portable computers.Everyone knows the main advantages of a desktop computer compared to a laptop: computing power, component interchangeability, component durability.On the other hand, laptops only offer the possibility of having a computer always powered by battery in tight spaces and reduced weights, but giving up the peculiarities of a fixed computer.This is where our idea comes from: being able to have the characteristics of a desktop computer in spaces and weights of a laptop, so as to have the perfect computer.Thanks to our 300Watt card everything is possible!In fact, it manages to convert any motherboard from a fixed computer to a laptop, adding not only a battery pack, but also a power off function with data saving (our proprietary software, when reaching a critical percentage of the batteries, will make the computer saving data).In this way we can finally have the best of both worlds, namely: power, interchangeability and the durability of the components combined with portability with reduced space and weight.We have engineered and prototyped a new way of feeding ... not just computers.A 12V board with power up to 25A, which can be parallelised to obtain even greater power + One Pico PSU 160 XT 160W = One of the smallest and most powerful Fanless power supplies on the market.This power supply, applied to desktop computers, allows you to work away from the power outlet and in any location; moreover the parallelized card can become even more powerful.There is also a 12v rear connection, to which it is possible to attach an optional inverter with a shuko socket to be able to power an external Lcd monitor or other accessories up to a maximum of 200 Watts via the internal battery of the transformer.However Power 300 combines the peculiarities of a 160 Watt Pico Psu with an integrated UPS with battery pack high capacity lithium.

<h3><strong>#THE PUSHER</strong></h3>
<p><u><strong>INCLUSIVE DESIGN</strong></u></p>
<p>Inclusive design with Braille letters on its surface, allowing blind people the best service experience.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>SOLAR POWERED</strong></u></p>
<p>The Caller's integrated solar panel on the bottom, charges its internal battery for energy independence. In case charging is necessary, just place the Caller upside down in the light (sunlight is the most recommended light source = its free and doesn't hurt any tree).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551224062/xpf5jalw5u1rghoszfky.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The fully charged pusher battery gives autonomy for up to 600 transmissions. A complete charge at the sunlight takes approx. 3 hours (depending on sun intensity). We recommend to charge every day to increase battery lifetime. Our lifetime tests confirm at least 10 years battery lifetime.</p>
<p>If sunlight is not available you can just take a 5W LED lamp and put it on top for charging.</p>

#THE PUSHER
INCLUSIVE DESIGN
Inclusive design with Braille letters on its surface, allowing blind people the best service experience.

 
VERSATILE
The pusher is available in different colors for best fit into its surrounding (either elegant or modern).

 
SOLAR POWERED
The Caller's integrated solar panel on the bottom, charges its internal battery for energy independence. In case charging is necessary, just place the Caller upside down in the light (sunlight is the most recommended light source = its free and doesn't hurt any tree).

The fully charged pusher battery gives autonomy for up to 600 transmissions. A complete charge at the sunlight takes approx. 3 hours (depending on sun intensity). We recommend to charge every day to increase battery lifetime. Our lifetime tests confirm at least 10 years battery lifetime.
If sunlight is not available you can just take a 5W LED lamp and put it on top for charging.

 
#Central Unit
Operates like a small computer and manages all functions

 
The Central Unit contains various Functions and Communication Interfaces:
Reading of RFID tags, for setup of Caller (Caller integrated) and for waiter to confirm fulfilled request (using personal waiter RFID TAG):
 
Analyze Staff Performance
Overall Performance - Compare Staff Member Performance - Analyze Individual Performance

 
The Premium Central Unit contains in addition some automation functions, which we consider suitable for Service Areas.

Brief description of the added automation functions:
-Light Control: For all lamps using DALI/0-10/PWM interface protocol, control each lamp individually, or create a group of lamps and control them together (Premium only)

Our last solution to ease of use if the assemble method with most scanners of the same price bracket as HALO, no one wants to spend upwards of 90-120 minutes assembling there scanning, so in response our system comes out of the box in only 2 parts, yes 2 parts. HALO only requires 1 screw and 1 cable to be attached and the rest which normally would be left to you is done by us  inhouse by hand before shipping. </p>
<p><strong>50% in house production:</strong></p>
<p>As we have said we make all non electrical components in house with our cnc machines and 3d printing farm. This lowers the cost per unit to a realistic price never before seen from a company. With only electrical items being sourced from respectable companies we have very little outsourcing to pay for, which again is another saving for you.</p>
<p><strong>Aftercare: </strong></p>
<p>Each HALO scanner is hand assembled in house with each component being checked and double checked. Calibration tests and basic setup is done before shipping, we hope this extra dedication to customer service shows are love of HALO. </p>

With only electrical items being sourced from respectable companies we have very little outsourcing to pay for, which again is another saving for you.
Aftercare: 
Each HALO scanner is hand assembled in house with each component being checked and double checked. Calibration tests and basic setup is done before shipping, we hope this extra dedication to customer service shows are love of HALO. 
We have many plans to bring to market upgradeable components to keep the HALO relevant and bring you personal custom configurations, again cheap as possible.
We are happy to say that HALO will be a long lasting system, and will help you do great things.

STRETCH GOALS:
65K upgradeable  arms
If HALO was able to achieve this we would be able to implement the first upgrade for HALO.
Each HALO backer will be receive the upgraded adjustable LED arms kit to help with low light, which will assist for sharper scans.
90k upgradeable beds
If we can reach this milestone we will be able to design and implement the upgradeable sized scanning beds and support base for greater scan volume, including 15cm 25cm and 40cm. I bet you didn’t see that coming, interchangeable beds.
120k video tutorial 
This goal will let us hire and produce a first class tutorial, not just how to assemble but to troubleshooting and how to get the best scans from HALO as well.
200k custom software
Besides from fainting, if this amount can be achieved then everything will change.
We will be able to achieve our own purpose built software to include better cameras and many more features.
 

Time Table Not 100% set.
 
Risks:
 
We hope that anyone wanting to help fund this will understand that certain situations may affect final scan quality, such as certain colours and different surfaces types.We have done everything we can to include details and steps to get that perfect scan.We are putting every effort to get the best prices and quality components for HALO, but there may be times when parts don't meet quality expectations which may in turn delay deliveries.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

paper – NO LAG and NO OFFSET, Open Source

Have you ever experienced lagging when writing on paper? Of course not!
So why should you experience that on the digital version of it? –
The Diginote has no laggy operating system and it feels just like writing on
paper:
Common Writing Tablet                 vs             DIGINOTE




Have you ever experienced having an offset when writing on
paper? Of course not!

You won’t experience that on the DIGINOTE too:

Use the Diginote with any ballpoint-pen you want:
If you don't like the standard stylus for the diginote, you can also choose to take a ballpoint pen-tip instead, so that you can use it with any of your favorite ball point pens.

<p>My name is Kadron Gregory and I am a electronic engineer. I design smart devices and also specialised in Software programming. The Smart Gas Detector came out of  personal experience - one night I woke to the house filled with gas scent and I realised that there are smoke and carbon detectors around but no gas detector. If one was in the kitchen then I would instantly be aware there is a gas leak. I then embarked on a mission to put gas detector on the market. With your help, this can become a reality and also to purchase the right tools to make it happen.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521444866/ff3ci6upj774rnusglsz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The smart detector is phase one of many phases of this project with the end result becoming a fully blown home automation system.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Need</u></strong></p>
<p>Smoke detectors are an almost universal feature in newer US  and UK homes and apartment construction. In many locales, smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are required features under applicable county construction, fire, and/or occupancy codes. They are almost universally required by local codes or applicable insurance policies for rental property.</p>
<p>Because of increased emphasis on energy conservation, many homes while not airtight have severely restricted air circulation. This can be especially problematic in older, rehabilitated homes as well as mobile homes with well insulated and closed off crawlspaces, whose formally open crawlspaces have become practically airtight. With limited air circulation in home spaces, an increasing danger of gas accumulation exists. While this danger has been recognized as to natural radon in many homes, less attention has been paid to natural gas and propane used for heating and in kitchen ranges and ovens over much of the country.</p>
<p><br/><strong><u>The Solution</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520673110/d0ozqgweahgrblkxlq3q.jpg"" src=""""/></u></strong></p>
<p> The capability of combined smoke, carbon monoxide, natural gas, and propane detectors seems intuitive, but has not been encountered. A detector coupled to an exhaust system to extract and dissipate dangerous flammable gasses as well as carbon monoxide could prevent many deaths and provide warning to building occupants. For example, the first notice that many people have of a propane or natural gas leak occurs when smelled in another area of a home only after explosive concentration of gas are reached in other isolated home areas.</p>

The first and second plurality of building locations comprise at least one of an attic, a main floor, a basement, and a crawl space.
The multi-gas detector comprises a LED light generating a visual indicator of the gas detected and a speaker generating an audible alarm.

The LED light comprises a plurality of electroluminescent LED wires providing a different color alarm indicator for each type of gas detectable by the detector.
The control panel display provides a graphical user interface.
The gas detection system further comprises a remote controller with a wireless communication link to the control panel.
The remote controller further comprises a mobile device configured by a software application to interface with the control panel.
A multi-gas detector in a building location that comprises a plurality of internal gas detectors in communication with an atmosphere of the building location detecting at least four gases. A speaker in the interior of the multi-gas detector that generates an audible alarm when the plurality of internal gas detectors detects gas. A LED visual indicator that illuminates a specific color LED associated with a specific detected gas. An exhaust fan controller to activate an exhaust fan to evacuate detected gas in the building location.

There are at least four gases are selected from a group comprising smoke, butane, propane, natural gas, and carbon monoxide. Advantages: 1. Improved detection of fuel gas leaks. 2. Improved protection from carbon monoxide poisoning. 3. Improved protection from smoke inhalation. 4. Improved fire safety. 5. Reduced incidence of fires and property damage, injury, or death due to fires.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Despite the fact that we live in the digital era, many people still prefer to make notes in traditional way—using pen and paper.  Writing by hand helps boost our ability to understand and memory as well, more so than typing on electronic devices when it comes to note-making.</p>
<p>However, conventional pulp paper itself has two most common problems:<br/>(1.) not waterproof, and<br/>(2.) vulnerable to bookworms,<br/>let alone the deforestation and the pollution that we might hardly be aware of caused by pulp and paper industry. </p>
<p>After almost 20 years of research and development, we are proud to introduce you stone paper, a revolutionary material that can safely keep your notes from any accidental splashes of water* or unwelcome bookworms.  Stone paper is smooth and silky, so writing on stone paper will bring you pleasures like never before. We need your help to spread the good news!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515741379/d0rzxxipstfghsxsgkjz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And that is not all.  We use stone paper to make Rock Book, a wood-pulp-free notebook, meaning that no trees will be cut to make inner pages.  Unlike some high-end notebooks using genuine leather as cover, we use stone paper to make the cover, meaning that no animals will be harmed.  And not only that, the cover comes with modern and sleek embossed geometric pattern, giving the notebook a luxurious look like many high-end notebooks with embossed leather cover, so you can bring Rock Book to every occasion, including business meetings, without hesitation.</p>
<p>In other words, Rock Book is a notebook entirely made of stone paper, ideal for many environmentalists and animal lovers.  Because stone paper does not contain any residues of harsh chemicals such as bleaches used in the production of conventional tree-pulp paper, Rock Book is perfectly safe to use.  These are just some of the many reasons why Rock Book is a Red Dot Award 2016 winner.  If you do not know what stone paper is, we urge you to try this book and discover how stone paper can elevate your handwriting experience.</p>

Meet the (super)woman behind The Bulletproof Business Planner
who has been featured in
and many more
As a web designer and business efficiency coach who runs multiple businesses, I have over 10 years of experience organizing, strengthening, and streamlining businesses into profitability and success. 

I was born and raised in Germany where I caught the entrepreneurial bug early on, working in my parents’ business and owning my own pub at age of 22.
I left the safety net and security she had in Germany to pursue my own dreams.
Since moving to the US in 2007, my goal has been to help empower entrepreneurs so they can successfully run a sustainable business while also enjoying life. 


My own life-changing challenge came in 2014, when I lost my husband to cancer. I was determined to resume my passion of building “bulletproof businesses” that can withstand anything. 
Nearly losing everything kickstarted my passion for efficiency
In September 2014, my husband and former agency CEO lost his battle to cancer. The years leading up to that moment were full of ups and downs as I became his caretaker while running his business and my own consulting firm. Every minute counted during those times, and I knew there had to be a better way to manage it all (let’s face it - who has time to fill in two pages on a 3 month goal planner and then round around with 4 planners…)
After constant chaos with no idea how to organize my goals, money, health, and ultimately, happiness, I decided it was time to take control.
I was ready to become the Badass Superwoman inside of me.
After searching and searching through journals, planners, apps, calendars, gurus, and trainings, I just couldn’t find it, so I decided to build it: I bulletproofed my business.
Your new best friend, teammate, and stylish ally.

<p>and love using keyboards and trackpads in the office. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I travel a lot, I need to bring my MacBook every time, and I like to use iPad for entertainment. Therefore, I have to carry an iPad and MacBook, which will be troublesome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With the release of the iPad os, I designed a protective case with a Bluetooth keyboard and trackpad. It can increase office productivity without problems. Many games can be played during entertainment. This product is so exciting that I want more people like me to use it.</p>

<h3><strong>Introducing CleanTouch by jk</strong></h3>
<p>CleanTouch is an useful EDC (everyday carry) that is ergonomically designed to be used for public doors, locks, touch screens and elevator buttons. Washing hands are extremely important after touching shared surfaces but when you don't have an immediate access to wash your hands, CleanTouch EDC can reduce the point-of-contact area and keep your hands clean!</p>
<p>CleanTouch is machined from antimicrobial brass to stop germ growth! Researchers have discovered that copper and alloys made of it, including brass, can prevent antibiotic resistance in bacteria from spreading. </p>
<p><strong>CleanTouch is manufactured individually by CNC machine so we can produce it with the beautiful curves and angles.  </strong></p>

<h3><strong>Why Brass?</strong></h3>
<p>Brass has been used for thousands of years for sterilization as the composition of brass is 70% copper and 30% zinc.  The Environmental Protection Agency has registered copper, brass and bronze as antimicrobial and is allowing public health claims to be made about their effectiveness against Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, E. coli O157:H7, Enterobacter aerogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Copper alloys are a supplement to existing infection control practices and are not a replacement for good hygiene and surface disinfection. (copper.org)</p>
<p>Many of the microbes that make us sick can live on hard surfaces for up to four or five days. When we touch those surfaces, the microbes can make it into our bodies through our nose, mouth, or eyes, and infect us.</p>
<p>On copper/brass surfaces, bacteria and viruses die. When a microbe lands on a copper surface, the copper releases ions, which are electrically charged particles. Those copper ions blast through the outer membranes and destroy the whole cell, including the DNA or RNA inside. Because their DNA and RNA are destroyed, it also means a bacteria or virus can’t mutate and become resistant to the copper, or pass on genes (like for antibiotic resistance) to other microbes.""

<h3>How it works?</h3>
<p>Each user will have the possibility to either download our platform or log in to it directly on our website. Uploading data will have two functions: Quick access upload, for data that you use daily or want to be able to access it instantly and Blockchain safe keep upload where your data will be spread across the world, encrypted. Both options will use the blockchain security, however, for the quick access option, half of the data will be stored on our servers for the sync to be instant. (We recommend to use Blockchain safe keep for files that you value the most). The sync time for files send fully to blockchain will be in the matter of seconds. </p>
<ul>
<li>User signs-up. </li>
<li>Chooses one of two options and uploads data.</li>

</div><p>The future is now.</p></div>","How it works?
Each user will have the possibility to either download our platform or log in to it directly on our website. Uploading data will have two functions: Quick access upload, for data that you use daily or want to be able to access it instantly and Blockchain safe keep upload where your data will be spread across the world, encrypted. Both options will use the blockchain security, however, for the quick access option, half of the data will be stored on our servers for the sync to be instant. (We recommend to use Blockchain safe keep for files that you value the most). The sync time for files send fully to blockchain will be in the matter of seconds. 

User signs-up. 
Chooses one of two options and uploads data.
Data reaches our server where it is split, encrypted, backed up multiple times and sent to the blockchain to miners throughout the world in a constant change. 
When user signs in and want to access his data, either he will have access to what is in quick access or will hit the sync button which will send a request to the blockchain. 
In seconds, a copy of the data will be retrieved in a temporary memory on our servers, where it will be decrypted and ready to use by the user. At the same time of retrieving a copy of data, a new backup will take it's place on the blockchain for safe keeping.
After logging out, the temporary memory will be deleted automatically. 
When the user decides to delete his data, it will have an option to destroy everything or select the files that wants to be removed. No trace will be left. 


Step by step plan:

Creating online and downloadable platform.
Creating an ICO and developing a coin for payments to the miners and getting it listed on all major exchanges. 
Creating our servers and buying all the necessary equipment.
Marketing.
Revolutionising the cloud storage conception.

A new way of organizing your pinboard without making any holes on your items. With well designed two different pieces, you can use your imagination to attache any kind of document or some product.



How does it work?

L shaped and I shaped pieces let you create pockets.


Pockets can be at any size. You just need to arrange the amount of pieces.


Any kind of geometric shape would work with Pinn’t without any problem.


With the help of gravity, you can Drop&Go your stuff into Pinn’t Pocket.

The pocket you designed does not need to be broken every time you need the document or item attached. 

That’s Pinn’t!
Pieces are 3 cm x 3 cm squares.

Square piece has 3 mm thickness and there are 2 mm pocket depth.




That is how far we have come so far. Samples on visuals are made from plexy-glass with hand. The final product will look the same but will be from plastic with metal nails and be perfect.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am the inventor of multilevel authentication.</p>
<p>I have developed this with a small team over the last 10 years.</p>
<p>Proper authentication is critical to provide trust, certainty and privacy in communications and transactions on the internet.</p>
<p>By assisting us to bring this new authentication service to the internet you will be helping to build to peace and harmony in the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We want to build and host the password vault and retrofit our new authentication to replace legacy authentication on a supporting second factor email service.</p>
<p>This will allow you secure authentication without having to rely on any device.</p>
<p>Supporters will receive lifetime access to the service.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our target we will try to maximise the reach of the service to the extent we can starting with the Americas, then Australasia, then Eurasia and so on depending on the support we receive.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our authentication service will prevent billions of dollars of fraud that is occurring around the world from stolen credentials.</p>
<p>We have built a full production service with transaction validation at </p>
<p><a href=""https://safetrade.market"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://safetrade.market</a></p>
<p>We have the working solution we need your assistance to scale it for the benefit of all internet users.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>My family and I have had to make great sacrifices to make this technology available and we have had to endure many years of persecution by Government and ridicule and indifference from so called industry experts but we have never the less prevailed and successfully built our system.</p>
<p>It is ready to scale for the security and safety of all internet users and will also protect the networks of those same Governments and Industry that have tried to deny our progress.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can help us by telling people about our technology and by registering on our production site <a href=""https://safetrade.market"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://safetrade.market</a> and listing some items you have to sell to provide us with support.</p>

Proper authentication is critical to provide trust, certainty and privacy in communications and transactions on the internet.
By assisting us to bring this new authentication service to the internet you will be helping to build to peace and harmony in the world.

What We Need & What You Get
We want to build and host the password vault and retrofit our new authentication to replace legacy authentication on a supporting second factor email service.
This will allow you secure authentication without having to rely on any device.
Supporters will receive lifetime access to the service.
If we don't reach our target we will try to maximise the reach of the service to the extent we can starting with the Americas, then Australasia, then Eurasia and so on depending on the support we receive.

The Impact
Our authentication service will prevent billions of dollars of fraud that is occurring around the world from stolen credentials.
We have built a full production service with transaction validation at 
https://safetrade.market
We have the working solution we need your assistance to scale it for the benefit of all internet users.

Risks & Challenges
My family and I have had to make great sacrifices to make this technology available and we have had to endure many years of persecution by Government and ridicule and indifference from so called industry experts but we have never the less prevailed and successfully built our system.
It is ready to scale for the security and safety of all internet users and will also protect the networks of those same Governments and Industry that have tried to deny our progress.

Other Ways You Can Help
You can help us by telling people about our technology and by registering on our production site https://safetrade.market and listing some items you have to sell to provide us with support.

<p>After more than 10 years as a Customer / Guest support specialist I have decided to start a StartUp and offer to every hotel, first in Dublin then Ireland, and after that Europe and the rest of the world FREE Staff Collaboration Tool. </p>
<p>It is not a new Idea, there is a lot of really good hotel tools, they are complex and do a good job, so what makes my idea stands out? </p>
<p>In particular, you don't need a brilliant idea to start a startup around. The way a startup makes money is to offer people better technology than they have now. But what people have now is often so bad that it doesn't take brilliance to do better. Google's plan, for example, was simply to create a search site that didn't suck.</p>
<p>FDA is a staff collaboration tool, like many others, but totally FREE for hotels and planned and developed for staff and guests. Why free for hotel? Well it is simple, hotels need to approve that software and if they need to spend money on it the staff will stay with their paper notebooks and pencils. </p>
<p>Imagine a full-time assistant who would efficiently track anything happening in your hotel, from complaints, maintenance tasks, events, lost &amp; found items to the morning checklist and who would work 24/7 to make sure nothing was missed. </p>
<p>What would that mean to you and your hotel? </p>
<ul>
<li>Zero miscommunication mistakes </li>
<li>40% to 60% fewer emails, calls and texts </li>
<li>Real time alerts on trending issues and deadlines </li>

We believe that the life of wood can be passed on through artifacts.We hope to bring our most exquisite design and appreciation to everyone. We sincerely hope that we can take this opportunity to become friends with all those who have the same passion for wood art, and we can share our ideas and enjoy together in the future.DesignThe Forbidden City is the largest and most complete group of ancient architectural structures in China. Our Crown Minimal Fountain Pen is inspired by the classic design of the top part of the architecture of the Forbidden City. Our ingnuinely-designed pen end is not only just a palace, but also a crown，to satisfy our nostalgic feelings.""Let the cultural relics in royal collections, the heritage displays on the ground, and the writings in the ancient books all come to life"", to make history and tradition more vigorous, and to bring ancient architectural culture to everyone's desk.MaterialsStabilized MahoganyWe name it the Rainbow Wood. Generally, the surface of wood is painted by color spraying, while the rainbow wood is immersed in a natural dye under high temperature and pressure for a long time, and is colored both inside and outside. Only the hundred-year-old tree nodules are selected as basic wood, which has a natural and beautiful texture, with unevenly distributed pattern, so that the immersed wood not only maintains a pleasant-looking texture, but also has contrast in the shades of color depth.EbonyEbony is a dense black hardwood, smooth and full of luster. It is finely textured and has a mirror finish when polished, making it valuable as an ornamental wood.The pen end is made of brass, vintage and gorgeous, which also gives the pen more weight to enhances the grip feeling. The pen cap can be easily put on the pen end, so you don't have to worry about losing it. Specially inlaid with copper anti-rolling nail, it is also a decoration other than the function.Nibs & RefillsThe soul of a fountain pen lies in the choice of nib, so we chose a long-established German brand (SCHMIDT) to complete this most important part. F nib, 0.5mm, with an appropriate stroke width and flowing writingThe gift box comes with our delicate ink pouch, which contains 6 German standard Schneider ink sacs. Dye-type ink has the advantages of bright colors, good transparency, and anti-clogging after long-term use.SpecificationSmall, Practical, Portable and Light.Total length: 88 mm / 3.46""Uncapped length (with nib): 113 mm / 4.45""Grip width: 15 mm / 0.59""Weight: 28gPacketingWe use renewable high-grade cardboard as the material of the gift box. This cardboard is hard and flat, has good uniformity, is not easy to deform in any climate, and can maintain flatness. The pattern on the gift box adopts the traditional Chinese auspicious cloud design, which implies goodness and wishes the recipients lucky and happy.Perfect giftGive it to family or friends to show respect and gratitude.Gift it to colleagues or business partners to wish a happy cooperation.Gift it between couples to record the bits and pieces of love with a pen, which means that love will always be remembered in the heart.WritingAlthough we have matched our pen with the most suitable nib, you can still change the nib according to your personal habits to meet the best result.RewardCrown Minimal Fountain Pen gift box, including single pen and ink pouch.One choice of color from Palace red, Glaze green, Royal blue and Basalt black.Crown Minimal Fountain Pen premium box, including single pen, ink pouch and a luxury notebook.The notebook uses beige PU cover, which has a leather texture and is very durable.

When he or she passes there, he or she will discover there's a video for him or her!And you can simply use it as an advertisement for your business, you can name it as your business name, place a promoting video and pin it! Why do we need your fund?-AR techniqueWe would like to use the AR technique in our video recording function, to make sure you can separate with the background in the video you shoot and your image will overlay on the environment in the camera when others open your StoARy video at the same place.It is not an easy function for us, therefore, we need your help to make sure the app is user-friendly and works. Risks & ChallengesThere are many famous social media in the world, they have billions of users and are rich enough to add many new functions every day.It's easy for them to make a new app like StoARy, even the concepts may be different to their company. We have to be fast to do it earlier than others, although we spend all our time to work it in progress, we still cannot get enough support in any aspect.

<h3>What is My Bible</h3>
<p>My Bible is a classically-designed notebook in the form of a bible: 1,280 blank pages for writing and drawing whatever you want. Follow your own inspiration.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549985110/cqcvlgkhiciwccl9izu9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My Bible was designed in the exact same way as a bible. Have you ever asked yourself why bibles are the way they are? Their primary characteristic is the type of paper they use, which is opaque and very thin, as well as durable in terms of tearing, pulling and folding, making it possible to print more than 1,000 pages in one tome. Bible paper was invented for this purpose: to print all the books of the bible in a single volume.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549985702/jpgmwtrmqijtdcdykm84.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>If we apply the same idea to the world of notebooks, then making them out of the thinner bible paper has the enormous advantage of taking up less volume than the regular paper used in conventional notebooks. In addition to bibles, this type of paper – which is ideal for printing – is typically used for large and high-quality books that require frequent use and reduced weight.</p>
<p> My Bible can be used for note taking, drawing and sketching, as an agenda or a diary, for studying or work, as a project notebook, a travel journal, or any number of other things. </p>

<p>A conventional notebook has between 100 and 200 pages. My Bible has 1,280: the equivalent of approximately ten conventional notebooks. It will last a lifetime and its classical design means it will never go out of style.</p>

<p>This notebook has the same number of pages as ten conventional notebooks. Imagine being able to quickly access your notes, drawings or reflections from years past, all in one place. You can use any type of pens or pencils to write in My Bible, and although it will show through slightly when you use fountain pens, markers or gel pens, you will still be able to write on both sides of the paper. If you use a kind of pen that requires you to exert pressure to write, it will give the paper a very special texture. </p>
<p>Meticulously designed to be just like a bible – the book with more copies printed than any other book in history – the notebook’s characteristics are as follows:  </p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> 1,280 pages, or 640 sheets of paper; ten times more than a conventional notebook.    <br/><br/><strong>2. </strong>Very thin and resistant bible paper: 8lb Bond (30 gr/m2). The low weight and thinness of the paper is the true secret behind My Bible. <br/><br/><strong>3. </strong>The front and back, flyleafs and endpapers are black.<br/><br/><strong>4. </strong>Its dimensions are 4,5* 6,8*1,5 inches (11.5 *17.5 *4 cm). These measurements were meticulously calculated to give it the ideal size of a desktop notebook, while also making it the perfect size for taking to meetings or on trips. It weighs 26 oz (725 grams). <br/><br/><strong>5. </strong>The cover is 1/8 ″ (2.5 mm) thick and lined with PU synthetic leather.  <br/> </p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> The words “My Bible” are embossed onto the cover and spine.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>7. </strong>The edges of the pages have been gilded, like those of traditional bibles.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> It has a black ribbon bookmark, which makes it easy to mark the last page you’ve used.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> A rounded spine that makes it possible to open the book completely.  <br/> </p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> A beautiful cardboard box to protect the notebook.  </p>

<h3>How did the project come about?</h3>
<p>The idea came out of our love of notebooks. However, we’ve seen how they can pile up over the years, occupying too much space. At the same time, it’s never easy to go back and find ideas that were written down years ago. We’ve been wondering for some time if it would be possible to make a single notebook that could last a lifetime. The problem is the same one that printing companies once had when faced with printing the Bible. Is it possible to fit the contents of four or five books into one conventionally-sized book?</p>
<p>The solution was bible paper, a paper that is very light, just 8lb Bond (30 gr/m2) and extremely resistant. Another great addition to My Bible is the ribbon bookmark – we don’t understand how notebooks can exist without one! It is the easiest way to find the last page with writing on it, and both an elegant and functional solution.</p>
<p>The biggest motivation for creating My Bible was that we don’t like cheap products that don’t stand the test of time. My Bible can last for years, so just imagine being able to consult things that you wrote down four years ago. We don't want to seem pretentious, but My Bible is a notebook to last a lifetime.</p>
<p>Another motivation for creating My Bible was to recover the pleasure of writing by hand, of drawing and writing on paper. The feel and sounds of the pages in My Bible are both evocative and addictive.</p>

<p>Our philosophy is different from all other competing products and services. Instead of building a single purpose device, we have decided to leverage the power of open-source hardware and build an appliance, which loves interoperability. We have concentrated our efforts on simplicity, robustness, cost and ability to work with as many existing systems and devices as possible. And thus we came up with the BYOC (Bring Your Own Camera) concept, where you can use any commercially available USB or IP camera with Guacam - indoor, outdoor, night-vision or thermal; it's your choice. Our platform is based on popular and easily available hardware and can be assembled by almost anyone. We have also built into the system a wide array of video- and audio-based detections, which leverage feeds from your cameras to bring you a real-time situational awareness of your house and surroundings.</p>

<h2 style=""margin-top: 30px; border-bottom: 1px solid #2aa928;"">What's Guacam All About?</h2>
<p><b>Simplicity:</b> Guacam consists of two parts: Guabox, a smart-home appliance and a cloud platform, which stores and processes events. That's it. Our installation wizard will guide you through a simple deployment process at your house or any other location you wish to monitor.</p>
<p><b>Robustness:</b> Our algorithms are hardened and tested. We have been running them for over twelve months and many tweaks and adjustments have been made to minimize false alarms. The last thing we want is to release a buggy software.</p>
<p><b>Biggest bang for your buck:</b> Guacam is affordable. We have built the monitoring app to work as a camera hub. No need to purchase security-system-specific cameras. Guabox comes with one built-in camera and beyond that you can BYOC: buy any off-the-shelf IP or USB camera, hook it up to Guacam and voila! You have a multi-camera monitoring system.</p>
<p><b>Security:</b> Guacam is secure. The technology we are using to deliver live and archive video uses the only encrypted video delivery protocol currently available. And of course we use HTTPS for everything.</p>
<p><b>Flexibility:</b> Guacam can be used at home, at the office, on-the-go, anyway you like. Because Guacam is powered by a versatile app, you can turn any computer into a security system. You can also connect indoor and outdoor cameras, including cameras with PTZ control. You make the rules!</p>

<h2 style=""margin-top: 30px; border-bottom: 1px solid #2aa928;"">How It Works</h2>
<p>Guacam's monitoring app is a versatile piece of software, which runs on a computer inside your house. Whether it is your laptop, desktop or a specialized computer (like the Guabox), our app is easily deployed in any environment: Buy Guabox and put it on a shelf somewhere or download our app and install it on your home computer. That's it.</p>
<p>Once the application is installed, it tries to find all accessible cameras in its vicinity and starts pulling video feeds automatically. However you are in complete control since you can disable and delete any camera you don't want to use. You can also choose which cameras run detections on them and at what times of day.</p>

<p>Humans are forgetful creatures of habit. Without consciously realizing we cycle through numerous routines each day. <i>Did I turn the stove off? Did I forget to close the garage door?</i> Do these sound familiar to you? The universe does not provide us with one huge DVR box we could use to easily recall events from the past, but where the universe fails, Guacam succeeds. Guacam archives all your cameras and you get access to live and archive video no matter where you are. As long as you have internet access you can see your cameras.</p>

<p>We are also very curious and inquisitive creatures. <i>Who has has been eating all the ice cream late at night? Which neighbor is not cleaning up after their dog on my lawn? Who has been stealing my packages while I am at work?</i> These questions are easily answered by Guacam.

<h3>Detection Types</h3>
<p><b>Alarm on any motion</b> in the view of your camera or define specific interest zones. Imagine you keep finding dog poop on your lawn and you want to be alerted every time someone steps on your lawn, but not when someone walks on the adjacent sidewalk. You can define an interest zone within your camera's view with just few clicks. One camera can have multiple interest zones.</p>

<p>Guacam's monitoring app needs a dedicated piece of hardware, which it can call its home. Sure, you can run the app on your laptop or desktop computer, but we wanted an easy-to-use, small-footprint appliance as well. We thought long and hard about building custom hardware, but eventually decided against this idea. To minimize risk and shorten delivery time, we have set out to build Guabox on an exiting and widely available platform.</p>
<p>Guabox is based on the popular Raspberry Pi (version 2) ARM-based computer. Together with the HD wide-angle camera module and a handful of sensors, we were able to build a powerful, but affordable intelligent video monitoring appliance.</p>

<p>It all sounds simple: Take the Raspberry Pi (or Orange Pi or other comparable device), add to it full HD wide-angle camera, handful of useful sensors, our monitoring app and you have a powerful security appliance. Make it easy on the eyes by dressing it up in a nice looking enclosure and even The Guggenheim would not shy away from using it. To get here we had to solve many issues, optimize our code, pick the right camera module, create a small, yet feature-packed sensor board and fit all that into a slice of an avocado.</p>

<h3>Guabox Specs and Features</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448124159/wllgcrfrgfesu4vbk6yz.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 30px; border-bottom: 1px solid #2aa928;"">Guabox Models</h2>
<p>All Guabox models feature WiFi and USB ports, which can be used to extend video storage capabilities or plug in USB camera.</p>
<p><b>Guabox</b> - this model features an on-board camera, 32GB of built-in storage and is capable of processing 4 additional IP or USB cameras. If you need to deploy more than 5 cameras (one built-in and four external), not a problem. Simply stack more Guaboxes together. Put one in your living room, one in your garage and process a total of 10 cameras.</p>
<p><b>Guabox Pro</b> - a more powerful platform with Gigabit Ethernet, 1TB of built-in storage (expandable via USB), can handle up to 15 IP cameras for your maximum viewing pleasure. Guabox Pro is also stackable.</p>
<h3>More Sensors</h3>
<p>We are working on expanding the current capabilities of Guabox with additional set of sensors, which will be coupled together with the existing architecture. You can help us achieve this goal by funding this project. If we double our funding goal, we will build Guabox with passive IR, IR illuminators, humidity, vibration sensor and audio-out.</p>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 30px; border-bottom: 1px solid #2aa928;"">Feature Comparison</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448124124/mclguieo4jhrmg8ypf9d.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Guacam also features RESTful API interface. You can write your own extensions and scripts!</p>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 30px; border-bottom: 1px solid #2aa928;"">Open-Source Hardware Platform</h2>
<p>We did not set out to create a proprietary, single-purpose device. Guabox is built on hardware anyone can easily get, put together and recycle for another purpose if desired. The secret sauce is in our cross-platform monitoring app, which we give out for free. We provide an easy-to-follow tutorial on how you can put a Guabox together yourself using recommended components. However if you do not have the time or interest to build one yourself, you can buy a fully assembled Guabox from us. All you have to do is plug it in and start using it.</p>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 30px; border-bottom: 1px solid #2aa928;"">Camera Compatibility List</h2>
<p>Our competitors try to sell you multiple expensive devices to cover your entire house. You might have to pay in excess of $1000 for a smart, 4-camera system. We are different. Guacam is an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONVIF"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Onvif</a> compatible camera hub. You can buy one Guabox and 4 other cheap ($30 to $100) IP cameras, cover your entire house and still have enough money left to throw a house party.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448123883/dsmugm3e1bkpqszph6y1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Due to Guabox’s unique ability to be a camera hub, you can attach up to 15 external IP cameras to a single Guabox device (depending on model). Guabox supports hundreds of commercially available IP-based cameras with H.264, MPEG-4 or MJPEG video streams. Whether you have a consumer-grade (D-Link, Foscam, Trendnet, etc.) or more expensive and enterprise-rated camera (Axis, Pelco, Panasonic, etc.), Guacam works equally well with all of them. Our video ingestion and processing algorithms have been thoroughly tested and hardened. Guabox is capable of discovering cameras on your network and automatically configuring the system to receive streams from them. This magic is achieved through the Onvif standard which many cameras support. However we did not stop with IP cameras. We also support USB cameras (known as webcams), fog penetrating, night vision and thermal cameras as well as the Xbox Kinect for true night vision performance! If you happen to come across a camera we do not support, chances are we can add support in just few hours!</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Competing companies sell their home security cameras for $250 or more a piece. A four camera system will run you around $1000. Guacam system will cost you $150 for Guabox and $35 for a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/D-Link-DCS-930L-mydlink-Enabled-Wireless-N-Network/dp/B00452V66G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1432522108&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=d-link+dcs-930l"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">D-LINK DCS-930L</a> (as an example), totaling $255 for a four-camera system; 75% less than competitors! If you wanted to go real cheap and have an old computer, you can deploy Guacam monitoring app on it and only pay for four cameras saving even more.</p>

<h2 style=""margin-top: 30px; border-bottom: 1px solid #2aa928;"">Brief History</h2>
<p>What started as a simple video monitoring application to help my parents keep an eye on my aging grandmother, has evolved over the last four years into a robust and intelligent video monitoring appliance. Two years ago a small team was formed and expanded on the original idea. We started to experiment with processing video streams efficiently on low cost platforms (like the Raspberry Pi) as well as desktop and server-class devices. Over the past year our spare energy was funneled into this project, many tears were shed, unholy amounts of coffee were drunk, many swear words were uttered and then finally Guacam with Guabox was born.</p>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 30px; border-bottom: 1px solid #2aa928;"">The Team</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448123735/eeuydnuzbbt47xaqxywd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 30px; border-bottom: 1px solid #2aa928;"">Why Indiegogo?</h2>
<p>To get the best prices on components, be it sensors or molded enclosures, we need to order in bulk. Building Guaboxes one piece at a time would not be commercially viable. And thus we come seeking the mighty power of the crowd to help us with the last mile so that we can bring this project to completion. Your money goes towards this one and only goal: We want to build a product which helps you and makes your life better.</p>
<p>We are in this for the long haul. If we get funded we want to build a product and service that grows with functionality and adopts to needs of its users.</p>

Guabox is a camera hub. It can connect to other IP and USB cameras and process feeds from them, thus making them smart.
Guabox's intelligent processing engine analyzes video, audio and sensor feeds in real-time and generates alerts, which are pushed to you.
Guabox is built on opensource hardware and software. In fact, you can build one yourself if you like.
Guabox comes with its own cloud service called Guacam, which gives you instant access to your cameras and data from anywhere in the world.


Everyone is curious about Guabox including Kubo the Tomcat. Want to find out more? Keep on reading.

At its simplest, Guacam is a pair of high-tech eyes and ears enhanced with persistent memory, which you can access from anywhere. Guacam enables you to monitor and secure your house, office, hotel room, or any other location with ease. Guacam consists of a cloud-based platform, which processes, stores and displays events and Guabox, an open-source hardware camera hub with built-in video and audio analytics engine.


Guacam is a cloud- and hardware-based video security platform, which turns any ordinary USB and IP video camera into a smart video and audio appliance. Guacam uses Guabox, a custom built device, which in addition to having its own HD camera can connect to consumer- and professional-grade off-the-shelf cameras to give you more video coverage. That's right, you can use any USB and IP camera to extend your system with ease. Guacam's interface enables you, with just a few clicks, to see live feeds, browse archive video, setup intelligent detections, securely share video feeds with others, receive real-time alerts and much more!
Guacam Features

Our philosophy is different from all other competing products and services. Instead of building a single purpose device, we have decided to leverage the power of open-source hardware and build an appliance, which loves interoperability. We have concentrated our efforts on simplicity, robustness, cost and ability to work with as many existing systems and devices as possible. And thus we came up with the BYOC (Bring Your Own Camera) concept, where you can use any commercially available USB or IP camera with Guacam - indoor, outdoor, night-vision or thermal; it's your choice. Our platform is based on popular and easily available hardware and can be assembled by almost anyone. We have also built into the system a wide array of video- and audio-based detections, which leverage feeds from your cameras to bring you a real-time situational awareness of your house and surroundings.

What's Guacam All About?
Simplicity: Guacam consists of two parts: Guabox, a smart-home appliance and a cloud platform, which stores and processes events. That's it. Our installation wizard will guide you through a simple deployment process at your house or any other location you wish to monitor.
Robustness: Our algorithms are hardened and tested. We have been running them for over twelve months and many tweaks and adjustments have been made to minimize false alarms. The last thing we want is to release a buggy software.
Biggest bang for your buck: Guacam is affordable. We have built the monitoring app to work as a camera hub. No need to purchase security-system-specific cameras. Guabox comes with one built-in camera and beyond that you can BYOC: buy any off-the-shelf IP or USB camera, hook it up to Guacam and voila! You have a multi-camera monitoring system.
Security: Guacam is secure. The technology we are using to deliver live and archive video uses the only encrypted video delivery protocol currently available. And of course we use HTTPS for everything.
Flexibility: Guacam can be used at home, at the office, on-the-go, anyway you like. Because Guacam is powered by a versatile app, you can turn any computer into a security system. You can also connect indoor and outdoor cameras, including cameras with PTZ control. You make the rules!

How It Works
Guacam's monitoring app is a versatile piece of software, which runs on a computer inside your house. Whether it is your laptop, desktop or a specialized computer (like the Guabox), our app is easily deployed in any environment: Buy Guabox and put it on a shelf somewhere or download our app and install it on your home computer. That's it.
Once the application is installed, it tries to find all accessible cameras in its vicinity and starts pulling video feeds automatically. However you are in complete control since you can disable and delete any camera you don't want to use. You can also choose which cameras run detections on them and at what times of day.

The monitoring app, via Guacam's cloud-based interface, enables you to look at live and archive video, receive alarm notifications in real-time, define alarm schedules and interest zones, add as many cameras as the host computer can handle and much more!
Feature-packed browser interface.
Live and Archived Video
Humans are forgetful creatures of habit. Without consciously realizing we cycle through numerous routines each day. Did I turn the stove off? Did I forget to close the garage door? Do these sound familiar to you? The universe does not provide us with one huge DVR box we could use to easily recall events from the past, but where the universe fails, Guacam succeeds. Guacam archives all your cameras and you get access to live and archive video no matter where you are. As long as you have internet access you can see your cameras.
""Did I turn the stove off?"" Find out instantly.
""Did I close the garage door?"" Check from anywhere.
With just a few taps you can check up on your house or loved ones remotely.
Intelligent Detections
We are also very curious and inquisitive creatures. Who has has been eating all the ice cream late at night? Which neighbor is not cleaning up after their dog on my lawn? Who has been stealing my packages while I am at work? These questions are easily answered by Guacam. All you have to do is click a button to enable detections and decide if you want to be notified in real-time via email or through Guacam’s browser or mobile application.
Caught the ice cream thief!
Detection Types
Alarm on any motion in the view of your camera or define specific interest zones. Imagine you keep finding dog poop on your lawn and you want to be alerted every time someone steps on your lawn, but not when someone walks on the adjacent sidewalk. You can define an interest zone within your camera's view with just few clicks. One camera can have multiple interest zones.
Supports multiple detection zones.
Alarm on people loitering in the view of your camera. Get automatically notified when a person or group of people are standing around in a restricted area defined by you.
Work well outside and inside.
Alarm when object is added to or removed from the scene. Get notified when someone drops of or removes a box, suitcase or any other object you wish to monitor.
Alarm when certain sound level is reached within the earshot of one of your cameras. You can set the level on per camera basis. Our future development will include sound classifications where you will be able to exclude let's say barking.
Detect various types of sounds.
Alarm when light/brightness levels change. Get automatically notified when someone turns on/off lights in the view of your camera.
Alarm on motion direction. Get automatically notified when people walk into your house or room, but not when they walk out.
Alarm on temperature change. Set a temperature and a threshold and if someone messes with your thermostat, does not close a patio door or affects the indoor temperature in some other way, you will find out instantly.
Security On-The-Go
Guacam is very versatile. You can take it with you on the road and monitor your assets no matter where you are. Guacam's monitoring app runs on any Intel/ARM-based computer and it can pull video from USB/On-board cameras, thus you can turn your laptop or tablet into a compact on-the-go security appliance.

Install Guacam's monitoring app on your laptop and leave it running in your hotel room while you are out and about. Guacam will record everything in the view of your laptop's camera and send live alarms to your mobile device. Even if the worst case scenario happens and your belongings are stolen, including your laptop, you have record of everything that happened, stored securely in the cloud.

The monitoring possibilities are endless - hotel rooms, RVs, boats and camp grounds. You can deploy Guacam anywhere in the world by simply turning on your laptop and connecting it to an available WiFi or wired network. Guacam will do the rest automatically.


Guacam's monitoring app needs a dedicated piece of hardware, which it can call its home. Sure, you can run the app on your laptop or desktop computer, but we wanted an easy-to-use, small-footprint appliance as well. We thought long and hard about building custom hardware, but eventually decided against this idea. To minimize risk and shorten delivery time, we have set out to build Guabox on an exiting and widely available platform.
Guabox is based on the popular Raspberry Pi (version 2) ARM-based computer. Together with the HD wide-angle camera module and a handful of sensors, we were able to build a powerful, but affordable intelligent video monitoring appliance.
Raspberry Pi 2 and our new 8MPix camera module.
First version of Guabox running on Raspberry Pi 1r2.
Guabox camera housing design - nice round avocado shape.
3D printing an avocado. Duplicating nature is not easy.

Final design for Guabox - This is what we are shooting for
It all sounds simple: Take the Raspberry Pi (or Orange Pi or other comparable device), add to it full HD wide-angle camera, handful of useful sensors, our monitoring app and you have a powerful security appliance. Make it easy on the eyes by dressing it up in a nice looking enclosure and even The Guggenheim would not shy away from using it. To get here we had to solve many issues, optimize our code, pick the right camera module, create a small, yet feature-packed sensor board and fit all that into a slice of an avocado.

Guabox Specs and Features

Guabox Models
All Guabox models feature WiFi and USB ports, which can be used to extend video storage capabilities or plug in USB camera.
Guabox - this model features an on-board camera, 32GB of built-in storage and is capable of processing 4 additional IP or USB cameras. If you need to deploy more than 5 cameras (one built-in and four external), not a problem. Simply stack more Guaboxes together. Put one in your living room, one in your garage and process a total of 10 cameras.
Guabox Pro - a more powerful platform with Gigabit Ethernet, 1TB of built-in storage (expandable via USB), can handle up to 15 IP cameras for your maximum viewing pleasure. Guabox Pro is also stackable.
More Sensors
We are working on expanding the current capabilities of Guabox with additional set of sensors, which will be coupled together with the existing architecture. You can help us achieve this goal by funding this project. If we double our funding goal, we will build Guabox with passive IR, IR illuminators, humidity, vibration sensor and audio-out.
Feature Comparison

Guacam also features RESTful API interface. You can write your own extensions and scripts!
Open-Source Hardware Platform
We did not set out to create a proprietary, single-purpose device. Guabox is built on hardware anyone can easily get, put together and recycle for another purpose if desired. The secret sauce is in our cross-platform monitoring app, which we give out for free. We provide an easy-to-follow tutorial on how you can put a Guabox together yourself using recommended components. However if you do not have the time or interest to build one yourself, you can buy a fully assembled Guabox from us. All you have to do is plug it in and start using it.
Camera Compatibility List
Our competitors try to sell you multiple expensive devices to cover your entire house. You might have to pay in excess of $1000 for a smart, 4-camera system. We are different. Guacam is an Onvif compatible camera hub. You can buy one Guabox and 4 other cheap ($30 to $100) IP cameras, cover your entire house and still have enough money left to throw a house party.

Due to Guabox’s unique ability to be a camera hub, you can attach up to 15 external IP cameras to a single Guabox device (depending on model). Guabox supports hundreds of commercially available IP-based cameras with H.264, MPEG-4 or MJPEG video streams. Whether you have a consumer-grade (D-Link, Foscam, Trendnet, etc.) or more expensive and enterprise-rated camera (Axis, Pelco, Panasonic, etc.), Guacam works equally well with all of them. Our video ingestion and processing algorithms have been thoroughly tested and hardened. Guabox is capable of discovering cameras on your network and automatically configuring the system to receive streams from them. This magic is achieved through the Onvif standard which many cameras support. However we did not stop with IP cameras. We also support USB cameras (known as webcams), fog penetrating, night vision and thermal cameras as well as the Xbox Kinect for true night vision performance! If you happen to come across a camera we do not support, chances are we can add support in just few hours!
Examples
Competing companies sell their home security cameras for $250 or more a piece. A four camera system will run you around $1000. Guacam system will cost you $150 for Guabox and $35 for a D-LINK DCS-930L (as an example), totaling $255 for a four-camera system; 75% less than competitors! If you wanted to go real cheap and have an old computer, you can deploy Guacam monitoring app on it and only pay for four cameras saving even more.

Timeline

Brief History
What started as a simple video monitoring application to help my parents keep an eye on my aging grandmother, has evolved over the last four years into a robust and intelligent video monitoring appliance. Two years ago a small team was formed and expanded on the original idea. We started to experiment with processing video streams efficiently on low cost platforms (like the Raspberry Pi) as well as desktop and server-class devices. Over the past year our spare energy was funneled into this project, many tears were shed, unholy amounts of coffee were drunk, many swear words were uttered and then finally Guacam with Guabox was born.
The Team

Why Indiegogo?
To get the best prices on components, be it sensors or molded enclosures, we need to order in bulk. Building Guaboxes one piece at a time would not be commercially viable. And thus we come seeking the mighty power of the crowd to help us with the last mile so that we can bring this project to completion. Your money goes towards this one and only goal: We want to build a product which helps you and makes your life better.
We are in this for the long haul. If we get funded we want to build a product and service that grows with functionality and adopts to needs of its users.
Thank You
Building things that work is hard. We don't have VCs or other investors backing us, everything we have achieved so far is through bootstrapping, sacrifices and lot of work. We would not have made it this far without support from family and friends. We would like to thank everyone who supported us and will support us in future; a special ""Thank you"" goes to talented teams at Mother Volcano and WKY in Portugal.",39.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>As Registered Nurses (RNs), co-founders Lloyd and Jade looked high and low for a mobile app that would fit the needs of their nursing staff… a comprehensive tool that would improve critical thinking in clinical settings and also reduce work stress to help solve the nursing shortage. They couldn’t find a tool that fit their needs so they decided to build it themselves!<br/> </p>
<p>Intuitive RN is designed to enhance clinical practice, and even help solve the nursing shortage, in three ways:<br/>• <u><strong>Work Smarter, Not Harder</strong></u> - amplify clinical skills and improve the ability to complete tasks<br/>• <u><strong>Reduce Nurse Burnout </strong></u>– enhanced job satisfaction through critical thinking assistance, time management help, and improved nurse report processes<br/>• <u><strong>Improve Patient Outcomes</strong></u> - quick access to critical information will enable nurses to make advanced clinical decisions that improve patient outcomes</p>
<p><br/>At Intuitive RN, our passion is to guide every nurse as they progressed from student, to novice, to expert nurse. The beta version of Intuitive RN includes 10 primary diagnoses which have been tested by over 1,000 users. The initial feedback has been positive but we learned we needed to expanded our content and develop some additional functionality before we could monetize the app and make it an effective tool for all nurses. As a result of our efforts, we discovered we need your help to accomplish this task. By empowering nurses across the US, and eventually worldwide, we believe we can improve healthcare systems, improve patient outcomes, and help solve the nursing shortage.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>Our unique design was developed by nurses, for nurses, to enhance clinical practice at the bedside:</p>

<h3>Our Funding Goal*</h3>
<p>We need a minimum of $30,000 to add additional functionality, and develop more diagnoses, to meet end-user needs. These funds will be allocated to app development, but if excess funds exist, we will begin developing a marketing campaign and continue our efforts to gain HIPAA compliance. *NOTE: HIPAA compliance is not required, since the app does not allow the end-user to input patient personal information. However, HIPAA compliance will improve confidence in the app and allow for the addition of future functionality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Opportunity for Greatness!</h3>
<p>The beta version of the app is FREE to download, for a limited time, on the App Store and Google Play.  We did this to receive ample feedback so that we can learn how to improve it. This feedback gave us confidence that we are on the right track, but our ability to take this app to the next level is financially challenging. By funding this campaign, you will assist us to add user-identified functionality that will improve nursing care and patient outcomes. Intuitive RN is a ground-breaking clinical support app, released only in the USA at this point, but it has global implications. We will need large amounts of capital in order to bring Intuitive RN to nurses around the world. Join us and help support nurses! </p>

As Registered Nurses (RNs), co-founders Lloyd and Jade looked high and low for a mobile app that would fit the needs of their nursing staff… a comprehensive tool that would improve critical thinking in clinical settings and also reduce work stress to help solve the nursing shortage. They couldn’t find a tool that fit their needs so they decided to build it themselves! 
Intuitive RN is designed to enhance clinical practice, and even help solve the nursing shortage, in three ways:• Work Smarter, Not Harder - amplify clinical skills and improve the ability to complete tasks• Reduce Nurse Burnout – enhanced job satisfaction through critical thinking assistance, time management help, and improved nurse report processes• Improve Patient Outcomes - quick access to critical information will enable nurses to make advanced clinical decisions that improve patient outcomes
At Intuitive RN, our passion is to guide every nurse as they progressed from student, to novice, to expert nurse. The beta version of Intuitive RN includes 10 primary diagnoses which have been tested by over 1,000 users. The initial feedback has been positive but we learned we needed to expanded our content and develop some additional functionality before we could monetize the app and make it an effective tool for all nurses. As a result of our efforts, we discovered we need your help to accomplish this task. By empowering nurses across the US, and eventually worldwide, we believe we can improve healthcare systems, improve patient outcomes, and help solve the nursing shortage.

</div></div>","About Cloud PlannerSet goals of your life, stick to them and you will reach it. The starting of Cloud Planner is when we think about our working life, working for the whole night, don’t have enough time for our family, friends, exercise, and hobby. We also have lots of things to finish every day. Our day had low productive and made us disappoint. We wanted to find the tool to help us balance our life. That tools out there couldn’t do it. One thing that waste our time is copy things by handwriting. We really want to capture ideas from whiteboard to a planner book by just take a photo. It would help us save time pretty much.All we need is setting goals, tracking project’s progress, organize daily tasks, to-do list. Then we decided to create Cloud Planner. The beginning of Cloud PlannerWe often jotted down the plan, diaries, meeting appointments not only work, seminar or even weekend trip planning to our planner. However, we could not attach the digital files which having pictures from our trips, voice clips from meeting or even pictures from what we have seen or people we met, interesting voices which we heard to my personal planner book. Those are our problems.AND… THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROJECT.What if we could turn our paper plans to be able to save our memories or other’s memories, the pictures, the mesmerized voice, fabulous ideas that we could come up, minutes of meeting, or important files into my planner book.So, what will be happened, if we could place Digital Files such as Photo, Presentation, Document, and Voice Clip into a planner book?
 What is Cloud Planner?
Cloud Planner is the smart planner book, the assistance to help you balance your life, comes with mobile application that can attach and link your digital files from your smart phone into a smart paper planner.Cloud Planner was designed to clarify your life in different ways, work, social, health, mind and family. Don’t forget your life is not just only work or schoolwork.
So your goals do not have only career goals but it also creates daily life balance. 
Make your life easier by using Cloud Planner because of ‘QR Code’, you could keep your digital files with paper planner together. QR code management would assist you on how to organize your files. You just scan your QR code through Cloud Planner App and yes, it is FREE on both IOS and Android version. Everything would be done.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Catalog Database System is a multifunctional NoSQL based database. We, the developers invented it to make the developement more easier when a database is cruisal. Our aim is to make this system more user and developer friendly with as much funtions as possible using only just a few keywords, commands and methods.</p>
<p>We would like to make a flexible system which can be used across a variety types of languages, sytaxes, operating system platforms.</p>
<p>In total, we would like to create a multifunctional, easy to use, user-friendly database engine, system and environment that can be used everywhere in no time.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To achieve all the aims you had read we need your contributions. We would like to work on this system on full time. But without financial support it is almost impossible.</p>
<p>So, hereby we ask you the Reader to contribute our work helping us to finish this project to make a free and powerful database system, The Catalog.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Here are some features you can try out in this prototype:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Small environment size.</strong> In early stages of production and also during the whole development process the need of a lightweight database is a must. One of many important aims of The Catalog is small environment and database size.</li>
<li>
<strong>Low system resource requirements.</strong> Small environment and database size. These help us - and as well you, the user - to achieve small system resource requirements. That makes The Catalog really powerful compared to traditional SQL Systems.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fast deployment.</strong> No installation procedure, no dependencies. The Catalog is a compact distribution. Set up your database server in a few minutes, in less than 10 clicks.</li>
<li>
<strong>Easy usage.</strong> Learn the usage in less than 20 minutes. No types, no attributes, no functions. Only 10 keywords are needed for basic usage!</li>
<li>
<strong>Seperated Systems.</strong> Because of it's low resource requirements and portability The Catalog can be run on seperated systems. We used and evolved the traditional master-slave database architecture and created realtime and offline mirroring.</li>
<li>
<strong>High redundancy.</strong> Because of the embeded mirroring system and mobility with The Catalog you can achieve an infinite level redundancy. Imagine possibilities of installing The Catalog on mobile devices, such as flash drives or Raspberry Pi, and these connection in net. With this architecture data loss is impossible, because databases recover themselves from neighbourhood on runtime.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>My name is Jacques and I have a long background in mathematics and programming.</p>
<p>One of my hobbies included working on the forex market selling and buying currencies using multiple strategies.</p>
<p>I have struggled to find a forex strategy that consistently made profit, except for one called Triangular arbitrage.</p>
<p>So I started testing the strategy and combined it with others to ultimately come up with a program that makes upwards of 1000% profit a year with a 20% drawdown.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I do not have the funds to finish the application beyond the demo testing phase seeing that on a live account the application must be bomb proof and be ready for non forex related problems like Internet, pc, network failures and more.</p>
<p>During demo runs there is none of those problems, but during live runs the program must be able to cater for these and more problems, but it will take about 2 months worth of development to complete.</p>
<p>I will be using the funds received here to finish the development and fund the initial live test with $10000.</p>
<p>Once the application is stable I will release the application along with a detailed and simple document where the only request will be to please share some of the profit the application generate with someone in dire financial need.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $10,000 for the actual trade account to test run on a live forex account, which I chose myfxchoice for.</p>
<p>$5000 extra will be used to hire virtual server online, on which my application will run.</p>
<p>This virtual server is needed to get a good connection to the forex market without delays and to ensure the pc the application is running on is stable and does not cause extra problems.</p>
<p>I need to fund development for the final part of the application for the next 2 months which comes to another $25,000 to pay for the pc hardware and software programs I use to develop the application.</p>
<p>The application is already running in a demo environment where it does not have to worry about Internet, pc hardware or metatrader software problems, unlike a live environment where those problems must be catered for.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p>I will give weekly or more updates during the 2 month development of the application and the 3 months of live trading using the application thereafter.</p>
<p>Once the goal is released and the application is completed then I will release the application and also a document explaining how to use it on any forex metatrader 4 and 5 broker, along with detailed information about how the application works in the back ground.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p>If I do not reach my entire goal I will still continue to work on the application, even though it will be delayed while my focus changes to other development so I can fund the application myself.</p>
<p>I have already seen the potential of this application and if you look at the images on this page you can see for yourself how profitable this application is.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p>This indiegogo compain is just to help me realize my dream of creating something that could bing financially struggling people out of poverty without them having to go through years of traning, which they can not afford to begin with.</p>
<p>I will be updating this indiegogo page on a regular basis with as much information as possible on the progress.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>People are struggling financially world wide.</p>
<p>I myself are going through a rough period and I know a lot of people far worse off than me.</p>
<p>One thing people are told if you are in a financial hole is to buck up and work hard to get out of it.</p>
<p>That is fine, but most of the time you need certain skills to get yourself out of it, which costs money, which you do not have, which causes a vicious circle, out of which there seem to be no escape.</p>
<p>Using this program people can start supporting themselves with very little funds and make a living using it.</p>
<p>Those that do use the program can then help others to build a sustainable income until those can do the same.</p>
<p>Everyone is told to invest in something, but what ?</p>
<p>This application is transparent in how it works and it works very good.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The application need to be made aware of all potential problems once it goes live.</p>
<p>Things like pc and Internet problems causing the application to stop and start.</p>
<p>The application need to be developed to be ready for these and more live problems and to recover from them correctly with no loss in capital.</p>
<p>Trading live on the forex maket in itself is very risky.</p>
<p>You need to monitor it 24/7 every day of the year.</p>
<p>This application will be able to do this , thereby removing most of the risk in the forex market.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Strategy. All rules and transparency</h3>
<p>The program will be completely automated and you just have to install it and run it and it will do the rest.</p>
<p>The following is just more detail about the background working of the program and not needed to run the program.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The forex market goes up and down all the time.</p>
<p>The trick is to buy when it is low and sell when it is high and so make a profit.</p>
<p>Problem is the Forex market can always go lower and who says that what you think is the lowest point wont go lower and therefore you lose everything.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This program runs on a Triangular Arbitrage between the following currency pairs :</p>
<p>GBPUSD</p>
<p>USDJPY</p>
<p>GBPJPY</p>
<p>As you can see it runs in a circle or triangle and therefore do not suffer from the inpredictabillity of normal forex trades.</p>
<p>Start with 100GBP and get USD, then use the USD to get JPY, then use the JPY to get back your 100GBP.</p>
<p>Therefore ZERO profit and loss, except for minor brokerage fees.</p>
<p>BUT the forex market is never perfect.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will get back 99GBP and sometimes 101GBP. (Only examples)</p>
<p>The point is that it will always be a little below and above this ""ZERO"" 100GBP point.</p>
<p>Therefore unlike the normal forex market you are guaranteed that the low in this price range will be the low and the same for the high points, unless one of these countries disappears from existence. Not likely and even then we will have bigger problems.</p>
<p>Just one problem.</p>
<p>The program will buy somewhere and hold the currencies until the price goes up.</p>
<p>Who says the program did not accidentally buy at the highest point, meaning the price will never pass it and therefore it will be stuck.</p>
<p>No real loss, because it can not fall far from that point and the ZERO point, but we are here for profit.</p>
<p>If the program determines the market is stuck then it will implement a grid system.</p>
<p>Basically over time it monitors all the low points and if stuck it will buy at another low point and therefore it will be guaranteed to at least go back close to the previous high stuck point, which only half way is needed for profit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now there is a lot more safety catches and rules to the program and during tests between 2015/06/23 until 2017/06/15 with a $1000 account it ended up with $700,000 and the lowest the account dropped (drawdown) during this time was 19% of the account value at that time.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>You can even build your own program using these transparent rules, but please help me get funding to complete this application and make it safe for live trading and finally some funds to start live trading.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please go out and tell people about this project.</p>
<p>The more people interested in this the faster the goal can be reached and the faster the application can be completed and released.</p>
<p>Please look at the indiegogo share tools for help in spreading the word.</p>
<p>And please ask questions. I will try and answer to the best of my abilities.</p>
<p>At the moment the first version of the program is working very good, but very technical in that to use it you have to set it up in code, which is impractical for most people.</p>
<p>When the program gets to a more user friendly stage I will release the demo version of the program which you can test for yourself in stead of just going on what I say.</p>
<h3>Boring Technical System Workings</h3>
<p>I already made an DEMO EA to trade GBPUSB, GBPJPY and USDJPY</p>
<p>Basically <br/>1) Buy 1 unit GBPJPY<br/>2) Sell 1 unit GBPUSD<br/>3) Sell ?? units using the USD in USDJPY to balance everything out</p>
<p>This basically ZEROs your position minus spread, commission and swap.<br/>Just hold on to this until in profit.<br/>It will oscillate around the ZERO point.</p>
<p>Once I make profit I swap the above 123 points to Sell, Buy, Buy.</p>
<p>My entry is random and then go from there.</p>
<p>Now sometimes you do accidentally get in at just the wrong time.<br/>Basically buying at the highest point and it never gets back to that point.</p>
<p>In 2 years time I found it about 4 times.</p>
<p>This problem is solved by a minor grid.<br/>Basically once you unluckily buy at the highest point then you will be stuck, but no worries, because it can only fall so far before coming back, but never past that point again so just wait a bit and let it fall and once it fell enough then Buy again the same amount and leave it for a guaranteed profit a bit more than half way back so just wait a bit.</p>
<p>The demo EA I wrote I ran from 2015-06-23 till 2017-06-16.<br/>I started with $1000 and ended with $2,725,839.38<br/>Maximum drawdown during this time was 25% of the account.</p>
<p>I did have a safety catch in the system to prevent losses from going beyond 25% which was hit 2 times during the 2 year run, which does not affect the EA seeing that it will adapt itself to the next balance as needed.<br/>The cause for the 25% drawdown spikes was weekend gaps on the Monday.<br/>I tried preventing Friday trades which caused the maximum drawdown to drop to 15%, but the ending profit also dropped to about $1,800,000.00</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hi there.
My name is Jacques and I have a long background in mathematics and programming.
One of my hobbies included working on the forex market selling and buying currencies using multiple strategies.
I have struggled to find a forex strategy that consistently made profit, except for one called Triangular arbitrage.
So I started testing the strategy and combined it with others to ultimately come up with a program that makes upwards of 1000% profit a year with a 20% drawdown.
Unfortunately I do not have the funds to finish the application beyond the demo testing phase seeing that on a live account the application must be bomb proof and be ready for non forex related problems like Internet, pc, network failures and more.
During demo runs there is none of those problems, but during live runs the program must be able to cater for these and more problems, but it will take about 2 months worth of development to complete.
I will be using the funds received here to finish the development and fund the initial live test with $10000.
Once the application is stable I will release the application along with a detailed and simple document where the only request will be to please share some of the profit the application generate with someone in dire financial need.
 

What We Need & What You Get
I need $10,000 for the actual trade account to test run on a live forex account, which I chose myfxchoice for.
$5000 extra will be used to hire virtual server online, on which my application will run.
This virtual server is needed to get a good connection to the forex market without delays and to ensure the pc the application is running on is stable and does not cause extra problems.
I need to fund development for the final part of the application for the next 2 months which comes to another $25,000 to pay for the pc hardware and software programs I use to develop the application.
The application is already running in a demo environment where it does not have to worry about Internet, pc hardware or metatrader software problems, unlike a live environment where those problems must be catered for.
 
I will give weekly or more updates during the 2 month development of the application and the 3 months of live trading using the application thereafter.
Once the goal is released and the application is completed then I will release the application and also a document explaining how to use it on any forex metatrader 4 and 5 broker, along with detailed information about how the application works in the back ground.
 
If I do not reach my entire goal I will still continue to work on the application, even though it will be delayed while my focus changes to other development so I can fund the application myself.
I have already seen the potential of this application and if you look at the images on this page you can see for yourself how profitable this application is.
 
This indiegogo compain is just to help me realize my dream of creating something that could bing financially struggling people out of poverty without them having to go through years of traning, which they can not afford to begin with.
I will be updating this indiegogo page on a regular basis with as much information as possible on the progress.

The Impact
People are struggling financially world wide.
I myself are going through a rough period and I know a lot of people far worse off than me.
One thing people are told if you are in a financial hole is to buck up and work hard to get out of it.
That is fine, but most of the time you need certain skills to get yourself out of it, which costs money, which you do not have, which causes a vicious circle, out of which there seem to be no escape.
Using this program people can start supporting themselves with very little funds and make a living using it.
Those that do use the program can then help others to build a sustainable income until those can do the same.
Everyone is told to invest in something, but what ?
This application is transparent in how it works and it works very good.

Risks & Challenges
The application need to be made aware of all potential problems once it goes live.
Things like pc and Internet problems causing the application to stop and start.
The application need to be developed to be ready for these and more live problems and to recover from them correctly with no loss in capital.
Trading live on the forex maket in itself is very risky.
You need to monitor it 24/7 every day of the year.
This application will be able to do this , thereby removing most of the risk in the forex market.

The Strategy. All rules and transparency
The program will be completely automated and you just have to install it and run it and it will do the rest.
The following is just more detail about the background working of the program and not needed to run the program.
 
The forex market goes up and down all the time.
The trick is to buy when it is low and sell when it is high and so make a profit.
Problem is the Forex market can always go lower and who says that what you think is the lowest point wont go lower and therefore you lose everything.
 
This program runs on a Triangular Arbitrage between the following currency pairs :
GBPUSD
USDJPY
GBPJPY
As you can see it runs in a circle or triangle and therefore do not suffer from the inpredictabillity of normal forex trades.
Start with 100GBP and get USD, then use the USD to get JPY, then use the JPY to get back your 100GBP.
Therefore ZERO profit and loss, except for minor brokerage fees.
BUT the forex market is never perfect.
Sometimes you will get back 99GBP and sometimes 101GBP. (Only examples)
The point is that it will always be a little below and above this ""ZERO"" 100GBP point.
Therefore unlike the normal forex market you are guaranteed that the low in this price range will be the low and the same for the high points, unless one of these countries disappears from existence. Not likely and even then we will have bigger problems.
Just one problem.
The program will buy somewhere and hold the currencies until the price goes up.
Who says the program did not accidentally buy at the highest point, meaning the price will never pass it and therefore it will be stuck.
No real loss, because it can not fall far from that point and the ZERO point, but we are here for profit.
If the program determines the market is stuck then it will implement a grid system.
Basically over time it monitors all the low points and if stuck it will buy at another low point and therefore it will be guaranteed to at least go back close to the previous high stuck point, which only half way is needed for profit.
 
Now there is a lot more safety catches and rules to the program and during tests between 2015/06/23 until 2017/06/15 with a $1000 account it ended up with $700,000 and the lowest the account dropped (drawdown) during this time was 19% of the account value at that time.
There you go.
You can even build your own program using these transparent rules, but please help me get funding to complete this application and make it safe for live trading and finally some funds to start live trading.
Other Ways You Can Help
Please go out and tell people about this project.
The more people interested in this the faster the goal can be reached and the faster the application can be completed and released.
Please look at the indiegogo share tools for help in spreading the word.
And please ask questions. I will try and answer to the best of my abilities.
At the moment the first version of the program is working very good, but very technical in that to use it you have to set it up in code, which is impractical for most people.
When the program gets to a more user friendly stage I will release the demo version of the program which you can test for yourself in stead of just going on what I say.
Boring Technical System Workings
I already made an DEMO EA to trade GBPUSB, GBPJPY and USDJPY
Basically 1) Buy 1 unit GBPJPY2) Sell 1 unit GBPUSD3) Sell ?? units using the USD in USDJPY to balance everything out
This basically ZEROs your position minus spread, commission and swap.Just hold on to this until in profit.It will oscillate around the ZERO point.
Once I make profit I swap the above 123 points to Sell, Buy, Buy.
My entry is random and then go from there.
Now sometimes you do accidentally get in at just the wrong time.Basically buying at the highest point and it never gets back to that point.
In 2 years time I found it about 4 times.
This problem is solved by a minor grid.Basically once you unluckily buy at the highest point then you will be stuck, but no worries, because it can only fall so far before coming back, but never past that point again so just wait a bit and let it fall and once it fell enough then Buy again the same amount and leave it for a guaranteed profit a bit more than half way back so just wait a bit.
The demo EA I wrote I ran from 2015-06-23 till 2017-06-16.I started with $1000 and ended with $2,725,839.38Maximum drawdown during this time was 25% of the account.
I did have a safety catch in the system to prevent losses from going beyond 25% which was hit 2 times during the 2 year run, which does not affect the EA seeing that it will adapt itself to the next balance as needed.The cause for the 25% drawdown spikes was weekend gaps on the Monday.I tried preventing Friday trades which caused the maximum drawdown to drop to 15%, but the ending profit also dropped to about $1,800,000.00
Other things to note was that I was maxing out my Metatrader 5 back test lot size at 99 lots after the 1 year mark at about 2016-06-28 and from there it stopped growing exponentially and started a slower sequential growth.In the live environment you can split your account into multiple accounts long before it reaches the limit for even more profit.
I do not have funds to test this live, but demo testing seem quite good.
I even found this to be profitable using a starting capitol of only $100, but at this price all 3 pairs will start at the same 0.01 lots, which is a bit off in balance seeing that the USDJPY can not be the same as the other, but once it breaks the $1000 profit mark it works good and the $10,000 mark is just rocket fuel for it.
Ignore the upward spikes in the charts.The EA is told to start selling the highest profitable once first.What matters to me is the equity and how far it falls after opening a 3 pair group.
The 2 pair 25% drawdown happened in the beginning of the chart and therefore is almost invisible when compared to the profit of the rest of the chart.

Are you struggling with out-of-home salon services that would cost up to $4000 for a single treatment?Experience this advanced technology in your own home, available to use at any time without breaking the bank!              JOVS Venus Pro instant hair removal device is specially designed for professional home beauty use, effectively removes unwanted hairs. It using laser technology (Intense Pulsed Light) that emits rapid light pulses. The pulse works under the skin's surface to target hairs at the root to inhibit their growth. It's gentle enough for everyday use and it won't cause irritation at all! It can be used on all body parts including the underarms, legs, thighs, bikini line, face, neck, shoulders, back etc.Starting at just $259 for the base model, and $349 for the high end model, you can save thousands while attaining similar results. Premium hair removal at your disposal, when and where you want, without disrupting your schedule. No costly cartridges, JOVS Venus Pro is a one time purchase and takes only 10 minutes to remove all bodily hair.  JOVS Venus Pro is the first hair removal device to achieve a Red Dot Design Award from Germany with its outstanding design.The stunning emerald color, combined with its beautiful organic design and comfortable matt metal texture, makes JOVS a pleasure to hold.  Further still, the carefully crafted 180-degree step-less control was incorporated with ergonomics in mind, allowing customers to use it in a super easy and comfortable way. This combination of function with aesthetics makes using JOVS Venus Pro a fantastic experience.   The combination of an ultra-high output density and precise laser wavelength control means you can effectively target pigment in the hair follicle to permanently disable the ability to regrow. Exemplary results every time. Most hair removal devices utilize wave filters rated at 470, 510 and 530. These filters aren’t entirely effective at preventing skin damage, resulting in some short wave energy affecting the skin, and leaving a tingling sensation which can be quite unpleasant. The JOVS Venus Pro uses a 590 red light filter which means that you can successfully remove hair without any side effects on the skin. The majority of hair removal devices available on the market only have a single head type with a flat rate of output from the diode. This means you won’t be able to effectively remove hair from all parts of your body. What is worse, this can lead to burns where the output is too high for certain applications.JOVS has undergone extensive testing across thousands of skin types and developed 6 unique modes to match your needs effectively without damaging your skin. Allowing you to be fully confident that the Venus Pro will effectively and safely remove all types of body hair.JOVS also enables you to remove your hair permanently. Combining the ultra-high output density and precise laser wavelength control, you can effectively target pigment in the hair follicle to permanently prevent regrowth.The amazing effect of JOVS will show up every time you use it! Different parts of the body contain different types and lengths of hair. JOVS has developed 6 interchangeable attachments designed to target specific hair types individually without pain, which may result from invalid light exposure in other hair-removing products. Not only can JOVS offers professional care based on the types of hair, but it also matches the contours of the human body, making it easier and more comfortable for customers to use. JOVS Venus Pro includes an accurate and fully adjustable energy output controller allowing you to tailor the output level to match your application area. Even those with the most sensitive skin will fall in love with the Venus Pro, creating a new standard of at-home professional hair removal. Dynamic cooling devices (DCD) is an innovative technique which creates a cooling sensation as light is emitted onto the skin. This creates a   protective layer with a maintained surface temperature of 5°C. This ensures that the removal process is completely painless and allows you to use the Venus Pro in sensitive areas. 
Each treatment takes only 10 minutes to complete. Typically, users can remove up to 94% of hair permanently in just 6 weeks. With only 0.8 seconds of continuous light exposure and interval times, JOVS allows for a shorter buffer time and thus quicker and more effective hair removal. Tests showed that the upper quartile of treatments exhibit 94.3% fewer hairs after 3

treatments, although this may vary across individuals. JOVS does not merely function as hair removal, but also serves to offer skincare.
Once hair removal is complete, you can adjust to the SR mode that can activate a red light skin rejuvenation instrument, ultimately contributing to the increased formation of collagen in the exposed skin. Lightening spots, rejuvenating wrinkles and shrinking pores without causing damage to skin tissue etc, JOVS will benefit you profoundly and endlessly.  With 500,000 flashes, provide full-body treatments for a long lifetime. Moreover, the JOVS Venus Pro is available for personal use for 15 years! No need to worry about replacing the cartridges.

<h3>If you don't have time to read the texts below, just look at this picture above~~~</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1. Breadboard circuits</strong></p>
<p>MEGO is designed to be compatible with a standard breadboard, so you can power up the breadboard rails directly by plugging MEGO on your board instead of cutting wires and clip with wire connectors.</p>
<p>The breadboard fitting feature is extremely helpful when you would like to demo your proof-of-concept circuit in front of your friends, your teachers or your video channels by presenting them a neat and clean breadboard circuit setup. </p>
<p><strong>2. Power up your development board</strong></p>
<p>Many development boards are powered with USB 5V, so your laptop USB port can handle it. What if you got an evaluation board which embedded some motors, sensors or amplifiers and it requires 9V or 12V to operate?</p>
<p>If you have a MEGO, you can power it up using the specialized output USB port, which allows you easily access the output voltage from 4V to 24V. For all MEGO sets, we included a USB-to-Jack connector (5.5/2.1mm) and a USB-to-Alligator clip wire to handle all types of connections.</p>
<p><strong>3. Conduct a quick test</strong></p>
<p>If you want test the RPM and torque of a DC motor with nominal voltage of 6V, or check the functionality of a breakout board with supply rail voltage of 5V, or verify the breakdown voltage of a zenor diode, or simply want to blow a 10V capacitor.......</p>
<p>Just turn on your MEGO, set to whatever voltage you need, connect the output USB port with the USB-to-Alligator clip, then, Red to positive rail, Black to negative rail...as simple as it sounds. By the way, you can do this anywhere you like, no power plugs needed~</p>
<p><strong>4. Negative voltage rail</strong></p>
<p>Some elements such as Operational Amplifiers (Opamps) may require a dual rail supply, which means you need a Positive, a Ground and also a Negative voltage. Creating a negative voltage can be accomplished using two MEGOs (the second Perk) where you can connect two MEGOs in series mode, which will be fully explained in the tutorial included in the package. In this way, you can generate up to PLUS and MINUS 24V, which satisfies the supply voltage requirements of most Opamps. </p>
<p><strong>5. Higher output current</strong></p>
<p>Connect multiple MEGOs in parallel mode allows a higher supply current capability. So in case your circuit is a current thirsty monster, try to feed it use multiple MEGOs. The second perk has two MEGOs, so it can generate up to 12 Watts of electrical power. </p>
<p><strong>6. Measure DC voltage</strong></p>
<p>MEGO is also capable to measure a DC voltage within 3V-30V. To do that, turn off your MEGO, connect USB output port with the USB-to-Alligator clips, and use the clip to probe the voltage you want to measure. (Do not probe a source if it may generate higher than 30V).</p>
<p><strong>7. Charging your smartphone</strong></p>
<p>In case your phone is low battery, and you don't have a power bank or adapter or laptop, you can use MEGO to charge your phone. When doing this, FIRST set the output voltage to 5V or below, and connect to the output USB port. The default charging current is 500mA. </p>

<p>The idea of MEGO was conceived by our dream chasers who yearned to make a difference on how our younger generations are motivated and enlightened with engineering and science today.</p>
<p>Back to those days at our beautiful school, Simon Fraser University, where we enjoyed the struggling of debugging circuits in the labs for days and nights, we were motivated to come up with an invention that can truly help us with our labs and projects. For the same goal,we reunited after graduation and collaborate on what became our first pre-commercial project, MEGO. </p>
<p>Before the team-up, each of the members have received adequate electronics knowledge at university and have gone through practical training during industry internships/researches. During years of graduate studies in the engineering and industrial practices, we developed outstanding skills in advanced electronics design, scientific research and product development. While many of our research works were published at well-known technology associations such IEEE, SPIE and etc, and also have been acknowledged as patent registered at USPTO and CPO that are ready for commercialization. In addition, we have supervised multiple undergraduate Capstone projects (eight month long, engineering challenging projects completed by teams of five senior students) which led to success and fulfillment in their undergraduate career.</p>
<p>MEGO’s full-stack development process, including hardware design, manufacturing, supply-chain management, final integration and testing, are completed upon the teamworks of all members. The non-technical components of the project such as video shooting and editing were outsourced to our collaboration team graduated from SFU IAT.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Having supported by our backers, we will have more resources and funding to put in MEGO production, and invest more to develop further projects. MEGO, once born, is greatly loved by many high school students and freshmen who are curious about technology. With all sorts of unique advantages of MEGO, it is definitely a great companion and starter-kick for students to get touch with electronics.</p>

</div><div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>To ensure the success of production, we’ve made multiple revisions of the 3D printed prototypes for MEGO, and worked closely with our partner manufacturers and parts suppliers. We also spent a lot of efforts to calculate the shipping rates from various couriers and post office to determine the most economic and efficient deal on your shipping.</p>
<p>However, our experience with crowdfunding is very limited, and we can predict that unexpected issues may happen. For example, shipping may get delayed due to some unexpected events such as strike, severe weather, holidays etc. For situations like this, we may have some buffer on our schedule. But we will ensure that we deliver your product and always keep you updated.</p>

With 4V - 24V output DC voltage, accurate voltage display and 6W of maximum output power, you can play with many sorts of electronics project. 

If you don't have time to read the texts below, just look at this picture above~~~
 
1. Breadboard circuits
MEGO is designed to be compatible with a standard breadboard, so you can power up the breadboard rails directly by plugging MEGO on your board instead of cutting wires and clip with wire connectors.
The breadboard fitting feature is extremely helpful when you would like to demo your proof-of-concept circuit in front of your friends, your teachers or your video channels by presenting them a neat and clean breadboard circuit setup. 
2. Power up your development board
Many development boards are powered with USB 5V, so your laptop USB port can handle it. What if you got an evaluation board which embedded some motors, sensors or amplifiers and it requires 9V or 12V to operate?
If you have a MEGO, you can power it up using the specialized output USB port, which allows you easily access the output voltage from 4V to 24V. For all MEGO sets, we included a USB-to-Jack connector (5.5/2.1mm) and a USB-to-Alligator clip wire to handle all types of connections.
3. Conduct a quick test
If you want test the RPM and torque of a DC motor with nominal voltage of 6V, or check the functionality of a breakout board with supply rail voltage of 5V, or verify the breakdown voltage of a zenor diode, or simply want to blow a 10V capacitor.......
Just turn on your MEGO, set to whatever voltage you need, connect the output USB port with the USB-to-Alligator clip, then, Red to positive rail, Black to negative rail...as simple as it sounds. By the way, you can do this anywhere you like, no power plugs needed~
4. Negative voltage rail
Some elements such as Operational Amplifiers (Opamps) may require a dual rail supply, which means you need a Positive, a Ground and also a Negative voltage. Creating a negative voltage can be accomplished using two MEGOs (the second Perk) where you can connect two MEGOs in series mode, which will be fully explained in the tutorial included in the package. In this way, you can generate up to PLUS and MINUS 24V, which satisfies the supply voltage requirements of most Opamps. 
5. Higher output current
Connect multiple MEGOs in parallel mode allows a higher supply current capability. So in case your circuit is a current thirsty monster, try to feed it use multiple MEGOs. The second perk has two MEGOs, so it can generate up to 12 Watts of electrical power. 
6. Measure DC voltage
MEGO is also capable to measure a DC voltage within 3V-30V. To do that, turn off your MEGO, connect USB output port with the USB-to-Alligator clips, and use the clip to probe the voltage you want to measure. (Do not probe a source if it may generate higher than 30V).
7. Charging your smartphone
In case your phone is low battery, and you don't have a power bank or adapter or laptop, you can use MEGO to charge your phone. When doing this, FIRST set the output voltage to 5V or below, and connect to the output USB port. The default charging current is 500mA. 
 


What's been shown in this campaign is our prototype of MEGO, and of course the actual product will look even better!
Having supported by our backers, we will have more resources and funding to put in MEGO production, and invest more in the development further projects, which are featured with more functionality, better portability and nicer usability.
 


The idea of MEGO was conceived by our dream chasers who yearned to make a difference on how our younger generations are motivated and enlightened with engineering and science today.
Back to those days at our beautiful school, Simon Fraser University, where we enjoyed the struggling of debugging circuits in the labs for days and nights, we were motivated to come up with an invention that can truly help us with our labs and projects. For the same goal,we reunited after graduation and collaborate on what became our first pre-commercial project, MEGO. 
Before the team-up, each of the members have received adequate electronics knowledge at university and have gone through practical training during industry internships/researches. During years of graduate studies in the engineering and industrial practices, we developed outstanding skills in advanced electronics design, scientific research and product development. While many of our research works were published at well-known technology associations such IEEE, SPIE and etc, and also have been acknowledged as patent registered at USPTO and CPO that are ready for commercialization. In addition, we have supervised multiple undergraduate Capstone projects (eight month long, engineering challenging projects completed by teams of five senior students) which led to success and fulfillment in their undergraduate career.
MEGO’s full-stack development process, including hardware design, manufacturing, supply-chain management, final integration and testing, are completed upon the teamworks of all members. The non-technical components of the project such as video shooting and editing were outsourced to our collaboration team graduated from SFU IAT.
 

Having supported by our backers, we will have more resources and funding to put in MEGO production, and invest more to develop further projects. MEGO, once born, is greatly loved by many high school students and freshmen who are curious about technology. With all sorts of unique advantages of MEGO, it is definitely a great companion and starter-kick for students to get touch with electronics.


Students from Riverside Secondary School, Coquitlam, BC, Canada
The series of these ongoing projects, a.k.a ""Lab-on-the-go"" series, will be our essential goal for next year. We believe these projects could be a great motivation for STEM education, and would like to contribute our best expertise towards our goal. 
In the end, we are dedicate to better help our younger generations enjoy the fun of inventing, and assist those who had dreams and passions! Hope to see you next year, with more of our fruits!
 

Risks & Challenges
To ensure the success of production, we’ve made multiple revisions of the 3D printed prototypes for MEGO, and worked closely with our partner manufacturers and parts suppliers. We also spent a lot of efforts to calculate the shipping rates from various couriers and post office to determine the most economic and efficient deal on your shipping.
However, our experience with crowdfunding is very limited, and we can predict that unexpected issues may happen. For example, shipping may get delayed due to some unexpected events such as strike, severe weather, holidays etc. For situations like this, we may have some buffer on our schedule. But we will ensure that we deliver your product and always keep you updated.

 
We also greatly appreciate if you could share this campaign to your friends or colleagues who have the passion and interest in electronics, hardware, engineering, inventing etc, since this might be the thing they have been looking for many years~~~",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3>RiCo is an Arduino compatible, simple and low cost robotic platform. It is meant as a low cost introductory tool to robotics. Rico will find its way around obstacles and follow lines. It will detect motion and react. <br/>Quite frankly RiCo is a combination of Arduino Uno, the Arduino motor shield and DC motor wheels. The former two have been stripped down to bare essentials, which reduces cost and power consumption. RiCo uses the Arduino atmega328P microcontroller and the L298 motor driver on a single PCB board which also supports the DC motor geared wheels. <br/>By default it uses two sensors to explore its environment: <br/><ul>

<i>TCRT5000 based breakout - fits directly on RiCO</i><br/><p></p>Additionally it can sense collisions or terrain inclinations by detecting curent through the motors.<br/><p></p>
Other than that... its up to you: you can attach breadboards, LEDs, bluetooth, RF, speaker, sensors... or anything you would plug into an Arduino. <br/><br/><h3>Technical stuff:</h3>
<p>here it goes straight up for the Arduino knowledgeable:</p>
<p>Digital pins 5,10,6,8,10,11 are reserved for motor control, they are accessible through neat high level functions such as <i>robot.driveStraight(int speed),  </i>or robot.stop();</p>
<p>Analog pins A0 and A1 are reserved for sensing current through the two motors.</p>
<p>Analog pins A2, A3, A4, A5 can be used also as digital input/outputs via the robot's library. <br/></p>
<p>All other pins have been brought out with 0.1"" headers and can accommodate the two standard sensors as well as other compatible sensors. There are four 4-pin port in the front and one at the back.<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What has been done up to now?<br/>
</h3>
<ul><li>I've made two iterations of RiCo and tested it at a high-school robotics course.</li></ul>
<ul><li>I've got a quick and dirty library that needs some additional refinements.<br/>
</li></ul>
<br/><h3>What still needs to be done?</h3>
<ul>
<li>In its current state RiCo uses an external programmer to be programmed. I want to include a FTDI USB2UART chip so the  only extra hardware needed will be a usb cable (and batteries). Two more hardware iterations will be needed for this. I never get it right the first time.<br/>

RiCo is an Arduino compatible, simple and low cost robotic platform. It is meant as a low cost introductory tool to robotics. Rico will find its way around obstacles and follow lines. It will detect motion and react. Quite frankly RiCo is a combination of Arduino Uno, the Arduino motor shield and DC motor wheels. The former two have been stripped down to bare essentials, which reduces cost and power consumption. RiCo uses the Arduino atmega328P microcontroller and the L298 motor driver on a single PCB board which also supports the DC motor geared wheels. By default it uses two sensors to explore its environment: 
a TCRT5000 based ir sensor on a breakout board for contour tracking
a HC SR04 ultrasonic range detector




TCRT5000 based breakout - fits directly on RiCOAdditionally it can sense collisions or terrain inclinations by detecting curent through the motors.
Other than that... its up to you: you can attach breadboards, LEDs, bluetooth, RF, speaker, sensors... or anything you would plug into an Arduino. Technical stuff:
here it goes straight up for the Arduino knowledgeable:
Digital pins 5,10,6,8,10,11 are reserved for motor control, they are accessible through neat high level functions such as robot.driveStraight(int speed),  or robot.stop();
Analog pins A0 and A1 are reserved for sensing current through the two motors.
Analog pins A2, A3, A4, A5 can be used also as digital input/outputs via the robot's library. 
All other pins have been brought out with 0.1"" headers and can accommodate the two standard sensors as well as other compatible sensors. There are four 4-pin port in the front and one at the back.

  What has been done up to now?

I've made two iterations of RiCo and tested it at a high-school robotics course.
I've got a quick and dirty library that needs some additional refinements.

What still needs to be done?

In its current state RiCo uses an external programmer to be programmed. I want to include a FTDI USB2UART chip so the  only extra hardware needed will be a usb cable (and batteries). Two more hardware iterations will be needed for this. I never get it right the first time.

I need to figure out production details.


  FAQ
   Will this be an open source project? Yes. Schematics and library will be published on a web site I'm building.

The campaign video looks really crappy, did you make it yourself?Yes. Its my very first video editing attempt (with Blender). Hopefully it conveys the message. 

Why did you make this thing anyway?
I wanted to play around with simple robots and show them to my son. I've made one out of an Arduino UNO stacked to a motor shield, plexi board, DC motor wheels, etc. The price was approaching 100€ which I found quite ridiculous. Plus, there were wires all over the place.  Why are you aiming for 2041€?It is for the 49 robots. 49 seems like a manageable number for a first batch. 
Will the batteries be included?No. You will additionally have to purchase 4 NiCd batteries. Same goes for the USB cable.

When I was a kid, I made my mom cry with a bad grade on my report card. Things would have never gotten so bad if my teachers would have told her ahead of time (I certainly wasn't going to do it). Now a teacher myself, I realize how busy they were. Still, I think: there has to be a simple way to link busy teachers and busy parents so failing grades don't fall through the cracks! 
So I got together with my sister, a former teacher, and made an app that we hope will make mom proud! 
 
 
 
Grade Switch is a mobile application that will revolutionize the way parents and teachers communicate. It's as simple as the flip of a switch:

Teachers (left): flip a switch as you update the grade book for every student who falls below a C—teachers are required to contact parents at this point anyway, so why not make it easy? A task that could take hours now takes a few seconds!
Parents (right): you receive instant text alerts when a child's grade has fallen before it goes on record when there's still time to help! What's more, the switch stays on until student grade has improved! No follow-up necessary. It's never been more simple and effective than this!

 



All In One Place
The average school teacher has 6 blocks per academic year, with 25 students each. That's 150 students! Imagine storing 150 contacts in your phone every year! How cluttered would your phone book be? With Grade Switch, teachers keep contacts neatly organized—by class, by student—making retrieval fast and easy. Separate your work contacts from your personal-life contacts on one phone: The epitome of work-life balance!
Easy Adding FeatureOur design is clean and simple. Add info for all of your classes in less than 5 minutes with our data fetching system! When the year is up, you can easily delete information in bulk, keeping things tidy. Teachers like tidy. The SwitchTeachers: we completely understand how often you take work home and contact parents off-the-clock. Don't get caught up in long conversations with hundreds of parents on your free time. Use Grade Switch instead! Reap the benefits of an actively participating class with virtually a few taps, consistently and effectively keeping parents in the loop.Text Messaging SystemOf course, we don't limit your communication. Text your heart out if that's what you want to do! You can even hand out stars ☆Calls Through the AppA switch is nice, but sometimes you just want to talk. No worries about sharing your personal number—calls are directed through the app—and you can set your availability for when you have time to communicate :)ReportsImagine this: You text a parent. No response. You call. Straight to voicemail. Hey, parents are busy too. But what happens when you're cornered at the end-of-year conference for not getting in touch? We've got your back! Texts, phone calls, and switch alerts are date-and-time stamped. Generate color coded reports so you can easily verify what was said (and when) without any confusion!    The SwitchDropping grades are an indicator that something is going wrong in a child's life. As a parent, you want to be aware of changes. Receive alerts from teachers the moment your child's grade falls from a C to a D. The switch stays on until grade improves. Messaging SystemStay in touch with your child's academic performance throughout the busy workweek. With Grade Switch, you can text, send and receive pictures, and file share with teachers.    
Grade Switch will increase parent involvement, resulting in:

Never again be caught hung-up on the go!</h3></div><div><p>The Hangaroo - an ingenious device that attaches to the label of your clothes or the strap of your bag to create an instant hanger. It’s a clever and simple design built to be long-lasting and extremely useful while maintaining the highest possible convenience. The Hangaroo features a discreet design that’s also safe and durable enough to hang your valuables on. The precisely calculated shape and carefully chosen materials mean that you can hang it on almost any edge, rail, hook, shelf, etc. so no matter where you are, you’ll have a spot for your clothes or bag. Never again be caught hung-up on the go!</p></div><div>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573095651/qlkrq92it8wlxnzhcwpe.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>There has never been a solution</strong> to this issue that comes even close to the Hangaroo. Carrying a hanger with you everywhere is unrealistic because of how big and clunky they are, and other solutions fail to address the issue with a convenient answer to the problem. The best part about the Hangaroo is there’s<u><strong> no need to remove it before you don your jacket and step outside. Just tuck it inside and out of view for maximum practicality,</strong></u> and if you do take it off, it’s so small you can fit it anywhere to take with you!</p>
<p> There’s a multitude of scenarios where people commonly find themselves with no hook to hang a coat, bag or other items of clothing, and no spare clothes hangers to make use of. Whether it’s driving, flying, taking the train, traveling otherwise, staying at a hotel or friend’s place, working at the office, or one of the many other possibilities, the Hangaroo will solve the problem with ease.

Never again be caught hung-up on the go!The Hangaroo - an ingenious device that attaches to the label of your clothes or the strap of your bag to create an instant hanger. It’s a clever and simple design built to be long-lasting and extremely useful while maintaining the highest possible convenience. The Hangaroo features a discreet design that’s also safe and durable enough to hang your valuables on. The precisely calculated shape and carefully chosen materials mean that you can hang it on almost any edge, rail, hook, shelf, etc. so no matter where you are, you’ll have a spot for your clothes or bag. Never again be caught hung-up on the go!

 
There has never been a solution to this issue that comes even close to the Hangaroo. Carrying a hanger with you everywhere is unrealistic because of how big and clunky they are, and other solutions fail to address the issue with a convenient answer to the problem. The best part about the Hangaroo is there’s no need to remove it before you don your jacket and step outside. Just tuck it inside and out of view for maximum practicality, and if you do take it off, it’s so small you can fit it anywhere to take with you!
 There’s a multitude of scenarios where people commonly find themselves with no hook to hang a coat, bag or other items of clothing, and no spare clothes hangers to make use of. Whether it’s driving, flying, taking the train, traveling otherwise, staying at a hotel or friend’s place, working at the office, or one of the many other possibilities, the Hangaroo will solve the problem with ease. People often resort to poor solutions such as hanging clothes on the back of a chair, which usually just leads to clothes falling on the floor. The Hangaroo provides a solution with no compromises, allowing anyone to hang most clothing items and bags almost anywhere they wish.

<p><b><b>What we Need  </b><br/><br/><i>We need to raise $30,000</i></b></p>
<p>We will use the funds we get from this « Kickstarter » campaign to build a working prototype for the website and the application, so we can start inviting people to join the loggining.com Community. Your support means a lot to us. Any amount will make a difference.  We know $30000 seems low for building a professional website and maintaining it. But we decided to go for the lowest funding goal possible to ensure that with your help, we can meet our funding goal as soon as possible, and hopefully even exceed it. </p>
<p></p>

<p><b><i>Our Stretch Goal</i></b></p>
<p>$30000 is the bare minimum amount we need to pay the programmers to build our MVP (minimum viable product), a working prototype with minimal features, server cost, and maintenance cost for 3 months. The real cost to build a fully functioning website with I year maintenance is actually more than $100.000, and that is our stretch goal - and we’re hoping that we can raise more than $100.000 so we can create a fully functioning website for at least 1 year.</p>

<p>Our biggest expenses for this project are adding the extra servers and storage to find, process, and serve data for a million(or more) logins. Although we believe we can be more efficient than our current setup, we're basing our costs on what we spend now to run <a href=""http://loggining.com%e2%80%99s/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Loggining.com’s</a>servers now.   We also are hiring some amazing machine learning consultants to ensure that we're doing this The Right Way. (We expect to make their names public very shortly after launch of the campaign.) We also will be spending a little money to make cool stuff to reward our backers, and, of course, there are Kickstarter fees.  <br/><br/><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">In Conclusion</b><br/><b style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/><i>Possible accounts for renting:</i></b></p>
<p><b><i><br/></i></b>- Digital TV content providers such as Verizon, Brighthouse, Comcast, HBO Now, Xfinity and others have a parallel app/website that you can view some shows on. Most consumers RARELY use this and they could “rent” it out to reduce the overall cost of their own service. </p>
<p>- Slingbox sharing in off-peak hours Sports card collectors use a paid monthly service called Beckett that is costly and could be included in your ultimate list of services to be shared. <br/><br/>- Online tutoring/training for children and adults could be included and shared. </p>
<p>- Kindle/eBook libraries that people have built up. <br/><br/>- Lynda, ebooks.com, Oyster, Entitle, Kindle Unlimited, Kobo, Barnes &amp; Noble<br/><br/>- Daily Burn workout program – Purely online system that could easily be shared.<br/> <br/>- Paid Amazon Prime accounts allow you to add up to four “relatives” to the account to get the free 2-day shipping. Someone could charge $15-20/year per person to add him or her and recoup most of the cost of Prime. This is separate from the TV service. <br/><br/>- VPN: HideMyAss, ExpressVPN, IPVanish, Buffered, Private Internet Access<br/><br/>- Apple store, Deezer, Spotify, Shazam, Soundcloud, Rhapsody, rDio, Youtube Red<br/><br/>- Canal +, Bein Sport, Orange TV, Swisscom TV<br/><br/>- WWE Network, Directv, Tidal<br/><br/>- SEO: ahrefs, semrush guru, semrush pro, majestic seo, moz, register compass, Brandyourself, premium google adsense and youtube adsense<br/><br/>- Premium Minecraft account</p>
<p>There are many other services that we could advise you on, this is just the beginning, so please do whatever you can to support this campaign and share our message and get involved - the subscriber revolution is upon us be a part of it!</p>

Users will list their account, including the GPS location and the facilities available and contact details, so that other users of the app, can search the accounts within a reasonable distance or a location that they choose, in order to request an exchange, rent or limited time free access. 
In the same way that remote access through hotspots works, users can view all the accounts of interest available within the set distance e.g. 10 miles/kilometers and then make a request or offer.


 Saving You Money  Exchange or rent your accounts to save money on your monthly bills. Instead of continually handing over your hard-earned cash to a TV streaming provider, simply rent your login and spend your money on dinner, and a good night out instead.  YouTube, Social Media:  Loggining.com is the perfect opportunity for YouTubers to enjoy the unlimited possibilities of thousands and even millions of views by simply sharing your account on loggining.com where you can post any number of videos to an audience of potential viewers looking for ways to “Netflix & Chill”. Other social media channels could benefit in the same way by posting a large number of videos, increasing the traffic and the number of subscribers, and eventually seeing your return increased by monetizing your YouTube, Facebook or Instagram page.


 
Gamers:  Which player hasn’t dreamt of having his character or his points evolve during his sleep? This is totally possible from now on thanks to loggining.com. Users can find a player that meets your high expectations on the other side of the world who will do whatever is necessary to develop your character and rack up those points by simply renting or sharing your account during your sleep.  
 Wi-Fi:  Unified connectivity is becoming more of a reality day by day and nowadays, every apartment includes its own Wi-Fi connection, providing access up to 10 users per building. So why not rent space on your personal Wi-Fi connection for a period of time or even longtime - sharing the bill and connection makes good commercial sense for everyone involved. By signing up to loggining.com the work of finding potential ‘sharers’ for your connection is done for you, all you have to do is choose the number and agree the deal you’re happy with. Simple!

Are you a visionary with a desire to be a part of an exciting new venture that will disrupt the existing subscription system status quo? Then we are interested in speaking to you. Here at Loggining.com we are opening the doors to our venture for qualified professionals to join us on our advisory board. So if you’re qualified or experienced in the areas of banking, the legal field or technology get in touch using the contact details below and lets talk about success on a global scale.




We appreciate your support  If you are unable to contribute financially, we will still need your support. Help us bring this project to light by sharing this page with your friends, family, and your online community. Every share, every tweet, every vote, and every like, brings us closer to our goal. We are super grateful for your support.
What we Need  We need to raise $30,000
We will use the funds we get from this « Kickstarter » campaign to build a working prototype for the website and the application, so we can start inviting people to join the loggining.com Community. Your support means a lot to us. Any amount will make a difference.  We know $30000 seems low for building a professional website and maintaining it. But we decided to go for the lowest funding goal possible to ensure that with your help, we can meet our funding goal as soon as possible, and hopefully even exceed it. 


Our Stretch Goal
$30000 is the bare minimum amount we need to pay the programmers to build our MVP (minimum viable product), a working prototype with minimal features, server cost, and maintenance cost for 3 months. The real cost to build a fully functioning website with I year maintenance is actually more than $100.000, and that is our stretch goal - and we’re hoping that we can raise more than $100.000 so we can create a fully functioning website for at least 1 year.



  How Will We Spend This Money
Our biggest expenses for this project are adding the extra servers and storage to find, process, and serve data for a million(or more) logins. Although we believe we can be more efficient than our current setup, we're basing our costs on what we spend now to run Loggining.com’sservers now.   We also are hiring some amazing machine learning consultants to ensure that we're doing this The Right Way. (We expect to make their names public very shortly after launch of the campaign.) We also will be spending a little money to make cool stuff to reward our backers, and, of course, there are Kickstarter fees.  In ConclusionPossible accounts for renting:
- Digital TV content providers such as Verizon, Brighthouse, Comcast, HBO Now, Xfinity and others have a parallel app/website that you can view some shows on. Most consumers RARELY use this and they could “rent” it out to reduce the overall cost of their own service. 
- Slingbox sharing in off-peak hours Sports card collectors use a paid monthly service called Beckett that is costly and could be included in your ultimate list of services to be shared. - Online tutoring/training for children and adults could be included and shared. 
- Kindle/eBook libraries that people have built up. - Lynda, ebooks.com, Oyster, Entitle, Kindle Unlimited, Kobo, Barnes & Noble- Daily Burn workout program – Purely online system that could easily be shared. - Paid Amazon Prime accounts allow you to add up to four “relatives” to the account to get the free 2-day shipping. Someone could charge $15-20/year per person to add him or her and recoup most of the cost of Prime. This is separate from the TV service. - VPN: HideMyAss, ExpressVPN, IPVanish, Buffered, Private Internet Access- Apple store, Deezer, Spotify, Shazam, Soundcloud, Rhapsody, rDio, Youtube Red- Canal +, Bein Sport, Orange TV, Swisscom TV- WWE Network, Directv, Tidal- SEO: ahrefs, semrush guru, semrush pro, majestic seo, moz, register compass, Brandyourself, premium google adsense and youtube adsense- Premium Minecraft account
There are many other services that we could advise you on, this is just the beginning, so please do whatever you can to support this campaign and share our message and get involved - the subscriber revolution is upon us be a part of it!

Risks The bigger challenge here is the security. What we are suggesting will be the target of MANY hacking attempts by those wanting to steal this valuable information. The services (ie. Amazon, Netflix, etc) trying to fight, block our service because it cuts into their profits. They have many dollars to fight us with.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

Video at 2x speed.   TAW board let  your ideas VISIBLE and it is 100% digital.     Which one do you prefer for your presentations? Our patented interface allow us to set the board high than 2 meters (79 in). Others boards (whiteboard or digital whiteboard) need to be placed below 2 meters (79 in) height, leaving it with low visibility and room to work.     Comparing 3 different kinds of boards with 2 meters (79 in) long. The DARK region is useless for a presentation purpose, you hardly can see there, unless you are sitting in the front row. Furthermore the ergonomic region, to add notes or to control information, of a person of 1.70  (67 in) in height, is from 1.30 (51 in) to 1,85 (73 in) height.   Presentation solution is a “critical tool”, it cannot fail and must be simple, so we made a small production batch, two years ago and started a paid early adopter program.Our beta testers (some above) paid around US 1,500.00 for each board. With a mass production we will cut to half that price. Our backers will pay less than that. We have more than 70 schools and offices using the TAW board in daily base, for almost two years.              Daily lectures in our beta test schools.          TAW board is composed of an optical pen, working as a mouse and as a whiteboard marker, software and a patented self adhesive film which can be applied in any flat surface (chalkboard, whiteboard or wall).The self adhesive film also works as a whiteboard film (dry erase) and projection screen.  TAW board+computer+ projector are all you need in your presentation room.We believe that, in a good presentation solution the presenter must forget the tool when using it. We spend a lot of time with ""engineers versus user"" discussions to keep it simple.Like a projection screen, the size of our patented film depends of size of your public and complexity of subject to keep all information visible. You decide it, from two (79 in) up to six meters (236 in).Two meters (79 in) long board and  3 meters (118 in) long board with two screen replications.A four meters (157 in) long board (Fair Bett 2015 BR ) and a five meters(196 in. The patented film was placed direct over the wall).Turn your classes into a good.The best about a 100 % digital presentation we can broadcast it in real time or record it. We could be watching, now an Einstein’s lecture capturing his way of doing science.Using any web cam you can capture presenter performance that appears at top right side in the screen.This transforms your lecture or your meeting into a goods, done without any additional cost. We will never more waist a “lecture”, now it is achievable.The impacts in education are huge:       1-Students can watch their teachers’ lecture at their own time.       2-Teacher can improve their lectures by watching their own lectures or others teachers’ lecture.They can even, sell it online.        3- At class, teachers can play their own recorded lecture. They don’t need to repeat the same lecture, again and again. They can spend their time teaching student to learn, not repeating subjects.        4- School managers or student parents can watch what are being teaching.At office you can record it for documentation or broadcast it, via conference call like Skype.  Our patented self adhesive film may  be installed at 1.1 m (44 in) or more from the floor to increase visibility. It is 1.2 meters (47 in) wide to fit standard whiteboard.Installing the film on a whiteboard (4 meters (157 in) board) andover a ACM panel fixed on the wall (3 meters (118 in) board)Adjusting two projectors in a 6 meters (236 in) long board. For boards with lengths above 3 meters (118 in), we recommend two projectors.Those are possible configuration using one or two projectors. The diameters are in “inche” others measures are in meter ( 39 in).Do not worry about room height by software we can reduce the projection wideness (aspect ratio) to avoid low roof or wall obstaclesTawitech was founded in 2005 to market talkandwrite, a premium Skype plug-in. In 2009, it was awarded as the most innovative small business in Santa Catarina (BR) ""Stemmer Award"".Marcelo, our CEO, is a former mathematics professor, PHD at Warwick University UK 1983. He was very disappointed when he used a digital whiteboard for the first time in 2009.“It [digital whiteboard] is a kindergarten tool. No room for a complex subject and only few students can see it “As a mathematician and computer scientist, he laid the foundations for this solution. It has become two patents pending (already patented in USA, UA and JP).His first prototype was an adapted “Vision Machine”. With this, he was able to raised money from angel investor in Brazil in 2012.In 2013 we finished our first prototype batch and released it at Educar/Betti fair for testing the market reactions.At that time our prototype used a projection screen instead our current self adhesive film. The tests proved that the projection screen causes premature wear of pen tip due the friction. Besides it adds more production and shipping costs. By the end of 2014, we found our self adhesive film supplier, ideal for ours needs. With the injection molds ready and all electronics components supplier defined we did a first pen pre-production batch.Optical Pen prototype (2013)  and   Optical Pen production (2015).In April 2015 we released TAW board at Pioneers festival (Vienna Austria ) and at Bett/Educar SP BR and started a paid early adopter tests. During that time we did some improvements and now we fill comfortable to start a mass production.Our patented (US 9,576,230 B2)  technology is position dot code and a patented interface software that create the functional PC screen inside the whiteboard, that software allow us to controls computer independently the PC screen size.  Our dot code is similar with anoto (www.anoto.com) code but in our case any domestic print can print that code.Our self adhesive film is composed by a layer of white PVC self adhesive film printed with our dot code, covered by a clear PET film with a hard coating. That PET film protects the printed code, assures the dry-erase property and no-reflecting for projections purposes. We print our code “in house” with large format plotter over that PVC film. It can be easily outsourced if necessary.     We designed our electronics using off-the-shelf electronic components and the assembly process will be outsourced with same company we worked in our first production bunch.  TAW board kits and some whiteboard films  ready to be cut & packed.Our software is very simple and light. It is a stable version; we haven’t changed it for past two years. Currently, we are working in a new version that should be release by the end of next year with a MAC version included. If you are a Mac user, backing us will shorter the developing time.Today our software is “Freeware” but we could change our policy, in any case we assure our backers 5 year of free update and upgrade. To run it, you will need a Windows PC with more of 4GB RAM memory and a video board with at least two video output (One extra HDMI output for your projector), any laptop has it. We need at least 4GB of RAM memory because you may be watching a video in your virtual PC and recording your lecture, it takes a lot of video board resources. After our beta test period, we are confident to offer a FIVE YEARS warranty for our whiteboard film and ONE YEAR warranty for our electronic kit, pen & case, excluding the battery that is a three month warranty period. We selected the best performance and durability Li-ion battery. It is one of more expensive electronic item, the unique consumable item in our optical pen. It should last at least 500 charge/discharge cycles and it can be replaced.Accidents do happen.The biggest concern of our beta users was replacements cost of pen & case, to reassure them we create:For only $ 29, you can buy one year insurance that will cover all types of accidents. We also have warranty options and express service below.Standard service: included.Battery replacement: $ 25.Service out of warranty: $ 20 + parts.Extended warranty: $ 25 (+1 year):Insurance: $ 29 (One year):Express service : $ 20.(ship Next day)Combo (Extended warranty + Insurance + Express service): $ 49.Offer for our indiegogo backers: Combo (Extended warranty + Insurance + Express service): $ 39.All  prices are per kit (optical pen and case)Conditions :Our standard maintenance service is to mail your repaired kit within two working days of receipt.Battery replacement: Includes new battery and service.Service out of warranty: Unless the motherboard is exchanged, the cost of this service will be less than USD 50.Extended warranty: You can purchase this extended warranty while your kit is on warranty.Insurance (One year):Insurance against accidents.You can purchase this insurance before kit is shipped to you or on a renewal. Validity one year if not used. Battery not included.Express service: We will send a replacement kit in less than 24 hours after your shipment.As soon as we are notified by you, on our website, that the kit has been sent, we will send you a refurbished kit on the next business day. You will be charged for maintenance only if this service is not covered by warranty. You need to provide us with the tracking number, your kit number and the number of a credit card which will be used for the payment of shipping it to you and the maintenance costs if any. As soon as we receive your kit you will be informed of the exact amount. You will be charged for each time this service is used.Combo; Extended warranty+Insurance+Express service: If the service is covered by the warranty, insurance and express service will remain valid.Do not try to fix your optical pen or its case. Pen or case with broken seal may not be covered by these offers.All shipping costs will be for user account. We will try to find the best shipping deals.  You may calculate estimate cost of standard TAW Pen + Case shipping (0.5 kg volumetric weight or 20cmx7cmx4cm) from Miami US or SC Brazil.About the whiteboard film warranty.Our supplier also provides well-known whiteboard companies in the market for more than 10 years. We spent a week visiting them to check their production and control. The hard coating applied over the PET that assures the “dry-erase” property is like a thin glass layer and it could be worn out by whiteboard eraser with dirty felt/fabric thus we recommend, to use a clean whiteboard eraser sponge.Use any “whiteboard eraser sponge”, do not use felt/fabric whiteboard erase.Since we have no means of controlling that; our warranty will not cover loss of “dry-erase” property. We will add in your rewards one “whiteboard eraser sponge” if you need replacement ask your nearby whiteboard markers supplier.Hint: Wait the ink to dry before erase it.To clean the whiteboard film, treat it in the same way you do with the glass windows, clean it with a soft sponge, water and mild soap. Ink residues may impair the functioning of the optical pen, thus clean it before you start a digital presentation.Our final recommendation:Forget the whiteboard markers unless the board is used as a news mural. The savings on markers and erasers can pay the cost of the TAW board.   We will be charging shipping after the Indiegogo concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship.

</p><p>The story of KARDS Robotics™ begins with Kade, a
middle school student, robotics enthusiast and budding entrepreneur who turned
his school project into an opportunity to create a new robotics development
platform. Like most kids, he loved building his own creations with LEGO® bricks and
other toy construction sets when he was little. But as he grew older, he became
interested in doing more and started exploring the world of robotics. Kade soon
found that making the leap from LEGO sets to robotics is complicated and (according
to his parents) expensive. When he was in sixth grade, he had to do a
“Capstone Project” which was a yearlong self-directed project on a topic of his
choice. Since he loved robotics, Kade’s idea was to invent a new robot design
system for kids. KARDS™, which stand for ""Kids Awesome Robot Design
System"", is the result of that project. With his parents help, he created
fully functioning prototypes for a core set of modules and now needs your help
to turn them into finished products so kids everywhere can bring their
creations to life and learn about robotics.</p>
<h1>Problem</h1><p>Millions of kids purchase and play with LEGO bricks. Many of them are also interested in robotics. However, bridging the knowledge, skills and cost gap between building with with traditional construction sets and creating functioning vehicles and/or robots that move on their own and can be programmed can be intimidating. LEGO MINDSTORMS® is great, but its costs more than $300. And making the jump to Arduino boards and “real” robotics platforms, motors, etc. is not only costly but can be overwhelming. There’s also the safety issue of soldering.</p><p>We see the need for a system that bridges the gap between familiar building sets that kids already know how to use and the more complex and expensive dedicated robotics platforms. One that allows kids to build robots by adding on to the sets they already have and already know how to build. A kit that appeals to kids as individuals, but also provides schools and makerspaces with another tool that not only makes
robotics and technology less intimidating, but is also modular enough to
grow with students and can be adapted to a wide range of ages, interests and skill
levels.
<br/></p><h1>Solution</h1><p>KARDS is an affordable, easy to use system that lets kids bring 
their creations to life without the problem of programming, 
soldering, and constantly buying new parts. The kit lets you add motion 
and lights to any LEGO compatible creation with simple, easy to connect modules. KARDS
 is made by kids for kids.</p><div>

The story of KARDS Robotics™ begins with Kade, a
middle school student, robotics enthusiast and budding entrepreneur who turned
his school project into an opportunity to create a new robotics development
platform. Like most kids, he loved building his own creations with LEGO® bricks and
other toy construction sets when he was little. But as he grew older, he became
interested in doing more and started exploring the world of robotics. Kade soon
found that making the leap from LEGO sets to robotics is complicated and (according
to his parents) expensive. When he was in sixth grade, he had to do a
“Capstone Project” which was a yearlong self-directed project on a topic of his
choice. Since he loved robotics, Kade’s idea was to invent a new robot design
system for kids. KARDS™, which stand for ""Kids Awesome Robot Design
System"", is the result of that project. With his parents help, he created
fully functioning prototypes for a core set of modules and now needs your help
to turn them into finished products so kids everywhere can bring their
creations to life and learn about robotics.
ProblemMillions of kids purchase and play with LEGO bricks. Many of them are also interested in robotics. However, bridging the knowledge, skills and cost gap between building with with traditional construction sets and creating functioning vehicles and/or robots that move on their own and can be programmed can be intimidating. LEGO MINDSTORMS® is great, but its costs more than $300. And making the jump to Arduino boards and “real” robotics platforms, motors, etc. is not only costly but can be overwhelming. There’s also the safety issue of soldering.We see the need for a system that bridges the gap between familiar building sets that kids already know how to use and the more complex and expensive dedicated robotics platforms. One that allows kids to build robots by adding on to the sets they already have and already know how to build. A kit that appeals to kids as individuals, but also provides schools and makerspaces with another tool that not only makes
robotics and technology less intimidating, but is also modular enough to
grow with students and can be adapted to a wide range of ages, interests and skill
levels.
SolutionKARDS is an affordable, easy to use system that lets kids bring 
their creations to life without the problem of programming, 
soldering, and constantly buying new parts. The kit lets you add motion 
and lights to any LEGO compatible creation with simple, easy to connect modules. KARDS
 is made by kids for kids.



KARDS-ifying LEGO® kitsWith our modules, you can create your own original vehicles, robots and more. KARDS is a fun and easy way to take your existing kits and add motion and lighting in any way you want. We dug through our bins of LEGOS and created these examples:

A Big Opportunity 

Approximately 7 LEGO sets are sold every second around the world. 

The world’s children spend 5 billion hours a year playing with LEGO bricks. 

LEGO MINDSTORMS is the best-selling set ever. Over 1 million of these have been sold globally since it's launch. 

LEGO has about 75% market share in the construction toy category.
On average, every person on the earth owns 86 LEGO bricks 

Laid end 
to end, the number of LEGO bricks sold in 2012 would stretch round the 
world more than 18 times. 


How We'll Use the Money



The funds raised during this campaign will be used to cover the costs related to turning our functional prototypes into real products. These include, but are not limited to, the following: 
Refining the existing CAD files as needed to optimize for manufacturing
Purchasing the injection molds required to build the plastic module cases
Producing the module case pieces
Purchasing other components that go into the kit
Assembling each module and putting together the kits

Education



Not only is KARDS fun for kids (and their parents) but the kit is also educational. KARDS is an affordable tool that teachers can use in schools to help teach kids robotics, inspiring students to become future and roboticists scientists. Students can have fun but also learn robotics, electronics, and science at the same time. 




The FutureIn the future we plan to create one or more advanced kits that will 
introduce programming, sensors, a remote control, and more. We also 
envision versions that would be compatible with other popular building 
kits like K’NEX®.





We created and programmed this cool ""Pet Treat Delivery System"" using our starter kit plus an Arduino board and an upgraded battery pack to show what's possible. If we meet our goal, we may introduce a stretch goal or additional perk that would include an Arduino module and other more advanced components.

Using some of the parts we have found in our basement we also created a functional biped robot that can walk! In the future we may even add a biped robot kit which will allow kids to create walking robots, and even program them.


A Brief History 

Along the way, we created a number of prototypes. Each one taught us a lot and allowed us to improve the functionality of KARDS. Here's a brief history.

Exclusively designed for the uniquely powerful Apple iPad/iPad Pro, Apple Pencil, and thoroughly tested with the GoodNotes app.</p><p>Hi! My name is Rick, creator of Braynstorm Digital.</p><p>I am considered a serial entrepreneur, designer, and artisan. I enjoy designing projects to simplify a mechanical or digital process, improve on an existing design, or merely sketch from scratch. Some call it tinkering - I call it creating.' There is always room for improvement,' - a phrase I take literally. Smoother, better, simpler, faster - nothing is safe!</p><p>My technical drafting experience began MANY years ago in motorsports. Long before, the computer-aided design was the norm. Then with the introduction of Adobe Illustrator 88, my design skills exploded. Technical drawings, transportation-related blueprints, Typography, I created a set of fonts exclusively for the laser and CNC devices. Now, I take great pride in creating the finest digital pads, planners, and journals.</p><p>SympleNote was inspired by my dissatisfaction with the conventionally designed bullet + grid notepads, planners, and productivity journals. The layout must be a minimalistic design but must be highly functional.</p><p>The bullet + grid note-taking/journaling concept is not new, and I like the idea. The format and overall layout of most concepts are where the whole design falls short.</p><p>So, instead of the long-established one page, figure-it-out layout, I have designed a series of easy-to-follow, multi-page, hyperlinked, note journals and planners for the Apple iPad/iPad PRO.</p><p>Many designs have a familiar <strong>line</strong>, <strong>bullet</strong>, and <strong>grid</strong>, but I have also created multi-size layouts and an exclusive '<strong>Hyper-Bullet</strong>' design.</p><p>The goal is to have a note journal or planner that is structured enough that you don't have to spend more time setting it up than using it. Yet still, have enough free space to support your productivity and creativity.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602072357/jwupxmcxl3fcppe3z0rr.png"" src=""""/></p><p>SympleNote won’t replace your sticky paper notes, but it will help keep them from getting in a wad that is impossible to read. Now your notes and ideas are in one place.</p><p>SympleNote is easy to store, easy to access, and as fresh as the day created. No more stacks of hard to find, mismatched notepads gathering dust.</p><p>SympleNote is easy to keep up with; seamless navigational hyperlinks allow you to keep notes tailored to how you work and get work done. Making notes, most importantly, retrieving those notes, should not be complicated and require extra effort.</p><p> </p><p>SympleNote consists of four different Digital NotePad Editions:</p><ul>

The conclusion was that all of these colors were great. All were easy on the eyes, so which to choose. The answer was obvious - include them all. Pick your favorite, or ideally 'color code' subjects or tasks.</p><p>On the other hand, the traditional 'graph-paper-blue' and 'tech-grid-green' just weren't enough.

Exclusively designed for the uniquely powerful Apple iPad/iPad Pro, Apple Pencil, and thoroughly tested with the GoodNotes app.Hi! My name is Rick, creator of Braynstorm Digital.I am considered a serial entrepreneur, designer, and artisan. I enjoy designing projects to simplify a mechanical or digital process, improve on an existing design, or merely sketch from scratch. Some call it tinkering - I call it creating.' There is always room for improvement,' - a phrase I take literally. Smoother, better, simpler, faster - nothing is safe!My technical drafting experience began MANY years ago in motorsports. Long before, the computer-aided design was the norm. Then with the introduction of Adobe Illustrator 88, my design skills exploded. Technical drawings, transportation-related blueprints, Typography, I created a set of fonts exclusively for the laser and CNC devices. Now, I take great pride in creating the finest digital pads, planners, and journals.SympleNote was inspired by my dissatisfaction with the conventionally designed bullet + grid notepads, planners, and productivity journals. The layout must be a minimalistic design but must be highly functional.The bullet + grid note-taking/journaling concept is not new, and I like the idea. The format and overall layout of most concepts are where the whole design falls short.So, instead of the long-established one page, figure-it-out layout, I have designed a series of easy-to-follow, multi-page, hyperlinked, note journals and planners for the Apple iPad/iPad PRO.Many designs have a familiar line, bullet, and grid, but I have also created multi-size layouts and an exclusive 'Hyper-Bullet' design.The goal is to have a note journal or planner that is structured enough that you don't have to spend more time setting it up than using it. Yet still, have enough free space to support your productivity and creativity.SympleNote won’t replace your sticky paper notes, but it will help keep them from getting in a wad that is impossible to read. Now your notes and ideas are in one place.SympleNote is easy to store, easy to access, and as fresh as the day created. No more stacks of hard to find, mismatched notepads gathering dust.SympleNote is easy to keep up with; seamless navigational hyperlinks allow you to keep notes tailored to how you work and get work done. Making notes, most importantly, retrieving those notes, should not be complicated and require extra effort. SympleNote consists of four different Digital NotePad Editions:

Classic (25 pages, 2 styles, 7 colors)

Steno (25 pages, 7 colors)

Cornell (20 pages, 6 styles)

Graphic (25 pages, 5 styles)
The SympleNote Layout COLORThe Classic and Steno pad layouts worked great in color. After various attempts at trying multiple pastel shades, I arrived at five calming colors while keeping two traditional colors for those wanting a familiar feel. The conclusion was that all of these colors were great. All were easy on the eyes, so which to choose. The answer was obvious - include them all. Pick your favorite, or ideally 'color code' subjects or tasks.On the other hand, the traditional 'graph-paper-blue' and 'tech-grid-green' just weren't enough. But white offered the greatest in contrast for the Cornell and Design Edition pad layouts.HYPERLINKSPage navigation is essential, though it can often be clunky and confusing. I have designed the hyperlink navigation to be as simple, yet complete as possible.SympleNote Digital NotePad SpecsMinimum Requirements

<p>Hello, we’re Carol and Wayne Hoofnagle, the designers of the mystudio.solutions carry case.  Carol is an Interior Designer working in the corporate hospitality industry.  “As a student I had to carry around a lot of tools in a clunky case and often had my hands full getting from class to class.” Wayne is an Industrial Designer in the tech industry. “I’ve designed cases for a wide range of products in the industrial world to make products easier to carry”.  Together we started discussing the need for professionals and students to have a much more efficient case that was durable, lightweight and easy to carry.  The result is the mystudio.solutions carry case.</p>

<p>Andrés and Roberto, two entrepreneurs born in Colombia, dedicated to the invaluable labor of teaching and accompaniment for children, youngers and adults for the sake of the communities their only purpose in life has always been to share knowledge, to help build dreams.  They took a chance to get aboard the entrepreneurs boat.  After years of hard work, sweat and a very effort, in which they quit their jobs to fight for this dream and make it real, Markaf slowly starts to be built.  So, with their ingenuous ideas, their desire of not giving up and the purpose to help businesses overcome the business bankruptcy… this story is born. To this adventure has been joined a new team member, who got involved with our dream and now is part of Markaf founders, this is Jorge, a systems engineer with deep experience in software developing, whom thanks to his important and specialized international software businesses knowledge, brought with him those puzzle pieces that t Andrés and Roberto were putting together. </p>

People that have the intuition and the firmness of keeping on making such a beautiful thing a reality that has been delegated to us to do.  People that in front of the world appear like crazy or irrationals, but have deep inside that “act of faith” to know that that’s the path to take, to help us to create the answers of an inequitable and absurdly unequal world.  To see over the mountain, to have the clarity, as well as to have hope that the sun will come out tomorrow, tomorrow this dream will shine in all its splendor.</p>
<p>We established a goal of $10,000 dollars for this campaign.  With the help of each one of you, we are hopeful that together we can make it happen, and like that show the world that dreams do come true. </p>

<p>We learn new things every day about
what we love and what we hate, but only when we give ourselves the space to
reflect on our experiences. Often, due to the rush of our daily lives, we
forget about this. The thing is, if we don't pay attention to our experiences;
assimilate the learning and apply it to the rest of our life, it's all for
nothing.<span>  <br/>

<p>Hi, my name is Gina. The idea for the SoulKompass
was sparked when Julia and I were walking around town one day and the only
thing we seemed to be hearing was <b>people complaining about their jobs</b>. Weird
right? If we spend the majority of our waking time at work, shouldn’t we be
doing something we love? Well, this got me curious, so I started talking with
people. What really surprised me was that the jobs we choose actually do fit
our skills. So why are we still complaining? What I realized was that while the
skills do match the job, it is at least as <b>important that our values and needs
are aligned to our working space</b>. During the last two years Julia and I have been
delivering seminars on personal and leadership development, helping people
discover their values and needs. <br/>
Now, we Julia, Lena, Basti and Gina, want to scale our knowledge to support more people. People like you.
That’s how the SoulKompass was born.</p>

<p>The concept of the SoulKompass was created throughout our own personal
development journey. The system and structure is based on our experience with
the facilitation of personal development and was then merged with the habits and
strategies the SoulKompass team already uses on a daily basis.</p>
<p>We have
worked on perfecting every page, line and dot to create a product you can
easily integrate into your day to day business. In keeping with the SoulKompass
philosophy, we decided to offer a discount for students and donate for
educational support in Tanzania. </p>
<p>The money
raised in this campaign will be used to order and manufacture the first bulk
order of the SoulKompass! Thanks for your support!</p>

Invest one
hour per week in the SoulKompass exercises and discover your values and needs, strengths
& passions together with friends or on your own – and have fun doing it!
Why? If you do not know what you're
looking for, you will probably never find it.
We learn new things every day about
what we love and what we hate, but only when we give ourselves the space to
reflect on our experiences. Often, due to the rush of our daily lives, we
forget about this. The thing is, if we don't pay attention to our experiences;
assimilate the learning and apply it to the rest of our life, it's all for
nothing.  
Only when we become self-experts are we able to recognize what we love.
To flip through the pages check out our upload here!





The first combination of weekly planner, personal development tool, journal, and community in one book!We wanted to create a tool that is easy to use – a weekly planner that combines
reflection, planning and action - for you to design a life you love.


Hi, my name is Gina. The idea for the SoulKompass
was sparked when Julia and I were walking around town one day and the only
thing we seemed to be hearing was people complaining about their jobs. Weird
right? If we spend the majority of our waking time at work, shouldn’t we be
doing something we love? Well, this got me curious, so I started talking with
people. What really surprised me was that the jobs we choose actually do fit
our skills. So why are we still complaining? What I realized was that while the
skills do match the job, it is at least as important that our values and needs
are aligned to our working space. During the last two years Julia and I have been
delivering seminars on personal and leadership development, helping people
discover their values and needs. 
Now, we Julia, Lena, Basti and Gina, want to scale our knowledge to support more people. People like you.
That’s how the SoulKompass was born.









Each week consists of two double pages - a weekly overview and space to work on the excercises and take notes!



Weekly Overview - From SUN to SAT, beginning at 6 am and ending at 10 pm. 

Daily Finances - Note down your income and expenditures right away. This way you wont forget all the little amounts that at the end of the month total up to a lot.


To-Do Lists - Organized by priority, divided into personal and work. 

Weekly Reflection - 10 minutes per week are all you need to see 
whether your life is on track. Track how you felt, check out what made 
you happy, what you achieved and what you learned this week. 

SoulKompass Exercises - Organized
in 12 chapters the exercises lead you to design your future by actively engaging
with your past, to embrace change through habit building. Additionally, the exercises support you in discovering your values, strengths and needs, thereafter helping you define a legacy. All it takes is 1 hour/week.








Weekly Exercises – Lots of space for you to work on your SoulKompass exercises wherever you go and whenever you want.

Reflection Questions – Specific questions aimed at you getting the most out of the exercises.

Personal Notes – Free space to journal, draw, make grocery lists or...












In order for us to print the SoulKompass we need to make a large purchase order for manufacturing. Any pledge amount brings us one step closer to our goal. Only if we reach the goal of 14.000€, will we be able to afford manufactuing as printing costs in our quality are only affordable with at least 500 copies. Your support will help create the very first combination of weekly planner and personal development tool, created in a long feedback process to help people, people like you, design a life you love.
Help us make
 the SoulKompass available to everybody by clicking the ‘Back This 
Project’ button at the top of the page, or by helping us spread the word
 by sharing our page.












The concept of the SoulKompass was created throughout our own personal
development journey. The system and structure is based on our experience with
the facilitation of personal development and was then merged with the habits and
strategies the SoulKompass team already uses on a daily basis.
We have
worked on perfecting every page, line and dot to create a product you can
easily integrate into your day to day business. In keeping with the SoulKompass
philosophy, we decided to offer a discount for students and donate for
educational support in Tanzania. 
The money
raised in this campaign will be used to order and manufacture the first bulk
order of the SoulKompass! Thanks for your support!

It is also the box, the connectors, and the printed circuit board (PCB) with many useful features. We summarize these in this introduction video of the RB:</p><p style=""background:#bb146b;padding-left:10px;color:#fff;font-weight:bold;font-size:14px;margin-bottom:0px;border-radius:8px 8px 0 0;"">Ratherboard's main board:</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/hL6q_4cT9dg?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0;&amp;fs=0"" width=""620""></iframe></div><p></p><p><strong>Now let's go over what you have just seen in the video:</strong><br/><span style=""color:#d06;"">■</span> <strong>The box</strong> is IP67 grade, which means, that it has complete protection against contact with solid particles (dust tight), and ingress of water in harmful quantity is not possible when the enclosure is immersed in water up to 1m.</p><p><span style=""color:#d06;"">■</span> A <strong>full connector set</strong> is provided to the RB. Read more about it in the “Ratherboard’s Connector Set” section!</p><p><span style=""color:#d06;"">■</span> The <strong>PCB</strong> has 4 layers and appropriate ground planes, which facilitate excellent EMC behaviour. We have also paid close attention to ESD protection while designing the product, therefore components dedicated for this purpose can be found at all the right places.</p><p><span style=""color:#d06;"">■</span> One of it’s main comfort functions is that the RB generates the<strong> 5V supply voltage</strong> for the RPI, and <strong>3.3V</strong> for other electronics which makes the integration of the components very easy.</p><p><span style=""color:#d06;"">■</span> The standard 40-pin Raspberry connector is <strong>compatible with the Raspberry Pi 3 and the Raspberry Pi 2</strong> devices. (Their main features are the easy-to-use operating systems, handling of an SD-card and any computer-peripherals.)</p><p><span style=""color:#d06;"">■</span> One major advantage of the <strong>RB</strong> is that it<strong> can be modularly expanded</strong> with the help of the extension boards as the used sensor inputs and output actuators require. By using either the existing extension boards or developing your own, you will be able to create a unique product in a faster and cheaper way. This is ideal for hobby-users and Sw-developer companies.</p><p><span style=""color:#d06;"">■</span> A built-in <strong>U-Blox GPS module</strong> enables the RB to be used in positioning and in anti-theft applications.</p><p><span style=""color:#d06;"">■</span> <strong>Six current-limited (protected) outputs</strong> are controlled by an I2C (TWI) interface port expander IC, and their hardware switches off automatically if the load exceeds 2,2 Amps. This protects the hardware in any unwanted situation.</p><p><span style=""color:#d06;"">■</span> A built-in <strong>I2C light sensor</strong> detects box-opening or sabotage, which can be logged or used to generate an alarm signal.</p><p> </p><p style=""background:#bb146b;padding-left:10px;color:#fff;font-weight:bold;font-size:14px;margin-bottom:-10px;border-radius:8px 8px 0 0;"">Ratherboard’s block diagram</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ratherboard.com/indiegogo/RB_2016_Usage_diagrams_SILVER_v1_.png"" src="""" style=""width:640px;""/></p><p>Just assemble your well-known Raspberry with a Ratherboard, connect a 12V (7-17V) power supply, and you will be capable to achieve everything your RPI enables.</p><h2 style=""color:#d06;font-size:40px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-top:65px;border-top-weight:1px;border-top-style:dotted;border-top-color: #ccc;margin-top:45px;"">Ratherboard’s Connector Set</h2><p><strong>A set of connectors is a standard accessory included to all RB packages.

We have been working one and a half years with the development of Ratherboard, and the preparations of the Indiegogo project. We treated this as an investment, during which we learned a lot, and created a tremendously useful device, the Ratherboard. We need to reach the fixed goal to manage the production with affordable unit costs, and to be able to keep all of our promises. 5 to 10-times more funding is needed to establish a sustainable production, test and fulfillment system.</p><p>We won’t be able to start the mass production without reaching the minimum goal. That is the key to being able to deliver your perks in a tested, excellent condition, and on time.</p><p>In return for your generous contributions, we've set up exciting stretch goals which will add more and more extra value for our supporters.</p><p>We prepared and offer really cool perks for beginners, experts, and packages for companies, group of friends and also large packs for partners who might be resellers and development companies who have faith in the potentials of Ratherboard.</p><p>Do not forget the Ratherboard T-Shirts!</p><h2 style=""color:#d06;font-size:40px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-top:65px;border-top-weight:1px;border-top-style:dotted;border-top-color: #ccc;margin-top:45px;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h2><p>With our experience in hardware development and manufacturing, at the project’s start we expected that the biggest challenge for us will be the organisation of the shipments. Depending on the number of backers and countries we planned to use perk fulfillment companies like Amplifier. As the project moved forward we received the offer, we couldn’t refuse: a contract with Fedex.</p><p><strong>Unexpected situations:</strong><br/>There could be difficulties along the way, but we are going to provide timely updates for our backers and do as much as we can to deliver RB to you on time.</p><h2 style=""color:#d06;font-size:40px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-top:65px;border-top-weight:1px;border-top-style:dotted;border-top-color: #ccc;margin-top:45px;"">Guarantees</h2><p><strong style=""color:#b06;"">Hardware:</strong><br/>We have been involved in dozens of development projects in the past years. As the employees of the Xtalin Ltd. we have helped out our clients when they were struggling with general hardware problems, reliability, EMC problems, etc. We have learned a lot and became self-confident in HW-development.<br/>Ratherboard is a fully operational working prototype. The only known flaws in the design, that we have swapped two subtitles on the overlay of the PCB. This means we will have a perfect pre-production test batch.</p><p><strong style=""color:#b06;"">Suppliers and manufacturing:</strong><br/>We are working with the most experienced international suppliers and manufacturers to minimize potential manufacturing risks.</p><p><strong style=""color:#b06;"">Software:</strong><br/>Software can not be an issue because of the marvelous RPI community, and the lot of free online example codes and projects. In addition, our aim is to build our online platform in a way that helps and boosts communication and sharing RB project experiences in the future.</p><h2 style=""color:#d06;font-size:40px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-top:65px;border-top-weight:1px;border-top-style:dotted;border-top-color: #ccc;margin-top:45px;"">Partners</h2><div style=""text-decoration:none;font-size:19px;font-weight:100;color:#777;""><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/aquashieldcontrol"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-decoration:none;color:#b06;"" target=""_blank"">Aquashield </a><span style=""color:#d06;"">|</span> aquaponics system based on RPI<br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/InnomotionStudio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-decoration:none;color:#b06;"" target=""_blank"">Innomotion </a><span style=""color:#d06;"">|</span> the provider of our beautiful pictures and videos<br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/greenaqua/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-decoration:none;color:#b06;"" target=""_blank"">GreeanAqua </a><span style=""color:#d06;"">|</span> the most professional aquariums in Hungary</p></div><p> </p><h2 style=""color:#d06;font-size:40px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-top:65px;border-top-weight:1px;border-top-style:dotted;border-top-color: #ccc;margin-top:45px;"">Other ways you can help</h2><p><strong style=""color:#b06;"">Buy Ratherboard as a gift, award or as a support to children or schools in need:</strong><br/>There must be talented youngsters, practice-oriented schools, enthusiast geeks in your surroundings who can benefit from the RB-advantages.</p><div> </div><p><strong style=""color:#b06;"">0 USD Support:</strong><br/>Even if you can't make a donation, or you can’t buy a perk, you are able to push Ratherboard one step ahead.</p><p style=""color:#444;""><strong>Here are some examples:</strong></p><p><span style=""color:#d06;"">■</span> <span style=""color:#d06;"">Recruit:</span> Send our campaign’s link to your friends and ask them to join the RB movement.<br/><span style=""color:#d06;"">■</span> <span style=""color:#d06;"">Share#1:</span> Use Indiegogo Share Tools to spread the word.

child, and we truly believe that with your contribution it will make the life of hobbyists and professional companies easier, and their work much more fluent, reliable and fun.RB Use CasesWe have selected some of Ratherboard’s endless application possibilities to make it easier for you to imagine how many areas could be affected positively by the help of the Ratherboard.Garden & waterHome gardening, greenhouse control, aquavaristique, aquaponics, pet feeder, barn remote monitoring.Ratherboard is ideal for timed and triggered actions like feeding fish or pets, watering the drying out potter soil, controlling windows, water pumps, ventilation, heating, and so on.We have implemented three example projects in this topic.Managing fish tanks with RB:RB home gardening...and the same on a much larger scale:Camera controllCamera control and video streaming for photography, home security, baby monitoring, ornithology, etc.Thanks to its various interfaces Ratherboard is able to control action cameras like GoPro, so you will be able to create unusually long timelapses, and upload the pictures to a server immediately. This way the memory card will never become full.Professional cameras provide an interface for triggering the recording, so Ratherboard may catch the perfect moment. Light-, noise-, motion-triggering or remote control will be fun with the RB.IP cameras can also be used with wifi connection as you can see on the U-stream video provided by a RB on the Ratherboard homepage.There are several RPI baby monitoring, and home security example codes on the internet, so RB can be used as a security system's control unit, and setting up such a system is child’s play.Last, but not least one of the nicest application fields is ornithology, when you are streaming the first days of the life of little birds in their nests.Weather stationLogging the weather changes could be a hobby project, but also an experiment, or part of the necessary documentation process in agriculture.Another great example is that one of our RB prototypes is constantly monitoring temperature and light intensity data on the roof of our office, and sends them to an online database through WiFi connection. The data thus obtained is shown on the Ratherboard homepage.Machine control2/3/5 axis machines’ control, like CNC machines (cutting, moulding, drilling), robotic arms, and 3D printers can also be controlled by a Ratherboard.Check out our home-made RB 3D-printer example video:RB 3D-printerHigh altitude ballooningIf you do not want to send the data to the cloud you might as well send the Ratherboard up into the real clouds… At the following link you can read about Dave Akerman’s projects where he sends RPIs to the stratosphere to collect data and take breathtaking pictures.Electronic displays, interactive citylights, and advertising boardsControl your electronic advertising devices with an affordable Internet of Things (IoT) device! Use a Ratherboard, and change your advertising material remotely through the internet.   Smart homes, RFID systems, vehicle home- and onboard-diagnostics, home brewery, fish bite indicator, RPI-reincarnation of old computer games, RPI server, Multimedia center, Lab and science projects, DIY Oscilloscope and other kind of laboratory equipment...
Yes, there are truly endless possibilities with Ratherboard!Ratherboard’s SystemArchitecture And Electronics SolutionsRatherboard isn’t only a Raspberry motherboard. It is also the box, the connectors, and the printed circuit board (PCB) with many useful features. We summarize these in this introduction video of the RB:Ratherboard's main board:Now let's go over what you have just seen in the video:■ The box is IP67 grade, which means, that it has complete protection against contact with solid particles (dust tight), and ingress of water in harmful quantity is not possible when the enclosure is immersed in water up to 1m.■ A full connector set is provided to the RB. Read more about it in the “Ratherboard’s Connector Set” section!■ The PCB has 4 layers and appropriate ground planes, which facilitate excellent EMC behaviour. We have also paid close attention to ESD protection while designing the product, therefore components dedicated for this purpose can be found at all the right places.■ One of it’s main comfort functions is that the RB generates the 5V supply voltage for the RPI, and 3.3V for other electronics which makes the integration of the components very easy.■ The standard 40-pin Raspberry connector is compatible with the Raspberry Pi 3 and the Raspberry Pi 2 devices. (Their main features are the easy-to-use operating systems, handling of an SD-card and any computer-peripherals.)■ One major advantage of the RB is that it can be modularly expanded with the help of the extension boards as the used sensor inputs and output actuators require. By using either the existing extension boards or developing your own, you will be able to create a unique product in a faster and cheaper way. This is ideal for hobby-users and Sw-developer companies.■ A built-in U-Blox GPS module enables the RB to be used in positioning and in anti-theft applications.■ Six current-limited (protected) outputs are controlled by an I2C (TWI) interface port expander IC, and their hardware switches off automatically if the load exceeds 2,2 Amps. This protects the hardware in any unwanted situation.■ A built-in I2C light sensor detects box-opening or sabotage, which can be logged or used to generate an alarm signal. Ratherboard’s block diagramJust assemble your well-known Raspberry with a Ratherboard, connect a 12V (7-17V) power supply, and you will be capable to achieve everything your RPI enables.Ratherboard’s Connector SetA set of connectors is a standard accessory included to all RB packages. A connector set contains: ■ 4 pieces of 12-pole connectors (The contacts are replaceable, so these number of connectors will you serve you properly forever.)■ 50 pieces of contacts■ 50 pieces of sealing plugs■ A standard 5.5/2.1 mm power supply connector■ Cable for providing supply voltageExtension BoardsKey Elements Of RB’s Flexible ArchitectureCurrent extension board typesE1EXTENSION BOARD 1The E1 extension board is an interconnection card, which contains built-in series input resistors, and ESD diodes. The user has the possibility to use pull-up or pull down resistors on these 12 specific inputs. We also provided a really cool, small-outline-18 breakout possibility, which will enable you to use a wide variety of integrated circuits in the prototyping area.E1 block diagramWant to get more details? Watch the introduction of the RB E1E2EXTENSION BOARD 2The E2 extension board incorporates 5 optocoupler inputs, and 5 optocoupler-outputs, which will be able protect the RPI mini-computer’s inputs in the most cases.

We have been working one and a half years with the development of Ratherboard, and the preparations of the Indiegogo project. We treated this as an investment, during which we learned a lot, and created a tremendously useful device, the Ratherboard. We need to reach the fixed goal to manage the production with affordable unit costs, and to be able to keep all of our promises. 5 to 10-times more funding is needed to establish a sustainable production, test and fulfillment system.We won’t be able to start the mass production without reaching the minimum goal. That is the key to being able to deliver your perks in a tested, excellent condition, and on time.In return for your generous contributions, we've set up exciting stretch goals which will add more and more extra value for our supporters.We prepared and offer really cool perks for beginners, experts, and packages for companies, group of friends and also large packs for partners who might be resellers and development companies who have faith in the potentials of Ratherboard.Do not forget the Ratherboard T-Shirts!Risks & ChallengesWith our experience in hardware development and manufacturing, at the project’s start we expected that the biggest challenge for us will be the organisation of the shipments. Depending on the number of backers and countries we planned to use perk fulfillment companies like Amplifier. As the project moved forward we received the offer, we couldn’t refuse: a contract with Fedex.Unexpected situations:There could be difficulties along the way, but we are going to provide timely updates for our backers and do as much as we can to deliver RB to you on time.GuaranteesHardware:We have been involved in dozens of development projects in the past years. As the employees of the Xtalin Ltd. we have helped out our clients when they were struggling with general hardware problems, reliability, EMC problems, etc. We have learned a lot and became self-confident in HW-development.Ratherboard is a fully operational working prototype. The only known flaws in the design, that we have swapped two subtitles on the overlay of the PCB. This means we will have a perfect pre-production test batch.Suppliers and manufacturing:We are working with the most experienced international suppliers and manufacturers to minimize potential manufacturing risks.Software:Software can not be an issue because of the marvelous RPI community, and the lot of free online example codes and projects. In addition, our aim is to build our online platform in a way that helps and boosts communication and sharing RB project experiences in the future.PartnersAquashield | aquaponics system based on RPIInnomotion | the provider of our beautiful pictures and videosGreeanAqua | the most professional aquariums in Hungary Other ways you can helpBuy Ratherboard as a gift, award or as a support to children or schools in need:There must be talented youngsters, practice-oriented schools, enthusiast geeks in your surroundings who can benefit from the RB-advantages. 0 USD Support:Even if you can't make a donation, or you can’t buy a perk, you are able to push Ratherboard one step ahead.Here are some examples:■ Recruit: Send our campaign’s link to your friends and ask them to join the RB movement.■ Share#1: Use Indiegogo Share Tools to spread the word.

<h2 style=""color: #243e61;text-align: center;"">Our IoT-enabling Solution: R-TEC</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The REAL TECHNOLOGY (<strong>R-TEC</strong>) is a commercial off-the-shelf solution for IoT enablement that overcomes technical barriers to new cyber-physical systems product development and deployment. By eliminating the need to develop any IoT function (computing, communicating, sensing, actuating, etc.), R-TEC offers <strong>user-friendly, flexible and widely usable electronic subsystems and services that allow rapid prototyping, engineering and delivering of high quality IoT systems for many application domains</strong> (connected homes and appliances, factory automation, smart cities, etc.).</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">R-TEC consists of:</p>
<h3 style=""color: #243e61;text-align: center;"">R-DEV</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523651301/tfy5sjtrqlu97wcbhxze.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The REALINO® device (<strong>R-DEV</strong>) is an end-to-end control device that enables other devices and electromechanic-based systems (home appliances, industrial machines, street furniture, etc.) to be controlled via the Internet through a device-agnostic hardware-software interface of connected actuator-sensor and expansion modules. R-DEV is made up of a wide variety of easy and ready to use printed circuit board modules that can be assembled and connected in many ways to construct custom control devices specifically suited to given IoT systems integration.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-top:20px;color: #243e61;text-align: center;"">R-PLA</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523651360/qfymwiytlwwlhop6quhr.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The REALER® platform (<strong>R-PLA</strong>) is a cloud-based and mobile-accessible platform that enables people to remote control their R-DEVs and manage interoperable IoT systems and applications, and also enables IoT system and application developers/enablers to make B2C business on top of semi-automated e-services. R-PLA provides horizontal services for all the IoT systems, applications and their creation, covering device management and ownership, security and privacy, data collection and analytics, and visualisation and external interfaces.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2 style=""color: #243e61;text-align: center;"">How R-TEC works</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">R-TEC leads IoT system and application developers/enablers to enable new cyber-physical systems in a simple, fast and safe way, looking ahead to adapt the outcomes to industrial readiness. They can <strong>focus on value-added capabilities for IoT systems and applications</strong> rather than to the most basic IoT requirements, and <strong>obtain profit from delivering and scaling up successfully</strong>. In this way, IoT innovation can be mutually beneficial, and stimulate business activity and increase acceptance of new IoT products and services introduction. Professional developers/enablers of cyber-physical systems will benefit from <strong>rapid implementation and industrialisation</strong> of such systems, and final consumers will benefit from <strong>performance, security and comfort improvements</strong> deriving from their daily use.</p>

<h2 style=""color: #243e61;text-align: center;"">What you can enable with R-TEC</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">R-TEC offers the possibility to develop a large variety of horizontal and cross-cutting IoT applications through integration of R-DEV and R-PLA. For initial introduction of R-TEC the focus is on the IoT market segments of Smart Homes and Smart Cities.</p>
<h3 style=""color: #243e61;margin-top:25px;text-align: center;"">SMART HOME</h3>

<h2 style=""color: #243e61;text-align: center;"">Why R-TEC?</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Current Internet of Things (<strong>IoT</strong>) technology implementations have the major drawback of being unsuitable for the prompt IoT systems and applications (<strong>SaA</strong>) enablement, and IoT SaA developers/enablers still do not have a system for rapid implementation of IoT-enabled cyber-physical systems (<strong>CPS</strong>), including retrofitting.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The main pain point we solve is allowing anyone with basic knowledge and do-it-yourself attitude to promptly enable CPSes for personal use or for commercial or other business uses.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We offer <strong>easy and ready to use tools</strong> that guide them throughout the entire CPS implementation process so that they can better plug the building blocks of IoT into electromechanic-based systems <strong>to quickly enable new Things to connect and communicate over the Internet</strong>.</p>

<h2 style=""color: #243e61;text-align: center;"">The Impact of R-TEC</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525570882/t6c46kmkojpt9878bm81.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>R-TEC end users will be mainly IoT System and Application developers/enablers</strong> (technicians, designers, engineers, installers, automation editors, systems integrators, etc.) who seek effective enabling solutions that can add new innovative IoT functions to electromechanical products and create new smart environments through versatile integration, initially in Europe and United States of America within the Smart Homes and Smart Cities sectors. <strong>R-TEC for IoT SaA developers/enablers will enable a more agile operating mode that reduces the typical development time from what is achieved today for do-it-yourself deploying more and more types of CPSes for the IoT by retrofitting, while reducing risks associated with the delivery of complex IoT solutions. As a result, other R-TEC end users (any client of SaA developers/enablers being final consumer), the SaA administrators</strong> (e.g. householders and people in charge of private-public structures and buildings)<strong>, will save a considerable amount of money thanks to a more holistic engineering approach that avoids replacement of their working electromechanic-based systems.</strong><br/> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525567186/tzx55z96mbiirsmvevnb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2 style=""color: #243e61;text-align: center;"">Socio-Economic Benefits of R-TEC</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">R-TEC and the prospect of <strong>a more agile operating mode for the deployment of IoT-enabled CPSes by retrofitting</strong> gives IoT SaA developers/enablers a concrete business opportunity to grow and innovate in a European and American market of over 800 million consumers. R-TEC allows them to <strong>provide IoT-based solutions directly to final consumers </strong>with low investment, more easily and faster, and is initially addressed to smart homes and cities applications. But R-TEC goes well beyond such value chain and application domains. R-TEC also allows IoT SaA developers/enablers to provide IoT-based solutions to manufacturing industries (e.g. CPS prototypes) and to private-public investors (e.g. Large-Scale Pilots projects). Therefore, R-TEC helps IoT stakeholders to achieve <strong>economies of scale</strong> (e.g. mass production) and <strong>economies of scope</strong> (e.g. mass customisation) which can in turn lead to substantial economic, environmental and social benefits in almost all areas.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Figure below shows the IoT value chain of R-TEC, including the different actors of this chain and the output of their business activities in order to deliver IoT-enabled systems and applications.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2 style=""color: #243e61;text-align: center;"">R-TEC Current Stage of Development – TRL7</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">According to the Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) scale, R-TEC can be placed at TRL7 – system prototype demonstration in operational environment. The IoT enablement of multiple kinds of CPS (TRL7) model (electric fan, luminaire, refrigerator, grow box, personal weather station) demonstrates the R-TEC system prototype in relevant operational environments (smart homes and offices). R-TEC, which consists of R-DEV (TRL7) and R-PLA (TRL6), is in the spectrum from lab to market.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Even though the TRL of R-TEC is considered at 7, there is the specific need to re-design the current R-DEV prototype (bringing the TRL of the R-DEV electronic boards back to 4) in order to make the ENABLE-IoT innovation business project a success. In particular, we have reached a limit point for the hardware-software development of R-DEV by using commercially available electronic boards that make the current R-DEV prototype to be uneconomic for IoT SaA developers/enablers to enable CPSes. To overcome this and other technical constraints, we have planned to develop our proprietary electronic boards that feature a completely new hardware architecture and firmware version.</p>

<h2 style=""color: #243e61;text-align: center;"">About RT and the Inventor of R-TEC</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The history of the Real Technologies company (RT) dates back to the year 2010 in Avellino, Southern Italy with a passionate automation engineering student, Sergio Lapenna. On his initiative to provide Internet users with an ICT solution for online resource management, Sergio designed the original web platform REALER® (2012) used to self-organise URLs into categories and switching usage modalities to have immediate access to groups of websites as set by the user. The idea behind REALER was to combine the use of virtual and physical resources into one service, and so he built the first prototypes of the device REALINO® (2014) which allowed to remotely control simple home appliances through the Internet. Thus began the materialisation of the REAL TECHNOLOGY.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Since then, the basic concepts (resources, modalities, etc.) and innovative tools (REALER and REALINO) have evolved into more complex systems with Internet of Things capabilities, and now there is a high interest in further developing the REAL TECHNOLOGY to address the future Internet that will impact on our daily life in almost all of the application domains. RT intends to follow up appropriately, in Europe, America and in the world.</p>

<h2 style=""color: #243e61;text-align: center;"">Objective: R-TEC Development</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The overall objective of the ENABLE-IoT project is to develop <strong>smart</strong> (efficient and ease to use), <strong>sustainable</strong> (able to deploy them with low investment and suitable for industrialisation) and <strong>certified</strong> (safe and secure) key IoT tools (device and platform) of R-TEC (R-DEV and R-PLA) for enabling CPSes (home appliances, industrial machines, street furniture, etc.).</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This crowdfunding campaign (monetary contribution of 1.506.284 euros and project duration of 16 months) will help us to bring the current R-TEC system prototype (R-PLA TRL6 – technology demonstrated in relevant environment – and R-DEV TRL7 – system prototype demonstration in operational environment) to <strong>industrial readiness</strong> (TRL9 – system complete, qualified and proven in operational environment) and <strong>maturity for market introduction</strong> (MVP for Smart Homes and Smart Cities segments). It will also help us to form a dedicated project team (11 members) that could <strong>shape new markets and disrupt existing ones</strong> in Europe, America and worldwide.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">R-TEC will be built upon <strong>3 pillars for a more effective “IoT single market”</strong> in which risks of fragmentation, lock-in and uncertainty do not exist:</p>
<h3 style=""color: #243e61;text-align: center;"">A single market for the IoT</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">R-TEC will be developed on the basis of available standards and communication protocols for <strong>Machine-to- Machine (M2M) connectivity and interoperability</strong>, with <strong>open interfaces (APIs)</strong> for IoT systems to operate across international borders and technological domains. The machine-generated data will be transferred, stored, processed and further transformed into <strong>data services</strong>, making it available, accessible and easily aggregated (FAIR), as well as trusted. A transparent and acceptable <strong>licensing scheme</strong> will be also developed for all players of the IoT value chain and for the relevant protected technologies of each IoT system.</p>
<h3 style=""color: #243e61;text-align: center;"">A thriving IoT ecosystem</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">R-TEC will provide an <strong>open, cross-domain, multi-vendor platform</strong> and <strong>horizontal, digital services</strong> to integrate many different types of consumer and industrial equipment and applications initially across the smart homes, buildings and cities vertical market segments, combining a set of IoT technologies, APIs and protocols with <strong>development and deployment tools</strong>. Based on bringing together multiple IoT sectors and stakeholders, R-PLA will comprise an <strong>online network</strong> of system and application developers including SMEs, researchers and innovators interested in IoT-based strategies for innovation and economic development. In addition, <strong>creativity- based innovation</strong> will be supported to foster smart, sustainable and inclusive IoT services and products.</p>
<h3 style=""color: #243e61;text-align: center;"">A human-centred IoT</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">R-TEC will adopt security and privacy by design approaches as an integral part of the systems development, making sure that <strong>data protection safeguards</strong> are taken into account. It will also focus on easy integration by design with a view to improving <strong>quality development of CPS products</strong> while keeping safety for users. A <strong>Trusted IoT label</strong> will be developed for industrial and consumer products, providing transparency about different levels of privacy and security.</p>

<h2 style=""color: #243e61;text-align: center;"">Implementation of the Project</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The funding will serve for the <strong>development of R-TEC (R-DEV + R-PLA)</strong>. The following tasks will be carried out, in parallel:</p>
<h3 style=""color: #243e61;text-align: center;"">Refinement of R-DEV requirements, prototype 3D design, engineering &amp; programming</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We will review and further elaborate the already identified features and characteristics of the ‘developer’ version of R-DEV, and produce the technical documentation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">A 3D prototype will be designed that will help us to assess, for example, the operation of electronic parts, the interaction of components, the welding process, any assembly issue or failure mode and other technical key parameters, keeping the cost as low as possible.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We will also design the firmware architecture of the new device modules that comply with the essential functional requirements of R-DEV. This includes writing of the initial code, as well as programming of the microcontrollers to build the first functional prototypes for debugging and testing.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We will work together with one external engineering-electronics company (subcontractor) during the electronic circuits design of the prototype and the cost analysis of the electronic components that need to be packaged together. Once the R-DEV has been validated, we will outsource the manufacturing process of the PCBs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">All our electronic boards will be compliant with the EU harmonised standards (LVD, EMC, RED and RoHS Directives) and the essential requirements for design and manufacturing (CE marking), as well as other specificities (e.g. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi certification). According to our globalisation plan and depending upon the application domain of R-TEC developed during the ongoing project, other regulation will apply to the final products (e.g. FCC, UL, Energy Star, MDD).</p>
<h3 style=""color: #243e61;text-align: center;"">Refinement of R-PLA requirements, design, development &amp; deployment of e-control and premium e-services</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We will review and further elaborate the already identified features and characteristics of R-PLA, and produce the technical documentation also taking advantage of the results of European/global projects dealing with IoT such as AIOTI, oneM2M and FIWARE. Moreover, we will carry out a cost-analysis of the R-PLA parts and design options which will help us to define the scaling-up cost.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The ground programming work will start immediately focusing on the e-control functionality, giving special attention to ensure technical, syntactical, semantic and organisational interoperability of standards for IoT. Features which can be adopted from the existing code will be implemented.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">From month 3, we will start developing the mobile apps for iOS and Android.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The improvement of the system software based on the current state of the art will be carried out internally to our company. We will also build the online integration framework also in collaboration with relevant sectoral organisations and industrial partners to provide IoT SaA developers/enablers with the essential information and services to enable and deliver new CPSes that integrate R-TEC.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our electronic communications services will comply at least with the EU Data Protection Regulation (Directives GDPR 2016/679/EU and NISD 2016/1148/EU). With respect to our international target markets, other similar regulations will apply (e.g. 23 NYCRR 500 in USA).</p>

</div></div>","Our IoT-enabling Solution: R-TEC
The REAL TECHNOLOGY (R-TEC) is a commercial off-the-shelf solution for IoT enablement that overcomes technical barriers to new cyber-physical systems product development and deployment. By eliminating the need to develop any IoT function (computing, communicating, sensing, actuating, etc.), R-TEC offers user-friendly, flexible and widely usable electronic subsystems and services that allow rapid prototyping, engineering and delivering of high quality IoT systems for many application domains (connected homes and appliances, factory automation, smart cities, etc.).
R-TEC consists of:
R-DEV

The REALINO® device (R-DEV) is an end-to-end control device that enables other devices and electromechanic-based systems (home appliances, industrial machines, street furniture, etc.) to be controlled via the Internet through a device-agnostic hardware-software interface of connected actuator-sensor and expansion modules. R-DEV is made up of a wide variety of easy and ready to use printed circuit board modules that can be assembled and connected in many ways to construct custom control devices specifically suited to given IoT systems integration.
R-PLA

The REALER® platform (R-PLA) is a cloud-based and mobile-accessible platform that enables people to remote control their R-DEVs and manage interoperable IoT systems and applications, and also enables IoT system and application developers/enablers to make B2C business on top of semi-automated e-services. R-PLA provides horizontal services for all the IoT systems, applications and their creation, covering device management and ownership, security and privacy, data collection and analytics, and visualisation and external interfaces.
 
How R-TEC works
R-TEC leads IoT system and application developers/enablers to enable new cyber-physical systems in a simple, fast and safe way, looking ahead to adapt the outcomes to industrial readiness. They can focus on value-added capabilities for IoT systems and applications rather than to the most basic IoT requirements, and obtain profit from delivering and scaling up successfully. In this way, IoT innovation can be mutually beneficial, and stimulate business activity and increase acceptance of new IoT products and services introduction. Professional developers/enablers of cyber-physical systems will benefit from rapid implementation and industrialisation of such systems, and final consumers will benefit from performance, security and comfort improvements deriving from their daily use.



 
What you can enable with R-TEC
R-TEC offers the possibility to develop a large variety of horizontal and cross-cutting IoT applications through integration of R-DEV and R-PLA. For initial introduction of R-TEC the focus is on the IoT market segments of Smart Homes and Smart Cities.

SMART CITY
APPLICATIONS


 
Why R-TEC?
Current Internet of Things (IoT) technology implementations have the major drawback of being unsuitable for the prompt IoT systems and applications (SaA) enablement, and IoT SaA developers/enablers still do not have a system for rapid implementation of IoT-enabled cyber-physical systems (CPS), including retrofitting.
The main pain point we solve is allowing anyone with basic knowledge and do-it-yourself attitude to promptly enable CPSes for personal use or for commercial or other business uses.
We offer easy and ready to use tools that guide them throughout the entire CPS implementation process so that they can better plug the building blocks of IoT into electromechanic-based systems to quickly enable new Things to connect and communicate over the Internet.

The Impact of R-TEC
 
R-TEC end users will be mainly IoT System and Application developers/enablers (technicians, designers, engineers, installers, automation editors, systems integrators, etc.) who seek effective enabling solutions that can add new innovative IoT functions to electromechanical products and create new smart environments through versatile integration, initially in Europe and United States of America within the Smart Homes and Smart Cities sectors. R-TEC for IoT SaA developers/enablers will enable a more agile operating mode that reduces the typical development time from what is achieved today for do-it-yourself deploying more and more types of CPSes for the IoT by retrofitting, while reducing risks associated with the delivery of complex IoT solutions. As a result, other R-TEC end users (any client of SaA developers/enablers being final consumer), the SaA administrators (e.g. householders and people in charge of private-public structures and buildings), will save a considerable amount of money thanks to a more holistic engineering approach that avoids replacement of their working electromechanic-based systems. 

 
Socio-Economic Benefits of R-TEC
R-TEC and the prospect of a more agile operating mode for the deployment of IoT-enabled CPSes by retrofitting gives IoT SaA developers/enablers a concrete business opportunity to grow and innovate in a European and American market of over 800 million consumers. R-TEC allows them to provide IoT-based solutions directly to final consumers with low investment, more easily and faster, and is initially addressed to smart homes and cities applications. But R-TEC goes well beyond such value chain and application domains. R-TEC also allows IoT SaA developers/enablers to provide IoT-based solutions to manufacturing industries (e.g. CPS prototypes) and to private-public investors (e.g. Large-Scale Pilots projects). Therefore, R-TEC helps IoT stakeholders to achieve economies of scale (e.g. mass production) and economies of scope (e.g. mass customisation) which can in turn lead to substantial economic, environmental and social benefits in almost all areas.
Figure below shows the IoT value chain of R-TEC, including the different actors of this chain and the output of their business activities in order to deliver IoT-enabled systems and applications.
IoT value chain of R-TEC
 
R-TEC Current Stage of Development – TRL7
According to the Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) scale, R-TEC can be placed at TRL7 – system prototype demonstration in operational environment. The IoT enablement of multiple kinds of CPS (TRL7) model (electric fan, luminaire, refrigerator, grow box, personal weather station) demonstrates the R-TEC system prototype in relevant operational environments (smart homes and offices). R-TEC, which consists of R-DEV (TRL7) and R-PLA (TRL6), is in the spectrum from lab to market.
R-TEC key milestones
Even though the TRL of R-TEC is considered at 7, there is the specific need to re-design the current R-DEV prototype (bringing the TRL of the R-DEV electronic boards back to 4) in order to make the ENABLE-IoT innovation business project a success. In particular, we have reached a limit point for the hardware-software development of R-DEV by using commercially available electronic boards that make the current R-DEV prototype to be uneconomic for IoT SaA developers/enablers to enable CPSes. To overcome this and other technical constraints, we have planned to develop our proprietary electronic boards that feature a completely new hardware architecture and firmware version.

About RT and the Inventor of R-TEC
The history of the Real Technologies company (RT) dates back to the year 2010 in Avellino, Southern Italy with a passionate automation engineering student, Sergio Lapenna. On his initiative to provide Internet users with an ICT solution for online resource management, Sergio designed the original web platform REALER® (2012) used to self-organise URLs into categories and switching usage modalities to have immediate access to groups of websites as set by the user. The idea behind REALER was to combine the use of virtual and physical resources into one service, and so he built the first prototypes of the device REALINO® (2014) which allowed to remotely control simple home appliances through the Internet. Thus began the materialisation of the REAL TECHNOLOGY.
Since then, the basic concepts (resources, modalities, etc.) and innovative tools (REALER and REALINO) have evolved into more complex systems with Internet of Things capabilities, and now there is a high interest in further developing the REAL TECHNOLOGY to address the future Internet that will impact on our daily life in almost all of the application domains. RT intends to follow up appropriately, in Europe, America and in the world.

Objective: R-TEC Development
The overall objective of the ENABLE-IoT project is to develop smart (efficient and ease to use), sustainable (able to deploy them with low investment and suitable for industrialisation) and certified (safe and secure) key IoT tools (device and platform) of R-TEC (R-DEV and R-PLA) for enabling CPSes (home appliances, industrial machines, street furniture, etc.).
This crowdfunding campaign (monetary contribution of 1.506.284 euros and project duration of 16 months) will help us to bring the current R-TEC system prototype (R-PLA TRL6 – technology demonstrated in relevant environment – and R-DEV TRL7 – system prototype demonstration in operational environment) to industrial readiness (TRL9 – system complete, qualified and proven in operational environment) and maturity for market introduction (MVP for Smart Homes and Smart Cities segments). It will also help us to form a dedicated project team (11 members) that could shape new markets and disrupt existing ones in Europe, America and worldwide.
R-TEC will be built upon 3 pillars for a more effective “IoT single market” in which risks of fragmentation, lock-in and uncertainty do not exist:
A single market for the IoT
R-TEC will be developed on the basis of available standards and communication protocols for Machine-to- Machine (M2M) connectivity and interoperability, with open interfaces (APIs) for IoT systems to operate across international borders and technological domains. The machine-generated data will be transferred, stored, processed and further transformed into data services, making it available, accessible and easily aggregated (FAIR), as well as trusted. A transparent and acceptable licensing scheme will be also developed for all players of the IoT value chain and for the relevant protected technologies of each IoT system.
A thriving IoT ecosystem
R-TEC will provide an open, cross-domain, multi-vendor platform and horizontal, digital services to integrate many different types of consumer and industrial equipment and applications initially across the smart homes, buildings and cities vertical market segments, combining a set of IoT technologies, APIs and protocols with development and deployment tools. Based on bringing together multiple IoT sectors and stakeholders, R-PLA will comprise an online network of system and application developers including SMEs, researchers and innovators interested in IoT-based strategies for innovation and economic development. In addition, creativity- based innovation will be supported to foster smart, sustainable and inclusive IoT services and products.
A human-centred IoT
R-TEC will adopt security and privacy by design approaches as an integral part of the systems development, making sure that data protection safeguards are taken into account. It will also focus on easy integration by design with a view to improving quality development of CPS products while keeping safety for users. A Trusted IoT label will be developed for industrial and consumer products, providing transparency about different levels of privacy and security.

Implementation of the Project
The funding will serve for the development of R-TEC (R-DEV + R-PLA). The following tasks will be carried out, in parallel:
Refinement of R-DEV requirements, prototype 3D design, engineering & programming
We will review and further elaborate the already identified features and characteristics of the ‘developer’ version of R-DEV, and produce the technical documentation.
A 3D prototype will be designed that will help us to assess, for example, the operation of electronic parts, the interaction of components, the welding process, any assembly issue or failure mode and other technical key parameters, keeping the cost as low as possible.
We will also design the firmware architecture of the new device modules that comply with the essential functional requirements of R-DEV. This includes writing of the initial code, as well as programming of the microcontrollers to build the first functional prototypes for debugging and testing.
We will work together with one external engineering-electronics company (subcontractor) during the electronic circuits design of the prototype and the cost analysis of the electronic components that need to be packaged together. Once the R-DEV has been validated, we will outsource the manufacturing process of the PCBs.
All our electronic boards will be compliant with the EU harmonised standards (LVD, EMC, RED and RoHS Directives) and the essential requirements for design and manufacturing (CE marking), as well as other specificities (e.g. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi certification). According to our globalisation plan and depending upon the application domain of R-TEC developed during the ongoing project, other regulation will apply to the final products (e.g. FCC, UL, Energy Star, MDD).
Refinement of R-PLA requirements, design, development & deployment of e-control and premium e-services
We will review and further elaborate the already identified features and characteristics of R-PLA, and produce the technical documentation also taking advantage of the results of European/global projects dealing with IoT such as AIOTI, oneM2M and FIWARE. Moreover, we will carry out a cost-analysis of the R-PLA parts and design options which will help us to define the scaling-up cost.
The ground programming work will start immediately focusing on the e-control functionality, giving special attention to ensure technical, syntactical, semantic and organisational interoperability of standards for IoT. Features which can be adopted from the existing code will be implemented.
From month 3, we will start developing the mobile apps for iOS and Android.
The improvement of the system software based on the current state of the art will be carried out internally to our company. We will also build the online integration framework also in collaboration with relevant sectoral organisations and industrial partners to provide IoT SaA developers/enablers with the essential information and services to enable and deliver new CPSes that integrate R-TEC.
Our electronic communications services will comply at least with the EU Data Protection Regulation (Directives GDPR 2016/679/EU and NISD 2016/1148/EU). With respect to our international target markets, other similar regulations will apply (e.g. 23 NYCRR 500 in USA).

<h3><i><strong>""I'm going to create the world's best productivity planner""</strong></i></h3>
<p>I told my mom, as she was the only person in the guest room with me at the time. It was on December 11th, 2017 when the idea of The Posimistic Planner was born. I was on a family trip to visit my grandpa in Mexico when i suddenly realized that I was going to be stuck there for 3 weeks with no internet, no sanitary bathroom, and no office to work in. 7 days into this vacation and my life is slowly going downhill. My diet was suffering, my acne was breaking out, my productivity was diminishing, I knew I needed to change but I was left hopeless without a sense of direction. On the 9th day of the trip was when It hit me, I was on my grandpa's guest bed and my mom was on the other bed across the room.</p>

<p>I was using a mass market productivity planner to review my day and I saw that it wasn't the best that it could've been. There were a bunch of useless features that didn't help me optimize my day, plan for tomorrow, or keep me accountable of my goals. This made me upset, how can someone create an average product and expect their customer to get an extraordinary experience? From that point on I made a commitment to create the best productivity planner the world has ever seen.</p>

<p>I open my journal, I start sketching designs all night for 6 hours straight until 8:00 am of how I want my planner to look like, what it's going to include, and how I can provide the most value.

If you struggle with prioritizing your day, our planner will help you. For entrepreneurs, workers, and people who want to live their best lives ever, the Posimistic Planner is here for you. We are mission oriented and our mission is to impact as many lives as possible because together we can change the world.
Risks & Challenges
The only risk you need to worry about is living with regret of inaction. I want to make this process as easy as possible for you, that's why we double check for any weak links in production, handling, and shipping to create a smooth experience.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Simon. I've been a games developer for many years and this involves using a lot of different Windows software and keeping track of lots of different files and projects. Through all my years using Windows I often wondered how much time I was actually wasting by constantly searching for files, going back and forth between programs and remembering all those shortcut keys for different applications. It may only be half an hour a day but when you add that up over the weeks and months it's a lot of time wasted. That's where the idea of Makross came about..</p>

<h3>What Is Makross?</h3>
<p>Makross is a Windows popup menu that can be summoned at any time from an easy to remember hotkey.  It's a menu that can be fully (and quickly) customized to contain all your shortcut links to files, folders etc. Not only that, but it also has lots of other functionality too including ; hotkeys, automatic program detection, macros, clip tray functionality, customization, folder/command set management and more!</p>

Hi, my name is Simon. I've been a games developer for many years and this involves using a lot of different Windows software and keeping track of lots of different files and projects. Through all my years using Windows I often wondered how much time I was actually wasting by constantly searching for files, going back and forth between programs and remembering all those shortcut keys for different applications. It may only be half an hour a day but when you add that up over the weeks and months it's a lot of time wasted. That's where the idea of Makross came about..
 

What Is Makross?
Makross is a Windows popup menu that can be summoned at any time from an easy to remember hotkey.  It's a menu that can be fully (and quickly) customized to contain all your shortcut links to files, folders etc. Not only that, but it also has lots of other functionality too including ; hotkeys, automatic program detection, macros, clip tray functionality, customization, folder/command set management and more!
It's there when you need it, and hidden when you don't.
I firmly believe that Makross is a game changer for how people use windows in any profession. With Makross teams and individuals will become much more productive!
I recommend you take a look at the website and try the demo to get a detailed understanding of the system.
What Is The Current State Of Makross ?
Makross has been released on Steam into early access and already has had some great reviews and feedback from users. However, in order to fully launch the product there are several improvements I wish to add. I also want to get more exposure and to receive more feedback from users.

What is The Funding For?
Here is what I need the funding for..

I have a bunch of features already that Beta users have requested that would be great to be implemented. With extra funding we can implement many of these. Without funding, adding features is just not viable. Some of these features include:
Additional Macro functionality
Additional language support
General usage and functionality improvements


I'd love to be able to put some money into marketing. The more sales we get, the more we can continue to develop features for Makross. In a world where it's hard to be heard this is a big challenge.


The Impact
I believe that Makross could and should be used in every workplace that uses Windows. If enough people knew about it and tried it, they would see how much time it really saves. By supporting this project you would be helping everyone to be much more productive!

Risks & Challenges
There aren't really any risks. Makross could theoretically be launched 'as is' but a successful funding campaign allows us to improve on an already quality product.
The only real challenge is in how to correctly spend the marketing budget for the biggest impact. (Any help or guidance is most welcome here)

Other Ways You Can Help

Provide us with feedback on how Makross can help you and what features you would like to see.
Tell your friends and share this campaign or a link to Makross on Steam.
Placing good reviews on Steam is good too :)

<p>Fidgeting gets more and more popular. Research says showed that fidgeting is actually beneficial :</p>
<p>Academically, the students showed growth in scholastic achievement when the fidget toys were implemented. The average writing score of the class increased from 73% without fidget toys to 83% with the use of fidget toys. In addition, the student with a medical diagnosis of ADHD showed the most progress with an increase of 27% on a writing sample (Stalvey &amp; Brasell, 2006).</p>

 *Buttons comes separate 
 
Why:
Fidgeting gets more and more popular. Research says showed that fidgeting is actually beneficial :
Academically, the students showed growth in scholastic achievement when the fidget toys were implemented. The average writing score of the class increased from 73% without fidget toys to 83% with the use of fidget toys. In addition, the student with a medical diagnosis of ADHD showed the most progress with an increase of 27% on a writing sample (Stalvey & Brasell, 2006).

<h3>I'm trying to help people with the annoying task of threading a garden hose onto a spigot. In addition I would like to provide some American jobs. All of my materials will be procured in the USA.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Robert Lloyd. I'm the inventor of the FASTNIP. My background is in aviation and mechanics.</p>
<p>Over the years I found that it's hard to install hoses on spigots when it's cold or if you have a hand affliction. My invention allows the user to slide the FASTNIP onto the spigot without threading it on. I'm always looking for a better way to do things, with the FASTNIP I think I have improved on the hose bib significantly. You will love how easy it slides on but it will amaze you even more when it's removed. You can buy various quick disconnects but they require two pieces to work and you have to install one on every spigot. The FASTNIP goes where your hose goes.</p>
<p>When you buy a FASTNIP you will be helping out American families. My goal is to put some Americans to work. When my campaign is funded I will be hiring machinists, assemblers, and construction workers. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>When the campaign is funded I'm going to erect a building on land that has already been acquired. Milling machines will need to be bought and employees hired. Some of the machines that will be purchased are as follows: programmable lathe, programmable mill, laser etcher, and numerous other items.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The FASTNIP will already be attached to a 5/8 inch hose in 50', 25' and 10' lengths. For all you pool and spa technicians that find your self cleaning filters at various locations throughout the day I highly recommend the 10 footer.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>My delivery date is going to be June 2018. That being said I will have to erect a building in the winter months which could be a little challenging. When the building is up there should be no stopping me. My initial run will come from local machinists. I'll be putting the FASTNIPS together and shipping them out the door.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I'm always open to suggestions. If you have ideas on how to improve the FASTNIP please feel free to drop me an email-lloydup1@gmail.com</p>
