I plan on creating an animated series titled “The Proposition” based on my most popular character  Mrs. Rebecca Keagan which will follow her adventures as a 43 year old high school teacher who gets seduced by one of her 18 year old black senior students. Originally ashamed by her sexual acts, Rebecca is slowly drawn into a world of infidelity and lust as her husband could no longer satisfy her lustful needs. Soon her friends and family members get pulled into her new lifestyle as a slave to her new acts all while struggling to balance a life as a respectable educator and a married mother of four. </div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>In the proposed animated series I plan to start off with a 12 episode season with longer episodes which will cover the comics from my website from like “The Proposition”, “Mrs. Hani: Big Ass Lebanese Teacher”, and “The Proposition 2”. I plan on expanding on the hot and steamy sex scenes as well as expand on some to the character plots. If the target goal is hit, the funds will help pay for the excellent team of animators that I collaborate with, voice actors/actresses, and a music/sound editor. If the projected goal is exceeded then the funds will immediately go towards creating the second season of “The Proposition” animated series which will go further into the Mrs. Keagan stories way past the comics and also tie in other comics stories like “The Sleepover” and “Home Instruction” as well as introducing new sexy characters and adding in many more popular characters from the Dukes Hardcore Honeys universe. <ul>

<p>What is ""The Proposition"" and What is it about?</p>
<p>The Proposition is an internet comic book series that I created in 2007 and published on my website as It follows the life of middle-aged teacher Rebecca Keagan as her life progresses from middle-class High school teacher struggling with her monthly bills into a popular internet adult star.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Where can I view the series?</p>
<p>The entire animated series will be shown on the website along with over 2 thousand pages of comics and art based on the series and other milf themed comics.</p>
</div><p>What will be the difference between this animated series and the webisodes on the website?</p><p>Well the web episodes were 1 to 2 minutes each where the new series it'll be 10 to 15 minutes. much longer with more story, more characters, and lots more hot Action!!

                           What we're asking for and the Important, ""Why"" ~

The $7,500 The Project is trying to raise will fund the renovation of our Ithaca, New York, U.S.A. working studio and soiree/performance spaces to accommodate the teaching, recording, and archiving of visual, musical, theatrical, and spoken-word art by creators of all generations, worldwide, with emphasis on giving exposure to emerging, artistic creators.
We give priority to the purchase of a specialized, high quality computer and audio/video recording equipment. This equipment will be used for creating and publishing free-access events of great variety, through our blogs, social media, and our new and unique website, which is now under construction, by and as a gift of Ithaca, New York's Cornell University.

         How, Why, and to What artists will your contributions be distributed?

                                                        Risks and Challenges
There are often risks and head-winds when creating a public, cooperative effort. In anticipation of such ups and downs, we've been investing our personal funds and resources to insure the project's unimpeded continuation and growth.
People value transparency and we are committed to openly answering all questions, addressing any concerns, and taking a sincere and thoughtful look at your suggestions and ideas. 
The project's expenditures and income records are being overseen and guided by an independent Advisory group, at no cost to us.

<p>Hi, my name is Beth Abaravich; I am a fashion designer, an
artist, a teacher, and a mom.  A
few years ago I took a class in silk painting, but instead of painting pastoral
scenes or bouquets of flowers, I painted graphic designs often incorporating
words. After that I started
covering furniture and it took on a life of it’s own.  My last big piece was <i>Altar
to My Teenage Self</i>, which I used in my portfolio for graduate school. I have been accepted to both The Art Center in Pasadena and Otis College of Art and Design.  </p>
<p>My campaign to raise funds for graduate school is important
to me for so many reasons.  I want
to engage the public and challenge myself to do so in interesting and thought
provoking ways.  I think being a female
artist right here and now is a huge responsibility.  Telling stories, that touch others and start conversations
is the beginning. Your
contribution would not only make my continuing education a possibility, it
would be a huge vote of confidence. 
Knowing others have placed their faith in me would definitely help push
me to go above and beyond.</p>
<p>Art School fees and art supplies will be paid by your contributions.  All funds whether I meet my goal or not will go towards some facet of my education.  It’s my hope to share my wearable art
with you in return for your contribution. 
</p>
<p>For every $85 contribution, I will send you a “35x”35 Hand
painted Scarf.  Each one is unique, and you can go to my website
bethabaravich.squarespace.com and pick out which one you would like.  
</p><p>For every $150 contribution, I will send you a “72 x “30
Serape Vest.  This is so cool because
it can be worn as a vest OR you can pull the long side through one of the holes
and wear it like a scarf.  Here
also you can go to   bethabaravich.squarespace.com and pick one out. <br/></p>
<p>For every $250 contribution, I will send you a Draped Silk
Vest.  These are beautiful because
they can be worn one of two ways, one way it’s shorter with a draped back.  Flip it upside down, now the front is longer,
with a slightly different design. 
These, too, can be selected from my website.  Please keep in mind
that each one is different and a work of art.</p>
<p>I graduated with honors when I received my bachelor’s degree,
and I expect to do the same here. 
The only difference is now I have two kids, so I have already started to
simplify my life.  I believe that
everything that seems like a hurdle is really your asset.  I’m older…so I have more knowledge and
experience.  I have kids…so I know
how to negotiate and edit what I say. 
There is always a usable angle that can elevate instead of bring me
down.</p>
<p>If you love what I’m doing, if you’re inspired, please share
it via social media.  Let’s spread
some good Indiegogo karma!</p>

<p>This tap wrench was designed 100% by the staff at Northern Machining. It is like no other tap wrench on the market today. The uniqueness of our wrench comes from its ability to maintain center with the central position of the tap, which it is holding. With conventional tap wrenches, center alignment is always lost because only one jaw, which holds the tap, moves. With our self-centering tap wrench, both jaws move uniformly, thus keeping a central position no matter the size of the tap which it is holding. <a href=""http://www.frets.com/HomeShopTech/Reviews/SmallShopTools/smallshoptools.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">View pictures from a satisfied customer.<br/></a></p>

Sometimes I miss that in Germany. Colorful small gadgets that

of renewable raw material. After use you can recycle it easily. The papers we
use are dyed through, with non-toxic, ecofriendly economic colors, so they can
develop their full brilliance of colors. entfalten. My friends in China, who
are involved in <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>the development, produce
LOVE PAPER with a lot of care and love. The production is not easy. Each sheet
of paper is glued on  68 points, with the
next loop precisely. So that’s the way we get this wonderful honeycomb effect.
They have to repeat this procedure approx. 250 times to get the stack for the
LOVE PAPER.</div><div><br/></div><div>+++</div><div>
<p><i>LOVE PAPER sind hochwertige Papier Produkte<span>, die aus nachwachsenden Rohstoffen hergestellt
werden. Die von uns verwendeten Papiere sind mit ungiftigen, umweltfreundlichen
Farben durchgefärbt, sodass sie ihre volle Farbenpracht entfalten. Meine
Freunde fertigen LOVE PAPER in China. 
Das ist gar nicht so einfach. Jeder einzelne Bogen  Papier wird an 68 Stellen mit dem nächsten
Bogen verklebt, damit  dieser wunderbare
Wabeneffekt entsteht.  Ca. 250  Bögen Papier werden so  miteinander verbunden. Die Bögen  müssen nun entsprechend trocknen, damit sie ihre Stabilität bekommen, bevor sie  mit einer entsprechenden Form gestanzt
werden. Sind sie gestanzt und an beiden Enden mit der Klebefolie versehen, kann
aus ihnen nun  sehr einfach ein
zauberhaftes Objekt entstehen.  Wenn Du
nun LOVEPAPER von beiden Seiten zusammenführst und durch abziehen der
Klebestreifen miteinander verbindest, 
entsteht Dein eigenes kreatives Objekt.</span></i></p>+++<br/><div>

<p>If there is
something  I like almost as much as
paper, that’s  flowers. Maybe because
they are also so beautiful, cute and colorful. But the packaging is mostly
hideous. Ugly paper or environmentally-unfriendly plastic foil.</p>
<p>With LOVE
PAPER you get an impressive arrangement easily from any bouquet /pot. View the
example images or my video clip right on and get creative by yourself.  By the way: Flowers are usually quickly withered.
LOVE PAPER provides an additional long pleasure as a decorative element or as
stylish solar shading.</p>

<p><b>PAPER
LOVE</b>  Blumen-Schmuck</p>
<p>Wenn es etwas gibt<span>,
was ich fast genauso sehr mag wie Papier, so
sind das Blumen. Vielleicht weil sie auch so schön hübsch und bunt sind. Doch
die Verpackung ist meistens scheußlich. Hässliches Papier oder
umweltunfreundliche Plastikfolie .</span></p>
<p>Mit LOVE PAPER arrangierst
Du  im Handumdrehen aus jedem
Blumenstrauß – oder  -Topf  ein eindrucksvolles Arrangement.  Schau Dir die Beispiel-Bilder oder meinen
Video Clip an  und werde selber
kreativ.  <b>Übrigens:</b>  Blumen sind
meistens schnell verblüht. LOVE PAPER bereitet länger  Freude als Deko-Element oder als stylisher
Sonnenschutz.</p>++++</div>

<p>There are 2 ways to use LOVE PAPER as a hat. Press the top side of LOVE

course you can simply slip in your PAPER LOVE as shown in the other pictures -
that’s the regular style. <b><a href=""https://youtu.be/k5yxIPGV7-s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://youtu.be/k5yxIPGV7-s</a></b></p>

Hey, I am Lei . I am born in Tianjin, Mainland China and live since over
15 years in the beautiful city of Cologne
in Germany. Together with some German and Chinese friends we developed the idea
of LOVE PAPER.
We love
paper because it is so versatile and sustainable. In my country
of birth China, people are working a lot with paper because it is very
flexible and with a bit of color, it brings much joy in every day.
Sometimes I miss that in Germany. Colorful small gadgets that
enchant the everyday life. That’s the reason why we developed LOVE
PAPER, the magic Paper to make every day to an happy day, with
 colorful love. There are so many opportunities  every day.+++Hallo, ich heiße
Lei und komme ursprünglich aus Tianjin in China und lebe seit 15 Jahren in Köln
(Deutschland). Zusammen mit meinen Freunden haben wir LOVE PAPER entwickelt. 
Das möchten
wir Euch gerne vorstellen. Wir lieben Papier weil es so vielseitig und
nachhaltig ist. In meinem Geburtsland  China arbeitet man sehr viel mit Papier, da es
sehr vielseitig einsetzbar ist und  mit
ein wenig Farbe viel Freude in den Alltag zaubert. Das vermisse ich manchmal in
Deutschland. Farbige Kleinigkeiten, die den Alltag verzaubern . Deshalb haben
wir LOVE PAPER entwickelt; das
besondere PAPIER,  das Dich jeden Tag mit
Liebe begleiten kann.+++
Do you know this situation? Somebody invites
you for dinner and you want to bring a small gift with you. A bottle
or some flowers or whatever. You find it, but it´s "" naked"". No
nice packaging material at home to make your present more  impressive.  Imagine  the great feeling if
you are able to pimp up your present without any
effort within seconds? No hazel or headache and
your amazing present is ready for a wonderful dinner. Yep- you can
get it :-)+++
Ihr kennt das Problem? Du bist eingeladen und bringst  schöne Blümchen oder eine Flasche mit. Aber
das einfach so „ NACKT“? Wie wäre es, wenn Du (einfach)Dein Geschenk   pfiffig verpackst und somit zusätzlich
aufwerten könntest. Und das sozusagen im Handumdrehen.+++

LOVE PAPER
-the versatile multi-artist!
-die  vielseitigen Multikünstler



LOVE PAPER is high valuable Paper Products made
of renewable raw material. After use you can recycle it easily. The papers we
use are dyed through, with non-toxic, ecofriendly economic colors, so they can
develop their full brilliance of colors. entfalten. My friends in China, who
are involved in the development, produce
LOVE PAPER with a lot of care and love. The production is not easy. Each sheet
of paper is glued on  68 points, with the
next loop precisely. So that’s the way we get this wonderful honeycomb effect.
They have to repeat this procedure approx. 250 times to get the stack for the
LOVE PAPER.+++
LOVE PAPER sind hochwertige Papier Produkte, die aus nachwachsenden Rohstoffen hergestellt
werden. Die von uns verwendeten Papiere sind mit ungiftigen, umweltfreundlichen
Farben durchgefärbt, sodass sie ihre volle Farbenpracht entfalten. Meine
Freunde fertigen LOVE PAPER in China. 
Das ist gar nicht so einfach. Jeder einzelne Bogen  Papier wird an 68 Stellen mit dem nächsten
Bogen verklebt, damit  dieser wunderbare
Wabeneffekt entsteht.  Ca. 250  Bögen Papier werden so  miteinander verbunden. Die Bögen  müssen nun entsprechend trocknen, damit sie ihre Stabilität bekommen, bevor sie  mit einer entsprechenden Form gestanzt
werden. Sind sie gestanzt und an beiden Enden mit der Klebefolie versehen, kann
aus ihnen nun  sehr einfach ein
zauberhaftes Objekt entstehen.  Wenn Du
nun LOVEPAPER von beiden Seiten zusammenführst und durch abziehen der
Klebestreifen miteinander verbindest, 
entsteht Dein eigenes kreatives Objekt.+++






The sheets must dry now approx . 24 hours
accordingly so that they get their stability. After the raw material is dried,
the will be punched to get her shape. With the last step they get an adhesive
foil to make the final assembling very easy. Please check my short video clip.

decoration. Let yourself inspire by the following examples and become creative.  Post your ideas on Facebook and join the Love

LOVE
PAPER Geschenk- Verpackung
Manchmal  muss es schnell gehen und trotzdem alles Top
aussehen. Schwierig? Nicht wirklich. J  Mit LOVE PAPER machst
Du aus einer schnöden Flasche ein sinnliches Objekt. Oder Du spendierst ein
paar Süssigkeiten eine aussergewöhn-liche Dekoration. Lass Dich von den  nachfolgenden Beispielen inspirieren und werde
selbst kreativ. Poste Deine Ideen auf Facebook 
und gewinn mit. 
Mein Tip: LOVE PAPER ist nicht nur  dekorativ. Im Sommer schützt Dich LOVE PAPER
ganz einfach als Sonnen-Hut, spendet Dir Schatten und sieht auch noch toll aus.
Deine Beschenkte/r wird Begeistert sein. J+++




Color up your gift or present it impressive or fancy and sweet. Your imagination is the limit with LOVE PAPER.

My Tip: LOVE PAPER is not
only a nice decoration. In summer LOVE PAPER simply protects you as a Sun Hat,
shades you and looks even more amazing. Your donee  will be thrilled.



COOL Candle with Magenta Robe

or  gift sleeve for bottle, ..or do prefer sweets plate. What ever you imagine make it true with LOVE PAPER.

PAPER
LOVE  FLOWER POWER

If there is
something  I like almost as much as
paper, that’s  flowers. Maybe because
they are also so beautiful, cute and colorful. But the packaging is mostly
hideous. Ugly paper or environmentally-unfriendly plastic foil.
With LOVE
PAPER you get an impressive arrangement easily from any bouquet /pot. View the
example images or my video clip right on and get creative by yourself.  By the way: Flowers are usually quickly withered.
LOVE PAPER provides an additional long pleasure as a decorative element or as
stylish solar shading.




+++

PAPER
LOVE  Blumen-Schmuck
Wenn es etwas gibt,
was ich fast genauso sehr mag wie Papier, so
sind das Blumen. Vielleicht weil sie auch so schön hübsch und bunt sind. Doch
die Verpackung ist meistens scheußlich. Hässliches Papier oder
umweltunfreundliche Plastikfolie .
Mit LOVE PAPER arrangierst
Du  im Handumdrehen aus jedem
Blumenstrauß – oder  -Topf  ein eindrucksvolles Arrangement.  Schau Dir die Beispiel-Bilder oder meinen
Video Clip an  und werde selber
kreativ.  Übrigens:  Blumen sind
meistens schnell verblüht. LOVE PAPER bereitet länger  Freude als Deko-Element oder als stylisher
Sonnenschutz.++++





LOVE
PAPER  Sun Protection with fun & style 

When it gets really
hot in summer, you can quickly sunburn in the face. With LOVE PAPER it is simple
to protect you. LOVE PAPER shades you and is breezy by the fine structure. It
also looks even more amazing. You're not sweating under  this kind of hat and nothing happens to your
hairstyle.

  

+++
LOVE
PAPER  Sonnenschutz
der Spass macht
Wenn’s im Sommer
richtig warm wird, ist ein Sonnenbrand im Gesicht oder ein Sonnenstich ganz
nah.  Mit LOVE PAPER schützt Du Dich ganz
einfach, denn LOVE PAPER spendet Dir Schatten und es sieht auch noch toll aus.
Da LOVE PAPER ganz leicht ist und die Waben Struktur prima die Luft durch
lässt,  schwitzt Du nicht wie unter
anderen Hüten und Deiner Frisur passiert auch nichts.
 
Ich
verrate Euch ein Geheimnis: Es gibt 2 Möglichkeiten, PAPER LOVE als Hut zu verwenden. Drückst Du  Paper Love oben zusammen, ergibt sich die
Form  wie Du sie bei Luci mit Candy 4 siehst.
Du kannst natürlich auch nur einfach so 
rein  schlüpfen wie auf den
anderen Bildern dargestellt. Dann hast Du  den normalen Style. Check mein Video J+++


  


Shall I tell you a secret?
There are 2 ways to use LOVE PAPER as a hat. Press the top side of LOVE
PAPER together. Another shape, like in the picture outside right is born. Of
course you can simply slip in your PAPER LOVE as shown in the other pictures -
that’s the regular style. https://youtu.be/k5yxIPGV7-s

<p>We are opening the
Chvrch of John in December of 2015, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The space is
going to be a restaurant, bar, social space and venue, celebrating art, artists
and music on a daily basis. We couldn’t be more excited!!!</p>
<p>While we will be
opening as soon as possible, we have had to make some budget concessions,
forcing us to put much of the wanted art on the back shelf for the time being. </p>
<p>We have started, and
will continue contracting many artists to produce items for the space, but
treating art as a business, we wondered, “What can we do to get them money
faster?”</p>
<p>This is where we need
your help.  While we will be able to open
and begin doing business, we are still looking to help fund these artists to
get their art made faster. The faster we can help get them money, the sooner
they can turn a profit, and in turn, go on to create more art! </p>
<p>While the campaign
goal is only a fraction of what we need to raise to pay for the items, it is a
base for us to help get them started.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp;

we want to help them build their businesses. Not only are they some of the most

FOR THIRD CONSECUTIVE YEAR, A READING FESTIVAL FOR THE MIAMI COMMUNITY
The Reading Festival  / Fiesta de la Lectura is an annual event organized by Cuatrogatos Foundation with the goal of promoting reading in
Spanish among kids, teens, and adults in the Miami community. These activities are not aimed at just the Hispanic community, but also the numerous people around the city that speak and study Spanish as a second language. This festival was held with great success in 2013 and 2014 and will be held again from October 2015. 


This is a free
event and is open to the public.
The program includes visits from writers and illustrators to different public schools in Miami
to converse with students and also includes reading workshops and creative writing, book
readings for adults, book presentations, plastic art expositions, storytelling, and theater.  


Each year we publish a poster and also a set of four book cards with stories and short poems
with illustrations. These materials are created especially for The Reading Festival / Fiesta de la Lectura  by wellknown
artists and are handed out for free between students, teachers, librarians, and parents
in Miami. 

The Reading Festival lasts for six days: it begins on Monday with events in public schools and
ends on Saturday afternoon is a great surprise activity outside for the whole family, staged on
the gardens of the Koubek Center (Miami Dade College). In 2013, we held a Carnival of Fantastic Animals and
in 2014 we held a Picnic of Books. In 2015, we will have an Afternoon of Stories from Around
the World. 


Cuatrogatros Foundation is a non-profit organization that develops educational and cultural products in various
areas around Miami and also through its website and social networks. Its management board
includes writers, illustrators, teachers, librarians, and actors. 


We are confident that through art, literature, and reading, the multicultural community of
Miami can reach a higher level of communication, knowledge, respect, and harmony. That is
why we are developing various events throughout the year that emphasize artistic education
for kids and teens. 

In 2015, we want The Reading Festival to be a larger and more massive event that reaches
more public schools. For that, we need greater financial resources. Your contribution to this
project will be very invaluable.




POR TERCER AÑO CONSECUTIVO, UNA FIESTA DE LA
LECTURA PARA LA COMUNIDAD DE MIAMI



Fiesta
de la Lectura / The Reading Festival es un evento anual organizado por la Fundación Cuatrogatos con el propósito de fomentar
la lectura en español entre los niños, jóvenes y adultos de la comunidad de
Miami. Estas actividades no están destinadas solamente al público hispano, sino también a las numerosas personas de la ciudad que hablan y estudian el idioma español como segunda lengua. Este festival se realizó con gran éxito en 2013 y 2014, y volverá a
presentarse en octubre del 2015. 
Es un evento gratuito y abierto al
público. El programa
incluye visitas de escritores e ilustradores a distintas escuelas públicas de
Miami para dialogar con sus estudiantes, talleres de lectura y escritura
creativa, recitales literarios para adultos, presentaciones de libros, exposiciones
de artes plásticas, cuentacuentos y teatro. 

Cada año publicamos
un afiche y también un set de cuatro tarjetas literarias con cuentos y poemas cortos
y con ilustraciones. Estos materiales son creados especialmente para la Fiesta
de la Lectura por artistas de reconocida calidad y se reparten de forma
gratuita entre estudiantes, maestros, bibliotecarios, padres y público general de Miami.  
Fiesta de la Lectura / The Reading Festival  se prolonga durante seis días: comienza un lunes, con eventos en
escuelas públicas, y termina la tarde del sábado con una gran
actividad-sorpresa al aire libre, para toda la familia, que tiene como

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is David and I am the author and illustrator for this project. When I was 17 I was diagnosed with degenerative disc disease and it has made it very challenging to find work to pay for school and the subsequent surgeries delayed my progress in life for a few years.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today I have found a job working at a local daycare center part time. Working here and with the kids has really inspired me and after just a short time there I was already working a plan to combine my love of art and writing to make a children's book.</p>
<p>Expenses are tough and finding time to work on this project has been even tougher. My hopes are that this campaign can help me create and share my vision and values with children and even adults.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>500$ is the goal set on this project. All of this money will be going to buying materials for the art work, contacting publishing agents/selfpublishing and helping myself afford spending time on the project. That being said even if this project does not reach its goal I will continue this project because it is a personal project of mine.</p>
<p>For perks I will have three different reward tiers. First tier will be a digital copy of the book, second will be a signed physical copy of the book third and highest tier will be a signed piece of original artwork used in the book. I hope that these tiers will be enough incentive to get this project moving.</p>

If you'd still like to support us visit: https://lavictrola.org/donate/ We'd really appreciate it! Why Are We Building A Giant Gramophone?In a world dominated by digital technology, La Victrola is intended as a large-scale organic counterpoint that celebrates the music and culture of a bygone era. Originally planned as mobile art, the 35 ft height and five-ton weight determined that La Victrola was better suited as a stationary sculpture and performance stage. La Victrola aims to educate, celebrate, and maybe even titillate by opening a door to creative expression from the past.What Does La Victrola Do?More then just a sculpture, La Victrola inspires interaction. During the day La Victrola provides shade and plays crackly old 78 records for all who pass by. The music creates a gathering point, sparking spontaneous flights of song and dance on its inviting stage.At night La Victrola hosts live cabaret performances beneath the organic curves of its massive Art Nouveau gramophone horn. These have included jazz, bluegrass, big band, burlesque, a full classical orchestra, belly dancing, flamenco, and much more.What's New and Different in 2017?In 2017 we plan to complete La Victrola by lifting the horn up off the ground, raising it up nine feet, and placing it on top of the actual gramophone box. This will complete the literal form of La Victrola as it has been imagined from the start.Details on the gramophone boxPeriod details on the box will include railings, staircases, lanterns, and a few other surprise enhancements to the cabaret. This full version of La Victrola will serve as a sunrise and sunset viewing platform in Deep Playa at Burning Man, where its unique musical program can flourish.With the horn 35 feet in the air, La Victrola's signature silhouette will be unmistakable.Remember That One Time at Burning Man Last Year?In 2016 we debuted a limited version of just La Victrola's horn supported on the performance stage. The 2016 installation verified that the piece is safe and that the core engineering and structural design is spot on.This year, in 2017, we are building on last year's success and bringing the best possible piece that we can to share with the Burning Man community.Who Are the Builders of La Victrola?More than 30 artists and performers from across Northern California came together to volunteer their time, energy, skills, and resources to build La Victrola at American Steel Studios in Oakland.Together, we are building much more than a giant gramophone, we are building a creative community.  What Makes Big Art So Expensive?Building art the size of La Victrola requires a daunting amount of money. The overall two-year cost to produce La Victrola is $200,000, and does not include the thousands of hours of volunteer crew labor, event camp costs, personal crew donations, or food for build week. The graph below shows the breakdown of our 2017 budget needs.We are grateful to have received an honorarium grant from Burning Man this year which will cover 25% of our 2017 costs, but we must still raise the remaining 75% on our own. This Indiegogo campaign must raise a minimum of $40,000 for us to complete La Victrola and bring it back to Burning Man this year.Your generous support will go directly toward the purchase of tools and materials, build space rental, transportation, logistical needs, and other equipment. We are deeply grateful to the community of friends, family, burners, and art lovers who have already supported this project.What Comes After Burning Man?The idea for La Victrola was conceived at Burning Man but La Victrola was always intended for an audience far beyond the Playa. We envision La Victrola making appearances at other music festivals, in urban destinations, and at locations with relevant music history significance.How Else Can I Help?As artists we know contributing money can sometimes be challenging. Community funded art can also succeed with in-kind donations to help bring the budget down. Metal, wood, sound equipment, lighting, tools, generators, furniture, powder coating, canvas, and paint are all donations we’d gladly accept. Let us know at info@lavictrola.com if you are interested in making an in-kind donation.Your help sharing this campaign with your coolest friends in all your InstaFaceTwitterGram channels is greatly appreciated! From the bottom of our hearts, we thank you for your support.And Now for the Perks!Be part of our 78 Club and get a small custom LEGO(TM) model of La Victrola.(not the final design!

I'm having an incredible career....for the last twenty years,writing and drawing the NANCY comic strip that is in newspapers all over the world, and teaching cartooning to kids of all ages for over 30 years! Now I have the chance to bring my love for teaching Cartoons to TV!<br/><br/>When I was just 24, Jim Henson chose me to write and draw The Muppets comic strip, and from there, my career really took off! Of course it did! I was drawing the MUPPETS! Jim also asked me to help create The Muppet Babies! I worked on Fraggle Rock with Jim, too! <br/><br/> Because of Jim Henson, immediately, I was in the spotlight, all over TV and the rest of the media, and being asked to make appearances all over the USA and the world! I was even Guest of Honor at the White House in 1984 and had my work enshrined in The Smithsonian. My love for teaching cartooning and motivating people to achieve all their dreams began right then! My dreams had ALL come true! I wanted YOURS to come true, too! That's why this TV show is so important!<br/><br/> I guess I'm a naturally born teacher and entertainer. <br/>Since I had little formal art training, coming from a childhood where we were poor and couldn't afford college, I learned everything on the job.  I began my cartooning career at age 14, and had all my wildest dreams coming true, I always felt compelled to help others reach their goals! I feel very strongly that whatever your lot in life is, no matter where you are in your life's journey...it is never too late or too early to make your dreams your goals and then....your reality! From nothing, I achieved success. I wanted to help others....with the gifts I had. And I did! Immediately, giving back by teaching cartooning everywhere I went!<br/><br/> As my career kept getting more and more successful, with me taking on the character licensing of other amazing cartoons like Loony Tunes, Tom and Jerry, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Tiny Toons, Pink Panther, and Minnie Mouse, along the way writing 59 children's books, and winning a couple of Reuben Catagory Awards from the National Cartoonists Society for Best Illustrator, and several Awards from the United Nations Children's Council. Oh, yeah... then I took over the iconic Nancy and Sluggo comic strip! <br/><br/>WOW. It's been a wild, fantastic ride! And through it all, my passion for helping people, entertaining and educating through stories and cartoons has been a major driving force! Now I want to bring all these passions to the TV screen, and I need your help to do it! <br/><br/>THE TV SHOW<br/><br/>Think ""Bob Ross""..... but on steroids and all about Cartooning! That's the show I want to make. And my partners? I've got some real heavy hitters from Hollywood who believe in this show very much and want to make a pilot, and that's going to run $25,000 in production fees. These folks have launched many TV shows, with several running today! They strongly believe that if we make this pilot, it will get on the air! Will you help? I've come up with all kinds of perks to give you in support of this project to thank you for your generosity.<br/><br/><br/>In gratitude for your financial support, I have perks available ranging 
from signed prints of my characters, signed books, original art from my 
Muppets and Nancy comic strips, custom drawings, personal phone 
consultations, portfolio reviews, career mentoring sessions....and I'll 
even go so far as to show up at your house and draw pictures at your 
party!! Really! Everyone who contributes will also recieve a link to the finished pilot! With folks contributing 20 dollars or more  receiving an autographed DVD of the show! I want this show to be YOURS as well as mine! And I want you to see where the money is going! I KNOW we can make this happen....with YOUR  help, and my connections and history!<br/><br/><br/>If we can raise this $25,000 for the production fees, by the way...the producers and director are putting their time in at NO CHARGE! They are ALL IN on this because they believe in this show so strongly! Isn't it time to bring Cartooning Education and Entertainment BACK to the TV screen?? When I was growing up, we had all kinds of cartooning on TV! Walt Disney and Walter lantz taught us how to draw their most famous characters and told us stories! Every little town had a Cartooning and Drawing Entertainer on the air! Now?? NOTHING! The kids and adults need this! I see it everytime I do a talk, do a tv appearance, a comic con, or invite folks into my studio! People are fascinated with drawing! Let's do this!<br/><br/>On this show, I will teach you everything you want to know about how to draw my characters, and how to create your own! I've created an entire curriculum that is fun and focused! I ran a Cartooning Academy in Connecticut for 7 years teaching! I also have had dozens of apprentices and interns who went onto amazing careers! Former students of mine have gone onto careers where they have won their own Reuben Awards, and have massive success. One is illustrating magazines and books for the biggest publishers! Another is animating shows on tv right now! More have huge careers in Commercial Art, Illustration, and Fine Arts.I want to do the same thing for the next generations. This show won't only be for art students, though! IT'S FOR EVERYBODY! Whether you want to draw along or not! You will be entertained! But think of it....art lessons if you want it, stories and entertainment whether you draw or not...and the chance to reach out to everyone! What about folks who could use some Art Therapy?! From children to seniors to the recovering, Art Therapy is a wonderful pastime.... and I want to be your guide  to the wonderful world of your imagination! And, man, will we have fun!! I've been speaking professionally for over 35 years and have entertained and educated literally at least 100,000 people in person, as well as millions through my guest spots on tv! It is my joy and my passion and I want to bring it to our very own TV SHOW! <br/>YOU will see the fruits of all our labors! You will receive links to the production, and DVDs autographed by me as soon as we are done with the production....which will start IMMEDIATELY after we reach our goal!!! We want to pitch this THIS SUMMER! Get on the air THIS YEAR! This is ready to go NOW! EVERYONE has cleared their calendars to jump all over this! This will be so cool!!! And YOU will know...YOU MADE IT HAPPEN!<br/><br/>OK....but What do we do if we don't reach our entire goal? Where will your money go then?  While I don't want to think we won't reach $25,000 dollars....if we fall short, I will use the money to put the curriculum I have already created up ONLINE  at our website, <a href=""http://www.nancyandsluggo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.nancyandsluggo.com</a> , so that folks around the world will still have access to LEARNING! to my teaching!

<p></p>
<p>We
are raising money to build our flagship store in San Francisco.  In
order to have the space we want in our hometown city, we are finding ourselves
competing against technology companies that are very well-funded, many of them
from overseas investors.  We want to keep this an all-American San
Francisco based business to allow locals and visitors alike the opportunity to
appreciate and support the amazing, locally produced goods from this region.  Our temporary store in Union Square was displaced last year by this competition - sad as we were the only locally produced store in the area!  <br/><br/></p><p></p>

<p>Makers Market is on a mission to <b>Rebuild
the Legacy of American Made</b>; and we need your support to make our dream (and
the dreams of the independent small businesses we champion) a reality.  We
curate the <b>best of American handcrafted</b> by searching the 50 states for
well-designed, durable and unique handcrafted goods. Quite a feat – but one we
are extremely passionate about. </p>
<p>Our brand is inspired by nature’s
perfect beauty, the spirit of American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, and
authentic craft that honors and respects those things.</p>

<p>With the loss of 650 American textile mills between 1997 and 2009, it is difficult for our makers to find American-made textiles to use in their products. At Makers Market, we try extra hard to find products made of textiles woven in USA mills, and products that source all US Raw Materials. </p><p>Why? Not only will you be supporting the end maker, but also the rancher who raised the sheep, the farmer who grew the cotton, and the mill workers that weave the cloth.  You'll notice many of our products incorporate Pendleton Wool.  This mill has been family-owned and operated for
more than six generations! </p>

</h3>We've been selling online for a few years. However, it was at our first pop-up shop in San Francisco where we saw first-hand the awe-inspired look of shoppers who LOVED their in-store experience. Smelling and touching the leather and seeing the quality of the product; they appreciate the heart and soul that went into making the goods.  Our stores are different, in that we have makers deliver product to the store (sometimes by bike); we have meet the maker events; makers customize product in the stores; we hold classes.  Ours stores are reinventing the current stale shopping experience.  <div>
<br/><p>To be truly inspired, people need the physical connection. We want the maker movement to realize its full potential and support makers in doing what they love, by connecting shoppers with the products first-hand.<br/></p>

</h3> We were invited to open a new shop in prestigious Santana Row, San Jose, where we will be one of the only local brands among National chains.</div>
<div>Opening a store is NOT cheap! We are looking for funding to help us build out the store - lighting, signage, handcrafted fixtures, point-of-sale capabilities, literature on the makers, etc. We want the store to be worthy of the amazing products we carry, and tell the story of the makers. </div>
<div>We also want to open our flagship store in San Francisco.  We want to give everyone the opportunity to shop small, support makers and have a positive impact on our community and our economy.</div>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Did you know that if we all spent just $64 a year on US made goods, it would support 220,000 jobs? Imagine the number of makers who would love the ability to do this full-time. You can make that possible. Shop local. Buy quality American-made goods, make sure products you buy are ethically made and you can change lives.  <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">By spending your hard earned $s on American made, you can make a significant impact on our economy and the lives of local makers.<br/></span></p>

<h3>What if we exceed our goal?</h3></span><p>Well, that's even better! We have plans for expansion, but more importantly to create a space for makers to make and have a support staff behind them to do all the 'other' things needed to make a business thrive. We want to be an entrepreneurial support center for makers. That's our passion. That's where we can truly make a difference and make sure the makers movement is much more than a fad.</p>

</div></div>","Rebuilding the Legacy of American Made
Hello fellow lovers of local, handcrafted, authenticity, and the genuine spirit of American entrepreneurship. 



Who are We?


A bit about us...Makers Market is
a retail marketplace launched in San Francisco, born of Southern
roots. We’re committed to supporting our 100+ (and growing every week!) independent artists and
designers from the Bay Area and US, by curating the best of American
Handcrafted all in one central marketplace!  
You can find talents like Kirsten Muenster, a 4th generation metalsmith and George Rocha, skateboard upcycler.  Every one of our makers has extreme talent and an intriguing story to tell.

  
We are a small business with a big vision to bring Makers Market to each major city in the U.S. that has a strong Maker base and a community and tourists eager to support these makers.

Why Support the Makers Movement?
The Makers Movement reflects the
love of authentic one-of-a-kind goods made by independent artists and
designers, instead of supporting huge fast fashion retail chains. Not only will
you feel good knowing you are Rebuilding the Legacy of American Made and
helping a maker live their dream, but you get cool stuff too! We've handpicked
our best sellers and exclusive items at a discounted price as perks for
investors!

Our Perks:





Our Next Store - San Francisco

We
are raising money to build our flagship store in San Francisco.  In
order to have the space we want in our hometown city, we are finding ourselves
competing against technology companies that are very well-funded, many of them
from overseas investors.  We want to keep this an all-American San
Francisco based business to allow locals and visitors alike the opportunity to
appreciate and support the amazing, locally produced goods from this region.  Our temporary store in Union Square was displaced last year by this competition - sad as we were the only locally produced store in the area!  
Our Mission

Makers Market is on a mission to Rebuild
the Legacy of American Made; and we need your support to make our dream (and
the dreams of the independent small businesses we champion) a reality.  We
curate the best of American handcrafted by searching the 50 states for
well-designed, durable and unique handcrafted goods. Quite a feat – but one we
are extremely passionate about. 
Our brand is inspired by nature’s
perfect beauty, the spirit of American ingenuity and entrepreneurship, and
authentic craft that honors and respects those things.





It was not long  ago that our communities were more connected...when skilled craftsmen, working with their hands and guided by their hearts and souls, made goods that lasted a lifetime.  It was before shopping in superstores with imported, mass produced product - with no story, no face, no meaning. That's where we come in....Our Products:  Modern + Heritage InspiredWe scour the USA to find products that honor the ideals of American craftsmanship and have a modern + heritage-inspired aesthetic.   In our quest to bring you the best in handcrafted, we have vetted each product to ensure it is well-designed, long-lasting and either organic, sustainable or ethically produced.The Prosperity Leather Tote is a great example of what we search for and is even more stunning in person. Durable hand-cut and hand-sewn construction with an eye-catching undyed vegetable tan leather body and straps.  Ferdinand's designs and makes heirloom quality goods using the finest natural and domestic materials available.  ""I'm inspired by the irregularity in handcrafted goods. The beautiful imperfection.""
We Strive for 100% US Content



With the loss of 650 American textile mills between 1997 and 2009, it is difficult for our makers to find American-made textiles to use in their products. At Makers Market, we try extra hard to find products made of textiles woven in USA mills, and products that source all US Raw Materials. Why? Not only will you be supporting the end maker, but also the rancher who raised the sheep, the farmer who grew the cotton, and the mill workers that weave the cloth.  You'll notice many of our products incorporate Pendleton Wool.  This mill has been family-owned and operated for
more than six generations! 


Our MakersHandcrafted items have a way of making us stop to appreciate and think about the story behind the product.  Everyone remembers the story of the maker…it’s what makes that everyday item special for years to come. We search for new makers with stories that are just as intriguing as their products.  One thing we love about the current
Maker Movement is the number of folks who have learned their trade from their
parents or grandparents and are forging their own path.  It’s a bold move
for a growing number of young adults.  Some people believe it’s like a
return to the good ol’ days where Americans were more self-sufficient.  We
love to find artists and makers who are carrying on a family trade in their own way … these folks hold
a special place in our hearts. 
One of our makers, Christina Nicole, has a studio in the North Carolina hills, and creates
jewelry and home goods using tools given to her by her grandfather.We believe in celebrating and memorializing our makers, you can check out the videos we've produced here.  

Our Unique Brick and Mortar Shopping Experience
We've been selling online for a few years. However, it was at our first pop-up shop in San Francisco where we saw first-hand the awe-inspired look of shoppers who LOVED their in-store experience. Smelling and touching the leather and seeing the quality of the product; they appreciate the heart and soul that went into making the goods.  Our stores are different, in that we have makers deliver product to the store (sometimes by bike); we have meet the maker events; makers customize product in the stores; we hold classes.  Ours stores are reinventing the current stale shopping experience.  
To be truly inspired, people need the physical connection. We want the maker movement to realize its full potential and support makers in doing what they love, by connecting shoppers with the products first-hand.

 

Why do we need your help?
 We were invited to open a new shop in prestigious Santana Row, San Jose, where we will be one of the only local brands among National chains.
Opening a store is NOT cheap! We are looking for funding to help us build out the store - lighting, signage, handcrafted fixtures, point-of-sale capabilities, literature on the makers, etc. We want the store to be worthy of the amazing products we carry, and tell the story of the makers. 
We also want to open our flagship store in San Francisco.  We want to give everyone the opportunity to shop small, support makers and have a positive impact on our community and our economy.

  


The Impact Did you know that if we all spent just $64 a year on US made goods, it would support 220,000 jobs? Imagine the number of makers who would love the ability to do this full-time. You can make that possible. Shop local. Buy quality American-made goods, make sure products you buy are ethically made and you can change lives.  By spending your hard earned $s on American made, you can make a significant impact on our economy and the lives of local makers.






What if we exceed our goal?Well, that's even better! We have plans for expansion, but more importantly to create a space for makers to make and have a support staff behind them to do all the 'other' things needed to make a business thrive. We want to be an entrepreneurial support center for makers. That's our passion. That's where we can truly make a difference and make sure the makers movement is much more than a fad.

The idea for Makers Market has been brewing a while… growing up in the Deep South, I spent hours with my dad in his workshop handing him tools, sweeping up the sawdust, handing him more tools, and receiving all of life’s lessons.  We’d ride through the countryside discovering potters, blacksmiths, textile weavers, and furniture makers. Watching and chatting with these craftsmen instilled a deep appreciation for those who design and handcraft one-of-a-kind product. Many times, these trades had been passed down through generations, and grandparents’ tools were still being used. We met the most talented, authentic, and down-to-earth people.  There was a deep sense of home and belonging.

About the show:


This will be the comic style animation, based on the true stories. And by the time and success of the project, we are planning to create full 2D animation contents. The whole story will be divided into the 5-6 parts in average, each part will be 4-5 minute long and will be released once per week on our youtube channel.

By the way, it will be at least in two languages English and Russian.
We believe that this project will become popular and attractive for millions of people in the world. The stories will be analyzed in depth and explained the reasons of the events in geopolitical and psychological scales.
We are not going to tell only what happened but also why it happened?
Here what we are going for - with this campaign we will do our first series (it is 7 episodes entirely) about the incredible story of David bek, an Armenian military commander and one of the most prominent military figures of the Armenian liberation movement of the 18th century directed against the forces of Ottoman Empire and Safavid Iran. In his age, this guy made impossible and brought salvation to his nation.
I know that you have not heard much about him and that is why we are trying to bring this great story to life!

<p></p>
<p>Located in the <a href=""http://www.bouldercreativecollective.com/#!/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Boulder Creative Collectives</a>' new 47th street studios, the Writer's Warehouse will activate the versatility of a studio to challenge the assumption that creation is best done in isolation. By bringing writers into spaces generally dedicated to visual arts, this project expands the creative landscape to nurture new ideas and unexpected works that push the boundaries of artistic disciplines.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to create an infrastructure which empowers a diverse group of Boulder writers to explore the the full potential of the written word in community with painters, sculptors, designers, photographers, architects, and more working in the BCC's surrounding studios. It also invites the Boulder community as a whole to participate in creative practice. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We have garnered an inspiring amount of interest in this project from organizations like BMoCA, BLDG 61, CU Art Museum, Jaipur Literature Festival, local small presses and more, but what we need now are the funds to launch!</p>

<p>Boulder Writers Warehouse is a true experiment — we don’t have a product we are trying to create; we aim to test the theory put forth in the City of Boulder's newly adopted <a href=""http://boulderarts.org/community-cultural-plan/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Community Cultural Plan</a>. We aren't claiming that our single space will touch the whole of our city; we are, however, confident that this project can serve as an important control-group to test and explore the tools outlined in the Cultural Plan, specifically those surrounding innovation, professional development, diversity, accessibility, collaboration, and community involvement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>BWW's projects and programming will provide important insight into who applies for this kind of experience and space, what types of events are successful, and which audiences we are attracting or not attracting with workshops and performances.

Ho pensato di creare questa campagna per cercare di rendere reale questo libro.
E' difficile riuscire a trovare un editore che pubblichi il tuo lavoro .. sopratutto se si deve lavorare 45 ore a settimana per poter pagare l'affitto ecc..
Con il gol di questa campagna spero di poter far conoscere il mio libro nella Fiera dell'illustrazione in Italia e Londra..

                                      


                        Other Ways You Can Help 
Even if you can not make a donation would be super helpful if you shared my progette on your facesbook pages !!!
Anche se non potete fare un donazione sarebbe di super aiuto se condivideste il mio progette sulle vostre pagine facesbook !!!

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Leaving in nowadays makes it nearly impossible to concentrate on your Art.  Most of us -musicians, actors, painters - have to fight through daily social problems.</p>
<p>Yet...... we all have dreams !</p>
</div><div>
<p>The entire amount of the campaign will be used strictly for trip expences, such as  plane tickets, accomodation, food and any other accidental situation that can happen during such big trip.</p>
<p>For this campaign I have some really interesting Perks : </p>
<p>- My new Marimba Tutorial ""Fluent Movements for Marimba.""  This tutorial is a continuation of  ""Transparent Fluidity,"" but this time is more about music than just exercises.  I realized that not everyone has my background, or even want to play classical music on marimba. So I asked Ruud Wiener to compose  pieces for my style. The result was AMAZING. !!! The tutorial will be recorded this August and will come out in September</p>
<p>- Skype Sessions: is something I started a couple of years ago. From my experience with students around the world, I can say that this is an effective way of teaching. You can choose from a few sessions, to an entire season (Sept 2016 - June 2017 four sessions a month!!)</p>
<p>  If you are not in a position to contribute, but you like my project and still would like to help somehow, please feel free to spread the word among your friends....</p>
<p> I thank you all </p>

<p>The program includes hands-on instruction with cochineal, añil, and pericon, as well as a few tree barks and fruit skins to complete the color spectrum. This residency is comprehensive program to learn the natural dyes tradition of Oaxaca including resources for a better understanding of the complex culture of Mexico and the history of its colors.</p>
<p>This is an real honour to be selected to study with natural dyers who have ancient traditional cultural knowledge of extracting colour from plants.  This opportunity will allow me to expand my current dyeing practices to create new colours and designs using different plants and techniques.  The use of plant dyes is ancient knowledge which is being lost in many places due to the introduction of synthetic dyes which tend to be brighter but much more toxic to people and the environment.  I am keen to help to preserve this knowlege by practicing and reviving natural plant dye practices.    This is my dream and will allow me to push my dyed artworks to a new level of professionalism.  The money raised goes towards tuition, accommodation, materials and airfares to Mexico.  I really appreciate any donation you can make to help me undertake this artist residency and to learn new skills and techniques to create new wearable artworks!!!  Thank you!! :)</p>

<h3>Did you know that...<br/>....there are 7 evident relationships between the Bible and the Tarot!</h3>
<p>Until today, a Tarot deck that related to the Bible, had not been made. Yet, there are many indications that confirm the link between the Arcana of the Tarot and the Holy Book of Jews and Christians:</p>
<ol>
<li>The sculptures and the stained-glass windows of Roman and Gothic churches, and the moralizing medieval texts, depict numerous imagesidentical to the Major Arcana of the Tarot; for example, cardinal and theological Virtues, Death, Angels, Devils, the Last Judgment. Not surprisingly, all the major iconologists of the twentieth century, including eminent esoterics, such as Arthur Edward Waite and Gerard Van Rijnberk, argue that the origin of Tarot is in the Christian iconography of the Middle-Ages.</li>
<li>There are 22 Major Arcana in the Tarot, like the chapters of <i>Revelation of St. John</i>. Many Arcana are, in fact, directly inspired to <i>Revelation</i>.</li>
<li>At the end of the fifteenth century, a Dominican preacher claimed that the inventor of the Tarot had used the images of the Pope, the Angels and even God to drag men into the game.</li>
<li>4. The Italian jurist Francesco Piscina in his <i>Discussion on the order of the Tarot figures</i> (Mondovì, 1565) described the unknown inventor of the Tarot as a ""good and faithful follower of the Catholic and Christian faith"". Moreover, Piscina stated that the order of 22 Triumphs shows ""many moral teachings ... to bite the bad and pestiferous habits, customary of the populace of today.""</li>
<li>The French jurist Guillaume D'Oncieu, in <i>Numeralium locorum Decas</i> (Lyon, 1584) directly linked the subdivision of the Tarot deck to Christian numerology</li>
<li>In the sixteenth and seventeenth reworking of Tarot decks, many Major Arcana still reflected the Christian traditional iconography. It was only at the end of the eighteenth century that the false belief, regarding the Egyptian or Jewish origin of the Tarot, took hold.</li>
<li>In 2008, The Diocesan Museum of Sarsina set up a Tarot exhibition by contemporary artists, entitled <i>The Devil and the Holy water</i>, curated by Prof. Antonio Paolucci, superintendent of the Vatican Museums; the catalogue also listed articles by Alejandro Jodorowski.</li>
</ol>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><u><i><strong>This Deck is particular and unique!</strong></i></u></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Author: Giordano Berti</h3>
<p>For over 40 years I have studied Tarot... and the passion for this magical game still has not left me.<br/>The vibrations of these symbolic images continue to fluctuate within me.<br/>I studied the Tarot from the historical, artistic, philosophical and divination point of view.<br/>I wrote numerous books, published worldwide, about the Tarot: nonfiction works, encyclopedias and even experiments in narrative where Tarot was the source of inspiration.<br/>On behalf of leading companies, producers of playing cards, I edited a reprint of old Tarots and I wrote the project for new Tarot decks, who were then illustrated by great contemporary artists.</p>
<p>A summary of my studies on the Tarot is in Tarotpedia website: <a href=""http://www.tarotpedia.com/wiki/Berti,_Giordano"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Berti Giordano</a></p>
<p>The current project I am involved in, is a production of <a href=""https://rinascimentoitalianartenglish.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rinascimento Italian Style Art</a>. The title is ""Prophetic Tarot of the Bible"".</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How the Prophetic Tarot of The Bible were conceived</h3>
<p>I began working on this deck in 2012, and immediately thought that the most suitable artist to illustrate it should have been Severino Baraldi.</p>
<p>Baraldi is a great Milanese artist, born in that City in 1930, and an expert both in the illustrations of ancient history, and in representing recent events. In addition, he has created various Tarot decks for an important publishing house. We also worked together to create the Tarot of Ramses (2003) and the Oracle of the Celts (2006).<br/>Baraldi was eager to collaborate with me once more, and after four years of deep reflections on historical, ethical and aesthetic topics, we can finally show this stunning deck.</p>
<p>The Prophetic Tarot of the Bible is really innovative, primarily because on each card are represented events that occurred thousands of years, but these images are set in modern times.<br/>In many cases, the card illustrations portray characters drawn from contemporary history, for example Pope Karol Wojtyla, the rapper Tupac Shakur, the Swiss doctor Albert Schweitzer, Martin Luther King, John Lennon, Sigmund Freud and others.<br/>It will be up to you to discover other more or less famous people.</p>

<h3>Contents of the Deck</h3>
<p>Because you can not summarize in 78 images a gigantic book as the Bible, I have chosen just 78 topics related to contemporary history that Baraldi has depicted with modern and dynamic scenes: for example, the tragic events such as the migrations, famines and wars, but also episodes joyful and uplifting as the return to peace, the help to the poor and oppressed, the dialogue between representatives of different religions to make the Earth a common home of all peoples.<br/>In conclusion, this deck contains a variety of teaching inspired by the Bible, but in harmony with any religion.<br/>The Prophetic Tarot of the Bible is a source of inspiration for anyone, man or woman of any nation and religion, to encounter social, work, family and affective problems.<br/>From these 78 cards, the Consultant will receive daily tips to clarify the present and to act in the best way.</p>

</div></div>","Did you know that.......there are 7 evident relationships between the Bible and the Tarot!
Until today, a Tarot deck that related to the Bible, had not been made. Yet, there are many indications that confirm the link between the Arcana of the Tarot and the Holy Book of Jews and Christians:

The sculptures and the stained-glass windows of Roman and Gothic churches, and the moralizing medieval texts, depict numerous imagesidentical to the Major Arcana of the Tarot; for example, cardinal and theological Virtues, Death, Angels, Devils, the Last Judgment. Not surprisingly, all the major iconologists of the twentieth century, including eminent esoterics, such as Arthur Edward Waite and Gerard Van Rijnberk, argue that the origin of Tarot is in the Christian iconography of the Middle-Ages.
There are 22 Major Arcana in the Tarot, like the chapters of Revelation of St. John. Many Arcana are, in fact, directly inspired to Revelation.
At the end of the fifteenth century, a Dominican preacher claimed that the inventor of the Tarot had used the images of the Pope, the Angels and even God to drag men into the game.
4. The Italian jurist Francesco Piscina in his Discussion on the order of the Tarot figures (Mondovì, 1565) described the unknown inventor of the Tarot as a ""good and faithful follower of the Catholic and Christian faith"". Moreover, Piscina stated that the order of 22 Triumphs shows ""many moral teachings ... to bite the bad and pestiferous habits, customary of the populace of today.""
The French jurist Guillaume D'Oncieu, in Numeralium locorum Decas (Lyon, 1584) directly linked the subdivision of the Tarot deck to Christian numerology
In the sixteenth and seventeenth reworking of Tarot decks, many Major Arcana still reflected the Christian traditional iconography. It was only at the end of the eighteenth century that the false belief, regarding the Egyptian or Jewish origin of the Tarot, took hold.
In 2008, The Diocesan Museum of Sarsina set up a Tarot exhibition by contemporary artists, entitled The Devil and the Holy water, curated by Prof. Antonio Paolucci, superintendent of the Vatican Museums; the catalogue also listed articles by Alejandro Jodorowski.

 
This Deck is particular and unique!
 
The Author: Giordano Berti
For over 40 years I have studied Tarot... and the passion for this magical game still has not left me.The vibrations of these symbolic images continue to fluctuate within me.I studied the Tarot from the historical, artistic, philosophical and divination point of view.I wrote numerous books, published worldwide, about the Tarot: nonfiction works, encyclopedias and even experiments in narrative where Tarot was the source of inspiration.On behalf of leading companies, producers of playing cards, I edited a reprint of old Tarots and I wrote the project for new Tarot decks, who were then illustrated by great contemporary artists.
A summary of my studies on the Tarot is in Tarotpedia website: Berti Giordano
The current project I am involved in, is a production of Rinascimento Italian Style Art. The title is ""Prophetic Tarot of the Bible"".
 

How the Prophetic Tarot of The Bible were conceived
I began working on this deck in 2012, and immediately thought that the most suitable artist to illustrate it should have been Severino Baraldi.
Baraldi is a great Milanese artist, born in that City in 1930, and an expert both in the illustrations of ancient history, and in representing recent events. In addition, he has created various Tarot decks for an important publishing house. We also worked together to create the Tarot of Ramses (2003) and the Oracle of the Celts (2006).Baraldi was eager to collaborate with me once more, and after four years of deep reflections on historical, ethical and aesthetic topics, we can finally show this stunning deck.
The Prophetic Tarot of the Bible is really innovative, primarily because on each card are represented events that occurred thousands of years, but these images are set in modern times.In many cases, the card illustrations portray characters drawn from contemporary history, for example Pope Karol Wojtyla, the rapper Tupac Shakur, the Swiss doctor Albert Schweitzer, Martin Luther King, John Lennon, Sigmund Freud and others.It will be up to you to discover other more or less famous people.

 

Contents of the Deck
Because you can not summarize in 78 images a gigantic book as the Bible, I have chosen just 78 topics related to contemporary history that Baraldi has depicted with modern and dynamic scenes: for example, the tragic events such as the migrations, famines and wars, but also episodes joyful and uplifting as the return to peace, the help to the poor and oppressed, the dialogue between representatives of different religions to make the Earth a common home of all peoples.In conclusion, this deck contains a variety of teaching inspired by the Bible, but in harmony with any religion.The Prophetic Tarot of the Bible is a source of inspiration for anyone, man or woman of any nation and religion, to encounter social, work, family and affective problems.From these 78 cards, the Consultant will receive daily tips to clarify the present and to act in the best way.

How to use these cards

More precisely, they describe an existential condition that each person is able to improve by interpreting the cards, drawn by following a divination ritual.

<p>Japan has a long tradition of woodblock printing or Ukiyo-e ranging from Katsushika Hokusai to Shiko Munakata.  Kunio Sato’s original style of woodblock prints are forthright and simple, combining rural Japan with the imaginary realms and beings of Kenji Miyazawa. Through Kunio Sato’s work, Miyazawa’s childlike passion and spirit leaps to life, turning the observer into the dreamer.</p>

<p>ご挨拶：</p>
<p>”宮沢賢治の世界ー佐藤国男木版画展”プロジェクトのニューヨーク担当島京子です。</p>
<p> 昨年の１１月に、長年のニューヨーク滞在から日本へ帰国した友達が久しぶりにNYにやってきました。その彼女と再会した時、彼女の友人である佐藤国男氏の作品を見せてくれました。その時、その作品の素朴さや力強さにとても魅かれたと同時に、懐かしさや温かさの思いが溢れ、自分が忘れかけていたとても大切なものに出会えて感動したのです。</p>
<p> この作品をぜひニューヨークの人々に観せたい、観てもらいたいと思い、この個展開催のプロジェトをその友人を含め数人で立ち上げました。</p>
<p>日本人である私たちはきっとどこかで佐藤氏の作品に触れたことがあると思います。それは学校の教科書だったり、宮沢賢治の童話の本だったりします。私たちは知らないうちに、宮沢賢治のお話の世界を、佐藤国男氏の版画を通してビジュアル化しています。それほど彼の作品は宮沢賢治の世界観を表現しているともいえるのです。</p>
<p>その宮沢賢治の精神性とは“自然とともにある”もっといえば、宇宙との調和です。人がその人らしく生きる、自然や動物、いや生きとしいけるものすべてと共存する愛の世界です。その世界をぜひ佐藤国男の版画展で観て、感じて体感してください。</p>
<p>この個展開催のプロジェクトにご支援いただけますようどうぞよろしくお願いいたします。</p>
<p>また、ぜひギャラリーに足をお運びくださいませ。お待ちしております。</p>

<p><strong>About the Artist</strong></p>
<p>Born 1952 in Hokkaido, Japan, Kunio Sato wanted to be a painter and an archaeologist in his childhood.  He studied Buddhism at college while working as a carpenter. He began woodcutting with pieces of wood he found at construction sites where he was working. Since 1987 Sato’s woodcut prints have appeared in many editions of Miyazawa’s stories.</p>
<p>Besides illustrating Miyazawa’s books, Kunio Sato has published books about the Jomon period. He also writes essays and regularly submits humorous articles to the Hokkaido Newspaper which have been anticipated and enjoyed by the people of Hokkaido for many years.</p>

Japan has a long tradition of woodblock printing or Ukiyo-e ranging from Katsushika Hokusai to Shiko Munakata.  Kunio Sato’s original style of woodblock prints are forthright and simple, combining rural Japan with the imaginary realms and beings of Kenji Miyazawa. Through Kunio Sato’s work, Miyazawa’s childlike passion and spirit leaps to life, turning the observer into the dreamer.
 
ご挨拶：
”宮沢賢治の世界ー佐藤国男木版画展”プロジェクトのニューヨーク担当島京子です。
 昨年の１１月に、長年のニューヨーク滞在から日本へ帰国した友達が久しぶりにNYにやってきました。その彼女と再会した時、彼女の友人である佐藤国男氏の作品を見せてくれました。その時、その作品の素朴さや力強さにとても魅かれたと同時に、懐かしさや温かさの思いが溢れ、自分が忘れかけていたとても大切なものに出会えて感動したのです。
 この作品をぜひニューヨークの人々に観せたい、観てもらいたいと思い、この個展開催のプロジェトをその友人を含め数人で立ち上げました。
日本人である私たちはきっとどこかで佐藤氏の作品に触れたことがあると思います。それは学校の教科書だったり、宮沢賢治の童話の本だったりします。私たちは知らないうちに、宮沢賢治のお話の世界を、佐藤国男氏の版画を通してビジュアル化しています。それほど彼の作品は宮沢賢治の世界観を表現しているともいえるのです。
その宮沢賢治の精神性とは“自然とともにある”もっといえば、宇宙との調和です。人がその人らしく生きる、自然や動物、いや生きとしいけるものすべてと共存する愛の世界です。その世界をぜひ佐藤国男の版画展で観て、感じて体感してください。
この個展開催のプロジェクトにご支援いただけますようどうぞよろしくお願いいたします。
また、ぜひギャラリーに足をお運びくださいませ。お待ちしております。


About the Artist
Born 1952 in Hokkaido, Japan, Kunio Sato wanted to be a painter and an archaeologist in his childhood.  He studied Buddhism at college while working as a carpenter. He began woodcutting with pieces of wood he found at construction sites where he was working. Since 1987 Sato’s woodcut prints have appeared in many editions of Miyazawa’s stories.
Besides illustrating Miyazawa’s books, Kunio Sato has published books about the Jomon period. He also writes essays and regularly submits humorous articles to the Hokkaido Newspaper which have been anticipated and enjoyed by the people of Hokkaido for many years.

<h3>Personal background</h3>
<p>Marcus and I were very close friends for many years and in 2016 the idea came up that it was time that we also did an artistic collaboration together. When the demons appeared to me, I showed them to him and it immediately clicked, THIS is the project we would want to do together. We began to work, write the text, him composing, me printing the demons, worked out the details, found the perfect venue which we visited together and we were both very excited. We called ourselves Demon warriors. Then he got the amazing opportunity to compose the scores for The Terror, and he had to move to London for half a year for that. We realised it was a full time job for him so we decided to postpone our show for a year. He was meant to come back to Berlin and finish this project together and eventually show it in 2018 autumn. Then he tragically passed away... A wonderful soul, way too sudden, way too soon… A few months later, as part of my mourning, I looked at the project again and decided I won’t let it get lost. With his dear family’s approval and support, I decided to finish this collaboration and bring it to life. Now with an extra layer, I look at these demons again, how they are gazing at us, we also gaze into a different, otherworldly dimension, and his yet unheard music playing, which is the language of the connection between the two worlds - and feel, instead of standing with us, gazing into there, he has switched to the other side, and I would like to believe that he will be there, looking at us, and talking to us through his music, so realising this installation would be a way to meet him once again…</p>
<p>Some wonderful people who either knew him personally or were touched by the story are helping me to realise this exhibition in memory of Marcus, for which I am tremendously thankful for.</p>
<p>That being said, sadly the original plan for funding fell through, so even though we tailored the budget to the minimum, we are still lacking the funds to make it happen. Therefore I am asking you, if you are able to, please help me realise this exhibition with a donation.</p>
<h3>Demonography</h3>
<p>The titular demons of this photo series appeared when I was working on my previous series, Symmetry. While arranging and rearranging the photos, mirroring, inversing, and pasting them together in order to find geometrical or figurative symmetries, these apparitions materialized. According to the historical vedic of tradition, demons can be observed by those whose third eye has been activated. This prompted the question: does the lens of the camera function as that third eye?</p>
<p>Historically, demons have not always been considered malevolent. To the shamanistic tribes of North America and Central Asia, they were not subject to the conventional western idea of dividing the world into good or bad. Not guided by human sensibilities, these presumed demons were seen as being oblivious to our laws, rules and ethics, just as nature itself. When deciding to make themselves known to us humans, they are said to put on a face in order for us to recognise them. We need eyes to look into, a mouth that can talk to us, ears that can listen to us. When wearing these human elements, for a moment they allow a connection between these two completely separate but equally complex worlds that exist parallel to each other.</p>
<p>Every step of my work is carried out within the analog domain. I develop the negatives, then enlarge, flatten and retouch the final prints. The photographs are large in scale; the excessive enlargement, as well as being pleasing to the eye, also helps in building a substantial sculpture, a totem to these demons, and the prints of these images are printed upon becomes the window between the two worlds, through which – from both sides – we can gaze into each other's realities.</p>
<p>This photo series is conceived as a celebration of this special moment of connection.</p>
<p>To further shape the personalities and emotional qualities of the demons, composer <strong>Marcus Fjellström</strong> gives the demons their own voice through specifically constructed compositions and soundscapes. With the added dimension of a carefully considered musical interpretation for the various demons, their identities are being clarified and made all the more relatable to our human senses.</p>
<p>In an installation setup, the demons will be mounted on the walls of the exhibition space, while sound pieces are played consecutively in a loop over loudspeakers installed behind each photograph.</p>

<p>The former Wasserspeicher in Prenzlauer Berg is an extraordinary structure, dazzling audiences with its underground arcades and aging red brick textures. Over the years, this unique place has been hosting various performances and installations of sound, light and video.</p> <p>The excellent acoustics of the space, coupled with its unique underground scenery of a circular structure, makes it a perfect venue for this particular show. As the spectator stands at the centre of the space, surrounded by the imagery and the multi-directional sound, a fully immersive atmosphere is created which in turn helps to bring the demons to life.</p>

</div></div>","Personal background
Marcus and I were very close friends for many years and in 2016 the idea came up that it was time that we also did an artistic collaboration together. When the demons appeared to me, I showed them to him and it immediately clicked, THIS is the project we would want to do together. We began to work, write the text, him composing, me printing the demons, worked out the details, found the perfect venue which we visited together and we were both very excited. We called ourselves Demon warriors. Then he got the amazing opportunity to compose the scores for The Terror, and he had to move to London for half a year for that. We realised it was a full time job for him so we decided to postpone our show for a year. He was meant to come back to Berlin and finish this project together and eventually show it in 2018 autumn. Then he tragically passed away... A wonderful soul, way too sudden, way too soon… A few months later, as part of my mourning, I looked at the project again and decided I won’t let it get lost. With his dear family’s approval and support, I decided to finish this collaboration and bring it to life. Now with an extra layer, I look at these demons again, how they are gazing at us, we also gaze into a different, otherworldly dimension, and his yet unheard music playing, which is the language of the connection between the two worlds - and feel, instead of standing with us, gazing into there, he has switched to the other side, and I would like to believe that he will be there, looking at us, and talking to us through his music, so realising this installation would be a way to meet him once again…
Some wonderful people who either knew him personally or were touched by the story are helping me to realise this exhibition in memory of Marcus, for which I am tremendously thankful for.
That being said, sadly the original plan for funding fell through, so even though we tailored the budget to the minimum, we are still lacking the funds to make it happen. Therefore I am asking you, if you are able to, please help me realise this exhibition with a donation.
Demonography
The titular demons of this photo series appeared when I was working on my previous series, Symmetry. While arranging and rearranging the photos, mirroring, inversing, and pasting them together in order to find geometrical or figurative symmetries, these apparitions materialized. According to the historical vedic of tradition, demons can be observed by those whose third eye has been activated. This prompted the question: does the lens of the camera function as that third eye?
Historically, demons have not always been considered malevolent. To the shamanistic tribes of North America and Central Asia, they were not subject to the conventional western idea of dividing the world into good or bad. Not guided by human sensibilities, these presumed demons were seen as being oblivious to our laws, rules and ethics, just as nature itself. When deciding to make themselves known to us humans, they are said to put on a face in order for us to recognise them. We need eyes to look into, a mouth that can talk to us, ears that can listen to us. When wearing these human elements, for a moment they allow a connection between these two completely separate but equally complex worlds that exist parallel to each other.
Every step of my work is carried out within the analog domain. I develop the negatives, then enlarge, flatten and retouch the final prints. The photographs are large in scale; the excessive enlargement, as well as being pleasing to the eye, also helps in building a substantial sculpture, a totem to these demons, and the prints of these images are printed upon becomes the window between the two worlds, through which – from both sides – we can gaze into each other's realities.
This photo series is conceived as a celebration of this special moment of connection.
To further shape the personalities and emotional qualities of the demons, composer Marcus Fjellström gives the demons their own voice through specifically constructed compositions and soundscapes. With the added dimension of a carefully considered musical interpretation for the various demons, their identities are being clarified and made all the more relatable to our human senses.
In an installation setup, the demons will be mounted on the walls of the exhibition space, while sound pieces are played consecutively in a loop over loudspeakers installed behind each photograph.

Venue
Small Water Reservoir in Prenzlauerberg, Berlin.

The former Wasserspeicher in Prenzlauer Berg is an extraordinary structure, dazzling audiences with its underground arcades and aging red brick textures. Over the years, this unique place has been hosting various performances and installations of sound, light and video. The excellent acoustics of the space, coupled with its unique underground scenery of a circular structure, makes it a perfect venue for this particular show. As the spectator stands at the centre of the space, surrounded by the imagery and the multi-directional sound, a fully immersive atmosphere is created which in turn helps to bring the demons to life.

<p><u><strong>About us</strong></u></p>
<p>yoyo tinz, Accra based start up, has over the years been committed to documenting, promoting and archiving the African hip hop culture. In 2018 <strong>we are celebrating our fifth year</strong>. On that occasion we wish to organise <strong>our very first festival</strong>.</p>
<p><u><strong>The Festival</strong></u></p>
<p>The yoyo tinz festival, planned for November 2018, will be two-day-physical enactments of all the work we do in highlighting hip hop culture in it's fullness - representing all the elements - r<strong>ap, graffiti, beatboxing, breakdancing, DJing, movies, photography, fashion</strong>... we have, numerous exciting and informative activities planned.</p>
<p>With a very blatant <strong>anti-bigotry, anti-racism and anti-misogyny</strong> policy - both on our digital and physical platforms - we have intended - and succeeded to a large extent - to have all our spaces be <strong>all-inclusive, and safe for marginalised</strong>, oppressed members of our society - women, queers, and other minorities. <strong>We hope for our festival to become the very first minorities friendly hip hop festival in Ghana.</strong></p>
<p>In the past, we have helped outfits like Alliance Française, Accra, organise successful hip hop festivals; and we have also consistently, for four years, had thrilling, magnificent yoyo tinz appearances at the very popular annual Chale Wote Street Art Festival in Accra; with our <strong>crowd-pulling ability</strong> increasing by the year - into thousands.</p>
<p><u><strong>Our challenges</strong></u></p>
<p>Our main <strong>challenge</strong> is that <strong>the culture is still misunderstood.</strong> Majority of hip hop artists do not benefit from support, for that reason some elements of the hip hop culture suffer and are under represented moreover, some artists themselves do not dare to fully embrace the culture.

<h2>Hi, we are studio Muho</h2>
<p>Hi, we are studio Muho and we are from Kraków, Poland. Muho is a male name of Croatian origin — apparently not a very common one. People with this name are thought to be creative and strong. We don't know if this is true, but we do like this explanation. We are designers, thinkers, artists and copywriters. And we do love nice, minimalist design.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Posters</h3>
<p>We present to you our collections of original posters. Three graphically different minimal collections – because we are all different. Ola’s favorite thing is having fun in the workshop experimenting with different designs and materials. Maria’s obsession is typographic details — the little things most people don’t even notice. Mateusz loves using photomanipulation to give images a second meaning. These posters are our way of expressing ourselves. We believe that quality matters, and that is why we want to print our designs ourselves with carefully selected printing methods and high quality paper.</p>
<p>Each poster is 70 x 100 cm and will be printed here in Kraków on nice uncoated Munken Lynx Rough 120 g paper. The Typo collection will be custom created with screenprinting — a process which allows us to use inks and textures which cannot be achieved through offset or digital printing alone. The Animals series will be digital printed, which allow for great clarity and minute detail,  and the Circle collection will be a mix of both methods.</p>
<p>We offer three distinct collections of posters. Each one represents a different designer and a different mood and our individual passion for design. Each of the nine posters tells its own story.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Circle collection</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501671432/gombpzchhwwuijz39srt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Circle collection includes three posters with different circle graphics in black and white. Two of these have metallic gold accents which bring them alive. In keeping with our minimalist aesthetic, Ola’s posters are based on circular elements and other geometric shapes combined with carefully manipulated photographic imagery in the background.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Typo collection</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501671752/d0nxefcskxqh3e8dxnp1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Typo collection contains three posters with different diacritical marks. Type is such an integral part of our daily life — we spend our days staring at screens and reading text on paper but how often do we stop to admire the character of individual letterforms? Maria’s posters elevate typography to bold minimal fashion objects which will bring beauty to your space.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Animal collection</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501671841/lqt6xeqezlhvemhzmwsb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This collection shows the connection between animals and their surroundings. Although nature photography might seem too detailed to be minimal, we have reduced these images to their most basic essence. Smooth transitions between the shapes of foreground characters and beautiful landscapes filled with trees symbolise unity with nature.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The budget we set will allow us to cover the cost of printing a minimum cost-effective amount of 70 of each of the posters. We believe that our posters fit perfectly into the home and office interior – either as one individual poster or together in a set of three as they were designed.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Are we scared?</h3>
<p>This is our first project on such a platform and we admit – as designers we are a bit shy. The success of this campaign will prove to us that our projects can bring enjoyment to someone else - not just us. But this isn’t our first time printing stuff. We've done this before and we know this is not rocket science. We hope you’ll be willing to support us in this exciting endeavor.</p>

</div></div>","Hi, we are studio Muho
Hi, we are studio Muho and we are from Kraków, Poland. Muho is a male name of Croatian origin — apparently not a very common one. People with this name are thought to be creative and strong. We don't know if this is true, but we do like this explanation. We are designers, thinkers, artists and copywriters. And we do love nice, minimalist design.

 
Posters
We present to you our collections of original posters. Three graphically different minimal collections – because we are all different. Ola’s favorite thing is having fun in the workshop experimenting with different designs and materials. Maria’s obsession is typographic details — the little things most people don’t even notice. Mateusz loves using photomanipulation to give images a second meaning. These posters are our way of expressing ourselves. We believe that quality matters, and that is why we want to print our designs ourselves with carefully selected printing methods and high quality paper.
Each poster is 70 x 100 cm and will be printed here in Kraków on nice uncoated Munken Lynx Rough 120 g paper. The Typo collection will be custom created with screenprinting — a process which allows us to use inks and textures which cannot be achieved through offset or digital printing alone. The Animals series will be digital printed, which allow for great clarity and minute detail,  and the Circle collection will be a mix of both methods.
We offer three distinct collections of posters. Each one represents a different designer and a different mood and our individual passion for design. Each of the nine posters tells its own story.
 
Circle collection

The Circle collection includes three posters with different circle graphics in black and white. Two of these have metallic gold accents which bring them alive. In keeping with our minimalist aesthetic, Ola’s posters are based on circular elements and other geometric shapes combined with carefully manipulated photographic imagery in the background.  
 
Typo collection

The Typo collection contains three posters with different diacritical marks. Type is such an integral part of our daily life — we spend our days staring at screens and reading text on paper but how often do we stop to admire the character of individual letterforms? Maria’s posters elevate typography to bold minimal fashion objects which will bring beauty to your space.   
 
Animal collection

This collection shows the connection between animals and their surroundings. Although nature photography might seem too detailed to be minimal, we have reduced these images to their most basic essence. Smooth transitions between the shapes of foreground characters and beautiful landscapes filled with trees symbolise unity with nature.
 
The budget we set will allow us to cover the cost of printing a minimum cost-effective amount of 70 of each of the posters. We believe that our posters fit perfectly into the home and office interior – either as one individual poster or together in a set of three as they were designed.

 
Are we scared?
This is our first project on such a platform and we admit – as designers we are a bit shy. The success of this campaign will prove to us that our projects can bring enjoyment to someone else - not just us. But this isn’t our first time printing stuff. We've done this before and we know this is not rocket science. We hope you’ll be willing to support us in this exciting endeavor.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

                              OUR JOURNEY
OmniRootZ Productions is a grassrootz artz mothaship organization; we currently operate WILDFIREgallery -- a hub for experimental + functional arts in Belize. 
As always, we  hold the torch for marginalized people, artists seeking new ways to experience their lives. We commit to providing a safe, creative space away from the traditional sexists, racist, homophobic and xenophobic roles hefted upon the people; we hold open the doorways to making art for folks seeking self exploration, different ways to imagine their lives and open expression... and generate EXPOSURE & INCOME...weaving visual and performance art in every project.  
 Creative collaborative efforts with artists in Belize and throughout the Americas will produce powerful, meaningful and inspirational ART that not only responds within an indigenous & diasporic post-colonial context but also nurtures and expands the cultural development of Belize.  
We aim to create a space that encourages creative dialogue in our community. 



WHAT HAVE WE DONE SO FAR???



 Our first few projects have been multi-dimensional.  We hosted a muralist- Emanuel Martinez from Denver, who designed and painted alongside villagers, a mural for Esperanza community center. Recently we produced a play and workshops with a theatre professional--Riti Satchdeva from NYC whose visit we sponsored (with the help of the US Embassy). And now, we've invited 2X National (U.S.) Champion Slam Poet Hakim Bellamy to present performance poetry workshops in our new little spot!


Earlier this year, we established an art gallery, WILDFIREgallery and Trading Post which so far has featured paintings, digital art, collage work from local artists and functional/wearable art created by local and international artisans.  WILDFIRE's vision is to expand exhibits to feature artists from all over Belize, Central America, and the U.S.  At our openings, we feature performance art --music, poetry--and very delicious local organic chocolate and wines.  


HERE'S WHERE YOU COME IN...


     
LET THE ART DO IT'S MAGIC!
$5,000 WILL SUSTAIN WILDFIRE ARTZ SPACE FOR A YEAR! Relocating represents a doable step toward generating  more art happenings in San Ignacio.  We want to encourage membership and collective ownership, as well as focus on our retail income by selling wearable and functional art.

We must allow time for folks to break out of old boxes and participate in exploring and expanding creative crossroads for Local Artists, as well as for International Artists who want to exchange energy here in Belize.    Securing the right space will give us time to build an audience and consumer base, and collaborate on events with other art organizations.  

...LET THE ART DO IT'S MAGIC.
 
WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE?        ONE YEAR.... 

$5000........to pay rent + utilities for an improved location for 1 year 


$2000........to support Imagine this... visiting artists project $ 600........to offset expenses for supplies (to round things off.pay Indiegogo)



$2400........to pay a student intern artist a stipend

The priority is to get the RENT PAID; this SUBGOAL ALLOWS US TO GET ART ON THE WALL NOW!  With YOUR support, we can have breathing room to truly shape an international grassrootz arts space grounded in Belize while we foster strong allegiances with fellow..co-conspirators, art groups or projects in San Ignacio. 

WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?...
By supporting this project, you will gain the satisfaction of strengthening linkages for art, artists and creative discourse around the world..this is the true perk; however, there's more:  check out our perks!
  
The Impact: TRANSFORMATION STATION
 If you believe in the magical wondrous, transformational powers of ART...then we need say no more!   Projects promoting creative art and community building have solid foundations & numerous models around the world; however, the appropriate alchemy for grassrootz cutting edge art projects in Belize is still brewing.

<p>Hi everyone,<br/>First of all, I would like to thank you for taking your time to read this. My name is Marija Lopac, friends call me Mare. I am an independent visual artist and curator from Croatia. I like to travel and I am trying to travel as much as I can. In one of my travels to Vietnam I got the idea of connecting Vietnamese connecting Vietnamese visual arts with Croatian. The name of the project is the Other side. We started in 2015 with the first part, which was the exhibition of one Vietnamese art collective in the museum in Zagreb, Croatia. The exhibition was very well received by the public and the cooperation will further continue with another exhibition in Croatia in the autumn 2016.<br/>The problem is that I need to make second part of the Other side project which is the exhibition of Croatian contemporary artists in Vietnam. Name of the exhibition is Memories. I am starting this campaign because I need to buy travel ticket, print catalogue and provide other necessary expenses for the exhibition. This will be the first time that Croatian group of artists exhibits their artworks in Vietnam. <br/>I truly believe in this project. I think it is important to build a bridge which connects the two countries, otherwise geographically very far away. With this project I want to show the works of the most important young contemporary Croatian artists. I already asked for funding at the Croatian cultural foundation, but they said that they do not want to finance exhibition in Vietnam. They think it is not important for Croatian culture, because Croatia does not have any economic, or diplomatic relations with Vietnam. I am frustrated about this, because I believe art is international language, and we, artists, can be above political and economic view. The plan is that the exhibition will be held in May 2016 in Vietnam. Hope I will get enough money for expenses and that this project can go on.<br/>Thank you, Kisses,<br/>Marija</p>

</h3><p>I have - for as long as I can remember - always wanted to
leave home and go on an adventure. When I was young, I used to pack a little
bundle to the end of a stick, sling it across my shoulder and tell my mother
that if one day I disappeared not to worry because I had packed provisions. When
I was eighteen, I went to walk the Compostela – a pilgrimage route starting in
France in the Camino des Arles and concluding in northern Spain. My passion for
this project was born in my youth, nurtured throughout that walk and emboldened
by ambitions.</p>
<p>This summer I will be trekking across Canada - travelling
coast to coast. This will be a solo walk that will take place for a minimum of
three months. The project will commence in Nova Scotia as I head towards the
west coast and ultimately British Columbia. The goal of this project is not necessarily
to walk across Canada but rather to take the time to enjoy and appreciate each
part of the journey. I will be camping, fishing, documenting the land and
walking while trying to stay away from major towns and cities. All that I am to
encounter will be recorded visually and will be virtually uploaded at the end
of the trip. The project is called “Remapping and Deconstructing Canada”. I
plan to turn this journey into an art performance and create a touring art show
for the following summer. </p>
<p>In order for my ambitions for this project to be brought to
fruition, I am relying on the generosity of others to fund my trip across
Canada. My love of camping has allowed me to possess the equipment and supplies
necessary for camping in short expanses of time - but for a trip of this length
I will need to update most of my equipment. Camping and hiking gear is very
expensive - especially for a university student. I would need a new backpack
that is larger in size that would not only carry my equipment but also my
camera and its gear. I would need a new sleeping bag that can withstand colder
temperatures than the one I own now since I will be starting in the spring and
most nights have the potential to drop to zero Celsius or lower. For safety, I will need to purchase a GPS Tracker that
will permit family members to view my every move online to make sure the walk
is going according to plan. To be able to recharge my camera, the GPS Tracker
and other equipment, I will need a portable solar panel that can be attached to
my backpack. Making sure my equipment is durable and harbours the
ability to last the whole trip is very important. It is crucial that my equipment
is able to last for the duration of the walk while keeping me safe at the same
time. </p>
<p>Your help would be extremely significant towards my project,
both in its quality and being able to make it achievable. Any amount would be appreciated
greatly, spent wisely and contribute to the ultimate trek of walking Canada
coast to coast. </p>

ability to last the whole trip is very important. It is crucial that my equipment
is able to last for the duration of the walk while keeping me safe at the same
time. 
Your help would be extremely significant towards my project,
both in its quality and being able to make it achievable. Any amount would be appreciated
greatly, spent wisely and contribute to the ultimate trek of walking Canada
coast to coast.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Here's a little bit about me and my campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm Kate, I'm a software developer in the metro Detroit area</li>
<li>A year ago I lost my mom to a two year battle with Esophageal Cancer - I was dreading what kinds of sympathy cards I would receive - I envisioned sappy, impersonal, generic cards that didn't really make me feel better but instead made me annoyed.  What I really needed was a laugh, big or small, to help give me some relief, comfort and happiness during a dark time.  I realized that people like me were being left out in terms of encouragement and sympathy cards, there was nothing out there that would provide comfort in a bad situation, and I realized I needed to make it!</li>
<li>This campaign is one that I have wanted to do for a few years now, I realized recently that there's no time like the present, so here I am!</li>
<li>I plan to sell my cards on Etsy and maybe local stores or artist markets in the metro Detroit area</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here are the basic things that I need to get Best Medicine Cards started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paper</li>
<li>Envelopes</li>
<li>Art supplies such as watercolors, brushes, watercolor paper, etc</li>
<li>Plastic sleeves to package cards and envelopes</li>
<li>Mailing supplies to ship cards to customers </li>
<li>Online class to digitize handwriting </li>
<li>Printing costs</li>
<li>Domain name for website</li>
</ul>
<p>I plan on offering rewards for various donation amounts, these rewards can be found on the Perks section of my campaign page.  I will follow up with contributors to determine which designs and / or custom messages they want. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please note that the minimum amount to start a campaign is $500 which is why I selected that as my goal; however I am hoping to raise just $200 - $250 to get Best Medicine Cards started! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There is really just one thing I hope Best Medicine Cards will achieve:</p>
<ul><li>Providing a laugh, a brief moment of happiness and relief to someone going through a hard time. </li></ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Luckily there aren't a lot of risks and challenges that I can foresee, however there are a few...</p>
<ul>
<li>It's possible that not a lot of people will buy these cards, but I think that's a risk with anything that someone is trying to make and share! </li>
<li>Given the handmade nature of these cards there's a strong possibility for variations between each card - although I think that adds to the special-ness of a product there's a chance that some people will not like it</li>

This campaign is one that I have wanted to do for a few years now, I realized recently that there's no time like the present, so here I am!
I plan to sell my cards on Etsy and maybe local stores or artist markets in the metro Detroit area


What I Need & What You Get
Here are the basic things that I need to get Best Medicine Cards started:

Paper
Envelopes
Art supplies such as watercolors, brushes, watercolor paper, etc
Plastic sleeves to package cards and envelopes
Mailing supplies to ship cards to customers 
Online class to digitize handwriting 
Printing costs
Domain name for website

I plan on offering rewards for various donation amounts, these rewards can be found on the Perks section of my campaign page.  I will follow up with contributors to determine which designs and / or custom messages they want. 
 
Please note that the minimum amount to start a campaign is $500 which is why I selected that as my goal; however I am hoping to raise just $200 - $250 to get Best Medicine Cards started! 

The Impact
There is really just one thing I hope Best Medicine Cards will achieve:
Providing a laugh, a brief moment of happiness and relief to someone going through a hard time. 

Risks & Challenges
Luckily there aren't a lot of risks and challenges that I can foresee, however there are a few...

It's possible that not a lot of people will buy these cards, but I think that's a risk with anything that someone is trying to make and share! 
Given the handmade nature of these cards there's a strong possibility for variations between each card - although I think that adds to the special-ness of a product there's a chance that some people will not like it

<h2><strong>The Project</strong></h2>
<p>We're frequently told that life and success are about relationships. What always strikes me is the astoundingly ephemeral and fragile interconnectedness that makes such relationships possible. It is from these contemplations that the project, Giving Voice, was formed. It is a collection of mixed media gilded paintings, to be hand-bound with a metal cover inset, made from Eastern repoussé and dimensionally patterned mokume gane.</p>
<p>This one-of-a-kind book will also take the form of a multimedia eBook, with voice overs, a soundtrack, and animations of the cover, words, and images. Your involvement will help put this story and artwork out into the world.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513209298/rwcbsyubi7ojkhide6ik.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>How You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>In order to launch Giving Voice, I have built a team to manage the technology I don't have time to learn. It takes experts to turn this work of paper and metal into an immersive multimedia experience. </p>
<p>All of the funds raised will offset the production costs of the animations, and the cost of formatting and printing the book for distribution. The total budget for this project is actually $18,000 to pay my team and print the giclee prints, print the book, and produce the ebook. (Alas, that doesn’t include paying me.)</p>
<p>Please help spread the word! I want this book to be wildly successful so that it will inspire others to cherish our ephemeral connections and tell the world about them. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What You Get</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>The Story</strong></h2>
<p>My passion for metalsmithing is derived from my obsession with ancient Egyptian art. This fascination was triggered by a fantastically unusual board game, Voice of the Mummy, given to me the Christmas I was five years old. The game consisted of a styrofoam step pyramid with squares depicting ancient hieroglyphics, jewels, and images of Tutankhamun's gold mask. An only child, I played the game endlessly by myself, meticulously moving each cardboard Egyptologist around the board. I was mesmerized by the artwork; it was unlike anything I had ever seen. No one could have guessed that a child’s board game would become a cornerstone of my artistic existence, but this event was a pivotal moment in my life.</p>
<p>This is the story many have heard, and what can be found when investigating my history as a maker. What I've less often told is the back story of the two wonderful families behind the gift. More than this incredibly significant gift, these families brought music and laughter that would shape my outlook on the world.</p>
<p>What I remember most about the mothers of the families was that these two very different but strong, elegant, warm, and self-assured lifelong friends were always so incredibly kind to me. Their passing inspired these reflections of connectedness, and influence. Without these people and seemingly ordinary events, without a profound inquisitiveness sparked by a game, there is no question that the path of my life would have been profoundly different. Life is a chain of events and connections in which if one link breaks, wonders we might never know can be lost.</p>

<h2><strong>The Project’s Timeline</strong></h2>
<p>The book’s pages were completed in 2015. The pages were photographed in 2017, and my studio assistant, Uduak Ita, has completed the editing process for half of the artwork. My animator, Steve Walker, has completed 3 of the 11 animations and has 1 more animation in the final stages. The front cover, which will become the 12th animation in the book, will take another 2 months to complete. The original manuscript will not be bound until all the digital work is complete, but this will not effect the ebook and print book’s timeline.</p>
<p>I have waited until this point in the project’s journey to ask for funding to ensure that we have enough expertise and momentum to see it through. Based on how long the digital work has taken so far, we estimate that the book will release mid summer of 2018. We're keeping our fingers crossed that it might be sooner! </p>

<p>Unless technology radically changes in the next 6 months, the multimedia ebook version will be for sale only in Apple’s iBook Store and will work only on iPads and Macs.

<h2><strong>Nice to See You Here</strong></h2>
<p>I am an artist/alchemist, obsessed with converting time into beautifully intricate objects of mystery and contemplation. Ideas synthesize through my brain at such a dizzying rate, it is impossible that only one kind of art should come out of me. I specialize in both ancient metalsmithing and illumination techniques that are laborious and intensive, demanding deep knowledge and acute skill, which counter today's impulse for immediacy. My award winning artwork ranges in scale from wearable art jewelry and hand illuminated artist books to bespoke architectural metal installations for one of the world's largest super yachts. My work has also appeared in numerous juried exhibitions, books, and magazines, including the Lark 500 series, Metalsmith, Jewelry Artist, and on Home &amp; Garden Television. I created the metals program and served as head of the Metalsmithing Department at Spruill Center for the Arts, Atlanta and was an adjunct professor at the University of Tennessee. My instructional DVD and book series, Metal Techniques of Bronze Age Masters, featuring the titles Russian Filigree, Rings, All Chained Up, Eastern Repoussé and Chasing, and my iPhone™ app, iMakeJewelry have sold throughout the world.</p>

</div></div>","The Project
We're frequently told that life and success are about relationships. What always strikes me is the astoundingly ephemeral and fragile interconnectedness that makes such relationships possible. It is from these contemplations that the project, Giving Voice, was formed. It is a collection of mixed media gilded paintings, to be hand-bound with a metal cover inset, made from Eastern repoussé and dimensionally patterned mokume gane.
This one-of-a-kind book will also take the form of a multimedia eBook, with voice overs, a soundtrack, and animations of the cover, words, and images. Your involvement will help put this story and artwork out into the world.

 
How You Can Help
In order to launch Giving Voice, I have built a team to manage the technology I don't have time to learn. It takes experts to turn this work of paper and metal into an immersive multimedia experience. 
All of the funds raised will offset the production costs of the animations, and the cost of formatting and printing the book for distribution. The total budget for this project is actually $18,000 to pay my team and print the giclee prints, print the book, and produce the ebook. (Alas, that doesn’t include paying me.)
Please help spread the word! I want this book to be wildly successful so that it will inspire others to cherish our ephemeral connections and tell the world about them. 
 
What You Get
For helping me put this story and project out into the world, you will receive giclee prints, a signed print book, or a signed limited edition version of the print book, depending on your level of contribution. That is in addition to my absolute, undying gratitude that you believe in my artwork enough to help midwife its debut.

Sobo Bade is a Holiday resort, right at the seaside and what is very special about this resort is that the center piece is a amphitheatre, where international dance/ music performances take place. It connects the local artists to international artists and attracts tourists as well as inhabitants. Gerard Chenet founded, planned and built this place. When i saw this beautiful place at first i was fascinated by the concept and how everything fits so nicely together. I like the idea that the arts in this case are influencing the life and day by day of many people, the inhabitants- the people passing by or staying there for a few days, that get a deep impression by having the chance to get into direct and often times personal contact with the artists. Also international artists bringing a sense and taste of the world to the village.  </p><p>Here´s a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNneGPMdPkg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">video</a> about the project in Sobo Bade: </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/BNneGPMdPkg?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p>The architectural appearance seemed to me like an experimental collaboration of Gaudi, Hundertwasser and Disneyland.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The goal is to create enamel pins representing some of my favorite military aircraft.</p>
<p>The first in this series is dedicated to the C-17 Globemaster III, more affectionately known as the “Moose” by those who fly and care for this majestic aircraft. My initial designs represent the C-17 based in Charleston, SC. As a native South Carolinian, this aircraft has held my attention for many years.<br/> </p>
<h3>The Designs</h3>
<p>There are <i>two</i> initial pin designs.  The first is a caricature-like side profile of the aircraft. There are limitations to the level of detail allowed (no text on the tail, for instance).  Because of that, I decided to create a tail flash that complements the first pin design.  Both designs were digitally drawn in Adobe Illustrator by me with references made with my own photographs. This fund raising campaign is to kick-off these two designs which will then help fund future pins.<br/> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here is what you'll get for backing this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>High quality enamel pin(s) with rubber back.</li>
<li>Free shipping to the US for up to two pins! Ordering more will incur a small shipping surcharge.</li>
<li>International customers, I’ve tried to keep the shipping costs low for you.</li>
<li>Appreciation of supporting an independent artist and photographer!<br/> </li>
</ul>
<p>What your money goes towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost of manufacturing 100 limited edition of each pin design</li>
<li>Printed Card stock for mounting pins</li>
<li>Fulfillment labor</li>
<li>Packaging materials</li>
<li>Postage</li>
<li>Indiegogo &amp; credit card processing fees<br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Anyone who knows me will certainly agree that this is a passion project. It began as a desire to decorate my camera bag with something unique and fitting of military aviation. The craze over #pingame on Instagram inspired me to take it to a bigger scale. With your support, I intend to re-invest in creating more pins if my goal is surpassed.   <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I'll be 100% upfront – this is my first attempt at anything of this scale. If I reach my initial goal, I'll have enough money to manufacture and fulfill 200 pins. I've carefully considered my stretch goals to reflect the additional cost of manufacturing and fulfillment of new designs.<br/> </p>

<strong>Mid-October</strong>: Campaign starts!</li>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't afford a pin right now, that's okay! But maybe you'd be willing to help share word about these pins throughout the aviation community by sharing the campaign on social media? That would be greatly appreciated!</p>
</div></div>","Overview
The goal is to create enamel pins representing some of my favorite military aircraft.
The first in this series is dedicated to the C-17 Globemaster III, more affectionately known as the “Moose” by those who fly and care for this majestic aircraft. My initial designs represent the C-17 based in Charleston, SC. As a native South Carolinian, this aircraft has held my attention for many years. 
The Designs
There are two initial pin designs.  The first is a caricature-like side profile of the aircraft. There are limitations to the level of detail allowed (no text on the tail, for instance).  Because of that, I decided to create a tail flash that complements the first pin design.  Both designs were digitally drawn in Adobe Illustrator by me with references made with my own photographs. This fund raising campaign is to kick-off these two designs which will then help fund future pins. 

What We Need & What You Get
Here is what you'll get for backing this project:

High quality enamel pin(s) with rubber back.
Free shipping to the US for up to two pins! Ordering more will incur a small shipping surcharge.
International customers, I’ve tried to keep the shipping costs low for you.
Appreciation of supporting an independent artist and photographer! 

What your money goes towards:

Cost of manufacturing 100 limited edition of each pin design
Printed Card stock for mounting pins
Fulfillment labor
Packaging materials
Postage
Indiegogo & credit card processing fees 


The Impact

If you don't have a car (and hardly anyone does) You can go to the neighbouring towns by motorcycle taxi which is dangerous and expensive, on the back of a truck with whatever livestock or goods might crush you. You can go in a car with 8 or 10 of you in a five seater which is dangerous, sweaty and uncomfortable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pader is in the north of
Uganda, it is a very poor community, the average wage is less than $1.50 per day. There is currently no transport service during
the day for a town of 15,000 people.  We believe
this is restricting communities ability to generate trade and wealth and to
sustainably support their families.</p>
<p>So we want to help Pader grow
commercially – which we believe will have a developmental ripple effect across the town and which will allow people in Pader reach better services such as hospitals and clinics in the towns and cities.</p>

These minibuses are the lifeblood of transportation in East Africa and are easily repaired in Uganda. They are also rugged and reliable.</p>
<p>In return for the support we will plaster your name on the van. The more you give the bigger your name will be and you will achieve fame and notoriety in rural Africa.

<h3>What Reliable Transport Means</h3>
<div>Imagine not being able to get good medical care or drugs when you or your child is sick. Imagining waiting weeks or months for a vital part or tool to arrive so you can continue your business. Reliable transport means you are connected to the world and you are able to take advantage of opportunities afforded by access to larger towns and cities. It means you can see friends and family more often and travel onwards to places such as Kampala or Juba. You can choose to start businesses using materials or tools which were previously unavailable to you. Extra educational possibilities open up for your children and its easier to find qualified employees and employers if they can reach you easily.</div>

<p>We are launching this campaign to fund five new and inclusive opportunities for recent graduates. Funds raised will go directly to the beneficiaries, to develop their expertise and increase their confidence. They will be paid fairly for their work and strongly encouraged to contribute to a field that might otherwise seem exclusive and closed.</p>
<p>There is often a lack of support for young art graduates today, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Our concern is that this will mean a level of exclusion from the cultural sector that is unacceptable. We need your help to do something positive! Please support our campaign to create new opportunities for recent graduates. </p>

</div></div>","Please Support our Campaign

 

We are launching this campaign to fund five new and inclusive opportunities for recent graduates. Funds raised will go directly to the beneficiaries, to develop their expertise and increase their confidence. They will be paid fairly for their work and strongly encouraged to contribute to a field that might otherwise seem exclusive and closed.
There is often a lack of support for young art graduates today, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Our concern is that this will mean a level of exclusion from the cultural sector that is unacceptable. We need your help to do something positive! Please support our campaign to create new opportunities for recent graduates. 




Our 'Subscription' pledge includes forthcoming issues of Afterall journal in print and e-book editions, plus access to the online archive of all back issues.

How Will Contributing Make a Difference?


Success can often be traced back to key opportunities that encourage young graduates to persist in their chosen field. 
Your contribution will directly benefit graduates from underrepresented backgrounds or
who are the first in their family to have gone on to higher education. The opportunities will be funded as follows:
  One twelve-month part-time research placement in the Afterall office at Central Saint Martins (£10,000) Four three-month research and writing bursaries overseen by Afterall editors at Central Saint Martins (£2,500 each) 
Any funds raised above our target will go towards creating additional bursaries for recent graduates committed to working in contemporary art research and writing.





A canvas tote bag containing five One Work or Exhibition Histories titles of your choice. A full list of titles in these series can be found on our website.



Why Contribute Now?Over the next 30 days we ask you to pledge whatever you can afford and in return we will raid our archives so that we can offer something in return.

<br/>
<p>Attraverso i fondi reperiti, siamo riusciti nel giugno 2014 a dare vita
alla prima edizione di <i>Enziteto Real Estate</i> che ha ospitato
artisti del calibro di <i>Alberonero, Alfano, Ciredz, Geometric Bang e
Tellas</i>. Le opere tuttora visibili, sono state eseguite a San Pio, quartiere
periferico del capoluogo pugliese, ancora oggi chiamato dai suoi
abitanti come “Enziteto”. </p>
<p>La seconda edizione (<b>Bari Real Estate 2015</b>) prevede un’estensione del
progetto tale da creare un legame ancora più forte fra San Pio e il cuore di
Bari, facendo così del quartiere Libertà un nuovo punto focale dell’evento.</p>
<p>La scelta territoriale è ua fattore determinante per lo sviluppo del
progetto stesso. </p>
<p>Il nostro interesse è rivolto a coinvolgere chi è meno abituato a
confrontarsi con graffiti, street art e arte in genere, <b>puntando alle periferie</b> e alle aree solitamente considerate prive
di attenzione nelle nostre città. In tal modo i quartieri decentrati assumono
nuove potenzialità culturali, sociali ed economiche offerte dalla
partecipazione degli abitanti, degli artisti e dei visitatori alle iniziative
preposte. Inoltre, le opere realizzate sono da considerarsi integrate alle
strutture e ai quartieri selezionati, quindi come valorizzazione del patrimonio
territoriale.</p>
<p>Per raggiungere questo obiettivo è necessario <b>coinvolgere attivamente i residenti nei processi creativi</b>. Solo in
questo modo un’opera d’arte potrà dirsi veramente pubblica, poiché risultato di
un’autentica mediazione fra gli artisti e il contesto nel quale intervengono. Un’arte
urbana che non tradisca la propria natura d’arte proveniente “dal basso<span>” che si oppone alle logiche espositive orientate
“dall’alto”. Non èil frutto di una direzione artistica prestabilita ma
un arricchirsi reciproco tra l’artista e il cittadino, attraverso la loro
interazione costante e la conoscenza del territorio.</span></p>

L’arte può esser vissuta quotidianamente,
osservata, contemplata e immaginata.<br/><br/><br/>

<h3 style=""color: #0099cc;"">Il Nome<br/>
</h3> <p><b><i>Bari Real Estate 2015</i></b> è un contenitore di proposte,
idee e programmi a medio e lungo termine.<span> 
Con questo <i>concept</i>, invitiamo
a guardare in maniera diversa le periferie delle nostre città, non senza un
tocco di ironia, leggerezza e spensieratezza.  </span>
<i>Estate </i>è una parola che, in inglese, può avere molti
significati: si pronuncia <i>esteit</i>, e
può significare eredità, tenuta di lusso, ma anche ceto sociale. <i>Real Estate
</i>è solitamente usato per indicare la messa in vendita di un complesso
abitativo signorile o di villeggiatura. In lingua italiana il termine rimanda
alla stagione vacanziera dell’anno.  L’idea, paradossale e sarcastica, è che un
quartiere popolare e in difficoltà possa per un attimo essere pensato e vissuto come un “real estate”.</p>

</h3> <p></p>
<p>Lo scorso anno, a San Pio, l’obiettivo principale era quello di attirare l’interesse
di media e cittadini verso un quartiere dimenticato, <b>invertendo la rotta periferia-centro</b>. Attraverso l’<b>impatto
mediatico internazionale </b>che ne è derivato si è prodotto un flusso di
visitatori attratti dalle opere e da una rassegna stampa importante,
contribuendo a demolire almeno un po’ l’associazione che l’immaginario
collettivo è solito compiere tra il quartiere e la criminalità. </p>
<p><b>Bari Real
Estate 2015</b> racchiude un’espansione di obiettivi e finalità
mirate ad attraversare più aree della città, stimolando interazioni locali,
nazionali e internazionali.<span>  Quest’edizione
rappresenta una rete cross-culturale che scioglie i confini urbani, liberando
le visioni estetiche e sociali ormai del tutto stereotipate. </span></p>

<br/><br/><br/> </div> <div style=""text-align: justify;""> <h3 style=""color: #0099cc;"">Due Quartieri<br/>
</h3> <p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I due quartieri hanno nelle loro costituzioni quasi
opposte dei punti in comune dai quali far partire la nostra ricerca.</p>
<p><b>San Pio</b>, così
ribattezzato dall’amministrazione una decina di anni fa, è un complesso di case
popolari costruite negli anni ’50 in un’area isolata a nord della città, dove tutte
le avanguardistiche strutture pubbliche pensate per il suo auto sostentamento
non furono mai messe in funzione, creando sin dalla sua nascita i presupposti
per una vera e propria ghettizzazione. I tremila abitanti dispongono di un solo
bar, un solo bus, un solo supermercato e un dispensario di medicine. </p>
<p><b>I casi di
criminalità e disagio estremo tardano ad abbandonare San Pio</b>: non
esteso né popoloso come Scampia a Napoli o lo Zen a Palermo, il quartiere
rimane comunque comunemente associato a questi ultimi per problemi analoghi. <br/></p>
<p>Il <b>quartiere
Libertà</b>, con 60mila abitanti, è il più popoloso di Bari. A differenza di
San Pio, il Libertà è situato a immediato ridosso del centro cittadino e si fa
subito notare per la sua edilizia storicamente rilevante, fitta di palazzi
costruiti durante la prima metà del Novecento. Durante gli ultimi decenni il
quartiere è divenuto oggetto di un crescente degrado e disinteresse delle
istituzioni.</p>
<p>La crisi economica ha rafforzato <b>l’animo popolare</b> del cuore abitativo
del capoluogo: se da un lato si assiste alla chiusura dei negozi storici di Via
Manzoni, dall’altro si vede l’aumento di studenti e giovani lavoratori in cerca
di alloggi a buon prezzo. </p>
<p>Per la stessa ragione, sono attirati nel quartiere
immigrati provenienti dall’Africa centrale e da tutta l’area asiatica.
Talvolta, questi ultimi vengono costretti a piegarsi alle <b>logiche dell’illegalità</b> che non hanno mai lasciato le strade del quartiere.</p>
<p>La cronaca parla spesso di “una terra di nessuno”, teatro
di episodi drammatici di criminalità organizzata che ne fanno <b>una sorta di periferia nel cuore di Bari</b>
dove i clan si spartiscono le aree di spaccio e il controllo dei traffici. A
pagare il prezzo più alto di tutto questo, come sempre, sono i più giovani,
specie quelli che cedono al fascino della vita criminale.</p>

Certamente l’arte non può ambire a risolvere i
problemi più seri di un quartiere in difficoltà eppure il suo contributo può essere
essenziale e la sua presenza un <b>incentivo per i cittadini baresi a trovare
o a ritrovare l’interesse per San Pio e per il Libertà</b>: recarvisi significa
vedere e sentire l’energia con cui si esprime la <b>forte volontà di riscatto
dei residenti</b>, tanto più quando veicolata attraverso <b>attività
creative</b>, come quelle encomiabili promosse dall’Accademia del Cinema e
dall’Officina degli Esordi.<br/><br/><br/>
</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<h3 style=""color: #0099cc;"">Il Progetto<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>Non si tratterà di un semplice intervento di <b>ri-estetizzazione
urbana</b>: Pigment e gli artisti invitati <b>coinvolgeranno attivamente i
residenti dei quartieri, a partire da quelli più giovani, nelle loro attività
artistiche</b>. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Come?</p>
<p>Un <b>corso di graffiti e arti urbane gratuito</b> a
cura di Pigment è già attivo, dal giorno 18 aprile 2015 grazie al sostegno
dell’<b>Accademia del Cinema dei Ragazzi di Enziteto. </b><span>Nel quartiere Libertà, il corso sarà avviato
mercoledì 27 maggio 2015 grazie al supporto <b>dell’Officina degli Esordi</b>.</span></p>
<p>Con i nostri studenti under 16 scenderemo fra le
loro strade, esploreremo i luoghi che non conosciamo e inviteremo porta a porta
tutti gli abitanti a partecipare ai <b>due
incontri di quartiere </b>di metà giugno.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432042770/yzhnufjzgnpzj3jdsuth.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 127.859px; height: 286px;""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/></p>
<p>A San Pio una lunga giornata di festa accoglierà
l’arrivo dei primi due artisti. Una <b>graffiti
Jam</b> colorerà le pareti esterne dello Stadio, da anni oggetto di incuria; a
seguire, all’interno dell’Accademia del Cinema di Enziteto, sarà presentato il
progetto <b><i>Bari Real Estate 2015</i></b> con video e musica dal vivo.</p>
<p>Il quartiere Libertà, con il sostegno di <b>Pophub</b> (<a href=""http://www.pophub.it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.pophub.it</a>) e dell’Amiu, vedrà l’apertura straordinaria dell’ex<b> Arena Moderno</b>, un cinema all’aperto
che per anni ha ospitato generazioni di cinefili. Rimetteremo in sesto un luogo
d’incontro abbandonato da tempo; cittadini e artisti disegneranno insieme su
supporti che, successivamente, verranno esposti nelle strade limistrofe.</p>
<p>Ad aiutarci ci saranno anche i ragazzi di <b>Metriquali</b> (<a href=""http://www.metriquali.it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.metriquali.it</a>), pronti ad attivare
sistemi di recupero degli spazi in disuso tramite l’autocostruzione
partecipata, con artisti e cittadini.</p>
<p>I primi due artisti si occuperanno di <b>colorare due grandi pareti</b> delle case
popolari di Enziteto e dell’Officina degli Esordi. </p>
<p>Entro settembre saranno <b>almeno tre</b> gli <b>interventi
pubblici</b> di grandi dimensioni. Nostro obiettivo è raccogliere più fondi
possibili per poter così ampliare il programma e ospitare un maggior numero di artisti.</p>

A fine settembre l’Officina degli Esordi ospiterà
una<b> mostra</b> a cura di Pigment

su carta e tessuto realizzate.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>Cosa sta già accadendo

</p>
<p>Hi everyone! We are Pigment Workroom, and Bari Real Estate 2015 is a participatory urban art project we want to
fulfill. That’s why we are asking for your support. </p>
<p>Ours is a DIY art-printing studio: we build it
up in 2014 thanks to a win at a couple of national calls-for-funding. In June
2014 we realized Enziteto Real Estate’s first edition: Italian artists
Alberonero, Alfano, Ciredz, Geometric Bang and Tellas worked in San Pio, a
suburban neighborhood of Bari, still known among its residents with its old
name, “Enziteto”. </p>
<p>At the same time we have built our laboratory
piece by piece. There, artists handprint their silkscreen artworks on paper and
t-shirts (and this is, for the most part, what we would love to give you in
return for your precious help).</p>
<p>Our mission addresses to people not used to cultural
and artistic initiatives, for instance the residents of popular and suburban
neighborhoods: graffiti and so-called “street art” can, at certain conditions,
embody a way of aestheticization of human territories otherwise treated as
non-places by politics and public administrations.</p>
The very first condition in
order to fulfill this purpose is that residents shall be involved in the whole
creative processes. That’s the only way to make art truly “public”, the result
of mediation between the artists and the context in which they intervene. Urban
art’s nature is grassroots: it is not something that one imposes upon a
community like, for instance, a commercial billboard. It’s not a hit-and-run, nor
the result of a preset artistic direction: it is rather a mutual enrichment
between the artist and the citizen, a result that can only be achieved through
their interaction and the knowledge of the territory.<br/><br/><p></p>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""> <h3 style=""color: #cc6666;"">Mission</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>The event’s first edition aimed to attract
media and citizens’ attention towards a forgotten neighborhood and that’s what
we succeeded to obtain: reversing the “first downtown, then suburbs” logic, and
generating international media impact. Enziteto Real Estate induced a
remarkable flux of visitors thanks to the appeal of the murals, as well as a
huge media coverage: this contributed to demolish a little bit the association
between the neighborhood and criminality which is still deep-rooted in the
collective consciousness. </p>
<p>The title we chose for the project aims to this
precise target, not without a certain irony. In English, the word Estate has
more than one meaning: heritage, a luxury property or even social class. Real
Estate is usually employed to mean a high-class residence for sale. In Italian,
Estate means summer. </p>
The sarcastic idea that a
suburban neighborhood could, even just for a moment, be imagined as a “real
estate” or a luxury residence for a summer vacation, is a way to invite people
to look differently to these types of districts. Our mission for the second
edition is to create an even stronger bond between San Pio and Bari downtown,
this time by implicating Libertà’s district.
<br/><br/><br/>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""> <h3 style=""color: #cc6666;"">Two Neighborhoods</h3>
<p>San Pio and Libertà are utterly dissimilar from
a mere aesthetic standpoint. Nevertheless, they have quite a lot of common
ground.</p>
<p>San Pio (thus renamed around ten years ago) is
a complex of social housing buildings erected during the 1950s in an isolated
area, located up north of the city, devoid of fundamental public structures and
commercial activities. Ever since then, San Pio is a sort of ghetto: its 3,000
inhabitants only have one coffee shop, one bus line, and one supermarket. Not
even a true drugstore. Criminal rates and social disadvantage are still a fact.
</p>
<p>Libertà is, on the other hand, the most
populous district of Bari, counting around 60,000 inhabitants. In contrast with
San Pio, this neighborhood is located right next to downtown and is
architecturally relevant: the most part of its buildings has been erected
during the first half of 1900, even though today it undergoes an increasing
neglect and a lack of interest from the institutions. Financial crisis led to a
drop of rental fares, thus leading to an increase of young and immigrant
population and improving the “popular soul” of this neighborhood. However,
Libertà is often a scene of criminal acts, a “no-man’s land” where gangs fight
for the control of the streets and the drug trade.</p>
<p>Art cannot be charged with responsibilities
that should rather be of administrations and politics, like solving all by
itself problems such as those of San Pio and Libertà. Anyway, its presence can
certainly play an important role in transforming viewpoints and triggering
changes. Our mission is to reactivate the attention and the interest of Bari’s
citizens for these two neighborhoods: visiting San Pio and Libertà would mean
seeing and feeling the longing for social recognition of their residents, and
their energy and commitment when involved in creative activities.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>It won’t be a plain and simple intervention of

activities.</p>
<p>How will we do so?</p>
<p>A graffiti and urban art free workshop curated
by Pigment has already been activated on April 18 in San Pio. Starting mid-May
there will be one in Libertà as well. </p>
<p>We will go on the streets with our under-16
students to explore places we don’t know yet, then we will invite each resident
to take part in two events that will occur mid-June: </p>
<p>In San Pio, the first two invited artists will
paint the outside walls of the local stadium, then a party will start at the
Cinema Academy with film screening and live music.</p>
<p>In Libertà we will re-activate for a day a
former open-air theater named “Arena Moderno”: artists and residents will paint
together, then their artworks will be part of an exhibition located in the
streets nearby the theater. </p>
Before September, the
invited artists will also paint two huge walls in San Pio and Libertà, and at
the end of the month we will organize a closing party with a live concert, the
screening of all the documentary material and an exhibition with each artwork
and apparel produced by the artists in our studio.

<p>
</p>
<p>In order to support this project, Pigment will
produce silk-screen limited-edition prints and Risograph limited edition
prints, made by the invited artists, each one of them numbered and signed. We
will also produce apparel, editorial items and gadgets. All of these items will
be given as rewards at -20% of their actual market value: your help is
fundamental for us in order to support the whole production cost of the
project, which includes travels, food and housing for the artists,
communication and materials.</p>
It’s quite simple: the more
funds we raise, the more artists will come to Bari and the more walls will be
painted in San Pio and Libertà. So, help us and share this page as much as
possible! And don’t hesitate to be in touch with us if you want to be our
sponsor.

</div></div>","L’associazione culturale Pigment
Workroom è all’opera, insieme agli artisti italiani Dem (www.demdemonio.com), Lauda (www.graffdonuts.com/graffdonuts-meets-lauda), Soap The Wizard (www.soapthewizard.it) e Alfano (www.alfanoalfano.com), per realizzare Bari Real Estate
2015, il nuovo
progetto di arte urbana partecipata che necessita del vostro aiuto per potersi
concretizzare. 


Le
nostre attività hanno principalmente sede all’interno del laboratorio di stampa
artistica artigianale a Bari in Via Imperatore Traiano 38, nato con la vincita
del bando della Regione Puglia “Principi
Attivi 2012” e di “Culturability
2013” promosso dalla Fondazione Unipolis.



Attraverso i fondi reperiti, siamo riusciti nel giugno 2014 a dare vita
alla prima edizione di Enziteto Real Estate che ha ospitato
artisti del calibro di Alberonero, Alfano, Ciredz, Geometric Bang e
Tellas. Le opere tuttora visibili, sono state eseguite a San Pio, quartiere
periferico del capoluogo pugliese, ancora oggi chiamato dai suoi
abitanti come “Enziteto”. 
La seconda edizione (Bari Real Estate 2015) prevede un’estensione del
progetto tale da creare un legame ancora più forte fra San Pio e il cuore di
Bari, facendo così del quartiere Libertà un nuovo punto focale dell’evento.
La scelta territoriale è ua fattore determinante per lo sviluppo del
progetto stesso. 
Il nostro interesse è rivolto a coinvolgere chi è meno abituato a
confrontarsi con graffiti, street art e arte in genere, puntando alle periferie e alle aree solitamente considerate prive
di attenzione nelle nostre città. In tal modo i quartieri decentrati assumono
nuove potenzialità culturali, sociali ed economiche offerte dalla
partecipazione degli abitanti, degli artisti e dei visitatori alle iniziative
preposte. Inoltre, le opere realizzate sono da considerarsi integrate alle
strutture e ai quartieri selezionati, quindi come valorizzazione del patrimonio
territoriale.
Per raggiungere questo obiettivo è necessario coinvolgere attivamente i residenti nei processi creativi. Solo in
questo modo un’opera d’arte potrà dirsi veramente pubblica, poiché risultato di
un’autentica mediazione fra gli artisti e il contesto nel quale intervengono. Un’arte
urbana che non tradisca la propria natura d’arte proveniente “dal basso” che si oppone alle logiche espositive orientate
“dall’alto”. Non èil frutto di una direzione artistica prestabilita ma
un arricchirsi reciproco tra l’artista e il cittadino, attraverso la loro
interazione costante e la conoscenza del territorio.

L’arte può esser vissuta quotidianamente,
osservata, contemplata e immaginata.

Il Nome
 Bari Real Estate 2015 è un contenitore di proposte,
idee e programmi a medio e lungo termine. 
Con questo concept, invitiamo
a guardare in maniera diversa le periferie delle nostre città, non senza un
tocco di ironia, leggerezza e spensieratezza.  
Estate è una parola che, in inglese, può avere molti
significati: si pronuncia esteit, e
può significare eredità, tenuta di lusso, ma anche ceto sociale. Real Estate
è solitamente usato per indicare la messa in vendita di un complesso
abitativo signorile o di villeggiatura. In lingua italiana il termine rimanda
alla stagione vacanziera dell’anno.  L’idea, paradossale e sarcastica, è che un
quartiere popolare e in difficoltà possa per un attimo essere pensato e vissuto come un “real estate”.

Mission
 
Lo scorso anno, a San Pio, l’obiettivo principale era quello di attirare l’interesse
di media e cittadini verso un quartiere dimenticato, invertendo la rotta periferia-centro. Attraverso l’impatto
mediatico internazionale che ne è derivato si è prodotto un flusso di
visitatori attratti dalle opere e da una rassegna stampa importante,
contribuendo a demolire almeno un po’ l’associazione che l’immaginario
collettivo è solito compiere tra il quartiere e la criminalità. 
Bari Real
Estate 2015 racchiude un’espansione di obiettivi e finalità
mirate ad attraversare più aree della città, stimolando interazioni locali,
nazionali e internazionali.  Quest’edizione
rappresenta una rete cross-culturale che scioglie i confini urbani, liberando
le visioni estetiche e sociali ormai del tutto stereotipate. 

Pigment WR si avvarrà del supporto dell’Accademia del Cinema dei Ragazzi di
Enziteto (www.getcinema.it/accademia.html)e dell’Officina degli Esordi (www.officinadegliesordi.it), nostri partner ufficiali, spazi multiculturali
che condividono gli intenti sociali con cui si può giungere al riutilizzo e
alla decorazione di spazi rimasti per anni in stato di abbandono e degrado.Le Nostre Ricompense (#1 - Lauda)

   Due Quartieri
  
I due quartieri hanno nelle loro costituzioni quasi
opposte dei punti in comune dai quali far partire la nostra ricerca.
San Pio, così
ribattezzato dall’amministrazione una decina di anni fa, è un complesso di case
popolari costruite negli anni ’50 in un’area isolata a nord della città, dove tutte
le avanguardistiche strutture pubbliche pensate per il suo auto sostentamento
non furono mai messe in funzione, creando sin dalla sua nascita i presupposti
per una vera e propria ghettizzazione. I tremila abitanti dispongono di un solo
bar, un solo bus, un solo supermercato e un dispensario di medicine. 
I casi di
criminalità e disagio estremo tardano ad abbandonare San Pio: non
esteso né popoloso come Scampia a Napoli o lo Zen a Palermo, il quartiere
rimane comunque comunemente associato a questi ultimi per problemi analoghi. 
Il quartiere
Libertà, con 60mila abitanti, è il più popoloso di Bari. A differenza di
San Pio, il Libertà è situato a immediato ridosso del centro cittadino e si fa
subito notare per la sua edilizia storicamente rilevante, fitta di palazzi
costruiti durante la prima metà del Novecento. Durante gli ultimi decenni il
quartiere è divenuto oggetto di un crescente degrado e disinteresse delle
istituzioni.
La crisi economica ha rafforzato l’animo popolare del cuore abitativo
del capoluogo: se da un lato si assiste alla chiusura dei negozi storici di Via
Manzoni, dall’altro si vede l’aumento di studenti e giovani lavoratori in cerca
di alloggi a buon prezzo. 
Per la stessa ragione, sono attirati nel quartiere
immigrati provenienti dall’Africa centrale e da tutta l’area asiatica.
Talvolta, questi ultimi vengono costretti a piegarsi alle logiche dell’illegalità che non hanno mai lasciato le strade del quartiere.
La cronaca parla spesso di “una terra di nessuno”, teatro
di episodi drammatici di criminalità organizzata che ne fanno una sorta di periferia nel cuore di Bari
dove i clan si spartiscono le aree di spaccio e il controllo dei traffici. A
pagare il prezzo più alto di tutto questo, come sempre, sono i più giovani,
specie quelli che cedono al fascino della vita criminale.

Certamente l’arte non può ambire a risolvere i
problemi più seri di un quartiere in difficoltà eppure il suo contributo può essere
essenziale e la sua presenza un incentivo per i cittadini baresi a trovare
o a ritrovare l’interesse per San Pio e per il Libertà: recarvisi significa
vedere e sentire l’energia con cui si esprime la forte volontà di riscatto
dei residenti, tanto più quando veicolata attraverso attività
creative, come quelle encomiabili promosse dall’Accademia del Cinema e
dall’Officina degli Esordi.

Il Progetto
 
Non si tratterà di un semplice intervento di ri-estetizzazione
urbana: Pigment e gli artisti invitati coinvolgeranno attivamente i
residenti dei quartieri, a partire da quelli più giovani, nelle loro attività
artistiche. 

Come?
Un corso di graffiti e arti urbane gratuito a
cura di Pigment è già attivo, dal giorno 18 aprile 2015 grazie al sostegno
dell’Accademia del Cinema dei Ragazzi di Enziteto. Nel quartiere Libertà, il corso sarà avviato
mercoledì 27 maggio 2015 grazie al supporto dell’Officina degli Esordi.
Con i nostri studenti under 16 scenderemo fra le
loro strade, esploreremo i luoghi che non conosciamo e inviteremo porta a porta
tutti gli abitanti a partecipare ai due
incontri di quartiere di metà giugno.





A San Pio una lunga giornata di festa accoglierà
l’arrivo dei primi due artisti. Una graffiti
Jam colorerà le pareti esterne dello Stadio, da anni oggetto di incuria; a
seguire, all’interno dell’Accademia del Cinema di Enziteto, sarà presentato il
progetto Bari Real Estate 2015 con video e musica dal vivo.
Il quartiere Libertà, con il sostegno di Pophub (www.pophub.it) e dell’Amiu, vedrà l’apertura straordinaria dell’ex Arena Moderno, un cinema all’aperto
che per anni ha ospitato generazioni di cinefili. Rimetteremo in sesto un luogo
d’incontro abbandonato da tempo; cittadini e artisti disegneranno insieme su
supporti che, successivamente, verranno esposti nelle strade limistrofe.
Ad aiutarci ci saranno anche i ragazzi di Metriquali (www.metriquali.it), pronti ad attivare
sistemi di recupero degli spazi in disuso tramite l’autocostruzione
partecipata, con artisti e cittadini.
I primi due artisti si occuperanno di colorare due grandi pareti delle case
popolari di Enziteto e dell’Officina degli Esordi. 
Entro settembre saranno almeno tre gli interventi
pubblici di grandi dimensioni. Nostro obiettivo è raccogliere più fondi
possibili per poter così ampliare il programma e ospitare un maggior numero di artisti.

A fine settembre l’Officina degli Esordi ospiterà
una mostra a cura di Pigment
Workroom durante la quale verranno esposte per tutto il mese a seguire le opere
su carta e tessuto realizzate.Cosa sta già accadendo 

Ecco alcuni interventi di questi giorni (Giugno 2015).

will also produce apparel, editorial items and gadgets. All of these items will
be given as rewards at -20% of their actual market value: your help is
fundamental for us in order to support the whole production cost of the
project, which includes travels, food and housing for the artists,
communication and materials.
It’s quite simple: the more
funds we raise, the more artists will come to Bari and the more walls will be
painted in San Pio and Libertà. So, help us and share this page as much as
possible! And don’t hesitate to be in touch with us if you want to be our
sponsor.

SHARE THIS AND SUPPORT US.
THANKS A LOT!

<p>Playa Art of this magnitude is what makes Burning Man the memorable, jaw dropping experience it is.

<p><span></span></p>
<p>The Tower of Babel, a story from the Book of Genesis, describes the origin of different languages and their disbursement around the world. As the story goes, humanity communicated via one universal language, and the people attempted to build a tower as high as the heavens, God, challenged by the possible power of a united community, dispersed humanity around the world causing the destruction of a universal language and the birth of a multilingual world. Although the story seems negative since communication became complicated, it also illustrates the birth of diversified expression and celebrates a variety of cultures. </p>

<h3><b>Ceremony:</b></h3>
<p>This diverse expression of sexuality will culminate in a ceremony, held on <b>Wednesday September 2nd at 7pm</b> on the playa, honoring each god and goddess, sex positivity, introspection, and acceptance. Through the ceremony we can cast aside old hang-ups, self-doubts, and frustrations as we create a circle to invoke and honor sexual deities from around the world and ask for their healing support both for ourselves and the world at large. </p>

</div> <div> <h3>What We Still Need:</h3> <p>Here's the list of project material cost breakdown:</p>

<p>Additional LEDs for the pyramid: $600</p>
<p>Printed photographs for the interior of the totem: $200</p>
<p>Plastic frames to protect the photographs: $200</p>
<p>Additional art supplies for final totem details: $200</p>
<p>Total: $2000</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact:</h3> <p>Sexual Babel aims to raise awareness around sexuality, both individually and collectively.

</div></div>","What is Sexual Babel? 

The Tower of Babel, a story from the Book of Genesis, describes the origin of different languages and their disbursement around the world. As the story goes, humanity communicated via one universal language, and the people attempted to build a tower as high as the heavens, God, challenged by the possible power of a united community, dispersed humanity around the world causing the destruction of a universal language and the birth of a multilingual world. Although the story seems negative since communication became complicated, it also illustrates the birth of diversified expression and celebrates a variety of cultures. 
Sex, also an integral part of our existence, holds a variety of languages which we use to connect, empower, oppress, and liberate. So let’s talk about that core communicative component of life: 

Throughout history cultures have worshiped, punished, denied, and explored sexuality, and now we have the opportunity to draw from those ancestral definitions and reflect on our own sexual identities in a global context: Sexual Babel.
What is sexuality? Is it a fixed and innate desire unaffected by choice? Or does our environment and experience influence our attraction and ability to intimately relate?  How do we balance the individual and collective identification of sexuality?
Sexual Babel explores and honors the representation of sex and various expressions of sexuality over time. Seven beautifully etched, mixed media totems are arranged in a protective circle, representing different historical belief systems about sexuality. The circle collectively represents sexuality, globally and historically, through form and photography, and encapsulates a lit pyramid of individual sexual expression. The pyramid itself connotes the connectedness that the Tower of Babel strove to unite, ultimately leading to the understanding that sexual power is not fixed and rather a fluid internal energy sustained by external relationships. 
Totems:Each totem represents different cultural deities throughout history and an associated aspect of sexuality. The totems and their representations include:
Aztec: Gender Neutrality
Xochiquetzal​ (the goddess of fertility, beauty,prostitutes and female sexual power) and her brother X​ochipilli​ (the god of love, art, beauty, dance, fertility, and song)

Chinese: Sexual Objectification

T​u Er Shen (​the god of love between homosexual men) and P​an Jinlian (​the goddess of fornication and prostitution)

Hindu: Sexual SpiritualityK​amadeva (the god of love and sexuality), his wife R​ati​ (the goddess of passion and lust), along with P​arvati (​the goddess of love, devotion, and fertility)

Mesopotamia/Babylonian/Greek: Ability to Explore Sexuality and Gender
Exterior of Mesopotamian Totem 
Love Goddesses: Inanna (war and fertility), Ishtar(sex, fertility, and war), and Aphrodite(pleasure, beauty, and procreation)

Moroccan: Female SexualityQ​andisa (​the goddess of lust who seduces men and then drives them insane)
Norse: Male Sexuality
F​reyr (​a phallic fertility god bestowing peace and pleasure on mortals)

Voodoo: Sex PositivityB​aron Samedi​ (the god of death, sex, and resurrection)

Photography:
The display of black and white photography within each totem creates a stark, contemplative space. Each totem contains two photographs representing the spectrum of the brightest possibilities when these sexual values are embraced and also the darkest impacts of sexual oppression. The series of images cover broad and complex spectrums of sexuality including sex trafficking, androgyny, fetishes, queer culture and more.

Pyramid:
At the center of the circle stands an acrylic pyramid (approximately 5 feet tall) covered in an array of RGB LEDs displaying multicolored animations, representing the fluidity of sexual energy.






LED Pyramid prototype- imagine it 5 feet tall animated with rainbow waves of love!

Individuals can write on the pyramid with colored sharpies expressing thoughts, feelings, ideas, and ultimately their own sexual identity as it relates to the sacred sexual space.



Ceremony:
This diverse expression of sexuality will culminate in a ceremony, held on Wednesday September 2nd at 7pm on the playa, honoring each god and goddess, sex positivity, introspection, and acceptance. Through the ceremony we can cast aside old hang-ups, self-doubts, and frustrations as we create a circle to invoke and honor sexual deities from around the world and ask for their healing support both for ourselves and the world at large. 



  What We Still Need: Here's the list of project material cost breakdown:
Acrylic Panels for the pyramid: $800
Additional LEDs for the pyramid: $600
Printed photographs for the interior of the totem: $200
Plastic frames to protect the photographs: $200
Additional art supplies for final totem details: $200
Total: $2000

    The Impact: Sexual Babel aims to raise awareness around sexuality, both individually and collectively. Participants are able to wander through the space, and reflect on and express their own sexual identity. The multitude of sexual expressions in the space display the diversity and fluidity of sexual identity while illustrating the power of choice and privilege associated with that choice. 
This interactive art piece stands as a conscious-raising effort around the temporality of labels and their subjective significance, allowing participants to examine chosen labels and confront socially constructed expectations that do not align with internal identifications. By supporting Sexual Babel you're helping to create a sex positive space that encourages participants to question, challenge, and explore the various ways sexuality shapes our perceptions of the self and relationship to others.

<p><i>My Your Our Water</i> began as a collaborative project with Scottsdale Public Art and Salt River Project focused on the water issues specific to the desert of Arizona but it quickly grew into a grassroots conversation about local, regional and global water issues. <i>My Your Our Water</i> is a multiplatform project of intersection, connectivity &amp; aesthetics that revolves around water. There are four components to the project, A Tricked-Out-Tricycle, A Blog,  A Community Facebook Page and a Floating Illuminated Sign.<br/><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>The Trike</b> was designed to be ridden along the 131 miles of canal paths that line the working canal system in the greater Phoenix, Arizona. During these canal rides, I engage other trail users in conversation about water: water ways, watersheds, water delivery systems, water quality, water resources, water recreation, water conservation, local water issues, national water issues and global water issues. Individuals are invited to participate in the project by submitting imagery of Water in their lives. <br/><b><br/></b></p>

<p><i>My Your Our Water</i>  has both a personal and global relevance.

<p>The TALK TO GOD phone booth is an interactive instalation that has touched the hearts, minds and souls thousands over its 14 year history.  This simple two way phone line a phone booth a God throne about 100+ft away, facilitates two strangers the chance to have some of the most intimate and profound conversations of their burn and their lives.  There is the right god for you on the other end of the line every time.</p>
<p>As it is now we are tied to a diesel generator for power and have to dig a trench to lay our power and phone cables.  This dramatically limits our ability for placement on the playa and our ability to install it at other events where we can not dig a 150ft trench across the event grounds.  </p>
<p>The GOD BOOTH 2.0 </p>
<p>Help us go solar and wireless with a new booth that is lighter,  brighter and more durable booth. Making build and strike much faster, and the booth will live indefinitely.  With LED backlit signage, upgraded mic's in the hand sets for clearer sound quality.  And don't forget the laser light pointing into the heavens, it comes on when you pick up the phone and make the connection to GOD.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <ul> <li>$1,900.00 IN BUILDING MATERIALS FOR THE NEW BOOTH.  We are going to do a round booth with backlit plexiglass floor, a printed backlit fish eye print of the heavens on top. Rolled steel structure with modular design for easy set up.</li>
<li>$700.00 ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS FOR WIRELESS SYSTEM. Two wireless routers and components, LED lighting, Upgraded microphones for both phones, phone line simulator, better digital recording device,  audio editing and promotions, webpage development and public promotions, speakers for the god throne area and misc connectors cables and switches. </li>
<li>$2,000.00 SOLAR SYSTEM AND BATTERIES.  Two separate solar systems. two 300w panels, two battery banks, two charge controllers, cables, enclosed batterie/electrical box with panel mounts. </li>

The TALK TO GOD phone booth is an interactive instalation that has touched the hearts, minds and souls thousands over its 14 year history.  This simple two way phone line a phone booth a God throne about 100+ft away, facilitates two strangers the chance to have some of the most intimate and profound conversations of their burn and their lives.  There is the right god for you on the other end of the line every time.
As it is now we are tied to a diesel generator for power and have to dig a trench to lay our power and phone cables.  This dramatically limits our ability for placement on the playa and our ability to install it at other events where we can not dig a 150ft trench across the event grounds.  
The GOD BOOTH 2.0 
Help us go solar and wireless with a new booth that is lighter,  brighter and more durable booth. Making build and strike much faster, and the booth will live indefinitely.  With LED backlit signage, upgraded mic's in the hand sets for clearer sound quality.  And don't forget the laser light pointing into the heavens, it comes on when you pick up the phone and make the connection to GOD.   What We Need   $1,900.00 IN BUILDING MATERIALS FOR THE NEW BOOTH.  We are going to do a round booth with backlit plexiglass floor, a printed backlit fish eye print of the heavens on top. Rolled steel structure with modular design for easy set up.
$700.00 ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS FOR WIRELESS SYSTEM. Two wireless routers and components, LED lighting, Upgraded microphones for both phones, phone line simulator, better digital recording device,  audio editing and promotions, webpage development and public promotions, speakers for the god throne area and misc connectors cables and switches. 
$2,000.00 SOLAR SYSTEM AND BATTERIES.  Two separate solar systems. two 300w panels, two battery banks, two charge controllers, cables, enclosed batterie/electrical box with panel mounts. 
 $300.00 Storage   $4,900.00 TOTAL 



What You Get.  Perks Offered




God Phone stickers with every contribution.
Your choice of Silver or Bronze Burning man Pendants designed by Miles Eastman 
Your choice of Silver or Bronze God Booth pendant designed by Miles Eastman
Your very own framed  TALK TO GOD sign. I am very excited about this light box backlit with LEDs.

The Impact With these changes we are frees to bring TALK TO GOD booth off playa.  It opens up the ability to install it at other festivals and events regardless of the environment or power limitations.    Taking TALK TO GOD off playa and sharing its magic to thousands more people  every year is a major motivator to do these upgrades. City streets, festivals, parties and any event anywhere are now accessible.  
Audio recording of selected conversations will be available and shared for spiritual and enlightening purposes. So many of the conversations are powerful and profound.  We are developing ways to share these with a wider audience.   The GOD phone has become an icon on the playa over the years, and with your help we can share this powerful instillation for connection and personal interaction that breaks down social, and spiritual boundaries.


    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Please contact us if you would like to help in other ways. If you have skills in electronics, web design, audio.  If your a DJ looking for sound clips.  We are open to collaborations of many kinds.

a dos compases diferentes. Dichas gotas caerán sobre dos contenedores de agua

<p>De esta manera, a
través de “Trama Trawa”, Norma vuelve a mostrar y a envolver los lugares

Alonso y alumno suyo en uno de los primeros talleres de artesanía que impartió
durante principios de la década del ’80, de hacer de la camisa de su padre una
obra de arte y un símbolo de todos aquellos hombres y mujeres desaparecidos en
dictadura cuyos cuerpos aún no son encontrados por sus familiares. Trawa en

los muros y a las camisas, sobre las cuales caerán constantemente gotas de agua
a dos compases diferentes. Dichas gotas caerán sobre dos contenedores de agua
hechos de resina poliéster transparente, desde los cuales el agua será bombeada
de vuelta al sistema hidráulico que las hará nuevamente caer y empapar. La obra
estará conformada además por sistemas de sonido e iluminación.
De esta manera, a
través de “Trama Trawa”, Norma vuelve a mostrar y a envolver los lugares
silenciosos e invisibles que ha venido sugiriendo a través de sus sucesivas
creaciones. Y da cumplimento a la labor que le encomendara Yuri Gahona, hijo de
Alonso y alumno suyo en uno de los primeros talleres de artesanía que impartió
durante principios de la década del ’80, de hacer de la camisa de su padre una
obra de arte y un símbolo de todos aquellos hombres y mujeres desaparecidos en
dictadura cuyos cuerpos aún no son encontrados por sus familiares. Trawa en
mapudungún puede significar “cuerpo” o “piel”
La obra audiovisual
En paralelo
a la exposición de Norma Ramírez, será exhibido de manera permanente en la sala
Microcine del museo, el documental que relata el proceso de creación de la
obra.
Compromiso
Esta
obra, que no obtuvo apoyo del Fondo para la Cultura y las Artes, requiere de
una inversión importante en materiales y tecnología. La decisión de llevarla a
cabo, obedece al compromiso moral que como persona y como artista Norma Ramírez
a tenido a lo largo de su trayectoria artística. 
La opción de hacer
un documental en paralelo, obedece a la necesidad de dejar un testimonio y
material de consultación, que conecta con la misión que se dió el MMDH de
aportar con reflexión y educación al tema de los derechos humanos, utilizando
como soporte diferentes medios y expresiones artísticas. 
Con el
dinero recaudado vamos a financiar la compra de los materiales, el arriendo de
los equipos de grabación y edición del video, la copia y estuche de los DVD.

worked as a professional bush regenerator for the last twenty years. </p>
<p>Not many people are lucky enough to experience the
subtle beauty of the Australian native rainforest - its shapes, colours and
forms - as I do almost daily. That's why I'd like to share them with you. This
is how it happens: I find a sample of a flower or fruit, put it in a bag and
bring it home. Then I draw it as soon as possible while it is still fresh and alive. The only exceptions are threatened species,
which I draw in the bush. I use a nib pen dipped in ink, and draw on clear
acetate cell. This is a technique I learned while working in cartoon animation studios
in Sydney in the 1980s, when these things were still done by hand. </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431223018/vfu6bdine4urxhqcbtt9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>I love the work I do by day, and I can't wait to

<p>And
what's been under the bed? Some of the drawings I'm completing now were started
as early as 1994 and have been stored under my bed ever since, so it's high
time they ""came out"". I call them ""botanical cartoons""
because, while they are quite interpretative and freely drawn, in most ways
they are botanically ""correct"",  and the authentic link with the
tradition of cartooning is clear in the techniques I use. </p>

<p>The
notion of ""botanical cartoons"" is an idea I came up with because the
plants are presented as if at two or three moments in their life cycle,
especially flowering and fruiting. They could almost be individual cells taken
from a cartoon movie of the life of that plant.</p>
<p>There's
one other thing, and it's about the quirky layout, where I give each design its
own number and frame. When I was at primary school, we used to collect and
trade Scanlen's Gum cards. So now I'm creating my own set, inspired not by TV shows
or sporting heroes, but by the flowers, leaves and fruits of Australian plants.

<p>I
spent much of my childhood exploring the bush in the Hunter Valley, walking
along creeks and being fascinated by the native plants and animals, so bringing these drawings to the public is much like a coming home for me. </p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The NSW North Coast of Australia has
been my home now for over twenty years and includes the ""Big Scrub"". This was originally a vast area of subtropical rainforest which was once 75,000 hectares but has been reduced to only 1% of its original size. The remaining 750 hectares contains a number of rare and endangered species and is also the land of the Bundjalung Aboriginal nation.</span></p>

<p>I
am happy to report that my daytime work over the last twenty years has
contributed to the preservation of many valuable areas of native vegetation in
this area. My night time (and rainy day) drawings are an extension of that
experience, and I hope that they may intrigue and excite you into exploring and
loving the Australian bush.</p>

<div> <p>Conservation has been a lifetime preoccupation of mine - country halls, grammar and punctuation marks, gum cards and most importantly, the Australian bush, which is under siege on numerous fronts.  </p>
<p>The difference your contribution will make is that you will be participating quite directly in my determination to popularise and promote the values of the Australian rainforest by celebrating their forms and colours. I think celebrating the intimate and rarely seen moments in the life cycle (flowers, fruits and falling parts) of rainforest species, is ultimately more worthwhile than lamenting their demise.</p>
<p>I have a long track record of completing art projects, from professional TV and film set design, to graphic arts and illustration of journals, commissioned works and public art. I am committed to this project, one way or another.</p>

own number and frame. When I was at primary school, we used to collect and
trade Scanlen's Gum cards. So now I'm creating my own set, inspired not by TV shows
or sporting heroes, but by the flowers, leaves and fruits of Australian plants.
 



I
spent much of my childhood exploring the bush in the Hunter Valley, walking
along creeks and being fascinated by the native plants and animals, so bringing these drawings to the public is much like a coming home for me. 

The NSW North Coast of Australia has
been my home now for over twenty years and includes the ""Big Scrub"". This was originally a vast area of subtropical rainforest which was once 75,000 hectares but has been reduced to only 1% of its original size. The remaining 750 hectares contains a number of rare and endangered species and is also the land of the Bundjalung Aboriginal nation.

I
am happy to report that my daytime work over the last twenty years has
contributed to the preservation of many valuable areas of native vegetation in
this area. My night time (and rainy day) drawings are an extension of that
experience, and I hope that they may intrigue and excite you into exploring and
loving the Australian bush.




What We Need & What You Get

I would like to encourage you to contribute to the production of a series of 16 greeting cards and the first of a three-part series of fun and educational colouring books, which in turn will help me to present my collection of works at a gallery in Byron Bay in November 2015. 
Your assistance would allow me to realise a long-held ambition to complete a body of work which has spent too long under the bed. By the end of June 2015, I will have 48 works ready for exhibition and printing. 



Completion of this first collection will enable me to continue the project into the future, and also to produce a high-quality art book for launch at my exhibition this year. 
I am seeking AU$25,950 to assist me with....




1.  Production of 100 fun, educational colouring books
$2,200


2.  Production of 100 high
  quality art books
$2,500


3.  Production of 320 greeting
  cards (20 of 16 designs)
$    900


4.  Production of my first
  exhibition November 2015
$7,000


5.  Photography & Graphic Design for Series #1
  Collection (48 works)
$ 1,500


6.  Media advertising of
  exhibition event locally & nationally
$3,000


7.  Materials 
$8,850


                                                                                                                      Total  AU

$25,950








Your Impact


 Conservation has been a lifetime preoccupation of mine - country halls, grammar and punctuation marks, gum cards and most importantly, the Australian bush, which is under siege on numerous fronts.  
The difference your contribution will make is that you will be participating quite directly in my determination to popularise and promote the values of the Australian rainforest by celebrating their forms and colours. I think celebrating the intimate and rarely seen moments in the life cycle (flowers, fruits and falling parts) of rainforest species, is ultimately more worthwhile than lamenting their demise.
I have a long track record of completing art projects, from professional TV and film set design, to graphic arts and illustration of journals, commissioned works and public art. I am committed to this project, one way or another.




Risks & Challenges

 The challenge has always been to finish a functional collection of work in my spare time, while working full time in the bush during the day. Time is the issue. Sheer determination and many late nights will get me there in the end, but the support of my team and your contribution will go a long way towards supporting me to achieve my project on time and to the quality I desire.


                                              


Other Ways You Can Help 
Your financial contribution would be appreciated, but if you can't do that, you can still be part of the campaign by telling your friends about my work, by clicking the Share buttons on the top left hand corner of this page, or by coming to the Byron Bay exhibition in November. Please let me know if you would like to be on the exhibition invitation list by emailing me at macarang6@gmail.com

 well, it didn't explode; rather it shattered internally. 
Hi there, we are Secret Weapon Designs from Houston TX. A small group of creative custom Fabricators and Artists, we are passionate about experimental fine art, unique furniture, custom products and accessories of any kind; and anything we can paint, build or make.     This past Thursday April 23, 2015, while running a project for the Houston Rescue Pet Movement our laser malfunctioned and the laser tube internally shattered, rendering our large laser cutter/engraver useless. 
For the past year we have been providing Houston businesses a valuable Laser cutting service to grow and expand their businesses. Our creative team delivers unique solutions in the form of carpentry, murals, signs, fineart, apparel, and jewlery.

  What We Need & What You Get Time to break it down for folks in more detail:  We need a replacement tube, plus crowd-funding fees. Through our art we are able to pursue our passions and express ourselves, however, the catch 22 is that without this key piece of equipment none of our endeavors can come to fruition.

Here is the actual part http://www.lightobject.com/High-Quality-Reci-13...


Even if we don't reach our goal the machine must be repaired. Every dollar toward our goal helps ease the financial strain and gets you an amazing thank you gift for a once in a lifetime price.

    


The Impact 
        Without your support getting back up and running will be a struggle. As one of the largest and most powerful lasers in Houston, Our creative team, along with this machine, allow many businesses that would otherwise not be able to afford custom work get high quality products, Made in Houston, at a reasonable cost.

<div>Web of Dreams was born as Suspension of Disbelief, and the debut was at an event called ""Seacompression"" in November of 2013. It was just a small set up, but it was a hit! Since then, we have set it up at a number of events, including the Seattle Mini Maker Faire, Georgetown Carnival, SOAK (a Portland area event) and have also taken it to Burning Man in 2014. </div> </div> <div> <h3>We need your help!</h3> <p>We want to keep growing this dream. Currently, all of our rope panels are made from 1/4 inch nylon, and we attach it to scaffolding. We want to get away from renting scaffolding every time we set Web of Dreams up, and we want to use materials that are renewable.The ultimate goal is to avoid an adverse environmental impact when burning it. So we put our heads together and came up with the idea for some pretty amazing, super durable, easily transportable (collapsible!!) trees! Who doesn't love hanging in a hammock in the trees?</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We have also found some pretty incredible nylon rope alternatives in hemp and cotton. The thing is, we need A LOT of it! About 60k feet! Cotton is going to be cheaper and softer, but hemp is stronger. Transporting and storing Web of Dreams also brings it's own problems, and we would love to have a box truck dedicated to that. The easier we can make the storing and (especially) transporting, the more events we can go to!</span><br/></p>
<p>So here is how what we are asking for breaks down:</p>
<p>Trees - Our central tree will be around $600-700. The outer 6 trees will be $1000-1100 (if we use OSB plywood). Cost for smaller trees is based upon 6 trees 12' tall no wider than 8' at base, with a central 4x4 post all the panels attach to.               <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Total - $7300</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Rope - $127.78/spool of cotton rope (1200 ft/spool) - $6,389</p>
<p>                                  -or-</p>
<p>              $123.72/spool of hemp rope (600 ft/spool) -  $12,372</p>
<p>Stretch Goals:</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Box Truck - No more than $3,000 we hope!
