<div> </div>
<div>My husband Jose immigrated to the United States from El Salvador in March 2000, obtaining legal status by qualifying for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). However, upon renewal in 2009, it came to light that he was no longer eligible for this program due to tickets he received in 2006 and was placed into removal proceedings in the immigration court system. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We had been together since May 2007 and our son was born in 2008, so we decided to pursue legal status for Jose so that he could continue to live in the United States with his family. If we married, I could petition for him to obtain a visa through me, as his spouse. Since we had been engaged since Christmas Eve 2007, it only made sense to move up our timeline and get married. We were married in 2011, and I filed a Petition for Alien Relative (I-130), attended an interview to certify our marriage was legit, and the application was approved!! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>While getting ready to move onto the next steps of the visa process, a change in procedure was announced by USCIS that would promote family unity and the amount of time Jose would spend away from us when he went to finish his visa application in El Salvador. Even though it was announced in March 2012, it is still pending with no official ETA as to when it will be implemented. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>On October 16, 2012, Jose attended a Master Hearing in federal immigration court. The judge denied our request for administrative closure, denied our request for cancellation of removal proceedings, and denied our request for a continuance to wait for the new program to go into effect. Instead, Jose was granted the ""privilege"" to voluntarily depart the United States, his home of almost 12 years, leaving behind his wife and 4 year old son. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>My husband is now an ""illegal"" immigrant and was given 120 days to depart, setting it at February 13, 2013... the day before Valentine's Day and 6 days shy of our 2 year wedding anniversary. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>He was given a 10 year ban from entering the United States for ""unlawful presence"" that he accrued while he was here without ""status"" after 2009. He was also fitted with a GPS monitoring ankle bracelet that he will wear until he leaves, must check-in every 2 weeks and has a home visit every Friday. If he does not comply with this intensive monitoring program, he will be put into immigration detention indefinitely until he is sent back to El Salvador. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also, because the judge denied any and all requests for more time to pursue our case, and gave him the order of deportation, we cannot file another renewal of his work authorization card, which allows him to legally continue working in the United States until he leaves. This forced him to leave his job of almost 4 years. We are now down to one income, and I am currently seeking an additional part time job to supplement our income, on top of my full time job I've had for the past 10 years. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We have a very long road ahead of us... many documents to gather, applications to file that each carry hefty filing fees, a trip to Chicago to renew his passport at the El Salvador consulate, flight arrangements to make and pay for (he is required to arrange and pay for his own flight home) and also make sure he attends all mandatory check in's to comply with his monitoring program.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The amount of support we have received has been overwhelming... Family, friends, co-workers past and present of both of us, friends of friends, immigration advocates, fellow families facing the same issues... All of you have been amazing!!! We appreciate the prayers, hugs, love, well wishes, phone calls and texts... they have lifted us up at a time when we feel so defeated! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We also appreciate your newly discovered passion for understanding immigration and the need for immigration reform. It is wonderful to see people becoming more involved!!! This isn't just happening to Jose, Austen and I, it is happening to thousands of families all over! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am honored that my family can finally put a FACE to the immigration debate. I am passionate about education and reform because this has so directly affected my life for the past 5 years and will continue to be a part of my family's life for many years to come.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We have a VERY long road ahead of us, and the financial impact of pursing Jose's legal status has always been one of the biggest issues for us. </div>
<div>What many do not realize is the COST of becoming ""legal"", getting that ""green card"", doing it ""the right way"". Not to mention the TIME it takes... Time to gather documents to prove everything about you, your life, your relationships, your past... Time for processing, time spent waiting, time spent away from those you love... It is unimaginable to those that have not dealt with it personally.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here is a glimpse at the amount of money we need to continue Jose's Visa journey... (All of the application fee amounts are subject to change and can be found at <a href=""http://www.uscis.gov"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.uscis.gov</a>)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1. Obtain new passport - $65.00</div>
<div>2. I-864 Affidavit of Support filing fee - $88.00</div>
<div>3. DS260 Immigrant Visa Application - $230.00</div>
<div>4. Gather civil documents, background checks, police checks/certificates, FBI records check, court records, court dispositions - unknown amount $$$</div>
<div>5. Plane ticket to El Salvador - $400 to $500 approx </div>
<div>6. Medical Exam and vaccinations in El Salvador before interview, courier fees - $300 approx</div>
<div>7. Visa interview - travel to/from Consulate for interview - unknown amount $$$</div>
<div>8. I-601 Waiver of Inadmissibilities Application - $585.00</div>
<div>9. If all of the above is approved... Travel to/from Consulate to pick up Visa - unknown amount $$$ </div>
<div>10. Plane ticket home - $400 to $500 approx </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The amount of the above figures, adding $100 for civil documents and $200 for travel to/from Consulate is a grand total of....</div>
<div> </div>
<div>$2,568.00</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now, it doesn't sound like a lot, but to Jose and I it is a TON of money. Especially since we are down to one income now. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So several friends have mentioned they would be interested in chipping in and showing support by giving $10 or $20 here and there. I wanted to put our story out there, show the amount of money needed, and make sure that any money we do get from supporters goes strictly towards this Visa journey fund. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have never been one to ask for help or try and get money that I haven't worked for. It is tearing Jose apart that he isn't allowed to work to support our family. But I have promised him that I will do whatever it takes to get us through this... and if that means ignoring my pride and asking for help, I will do it. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you know Jose personally, you know that he is a ""gentle giant""... Quick to smile, to jump in and help anyone who needs it, a friendly guy, laid-back and easygoing, an amazing father, a wonderful husband, hardworking and kind... just an all-around wonderful man. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The biggest impact all of the above has on our live is the separation from his son and I for months and months while all this paperwork processes. He could be gone anywhere from 6 months to a year or more, possibly. If the waiver to overcome the 10 year ban is denied, I do not know what we will do. But I am praying at this point we can be approved and will not allow myself to think of the alternative. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Austen is going to be the one that suffers most... as he is his daddy's boy, they have spent every day of the last 4 years together, only apart for the occasional sleepover for Austen at Aunt Nikki's. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I do not even know how to start explaining to Austen that his dad will be almost 2000 miles away for half a year or more. That Daddy won't be here to tuck him in at night, give him a bath, scratch his back, or play cars. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The thought of them being separated puts a pain in my chest and has caused constant tears on both Jose and I's part since last Tuesday when the judge gave us the date of 2/13/13. A date that will spread my family apart... all for some pieces of paper and a ""status"". </div>
<div> </div>
<div>And that's all it is really... It will not change who Jose is... who I am... who our son is... at the end of the day, we are a family. We have been through so much together already. We will get through this, too. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>But in the meantime, we will be separated by a mere lack of ""status"". </div>
<div> </div>
<div>And that is sad. </div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>MMC, at UW Seattle, is a collective aiming to build a community of humans who enjoying listening, writing, reading and performing. Since our start in 2011, we have attended the College Unions Poetry Slam Invitational (CUPSI) every year. For more information on CUPSI, visit <a href=""http://www.acui.org/programs/student/program.aspx?id=19091"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.acui.org/programs/student/program.aspx?id=19091</a>. We have preliminary poetry slams in the Fall quarter and a Grand Slam in Winter to pick 5 poets to form a team to represent UW on a national level. In addition to our slam series, MMC also runs a bi-monthly open mic. </span></p>
<p>The slam team is unique because it selects talented writers and challenges them to do more. This will be the FOURTH year we'll send a team to rep UW at the College Unions Poetry Slam Invitational (CUPSI). Our first year, we placed sixth. In the last two years, we had a piece featured at the Group Piece Showcase. We have two (un-paid) coaches who lead weekly practices where the teammates rehearse their individual poems and write team poems. These meetings build the poet's identity as writers, and help them engage in critical conversations about difference. When poets come together to write, they have to bridge their different viewpoints to find meaning. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are aiming to reach a minimum fundraising goal of $1400 in the next month in order to pay for lodging in New York City for the team. We are organizing a number of different fundraising events throughout the month of March, however we are hoping to extend our reach to members in our community who wish to give electronically.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span>It is understatement to say CUPSI is an influential experience for poets and coaches. To give you an idea, I’m including a quote by Senior Psychology &amp; Computer Science double major Katie McCorkell, co-president of MMC, a past team member and team manager:</span></p>
<p><em><span>“The first time I was on a slam team, I didn't think I should be there. I didn't think I was good enough or had anything important to say. I liked my poems, but I didn't see myself being competitive at a national level. Two months of rehearsals culminating in a week of competition completely changed that. Because of the confidence I gained on the team, I was able to share my poems in other arenas, such as the ASUW EveryBody Every Body fashion show, the ACLU 75th fundraiser and KUOW's radio show Weekday. I developed public speaking skills such that I applied to be a TA for computer science, which subsequently lead me to get a great internship this summer. What I am saying is that the slam team and CUPSI experience is unlike any other. At CUPSI we meet people from all across the country who are passionate about the same thing. Last year I met students from Washington University St. Louis and University of Hawaii. Not only do we network with passionate peers, but we also engage in conversations about race, gender, disability, and other important political issues.”</span></em></p>

<p>For those of you who do not know, I have been working as a ghost-writer: conducting interviews, researching, transcribing and narrating the heroic and heart-wrenching story of the life of James Kofi Annan.  </p>
<p>James was 6 years old when his father sold him into slavery and he was sent 9 hours away from home to work on Ghana’s Lake Volta. At 6 years old James was forced to work 12 hour days on an empty stomach as the hot sun burned his skin and his master repeatedly beat him like a herder would do to cattle that disobeyed. </p>
<p>Now, at 38 years old James and his organization Challenging Heights are rescuing children from slavery and attacking child rights issues at the source. </p>
<p>I am here to not only write this memoir but I am here to help tell the world about the issue of child slavery in Ghana. Once published, this book will raise funds for Challenging Heights so that children can not only be rescued but so children are no longer trafficked and abused. So children get the rights they deserve. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What am I asking of you? </h3>
<p>I have been offered full support by Challenging Heights to continue working on this book in Ghana but then I thought, if I take the financial offer, which program suffers? Which child is not rescued or what mother does not receive financial support for her family?</p>
<p>In lieu of accepting the salary I have set a goal of raising $3,200 so that I may return to Ghana and use my writing skills to help Challenging Heights become more sustainable. </p>

In 2010, we launched our 24/7 Campaign where we were able to raise over $4,000 in two days to help at least seven children of migrant workers and refugees attend school. I'm also an award-winning multimedia journalist and blogger.
The Project

Arab Springâ€™s Forgotten Minorities
The Arab uprisings caused a major political shift in the Middle East and North Africa as millions of people took to the streets to demand dignity and that their voices are heard. However, as the struggle for democracy continues many ethnic minorities and indigenous populations are using the historic moment to force leaders to address long-standing grievances.
Arab Springâ€™s Forgotten Minorities is a response to the attention mainstream media has given to the role of social media during the uprisings while little has been said about the plight of ethnic minorities or indigenous peoples.
Western Sahara and the Arab Spring
The Western Sahara is a disputed territory in North Africa, bordered by Morocco to the north, Algeria to the northeast, Mauritania to the east and south and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. Tens of thousands of Saharawis have been displaced from their lands and their struggle represents one of the worldâ€™s longest-running conflicts.
Noam Chomsky argues that the Arab Spring didnâ€™t begin in Tunisia but can be traced back to the massive protest camp that appeared in the Western Sahara last year. Like the uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt and Syria, the people who erected a month-long tent city at Gdeim Izik were protesting against unemployment, rising food prices and basic human rights.
Most importantly they were demanding an end to the thirty-six year Moroccan occupation and suppression of their culture, which began in 1976 when the Spanish departed.
Western Sahara and the Arab Spring will look at the Saharawi culture, traditions and their struggle for autonomy. Social and humanitarian challenges facing Saharawi women will also be examined. It will also examine the impact of an illegal 2005 fishing agreement known as the FPA (Fisheries Partnership Agreement) between the European Union (EU) and Morocco, which generates an estimated $196 million over a four-year period, on the Saharawi peopleâ€™s economy and livelihoods.
Patience Runs Thin Amongst Egyptâ€™s Nubians
In the wake of Egyptâ€™s January 25 uprising, nearly three million Nubians are demanding their land rights. For thousands of years, the Nubians lived in villages along the banks of the Nile, stretching from Aswan in southern Egypt to northern Sudan. Despite retaining their own distinct language, culture and customs, many have been forced to end their way of life and abandon their lands.
Egyptâ€™s ambitions to industrialize with the construction of the Aswan High Dam project in the 1950â€™s, which was intended to provide more land for agriculture and boost the countryâ€™s electricity production, resulted in massive displacement and flooding of the lands of old Nubia.
Although activists have been pressing Egyptâ€™s government to address their long-standing grievances for decades, the recent Arab Spring has given the Nubians a fresh impetus.
Recently, the Nubians embarked on a seven-day sit-in in front of the Aswan governorate, which ended on September 11 after the interim government of Prime Minister Essam Sharaf agreed to repatriate the Nubians to areas surrounding Lake Nasser and implement development projects. The latest sit-in is the fourth demonstration since the countryâ€™s 18-day revolt.
Patience Runs Thin Amongst Egyptâ€™s Nubians will examine the Nubian tradition, culture and their connection to the land. It will also look at the historical role women played in ancient Nubia and their present day challenges. Finally, this piece will also look at the impact of climate change on the Nubian Nile Valley and the impact of the Aswan High Dam or Saad el-Aali on Nubian farmers.
Berber Spring
Tunisiaâ€™s ethnic minority population of Berbers, who make up only one percent of the countryâ€™s ten million inhabitants, continue to demand an end to decades of government restrictions over their cultural identity.
For many Berbers, official recognition of their native tongue â€“ Tamazight â€“ would see their aspirations for a new Tunisia realized.
Demands for Arab unity during post-colonial rule saw a sharp decline in spoken Tamazight. Despite being fierce opponents of North Africaâ€™s Arab rulers, the original inhabitants of the region are still denied their right to have their language spoken or taught in schools, during their annual cultural festival and non-Arab names on official state registries.
Berber Spring will explore a rich culture that dates back almost four thousand years including their distinctive dances and variety of musical styles.

How will it help?
A year following the Arab Spring, many communities in North Africa are still on the verge of extinction. Their languages, culture and land rights are disappearing by the minute - which is why we have to act NOW to tell their stories. 
What We Need
Since the traditional venues for funding independent journalism have disappeared, I am appealing to you for help. Your support will cover air/train travel costs, accommodations/food, professional translators, fixers, transportation, creating the incentives that are offered and drivers (to access places that are not accessible via public transport).


Documentation will be posted on my personal blog, Witnessing Life and Taste Culture. Issues relating to the environment and gender will also be blogged on Inter Press News Service (IPS), Open Salon and the International Museum of Women's Her Blueprint.


What You Get
Now on to the incentives! We're offering an Oral E-History for anyone who gives $50 or more, which is an ebook that will bring together special interviews alongside images. Being a lover of music and a DJ I'll also be acquiring music along the way which you will find slipped into the packages as digital downloads. There's also E-Tastes, which will be a nice treat for all those who enjoy trying new foods! 

Better than the Oral E-History is the Oral E-Herstory! Glance over to the right to get a better look at what you get!


Here's a bit of a challenge. YOU donate at least $25. Then YOU forward this link to 10 PEOPLE and get them to donate $25 too. Thus, the 25:10 Challenge. (larger contributions are more than welcome and are rewarded with a sliding scale of 'grateful love' gifts listed on the right. Donations are also available for tax deductions through my fiscal sponsor if interested.
 
Thanks to the Indie GoGo tools I can keep track of how many people you are referring back to this page (if you are using the share tools provided on this page so I can see how many of your referrals donate! So, here's a little extra incentive! I am offering the 'Oral E-Herstory' gift to you for getting all 10 friends to contribute $25. But you don't have to stop at 10 friends. For whoever gets the most people to donate $25 or whoever raises the most money through your referrals, I am offering you the 'Limited Edition' gift.

<p><strong>Hook of Hope</strong> is about walking with me through my journey of challenges and adversity. It illustrates how one can overcome challenges by having hope.<br/><br/>My name is Nurjahan Khatun, and I am the author of <strong>Hook of Hope</strong>. I wrote this book because I wanted to empower others to believe that they too can overcome challenges in life by not giving up on life and by having hope.<br/><br/>My objective is that, in reading this book, you will discover nothing remains static forever and that we all have an amazing amount of belief if only we choose to tap into it. I want you to see this book as <strong>an opportunity to learn how we need to anchor ourselves onto hope, not people</strong>. It will cover themes around identity, suffering, betrayal, judgement, and survival. I want you to see how the more we talk about difficult topics that make people feel uncomfortable, the more we break down barriers and give others hope. I want you to go on this journey with me in my book, where you will learn <strong>how I build bridges in communities to uplift others, empower others and learn from others to bring back humanity</strong>.<br/><br/><strong>My book is written with the intention that it will help others to have hope.</strong> Growing up in the 1980s meant that I am a daughter of immigrants who came to the UK in hopes of being able to provide for their families both here and back home. Growing up in an environment where there was never any desire to see women do particularly well, nor did they have much of a voice. <strong>It was very much the norm to remain silent, ask no questions, and do what you are told.</strong> Be it cleaning, cooking, babysitting, and following any and every instruction given to you.</p>
<p>Your role as a girl and later a woman was to do what pleased the family, and if you did that, you were known as an obedient, well-mannered, and well-cultured daughter.<strong> </strong>That was me, initially, but after a while this felt as though it was going against my DNA. I was not comfortable nor happy that there was a clear divide between the two genders. I would feel rage as I would never be given credit for my achievements. <strong>With each attempt to raise my own voice, I was stuck down with either a slap across my face or being told to shut up</strong>.<br/><br/>I share in this book <strong>how I dared to be brave, dared to be courageous, and dared to think for myself</strong>. I battled through how I wanted to carve out my own identity on my terms, according to who I knew I was and not by others’ opinions of me. That was the beginning of my journey to have my own voice and demand it wherever I went because I wanted to control my own narrative. <strong>My voice kept being silenced, and I could not carry on in that way.</strong> So I planned to escape that environment so I could be heard, so I could have my own voice. My life has been a roller coaster ride filled with ups and downs. Despite what life threw at me, I preserved, I never gave up, I decided I would never change for anyone anymore, I remained true, I remained authentic, and that I am in control of my own story.<br/><br/>Despite my baba naming me ‘<strong>Nurjahan</strong>,’ which means ‘<strong>bringing light into the world</strong>,’ I certainly did not feel that there was any light in my world, nor I was able to be a light for myself—until I broke free, until I could be my own voice, and until I became the light in my own world.<br/><br/><strong>You will love this book if you are passionate about empowering others around you, if you need someone to believe in you and if you are in a rut in life and want motivation to do better.</strong><br/><br/>Hook of Hope speaks to women and young people who want to grapple with change and overcome fear in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Hook of Hope inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I overcome difficult challenges and survive?</li>
<li>How can communities support those who are going through challenging times?</li>
<li>How can we together bring back humanity and stop judging others?</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers.</p>
<p><strong>I believe discussing identity, immigrant communities, of survival, women’s empowerment, using your voice, struggles, sacrifice, betrayals and judgements will change us all for the better.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - Hook of Hope</h3>The book is written in several chapters.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1 </strong>contains the author’s note + chapters on my childhood and growing up. It will describe why I felt it was important to share my story and takes you through the early years of my childhood, and how they <strong>shaped me to have resilience from a young age</strong>. It will explore how I was always told that I would never become anything in life, and how that used to really weigh me down as a young child.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters about my relationship with my family/community and especially with my Baba. It showcases how <strong>I never saw a way out as I was growing up, having seen so much negativity in my community</strong>. I then go on to share how those relationships gave me great anxiety and impacted my mental health and well being from the very beginning.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3 </strong>contains chapters on me progressing into adulthood through getting my education, career, and marriage. Here I really navigate having to deal with multiple types of people, how I had to f<strong>ind my own coping strategies so I could still be the best version of myself</strong> and how I broke many glass ceilings.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> contains chapters of me sharing how I overcame trails and tribulations. I share how<strong> I gave up on life and hit rock bottom many times</strong>. How it took every ounce of energy from my body, mind, and soul to understand fear and get comfortable with being just me all over again so I can then give hope to others.<br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>

It was very much the norm to remain silent, ask no questions, and do what you are told. Be it cleaning, cooking, babysitting, and following any and every instruction given to you.
Your role as a girl and later a woman was to do what pleased the family, and if you did that, you were known as an obedient, well-mannered, and well-cultured daughter. That was me, initially, but after a while this felt as though it was going against my DNA. I was not comfortable nor happy that there was a clear divide between the two genders. I would feel rage as I would never be given credit for my achievements. With each attempt to raise my own voice, I was stuck down with either a slap across my face or being told to shut up.I share in this book how I dared to be brave, dared to be courageous, and dared to think for myself. I battled through how I wanted to carve out my own identity on my terms, according to who I knew I was and not by others’ opinions of me. That was the beginning of my journey to have my own voice and demand it wherever I went because I wanted to control my own narrative. My voice kept being silenced, and I could not carry on in that way. So I planned to escape that environment so I could be heard, so I could have my own voice. My life has been a roller coaster ride filled with ups and downs. Despite what life threw at me, I preserved, I never gave up, I decided I would never change for anyone anymore, I remained true, I remained authentic, and that I am in control of my own story.Despite my baba naming me ‘Nurjahan,’ which means ‘bringing light into the world,’ I certainly did not feel that there was any light in my world, nor I was able to be a light for myself—until I broke free, until I could be my own voice, and until I became the light in my own world.You will love this book if you are passionate about empowering others around you, if you need someone to believe in you and if you are in a rut in life and want motivation to do better.Hook of Hope speaks to women and young people who want to grapple with change and overcome fear in a new way.Ultimately, I hope that Hook of Hope inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:

How can I overcome difficult challenges and survive?
How can communities support those who are going through challenging times?
How can we together bring back humanity and stop judging others?

I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers.
I believe discussing identity, immigrant communities, of survival, women’s empowerment, using your voice, struggles, sacrifice, betrayals and judgements will change us all for the better.
 
The Book - Hook of HopeThe book is written in several chapters.Part 1 contains the author’s note + chapters on my childhood and growing up. It will describe why I felt it was important to share my story and takes you through the early years of my childhood, and how they shaped me to have resilience from a young age. It will explore how I was always told that I would never become anything in life, and how that used to really weigh me down as a young child.Part 2 contains chapters about my relationship with my family/community and especially with my Baba. It showcases how I never saw a way out as I was growing up, having seen so much negativity in my community. I then go on to share how those relationships gave me great anxiety and impacted my mental health and well being from the very beginning.Part 3 contains chapters on me progressing into adulthood through getting my education, career, and marriage. Here I really navigate having to deal with multiple types of people, how I had to find my own coping strategies so I could still be the best version of myself and how I broke many glass ceilings.Part 4 contains chapters of me sharing how I overcame trails and tribulations. I share how I gave up on life and hit rock bottom many times. How it took every ounce of energy from my body, mind, and soul to understand fear and get comfortable with being just me all over again so I can then give hope to others. What I Need & What You'll Get

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>It’s the thrill of the open road, that unforgettable stretch of pavement where every corner bends at just the right angle and you never miss a shift. The wonder of city lights twinkling in the distance as you look out from the edge of the hotel's infinity spa pool, cold drink in hand, mist rising from the surface of the water. Or the joy of a long awaited road trip with your best friend, saddlebags packed and that unmistakable exhaust note of a potent V-twin engine exploding off nearby mountain walls. This is what VI<strong>CAR</strong>IOUS is all about!      </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573333622/xxeeaowyfnr5ubswgjzg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

Together with our digital flip magazine and website, it would deliver a truly emotional experience.</p>

<b>If we manage to raise more money than we have asked for with this campaign, Fantastic!! It will enable us to publish a collection of all ten books in one magnificent special edition.</b></div>","We’ve woken up Joburg! Help us continue!

Wake up, this is Joburg tells the stories of ten ordinary, interesting, odd or outrageous denizens of the city of Johannesburg. Some are newly arrived, some are long-time residents, but all have found a way to inhabit urban space in unusual ways, carving out a living—and a life—in an alternative economy, flying by the seat of their proverbial pants, or working the same job in the same building for decades. All are, in their own ways, survivors: of the dramatic changes that the city has seen in the last twenty years, of successive waves of xenophobia, of political upheaval here and in countries elsewhere on the continent. Some have simply not moved in decades, preferring to sit things out and watch the city transform on their doorstep, making the most of what it brings them. Wake up, this is Joburg is about that thing you can’t quite put a finger on when you tell people why you live here.

The text of each book is English with an additional translation of
the text in a language that is familiar to the key protagonist in the story.  Each book speaks—through images and text—to an important aspect of South
African culture and society, providing insight into social issues and
provoking new ways to help address or think about them.     

                            
                        


Mark Lewis has been photographing
professionally since the eighties when his fashion photography appeared in Face, Blitz and Vogue magazines. His recent documentary photography includes
workers in Swaziland, the city of Mogadishu, Ship breakers in Bangladesh and of
course the intimate portraits and scenes of people and places in Johannesburg. The photographs from the Wake Up series were exhibited in the South African
pavilion of the Venice Biennale in July 2015.

Tanya Zack is an urban planner
who straddles the worlds of planning practice, policy and academia. Her
planning experience over 25 years in Johannesburg has included research, and
large scale planning frameworks policy as well as participatory and activist
planning. Her work has focused on inner city Johannesburg and this is the
setting for much of the in-depth research that goes into the writing of the
Wake Up This Is Joburg series. She holds a PhD in planning.
The series has attracted an enormous amount of interest from both scholarly and popular reviewers, and has contributed to lively
public discourse around many topics. We're often on the radio, television, in newspapers and urban blogs world-wide. Helping us to complete the series of ten books will  keep this public conversation going! and make an important contribution to the development of a self-confident and engaged South African public sphere.

What We Need & What You Get:
We need $25 000.00 in order to complete the next four books in the series:

Here is where your contribution will go: 

Book design $ 3,500.00

<h3>My Book Journey</h3>
<p><i>When Willows Weep</i> is a young adult fantasy novel about a twelve-year-old girl in the sixth grade who finds herself in the middle of an epic battle between good and evil. Using her three divine gifts of Sight, Light, and Fight, she must help defeat demonic forces threatening to destroy all that is good.<br/><br/>My name is Sherman Morrison and I am the author of <i>When Willows Weep</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to explore interesting intersections such as compassion and combat, faith and fantasy, ecology and education, redemption and rejection, all set in modern times with fantasy elements layered in.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will not only be entertained by the story, but also grapple with some of the questions it raises: Does everyone deserve redemption? How many chances do you give someone? What are the limits or boundaries of compassion? How would you react if you discovered you had special abilities and were expected to use them in an epic battle between good and evil?<br/><br/>Willow is twelve years old, loves her parents, and enjoys attending the Elm City Waldorf School in the small city of Keene, New Hampshire. Soon after discovering she has the divine gift of Sight, she becomes aware of a whole world most people don’t know about—a very real battle between the forces of light and demonic forces of darkness. She also learns of others who have divine gifts, including the pastor of the church she attends and her Waldorf teacher Mr. Retsof. There is also Dr. Sosserie, who takes on the task of training Willow in how to use a second divine gift she’s found to possess: Fight. When a third divine gift of Light emerges, Willow must join forces with other gifted people to protect and defend her school, the city, and the otherwise unseen fae folk from the demon Gehenna and her vast horde of hellhounds.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you enjoy fantasy novels in all their forms, but especially if you like fantasy set in modern times in the real world. <br/><br/><i>When Willows Weep</i> speaks to anyone who likes fantasy, those who are aligned with the Waldorf approach to education, and people of faith as well. How those all fit together in this story makes for a unique novel!<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope <i>When Willows Weep</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue about questions such as the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>What does true compassion look like and does everyone deserve it?</li>
<li>What role should education play in shaping the character of young people and care of the planet?</li>
<li>Can free will and destiny coexist?</li>
</ol>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing these themes and exploring these questions will change us all for the better. </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>editor</strong> I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in August 2021</li>
<li>The <strong>cover design</strong> of my book (the mockups you see currently are just temporary placeholders)</li>
<li>The <strong>layout design</strong> for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats, etc.)</li>
<li>The <strong>copy editing</strong> for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The <strong>launch &amp; promotion efforts</strong> for my book when I ultimately publish this summer</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook.<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will receive a personally signed paperback copy of my book when I publish.</li>
<li>Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.</li>
<li>You will receive early access to my <i>Note from the Author</i> and other excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback.</li>
<li>You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting the cover design for my book.</li>
<li>You will be invited to join my Author Community to get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.</li>
<li>And much more!</li>
</ul>
<h3>About the Author</h3>Sherman Morrison is a freelance writer and editor, published playwright, and now emerging novelist. When not clacking away on his laptop, he can usually be found found performing on stages throughout the Monadnock Region with a variety of community theatre groups. He also sings and occasionally preaches at the United Church of Christ in Keene, New Hampshire, which has been home base for him since moving to the area in 1996.<br/><br/>Sherman is the kind of person who likes to explore difficult topics and try to make sense of the more perplexing aspects of life. This is part of what his book is all about; exploring big questions through the eyes of a gifted twelve-year-old girl. The grandest adventure of his life, however, is parenting his daughter, Willow, who is also the direct inspiration for protagonist of the story. <br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Sherman Morrison by email at <a href=""mailto:gshm50@hotmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">gshm50@hotmail.com</a>, or send him a message through his website: <a href=""https://shermanmorrison.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://shermanmorrison.com​</a><br/> <p><strong>International Preorders</strong></p>For international preorders, please send me a private message.<br/> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier. <br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family, and network. Please use #WhenWillowsWeep and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so we can help amplify your efforts.</li>
<li>You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page.</li>
<li>Please share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it via text or direct message on social media.</li>

He also sings and occasionally preaches at the United Church of Christ in Keene, New Hampshire, which has been home base for him since moving to the area in 1996.Sherman is the kind of person who likes to explore difficult topics and try to make sense of the more perplexing aspects of life. This is part of what his book is all about; exploring big questions through the eyes of a gifted twelve-year-old girl. The grandest adventure of his life, however, is parenting his daughter, Willow, who is also the direct inspiration for protagonist of the story. For more information, you can connect with Sherman Morrison by email at gshm50@hotmail.com, or send him a message through his website: https://shermanmorrison.com​ International PreordersFor international preorders, please send me a private message. Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier. The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

<h2><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h2>
<p><i>The Iceberg Paradigm:</i> <i>Transforming Leadership through Systems Thinking for a Sustainable Future </i>is about understanding the roles of sustainability leaders, specifically Chief Sustainability Officers, and envisioning what these roles can mean for organizations, companies and governments in the future.</p>
<p>My name is Sade Bamimore and I am the author of <i>The Iceberg Paradigm: </i><i><i>T</i>ransforming Leadership through Systems Thinking for a Sustainable Future</i>. This is a working title and I wrote this book because, as someone who hopes to develop as a sustainability leader, I wanted to hear from current sustainability leaders today to get a full picture, across sectors, what it is that they do and how their roles have the power to transform sectors in the future.<br/><br/>My hope is that in reading this book you will discover how your own 'ecological self' can propel you towards action and servant leadership. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with systems thinking, escape the bystander effect and learn alongside sustainability leaders about the importance of elevating sustainability now.</p>
<p><br/>You will love this book if you like to be challenged and if you value the way self reflection plays a role in creating change. You will also love this book if you are generally curious about what sustainability is and want to know how current sustainability leaders are working to transform systems.<br/><br/><i>The Iceberg Paradigm: </i><i>Transforming Leadership through Systems Thinking for a Sustainable Future </i>speaks to both people within the sustainability field and outside of the sustainability field who want to grapple with defining leadership and organizational change in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that<i> The Iceberg Paradigm</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue around questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>If sustainability does not directly affect me or my career field, why should I care?</li>
<li>Does the topic of sustainability belong in the corporate world and/or public administration?</li>
<li>Climate change is a global issue, how can actions I take where I am located impact others beyond my community and around the world?</li>
<li>How can I help combat climate change and fight other forms of injustice?</li>
</ul>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing new forms of leadership will change us all for the better.<br/> <h3>The Book - <i>The Iceberg Paradigm: Transforming Leadership through Systems Thinking for a Sustainable Future</i>
</h3>
<p>The book is structured in four Parts.<br/><br/>Part I contains an introduction to sustainability, the current state of the world, and reasons why this book needs to be written. The readers of this book may vary in levels of understanding of sustainability conceptually. Part I will provide a common base of knowledge for readers to relate to the rest of the book.<br/><br/>Part II challenges the reader to take a theoretical approach and explore philosophy, psychology, politics and justice in relation to sustainability leadership.<br/><br/>Part III concerns the praxis of sustainability leadership. How can sustainability leadership be structurally implemented? How do sustainability efforts enable organizational change? Readers will hear from current sustainability leaders who discuss transformational leadership and systems thinking.<br/><br/>Part IV contains the concluding chapter and discusses themes related to the meaning of life, transcendence and ethics. Though titles can be important to elevate the importance of sustainability within the context of a company, organization or government, titles are not necessary to create a sustainability leader. What is needed is for each and every individual to take ownership of their environment and become sustainability leaders.</p>

On average, we spend 80,000 hours in our lifetime, working. That’s a lot of time to waste if you don’t find purpose in your work. I wrote this book because I wish I had a book like this to guide me through recreating my vocational life when I quit being a finance lawyer seven years ago.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the path to finding meaningful work that is your life purpose. I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for reinventing ourselves to launch impactful second careers beyond our wildest dreams. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you create an illuminating subsistence that lifts your soul as well as the world.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll hear stories such as...<ul>
<li>How to build the courage to quit a first career that looks successful from the outside but leaves you feeling completely empty on the inside.</li>
<li>Atypical entrepreneurial and life adventures on the hero’s and heroine’s journey .</li>
<li>Insider scoops in the purposeful work world - it is quite a parallel reality!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you want to make the shift into a more meaningful, career path. Be inspired! How big can you dream and how much impact can you really make in the world?<br/><br/><i>Your Next 40,000 Hours</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to career professionals who want to look at finding purposeful work and “how to change the world” (like, really) in a new way.</p>
<h2>The Book - Your Next 40,000 Hours</h2> The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + prologue + chapters 1-3. You've done well for yourself so far, but you're yearning for more in your next 40,000 hours. All of a sudden, you realise you're done climbing the first mountain of life that's all about building one’s identity and survival. It's inconvenient but the wakeup call is too loud to ignore. I've gone down many rabbit holes searching for ""purpose."" But what's that anyway? In part 1 of this book, get some clarity on what meaningful, high-impact vocational life looks like.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 4-6. The next question is ""how?"" For most seasoned career professionals, our basic instinct is to learn more. It doesn't help us here. In fact, we need to get comfortable with unlearning. More often than not, spiritual growth involves letting go instead of knowing more. In part 2 of this book, we gather the courage to quit, unsubscribe from limiting social conditioning, and unload baggage that no longer serves us in the second career we are trying to create.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 7-9 + epilogue. Now we are climbing the second mountain. It is not a walk in the park. Learn from the detours I and others have made, and the falls we've stood back up from. Most importantly, see for yourself why we all think it's worth it. There's no going back once you've experienced this bigger way of life. Open your mind, open your heart, go beyond. You need an illuminating subsistence as much as the world needs you to step up and bring light into darkness.<br/> <h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>
<li>The <strong>editor </strong>I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in August 2021.</li>

<li>The <strong>launch &amp; promotion efforts</strong> for my book when I ultimately publish this Summer.</li>
</ul>

<p>The original funding goal is set at $5,000 at which point I will have the costs covered to publish a paperback and ebook. The stretched goal is $8,000 where I can publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook too!</p>

And then ultimately I hope you can take away a greater appreciation for your journey through life and for others and be reminded that, no matter what, you are not alone.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you want something that will ground you in the beauty of humanity, if you feel alone or unconnected, or you enjoy poetry.<br/><br/><i>A Day of Humanity</i> is a poetry book that speaks to anyone who is looking to learn more about humanity and our connections to each other through real, beautiful stories.<h2> </h2>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Hi, welcome to my crowdfunding page for what will be Volume 1 of a trilogy.  People have been telling me for years that with my many experiences in life, good and bad, I really should put it all down on paper. To tell you the truth, I was a wee bit nervous about that as have never done anything like it before, but the wonderful response I got from people when I published a few excerpts on Facebook made me realise that maybe people do want to read my story after all.  Where we are: At the moment I have about 180,000 words written, which is going to pretty much be the first two volumes. What I need to do now is raise enough money to cover professional editing (have a great Scottish writer/editor on board already) and also an initial print run of first book. Money raised from sales of the first book will then help cover all the costs for books 2 &amp; 3.  Now I realise we live in the dark shadows of Tory austerity, and that many of us struggle to put a meal on the table some days, so I will say this once: if you can’t afford to donate, then please don’t, and also do not feel bad about it.  Below is a short synopsis of the book to give you an idea of what to expect.<br/> <br/>‘Definitely Maybe, Probably Not’ is the life story of James Toner, a story that spans almost five decades of his life and an amazing variety of experiences.  James’s story takes us from the housing schemes of Glasgow to a childhood in South Africa, and ends with him facing a long sentence in an Indian prison.  It is a story of crime and addiction, of change and recovery, of loss and acceptance. James was born in 1965 into a family from the Castlemilk area of Glasgow. His life changed when his dad decided to immigrate with the family to South Africa in 1973 to make a better life for his wife and two sons, James and his wee brother Martin. Life in South Africa was great, but it was all to fall apart. One morning, James woke to noises from the bathroom and found his mum, Agnes, huddled over his dad’s body. Joe Toner died the following day from a brain haemorrhage, and the family were heading back home to Castlemilk just over two weeks later. Two weeks that passed in a blur for James who has no memories of sadness or of missing his Father during that initial period.<br/>Back in Glasgow, ten-year-old James fitted back in to family life with his grandparents and the rest of the family. School was not a problem, but James found himself missing the dad he spent all his free time with and being constantly reminded he was now the man in the house, when in fact he was just a lost wee boy. As the years went by, James started to believe he was the big boss in his mum’s house, and that attitude, coupled with a new-found fondness for booze, turned him into someone who was always near chaos.  James’s new relationship with alcohol saw the police coming in and out of his life. His first taste of prison was in 1987 when he discovered that he had attachment, jealousy, and anger issues, and could be violent when he felt those feelings. It would take him many years to realise this though. Alcohol was never James`s friend.  Back in Castlemilk, James began selling stolen clothes on behalf of a friend called ‘The Squire’. This little scheme proved fairly lucrative for the pair, and it was perhaps inevitable that the next step was to sell cannabis. Thus James began on a journey of smuggling and selling drugs that would cover 25 years from 1985-2013, the year he walked free from an Indian court acquitted of all charges. <br/> <br/> <br/>These events would also see a spiralling journey through drug use and abuse; from the ecstasy use of the late 80s to mid-90s dance scene to the late 90s and early 00s heavier use of alcohol, crack cocaine, and prescription medications. Use and abuse that not even the birth of his only child Martin could stop. James takes us through over 2 decades of mayhem, mayhem he hated internally but didn’t know how to tackle. Mayhem which finally ended in 2001 when a fight in a club left him feeling suicidal and a friend took him to his first 12 step meeting and a turning point in his life.  12 Step fellwsand sobriety finally led James away from crime and into social work, and he felt a true calling in helping others. Life was great, but tragedy was to strike again when his brother Martin, due to stand trial on cocaine smuggling charges, was found murdered. Mayhem had returned. James takes us on an honest journey through the next 4 years of depression, broken relationships, cocaine use, and at least 2 breakdowns. James decides to run away, but doesn’t realise it’s from himself.  Six months travelling in India helps James and a friend fight their mental health issues. But on his return to Glasgow, James realises he is not quite finished running and returns to India in April of 2009. He now hates Glasgow with a passion: too many ghosts, too many demons, too many bad memories. With plans in his head as to how to fund his travels, he sees India as his bolt home from everything bad back home.  But within a month of returning to India, James walks into a police sting and is charged with being in possession of 2.75 kg of Cannabis with intent to supply. James had bought from a team of rogue police and spends the next eleven months in prison before those same police<br/>in his case are themselves arrested on charges relating to drugs and corruption. James is released on bail but his fight, and his struggle with his own mental health, is far from over.  With the complications and corruption endemic in the Indian justice system, James spends a further 3 years in Goa fighting his trial. Without the financial and moral support of friends from home, he would have never got through it.  James forges a friendship with Alan McGee, the man who discovered Oasis, and also find a new direction is esoteric practices, spirituality, and Buddhism, all of which help him cope with almost 100 court appearances in 3 years. Finally acquitted, James is at last reunited with his son and mum on 31st July 2013. He finally thinks his story is over. But 3 months later a bombshell drops when one of Martins ex-friends is charged with his murder. Douglas Fleming, a former policeman who had been Martin’s co-accused in the pending drug trial before his murder was charged with the crime. James is confused by it all: they have no new evidence so why this trial after ten years? The Toner family have to live through Martin’s death once again in a 6-week trial which ends with a Not Proven verdict and still no closure for Martin’s loved ones, who are left to and rebuild their lives with so many questions still unanswered. <br/> <br/>Throughout the story, James focuses on the 2 massive events that have affected his life; the death of his brother, and the lengthy and frustrating trial in India.  This is a tale of crime and punishment, of hope and despair, of dependency and the road to recovery, and finally of acceptance. There are parts which will make you laugh aloud, and there are parts which will make you cry. But Definitely Maybe, Probably Not will be one of the most moving books you will read this year....</p></div>","Hi, welcome to my crowdfunding page for what will be Volume 1 of a trilogy.  People have been telling me for years that with my many experiences in life, good and bad, I really should put it all down on paper.

<h3>UPDATE (July 8,2013): Octavia's Brood reached our initial goal today! Thank you all so much! Now we're going for our stretch goals: an expanded national tour, compensating writers, full color art in the book, and more! Please help us to keep spreading the word, and please keep contributing!</h3>
<p>Here is a short video about why you should keep contributing to Octavia's Brood: <a rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz-42HtB0gY</a></p>
<p><br/><em>Also in the media gallery here on indiegogo, you can see short videos from different Octavia's Brood writers talking about their stories and the larger project.</em></p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Greetings! We are Adrienne Maree Brown and Walidah Imarisha, two community organizers, educators, writers and self-proclaimed nerds. We have individually and collectively been working to bridge the visionary qualities of science/speculative fiction with radical community organizing practice.</p>
<p>We thought there was no better way to do this than with our current book project: <em>Octavia's Brood: Science Fiction Stories from Social Justice Movements. </em>It’s an anthology of radical science and speculative fiction written by organizers and activists.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
<p>We need to raise $8,277 to cover the cost of designing and printing the anthology (with a release date of summer 2014), as well as to fund a national tour where we will not only do readings of the anthology, but writing workshops and organizing strategy sessions where we can support communities turning their visionary ideas into concrete action!</p>
<p>We have received overwhelming support from everyone we tell about <em>Octavia’s Brood. </em>Because we believe in the principles of communities organizing and supporting themselves, we are turning to our strongest supporters and allies, our visionary community, to birth <em>Octavia’s Brood </em>into the world. </p>
<h3><strong>Stretch Goals</strong></h3>
<p>If we reach our $8,277 goal, <em>Octavia’s Brood</em> will come into being, and we have no doubt it will be incredible given the caliber of the stories we have. We can also begin the national tour with at least 3 cities.</p>
<p>But if we go over our initial goal, that money will not only be useful but can make this an even fuller and richer project that we feel will truly embody the spirit of Octavia Butler and move her legacy forward through us, her brood.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>REACHED!!! $8,277 – Main goal: <em>Octavia’s Brood </em>is published</strong></li>
<li><strong>REACHED!!!! $15,000 – Expanded 10 city tour</strong></li>
<li>This would enable us to bring the national tour to 10 cities - that includes not only book readings, but writing workshops, organizing strategy sessions, book club meetings and sci fi themed parties! For every $500 we raise, we’ll be able to add another city to the tour!</li>
<li>
<strong>$22,000 - Provide compensations writers and advisors</strong><br/> Everyone in this project right now is doing it for the love and because we are all inspired and excited about the project! But we would love to be able to create sustainable models of supporting artists to carry on this visionary work.</li>
<li>
<strong>$27,000 – – Color art and e-book</strong><br/> We want to make the book accessible to everyone and so want to develop an electronic version. We also want to include in full color the beautiful art (you can see some in our pitch videos) we have received, so we’re not reading the future, we are seeing it too!</li>
<li>
<strong>$32,000 – Expanded anthology</strong><br/> We are getting more incredible submissions than we originally thought, and rather than having to pick and choose which moving and inspiring short stories and essays, we want to give them all to you!</li>
<li><strong>$40,000 AND BEYOND – Expanded 25+ city tour</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For every $500 we raise, we’ll be able to add another city to the tour! So the sky’s the limit on how many places we can bring this project to!</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>In exchange, we are offering some amazing gifts, from not only us the editors but from the writers and our community: exclusive songs by visionary hip hop artists Invincible and Gabriel Teodros only available here; an unreleased science fiction story by one of our amazing writers; hang outs with <em>Octavia’s Brood </em>editors or writers (realworld or virtual!), and more!</p>
<p>And everyone who contributes anything, even $1, will get a thank you in the book for being part of our visionary community, and creating the space for us to re-envision our movements and the world around us.</p>

Now we're going for our stretch goals: an expanded national tour, compensating writers, full color art in the book, and more! Please help us to keep spreading the word, and please keep contributing!
Here is a short video about why you should keep contributing to Octavia's Brood: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz-42HtB0gY
Also in the media gallery here on indiegogo, you can see short videos from different Octavia's Brood writers talking about their stories and the larger project.
Short Summary
Greetings! We are Adrienne Maree Brown and Walidah Imarisha, two community organizers, educators, writers and self-proclaimed nerds. We have individually and collectively been working to bridge the visionary qualities of science/speculative fiction with radical community organizing practice.
We thought there was no better way to do this than with our current book project: Octavia's Brood: Science Fiction Stories from Social Justice Movements. It’s an anthology of radical science and speculative fiction written by organizers and activists.
What We Need
We need to raise $8,277 to cover the cost of designing and printing the anthology (with a release date of summer 2014), as well as to fund a national tour where we will not only do readings of the anthology, but writing workshops and organizing strategy sessions where we can support communities turning their visionary ideas into concrete action!
We have received overwhelming support from everyone we tell about Octavia’s Brood. Because we believe in the principles of communities organizing and supporting themselves, we are turning to our strongest supporters and allies, our visionary community, to birth Octavia’s Brood into the world. 
Stretch Goals
If we reach our $8,277 goal, Octavia’s Brood will come into being, and we have no doubt it will be incredible given the caliber of the stories we have. We can also begin the national tour with at least 3 cities.
But if we go over our initial goal, that money will not only be useful but can make this an even fuller and richer project that we feel will truly embody the spirit of Octavia Butler and move her legacy forward through us, her brood.

REACHED!!! $8,277 – Main goal: Octavia’s Brood is published

This would enable us to bring the national tour to 10 cities - that includes not only book readings, but writing workshops, organizing strategy sessions, book club meetings and sci fi themed parties! For every $500 we raise, we’ll be able to add another city to the tour!

$22,000 - Provide compensations writers and advisors Everyone in this project right now is doing it for the love and because we are all inspired and excited about the project! But we would love to be able to create sustainable models of supporting artists to carry on this visionary work.

$27,000 – – Color art and e-book We want to make the book accessible to everyone and so want to develop an electronic version. We also want to include in full color the beautiful art (you can see some in our pitch videos) we have received, so we’re not reading the future, we are seeing it too!

He left behind his place of birth, Mantua, crossed  Balkan Europe that was being shaken by the winds of war, stopping for a while in Constantinople (capital city of the Ottoman Empire) . From there, he journeyed on to reach the city of Arabian Nights, the mythical Baghdad.</p><p>Heartbroken by his sweetheart’s parents’ refusal to let her marry him (because of his lack of means and social status), he set off on his journey, filled with a determination to show the world what he was made of. This led Grandfather Fernando to the role of War Correspondent, or ‘Travelling Editor’ as they called them in those days, but without any credentials in the form of ‘papers or qualifications’ that he didn’t possess.</p><blockquote><p>Aware of his own ignorance, he decided to gain an education by signing up to the largest of all universities, the only one that might welcome him without qualifications: the University of Life,  the mother of gypsies and travellers, who welcomed him with open arms amongst her many, desperate sons.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>He set out on the road, like so many Italians then and like so many people from every part of the world even today, to search for a better life for himself and a better story to tell his children.</p><blockquote><p> Turning his face to the rising sun, his soul buoyed up by dreams, he tackled the road, white and dusty in the ice of a Lombardy February morning. And there he learnt many things, as the road revealed so many of life’s secrets. While there, he learnt obscure, guttural languages, new customs and unknown religions.  The road showed him things that he had never seen before.</p></blockquote><p></p><p>I found out how he lived, recorded in his diaries, in his letters and in various documents, in an old trunk. Piece by piece, I was able to reconstruct a clear account of hope and dreams, of adventures and of his love for his family and homeland.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1255732/files/20150228055308-baule15_0024.jpg?1425131588"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p>Along with this intriguing story, however, Grandfather Fernando also left behind him a number of mysteries, so I have decided that the only way to find out the answers is to follow the trail that he left.</p><p>Probably, after all this time, so many places have changed, the names written on the pages of the diary have faded and the facts written down seem to be a stretch of the imagination. But I want to tell his story and find my answers!</p><p>And I would like to do it having seen what he saw and felt what he felt!</p>However, being currently out of work, I really do feel like he did when he set out. When will I ever have another moment like this? Surely now is the right time to leave.<p></p><h3>The departure</h3><p>I mentioned what I wanted to do to my wife, Lucia, who (unpredictably) replied: “Go now! If not now, when...?”</p><p>I was somewhat disorientated: What to do? How to organize it? Where to go? Who to contact?</p><p>One way or another, however, I will be leaving on the 15th March 2015.</p><p>I will be travelling from Mantua, following the same road described by Grandfather, sadly having to stop in Constantinople (Istanbul) because of the current situation in the Middle East.</p>Travelling alongside me will be Fabrizio Annibali, a professional photographer, who has the ability to make pictures talk and to tell incredible stories with the images he snaps around the world. What better travelling companion for an adventure like this?<p></p><h3>The Project</h3><div style=""float: right;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1229263/files/20150217135305-letter15_0104a.jpg?1424209985"" src="""" style=""width: 184.98px; height: 476px; margin-left: 5px;""/></div><p>The idea behind this project is to create a book in which you can enjoy a mixture of the pages of Grandfather Fernando, the first-hand experiences of the era and our pursuit, 100 years later. Not a travel guide like so many others, but a mix of notes, quotes and photos of the past and present: a sort of scrap book, a travel album, created on our travels.</p><p>It will function as a time machine to join two worlds, two eras, two men, or maybe more. It will make things that appeared very diverse actually seem more similar than you would have thought possible, and it will bear testament to the fact that people everywhere are always the same: priceless and unique!</p><p>There have been numerous changes in communication, travelling and writing, but even after 100 years the dreams, the hopes and the feelings of these people are still the same.</p><p>However, to make this dream come true, I need your help. I need to raise some money for the journey and to find an old car capable of taking me to Istanbul, so that I can create, edit and publish the book on my return.</p><h3>How to follow the journey</h3><p>If you are unable to contribute financially - and no-one understands that better than me at this moment - it doesn’t mean you can’t help. I would really appreciate it if you could share this campaign on Facebook or Twitter or send it to any of your contacts who might be interested in the project. For us, it will be very important just to know that you are there for us and that you are joining in the journey, following our adventure as we trace the footsteps of Grandfather Fernando.</p><p>You can follow our journey directly on <a href=""https://twitter.com/StoryCityMi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> and on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/comitatostorycity"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a>; we will also be keeping a diary of this journey, which you can read on our <a href=""http://www.storycity.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website StoryCity</a>.

He left behind his place of birth, Mantua, crossed  Balkan Europe that was being shaken by the winds of war, stopping for a while in Constantinople (capital city of the Ottoman Empire) . From there, he journeyed on to reach the city of Arabian Nights, the mythical Baghdad.Heartbroken by his sweetheart’s parents’ refusal to let her marry him (because of his lack of means and social status), he set off on his journey, filled with a determination to show the world what he was made of. This led Grandfather Fernando to the role of War Correspondent, or ‘Travelling Editor’ as they called them in those days, but without any credentials in the form of ‘papers or qualifications’ that he didn’t possess.Aware of his own ignorance, he decided to gain an education by signing up to the largest of all universities, the only one that might welcome him without qualifications: the University of Life,  the mother of gypsies and travellers, who welcomed him with open arms amongst her many, desperate sons.He set out on the road, like so many Italians then and like so many people from every part of the world even today, to search for a better life for himself and a better story to tell his children. Turning his face to the rising sun, his soul buoyed up by dreams, he tackled the road, white and dusty in the ice of a Lombardy February morning. And there he learnt many things, as the road revealed so many of life’s secrets. While there, he learnt obscure, guttural languages, new customs and unknown religions.  The road showed him things that he had never seen before.I found out how he lived, recorded in his diaries, in his letters and in various documents, in an old trunk. Piece by piece, I was able to reconstruct a clear account of hope and dreams, of adventures and of his love for his family and homeland.Along with this intriguing story, however, Grandfather Fernando also left behind him a number of mysteries, so I have decided that the only way to find out the answers is to follow the trail that he left.Probably, after all this time, so many places have changed, the names written on the pages of the diary have faded and the facts written down seem to be a stretch of the imagination. But I want to tell his story and find my answers!And I would like to do it having seen what he saw and felt what he felt!However, being currently out of work, I really do feel like he did when he set out. When will I ever have another moment like this? Surely now is the right time to leave.The departureI mentioned what I wanted to do to my wife, Lucia, who (unpredictably) replied: “Go now! If not now, when...?”I was somewhat disorientated: What to do? How to organize it? Where to go? Who to contact?One way or another, however, I will be leaving on the 15th March 2015.I will be travelling from Mantua, following the same road described by Grandfather, sadly having to stop in Constantinople (Istanbul) because of the current situation in the Middle East.Travelling alongside me will be Fabrizio Annibali, a professional photographer, who has the ability to make pictures talk and to tell incredible stories with the images he snaps around the world. What better travelling companion for an adventure like this?The ProjectThe idea behind this project is to create a book in which you can enjoy a mixture of the pages of Grandfather Fernando, the first-hand experiences of the era and our pursuit, 100 years later. Not a travel guide like so many others, but a mix of notes, quotes and photos of the past and present: a sort of scrap book, a travel album, created on our travels.It will function as a time machine to join two worlds, two eras, two men, or maybe more. It will make things that appeared very diverse actually seem more similar than you would have thought possible, and it will bear testament to the fact that people everywhere are always the same: priceless and unique!There have been numerous changes in communication, travelling and writing, but even after 100 years the dreams, the hopes and the feelings of these people are still the same.However, to make this dream come true, I need your help. I need to raise some money for the journey and to find an old car capable of taking me to Istanbul, so that I can create, edit and publish the book on my return.How to follow the journeyIf you are unable to contribute financially - and no-one understands that better than me at this moment - it doesn’t mean you can’t help. I would really appreciate it if you could share this campaign on Facebook or Twitter or send it to any of your contacts who might be interested in the project. For us, it will be very important just to know that you are there for us and that you are joining in the journey, following our adventure as we trace the footsteps of Grandfather Fernando.You can follow our journey directly on Twitter and on Facebook; we will also be keeping a diary of this journey, which you can read on our website StoryCity. We will be telling the story as if we were sat around a camp fire with all our friends and supporters.Last but not least, we also need help finding friendly, cheap places to sleep and eat and also (why not?) any suggestions on beautiful things to discover along the way. Helpful travel advice is also very welcome!I still have many doubts that I will be sharing with you during this adventure. Maybe you can help me find the answers.And afterwards?We will eventually  arrive at Istanbul (Constantinople) but the story carries on: Grandfather Fernando journeyed on to Syria and then travelled on foot across the deserts between Damascus and Aleppo. Then, yet further, to Baghdad from where he returned to join up as a volunteer in the Great War.If you enjoy our travels to Istanbul, we will also complete the second part of the journey from Constantinople to Baghdad and then we will follow Grandfather into the trenches of the First World War and beyond!ItalianoCirca 100 anni fa mio nonno Fernando partì, senza neanche il passaporto, per un lungo viaggio che lo portò da Mantova fino a Baghdad.

<h3>My Story</h3>This could be the story of a woman with a serious drawing impediment but, it's not (quite). <br/>It's the story of a recent survivor of stage IV colon cancer...my story.  I went through a long and bumpy road to get here but, I made it to the other side and am eagerly greeting my second lease on life~<br/><br/>There are so many things I've learned along the way which have made me all the stronger and wiser but, I wish someone had handed me a guide on day 1 and saved me the trouble of learning some things the hard way.<br/><br/>This book is just that, an insider guide for someone newly diagnosed with cancer and for those who love them and want to help but, don't know where the !&amp;%# to start. <br/><br/>You'll laugh, you'll cry, then you'll laugh while you're crying and best of all my short attention span theater fans...you'll be able to read it all in a day (about 80 pages). <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Look for excerpts on the facebook fan page...</span><br/><br/>Look, see there on the right...?  Make a $30 contribution and get your advanced/autographed copy of the book before it launches on Amazon or $100 and get a personal thank you and your name printed in the book!<br style=""text-decoration: underline;""/><br/><h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>
</div><div>
<p>According to the American Cancer Society, over 7 million people in the 
world die of cancer every year.  I think that's just f'd up and needs to
 change, today...</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign you will be helping to give people an alternative to an otherwise grave and dramatic view of cancer and offering them an insightful way of dealing with it.<br/></p>
<p>Also, once its published, a portion of all sales will go to established non-profit organizations that support those struggling with the costs of cancer treatment and you'll be able to follow that progress with quarterly updates on our website: <a href=""http://www.theccardandme.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.theccardandme.com</a>.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Funding for the publishing and marketing of the book, that's what we need pure and simple.  After researching further I found that Amazon/Createspace had the best deal and cut the cost of publishing in half from my original estimate.  They were really helpful and broke it down in a way that was easy for me and my chemo brain to soak in: $1,180 to edit/format/publish the book, $69 to make it available on Kindle then $600 to market it (press releases to over 1,000 TV/radio/magazines with that interest) with an estimate of 10 weeks from the time we start the editing process on February 17th, 2012 to it being on Amazon's virtual shelf (and autographed copies are in the hands of contributors just prior).<br/></p>
<p>I could submit it to publishers and wait months on end for one to see its merit and take action but, I think of all those diagnosed with cancer every day and how their heads are reeling and I just don't want to wait for this to be in their hands.<br/></p>
<p>By contributing anywhere between $30 and $1,000 or more, you'll become a Card Carrying Member with an autographed copy of the book and the satisfaction of being part of a movement to relegate this little punk-ass disease to the lower ranks and recesses of all our minds and lives.</p>
<p><br/></p>What If We Surpass the Goal?<br/><p>It means we'll be able to extend the reach of the book by having it available in bookstores,  through further marketing and make it available in several other languages throughout the world.  C'est Magnifique!<br/></p>

It's the story of a recent survivor of stage IV colon cancer...my story.  I went through a long and bumpy road to get here but, I made it to the other side and am eagerly greeting my second lease on life~There are so many things I've learned along the way which have made me all the stronger and wiser but, I wish someone had handed me a guide on day 1 and saved me the trouble of learning some things the hard way.This book is just that, an insider guide for someone newly diagnosed with cancer and for those who love them and want to help but, don't know where the !&%# to start. You'll laugh, you'll cry, then you'll laugh while you're crying and best of all my short attention span theater fans...you'll be able to read it all in a day (about 80 pages). Look for excerpts on the facebook fan page...Look, see there on the right...?  Make a $30 contribution and get your advanced/autographed copy of the book before it launches on Amazon or $100 and get a personal thank you and your name printed in the book!The Impact


According to the American Cancer Society, over 7 million people in the 
world die of cancer every year.  I think that's just f'd up and needs to
 change, today...
By contributing to this campaign you will be helping to give people an alternative to an otherwise grave and dramatic view of cancer and offering them an insightful way of dealing with it.
Also, once its published, a portion of all sales will go to established non-profit organizations that support those struggling with the costs of cancer treatment and you'll be able to follow that progress with quarterly updates on our website: www.theccardandme.com.


What We Need & What You Get
Funding for the publishing and marketing of the book, that's what we need pure and simple.  After researching further I found that Amazon/Createspace had the best deal and cut the cost of publishing in half from my original estimate.  They were really helpful and broke it down in a way that was easy for me and my chemo brain to soak in: $1,180 to edit/format/publish the book, $69 to make it available on Kindle then $600 to market it (press releases to over 1,000 TV/radio/magazines with that interest) with an estimate of 10 weeks from the time we start the editing process on February 17th, 2012 to it being on Amazon's virtual shelf (and autographed copies are in the hands of contributors just prior).
I could submit it to publishers and wait months on end for one to see its merit and take action but, I think of all those diagnosed with cancer every day and how their heads are reeling and I just don't want to wait for this to be in their hands.
By contributing anywhere between $30 and $1,000 or more, you'll become a Card Carrying Member with an autographed copy of the book and the satisfaction of being part of a movement to relegate this little punk-ass disease to the lower ranks and recesses of all our minds and lives.
What If We Surpass the Goal?It means we'll be able to extend the reach of the book by having it available in bookstores,  through further marketing and make it available in several other languages throughout the world.  C'est Magnifique!

When this is over, you will understand that there is a PURPOSE to all of this, the end result of which will be <b>A MULTIMEDIA PROJECT EVENT</b> that will utilize video, music, prose, satirical cartoons and illustrations to capture the torment that I have been put through by the banking system, mortgage holders, employees thereof and more while trying to save my childhood home from what is, for all intent and purposes, an illegal foreclosure.</p><p></p><p>This fundraiser is called <b>THE PLIGHT OF THE COMMON MAN</b>, which is designed to raise money to save my home, located here in Largo, Florida. Obviously a project very near and dear to my heart.</p><p></p><p><b>TO GIVE YOU SOME BACKGROUND ON HOW ALL THIS CAME TO BE:</b></p><p></p><p>I grew up in this home, which my mother bought as it was built in 1973. We are the only family that has ever lived in the home. My mother was a widow, my dad having died when I was four. After dad died, my grandma - mom's mom - moved in to help mom take care of me so that mom could work. At the time we moved into the house, I was ten years old.</p><p></p><p>I was 19 when I moved out to marry my first wife. I began working for a comic book store chain in October 1982. I bought the Largo, Florida store on December 1st, 1992, and have continued to run my comic book store ever since, through good times and bad. For four years, I was also a substitute teacher, from 2002 - 2006.</p><p></p><p>Grandma lived with mom in the home after I grew up and moved out. She passed away in the home at age 93 on September 12, 2000. Mom developed lung disease in 2001. By 2003, she was in need of assistance. Mom's lung disease became terminal in 2006. She passed away at home at age 77 on February 6, 2007. I was caregiver to them both in their final years.</p><p></p><p>I was dismissed by the Pinellas County School Board from my substitute teaching position in June 2007 for failing to work as a sub during my mother's final few months, from 2006-2007. After Mom passed, I had to deal with her estate, and I was very emotional. I planned to return to subbing in August of 2007, but the school board refused to hold my position.</p><p></p><p>I moved into the home shortly after mom passed away, in April 2007. The house went through the probate process as part of her estate. By summer of 2007, the house was then put into my name. I had picked up making the mortgage payments when mom died, and continued straight through UNTIL, in May of 2009, I received a letter from the bank -- which was Wachovia at the time -- stating that my mortgage had gone from the $525.00 a month payment to $983.00 due to an escrow shortage. I immediately called the bank, who informed me that the escrow shortage was related to either property taxes or homeowner's insurance.</p><p></p><p>I then began to pursue a plan to refinance the mortgage, but Wachovia's representative stated that they would not allow me to do that, but that I had to do a Loan Modification instead. I didn't know what that was. They told me to write a hardship letter, and told me what to say IN the hardship letter, and to call them back the next day. Meanwhile, they would mail out a Loan Modification package to me. After that call, I spoke to an attorney friend who said yes, Loan Modifications are the thing to do these days. Remember, this was summer of 2009. My accountant said he was doing five of them at the time for clients. This made me feel more secure about moving forward, but I still felt that a refi would have been simpler and safer to do.</p><p></p><p>But Wachovia was the bank, and they held all the cards.</p><p></p><p>When we began the Loan Modification process, I was told that they would be canceling my old account number and assigning my mortgage a NEW account number. When I asked how I would make payments, they said that until the Loan Modification process was complete, I would have no payments. Once it was complete, I would receive a coupon booklet, and have 30 days to make the payments. I would then have to make the payments on time, each month, or would be dropped from the program.</p><p></p><p>I asked if I would be in default. They said no, I would not be in default throughout this process. I asked what happened to the payments I wasn't making. They said all payments, taxes and insurance would be put ""on the back end"". I asked if there were any penalties, and again, they replied in the negative. There were no fees, fines or penalties because I was doing a Loan Modification.</p><p></p><p>Again, they were the lender. They held all the cards. So I had to believe them, didn't I?</p><p></p><p>I followed through, receiving and returning documents with my accountant's assistance. This process went on for months. Just as I was wondering when the Loan Modification would be approved, in January 2010, I was contacted by Wells Fargo, who had taken over Wachovia. They said that they were canceling my Loan Modification BUT they were putting me in the *new and improved* President's Loan Modification Plan. They made it sound like a sure bet, no problem making it go through, and once again, we had to resubmit all-new forms.</p><p></p><p>Again, I asked them about making payments, and they reiterated: I would have no payments during the Loan Modification process. Likewise, I would not be in default, with all payments, taxes and insurance would be put ""on the back end"". There would be no fees, fines or penalties because I was doing a Loan Modification.</p><p></p><p>Now it was Wells Fargo holding all the cards, but again, shouldn't I trust them? After all, if all they want is for me to be a current mortgage holder, then this process was the way to go, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>My accountant assured me, ""They have enough houses in foreclosure, Pat. They don't want your home.""</p><p></p><p>With his help, I once again threw myself into the process of the Loan Modification machine.</p><p></p><p>Around this time, my friend the attorney, who specializes in family law, said, ""Have Wells Fargo fax me a letter stating the terms they've told you. You should have all that in writing.""</p><p></p><p>So I called the guy I'd spoken to, who said that he ""couldn't fax anything out of the office"".</p><p></p><p>I said, ""What are you talking about, you can't fax? Then e-mail him a letter.""</p><p></p><p>The guy replied, ""Oh no, we can't e-mail out of these offices either.""</p><p></p><p>I told the attorney what the Wells Fargo rep said, and he replied, ""Call him back and have him contact the mortgage department and make SURE they don't put you in foreclosure!""</p><p></p><p>""But,"" I said, ""I'm not even in default!"" The attorney was adamant, so I did as instructed.</p><p></p><p>The Wells Fargo rep replied, ""Oh no, we can't contact that department, we don't have the ability to contact any department outside our own!""</p><p></p><p>""What are you talking about, aren't you ALL Wells Fargo?"" He said yes, but ""the system"" wasn't set up to allow them to speak to the other departments.</p><p></p><p>Now, you're all saying what everyone else does at this point. Wasn't I suspicious? Didn't this send up red flags? Sure it did! But Wells Fargo was the new lender, and now it was they who held all the cards! What was I supposed to do, call them all liars?</p><p></p><p>This process went on and on and on -- throughout the entire year of 2010, and through 2011 until September of that year. Throughout that entire time, we would be told that the paperwork had expired, ""grown stale"", and told to resubmit, resubmit, resubmit some more, which we did ad nauseum. We did everything we were told to do. What else were we SUPPOSED to do?</p><p></p><p>From January 2010 until September 2011, I was traded off from one Home Preservation ""Specialist"" to another, each one coming across like nothing more than a glorified telemarketer. In September 2011, the third of these ""specialists"" sent me a letter, denying my Loan Modification -- after over TWO years of being jerked around, claiming that my Profit and Loss statement (for my comic store) was insufficient.</p><p></p><p>By the 28th of September, Wells Fargo had filed a foreclosure against me, and mailed me the paperwork so that it arrived ON my birthday, October 1st, 2011. I spent the day crying.</p><p></p><p>With the help of my attorney friend, I filed a counter against their foreclosure, but was forced to hire an attorney in the beginning of 2012 -- Stamatakis + Thalji + Bonanno -- in Tampa, recommended to my accountant, who passed that information along to me. I gave them a retainer, and they began the process of filing motions to dismiss, among other motions. This point-counterpoint went back and forth without anyone gaining ground for two years. Every so often, we'd hear from them that motions were being filed, but that everything was the same. No change.</p><p></p><p>Here's where things take a BAD TURN, and it all started with -- a wedding!</p><p></p><p>By this point in my life, 2011-2014, I had a girlfriend -- Ashley -- whom I met in the latter days near the end of my first marriage when she began helping out at the comic shop, taking over for the fellow who was moving away, while I was busy taking care of Mom before she died.  After my first wife and I separated again in 2007, Ashley and I became more and more involved, first as friends before becoming near inseparable companions. We have almost everything in common, and our differences in interests are negligible and endearing. My divorce of my first marriage was final December 1st, 2011. Ashley and I became engaged on Christmas Day 2012, almost 13 months later.</p><p></p><p>We envisioned growing older in that house -- she's younger than I am, and would like children of her own -- and spoke of having a family of our own there in my childhood home. I thought of how happy that would have made Mom and Grandma, to bring the joy of a full-on family back to the house. My children are all grown, and I really like the idea of having a second chance to be a dad again. When my first wife and I were married -- very young -- I admit with deep  regret that I was far more self-centered and self-absorbed than I am now. I was a good dad, mind you -- never went out with the boys, or played golf or sports, nor was I abusive in any way -- but I was *a real couch potato*, coming in after work to watch my TV shows, eat dinner, and do my own thing. I regret not spending more time with my kids, other than to help them with homework and read to them sometimes before bedtime. I would love to have a second chance to be a better dad. I can't make up the lost time to my adult children -- I wish I could, because I love them with all my heart -- but I know I'm a better man today than I was when I was younger.</p><p></p><p>Ashley has gone back to college to become an RN, and is currently taking courses. As of December 2014, she has about 18 months remaining before she will have her Associates in Science degree and her RN license.</p><p></p><p>Of course, as couples do, Ashley and I began tossing wedding dates back and forth when we might like to get married. The one date which came up was February 22nd, because that was my Grandma's birthday. It wasn't until I learned that my Dad's parents were also married on February 22nd that I really got that date stuck in my head. It seemed so perfect, to honor my parents and grandparents. I left it up to Ashley, however, because I'd already been married before, and had my big day. She had ideas how we'd proceed with a big ceremony, but felt that we could renew our vows in a big ceremony someday later, when so many things had been sorted out -- not the least of which was the house -- but that we could have a civil ceremony on February 22nd of 2014 because the day fell on a Saturday. It won't fall on a Saturday for six more years, and we didn't want to wait six years for that date to be our wedding anniversary.</p><p></p><p>The entire thing came together in three days, from the day we just spontaneously decided to have our wedding to the date of the wedding. BUT before we did anything, we called the attorneys for the foreclosure defense, because we didn't want ANYTHING to upset the process. The attorney replied, ""All this will mean is, when we get into the Loan Modification phase, Ashley will need to provide some proof of income! Otherwise, your getting married won't change a thing!""</p><p></p><p><b>WRONG.</b></p><p></p><p>We married as we'd hurriedly planned on February 22nd, filing our license with the Clerk of the Court for Pinellas County, Florida a couple of days later. We were so happy and excited!</p><p></p><p>A couple of months went by. Suddenly, around the end of April, a persistent person kept coming to the house in the mornings, knocking loudly, then leaving and driving away. Well, we're at the comic book store often working late doing paperwork, because that's when it's quiet and Ashley has college classes, as I mentioned earlier. So we're not dressed early in the morning. This went on until the beginning of May, when the person hid his car down the road, and then hid in the neighbor's bushes. Ashley was walking to the car around noon, so we could head to the store. I was just inside the door. The man jumped out, ran across the yard, and served Ashley a set of the foreclosure papers. He began interrogating her, asking her who she was, what business she had at the house and so forth. She had no idea at that moment who he was or what the papers were, so she refused to answer. He ran away as I came out, jumping into his car to speed off.</p><p></p><p>We were then notified in June 2014 that a hearing had been scheduled for August to set a sale date for the house, to force the foreclosure process through to the ultimate conclusion.</p><p></p><p>The attorney told us that we could do one of two things: file for a new Loan Modification, which he could do for $500.00, or file for Bankruptcy Chapter 13 for $1,500.00. He said these would stop the foreclosure process and cancel the hearing. We opted for the Loan Modification process. He then said we'd have to do the Bankruptcy instead, but it was a 1 to 5 year process. I *believed* I understood the idea was to discharge debt while improving my debt-to-income ratio, because I knew that term from having done a refinance with my first wife on our old house back in 2004. So I *thought* I understood what was going on now, and hey -- 1 to 5 years? Ashley would be an RN in less than 2 years, so I thought everything would be fine.</p><p></p><p><b>WRONG.</b></p><p></p><p>I was scouring a lot of avenues trying to come up with the $1,500.00 when I wrote a very good friend of mine for advice. In turn, he said, ""I'm going to loan you the money to save your house"", and God bless him, I still owe him that money (I haven't forgotten), because he DID come through for me!!</p><p></p><p>We contacted the attorney to get him the fifteen hundred, who said, ""Well, we'll need another $310.00 for filing fees."" We had an additional $200.00, so they agreed to take that. All in all, we gave them $1,700.00 for the Bankruptcy which I *thought* I understood, and clearly did NOT. After they were paid, the attorney was able to stop the foreclosure -- don't cheer yet! It was only temporary -- and call off the hearing with days to spare. THEN he dropped the bombshell, we'd meet with a Bankruptcy trustee within a week, and 30 days later -- by the first of October -- we'd have to start paying TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH to stay in the house. If we couldn't agree to that, we wouldn't be able to stay in the house!</p><p></p><p>Why was the monthly amount so high when the Loan Modification -- if it had just gone through originally as planned -- should have reduced the monthly payment from the $983.00 down to around $550.00? Because Wells Fargo has added FEES, PENALTIES, LEGAL FEES, COURT COSTS and MORE to the tune of $50,000.00 on top of the original $82,000.00 mortgage, PLUS tacked on an extra $5,000.00 onto the original mortgage!!</p><p></p><p>Therefore, to get out from under, if I have to pay the entire sum, I'd have to give them $137,000.00!!</p><p></p><p>Obviously, we couldn't agree to do $2,000.00 a month, no matter how much I want to stay in my house. I knew I couldn't come up with that kind of money. The trustee then released the bankruptcy, the foreclosure process began again, and a NEW HEARING is set for December 16, 2014.  Yes, NEXT WEEK!!!!</p><p></p><p><b>Merry Christmas.</b></p><p></p><p>We spoke to HUD and looked into the HAMP and HARP programs. After getting a good deal of run around, which left me reduced to tears -- yes, I'm a man, standing in my comic book store, weeping over my boyhood home -- we were told to ""approach the lender and start a new Loan Modification"".</p><p></p><p>Again, we approached the attorney: ""What about the Loan Modification you mentioned?""</p><p></p><p>They replied: ""We can do that for $500.00, but the hearing will still go through, and a sale date will be set for your house. Or you can do the Loan Modification yourself.""</p><p></p><p>We asked: ""Can you take $500.00 from the $1,700.00 we already gave you?""</p><p></p><p>The answer: ""No, that money is already spent.""</p><p></p><p>So we called Wells Fargo ourselves. The woman we spoke to was nice enough. She said to go to a particular page and download the Loan Modification package. She also mailed us one. She said that the hearing against the house could be canceled and the foreclosure stopped before Thanksgiving. Get the paperwork filled out, send it in, and they would call to do a financial interview. I was excited beyond words. Finally, a chance to breathe!</p><p></p><p>We got the forms, sent them to the accountant, met with him, and he got the forms back to us. This took two weeks of going back and forth -- he also has other clients, I understand that -- and then we called HUD to go over the numbers with THEM before sending the package to Wells Fargo. HUD said it all met the criteria for a successful Loan Modification!</p><p></p><p>Okay, we called Wells Fargo. They said, ""Don't e-mail them, FAX them"" and then directed us to go to the branch near us and fax the papers from there. We did this on November 21st, 2014. We then expected the call from Wells Fargo.</p><p></p><p><b>WRONG.</b></p><p></p><p>There was no call. So WE called. They didn't know who Ashley had spoken to. We said we needed to do the interview.

My name is Patrick Potter, and I am coming to you with a very unusual fundraiser. When this is over, you will understand that there is a PURPOSE to all of this, the end result of which will be A MULTIMEDIA PROJECT EVENT that will utilize video, music, prose, satirical cartoons and illustrations to capture the torment that I have been put through by the banking system, mortgage holders, employees thereof and more while trying to save my childhood home from what is, for all intent and purposes, an illegal foreclosure.This fundraiser is called THE PLIGHT OF THE COMMON MAN, which is designed to raise money to save my home, located here in Largo, Florida. Obviously a project very near and dear to my heart.TO GIVE YOU SOME BACKGROUND ON HOW ALL THIS CAME TO BE:I grew up in this home, which my mother bought as it was built in 1973. We are the only family that has ever lived in the home. My mother was a widow, my dad having died when I was four. After dad died, my grandma - mom's mom - moved in to help mom take care of me so that mom could work. At the time we moved into the house, I was ten years old.I was 19 when I moved out to marry my first wife. I began working for a comic book store chain in October 1982. I bought the Largo, Florida store on December 1st, 1992, and have continued to run my comic book store ever since, through good times and bad. For four years, I was also a substitute teacher, from 2002 - 2006.Grandma lived with mom in the home after I grew up and moved out. She passed away in the home at age 93 on September 12, 2000. Mom developed lung disease in 2001. By 2003, she was in need of assistance. Mom's lung disease became terminal in 2006. She passed away at home at age 77 on February 6, 2007. I was caregiver to them both in their final years.I was dismissed by the Pinellas County School Board from my substitute teaching position in June 2007 for failing to work as a sub during my mother's final few months, from 2006-2007. After Mom passed, I had to deal with her estate, and I was very emotional. I planned to return to subbing in August of 2007, but the school board refused to hold my position.I moved into the home shortly after mom passed away, in April 2007. The house went through the probate process as part of her estate. By summer of 2007, the house was then put into my name. I had picked up making the mortgage payments when mom died, and continued straight through UNTIL, in May of 2009, I received a letter from the bank -- which was Wachovia at the time -- stating that my mortgage had gone from the $525.00 a month payment to $983.00 due to an escrow shortage. I immediately called the bank, who informed me that the escrow shortage was related to either property taxes or homeowner's insurance.I then began to pursue a plan to refinance the mortgage, but Wachovia's representative stated that they would not allow me to do that, but that I had to do a Loan Modification instead. I didn't know what that was. They told me to write a hardship letter, and told me what to say IN the hardship letter, and to call them back the next day. Meanwhile, they would mail out a Loan Modification package to me. After that call, I spoke to an attorney friend who said yes, Loan Modifications are the thing to do these days. Remember, this was summer of 2009. My accountant said he was doing five of them at the time for clients. This made me feel more secure about moving forward, but I still felt that a refi would have been simpler and safer to do.But Wachovia was the bank, and they held all the cards.When we began the Loan Modification process, I was told that they would be canceling my old account number and assigning my mortgage a NEW account number. When I asked how I would make payments, they said that until the Loan Modification process was complete, I would have no payments. Once it was complete, I would receive a coupon booklet, and have 30 days to make the payments. I would then have to make the payments on time, each month, or would be dropped from the program.I asked if I would be in default. They said no, I would not be in default throughout this process. I asked what happened to the payments I wasn't making. They said all payments, taxes and insurance would be put ""on the back end"". I asked if there were any penalties, and again, they replied in the negative. There were no fees, fines or penalties because I was doing a Loan Modification.Again, they were the lender. They held all the cards. So I had to believe them, didn't I?I followed through, receiving and returning documents with my accountant's assistance. This process went on for months. Just as I was wondering when the Loan Modification would be approved, in January 2010, I was contacted by Wells Fargo, who had taken over Wachovia. They said that they were canceling my Loan Modification BUT they were putting me in the *new and improved* President's Loan Modification Plan. They made it sound like a sure bet, no problem making it go through, and once again, we had to resubmit all-new forms.Again, I asked them about making payments, and they reiterated: I would have no payments during the Loan Modification process. Likewise, I would not be in default, with all payments, taxes and insurance would be put ""on the back end"". There would be no fees, fines or penalties because I was doing a Loan Modification.Now it was Wells Fargo holding all the cards, but again, shouldn't I trust them? After all, if all they want is for me to be a current mortgage holder, then this process was the way to go, wasn't it?My accountant assured me, ""They have enough houses in foreclosure, Pat. They don't want your home.""With his help, I once again threw myself into the process of the Loan Modification machine.Around this time, my friend the attorney, who specializes in family law, said, ""Have Wells Fargo fax me a letter stating the terms they've told you. You should have all that in writing.""So I called the guy I'd spoken to, who said that he ""couldn't fax anything out of the office"".I said, ""What are you talking about, you can't fax? Then e-mail him a letter.""The guy replied, ""Oh no, we can't e-mail out of these offices either.""I told the attorney what the Wells Fargo rep said, and he replied, ""Call him back and have him contact the mortgage department and make SURE they don't put you in foreclosure!""""But,"" I said, ""I'm not even in default!"" The attorney was adamant, so I did as instructed.The Wells Fargo rep replied, ""Oh no, we can't contact that department, we don't have the ability to contact any department outside our own!""""What are you talking about, aren't you ALL Wells Fargo?"" He said yes, but ""the system"" wasn't set up to allow them to speak to the other departments.Now, you're all saying what everyone else does at this point. Wasn't I suspicious? Didn't this send up red flags? Sure it did! But Wells Fargo was the new lender, and now it was they who held all the cards! What was I supposed to do, call them all liars?This process went on and on and on -- throughout the entire year of 2010, and through 2011 until September of that year. Throughout that entire time, we would be told that the paperwork had expired, ""grown stale"", and told to resubmit, resubmit, resubmit some more, which we did ad nauseum. We did everything we were told to do. What else were we SUPPOSED to do?From January 2010 until September 2011, I was traded off from one Home Preservation ""Specialist"" to another, each one coming across like nothing more than a glorified telemarketer. In September 2011, the third of these ""specialists"" sent me a letter, denying my Loan Modification -- after over TWO years of being jerked around, claiming that my Profit and Loss statement (for my comic store) was insufficient.By the 28th of September, Wells Fargo had filed a foreclosure against me, and mailed me the paperwork so that it arrived ON my birthday, October 1st, 2011. I spent the day crying.With the help of my attorney friend, I filed a counter against their foreclosure, but was forced to hire an attorney in the beginning of 2012 -- Stamatakis + Thalji + Bonanno -- in Tampa, recommended to my accountant, who passed that information along to me. I gave them a retainer, and they began the process of filing motions to dismiss, among other motions. This point-counterpoint went back and forth without anyone gaining ground for two years. Every so often, we'd hear from them that motions were being filed, but that everything was the same. No change.Here's where things take a BAD TURN, and it all started with -- a wedding!By this point in my life, 2011-2014, I had a girlfriend -- Ashley -- whom I met in the latter days near the end of my first marriage when she began helping out at the comic shop, taking over for the fellow who was moving away, while I was busy taking care of Mom before she died.  After my first wife and I separated again in 2007, Ashley and I became more and more involved, first as friends before becoming near inseparable companions. We have almost everything in common, and our differences in interests are negligible and endearing. My divorce of my first marriage was final December 1st, 2011. Ashley and I became engaged on Christmas Day 2012, almost 13 months later.We envisioned growing older in that house -- she's younger than I am, and would like children of her own -- and spoke of having a family of our own there in my childhood home. I thought of how happy that would have made Mom and Grandma, to bring the joy of a full-on family back to the house. My children are all grown, and I really like the idea of having a second chance to be a dad again. When my first wife and I were married -- very young -- I admit with deep  regret that I was far more self-centered and self-absorbed than I am now. I was a good dad, mind you -- never went out with the boys, or played golf or sports, nor was I abusive in any way -- but I was *a real couch potato*, coming in after work to watch my TV shows, eat dinner, and do my own thing. I regret not spending more time with my kids, other than to help them with homework and read to them sometimes before bedtime. I would love to have a second chance to be a better dad. I can't make up the lost time to my adult children -- I wish I could, because I love them with all my heart -- but I know I'm a better man today than I was when I was younger.Ashley has gone back to college to become an RN, and is currently taking courses. As of December 2014, she has about 18 months remaining before she will have her Associates in Science degree and her RN license.Of course, as couples do, Ashley and I began tossing wedding dates back and forth when we might like to get married. The one date which came up was February 22nd, because that was my Grandma's birthday. It wasn't until I learned that my Dad's parents were also married on February 22nd that I really got that date stuck in my head. It seemed so perfect, to honor my parents and grandparents. I left it up to Ashley, however, because I'd already been married before, and had my big day. She had ideas how we'd proceed with a big ceremony, but felt that we could renew our vows in a big ceremony someday later, when so many things had been sorted out -- not the least of which was the house -- but that we could have a civil ceremony on February 22nd of 2014 because the day fell on a Saturday. It won't fall on a Saturday for six more years, and we didn't want to wait six years for that date to be our wedding anniversary.The entire thing came together in three days, from the day we just spontaneously decided to have our wedding to the date of the wedding. BUT before we did anything, we called the attorneys for the foreclosure defense, because we didn't want ANYTHING to upset the process. The attorney replied, ""All this will mean is, when we get into the Loan Modification phase, Ashley will need to provide some proof of income! Otherwise, your getting married won't change a thing!""WRONG.We married as we'd hurriedly planned on February 22nd, filing our license with the Clerk of the Court for Pinellas County, Florida a couple of days later. We were so happy and excited!A couple of months went by. Suddenly, around the end of April, a persistent person kept coming to the house in the mornings, knocking loudly, then leaving and driving away. Well, we're at the comic book store often working late doing paperwork, because that's when it's quiet and Ashley has college classes, as I mentioned earlier. So we're not dressed early in the morning. This went on until the beginning of May, when the person hid his car down the road, and then hid in the neighbor's bushes. Ashley was walking to the car around noon, so we could head to the store. I was just inside the door. The man jumped out, ran across the yard, and served Ashley a set of the foreclosure papers. He began interrogating her, asking her who she was, what business she had at the house and so forth. She had no idea at that moment who he was or what the papers were, so she refused to answer. He ran away as I came out, jumping into his car to speed off.We were then notified in June 2014 that a hearing had been scheduled for August to set a sale date for the house, to force the foreclosure process through to the ultimate conclusion.The attorney told us that we could do one of two things: file for a new Loan Modification, which he could do for $500.00, or file for Bankruptcy Chapter 13 for $1,500.00. He said these would stop the foreclosure process and cancel the hearing. We opted for the Loan Modification process. He then said we'd have to do the Bankruptcy instead, but it was a 1 to 5 year process. I *believed* I understood the idea was to discharge debt while improving my debt-to-income ratio, because I knew that term from having done a refinance with my first wife on our old house back in 2004. So I *thought* I understood what was going on now, and hey -- 1 to 5 years? Ashley would be an RN in less than 2 years, so I thought everything would be fine.WRONG.I was scouring a lot of avenues trying to come up with the $1,500.00 when I wrote a very good friend of mine for advice. In turn, he said, ""I'm going to loan you the money to save your house"", and God bless him, I still owe him that money (I haven't forgotten), because he DID come through for me!!We contacted the attorney to get him the fifteen hundred, who said, ""Well, we'll need another $310.00 for filing fees."" We had an additional $200.00, so they agreed to take that. All in all, we gave them $1,700.00 for the Bankruptcy which I *thought* I understood, and clearly did NOT. After they were paid, the attorney was able to stop the foreclosure -- don't cheer yet! It was only temporary -- and call off the hearing with days to spare. THEN he dropped the bombshell, we'd meet with a Bankruptcy trustee within a week, and 30 days later -- by the first of October -- we'd have to start paying TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH to stay in the house. If we couldn't agree to that, we wouldn't be able to stay in the house!Why was the monthly amount so high when the Loan Modification -- if it had just gone through originally as planned -- should have reduced the monthly payment from the $983.00 down to around $550.00? Because Wells Fargo has added FEES, PENALTIES, LEGAL FEES, COURT COSTS and MORE to the tune of $50,000.00 on top of the original $82,000.00 mortgage, PLUS tacked on an extra $5,000.00 onto the original mortgage!!Therefore, to get out from under, if I have to pay the entire sum, I'd have to give them $137,000.00!!Obviously, we couldn't agree to do $2,000.00 a month, no matter how much I want to stay in my house. I knew I couldn't come up with that kind of money. The trustee then released the bankruptcy, the foreclosure process began again, and a NEW HEARING is set for December 16, 2014.  Yes, NEXT WEEK!!!!Merry Christmas.We spoke to HUD and looked into the HAMP and HARP programs. After getting a good deal of run around, which left me reduced to tears -- yes, I'm a man, standing in my comic book store, weeping over my boyhood home -- we were told to ""approach the lender and start a new Loan Modification"".Again, we approached the attorney: ""What about the Loan Modification you mentioned?""They replied: ""We can do that for $500.00, but the hearing will still go through, and a sale date will be set for your house. Or you can do the Loan Modification yourself.""We asked: ""Can you take $500.00 from the $1,700.00 we already gave you?""The answer: ""No, that money is already spent.""So we called Wells Fargo ourselves. The woman we spoke to was nice enough. She said to go to a particular page and download the Loan Modification package. She also mailed us one. She said that the hearing against the house could be canceled and the foreclosure stopped before Thanksgiving. Get the paperwork filled out, send it in, and they would call to do a financial interview. I was excited beyond words. Finally, a chance to breathe!We got the forms, sent them to the accountant, met with him, and he got the forms back to us. This took two weeks of going back and forth -- he also has other clients, I understand that -- and then we called HUD to go over the numbers with THEM before sending the package to Wells Fargo. HUD said it all met the criteria for a successful Loan Modification!Okay, we called Wells Fargo. They said, ""Don't e-mail them, FAX them"" and then directed us to go to the branch near us and fax the papers from there. We did this on November 21st, 2014. We then expected the call from Wells Fargo.WRONG.There was no call. So WE called. They didn't know who Ashley had spoken to. We said we needed to do the interview. They said someone would call us back. Thanksgiving came and went with no call. Then the first week of December came and went. We called again.The clock is ticking!We also called the attorney. ""File a motion to stop the hearing, we've started a Loan Modification! They said the hearing would be canceled if we did that ... we're just waiting for the interview call!"" So they filed a motion.But the hearing *wasn't* canceled. So yesterday, we called Wells Fargo AGAIN. Wells Fargo said, ""Have your attorney call OUR attorney.""There was still no word by this afternoon.Today, December 10th, with six days til doomsday, I had the bright idea to speak with the attorney, Chris Young, with whom I've filed for disability due to health issues largely stemming from an automobile accident in 2010, plus serious  eyesight issues. To digress a moment: I went blind in my right eye in the summer of 2001, and suffered a retinal detachment in my sighted left eye in the summer of 2011, and almost went blind then.So today, I thought -- incorrectly -- that the disability attorney might ALSO be able to file a motion to cancel the hearing against my house, as I am diligently working toward that goal while also seeking a new Loan Modification. Perhaps if both attorneys file? He replied no. Apparently, HE was told by the foreclosure attorney that the hearing will not be canceled. Wells Fargo would rather just foreclose on the house.So much for the statement, ""They don't want your house, Pat"".They must think there is buried treasure there.We called Wells Fargo again, this afternoon, to demand we get this interview process done. They said we have to FAX THE PAPERWORK AGAIN tomorrow. Can you believe it?? The guy said he can't read the typed and printed responses to their own forms!!SO TOMORROW, with all the paperwork filed -- allegedly -- the Loan Modification process will start again!! BUT the hearing will NOT be canceled. We should go to the Judge next Tuesday, we were told, and tell the Court that we have started a Loan Modification with Wells Fargo!!!IS THIS A JOKE?Am I supposed to believe ANYTHING I am told now?❖ ❖ ❖WHAT ABOUT THAT FUNDRAISER I STARTED TALKING ABOUT?So what is this fundraiser about?Saving the house.What are the perks?Well, I own a comic book store.

I intend to publish the book through Amazon's CreateSpace and Kindle Direct Publishing features. Those who donate $100.00 will get a free print copy.The more you contribute, the more you'll get. As I indicated, there will be sketches and cartoons.  Four illustrations -- two sketches, two satirical cartoons -- will be printed on card stock and also made available.  Donate $250.00 for all four pieces of art and a copy of the book.Finally, I intend to do three paintings, the designs of which have long been decided on. Each painting is part of a larger theme. The paintings, when done, will be auctioned off on eBay as a set. The theme is PLIGHT OF THE COMMON MAN, who will be represented in the paintings as a regular person losing his home and family, only to end up homeless. The paintings speak to what is happening, like a plague, in America today.For those who donate $500.00, you'll get a DVD video of me painting the three paintings, PLUS a free copy of the book, PLUS all four sketches.–  OR – (This part WASN'T mentioned anywhere else)If you don't have a lot of money, would you like to DONATE to preserve the good and decent home built by my mother, Rita Potter? Mom worked as a Pediatric Psych Nurse (an RN and CN 4) at Morton Plant Hospital in Clearwater, Florida for over two decades, helping THOUSANDS of young people overcome addictions to drugs as well as deal with psychological disorders, abusive environments, and many distressing issues.I'm just a comic book store owner.

Again.Yes, tomorrow, we WILL call Wells Fargo YET AGAIN to try to see if the foreclosure process can be stopped.Yes, tomorrow, we WILL once more attempt to have the hearing against our home stopped.I DO intend to file a DIRECT request with the Judge. I will go to the Courthouse in Clearwater and file it before I ever set foot in the door of the store. AND I will make sure I have a stamped confirmation that they received it.Yes, I will go through the motions.But in the end, I BELIEVE IT'S PEOPLE LIKE YOU who will make the difference!!WE all represent THE  COMMON MAN, and by that I mean ""Mankind"", meaning ALL GENDERS, as well as sexual orientations, cultures, ethnicity, and religions.The government consisting of agencies such as HUD and the like, the banks like Wells Fargo and Bank of America, and institutions who say that they will help people like me and you are not in it to help people like you and me, they're in it to help THEMSELVES.But we can pull together as a people, and not just a nation here in the United States, but as a world of people everywhere. We have to help one another when we can, while we can.Today, Ashley and I need your help.Please donate to THE PLIGHT OF THE COMMON MAN fundraiser today.Time is of the essence.Thank you.Patrick PotterLargo, Florida❖ ❖ ❖Risks and ChallengesI've been asked what risks and challenges I face. In fact, the only challenge is time. There is no risk, unless I don't meet the goal and / or the courts decide NOT to stave off the execution by allowing a sale date to be set for my home.BUT, if we meet the goal, I believe we can seriously pay off the home! In that case, I have nothing negatively impacting me to prevent me from completing the project, because what banks like Wells Fargo has done is despicable, and I am passionate to want to speak out against the kind of dirty tricks they have used to, for all intents and purposes ""steal"" people's homes from under them!I am an extremely multi-talented individual. I am an outstanding writer, an excellent cartoonist and artist, and I am sarcastic and angry enough to follow through and pull off EXACTLY what I am promising you here!My wife is a wonderful person who can keep the store going if I need to take time away from the shop to stay home and focus on the task, so I know I can meet the deadline I have set for myself.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Traditionally, families gathered many types of foods throughout the year and preserved the food in many different ways.  Today, some of those techiniques still exist and with today's technology, it has become easier.  This idea that we have, of creating a cookbook, will benefit our communities in many ways.  Sharing good food with another person does not only satisfy ones hunger, but it also heals what is with in, by providing a warmth to ones spirit.  When food is prepared with love and labor, it brings to the dish another ingredient that you cannot purchase in a grocery store.  We want to encompass this and bring it to many others. We love cooking and gathering foods.</p>
<p>With this funding, Warren King George and I will be able to continue to create and document the different ingrediants that we find and gather around the Salish Sea areas.  How it was prepared traditionally and how it can be done in today's world.  We have many documented now and it is posted on our facebook page, Salish Sea Traditional foods.  Now we just intend to pull it all together and makea and have the book published.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I have been teaching formally for 8 years, and am currently teaching 4th grade. I have been writing poetry for a lot longer than that, having hosted open mics, slams, and performed and led workshops in schools and theaters across the country. </p>
<p>I am honored to do what I do. I believe that teaching is one of the most noble and important professions that exists. This book is inspired by the experiences I've had in the realm of education, the people I've encountered, heard or learned about, and the challenges (new and familiar) that we struggle through, in order to change lives.</p>
<p>'Who Wants To Be a Teacher?' is a collection of poems (and a few anecdotes) that will hopefully open some minds to the true struggles and value of the future shapers who's work can not be measured in the hours spent inside of a school building. </p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to publish this collection of poems, in both print, and digital audio. The $2,500 will cover the printing of the first batch of books, the ISBN and copyright registration fees, the recording/distribution costs for the audio tracks, and promotional materials for the project. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Last year, I had a successfully funded campaign to publish two children's books. Since then, I have been bringing my books to festivals, conventions, establishing an online presence, and have been using them in school with my students. I have also sold books to school districts, and have developed educational guides for each of the books, for teachers.  </p>
<p>I hope that this book will help to open some eyes as to what it's really like for teachers inside and out of the classroom, and inspire some to either press on, or throw support behind those of us who do so everyday. I hope that this book finds its way into the hands of teachers, parents, administrators, lawmakers, and anyone else who has ever had a teacher. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please help by getting the word out! We teachers usually run in packs, so I hope that if you aren't able to buy a book, you can help by spreading the word to someone that you believe may appreciate this effort/cause. </p>

</div><p>You know you’re an awesome guy: you have great taste in
music, epic books,
you can write code, draw, write stories, engineer amazing things, damn it, you
even hit “Diamond” tier in League of Legends!</p>
<p>Yet every so often you feel like a classic indie game with
terrible graphics – only other nerds are eager to play with you. </p><p>And even
though it’s kind of cool – your friends, nerdy or not, are freaking awesome –
there’s something missing in your life and every time you pass that cute
colleague at work (or classmate in University’s halls) your heart sinks as she
just passes you without giving a second glance.</p>
<p>Then there’s night outs – a bunch of shy and overly analytical guys
sitting, drinking beer, talking about the latest video game release, secretly
hoping that maybe this night something, somehow will happen and you won’t be
going home alone (or at least a kiss… Please?!)</p>
<p>And what about those situations when you gather all the
courage (with a help of few too many drinks) and go introduce yourself to the
pretty ladies only to see them shifting uncomfortably in their seats,
pretending to carry on their conversation.</p>
<p>Remember that time you got tipsy and told your crush you
have feelings for her? The awkward expression on her face and the ever-popular
speech about how she values you so much as a friend and doesn’t really see you
as a romantic prospect.</p>
<p>Don’t get me even started on online dating – those sites are
surely populated by a bunch of bots, who never reply to your messages!</p>
<p>And when you’re home alone, reading your favorite book to
raise your spirits, you wonder why it’s so much easier in books – all you’d need
to do to get the girl is re-forge that ancient all powerful blade and slay the
cyber-wizard-dragon, while killing a bunch of mutant zombie ninjas in the process. That’s
nothing compared to the crap you have to deal with now!</p>
<h1><b>So what’s the problem?!</b></h1>
<p>Why a great guy like you keeps getting rejected by women in
your life? Why are YOU the one going home alone?</p><p></p><p>Chances are, there's more than one reason for this. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p>But what I do know is that there is one variable that has
the potential transform your life!</p><p></p>
<p>Can you imagine a world where that cute colleague or classmate
is the one looking at YOU with a shy yet eager look hoping you’ll
strike a conversation with her? Or even be the one who starts a conversation
with you “doing anything fun this weekend?” (Yes, that happens too, guys and
that’s when you invite her to watch that really awesome movie at your place.)</p>
<p>And the moment you enter the bar you realize that women are
actually checking you out. When you introduce yourself, instead of turning their backs
on you, those pretty women at the next table are now eagerly listening to every
word that comes out of your mouth (nope, that’s not science fiction.)</p>
<p>But the difference is even bigger when it comes to online
dating – going from 0% responses over hundreds of messages to getting messaged
by women first can be done without changing a single line of text in your profile.</p>
<p>And the friend-zone thing? As long as you’re
comfortable being sexual, that stuff no longer happens.</p><h1>How You Can Make This Fantasy World Into A Reality?</h1><div>
<p>I’m sure you figured out by know which variable I am talking
about that has the potential to transform our world – our appearance.</p>
<p>Just because we’re awesome on the inside (a little shy,
insecure about some things, maybe introverted, but awesome nonetheless!),
doesn’t mean that we can’t also look attractive and desirable on the outside
too. <b>Packaging matters</b>.</p>
<p>And it’s not that our beloved women are shallow, it’s just
human nature to first judge people on appearances and we can either stay
stubborn and shout “love me for how I look on the inside!!!” or start being
smart about it and learn how to be awesome on the inside AND on the outside!</p>
<p>The best part about this – we don’t need to be perfect to
reap all the rewards, so we don’t need to spend hours in the gym (unless you
want to) or stop drinking beer with buddies after work. Nor will you need to
spend hours in front of the mirror getting ready before a night out – let’s
leave this “pleasure” to our dear ladies.</p>
<p>Then how do we actually get those results?</p>
<p>By making small strategic changes to the way we look and present ourselves to the world. You can make those changes in an afternoon
(most of them) or over the course of weeks and months, depending on how comfortable
you feel with those changes. And, very importantly, do this in a healthy way so
that we’re not obsessing about looks, but realistically taking a step forward and growing our self-esteem in the process.</p>
<p>This, in turn, will start the positive feedback loop as you'll be getting comments like ""I don't remember you being so cool, what happened?"" and this, in the long-term, leads to confidence and knowing, that you're an attractive man, no matter what!</p>
<h1>It's Personal</h1>
<p>Did you notice how painfully accurate those descriptions of
your current situation is? The point is, I was on both sides of the rainbow:</p>
<p>I was that guy that gets just looked past. Quite literally
actually, ever had your crush smile at you and when you smile back you realize
she’s smiling to some hot guy right behind you, followed by a not-so-subtle ""I'm not looking at you"" comment? That sunken, all devouring feeling haunted me for a long time.</p>
<p>I also am that guy that gets random phone numbers at the
bar, unsolicited messages on dating sites and occasional booty calls from women I barely know. And there are those amazing women (once ones I would've considered them way out of my league) that choose to share this journey with me for more than a night.</p>
<p>The really cool part about it - I still am my nerdy, introverted, overly-analytical self,
who first thing in the morning after a one night stand checks /r/leagueoflegends.</p>
<p>The only thing that I consciously changed over the years is the way I presented myself to
the world and the freedom of confidence that comes with that. </p>
<p>For the past year, I’ve been running <a href=""http://sexystyleforjoe.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sexy Style for Joe</a> and helping other
smart and passionate men get similar results and it’s absolutely amazing to see
what appearance transformation does to one’s confidence and results with the fairer
sex. </p>
<p>Some of those guys, like me, prefer a bachelor’s lifestyle, others are looking
for something more serious and the strategies do work wonderfully for both
approaches.</p>
<p>And that’s the reason why you see me waving hands and
shouting in the video – I know firsthand how impactful getting sexy is and really
want to help fellow nerdy guys get these results too!</p>
<h1>The Book</h1>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/937309/files/20141017004133-coverfiverr.jpg?1413531693"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div>So what exactly can you expect if you decide to help fund <i>Nerd's Guide To Looking Sexy</i>?<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<p>Before everything else, you'll learn what actually makes a man look physically attractive. We'll take a hard look at the actual data and evidence to get results unbiased by personal preferences and limiting beliefs. This way we will easily identify which areas are holding us back and focus on them to get results as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Then, we will cover the topic of body image. You'll learn how to improve your self-esteem by improving your body image. This is very important as we don't want to spend our lives obsessing about our looks and feeling like crap every time we have a ""bad hair day"". Furthermore, this way we will set healthy foundations so that we're not focusing on improving our looks because of insecurities or lack of confidence, but do it from a position of power.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we'll cover posture and body language - a way to look impressive regardless what our physique looks like or how tall we are. All those subtle signals that our bodies are sending to the world make up a big part of what makes us look attractive or unattractive. Because of this, we will learn how to influence these signals to make sure they are presenting us in the most flattering way.</p>
<p>Then it's grooming time - you will learn simple strategies how to improve your grooming routine without massively increasing time spent in the bathroom or filling it with a zillion weird looking tubes with even weirder liquids (at least they smell nice). Skin care, choosing a fitting hairstyle (and maintaining it), manscapping and more - all will be covered in this chapter.</p>
<p>But that's not the end, you will then learn about men's style. But not the ""how do I impress my boss?"" or ""how can I look cool on instagram?"" men's style. You will be learning how to dress sexy, based on your physique, skin tone and natural features. You'll learn how to determine if clothes fit you right, layering, color coordination, thinking in outfits and how to maintain your clothes to last.</p>
<p>Lastly, no good book on improving men's appearance would be complete without a section that helps you achieve an attractive physique. Whether your focus is losing weight or building musculature - you'll learn simple and practical strategies to get results.</p>
<p>In practice this looks something like this:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/944380/files/20141020041414-480962bookcover_copy.jpg?1413803654"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>But the part that makes this book so special is not just the information and strategies in it. The best part about Nerd's Guide to Looking Sexy is that we will show you on real, regular nerds how applying strategies in each of the 6 Chapters, changes the way they look, their confidence and personal satisfaction, and, very importantly, the results they have with beautiful women. Step - by - step.<br/></p>
<p>If we raise the funds, we will take 3 men with different
physiques and facial features. At the time of writing the plan is:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The regular Joe – average height, weight.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Short and skinny or short and bulky.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Tall and skinny or tall and bulky.</p>
<p>If we raise more than 7.5k we will add another model (and,
another one 10k mark), all with different characteristics. Check out the perks
to learn how you can help decide who our models for this book will be!</p>
<h1>Let's Do This!</h1>
<div>If you ever felt inferior because of your looks or thought that a woman is ""out of your league"" because of hers - please help fund this project and together we will show that nerds are sexy!<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>Enough is enough, it's time your appearance represents all the awesomeness that is happening inside your mind - no more excuses. <br/><br/>
</div>
<div>Still have a tingling feeling of doubt? Below you'll find in depth descriptions of the perks and a very honest F.A.Q. so that you have all the necessary information to make a smart decision.</div>

<h1>F.A.Q.</h1>
<div>
<p><b>Q: When The Book Will Be
Ready?</b></p>
<p>The book will be ready and released in Q2 of 2015 (setting a
more exact date would be dishonest, considering that there are many variables
at play). If we manage to raise more funds than set, this can likely make the process
faster as we could include more industry experts.</p>
<p>I will personally be working on this book full-time!</p>
<p><b>Q: What About The Risks?</b></p>
<p>There are few possible pitfalls when working on this project
and it wouldn’t be fair not to consider them:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Not raising enough funds – as you’ll see below,
we plan on spending around 750 – 1000 USD (the biggest part going to getting
new wardrobe for them) per model and the exact amount will depend if we can
manage to have brands to partly sponsor our models.<br/><br/>
In case we don’t raise enough funds the book will happen, but we might need to
decrease the amount of nerds we can work with directly and invest in them. In
that case I would be looking for ways to invest more of my own money into the
book (as you’ll see from the breakdown, I won’t be taking anything for myself
from the original funding threshold).<br/><br/>
So even if all hell breaks loose, you will get an amazing book that will have
the potential to change your life.</p>
<p>·<span>  Potential issue: </span>the before - after changes are not that impressive – first
off, to have tangible proof how impactful the transformations were, we will survey several hundred women to rate our models as they look right now (for
transparency, we will do one questionnaire online, available to the public and
one offline, interacting with women on the street). After the transformation we
will repeat this experiment. To make sure our models follow through and stick
to the plan, we will have them prepare weekly / bi-weekly video blogs with what
they did that week, mention if they skipped anything, how they feel about the changes.<br/><br/>
Those who’ll get the <b>INSIDER'S LOOK</b> perk will be able to watch those video
blogs, ask follow up questions to our models and even help keep their spirits
up if going gets tough – awesome, right?<br/><br/>
Those video blogs will also be made available to everyone who orders the book
during this fund-raising, but only after it’s published.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Meeting the timelines – the set date is on the
conservative side and based on previous experience writing ebooks, articles, consulting men and should be enough time to prepare a product we can all be proud
of. If something completely unexpected happens (<i>force majeure</i>) you will be kept updated on the progress and we will
find a way to compensate for any delays.</p>
<p>As you can see, even though there is some risk that we
should keep in mind, it’s calculated and you’ll be definitely getting your
money’s worth.</p>
<p>As many of you, fellow nerds, don’t actually know me from
sexystyleforjoe.com, let me just put this here – for my personal consultation I
give the following guarantee to my clients:</p>
<p><i>“ 100% Results – even
if you love the consultation, but after applying the things you learned for
some reason you don’t notice an improvement in how women react to you, just
send me an e-mail and you’ll get a full refund, no questions asked.” </i></p>
<p>As you see, I take my work very seriously and it's always about getting actual results.</p>
</div>
<div><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Q: How The Funds Will Be Used?</b></div>
<div>
<b></b><p>It's important for you to know how exactly
money that’s raised will be used.</p>
<p>So here it is, in order of priority:</p>
<p>1. 
<b>Indiegogo
fees</b> – 4% if we raise the amount needed and 9% if we fall short.</p>
<p>2. 
<b>Fellow
nerd makeovers</b> – 750 USD per person. The actual amount will depend on how
difficult the transformation will be. This is the average amount my clients
spend on their style makeovers. If we wall short in raising funds we will first
try to keep the number of models (three) and find a way to cut costs, but at
a certain point we will need to drop a fellow nerd to make sure the
transformations are as impactful as they can be.</p>
<p>3. 
<b>Photography
and video production </b>– 600 USD. First, the costs are related to
documenting the transformations of our nerd models, but also as you’ll see in
the perks section, we have some really awesome stuff ready and we’ll need
professional production quality to make sure you get more than your money’s
worth.</p>
<p>4. 
<b>Professional
editing</b> – 500 USD. Even though English has been my working language for
most of my adult life and I’ve written more content over the last few years
than most people do in their whole lives, there’s still no substitute for
professional editing to make sure the book is always comprehensible and
enjoyable to read.</p>
<p>5. 
<b>Professional
design </b>– 400 USD. It would be somewhat ironic if a book that emphasizes how
important first impressions and the right image is would look like it’s simply
a word document converted to pdf. Little things like design matters.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/934581/files/20141015234528-Where_the_funds_will_go.png?1413441928"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I have already discussed what would happen if we fall short on
reaching our goal, but what happens if with your help we can raise more?</p>
<p>Words cannot really describe the epicenes of what awaits
you, but I’ll try.</p>
<p><b>If We Reach 5000 USD:</b></p>
<p>We’ll expand the budget for the nerd transformations to 1000
USD per model.</p>
<p><b>If We Reach 7500 USD:</b></p>
<p>We’ll add another model and those with the right perk will
help choose him!</p>
<p><b>If We Reach 10000
USD:</b></p>
<p>We’ll add one more model and those with the right perk will
help choose him!</p>
<p>Also, all money over 7500 USD will be used to get the best
people in the business to provide their expertise too.</p>
<p><b>If We Reach 20,000
USD:</b></p>
<p>Well, I’m a dreamer, but I don’t have exact plans over this
stage. I guess I’ll have to tattoo “Nerds are Sexy!” or something like that to
commemorate how awesome you guys are! (No, I don’t have any tattoos yet and
knowing that this is how I might get my first one is scary and a bit exciting
too haha)</p>
<p>At this stage guys with the <b>INSIDER'S LOOK</b> perk and above will
be the ones who decide what more you want in the book! </p>
<p><b>Q: Why an e-book?</b></p>
<p>Even though I get nostalgia every time I pick up an
actual book, the
fact is that traditional publishing would greatly increase the costs and the
effort <span>needed to put into handling logistics of
publishing that could be put into making the content even more awesome</span>. And let’s
face it, with current tools e-books are just as accessible and comfortable to
read as traditional books.</p>
<p><b>Q: But I’m Short / Tall / Fat / Skinny, can I still look
hot?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely! Yes, having physique that would put Adonis to shame definitely helps make you look attractive but it's not a must. Furthermore, in this book you'll learn strategies how to stop obsessing about your imperfections and make the most out of what you got. </p>
<p><b>Q: I have this
physical condition that…?</b></p>
<p>I won’t BS you, if you have a physical condition that’s
constantly visible, it sucks but there's no good reason why you shouldn’t look your best. Even more so, as long as you have every other part covered, you can be considered sexy by women despite having particular physical conditions (naturally, there are exceptions)</p>
<p><b>Q: Have you ever
written anything before?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Even if we would ignore all the articles on
sexystyleforjoe.com, guest articles on other websites, and guides on men’s
forums, I have indeed written an e-book before.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.2have2be2do.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/The-Art-Of-Life-Design.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You can download it here for free</a>.</p>
<p><b>Q: Am I too old / too young for this book?</b></p>
<p>Even though I mostly work with men in their 20s and 30s,
the principles are timeless and as you saw, we’ll have a dedicated chapter to
discuss how the way you present yourself should adjust as you hit a certain age
group.</p>
<p><b>Q: In the video you
mention it can be done in an afternoon? I don’t think so!</b></p>
<p>Great question. The appearance transformation you see in
the video includes the following changes:</p>
<p></p>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span><p>·<span> 
</span>Hairstyle (~30 minutes.)</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Grooming (~40 minutes.)</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Posture and body language (instant.)</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Clothes (instant if you already own sexy
clothes, ~2 – 3 hours if you know exactly what you’re shopping for and have
access to stores that have those items.)</p>
<p>So technically yes, the changes can be done in an afternoon.
Interestingly, my body composition barely changed since taking the “Before”
photo and making the video – yes, that’s how impactful fitting clothes and
proper posture can be!</p>
<p>Naturally, internalizing all the information you’ll be
learning from the book will take more than an afternoon and that’s great as
you’ll have time to get comfortable with your new look.</p>
<p><b>Q: Who's on your team?</b></p>
<p>Even though I have quite a few advisers (experts in their fields) willing to help and share their expertise, officially I am taking all the heavy lifting on my shoulders.</p>
<p>I am, however, actively looking for a fitness expert, who specializes in helping men get fast results, to help co-write the fitness section of this book.</p>
<p>I also have a great guy (fellow nerd) helping with media production for perks.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is this a ""pick up"" book?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely not. Even though our goal is to be as attractive to our dear ladies as possible, we will be doing so by making sure our appearance represents the awesomeness that happens on the inside and building healthy self-esteem.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: What are your Nerd Credentials (favorite games, books, background, etc.)?</b></p>
<p>My favorite game by far is the “Civilization” series (started playing at Civ 2.), big fan of League of Legends (I play a mean Akali!)</p>
<p>Favorite fiction book, I must say ""The Witcher"" series by Andrzej Sapkowski.</p>
<p>Other random nerdy stuff:</p>
<p>-Got perfect score from math exam and near perfect from physics. Completely sucked at ""soft"" subjects.</p>
<p>-First girlfriend at a late age of 20 or 21 (it was ""official"" somewhere around my birthday.)</p>
<p>-In high school lead several successful clans in Lineage 2 (I think the popularity of L2 in our school is one of the main reasons I had friends back then haha) </p>
-Wrote fan fiction for another online game.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>-Love watching physics lectures and debates on youtube before going to sleep.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div><b>Q: Why ""Nerd's"" guide? Isn't the term a bit offensive?<br/><br/></b></div>
<div>I strongly believe that there's no good reason to take oneself too seriously and a bit of self-irony is healthy. I also strongly believe that in our modern culture being smart and passionate about something should be celebrated, not looked down upon, so I think being called a ""nerd"" is actually a cutesy complement.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>But also because I struggled with this identify for a while. I also had this belief that nerds are supposed to be wearing oversized stained t-shirts (with a hole preferably), have long unmanaged hair and overall look as sexually appealing as a rotten potato. So early in my university years I tried fight this identify, and pretended that I don't enjoy all the things that make me happy just to appear ""cool"" - yup, young and stupid. <br/><br/>
</div>
<div>Took me a few years and a lot of experience to realize that nerd's can be sexy and now I take pride in being one.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>

music, epic books,
you can write code, draw, write stories, engineer amazing things, damn it, you
even hit “Diamond” tier in League of Legends!
Yet every so often you feel like a classic indie game with
terrible graphics – only other nerds are eager to play with you. And even
though it’s kind of cool – your friends, nerdy or not, are freaking awesome –
there’s something missing in your life and every time you pass that cute
colleague at work (or classmate in University’s halls) your heart sinks as she
just passes you without giving a second glance.
Then there’s night outs – a bunch of shy and overly analytical guys
sitting, drinking beer, talking about the latest video game release, secretly
hoping that maybe this night something, somehow will happen and you won’t be
going home alone (or at least a kiss… Please?!)
And what about those situations when you gather all the
courage (with a help of few too many drinks) and go introduce yourself to the
pretty ladies only to see them shifting uncomfortably in their seats,
pretending to carry on their conversation.
Remember that time you got tipsy and told your crush you
have feelings for her? The awkward expression on her face and the ever-popular
speech about how she values you so much as a friend and doesn’t really see you
as a romantic prospect.
Don’t get me even started on online dating – those sites are
surely populated by a bunch of bots, who never reply to your messages!
And when you’re home alone, reading your favorite book to
raise your spirits, you wonder why it’s so much easier in books – all you’d need
to do to get the girl is re-forge that ancient all powerful blade and slay the
cyber-wizard-dragon, while killing a bunch of mutant zombie ninjas in the process. That’s
nothing compared to the crap you have to deal with now!
So what’s the problem?!
Why a great guy like you keeps getting rejected by women in
your life? Why are YOU the one going home alone?Chances are, there's more than one reason for this. But what I do know is that there is one variable that has
the potential transform your life!
Can you imagine a world where that cute colleague or classmate
is the one looking at YOU with a shy yet eager look hoping you’ll
strike a conversation with her? Or even be the one who starts a conversation
with you “doing anything fun this weekend?” (Yes, that happens too, guys and
that’s when you invite her to watch that really awesome movie at your place.)
And the moment you enter the bar you realize that women are
actually checking you out. When you introduce yourself, instead of turning their backs
on you, those pretty women at the next table are now eagerly listening to every
word that comes out of your mouth (nope, that’s not science fiction.)
But the difference is even bigger when it comes to online
dating – going from 0% responses over hundreds of messages to getting messaged
by women first can be done without changing a single line of text in your profile.
And the friend-zone thing? As long as you’re
comfortable being sexual, that stuff no longer happens.How You Can Make This Fantasy World Into A Reality?
I’m sure you figured out by know which variable I am talking
about that has the potential to transform our world – our appearance.
Just because we’re awesome on the inside (a little shy,
insecure about some things, maybe introverted, but awesome nonetheless!),
doesn’t mean that we can’t also look attractive and desirable on the outside
too. Packaging matters.
And it’s not that our beloved women are shallow, it’s just
human nature to first judge people on appearances and we can either stay
stubborn and shout “love me for how I look on the inside!!!” or start being
smart about it and learn how to be awesome on the inside AND on the outside!
The best part about this – we don’t need to be perfect to
reap all the rewards, so we don’t need to spend hours in the gym (unless you
want to) or stop drinking beer with buddies after work. Nor will you need to
spend hours in front of the mirror getting ready before a night out – let’s
leave this “pleasure” to our dear ladies.
Then how do we actually get those results?
By making small strategic changes to the way we look and present ourselves to the world. You can make those changes in an afternoon
(most of them) or over the course of weeks and months, depending on how comfortable
you feel with those changes. And, very importantly, do this in a healthy way so
that we’re not obsessing about looks, but realistically taking a step forward and growing our self-esteem in the process.
This, in turn, will start the positive feedback loop as you'll be getting comments like ""I don't remember you being so cool, what happened?"" and this, in the long-term, leads to confidence and knowing, that you're an attractive man, no matter what!
It's Personal
Did you notice how painfully accurate those descriptions of
your current situation is? The point is, I was on both sides of the rainbow:
I was that guy that gets just looked past. Quite literally
actually, ever had your crush smile at you and when you smile back you realize
she’s smiling to some hot guy right behind you, followed by a not-so-subtle ""I'm not looking at you"" comment? That sunken, all devouring feeling haunted me for a long time.
I also am that guy that gets random phone numbers at the
bar, unsolicited messages on dating sites and occasional booty calls from women I barely know. And there are those amazing women (once ones I would've considered them way out of my league) that choose to share this journey with me for more than a night.
The really cool part about it - I still am my nerdy, introverted, overly-analytical self,
who first thing in the morning after a one night stand checks /r/leagueoflegends.
The only thing that I consciously changed over the years is the way I presented myself to
the world and the freedom of confidence that comes with that. 
For the past year, I’ve been running Sexy Style for Joe and helping other
smart and passionate men get similar results and it’s absolutely amazing to see
what appearance transformation does to one’s confidence and results with the fairer
sex. 
Some of those guys, like me, prefer a bachelor’s lifestyle, others are looking
for something more serious and the strategies do work wonderfully for both
approaches.
And that’s the reason why you see me waving hands and
shouting in the video – I know firsthand how impactful getting sexy is and really
want to help fellow nerdy guys get these results too!
The Book

So what exactly can you expect if you decide to help fund Nerd's Guide To Looking Sexy?


Before everything else, you'll learn what actually makes a man look physically attractive. We'll take a hard look at the actual data and evidence to get results unbiased by personal preferences and limiting beliefs. This way we will easily identify which areas are holding us back and focus on them to get results as quickly as possible.
Then, we will cover the topic of body image. You'll learn how to improve your self-esteem by improving your body image. This is very important as we don't want to spend our lives obsessing about our looks and feeling like crap every time we have a ""bad hair day"". Furthermore, this way we will set healthy foundations so that we're not focusing on improving our looks because of insecurities or lack of confidence, but do it from a position of power.
Afterwards, we'll cover posture and body language - a way to look impressive regardless what our physique looks like or how tall we are. All those subtle signals that our bodies are sending to the world make up a big part of what makes us look attractive or unattractive. Because of this, we will learn how to influence these signals to make sure they are presenting us in the most flattering way.
Then it's grooming time - you will learn simple strategies how to improve your grooming routine without massively increasing time spent in the bathroom or filling it with a zillion weird looking tubes with even weirder liquids (at least they smell nice). Skin care, choosing a fitting hairstyle (and maintaining it), manscapping and more - all will be covered in this chapter.
But that's not the end, you will then learn about men's style. But not the ""how do I impress my boss?"" or ""how can I look cool on instagram?"" men's style. You will be learning how to dress sexy, based on your physique, skin tone and natural features. You'll learn how to determine if clothes fit you right, layering, color coordination, thinking in outfits and how to maintain your clothes to last.
Lastly, no good book on improving men's appearance would be complete without a section that helps you achieve an attractive physique. Whether your focus is losing weight or building musculature - you'll learn simple and practical strategies to get results.
In practice this looks something like this:



But the part that makes this book so special is not just the information and strategies in it. The best part about Nerd's Guide to Looking Sexy is that we will show you on real, regular nerds how applying strategies in each of the 6 Chapters, changes the way they look, their confidence and personal satisfaction, and, very importantly, the results they have with beautiful women. Step - by - step.
If we raise the funds, we will take 3 men with different
physiques and facial features. At the time of writing the plan is:
· 
The regular Joe – average height, weight.
· 
Short and skinny or short and bulky.
· 
Tall and skinny or tall and bulky.
If we raise more than 7.5k we will add another model (and,
another one 10k mark), all with different characteristics. Check out the perks
to learn how you can help decide who our models for this book will be!
Let's Do This!
If you ever felt inferior because of your looks or thought that a woman is ""out of your league"" because of hers - please help fund this project and together we will show that nerds are sexy!

Enough is enough, it's time your appearance represents all the awesomeness that is happening inside your mind - no more excuses. 

Still have a tingling feeling of doubt? Below you'll find in depth descriptions of the perks and a very honest F.A.Q. so that you have all the necessary information to make a smart decision.

F.A.Q.

Q: When The Book Will Be
Ready?
The book will be ready and released in Q2 of 2015 (setting a
more exact date would be dishonest, considering that there are many variables
at play). If we manage to raise more funds than set, this can likely make the process
faster as we could include more industry experts.
I will personally be working on this book full-time!
Q: What About The Risks?
There are few possible pitfalls when working on this project
and it wouldn’t be fair not to consider them:
· 
Not raising enough funds – as you’ll see below,
we plan on spending around 750 – 1000 USD (the biggest part going to getting
new wardrobe for them) per model and the exact amount will depend if we can
manage to have brands to partly sponsor our models.
In case we don’t raise enough funds the book will happen, but we might need to
decrease the amount of nerds we can work with directly and invest in them. In
that case I would be looking for ways to invest more of my own money into the
book (as you’ll see from the breakdown, I won’t be taking anything for myself
from the original funding threshold).
So even if all hell breaks loose, you will get an amazing book that will have
the potential to change your life.
·  Potential issue: the before - after changes are not that impressive – first
off, to have tangible proof how impactful the transformations were, we will survey several hundred women to rate our models as they look right now (for
transparency, we will do one questionnaire online, available to the public and
one offline, interacting with women on the street). After the transformation we
will repeat this experiment. To make sure our models follow through and stick
to the plan, we will have them prepare weekly / bi-weekly video blogs with what
they did that week, mention if they skipped anything, how they feel about the changes.
Those who’ll get the INSIDER'S LOOK perk will be able to watch those video
blogs, ask follow up questions to our models and even help keep their spirits
up if going gets tough – awesome, right?
Those video blogs will also be made available to everyone who orders the book
during this fund-raising, but only after it’s published.
· 
Meeting the timelines – the set date is on the
conservative side and based on previous experience writing ebooks, articles, consulting men and should be enough time to prepare a product we can all be proud
of. If something completely unexpected happens (force majeure) you will be kept updated on the progress and we will
find a way to compensate for any delays.
As you can see, even though there is some risk that we
should keep in mind, it’s calculated and you’ll be definitely getting your
money’s worth.
As many of you, fellow nerds, don’t actually know me from
sexystyleforjoe.com, let me just put this here – for my personal consultation I
give the following guarantee to my clients:
“ 100% Results – even
if you love the consultation, but after applying the things you learned for
some reason you don’t notice an improvement in how women react to you, just
send me an e-mail and you’ll get a full refund, no questions asked.” 
As you see, I take my work very seriously and it's always about getting actual results.

Q: How The Funds Will Be Used?

It's important for you to know how exactly
money that’s raised will be used.
So here it is, in order of priority:
1. 
Indiegogo
fees – 4% if we raise the amount needed and 9% if we fall short.
2. 
Fellow
nerd makeovers – 750 USD per person. The actual amount will depend on how
difficult the transformation will be. This is the average amount my clients
spend on their style makeovers. If we wall short in raising funds we will first
try to keep the number of models (three) and find a way to cut costs, but at
a certain point we will need to drop a fellow nerd to make sure the
transformations are as impactful as they can be.
3. 
Photography
and video production – 600 USD. First, the costs are related to
documenting the transformations of our nerd models, but also as you’ll see in
the perks section, we have some really awesome stuff ready and we’ll need
professional production quality to make sure you get more than your money’s
worth.
4. 
Professional
editing – 500 USD. Even though English has been my working language for
most of my adult life and I’ve written more content over the last few years
than most people do in their whole lives, there’s still no substitute for
professional editing to make sure the book is always comprehensible and
enjoyable to read.
5. 
Professional
design – 400 USD. It would be somewhat ironic if a book that emphasizes how
important first impressions and the right image is would look like it’s simply
a word document converted to pdf. Little things like design matters.


I have already discussed what would happen if we fall short on
reaching our goal, but what happens if with your help we can raise more?
Words cannot really describe the epicenes of what awaits
you, but I’ll try.
If We Reach 5000 USD:
We’ll expand the budget for the nerd transformations to 1000
USD per model.
If We Reach 7500 USD:
We’ll add another model and those with the right perk will
help choose him!
If We Reach 10000
USD:
We’ll add one more model and those with the right perk will
help choose him!
Also, all money over 7500 USD will be used to get the best
people in the business to provide their expertise too.
If We Reach 20,000
USD:
Well, I’m a dreamer, but I don’t have exact plans over this
stage. I guess I’ll have to tattoo “Nerds are Sexy!” or something like that to
commemorate how awesome you guys are! (No, I don’t have any tattoos yet and
knowing that this is how I might get my first one is scary and a bit exciting
too haha)
At this stage guys with the INSIDER'S LOOK perk and above will
be the ones who decide what more you want in the book! 
Q: Why an e-book?
Even though I get nostalgia every time I pick up an
actual book, the
fact is that traditional publishing would greatly increase the costs and the
effort needed to put into handling logistics of
publishing that could be put into making the content even more awesome. And let’s
face it, with current tools e-books are just as accessible and comfortable to
read as traditional books.
Q: But I’m Short / Tall / Fat / Skinny, can I still look
hot?
Absolutely! Yes, having physique that would put Adonis to shame definitely helps make you look attractive but it's not a must. Furthermore, in this book you'll learn strategies how to stop obsessing about your imperfections and make the most out of what you got. 
Q: I have this
physical condition that…?
I won’t BS you, if you have a physical condition that’s
constantly visible, it sucks but there's no good reason why you shouldn’t look your best. Even more so, as long as you have every other part covered, you can be considered sexy by women despite having particular physical conditions (naturally, there are exceptions)
Q: Have you ever
written anything before?
Yes. Even if we would ignore all the articles on
sexystyleforjoe.com, guest articles on other websites, and guides on men’s
forums, I have indeed written an e-book before.
You can download it here for free.
Q: Am I too old / too young for this book?
Even though I mostly work with men in their 20s and 30s,
the principles are timeless and as you saw, we’ll have a dedicated chapter to
discuss how the way you present yourself should adjust as you hit a certain age
group.
Q: In the video you
mention it can be done in an afternoon? I don’t think so!
Great question. The appearance transformation you see in
the video includes the following changes:

· 
Hairstyle (~30 minutes.)
· 
Grooming (~40 minutes.)
· 
Posture and body language (instant.)
· 
Clothes (instant if you already own sexy
clothes, ~2 – 3 hours if you know exactly what you’re shopping for and have
access to stores that have those items.)
So technically yes, the changes can be done in an afternoon.
Interestingly, my body composition barely changed since taking the “Before”
photo and making the video – yes, that’s how impactful fitting clothes and
proper posture can be!
Naturally, internalizing all the information you’ll be
learning from the book will take more than an afternoon and that’s great as
you’ll have time to get comfortable with your new look.
Q: Who's on your team?
Even though I have quite a few advisers (experts in their fields) willing to help and share their expertise, officially I am taking all the heavy lifting on my shoulders.
I am, however, actively looking for a fitness expert, who specializes in helping men get fast results, to help co-write the fitness section of this book.
I also have a great guy (fellow nerd) helping with media production for perks.
Q: Is this a ""pick up"" book?
Absolutely not. Even though our goal is to be as attractive to our dear ladies as possible, we will be doing so by making sure our appearance represents the awesomeness that happens on the inside and building healthy self-esteem.

Q: What are your Nerd Credentials (favorite games, books, background, etc.)?
My favorite game by far is the “Civilization” series (started playing at Civ 2.), big fan of League of Legends (I play a mean Akali!)
Favorite fiction book, I must say ""The Witcher"" series by Andrzej Sapkowski.
Other random nerdy stuff:
-Got perfect score from math exam and near perfect from physics. Completely sucked at ""soft"" subjects.
-First girlfriend at a late age of 20 or 21 (it was ""official"" somewhere around my birthday.)
-In high school lead several successful clans in Lineage 2 (I think the popularity of L2 in our school is one of the main reasons I had friends back then haha) 
-Wrote fan fiction for another online game.

-Love watching physics lectures and debates on youtube before going to sleep.

Q: Why ""Nerd's"" guide? Isn't the term a bit offensive?
I strongly believe that there's no good reason to take oneself too seriously and a bit of self-irony is healthy. I also strongly believe that in our modern culture being smart and passionate about something should be celebrated, not looked down upon, so I think being called a ""nerd"" is actually a cutesy complement.

But also because I struggled with this identify for a while. I also had this belief that nerds are supposed to be wearing oversized stained t-shirts (with a hole preferably), have long unmanaged hair and overall look as sexually appealing as a rotten potato. So early in my university years I tried fight this identify, and pretended that I don't enjoy all the things that make me happy just to appear ""cool"" - yup, young and stupid. 

Took me a few years and a lot of experience to realize that nerd's can be sexy and now I take pride in being one.


It's Time To Act
Made it this far? Look, it's obvious that this book is for you, you want to look attractive. 
The question now is whether you're willing to step up and go for it or you'll be making another excuse ""maybe next time""
Let's make this perfectly easy, if you help support this project this is happening:
1.  You will learn what makes a man physically attractive based on science and experience.
2. You will learn to love your body and grow your self-esteem in a healthy way.
3. You will learn how to groom yourself so that you no longer look like a Neanderthal.
4. You will learn how to pick clothes and build outfits that will make you look sexy.
5. You will learn how to improve your posture and body language to look impressive no matter what your physique is right now.
6. You will learn how to start shredding fat or building muscle so that in the long run you will have a physique that women will find sexy.
7. And when you will follow through with what you learn in this book you'll realize that no woman is ""out of your league"" anymore and you're a damn attractive man no matter what!
That's it.

Time to make it happen and I really hope you'll pick one of the perks that will add you to our community of smart and passionate men on the road to being sexy, so that you can meet others like yourself and maybe form friendships for life.

They love the emotional connection they have to the storyline as they recall their memories of attending their first race with a parent or the first time they took their kids to an event.  

And, they love the fact that Jaguar, Aston Martin, the ACO / 24 Hours of Le Mans and others are supporting this project giving it an unprecedented level of authenticity!

This is a story about a father and son bonding together around a shared

I am blessed to have received approval from Jaguar, Aston Martin, the 24
Hours of Le Mans race (ACO), the Ecurie Ecosse race team and Sir Stirling Moss
to use their names, illustrated images / likenesses and in some cases logo in
the book.  That really gives the book a

Status Update
Great progress has been made on book development - here are some key project updates:



The book text has been written and
edited; I have a focus group of readers helping me to refine the text to a final copy


Illustrating the book is well underway; there are samples in the Gallery on this page, in the video as well as the book website and Facebook
page


As mentioned above, I have cleared all
the major approval hurdles from an intellectual property standpoint


I am currently evaluating printing
partners and a final decision will be made depending on the funds generated.  However, my lead option is a highly reputable
domestic resource


The only real hurdle I face is financial resources and
driving awareness, which is where your partnership and participation is
greatly appreciated!


“This
is great!  What else can I do to help?”
Great question!  If
this book is appealing to you I am sure you can immediately think of at least
five people you know who either have kids, grandkids or nieces / nephews who
you tell about the book.  So, become a
brand advocate and help spread the word!

Type: An
Original Non-Fiction Book with Supernatural Themes.
                                          
Project
Name:
The
Yes After Yesterday™ – The Equation
 
The
Concept:
A Spiritual Odyssey – The 3D of The Third Eye.
The
Book, The Yes After Yesterday, tells a real life cross-cultural story
which takes place on three continents. This Book of Enlightenment, through the
dynamic of its iconic characters, illuminates the subtexts of the events, in order to pass on the torch of The Equation of Success and the unalienable rights to Life, Liberty, Equality and the Pursuit of Fulfillment.



 

 
The
Book’s Story:
The Story of a
young lad born to a wealthy family and shackled on a desolate island of divided
social classes.
 
The lonely youth dreams of
Freedom, yearns for the world
and contemplates the world
Beyond.
 
The silent Tears from his third
eye decode History’s biggest treasure, Time’s Silent Secret: The Equation.
 
Then, the young man leaves his
beloved family and abandons his wealthy inheritance to travel all over the
world, with the aspirations of discovering his higher self, his future and the
Divine Purpose of Life.
 
A wandering philosopher…he
experiences great adventures and even greater mental challenges.
 
Failures, tragedies, struggles
and surrenders lead him to seize the wrong decision and turn to the dark
dimension of the spiritual world.
 
Fast forward: thrills and
dangers carry the boy to the brink of death…until the very last moment reveals
a miraculous revelation.
 
The youth touches the
transcendence of the Light and achieves transformative enlightenment.
 

 
What
is our Global Goal?!
 
The Victory
is here! WE just need to MARCH!
 
We are
on the mission to raise the rays of success by raising $50,000 on
IndieGoGo.com for the cause of self-publishing The Yes After Yesterday worldwide.
 
We
really believe in this Innovation and we are convinced that every Human Being
from every corner of the globe will find this book as a source of light
when the night is dark. Therefore, we want to manage the pledge we all owe to
one another by taking responsibility not just for our dreams, but also the

<h3>Pluma - An Anthology of Spain</h3>
<p>We believe that travel transports us not only into another culture, but into a world of new and fascinating stories. We believe the power of stories can transform and change the world. We want to share them with you through an anthology of Spain.</p>
<p>We are eight women writers with diverse backgrounds, traveling to Spain for a travel writing course. Some of us have little room left in our passports for stamps, while some of us will be flying out of country for the first time. None of us, however, have been to Spain.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need help offsetting our travel expenses and a few bucks to get our anthology out into the world where more people can experience Spain and its stories.</p>
<p>Our fundraising goal is $5,000.00. We will use $200 for desktop publishing software for the anthology and promotional costs in Spain, such as our postcard perk. We will divide the remaining funds among the eight of us to help offset our airline fees, our class and program fees, and for a churro here and there while on the ground in Spain.</p>
<p>Donating to Pluma gets you in on the action! From an old-school snail-mailed postcard, to Skype dates in Spanish locales, to an autographed copy of our anthology, you can experience Spain right along with us! We'd love for you to join us on our adventure!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Your donations make a big difference. Travelling to new cultures gives us insight into the greater world and develops within us a new way of thinking, and deepens our compassion for our fellow human beings. Travel, on a global scale, is a win/win for everyone. By sharing the stories of the new people we will meet and describing the new and exciting landscapes, we can open the world up to travel and its benefits to readers without them ever leaving the livingroom.</div>

<h3>
<strong>WHY KIDS + CLIMATE CHANGE?</strong> </h3>
<p><span>Climate change will shape our children's future - so <em>why is it </em>that there aren't any books on the subject that kids would actually want to read?</span></p>
<p><span>Children can make a powerful difference in the world! In the 1980s, the new blue bin recycling programs were failing all across the continent - until they introduced recycling education in elementary schools. </span></p>
<p>We're trying to raise $5000 in funds to finance the illustration of the first book and launch <strong>the most important children's book since Dr. Seuss wrote the Lorax!</strong> Please help!</p>
<h3>Book1: The Big Chase </h3>
<p><em>A rhyming children's story in which hungry monsters abduct two children, who outwit their captors in a series of harrowing escapes.</em></p>
<p>Equal parts Pippi Longstocking and Dr. Seuss, the Big Chase is a children’s story that <strong>re-invents folklore for the 21<sup>st</sup> century </strong>to make climate change CRAZY INTERESTING for kids, and for the parents who read to them.</p>
<p>Featuring mesmerizing, hip illustrations and the page-turning pace of a Hollywood car chase. See for yourself! <strong><a href=""https://www.yousendit.com/download/UW13blFIQzN5UkcwYjhUQw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Sneak Peak"">Download our EXCLUSIVE SNEAK PEAK</a></strong> of the first half of Book 1 here. Just keep in mind that only a few pages have been professionally illustrated (that's what we need the funding for).</p>
<p class=""p2"">The first book is a joy to read aloud,like Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, and it's set in a near-future where a changing climate seems to be making life hard for people (AND monsters). </p>
<h3>Book2: Tales from the World of Tomorrow</h3>
<p> <span class=""s1"">Once the first book gains a mainstream audience, the second book in the series reveals that climate change is the real villain. The young protaganists learn where it comes from, and how to fight it at home. In the second book, the characters find to their surprise that they have the courage and power to change the world. </span>Children can make a powerful difference in the world!</p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Lovingly inked by acclaimed illustrator, Heiko Windisch</strong></p>
<p>The Big Chase features gorgeous black and white illustrations from the strange and wondrous imagination of Heiko Windisch, lovingly crammed with one-eyed oddities and wry details. See <a href=""http://heikowindisch.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">heikowindisch.com</a> and <a href=""http://hypnowlempire.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hypnowlempire.com</a> for more of Heiko's brilliant work.</p>

<p><em>The illustration process is labor-intensive.</em></p>
<h3>Why should I pre-order the book and/or original art?</h3>
<p>We are a couple starving artists, brimming with talent but lacking in conventional funding and spread a wee bit too thin.</p>
<p><span>The $5,000 we seek to raise will go straight to paying Heiko, our artist, so he can work full-time and finish up the book's awesome illustrations. The book is around 64 pages and contains significantly more content than what we show here, so there's a LOT of illustrating yet to be done. </span></p>
<p><span>We have some really cool rewards for our backers. Of course everyone gets a copy of the book when it's done, but we're also offering limited edition prints and original art that might eventually be collector's items!</span></p>
<p>We've gotten a long way already. We have a cleverly written, market-tested script, top-notch quirky character designs, a wild fantasy setting, and a kick-ass marketing plan that will bring the book in digital format to millions of young users of digital devices.</p>
<h3>Share The Big Chase!</h3>
<p>Please cajole your friends and co-workers into procuring a book or three, too! We need at least 200 people to buy the book to make our goal. You can do this by sharing our campaign on Facebook, Twitter, G+, etc.</p>
<p>Use the sharing functions at the top of this page to share our campaign with your friends. The top referrers for new visitors, new contributors and total funds will receive a mystery prize! </p>
<h2><strong>MORE ABOUT THE BIG CHASE</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Endorsed by kids</strong></h3>
<p>This is a hair-raising story of pursuit and near-misses that widens young eyes from the very first page, and holds their rapt attention to the satisfying conclusion. The proof is in the pudding: Whenever we read it aloud, children giggle and squeal all the way through, and then ask to be read it again. The monsters prove more bark than bite and fumble along as our young heroes outfox them in a mischevious climax.</p>

</h3>
<p>The Big Chase is partly inspired by spoken word and slam poetry - try reading aloud a few lines from the book to see why it works so well:</p>
<p class=""p1"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Then we heard the slap flap of dark wings in the night<br/></em><em>and the ziz, it came flying much faster than fright.</em></p>
<p class=""p1"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Next the crazy chonchon with bright feathers for hair <br/>and with fabulous ears flitting wild through the air</em></p>
<p class=""p1"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>And the Huwawa giant with huge hands in the sky <br/>came crashing and clutching, just missing us by... </em></p>
<p class=""p1"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>THIS MUCH.</em></p>
<p>The Big Chase is written in anaepestic tetrameter, the rhyming device used by poets from Byron to Seuss which, according to Wikipedia, ""produces a very rolling, galloping feeling verse"" that will mesmerize kids and parents alike. </p>
<h3><strong>Quirky characters rooted in folk tales from around the world</strong></h3>
<p>Powerful narratives draw their storytelling magic from ancient tales. So after painstaking research we’ve hand-picked the 10 quirkiest, most bizarre, most oddly-named monsters from real folk stories we could find: recruited across 6 continents and from unlikely oral traditions, medieval beastiaries, and a 10,000-year old epic. The result is a modern action thriller featuring an ancient cast of outrageous villains children won’t <em>ever</em> forget.</p>
<h3><strong>Meet the Monsters</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>That shack was the home of a very old witch and the beasts in that shack were a very strange mix.</em></p>
<p class=""p1"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>There was: A ziz, and a squonk and a three-legged toad, and a were-crocodile whose red eyes glared and glowed...</em></p>
<p class=""p1"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>A yowie, a chonchon, a big bonnacon, and poor Nellie long Arms whose arms were too long.</em></p>

MORE ABOUT THE BIG CHASE
Endorsed by kids
This is a hair-raising story of pursuit and near-misses that widens young eyes from the very first page, and holds their rapt attention to the satisfying conclusion. The proof is in the pudding: Whenever we read it aloud, children giggle and squeal all the way through, and then ask to be read it again. The monsters prove more bark than bite and fumble along as our young heroes outfox them in a mischevious climax.

Clever rhymes make it fun for parents, too

The Big Chase is partly inspired by spoken word and slam poetry - try reading aloud a few lines from the book to see why it works so well:
Then we heard the slap flap of dark wings in the nightand the ziz, it came flying much faster than fright.
Next the crazy chonchon with bright feathers for hair and with fabulous ears flitting wild through the air
And the Huwawa giant with huge hands in the sky came crashing and clutching, just missing us by... 
THIS MUCH.
The Big Chase is written in anaepestic tetrameter, the rhyming device used by poets from Byron to Seuss which, according to Wikipedia, ""produces a very rolling, galloping feeling verse"" that will mesmerize kids and parents alike. 
Quirky characters rooted in folk tales from around the world
Powerful narratives draw their storytelling magic from ancient tales. So after painstaking research we’ve hand-picked the 10 quirkiest, most bizarre, most oddly-named monsters from real folk stories we could find: recruited across 6 continents and from unlikely oral traditions, medieval beastiaries, and a 10,000-year old epic. The result is a modern action thriller featuring an ancient cast of outrageous villains children won’t ever forget.
Meet the Monsters
That shack was the home of a very old witch and the beasts in that shack were a very strange mix.
There was: A ziz, and a squonk and a three-legged toad, and a were-crocodile whose red eyes glared and glowed...
A yowie, a chonchon, a big bonnacon, and poor Nellie long Arms whose arms were too long.
But I think we were lucky: that shack was too small for the most monstrous giant, the worst of them all: Hu-WA-WA




Baba Yaga - A witch from Slavic tales, also known as Baba Jaga. Sometimes good, sometimes bad, she lives in a magic dancing hut that ends up pursuing the children through the woods. Heiko has illustrated Baba Yaga wearing authentic Świętokrzyskie folk dress from the mountains of Poland.




Ziz - A giant, ancient bird from the forest of Ela who is said to be large enough to block out the sun with its wingspan. A tale from ancient Hebrew tradition.




Squonk - The Squonk is a folk invention of 19th century American lumber-jacks, who told campfire stories about this unhappy, shy beast with misfitting warty skin - usually found whining in a puddle of its own tears. Heiko has illustrated our Squonk almost exactly as he is found in lumberjack folk drawings.




Three-legged toad - Jin Chan is a huge toad monster in an- cient Chinese folklore whose ceramic miniature is now a staple in gong Fu tea ceremonies.




Were-crocodile - In different parts of Africa, there are legends still told of men with the frightening power to turn themselves into crocodiles. 




Yowie - Oi, watch out for the YOWIE, mate.  An Australian version of a bigfoot, this huge ape-like creature was sighted by Aboriginal Australians and is still reported by visitors to the Outback. Heiko has illustrated our Yowie using an Aboriginal technique called ""X-ray art"" that shows internal anatomy.





Chonchon - The chonchon might be one of the smaller monsters in The Big Chase, but it's also one of the zaniest. The Mapuche of Chile say that some men can send their heads away from their bodies to fly hideously about on feathered ears. Heiko has illustrated our Chonchon with an explosion of Central American feathers.





Bonnacon - Ancient Romans and medieval Europeans believed this mythical Asian beast could throw burning dung great distances.





Nelly Long Arms - An english tale told to children about a long-armed swamp creature who inhabits the bog near the Cheshire village of Wybunbury. Heiko has illustrated Nelly wearing a somewhat tattered Victorian bathing costume.





Huwawa - A giant guardian of the ancient cedar forest in the Assyrian epic of Gilgamesh, the oldest story in history. Also known as Humbaba the Terrible. Heiko has illustrated the Huwawa's face based on ancient masks found at Sumerian and Assyrian sites, in which ""his face is scribed in a single coiling line like that of the coiled entrails of men and beasts, from which omens might be read.""

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Trapshot Archives, a small press located in Montreal, looks to promote emerging artists and writers as they put together their first cohesive bodies of work. Our aim is to call attention to Canadian creatives, help them put their best foot forward, and distribute their work into the hands of their supporters--people a lot like yourself.</p>
<p>As engaged members in the literary/arts community here in the city, we view this collaboration, promotion, publishing and distribution as a way of encouraging young creatives to succeed. Expressly, we offer an avenue to appreciate the celebrate the great work people are doing, and we'd love your support in continuing this effort.</p>
<p>Last year's books were sold locally, across cities, nationwide; shipped to Brooklyn, San Fransisco, London; found themselves on bookshelves as far as South Africa and South Korea. They were reviewed intimately by <a href=""http://art-sponge.com/2011/10/trapshot-archives/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Montreal art blogs</a>, and spotlit by renowned <a href=""http://www.thefoxisblack.com/2011/11/14/erika-alotsaars-lanonyme-a-collection-of-sensual-blind-drawings/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">design hubs</a>.</p>
<p>We hope to do the same with our two new gorgeous books, Gleb Wilson's ""The Plan"" and Frankie Barnet's ""Something Disgusting Happening""--with cover art work by Toronto artist <a href=""http://liamcrockard.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Liam Crockard</a>, of O'Born Contemporary Gallery. Each contains three original short stories that evoke, provoke and capture something subtle, something daring, and something a little too-true.</p>

<p>To do so, we're going to need a little help. JP King, mastermind behind Toronto's best indie print shop, <a href=""http://paperpusher.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paper Pusher Press</a>, is making us our books using risograph printing--a technique that can only be described as a mix between photocopying and screenprinting. The result is a unique, crisp and beautiful finish--and one that costs substantially less than how ""real"" books are made. It's about $600 to print up the books, $150 to pay Liam for his collaging, and $50 to shoot JP some extra love for the time he's put into this project.</p>
<p>The perks. Think of Indie Go Go as a way of pre-ordering your copies. Donate $10 and you're the first to have a copy of ""The Plan"" or ""Something Disgusting Happening.""

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Der Traum der beiden Architekturstudenten der Hochschule Darmstadt in Deutschland steht ohne finanzielle Unterstützung vor dem Aus. Der Plan war eine sechsmonatige Europareise. Die zeit zwischen dem 5. Semester und Bachelor-Abschlussarbeit bot sich dabei vortrefflich an. Geplant waren insgesamt 18000km über den Balkan nach Griechenland und Italien bis ins südliche Spanien und Portugal. Als Fahrzeug dient ein 21 Jahre alter VW T3 Syncro aus Beständen des österr. Bundesheers, den die beiden Reisenden Lucas Loritz (24) und Steffen Geppert (24) zu einem offroadfähigen Campermobil umgebaut haben.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Das Hobby Fotografie, Windsurfen, Architektur und Reiseabenteuer allgemein, präsentieren sie den zahlreichen Followern im Internet schon nach wenigen Kilometern Reisestart. Seit Mitte März sind sie auf Tour und haben bereits den Balkan, Griechenland und Italien bereist. Routentracking, Reiseberichte sowie Bilder ihrer kleinen pfiffigen Idee „Items“ finden sich auf der Reisehomepage sowie auf Facebook. Mit den „Items“ wollen sie Freunden und Sponsoren die Möglichkeit geben, Teil der Reise zu werden. Kleine Gegenstände werden von den Zweien mitgenommen und an passenden oder von Gegenstandbesitzer zugewiesenen Orten Europas abgelichtet. Mit Untertitel werden die Bilder anschließend ins Netz gestellt.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Um auch nach der Reise Menschen am Erlebten Teil haben zu lassen, planen die Jungs eine Fotoausstellung mit den besten Fotos zu organisieren.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Drei Monate vor Reisebeginn schafften es die beiden etliche Sponsoren für die Reise zu gewinnen.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Sie planten außerdem ein Buch zu verfassen, welches sich speziell an Leute ihres Alters richten sollte, die eine solche ähnliche Reise vorhaben. Inhalte wie Reisebilder, Sponsoringkonzepte, passendes Reisefahrzeug sowie andere hilfreiche Informationen sollten das Buch füllen.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Jedoch nach 11000 Reisekilometern kam es im südlichen Frankreich nahe Montpellier anders. Die Zwei werden ausgeraubt. Sie haben das Glück unbeschadet davon zu kommen, jedoch können die Diebe Wertgegenstände wie Laptops, I Phones, Bargeld etc. im Wert von 8000 Euro entwenden. Geschockt von der ganzen Situation, müssen die zwei mit dem restlichen Bargeld nach Deutschland zurückkehren. Drei Monate waren noch geplant. Viele Kilometer erlebnisreiche Tour durch Länder wie Spanien, Portugal und Frankreich waren noch vor ihnen. Das schon weit verfasste Reisebuch war unter dem Diebesgut. Ein großer Plan droht zu zerplatzen. Finanziell ist eine Reise ohne weitere Unterstützung nicht möglich.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Die Zwei wollen sich diesen Traum nicht entgehen lassen und haben nun vor in den Norden Europas zu reisen. Das Einsparen von Campingplätzen, die kürzere Anfahrt sowie das günstigere Reisen ohne Surfausrüstung sind der Grund für diese Entscheidung. Am 18. Juli soll es weitergehen, wenn das Spendenziel erreicht ist.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Da die beiden sich ausschließlich von Einkäufen in Supermärkten ernähren, stets versuchen frei zu nächtigen sowie Mautgebühren vermeiden, wird das Geld hauptsächlich für Diesel benötigt.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">---</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Videoedit by Achim Seeger.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">The dream of the two architecture students studying at the Hochschule Darmstadt in Germany is about to fold without financial help.<br/>Planned was a six-month trip across Europe. The time between the fifth semester and the Bachelor graduation seemed to be exactly the right time. Scheduled were 18000 km through the Balkans to Greece and Italy continuing to the south of Spain an Portugal. A 21 year old VW T3 Syncro from the Austrian Armed Forces served as a vehicle for Lucas Loritz (24) and Steffen Geppert (24) which they converted into a offroad camper. Their hobbies like photography, windsurfing, architecture and the travel adventures are presented to numerous followers on the internet just a few kilometres after the beginning of their tour. Since the mid of march they were on tour already having travelled the Balkans, Greece and Italy. Routetracking, travelreports and photographs of their smart idea ‚items’ are available on the homepage and on facebook. Through the ‚items’-idea they wanted to make both, their friends and sponsors, a part of the trip. The two take small objects on their trip and put them in suitable places or places the owners wished. With a subtitle the pictures are then put on the internet.<br/>The two also planned a photo exhibition showing the best shots after the trip to involve people in the journey.<br/>Three month prior to the beginning of the trip the two were able to acquire several sponsors. Also they planned to publish a book addressing young people like them, planning a similar trip. The book was supposed to be composed of pictures, the sponsoring concept, a fitting vehicle as well as other helpful information. <br/>However, after 11000 km in the south of France near Montpellier the trip took an unexpected turn. The two are robbed. Both ar lucky to be unscathed bot the thieves are able to steal valuables like laptops, iPhones, cash etc. worth over 8000 Euro. Shocked by the whole situation the two decide to return to Germany with the left cash money they have. They had three more month and several kilometres planned. An eventful tour through countries like Spain, Portugal and France ahead. The far advanced travel-book was among the stolen goods. A big dream is about to burst. Without any further financial support continuing the trip is impossible. The two don’t want to let their dream go and plan on travelling the north of Europe.

Der Traum der beiden Architekturstudenten der Hochschule Darmstadt in Deutschland steht ohne finanzielle Unterstützung vor dem Aus. Der Plan war eine sechsmonatige Europareise. Die zeit zwischen dem 5. Semester und Bachelor-Abschlussarbeit bot sich dabei vortrefflich an. Geplant waren insgesamt 18000km über den Balkan nach Griechenland und Italien bis ins südliche Spanien und Portugal. Als Fahrzeug dient ein 21 Jahre alter VW T3 Syncro aus Beständen des österr. Bundesheers, den die beiden Reisenden Lucas Loritz (24) und Steffen Geppert (24) zu einem offroadfähigen Campermobil umgebaut haben.
Das Hobby Fotografie, Windsurfen, Architektur und Reiseabenteuer allgemein, präsentieren sie den zahlreichen Followern im Internet schon nach wenigen Kilometern Reisestart. Seit Mitte März sind sie auf Tour und haben bereits den Balkan, Griechenland und Italien bereist. Routentracking, Reiseberichte sowie Bilder ihrer kleinen pfiffigen Idee „Items“ finden sich auf der Reisehomepage sowie auf Facebook. Mit den „Items“ wollen sie Freunden und Sponsoren die Möglichkeit geben, Teil der Reise zu werden. Kleine Gegenstände werden von den Zweien mitgenommen und an passenden oder von Gegenstandbesitzer zugewiesenen Orten Europas abgelichtet. Mit Untertitel werden die Bilder anschließend ins Netz gestellt.
Um auch nach der Reise Menschen am Erlebten Teil haben zu lassen, planen die Jungs eine Fotoausstellung mit den besten Fotos zu organisieren.
Drei Monate vor Reisebeginn schafften es die beiden etliche Sponsoren für die Reise zu gewinnen.
Sie planten außerdem ein Buch zu verfassen, welches sich speziell an Leute ihres Alters richten sollte, die eine solche ähnliche Reise vorhaben. Inhalte wie Reisebilder, Sponsoringkonzepte, passendes Reisefahrzeug sowie andere hilfreiche Informationen sollten das Buch füllen.
Jedoch nach 11000 Reisekilometern kam es im südlichen Frankreich nahe Montpellier anders. Die Zwei werden ausgeraubt. Sie haben das Glück unbeschadet davon zu kommen, jedoch können die Diebe Wertgegenstände wie Laptops, I Phones, Bargeld etc. im Wert von 8000 Euro entwenden. Geschockt von der ganzen Situation, müssen die zwei mit dem restlichen Bargeld nach Deutschland zurückkehren. Drei Monate waren noch geplant. Viele Kilometer erlebnisreiche Tour durch Länder wie Spanien, Portugal und Frankreich waren noch vor ihnen. Das schon weit verfasste Reisebuch war unter dem Diebesgut. Ein großer Plan droht zu zerplatzen. Finanziell ist eine Reise ohne weitere Unterstützung nicht möglich.
Die Zwei wollen sich diesen Traum nicht entgehen lassen und haben nun vor in den Norden Europas zu reisen. Das Einsparen von Campingplätzen, die kürzere Anfahrt sowie das günstigere Reisen ohne Surfausrüstung sind der Grund für diese Entscheidung. Am 18. Juli soll es weitergehen, wenn das Spendenziel erreicht ist.
Da die beiden sich ausschließlich von Einkäufen in Supermärkten ernähren, stets versuchen frei zu nächtigen sowie Mautgebühren vermeiden, wird das Geld hauptsächlich für Diesel benötigt.

The dream of the two architecture students studying at the Hochschule Darmstadt in Germany is about to fold without financial help.Planned was a six-month trip across Europe. The time between the fifth semester and the Bachelor graduation seemed to be exactly the right time. Scheduled were 18000 km through the Balkans to Greece and Italy continuing to the south of Spain an Portugal. A 21 year old VW T3 Syncro from the Austrian Armed Forces served as a vehicle for Lucas Loritz (24) and Steffen Geppert (24) which they converted into a offroad camper. Their hobbies like photography, windsurfing, architecture and the travel adventures are presented to numerous followers on the internet just a few kilometres after the beginning of their tour. Since the mid of march they were on tour already having travelled the Balkans, Greece and Italy. Routetracking, travelreports and photographs of their smart idea ‚items’ are available on the homepage and on facebook. Through the ‚items’-idea they wanted to make both, their friends and sponsors, a part of the trip. The two take small objects on their trip and put them in suitable places or places the owners wished. With a subtitle the pictures are then put on the internet.The two also planned a photo exhibition showing the best shots after the trip to involve people in the journey.Three month prior to the beginning of the trip the two were able to acquire several sponsors. Also they planned to publish a book addressing young people like them, planning a similar trip. The book was supposed to be composed of pictures, the sponsoring concept, a fitting vehicle as well as other helpful information. However, after 11000 km in the south of France near Montpellier the trip took an unexpected turn. The two are robbed. Both ar lucky to be unscathed bot the thieves are able to steal valuables like laptops, iPhones, cash etc. worth over 8000 Euro. Shocked by the whole situation the two decide to return to Germany with the left cash money they have. They had three more month and several kilometres planned. An eventful tour through countries like Spain, Portugal and France ahead. The far advanced travel-book was among the stolen goods. A big dream is about to burst. Without any further financial support continuing the trip is impossible. The two don’t want to let their dream go and plan on travelling the north of Europe. Saving on the costs for campingsites, the journey and the cheap trip without surfequipment are the reasons for this decision. July 15th they want to continue if they get all the donations together.

<p><b>What Do You Get For Your Donation?</b></p>
<p>Here’s what’s in it for you.  At
various donation levels you will receive:</p>
<p>•  <b>Copies of the book</b> for yourself,
friends, or family members.</p>
<p>•  <b>A Transgender History E-book</b> written by
our history chapter author, Genny Beemyn, Director of the Stonewall Center

<p><b>Where is the Money Going?</b></p>
<p>Glad you asked.</p>
<p>· 
<b>First</b>, to cover expenses incurred during the four-year
production leading up to publication including our web designer, two
illustrators, and a professional editor, all of whom offered their services at
reduced rates, and were necessary to logistically get the book done and in
print.</p>
<p>· 
<b>Second</b>, and more importantly, <b><i>to support a national
outreach project to improve the lives of trans and gender nonconforming people.
</i></b> This project will expand on the publication of the book by
enabling us to offer the book at reduced or no cost to individuals unable to
pay, to schools, libraries, community centers, and other support
services.  Also, the project will focus on the education of providers,
community and online forums for the exchange of information and for support, to
be a visible presence at national conferences, and to produce ongoing editions
of the book as issues evolve.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A breakdown of costs for this campaign </p>
<p>(if $50k goal is met with estimates of books purchased):</p>
<p><u>Approximate costs:</u></p>
<p>$14k – professional editor, web design, illustrators</p>
<p>$16k – purchasing (700) books to fulfill perks</p>
<p>$3.5k – shipping</p>
<p><u>$5k</u> – indiegogo fees</p>
<p>$38.5k TOTAL</p>
<p>…which would mean $11.5k would go toward donating books to community organizations (nearly 600 books – in the hands of trans people around the country). And even more if we make over our goal.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i><u>Trans Bodies, Trans Selves</u></i> has
involved four years of work from hundreds of authors, contributors, advisors, editors,
and volunteers who donated their time out of a desire to serve the trans and
gender nonconforming community.  Other than the four people listed above,
none of those involved are being compensated for their efforts. The 50+
authors, especially, deserve recognition for the significant energy and
expertise they have put into this project. We wish we could pay them all what
they deserve, but any amount would be minimal if shared among all. Any profits
from the book once it is released this spring will be funneled into the
non-profit and fulfilling its mission of education and sharing resources – most
immediately, getting this book into the hands of those who cannot afford it.</p>
<p>Additionally, Oxford does not make any money from
the fundraising and does not require that we raise money as a condition of
publishing the book.</p>

are able to purchase the book from Oxford at a significant discount, and in turn get it to those
in need at greatly reduced rates or even free. If we make our goal on indiegogo we will be able to donate hundreds of books. <span>We
negotiated with Oxford to get the lowest cover price possible so that the most
people could afford the book.  However, the book is large, with over 20
chapters, and could not be sold for lower than $39.95. We also plan to
offer reduced price copies at conferences. If you know of organizations that

<h3>The Basics</h3>
<p>How does the Crossroads Guide to the Writing Life help writers-in-need?</p>
<p>Simple... we're giving away copies of the Guide to the Writing Life for supporting our scholarship fund, which will help writers-in-need attend the 2012 Crossroads Writers Conference. </p>
<p>This is our fourth year with the conference and it's gotten better every time. The double-edged sword is that, as we've grown, more people have found out about what makes Crossroads special but we've had less room in the budget for scholarships. </p>
<p>We have a stack of applications from people who really want to come to the conference but can't otherwise afford to, and without your help, we don't know how we'll get them here.</p>
<p>The applicants this year come from as far away as California and Philadelphia, but most are from around the Southeast--Alabama, Florida, Atlanta, Savannah and middle Georgia--which has been hit hard by the economic downturn. </p>
<p>So whether you like writing, reading or just helping people accomplish their dreams--as cheesy as it may be to say aloud--then this is a great opportunity for you. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<ul>
<li>We have almost 75 applications for scholarships. To bring even 50 of them to the conference would cost more than $6000. </li>
<li>The cost of designing and printing a first run for the Guide will cost almost $2000, which is a bargin. </li>
<li>If we go over our goal, we'll split the amount between our scholarship fund for next year and the Young Writers Program, operated by the Office of Letters &amp; Light, as a way to get high school students into National Novel Writing Month.</li>
<li>If we don't get to our goal, we'll put the money towards as many scholarships as we can afford. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Starting with the $15 level donation, you get a copy of the Guide to the Writing Life, which will be jam-packed with great stuff from the conference with special extras. </p>
<p>Have a question you desperately (or at least somewhat) need answered? Well you could have your question--and your picture--in this first Guide to the Writing Life, answered by a pro.</p>
<p>Like our kickass poster? Well, you can get a special edition print autographed by all our presenting writers.</p>
<p>Forget writing, you just want a good burger. In fact, you want a burger named for you. Well, make a big enough donation and have one of the best burgers in town named for you at The Rookery. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here's why these writers can't come to the conference without your help:</p>
<ul>
<li>""I'm trying to climb out from under a mountain of debt. I'm also trying to save to pay cash for a car since I had to recently junk my car.""</li>
<li>""I am homemaker (not by choice) and my husband works two jobs to support us. I am still very new to the writing experience and really need to hone my craft.""</li>
<li>""I am a person who is legally blind. who is unemployed.""</li>
<li>""I have been laid off numerous times in the past few years... In the meantime, I've only been able to find part-time minimum-wage jobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's why they say it's so important for them to attend: </p>
<ul>
<li>""Truly if I could anything that I wanted, it would be to write.  Unfortunately, real life interferes with that since my priority has to be helping to support my family.""</li>
<li>""I would like to attend Crossroads for the infectious atmosphere that occurs with listening to, learning from, sitting next to and conversing with people who love to read and write just as much as you do.""</li>
<li>""This conference will allow me to meet other local writers and help build my confidence to complete a novel and publish it.""</li>
<li>""I'd like to meet more writers and become part of a larger community. Writing has mostly been an isolated experience for me and I'm only vaguely aware of what the writing community has to offer.""</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know you aren't rolling in dough, but you can still help. If you know someone--an individual, an organizaton or a business--that might want to help, let us know. <br/><br/>And please share our project with your friends. This can make a real difference in a lot of lives. You can be part of that.</p>

<h2><strong><em>There is nothing convenient about being part of an uncommon move of God.</em></strong></h2>
<div>
<p>When you know that God has called you to do something you have two choices.  Make the decision to do it, or the excuse not to.  I had spent many years doing the latter.  Not in a blatant way.  More along the ""I can make a rationalization to make myself believe it"" sort of way.</p>
<p>My solution?  Write a book!  It's really God's solution...and here's why:</p>
<p>This book is about breaking free from everything that keeps holding you back.  It's not a self-help, here are the easy steps to prosperity, type of book.  In fact, if you are really interested in living out God's call on your life it is going to be harder sooner than later.</p>
<p>This is about being willing to have your life called out.  Everything, and I mean everything, called on the carpet.  To step out in faith that where God is calling you to, you will go.  No matter what.  To living a life sold out to the vision God has for your life instead of the ""safe"" version you are living now.  You know, the life that everytime you seem to get ahead something happens to knock you back.  </p>
<p>There is a reason for that.  If you are living outside of the the divine purpose God has for you it's not a matter of if...but when the house of cards will fold around you.</p>
<p>I know.  I've been there.  It's why I am here now. The message God laid on my heart when I read Haggai 1:9 changed everything for me.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why Now?</h2>
I want to be very clear from the start.  When I say <strong><em>There is nothing convenient about being part of an umcommon move of</em></strong><em> God</em>, I mean it.<br/><p>I quit my job to write this book.</p>
<p>Not to be rogue and careless.  But rather to be intentional and obedient to the call God has placed on my life.</p>
<p><strong>This campaign is to raise money to support my writing this book from the start.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>You can LITERALLY help me write this book!</strong></h2>
<p>As I write this book I want you to be part of it.  Every step of the way.  This process will be an opportunity for you to journey with me as the book comes to life.  You will be able to follow my Come Back Bringing blog and add your feedback.  Share insights, ideas and get a behind the scenes view into the entire process.  We'll also partner in prayer, honoring God every single step of the way.</p>
<p>You will hear my heart.  The good days, the bad days and the hard days along the way. This book is going to the be the result of all of our obedience combined.  As God leads you to support the book and this movement you allow me to respond to the call God has placed on my life.</p>
<p>This book is about all of us.</p>
<p>Where we are now.  Where we need to be.  And how God is going to take us all there.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Your Response.</h2>
<p>Would you walk WITH me?  Would you pray and respond to what God is asking of you to see this book come to life and this movement sweep our nation?</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of my life.  Many of you have prayed for this very day.  I wouldn't be here without those prayers.  Many of you have never met me, yet you know God is asking you to partner with me.</p>
<p>I look forward to walking this road with all of you.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Campaign.</h2>
<p>From the moment Haggai spoke the words that God has asked him to deliver to the time the people were obediently moving, responding and getting involved in God's vision for their life was specific.</p>
<p>It was 21 days.</p>
<p>Everything changed during that time.</p>
<p>So this campaign will be open for 21 days.</p>
<p>Will you partner with me?  Will you share this with everyone you know to do the same?</p>
<div> </div>

</div></div>","There is nothing convenient about being part of an uncommon move of God.

When you know that God has called you to do something you have two choices.  Make the decision to do it, or the excuse not to.  I had spent many years doing the latter.  Not in a blatant way.  More along the ""I can make a rationalization to make myself believe it"" sort of way.
My solution?  Write a book!  It's really God's solution...and here's why:
This book is about breaking free from everything that keeps holding you back.  It's not a self-help, here are the easy steps to prosperity, type of book.  In fact, if you are really interested in living out God's call on your life it is going to be harder sooner than later.
This is about being willing to have your life called out.  Everything, and I mean everything, called on the carpet.  To step out in faith that where God is calling you to, you will go.  No matter what.  To living a life sold out to the vision God has for your life instead of the ""safe"" version you are living now.  You know, the life that everytime you seem to get ahead something happens to knock you back.  
There is a reason for that.  If you are living outside of the the divine purpose God has for you it's not a matter of if...but when the house of cards will fold around you.
I know.  I've been there.  It's why I am here now. The message God laid on my heart when I read Haggai 1:9 changed everything for me.
 
Why Now?
I want to be very clear from the start.  When I say There is nothing convenient about being part of an umcommon move of God, I mean it.I quit my job to write this book.
Not to be rogue and careless.  But rather to be intentional and obedient to the call God has placed on my life.
This campaign is to raise money to support my writing this book from the start.
 
You can LITERALLY help me write this book!
As I write this book I want you to be part of it.  Every step of the way.  This process will be an opportunity for you to journey with me as the book comes to life.  You will be able to follow my Come Back Bringing blog and add your feedback.  Share insights, ideas and get a behind the scenes view into the entire process.  We'll also partner in prayer, honoring God every single step of the way.
You will hear my heart.  The good days, the bad days and the hard days along the way. This book is going to the be the result of all of our obedience combined.  As God leads you to support the book and this movement you allow me to respond to the call God has placed on my life.
This book is about all of us.
Where we are now.  Where we need to be.  And how God is going to take us all there.
 
Your Response.
Would you walk WITH me?  Would you pray and respond to what God is asking of you to see this book come to life and this movement sweep our nation?
Thank you for being part of my life.  Many of you have prayed for this very day.  I wouldn't be here without those prayers.  Many of you have never met me, yet you know God is asking you to partner with me.
I look forward to walking this road with all of you.
 
The Campaign.
From the moment Haggai spoke the words that God has asked him to deliver to the time the people were obediently moving, responding and getting involved in God's vision for their life was specific.
It was 21 days.
Everything changed during that time.
So this campaign will be open for 21 days.
Will you partner with me?  Will you share this with everyone you know to do the same?

And that brings us to today.  This campaign.  The movement that I believe God is going to sweep our nation with.  The words He has asked me to write.  
And that is where you come in.

This movement will require sacrifice and inconvenience for all of us. But at the other end of the obedience to respond to what God is asking of us I believe is a game changing, world changing movement.
There is nothing convenient about being part of an uncommon move of God.

I want uncommon. 
I want to see God move in a way only He can.

<h2>Hi. My name is Ted, and I've written a story I'd like to share with you.</h2>
<p>It's a nonprofit novel, a tale of murder, mystery and redemption in the slums of Haiti. It's a story about two kids fighting against staggering odds to right a sickening wrong. And here's the kicker--it's not going to happen without you.</p>
<p>Just getting to this point has been a long journey. I started writing while working in Haiti in 2010 for a human rights organization in Bwa Nef, the slum community where the story is set.

<h2>Why tell this story?</h2>
<p>Circumstances in Haiti demanded it. During my four months there, Haiti was buffeted by a major hurricane, the return of a brutal dictator, protests surrounding national elections, and the outbreak of imported cholera that continues to kill in droves—and all of this just months after the most unimaginable human loss in the January 2010 earthquake. I wanted to tell a story set against this incredible and heartwrenching backdrop.</p>
<h2>Why should I read<em> Because We Are</em>?</h2>
<p>Libéte--the main character (pictured on the cover). The book is really about her journey, of struggling against staggering difficulty and danger to solve a grisly murder. The book uses flashbacks to weave together a complex narrative of intersecting themes, characters and events that make her life just as fascinating as the underlying mystery. Why is Libéte who she is? What transformed her from a sweet little girl into a firecracker? What gives her such resolve to reach the mystery's end? Jumping between past and present begs new questions that drive the narrative forward as you discover more and more about this remarkable little girl.</p>

I am an up and coming writer/director/producer and theatre trained actress.  The Love Sex &amp; Baggage concept initially started out as a web talk show idea</font><font size=""+0""> last year and has evolved into this wonderful masterpiece that I have spent the past nine months working on.  I have plans to further take some of the stories from the book and turn them into short films to be submitted to local, regional, and national film festivals; and your contributions can pave the way for those goals to come to fruition.</font></font></font></p>

<p><font size=""2"">This book is NOT your grandma's love story.  It is thought provoking, jaw dropping, erotic and intense.  From the first few pages, you will find yourself sitting on the edge of your bed with anticipation to see what happens next.  This book highlights the challenges we all face in relationships but set in situations that may be unconventional  to some.  As an artist, I pride myself on thinking outside of the box and I hope you will join me outside of it as well.</font></p>

Hello, my name is Tiera Nicole.  I would like to first say thank you for showing an interest in my campaign.  You will never fully understand what this means to me. I am an up and coming writer/director/producer and theatre trained actress.  The Love Sex & Baggage concept initially started out as a web talk show idea last year and has evolved into this wonderful masterpiece that I have spent the past nine months working on.  I have plans to further take some of the stories from the book and turn them into short films to be submitted to local, regional, and national film festivals; and your contributions can pave the way for those goals to come to fruition.
 
This book is NOT your grandma's love story.  It is thought provoking, jaw dropping, erotic and intense.  From the first few pages, you will find yourself sitting on the edge of your bed with anticipation to see what happens next.  This book highlights the challenges we all face in relationships but set in situations that may be unconventional  to some.  As an artist, I pride myself on thinking outside of the box and I hope you will join me outside of it as well.

LOVE IS BEAUTY
 
""We said our last goodbyes to the lingering guests and walked to the valet to retrieve our car.  I hadnï¿½t realized how sleepy I was until I snuggled into the passenger seat and Larry started caressing my leg.  Although we only had about a thirty minute drive home, I closed my eyes and decided to enjoy a small cat nap because I knew once we got in the house, Larry would pounce all over me and I would need all the rest I could get.  I had just nestled into a good sleep when I heard the tires of the car screech and I jolted out of my slumber just in time to see a tree collide with the front of our car.  I donï¿½t recall an impact but I do remember hearing my name being screamed over and over.
 
ï¿½ZAHRIA! ZAHRIA! BABY CAN YOU HEAR ME?!! PLEASE ANSWER ME BABY!! Iï¿½M SORRY BABY! ANSWER ME PLEASE!ï¿½
 
I finally came to and screamed out in agony as the pain seared through my body. ï¿½Larry,ï¿½ I whimpered weakly.  ï¿½I canï¿½t feel my legs. I canï¿½t feel my legs.ï¿½
 
ï¿½Itï¿½s ok baby. Itï¿½s ok.  Hold my hand,ï¿½ he reached out his bloody hand and grabbed mine. ï¿½Help is on the way.  Itï¿½ll be ok. Itï¿½ll be ok.  Just talk to me, Zah,ï¿½ he said through tears. ï¿½Zahria?! Zahria?! ZAHRIA PLEASE SAY SOMETHING! Please donï¿½t leave me! Iï¿½m sorry!ï¿½
 
 
BAGGAGE TO DIE FOR
 

""When I finished, the floor and newspapers were soaked in gasoline.  I said a quick prayer that the gas stove upstairs had been running long enough to fill the house by now and do what we needed it to do.  I sat down next to her and she was still trembling, so I wrapped my arms around her and held her tight. ï¿½I'll love you forever.  Amen,ï¿½ I whispered in her ear as I lit the match.""

<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: 'times new roman'; font-size: large; border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"">I sit in public and private settings with a 1917 Corona typewriter and a sign that reads, ""Poems about anyone or anything"". People come and make their request, and I type a poem for them.  I call this process of writing, Poeming.  I started poeming ten years ago.  It started as a party game, a way to flirt, a way to make people smile.  Now its a lifestyle, a passion that has saved me from deep depression and isolation.  It is a unique way of sharing love, of providing blessing.  It has given me the greatest sense of peace I've known; despite that I've been living in a van and basically homeless the whole time.</font></span></h3>

I sit in public and private settings with a 1917 Corona typewriter and a sign that reads, ""Poems about anyone or anything"". People come and make their request, and I type a poem for them.  I call this process of writing, Poeming.  I started poeming ten years ago.  It started as a party game, a way to flirt, a way to make people smile.  Now its a lifestyle, a passion that has saved me from deep depression and isolation.  It is a unique way of sharing love, of providing blessing.  It has given me the greatest sense of peace I've known; despite that I've been living in a van and basically homeless the whole time.

I'm very good at empathizing with people and space.  So many of these poems don't get posted online because they draw so much nuance form the moment, that you ""had to be there"" for the beauty of it to be fully felt.  If you read it you'd think ""What?"", while the person it was written for would be in tears. This is why ultimately it has to be Video taped, so that you can witness the environment and exchange the poem speaks for.  Please check out my website to get a sense of this work and know how this is true. www.poemswhileyouwait.com 

 
WHAT THIS PROJECT NEEDS:

A COMPUTER

   This project has accumulated well over a thousand poems and some twenty hours of video.  I do not have the basic tools I need to process all this work. A computer will allow me to process this material, create and maintain an effective website on which to share all this work, sell products and promote services.  It will allow me to create weekly entries on the wonderful life of poetry on the streets.  It will also allow me to start producing and sharing video.

VIDEO RESOURCES: Gopro camera, Microphone, etcUltimately this project NEEDS to be documented on video.  I can not emphasize this enough.  The poems that come out of this process are very good, it’s true, but the interactions that occur around the poems are real gold.  Most everyday people shed tears of laughter, love, and release.  I'm so good at giving voice to their personal sentiments, that many of these poems don't really stand alone, and are not posted, because they reference, and draw their nuance, from the conversation, both spoken and silent, between me and my audience.  IT NEEDS TO BE DOCUMENTED.BOOKMAKING RESOURCES: Printer, Paper cutter, booklet stapler,etc.
Without writing another poem, I’ve enough material to make no less then ten books of twenty poems each, all of the quality found on my current site, www.poemswhileyouwait.com.  Most of the hundred plus poems on that site I would deem book worthy, and keep in mind I have several hundred more to go through. I've not even gone through all the poems from two months of poeming in Portland (summer 2010), or Burning Man 2010, I've gone through little more then half the poems from Paia this past winter and only just cracked the nut on the summer collection from here in Boulder, Plus a bunch more from various places and times.  There's a lot of work here.Having a computer, printer and proper book making supplies will give me the ability to create endless quick-books, hand-made chapbooks, and greeting cards.  I will also make two hundred stab-and-stitch books of fine paper, cloth, photos, and decorated with love.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.mariecuriealumni.eu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Marie Curie Alumni Association</a>, representing over 8,000 outstanding researchers, is excited to launch the first book of the illustrated series, <i>My Super Science Heroes</i>, for kids aged 5-9 years.</p>
<p>The first book, <i>Marie Curie and the Power of Persistence</i>, uses a novel storytelling approach to bring this historical figure to life for readers both young and old. Written and illustrated as a dynamic superhero story, this book introduces children to important scientists and their key accomplishments in a fun and engaging way.</p>
<p>Children are constantly exposed to superhero role models who rely on supernatural powers, something to which kids cannot relate. By focusing on the scientist’s key personality trait—in this case, <strong>persistence</strong>—and that role in the heroes' success, we show children that great achievement is not limited to a select group of masterminds, but rather is within the reach of anyone.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494319797/xisfhva4pv3ctgjlbf7u.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Superheroes are important role models for children and this book series will introduce the young readers to the achievements of great scientists such as Marie Curie in a fun and engaging way. It will help children understand that, unlike being bitten by a radioactive spider, scientific achievement is a realistic goal, and celebrating these real-life heroes will encourage kids to explore the many possibilities a STEM program offers.</p>
<p>With <strong>your help</strong>, we can bring <i>Marie Curie and the Power of Persistence</i> into classrooms and onto bookshelves around the world to inspire a new generation of thinkers who can <strong>persist</strong> and save the day!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494319874/mdwlbkpn8scgmz9uaavu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Marie Curie and the Power of Persistence</i> is not the first book to highlight the achievements of Marie Curie, but it is the first book to highlight <strong>her superhero powers</strong>. </p>
<p>Children love epic adventures complete with heroes, villains, and incredible superpowers. This book delivers all of that with dynamic and infectious energy.</p>
<p>With the rapid growth of technological and scientific development, it is imperative that all children be exposed to the power of science as early and as often as possible.</p>
<p>When Marie Curie Researcher, Sebastiano Garroni, brought his four-year-old daughter into his lab and asked if she wanted to be a researcher like her dad, she replied, ""Sure Dad, but sorry, researchers are men and I am a little girl"".

Short Summary
The Marie Curie Alumni Association, representing over 8,000 outstanding researchers, is excited to launch the first book of the illustrated series, My Super Science Heroes, for kids aged 5-9 years.
The first book, Marie Curie and the Power of Persistence, uses a novel storytelling approach to bring this historical figure to life for readers both young and old. Written and illustrated as a dynamic superhero story, this book introduces children to important scientists and their key accomplishments in a fun and engaging way.
Children are constantly exposed to superhero role models who rely on supernatural powers, something to which kids cannot relate. By focusing on the scientist’s key personality trait—in this case, persistence—and that role in the heroes' success, we show children that great achievement is not limited to a select group of masterminds, but rather is within the reach of anyone.

Superheroes are important role models for children and this book series will introduce the young readers to the achievements of great scientists such as Marie Curie in a fun and engaging way. It will help children understand that, unlike being bitten by a radioactive spider, scientific achievement is a realistic goal, and celebrating these real-life heroes will encourage kids to explore the many possibilities a STEM program offers.
With your help, we can bring Marie Curie and the Power of Persistence into classrooms and onto bookshelves around the world to inspire a new generation of thinkers who can persist and save the day!

 
The Impact
 

Marie Curie and the Power of Persistence is not the first book to highlight the achievements of Marie Curie, but it is the first book to highlight her superhero powers. 
Children love epic adventures complete with heroes, villains, and incredible superpowers. This book delivers all of that with dynamic and infectious energy.
With the rapid growth of technological and scientific development, it is imperative that all children be exposed to the power of science as early and as often as possible.
When Marie Curie Researcher, Sebastiano Garroni, brought his four-year-old daughter into his lab and asked if she wanted to be a researcher like her dad, she replied, ""Sure Dad, but sorry, researchers are men and I am a little girl"". Marie Curie is a perfect example of what anyone, especially four year-old litle girls, can achieve with a bit of enthusiasm, knowledge, and devotion to science.
Marie is exactly the type of role model we need to make science an exciting adventure for kids.

Since the beginning of 2010, she has spent countless of hours developing new characters and thinking of what a big impact they could have on the world...despite them being small enough to live inside of snow globes.</p>
<p>Jackson's book takes a look at what it would be like if creatures actually did live within each snow globe. Those snow globes that you see in gift shops? There are living creatures in there known as <i>Globelings</i>. This 237 paged novel focuses on the young, timid globeling named Cirrus, who lives in Cloudscape Town; a snow globe decorated with the theme of the sky. When Cirrus isolates himself in his bedroom after shaming the name of his family owned bakery, he looks to his favorite video game for comfort, but soon enough he will not be able to tell the difference between his games or reality. When the main villain from the game, known as the Poison Prince, interferes with Cloudscape Town and threatens to make everything rotten, it's up to Cirrus to venture to the other snow globes on the shelf in order to find the special ingredients for the legendary recipe, The Greatest Cake of the Globes.<br/><br/></p>

<i>“I know you want to bake, son, but....” Atmo was about to admit that his
son's baking was horrendous, but he refrained and changed the subject. “What’s
there to be social about anyway?” Atmo chuckled as he glanced over to Stara.
“Really now, you don’t have to strike up a speech. You're not gonna try and
pitch an idea for company or anything. You can just say things like 'hi' or
'how are you', 'can I help you', 'have a good day' and so on. 'How’s the
weather' is a good topic. Little things, son. That is all.”</i></span></p><i>
</i><p><i><span> 
“I know, I know..,” Cirrus continued to look high-strung. “I just always
get this feeling of panic in my stomach and I forget what to say and then I end
up freezing up. I’m a failed raindrop since I always turn into a snowflake.”
His head fell and hit the counter again—several pastries and candies behind the
counter glass shook from the impact.</span></i></p><i>

“Stop doing that, sweetie! You are going to form a bump on your head.”
Stara said as she tugged on his short, purple ponytail. Just then a young woman
who had been browsing the cakes near the bakery window started to approach the
counter. She made eye contact with Cirrus and his parents. </span></i></p><i>

“Oh, just in time. I think we’ve got ourselves a customer!” Stara
whispered in Cirrus's ear. She glanced at her husband and flicked her head back
toward the kitchen as if she were hinting toward something sneaky. Atmo subtly
nodded and they both quickly took off to the kitchen and shut the door behind
them.</span></i></p><i>

“Now’s your chance, big boy!” Atmo said through the kitchen panel. </span></i></p><i>
<span>  “W-W-WHAT?”
Cirrus shot up from the counter and tried to push his way back into the
kitchen, but his parents held the door on him. “Mom! Dad! I don’t know what to
do!” Cirrus's heart stopped as he watched the young woman approach the counter.

Since the beginning of 2010, she has spent countless of hours developing new characters and thinking of what a big impact they could have on the world...despite them being small enough to live inside of snow globes.
Jackson's book takes a look at what it would be like if creatures actually did live within each snow globe. Those snow globes that you see in gift shops? There are living creatures in there known as Globelings. This 237 paged novel focuses on the young, timid globeling named Cirrus, who lives in Cloudscape Town; a snow globe decorated with the theme of the sky. When Cirrus isolates himself in his bedroom after shaming the name of his family owned bakery, he looks to his favorite video game for comfort, but soon enough he will not be able to tell the difference between his games or reality. When the main villain from the game, known as the Poison Prince, interferes with Cloudscape Town and threatens to make everything rotten, it's up to Cirrus to venture to the other snow globes on the shelf in order to find the special ingredients for the legendary recipe, The Greatest Cake of the Globes.

<p>Personally, activism is a journey that I have walked all my life. Thirty 
years ago I was just an ordinary girl, bright girl as most people called me. I 
was a little girl in a family of four boys and two girls. My sister left home 
when I was still young so I grew up the only girl among the boys.</p>
<p>It was not easy growing up with the boys; I had to fight for everything 
because I always came second. I used to see my mother fight for me also, so me 
and my mother became a team. Silently, without anyone's knowledge, this struggle 
against the boys aroused something in me. Nobody knew the pledge that I made to 
myself secretly so many years ago as a little harmless girl. Nobody realized the 
time bomb that began ticking that very time when I had to fight for myself all 
the time.</p>
<p>That experience at home toughened me up and I vowed to prove my worth to boys 
and men. That time I just didn’t know how. But I knew the day would come when I 
would stand up and unleash my voice to be heard and also have people not only 
listen but pay attention.</p>
<p>I then became a journalist because I thought journalists have the most power 
to speak to people. To change mindsets, but the day I walked into the newsroom 
it was full of men. Oh what I experienced in that newsroom everyday was just a 
perfect replay of that dreadful experience at home only with a different setting 
and a new plot this time.</p>
<p>The newsroom was dominated by men and you could really feel that you are a 
woman. The guys in the newsroom would make you feel that a woman is for sure 
meant to respect and honour men. I became even more determined to fight for 
equality between men and women. To change the mindset that women are nothing but 
good household players.</p>
<p>I thought to myself, I can use the same newsroom to change people's mindsets. 
I can make journalism work for women. But with all those men in charge, who 
would listen to woman trying to change 'the way things should be in society'? 
This was when I realized that no matter how much power journalists have, I can 
never be an activist from inside the newsroom. My experience at home and in the 
newsroom propelled the birth of Women Empowerment Foundation Scribes
Africa.</p>
<p>I created my own space to speak to the world. To speak on behalf of other 
women whose voices are being silenced every day, women who are made to believe 
that they are incapable and less adequate. I ask myself every time, do you have 
to be a man in order to be human enough?</p>
<p>I look back at how patriarchy and harmful traditional beliefs transformed a 
shy girl into a strong woman who is determined to have her voice heard. Being an

<p>Many of us are active in our local Yes campaigns but we come together as
AFIS to ensure that our communities are fully engaged in the debate on
Independence.</p>
<p>There are an estimated 22,000 Africans able to vote in this referendum.
Nobody else is engaging with them. If we can convince the majority to vote Yes,
it can tip the balance. Africans living in Scotland could make a significant
difference to Scotland's fortunes simply by marking an X in a box. We need to
let them know how important their vote is.</p>
<p>We plan to stick around after Independence to ensure Africans become
properly engaged in the political process.</p>
<p><b>What we've done so far ...</b></p>
<p><b>We have produced</b> a 4 page leaflet
aimed at African communities in English, French and Arabic. You can read it in
the gallery or click here where you’ll find more info on our blog.</p>
<p><b>We have held public
meetings</b> in Glasgow and Dundee. We have spoken at Yes meetings in Dumfries,
Glasgow, Edinburgh, Elgin, Buckie, Stirling, Aberdeen.</p>
<p><b>We have distributed
our leaflets</b> to Yes campaigns in areas where there are is an African population. We
have distributed them to African shops, community centres &amp; restaurants. We
have stood outside African churches and spoken to people as they come out. We
have a good online presence on Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p><b>We have recruited a
number of official AFIS Ambassadors</b>. We equip them with our leaflet in
different languages, badges, posters and Yes information. Their role is to
speak to other African and Caribbean people about why they are voting YES and
to answer or find answers to any questions they may have. They do this
primarily by visiting people in their homes.</p>
<p><b>What w</b><b>e need your money for</b></p>
<p>The way to engage with the African communities is face to face. The way
to meet them is to go to where they are. We have been and we ARE doing that but
we need to step it up now and we need to systematically visit every single
African household we are aware of.</p>
<p>In the final week we want to have a much larger network of AFIS
activists spending every day visiting African friends, neighbours, community
groups, shops, restaurants etc and proactively engaging in the discussion about
Independence.</p>
<p>We know of passionate Yes supporting Africans but we just don’t have
time to recruit, maintain and equip as many of them as we know we can.</p>
<p>We want to do this systematically leaving no stone unturned. So we want
to <b>appoint a paid (for one week)
co-ordinator </b>in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee and Perth. </p>
<p>We also want to <b>buy travel passes</b>
for our unpaid Ambassadors so that there are no restrictions on them because of
travel costs.</p>
<p>If an African or Caribbean person invites you to their home, they feed
you. We have people willing to host house meetings for up to ten of their
undecided friends and we want to cover their costs.</p>
<p><b>Why pay
co-ordinators? Why cover travel costs?</b></p>
<p>To understand our biggest barrier to campaigning you need to understand
the make up of our communities in Scotland. There are financial barriers to
political engagement for us. There are two main reasons for this. </p>
<p>1) Many of our activists are professionals on decent salaries but
because of VISA restrictions they MUST earn over a certain level and they MUST
have a certain amount in their bank accounts at all times. If they do not, they
risk being told to leave the country. Given that many of them have married
here, had children here, you can imagine how seriously they view those risks.
So, often, our activists are unable to do much other than work in order to
maintain minimum salary and savings levels. (Incidentally the Scottish
Government's white paper pledges to review those levels which are currently set
at London level.)</p>
<p>2) Many of our activists are unemployed or working for minimum wages.
This is the same for many people in Scotland but moreso for the African
communities and as we have a smaller pool of people to recruit activists from,
it's a bigger problem in terms of political activity. We also have activists
who are asylum seekers living on less than average benefits and not allowed to
work. We cannot pay them but we can cover their travel costs.</p>
<p><b>What else do you
need money for?</b></p>
<p>We have a beautiful logo designed for us by our friend James Kennedy. By
popular demand we produced badges and T shirts but now we want to feature the
logo in a poster urging everyone to Vote Yes. We can have this done for a relatively
low cost and if we’ve any money left over we’ll get more badges – they went
like hot cakes!</p>
<p><b>Is there any point
in looking for funding at this late stage?</b></p>
<p>We know how Crowdfunding works. As soon as we launch this funding
appeal, we will know if it's working. We won't receive the money until the end
of the appeal but we can recruit our co-ordinators as long as we see that the
money is pledged. Our members will use their own funds or credit facilities to
pay for travel passes for the other activists and we will refund them once the
funding comes through.</p>
<p><b>So, we’re all ready
to implement our strategy, and we’ll start to work our way through our
priorities as soon as money starts to be pledged. </b>For example,
because of population size, a Glasgow co-ordinator is the first priority.</p>
<p><b>What if there’s
money left over</b></p>
<p>We’re planning to spend as much money as possible to ensure we make a significant
difference to the outcome of the vote. However, as we said, we intend to
continue as an organisation after Independence. We want to participate in the
written constitution, we want African people to be more engaged in the political
process. So any left over money we will use to enable us to do that. </p>
<p>We will also donate some of the left over money (if there is any) to some
African churches in Scotland who have set up foodbanks for local people.</p>
<p><b>Whatever you can
give, please do. We will spend it wisely and we are ready for the final last intensive
push, the minute the donations start coming in. Thank you!</b></p><p></p></div>","Who are we and what do we do
Africans for an Independent Scotland
(AFIS) is a group of African, Caribbean and Afro Scots people living in
Scotland and campaigning for Scotland's Independence. 
We all come originally from countries
which gained their Independence. Our African and Caribbean gardens are not all
rosy but that is not because of Independence and you can trust us when we say
that none of our countries have EVER wanted to go back to being ruled by
another country.
What is AFIS all about?

Many of us are active in our local Yes campaigns but we come together as
AFIS to ensure that our communities are fully engaged in the debate on
Independence.
There are an estimated 22,000 Africans able to vote in this referendum.
Nobody else is engaging with them. If we can convince the majority to vote Yes,
it can tip the balance. Africans living in Scotland could make a significant
difference to Scotland's fortunes simply by marking an X in a box. We need to
let them know how important their vote is.
We plan to stick around after Independence to ensure Africans become

What we've done so far ...
We have produced a 4 page leaflet

We have held public
meetings in Glasgow and Dundee. We have spoken at Yes meetings in Dumfries,
Glasgow, Edinburgh, Elgin, Buckie, Stirling, Aberdeen.
We have distributed
our leaflets to Yes campaigns in areas where there are is an African population. We
have distributed them to African shops, community centres & restaurants. We
have stood outside African churches and spoken to people as they come out. We
have a good online presence on Facebook and Twitter.
We have recruited a
number of official AFIS Ambassadors. We equip them with our leaflet in
different languages, badges, posters and Yes information. Their role is to
speak to other African and Caribbean people about why they are voting YES and
to answer or find answers to any questions they may have. They do this
primarily by visiting people in their homes.
What we need your money for
The way to engage with the African communities is face to face. The way
to meet them is to go to where they are. We have been and we ARE doing that but
we need to step it up now and we need to systematically visit every single
African household we are aware of.
In the final week we want to have a much larger network of AFIS
activists spending every day visiting African friends, neighbours, community
groups, shops, restaurants etc and proactively engaging in the discussion about

If an African or Caribbean person invites you to their home, they feed

Why pay
co-ordinators? Why cover travel costs?
To understand our biggest barrier to campaigning you need to understand
the make up of our communities in Scotland. There are financial barriers to
political engagement for us. There are two main reasons for this. 
1) Many of our activists are professionals on decent salaries but
because of VISA restrictions they MUST earn over a certain level and they MUST
have a certain amount in their bank accounts at all times. If they do not, they
risk being told to leave the country. Given that many of them have married

2) Many of our activists are unemployed or working for minimum wages.
This is the same for many people in Scotland but moreso for the African

it's a bigger problem in terms of political activity. We also have activists
who are asylum seekers living on less than average benefits and not allowed to

need money for?

<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">I am a climber that writes about my passion for climbing. I have wanted to climb El Capitan for years. So I set a goal to lose 40 pounds in Oct 2012 and then climb El Capitan in Yosemite California.</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>I worked hard to lose the weight and had the help of a coach and used the P90X program as a guide to lose the weight and build my body for the challenge. I have lost 48 pounds since Feb 2013 and now am in the best shape of my life.</p>
<p>The blog is at OregonLive.com. The blog address is: blog.OregonLive.com/climbing</p>
<p>I have been writing all year on the blog about the process of training, losing the weight, the specific climbing training, about all the emotions ,trials, and tribulations.</p>
<p>I have been told by folks that this story has been very inspiring. I want to share the inspiration and passion with others. I have gotten support from local businesses for the gear that I will need, but coming down the wire the cash that I expected from one source is unavailable. I still have expenses for food on the climb on El Capitan. Then also while I am in Yosemite Valley preparing before and recovering from the climb.</p>
<p>I also have been promised $200 toward getting assistance from local climbers to portage my gear down from El Capitan. This can be the most dangerous part of the climb. As I will be completely wiped out after being 8 days on the climb. So I need $100 more dollars toward that expense as the rate is $3 a pound.</p>
<p>I will be climbing via solo aid climbing techniques that I have practiced over the last 4 years. I have the skill set to do all the climbing, but getting help with 100 pounds of my gear will be a bonus. Being that I am 50 years old and not 25 means that I do have a limit. El Capitan will take me to the limit.</p>
<p>My specific plan is laid out on my blog at:</p>

<p>I have set other goals for climbs in the past. 2 years ago I set a path to climb 100 Days 100 Miles and 100 Climbs in The Columbia River Gorge. I did this challenge from Oct 15th - Jan 23rd. I actually climbed 102. Two of the climbs were for extra credit. So I have a track record of finishing what I start.</p>

<p>**It is with gratitude, excitement, and a feeling of accomplishment that I’m happy to announce that my campaign goal has now been fully funded due to additional outside funding! I would like to thank my friends and family for coming together to support me on this endeavor. We couldn’t have done this without you!**</p>
<p>Journey to Generation Clash - The unique journey of the girl who always knew that she was different and became who she wanted to be.</p>
<p><br/>My name is Carmela Carr and I am the author of Journey to Generation Clash. I wrote this book because I knew from a young age that I wasn’t like other people. I was aware of how I felt, and I wondered why I wasn’t into what everyone else was into. I went through a big life change, and it gave me the time I needed to find myself and figure out who I was.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that different is cool. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for music in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you see that you’re not obligated to like something just because it’s popular, or because other people like it.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll get to read about my journey and find out how I was impacted by technology, music, and trends and how these things helped me to find myself.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Technology</strong> - I was given a Blackberry Bold 9930 when I was 13, and I started using it as an offline phone for listening to music, taking pictures, and writing memos, exclusively. It allowed me to use social media differently than most people. It allowed me to focus on what I was doing instead of what everyone else was doing.</li>
<li>
<strong>Music</strong> - I've always liked what was different. I wasn’t into what everyone else was into and I didn’t understand why until I got older. I started to find myself and I started finding all the bands I truly connected with and I became who I wanted to be. I found solace in the fact that they were different, and I was shown that different is cool.</li>
<li>
<strong>Trends</strong> - I saw popular trends and I didn’t see what everyone else saw in them. I naturally gravitated toward what was different, which led me to feeling conflicted. I felt this way because whenever I was hanging out with people my own age, I was only privy to what was popular. As I got older, I started to go through my dad’s extensive music collection, and I found out about countless artists that were overlooked commercially, but were great bands because they were different.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you love music, self-discovery, and digging deeper than the norm.<br/><br/>Journey to Generation Clash is a non-fiction book that speaks to young and old alike who carve their own path, instead of following in someone else's footsteps.</p>
<p><strong>The Book - Journey To Generation Clash</strong></p>
<p>The book is written in 3 Parts...<br/><br/>Part 1, known as “How We Got Here” includes the introduction and how I figured out that I wasn’t like everybody else. You’ll get to read about my early life and how my experiences shaped me. You’ll see how I started living in my own world, and how I gained a better understanding of who I was.<br/><br/>Part 2, known as “How To Become A Music Detective” is where you get to see how I took the experiences from my youth and I started to apply them. I started to embrace my open-mindedness and it allowed me to discover and rediscover the bands that no one I knew was talking about. I couldn’t help but think that I was finding all of these unique bands for a reason. You’ll get to see how I embraced having an open mind and how it resulted in me finding what I truly identified with.<br/><br/>Part 3, known as “How Do I Apply It”, which is where the reader gets to apply what I talk about. It allows you to not only read about how I figured out these unique methods, but how you can actually apply them to your own life.<br/><br/>I include my personal experiences in this book to show you that this can be done. This isn't a story of crazy coincidences. It's shows that it's important to focus on yourself first. Many people get misled because of what they think they should be doing. No one should ever do anything because someone else is doing it. It's cool to make your own decision, without being influenced by others.</p>
<p>This all started when I was a kid, and I wasn’t going to be like everyone else. I was surrounded by music my entire life, and I went through a big change at a young age which allowed me to focus on what I was supposed to be focusing on. Instead of focusing on the outside world, I was creating my own world and becoming who I wanted to be.</p>

<p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>
<p>Carmela Carr is the founder of the music blog, “Generation Clash”. She is also a writer for the “Odyssey” online, photographer for “Preservation Of Moments”, and she’s currently getting her associate’s degree in Business Management.<br/><br/>It has been said by many that she is ahead of the curve because of her passion for music, specifically how she is not only enthusiastic but knowledgeable about an era completely different than the one she was born in. She never hesitates to express her appreciation towards things that astound her because she believes that great things deserve to be acknowledged.<br/><br/>Carmela wrote this book because she feels that, “no one should ever feel like they have to be like everyone else. You have your own viewpoint, and we are individuals for a reason. It’s not easy to find ourselves, but it’s worth it knowing that you get to become who you want to be, instead of just another face in the crowd.”<br/><br/>She felt inclined to write this book because she always knew that she was different, and she wanted to show others that it’s okay to be different. Different is cool. She wants her readers to see that they shouldn’t just buy into what’s in front of them, and that they can dig deeper. As she’s found out, there are countless great bands out there, but they can only be found if you look. As they say, the best things are only found by digging deep.<br/><br/>Carmela is probably on Discogs as we speak. When she’s not buckling down to get college coursework done so she can get back to her music blog, she’s consistently writing down names of bands that stand out to her. She does this, hoping that she can find a way to hear their music. She also has a love for art, and she has her own original characters that she hopes become her trademark.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Carmela at thegenerationclash@gmail.com and<br/><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/carmelataranto/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/carmelataranto/</a><br/><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/retronautqueen"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.instagram.com/retronautqueen/</a><br/><a href=""https://twitter.com/retronaut_queen"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://twitter.com/retronaut_queen</a><br/><a href=""https://facebook.com/beradstaygroovy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://facebook.com/beradstaygroovy</a></p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Good Enough</i> is a story of hope and transformation to help you go from feeling unworthy and forgotten, to loved and cherished. In this book you will learn what it means to believe beautiful, how to recognize trauma in your life and welcome healing, and how to tear down walls of false narratives and replace them with powerful and true identity statements.</p>
<p>My name is Carly Newberg and I am the author of <i>Good Enough</i>. I wrote this book because for too long, I lived under the lie that I wasn’t enough—feeling like I had to prove myself and live up to lofty expectations my monsters, or rather the negative voices in my head, set in front of me. I lost friends, time, and memories, covered in shame and paralyzed by both depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you come to believe you are good enough. Through my own experience with trauma and an eating disorder I developed and later recovered from, I want to show you that beauty and joy can be found wherever you are, and in who you are. More than anything, I want you to no longer walk the world afraid of darkness and instead, be able to find light and restoration for your soul by embracing vulnerability.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unprocessed trauma and how it’s linked to unfinished healing.</li>
<li>False narratives we carry, also known as “monsters.”</li>
<li>Jesus and His inclusive message of hope and belonging.</li>
<li>Eating disorders and how to develop a healthy relationship with your mind and body.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If you’ve ever battled an eating disorder, dealt with body dysmorphia, poor body image, or thoughts of unworthiness, this book is for you.</p>
<p><i>Good Enough</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to anyone looking to develop a greater amount of self love, deepen their faith, or widen their understanding of eating disorders.</p>
<h3>The Book - <i>Good Enough</i>
</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 Parts....</p>
<p>Part 1: Family and Relationships contains the introduction + Chapters 1-6. In these chapters you will learn about my childhood history and the trauma I didn’t begin to work through until much later in life. I will share with you the divorce of my parents that took place when I was 8 years old and how their separation impacted not only my relationship with both of them and my older brother, but with myself. Alongside this story, I will share with you the testimony of my faith—how it lifted me up out my darkness and gave me strength. The point of Part 1 is to educate and give context for Parts 2 and 3. Along the way, you will be given insight and tools to apply to your own life.</p>

This is where I begin to dive deep into that feeling of not being enough, how it played out in my life and caused me to bear both shame and the heaviness of having to do everything on my own.

I want to walk beside you throughout the whole book, but especially in these final pages. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that healing is hard. You will see this as I share with you the steps I took to recover from an eating disorder and how my relationship with Jesus made the journey more within reach. In the final part of the book, I will show you from experience how to go from feeling alone, drenched in shame, and covered in lies to gracefully accepting the process, finding purpose, and discovering your true identity. In Part 3, you will learn what it means to believe beautiful.</p>

</div></div>","Story of My Book
Good Enough is a story of hope and transformation to help you go from feeling unworthy and forgotten, to loved and cherished. In this book you will learn what it means to believe beautiful, how to recognize trauma in your life and welcome healing, and how to tear down walls of false narratives and replace them with powerful and true identity statements.
My name is Carly Newberg and I am the author of Good Enough. I wrote this book because for too long, I lived under the lie that I wasn’t enough—feeling like I had to prove myself and live up to lofty expectations my monsters, or rather the negative voices in my head, set in front of me. I lost friends, time, and memories, covered in shame and paralyzed by both depression and anxiety.
My hope is that, in reading this book, you come to believe you are good enough. Through my own experience with trauma and an eating disorder I developed and later recovered from, I want to show you that beauty and joy can be found wherever you are, and in who you are. More than anything, I want you to no longer walk the world afraid of darkness and instead, be able to find light and restoration for your soul by embracing vulnerability.
In this book, you'll learn about:

Unprocessed trauma and how it’s linked to unfinished healing.
False narratives we carry, also known as “monsters.”
Jesus and His inclusive message of hope and belonging.
Eating disorders and how to develop a healthy relationship with your mind and body.

 
If you’ve ever battled an eating disorder, dealt with body dysmorphia, poor body image, or thoughts of unworthiness, this book is for you.
Good Enough is a non-fiction book that speaks to anyone looking to develop a greater amount of self love, deepen their faith, or widen their understanding of eating disorders.
The Book - Good Enough

The book is written in 3 Parts....
Part 1: Family and Relationships contains the introduction + Chapters 1-6. In these chapters you will learn about my childhood history and the trauma I didn’t begin to work through until much later in life. I will share with you the divorce of my parents that took place when I was 8 years old and how their separation impacted not only my relationship with both of them and my older brother, but with myself. Alongside this story, I will share with you the testimony of my faith—how it lifted me up out my darkness and gave me strength. The point of Part 1 is to educate and give context for Parts 2 and 3. Along the way, you will be given insight and tools to apply to your own life.
Part 2: Disasters and Disorders contains Chapters 7-12. This is where I begin to dive deep into that feeling of not being enough, how it played out in my life and caused me to bear both shame and the heaviness of having to do everything on my own. You will learn the details of my eating disorder and the many layers that contributed to the onset of it, some of which include emotional and verbal abuse, the comparison plague, a lack of affection and belonging, body dysmorphia, diet culture, and poor education. Part 2 is a vulnerable trek into the depths of my own emotional ache, and it will challenge you to confront the pain you carry, to view your story as a multidimensional puzzle with many pieces.
Part 3: Realizations and Transformations contains Chapters 13-18. Together, we will move forward as the foundation for healing starts to unfold. I want to walk beside you throughout the whole book, but especially in these final pages. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that healing is hard.

In Part 3, you will learn what it means to believe beautiful.

Pendant la nuit l’Aplacargo que Lorenzo Dorini avait conduite jusqu’à Barcelone à été vandalisé après une tentative de vol. Maintenant le vélo est à l'arrêt et il en est de même pour le projet de faire le tour du monde par étapes en partageant le même vélo. Mais comme toujours on regarde devant nous et on ne baisse pas la tête! Et encore une fois nous repartons en visant haut! Pour nous c'est un sale coup. La première Alpacargo à été violée, celle qui était née de la campagne de crouwd founding, de l’effort de tous ceux qui nous ont aidé à imaginer un moyen différent pour la mobilité urbaine. Ils ont attaqué, peut être sans le faire exprès, le symbole d’un projet collectif. Mais pas seulement. Le voyage de Lorenzo avait récemment pris fin. Il a rejoint Mantova à Barcelone en solo, pédalant parmi les champs de la vallée du Po, sur les pentes des Alpes, roulant sur les routes de la Cote Azure et de la Costa Brava suivi par le vent. Mais ce n'était que la première étape du voyage de l'Alpacargo. A la fin du mois d'octobre Federico aurait du reprendre le même vélo pour pédaler jusqu’à Valence chez Nacho. De là on ne sait pas combien des rues elle aurait pu parcourir, avec un cycliste toujours différent, jusqu’à rentrer à Trento après où elle est née. Malheureusement maintenant le vélo est inutilisable. Après cet acte de vandalisme on risque d’abandonner notre prototype et de dire adieu au rêve du voyage. On voulait voir l'Alpacargo faire le tour du monde et devenir la première cargobike partagée. En réponse à tout ça on a décidé de réagire à la manière de la CiclOstile Officina Popolare, on a décidé de partager ce qui s’est passé, on a décidé de ne pas baisser la tête et on demande une aide pour passer cette phase très difficile. Pour redonner la vie à la cargobike partagée on a besoin des composants et de la conscience collective qu’il pourra empêcher que cela ne se reproduise. Avec le projet Alpacargo on ne s’est pas enrichit, on n’a pas changé notre esprit. Alpacargo est née de l’effort collectif et partagé et on aimerait bien que tout ça puisse continuer. On à commencée une nouvelle campagne de crowd founding pour nous aider à faire repartir notre voyage. Mais cette fois on veut faire plus. Vu l’enthousiasme qui s’est crée au tour de l’expérience d’un voyage partagé, on vous dit que si on arrive à réparer Alpacargo on créera une page Facebook dans laquelle n’importe qui peut se proposer avec ses objectifs et ses intentions pour continuer à dessiner l'itinéraire d’un voyage qui vient seulement de commencer!!!

<h3>About me:</h3>
<p>As both a mother and a reading specialist, I am always looking for books that are fun and engaging for children. Studies have shown that the earlier parents start reading to their children can have a positive impact on their child's literacy and oral language skills.  Writing a book that has a rhythmic, predictable language helps children develop an awareness of language and builds fluency by allowing them to hear how words are read in phrases, rather than, word by word.  </p>
<p><i>What Do Dogs Do When You Go Off To School?</i> is being illustrated by Rachel Rodkey.  She is an innovative artist from the Pittsburgh area.  The illustrations will be brightly colored with a whimsical flair.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><i>What Do Dogs Dog When You Go Off To School?</i> has been a work of love for over a year.  The manuscript has been written and I am currently working with a local artist to procure the illustrations for the book.  I am trying to raise $5,500 in 60 days to help defray some of the publishing costs.  My hopes are to have the book published by May 2017.  All funds collected will go towards my goals.  </p>
<p>My goals are simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>$2,200-covers the publishing package</li>
<li>$1,300-covers the illustrations</li>
<li> $500- covers marketing expenses</li>
<li>$1,500-covers first bulk printing of <i>What Do Dogs Do When You Go Off To School?</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I would love for you to become part of my project by making a donation.  As a way to thank you for your contribution, I have come up with a number of exciting perks, such as, autographed <i>What Do Dogs Do When You Go Off To School?</i> books, hot off the press, signed prints, and merchandise adorned with the whimsical cover art.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your help, I will be able to make a larger impact on early literacy and  get my book out to into the world.  Giving children books that are both fun and engaging will help them develop a love of reading at an early age.  Children who love to read are exposed to many more words than their non-reading peers and are more likely to have a greater advantage in comprehension in years to come.  Children of all ages have been enjoying Dr. Seuss books for years.  <i>What Do Dogs Do When You Go Off To School?</i> has the same rhythm and essence as the books we have all grown up with.  With your help, my book has the ability to enjoy the same acclaim.  If you are unable to contribute to my campaign, not to worry, you can still support my project by getting the word out by using the Indiegogo share tools!  I look forward to partnering with you to make my dreams of becoming a published author a reality.  </p>

With your help, I will be able to make a larger impact on early literacy and  get my book out to into the world.  Giving children books that are both fun and engaging will help them develop a love of reading at an early age.  Children who love to read are exposed to many more words than their non-reading peers and are more likely to have a greater advantage in comprehension in years to come.  Children of all ages have been enjoying Dr. Seuss books for years.  What Do Dogs Do When You Go Off To School? has the same rhythm and essence as the books we have all grown up with.  With your help, my book has the ability to enjoy the same acclaim.  If you are unable to contribute to my campaign, not to worry, you can still support my project by getting the word out by using the Indiegogo share tools!  I look forward to partnering with you to make my dreams of becoming a published author a reality.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Chi sono</h3>
<p>Mi chiamo Isabella Pojavis e sono una scrittrice. Fino a qualche anno lavoravo come medico veterinario ma poi ho sentito il bisogno di un cambiamento e da circa due anni mi occupo a tempo pieno di scrittura (romanzi e racconti).</p>
<p>""Il giglio dai capelli rossi"" è un racconto nato dall'importanza che questo cambiamento ha avuto nella mia vita. L'ho pubblicato pochi mesi fa autonomamente su Amazon, ma purtroppo i costi di stampa sono molto elevati. Per questo, dopo aver venduto le prime 100 copie e aver ricevuto feed-back molto incoraggianti, sono qui per chiederti di aiutarmi a stampare 1000 copie di questo racconto (500 in italiano e 500 in spagnolo) in collaborazione con una casa editrice spagnola (El circulo rojo) che curerà l'aspetto grafico del testo, e che mi permetterà di ricevere un numero elevato di copie a un prezzo più contenuto. Questo mi consentirà di raggiungere un pubblico più vasto e quindi di ricevere un maggiore riscontro. Sto iniziando questo nuovo viaggio nella mia vita e ho bisogno de vostro appoggio per poter andare avanti e continuare questo cammino.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Di cosa ho bisogno e cosa riceverai</h3>
<p>La stampa per le 1000 copie ha un costo di 2200 euro che andranno direttamente all'editoriale ""El circulo rojo"". Il mio obiettivo è di raggiungere 2500 euro in modo da poter pagare le spese di stampa e della piattaforma di crowdfunding Indigogo (Nessuna parte del ricavato andrà direttamente a me, se non le copie fisiche del libro).</p>
<p>Se non raggiungo l'intera cifra i soldi vi verranno restituiti perchè 2500 euro è la cifra minima per effettuare la stampa.</p>
<p>Riceverete un minimo di tre copie direttamente a casa (motivo per cui vi verrà richiesto un indirizzo al momento del pagamento). </p>
<p>Indiegogo è una piattaforma estremamente sicura e non ci sono rischi nel fornire i vostri dati.</p>
<p>LA CAMPAGNA DURA SOLO 30 GIORNI, NON RIMANDARE</p>

<h3>L'impatto</h3>
<p>Il giglio dai capelli rossi è un racconto per me molto importante, non solo perché è la prima storia che ho scritto, ma anche perché mi ricorda l'importanza del cambiamento nella nostra vita e l'importanza del saperlo accettare come se fosse una nuova nascita. Chi lo ha letto lo ha definito un libro di auto-aiuto, io non so se difinirlo così però credo che sia un racconto che possa far vedere le cose in modo diverso. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Rischi e difficoltà</h3>
<p>""Il giglio dai capelli rossi"" è già stato stampato in precedenza quindi l'unico problema possibile nel ricevere le vostre copie potrebbe essere legato alle tempistiche di stampa della nuova editoriale (anche se questi sono stati presi in considerazione nelle date di consegna che ho inserito nella campagna).</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As a kid, I loved Jeri Massi's books. The Bridge, The Crown and Jewel, and Two Collars was my first introduction to the fantasy genre, and I loved every word. As I got older, I dreamed of some day being able to transform Jeri's books into something more: a movie, a radio drama, a stage play... I didn't care. I just wanted to be able to do more with this world she had created.</p>
<p>A couple months back, I had an opportunity to reach out to Jeri to express my appreciation for her and her work. She was very kind in responding to me and we began to talk about possibly making The Bridge into a radio drama.

</div></div>","Short Summary
As a kid, I loved Jeri Massi's books. The Bridge, The Crown and Jewel, and Two Collars was my first introduction to the fantasy genre, and I loved every word. As I got older, I dreamed of some day being able to transform Jeri's books into something more: a movie, a radio drama, a stage play... I didn't care. I just wanted to be able to do more with this world she had created.
A couple months back, I had an opportunity to reach out to Jeri to express my appreciation for her and her work. She was very kind in responding to me and we began to talk about possibly making The Bridge into a radio drama. One thing led to another and I now have the privilege of not only creating a radio drama for The Bridge, but also of promoting all her children's books. To that end, we are in need of new book covers and a marketing budget.
Here's where you come in. I'm sure you know how this works.
We're hoping to raise $5,000. The budget is as follows:
- $2,500 Book Covers- $100 New Website- $2,400 Initial Marketing
Whatever we raise will go toward these items.
