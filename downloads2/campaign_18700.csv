<h3>Hold These Truths</h3>

<p>     World War II has begun and a young student, Gordon Hirabayashi, agonizes over the US government's orders to forcibly remove and mass incarcerate all people of Japanese ancestry on the West Coast.

<p>     We are a 501(c)3, non-profit, New York City-based, theatre company creating works for the Off-Broadway stage.

And Jeanne Sakata's <i>Hold These Truths</i> is such a piece.  </p>
<p>In 1942, approximately 120,000 Japanese-Americans were targeted for internment by the United States government. One of these people, Gordon Hirabayashi, dared to take a stand and fight against his government's unjustified attack upon his civil rights. Now, in 2017, his story is more relevant than ever. Under our current U.S. government, constitutional rights are, again, in peril, and specific groups of people are being subjected to harsh scrutiny based solely upon their religion and ethnicity. We believe every American should  bear witness to Gordon Hirabayashi's incredible story: a journey of courage that can serve as a model to anyone wishing to raise their voice in protest to injustice.</p>

<p><strong>DESCRIPTION DU PROJET</strong></p>
<p>Avec la montée de la droite politique, l’espoir en l’humanité peut être ébranlée par des discours parfois haineux et empreints de lâcheté volontaire. Le besoin de reprendre ce texte de création est né du désir d’exposer quelques-uns de ces discours pour montrer l’absurdité des propos tenus par les personnages qui sont souvent contraires à la morale et aux normes sociales, mais qui, malheureusement, reflètent la pensée de plusieurs. L'ironie, bien ancrée dans l'écriture et qui sous-tend ce joyeux carnage, est manifeste.</p>
<p>À mesure que les tableaux se succèdent, le rationnel fait place à une animalité et une agressivité grandissantes pour finalement se terminer en une joyeuse chasse à l’homme effrénée, où parfois un groupe poursuit une personne, parfois une personne poursuit un groupe. Le discours disparaît pour laisser place au mouvement, aux pulsions. C’est tranchant comme un couteau bien effilé. Précis comme la pointe d’une flèche empoisonnée qui nous atteint en plein cœur. C'est la pièce <i>Tranche-cul </i>de Jean-Philippe Baril Guérard.</p>
<p><strong>Êtes-vous prêts</strong> <strong>?</strong> </p>
<p>C'est au second étage du Quartier de Lune à Limoilou que ça se passe. Du 6 au 16 novembre (relâche les vendredi 10 et samedi 11 novembre). <a href=""https://lepointdevente.com/billets/tranche-cul-ql"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://lepointdevente.com/billets/tranche-cul-ql</a></p>
<p>Pour que notre projet soit aussi éblouissant en réalité qu'il l'est dans nos têtes et dans nos cœurs depuis plusieurs semaines déjà, on a besoin de vous. De votre soutien. Qui est si précieux.  Que ce soit pour des éléments de décor évocateurs, des accessoires ou des costumes qui aideront à donner vie aux personnages, chaque contribution sera rentabilisée à son plein potentiel !</p>

<p><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></p>
<p>Il s’agit de nous. Il s’agit de vous. Il s’agit de ce que certains, vous et nous, peuvent penser tout bas de ces autres qui sont « différents » de soi. Certains le pensent sans le dire. D’autres le disent sans le penser.</p>
<p>Eux, ce sont 14 personnages qui montent aux barricades pour clamer haut et fort dans une succession de monologues adressés au public ce qu’ils pensent de cet ""autre"" à qui ils sont confrontés. Tel un miroir réfléchissant, voire même déformant, les personnages confrontent leur vision du monde et leur système de valeurs aux préjugés et autres idées préconçues des spectateurs. 9 comédiens (qui interprètent les 14 personnages) sont d’abord assis parmi les spectateurs et se fondent dans la foule : ce sont des gens comme nous, comme vous, assis tout autour et parmi nous ; ce sont nos amis, nos proches, vos personnes-ressources, vos voisins. Puis, se sentant interpellés par l’urgence de dire, les personnages se révèlent un à un et se commettent devant le public, règlent leurs comptes. Cruauté, capitalisme, misogynie, racisme, mondialisation, sont autant de thèmes abordés sans filtre où chacun tente d’assainir l’espèce humaine selon une vision bien personnelle en se basant sur un certain darwinisme social pour justifier sa prise de position. Des discours où la liberté d’opinion et d’expression se confondent à un droit à la persécution.</p>
<p><i>Publiée chez Dramaturges Éditeurs, la pièce a d’abord été créée dans le cadre d’un laboratoire présenté à la Zone Homa en 2013 par le Théâtre en petites coupures, puis a été reprise à L’Espace libre en décembre 2014. Les textes de ce jeune auteur au talent indéniable n’ont jamais été montés à Québec dans un contexte professionnel.</i>  </p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Shoko is a ballerina based in New York City. She grew up in the foothills along the base of Mount Fuji, in Japan. And she wants to share her passion for dance with as many people as she can. Shoko’s performing arts background, choreography, and professional dance experience are strongly interdisciplinary. Although her career has allowed her to perform on stages across the world dancing contemporary, modern, silk, &amp; jazz she often finds herself back where it all started, in pointe shoes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At age two, Shoko began dancing and training classical ballet in Japan. Since then dance has been her life’s work and passion. Dance is, and always has been her way of life.</p>
<div> </div>
<div>Over the next chapter of her professional career she wants to explore the blending of cultural idioms through movement and dance. Shoko has taken her years of classical ballet training along with her cultural heritage from Japan, and combined them into a new dance discipline; a decoupage of east meets west with a twist. Martial Arts and classical ballet; it’s The Matrix meets Swan Lake. This new form of dance challenges the audience to question what they were anticipating to see.</div>
<div>We call this project Ninja Ballet Dance Project, as it contains equal parts classical ballet and martial arts influences.</div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>The Plan</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise enough capital to rent a theatre, pay our performers, afford a marketing budget, and produce our first opening Ninja Ballet production.</p>
<p>Because we truly believe the more people who are able to experience our production, the more people will be able to identify with its message of unity &amp; the human experience.</p>

<h2>Lights Up!</h2>
<p>We are the brand new Do No Harm Theatre Company and we are preparing to present our first production in 2017.   Led by Co-Artistic Directors Cheryl Horne and Nomi Tichman, we believe in collaboration, in providing a safe space for the pursuit of art.  We believe that such a pursuit is accomplished when all involved are working toward a shared goal:  to tell a story, to illuminate a text, in short – to create art.  We strongly believe that a community of like-minded artists can change the world.  We aim to provide a safe haven for such activities.</p>
<p>These days seem to get darker and darker; let us gather together to create a well-lit space in which art and artists may flourish.</p>
<p>We are introducing Do No Harm with a new adaptation of <strong><i>A Child’s Christmas In Wales </i></strong>by Dylan Thomas at Pearl Studios on Sunday, December 10th for an invited audience.</p>
<p>In order to launch The Do No Harm Company's debut, we need to raise $1,600 to cover the rental of the hall and other related expenses for the presentation (stipends for actors, musical director and stage manager as well as rental of rehearsal space).</p>
</div><div>
<p>Any amount is welcome, but the first 5 contributors who pledge $100 or more will receive 2 reserved seats each to the presentation, along with a ""vintage"" copy of the poem, <i>A Child's Christmas in Wales</i>.</p>
<p>All contributors will receive Special Thanks program credit in any and all Do No Harm productions throughout 2018.</p>
<p>We believe that all artists deserve a safe environment in which to work, away from controversy and adverse criticism.  Art will flourish in this environment and will be sent out to enrich the world.</p>
<p>If you are unable to contribute to this project, please share this message with your friends.  Helping us get the word out is every bit as valuable as money.  Well, we like money too.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

debut/premiere season in 2016 (no set date yet). At this present time, 
ARIM Dance has a repertoire of 16 ballets which are in the process of 
being choreographed solely by Ari Mayzick, and a total of 15 dancers, 
including Ari himself. The company will present more than half of the 
works in 2 programs in its first NYC season.</p><p>ARIM

""Modern"" feel to it. The works/ballets range from dramatic to 
lighthearted, from abstract to life's situations and more, while

</h3><h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Mission Fusion is an acclaimed after-school dance program based
at Jefferson High School in Daly City, California. For four months each year, some
150 middle- and high-school students participate in dance, percussion, and
acting workshops led by guest teachers and choreographers. Their efforts
culminate in public performances attended by upwards of 1,500 students,
parents, and community members. The Mission Fusion program is operated by the
Jefferson Union High School District, with partial support from Children’s
Empowerment, Inc.</p>
<h3>Project Need</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>Jefferson High School
(JHS) in Daly City is rated only 3 (out of 10) on California’s Academic
Performance Index (API). The student body is 98% minority (primarily Hispanic
and Filipino), and 62% economically disadvantaged. Yet with the help of CEI’s
academic programs, the school’s scores on state tests have improved
significantly: JHS is now one of the top schools in San Mateo County for
qualifying Latino students for university admission, as measured by the
percentage of Latino students with four-year graduation and eligibility for
admission to the University of California or California State University.</p>
<p>The younger members of Mission Fusion come from Pollicita
Middle School, also in Daly City. Its demographics are similar to those of JHS,
and the school itself is rated as a Performance Improvement (PI) 5 school, the
federal designation for schools with five years of unacceptable progress. In
this environment, the Mission Fusion dance program offers students from both
schools valuable opportunities for educational enrichment and achievement.</p>
<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>Mission Fusion is a gathering of arts and cultures designed
to build bridges in the community. Each year’s production has some 25 segments
featuring the dances, rhythms, songs, oral histories, and traditions of the cultures
represented along Mission Street in Daly City. The main shows at the Jefferson
High School Theater have sold out for the last 10 years. The group has also
performed at Skyline College in San Bruno, City College of San Francisco, and neighboring
high schools and middle schools. The tentative dates for the next show are
February 4, 5, and 6, 2016.</p>
<p>Founded in 2000, Mission Fusion is a quality program in an
underperforming school, yielding many benefits for its participants. For
students from poor families who are interested in the performing arts, Mission
Fusion offers the only local option for practicing dance. Students pay nothing
to participate; even their costumes are provided free. Mission Fusion offers a
positive school experience for underperforming students who may be struggling
with their academic subjects because they are visual, aural, or experiential
learners. It also builds character as students learn self-discipline, perseverance,
time management, and collaboration skills. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>Mission Fusion also develops
students’ social skills, bridging gaps among young people of different ages,
races, and ethnicities. Students break out of their ethnic communities to form
friendships with those from other communities and to learn about their
traditions and values. This benefit extends to their families. More than half
of Daly City’s population was born outside the U.S., and parents working long
hours to support their families and speaking limited or no English have few
opportunities to learn about the cultures and traditions of their neighbors.
Their children’s involvement with Mission Fusion opens a new world for these
new U.S. residents.</p>

1868 by local schoolteacher Sarah Bradford, was written specifically for actress-singer Christine Dixon by playwright Morna Murphy, with original
songs by Ralph Martell, through a grant from the Staten Island Arts Council in
2008. <br/><br/>In this unique show, Christine, as Harriet, draws the
audience right into the action with her. She brings children on stage and “<i>leads</i>” them to freedom; she gets a man
and a woman to be her father and mother, then boldly “<i>rescues</i>” them from slavery. In a funny scene, after Harriet escapes
to freedom, she returns to the South months later and “<i>scolds</i>” her husband, John Tubman (“<i>played</i>” by an audience member) who has married another woman while
she was away.<br/><br/><p>Many people, after seeing this show, say that Christine made
them feel they were actually meeting Harriet Tubman herself. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442631326/cyaelpdg0bgflox3519v.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3>Christine has been performing this show and the production costs for each show range from $350 (at community centers) to $800
(at universities). However, there are many youth centers, schools or churches,
located in lower-income areas, that have <u>no</u> budgets to pay for
theatrical productions. These are the very places where young people –
especially African-American young people – need to be inspired by Harriet
Tubman’s story.<div>
<p>
</p>
<p>We are asking for $7,000 to enable us to donate 10 performances at 10 of these significant venues. The money is needed for expenses that include performance
fees to Christine, expenses for traveling, costumes &amp; props, dry cleaning,
meetings with venue managers, publicity, printing, flyers, mailings, perks,
etc.</p>

<u><br/><h3><u><u>Why 'HARRIET TUBMAN HERSELF' is Important</u></u></h3></u>
</div><div>Today, in the news, movies, TV, magazines and the internet,
African-Americans are too often presented in a very negative light. Many are
admired in sports and entertainment, but there is a long line of courageous
forerunners that African-American youth should know about. Harriet Tubman is
one of them and a wonderful role model. She was a young woman who, in spite of
terrible circumstances, accomplished so much that helped better the lives of so
many people. She herself said: <i>""I never considered myself a
downtrodden slave!""<br/><br/></i>
<p>In HARRIET TUBMAN HERSELF young people of color meet a
down-to-earth Harriet who shows that with a true feeling of self-esteem, and self-worth,
they can also have the confidence to better their own lives and help make the
world around them a better place.</p>

1868 by local schoolteacher Sarah Bradford, was written specifically for actress-singer Christine Dixon by playwright Morna Murphy, with original
songs by Ralph Martell, through a grant from the Staten Island Arts Council in
2008. In this unique show, Christine, as Harriet, draws the
audience right into the action with her. She brings children on stage and “leads” them to freedom; she gets a man
and a woman to be her father and mother, then boldly “rescues” them from slavery. In a funny scene, after Harriet escapes
to freedom, she returns to the South months later and “scolds” her husband, John Tubman (“played” by an audience member) who has married another woman while
she was away.Many people, after seeing this show, say that Christine made
them feel they were actually meeting Harriet Tubman herself. What We Need
Christine has been performing this show and the production costs for each show range from $350 (at community centers) to $800
(at universities). However, there are many youth centers, schools or churches,
located in lower-income areas, that have no budgets to pay for
theatrical productions. These are the very places where young people –
especially African-American young people – need to be inspired by Harriet
Tubman’s story.


We are asking for $7,000 to enable us to donate 10 performances at 10 of these significant venues. The money is needed for expenses that include performance
fees to Christine, expenses for traveling, costumes & props, dry cleaning,
meetings with venue managers, publicity, printing, flyers, mailings, perks,
etc.

Why 'HARRIET TUBMAN HERSELF' is Important
Today, in the news, movies, TV, magazines and the internet,
African-Americans are too often presented in a very negative light. Many are
admired in sports and entertainment, but there is a long line of courageous
forerunners that African-American youth should know about. Harriet Tubman is
one of them and a wonderful role model. She was a young woman who, in spite of
terrible circumstances, accomplished so much that helped better the lives of so
many people. She herself said: ""I never considered myself a
downtrodden slave!""
In HARRIET TUBMAN HERSELF young people of color meet a
down-to-earth Harriet who shows that with a true feeling of self-esteem, and self-worth,
they can also have the confidence to better their own lives and help make the
world around them a better place.

<span>LOVE, LOCS &amp; LIBERATION<br/></span>
</h1>
<h3>A Solo Play Written and Performed by Ella Turenne<br/>Produced by Africa Miranda</h3>
<blockquote><i>“To be beautiful does not refer alone to the arrangements of the hair, the perfection of the complexion or to the beauty of form....to be beautiful, one must combine these qualities with a beautiful mind and soul.” - Madam CJ Walker</i></blockquote>
<h3>What is Love, Locs &amp; Liberation?</h3>
<p>Using my own journey through storytelling, poetry and song, this solo show will unlock Black women’s hair history, rituals, struggles and triumphs. I play over 10 characters, from Madame CJ Walker to a 5th grade bully to a West Indian hair stylist - all to expose how hair is tied to politics, identity and culture and illustrate why hair is an intimate and essential part of Black life. I ask the question: Is my worth inevitably tied to my hair? This roller coaster ride will have you laughing and crying but most importantly, having a conversation about our identity as women and how we own it. We’re looking to bring this show to LA and NY late this summer.</p>

<h3><span>Who am I?</span></h3>I’m an actor, writer, poet and producer who has been doing this work for close to two decades. The arts is my passion and I’m bringing it to the stage big time with this show! Some of my acting credits include plays such as <b>Love Child</b> at the Harlem Theatre Company, <b>Working Things Out</b> which premiered at the Downtown Urban Theatre Festival, the short film <b>Big, Dark, Scary Girl </b>and the newly completed feature film <b>Forever Yours</b>. I’ve performed my poetry all over the country including the Black Family Channel show <b>Spoken</b> which was hosted by Jessica Care Moore.

</div><h3><span>Why Love, Locs &amp; Liberation?</span></h3><p>In college I wrote a poem called Wooly Metal Hair, my ode to Black hair, it’s trials, tribulations...and celebrations! It was published in 2008. Then in 2009 I was chosen to be part of a HBO’s documentary, The Black List. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F101066661&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F101066661&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F482753482_295x166.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>It was the first time I spoke publicly about my hair journey and how it had affected me. Until then, I hadn’t really put all the pieces together, but being on the Black List helped me realized that I had a story to tell.

This is a conversation I hope to take worldwide!</p><h3>My Track Record</h3><p>Although this is my first solo show, I have produced theatre and film before. My play <b>Gray</b> premiered in the Harlem Heritage Fringe Festival in 2009. I also co-wrote and co-starred in the critically acclaimed webisode series <b>Kindred</b>, which garnered much media attention and was an official selection of the LA Web Fest. My first short film, <b>woodshed</b>, which I directed and produced, had its world premiere at the Hollywood Film Festival. <b>woodshed</b> was also nominated for Best Short in the Montreal International Black Film Festival. I also co-wrote and co-starred in the critically acclaimed webisode series <b>Kindred</b>, which garnered much media attention and was an official selection of the LA Web Fest.

A Solo Play Written and Performed by Ella TurenneProduced by Africa Miranda
“To be beautiful does not refer alone to the arrangements of the hair, the perfection of the complexion or to the beauty of form....to be beautiful, one must combine these qualities with a beautiful mind and soul.” - Madam CJ Walker
What is Love, Locs & Liberation?
Using my own journey through storytelling, poetry and song, this solo show will unlock Black women’s hair history, rituals, struggles and triumphs. I play over 10 characters, from Madame CJ Walker to a 5th grade bully to a West Indian hair stylist - all to expose how hair is tied to politics, identity and culture and illustrate why hair is an intimate and essential part of Black life. I ask the question: Is my worth inevitably tied to my hair? This roller coaster ride will have you laughing and crying but most importantly, having a conversation about our identity as women and how we own it. We’re looking to bring this show to LA and NY late this summer.



Who am I?I’m an actor, writer, poet and producer who has been doing this work for close to two decades. The arts is my passion and I’m bringing it to the stage big time with this show! Some of my acting credits include plays such as Love Child at the Harlem Theatre Company, Working Things Out which premiered at the Downtown Urban Theatre Festival, the short film Big, Dark, Scary Girl and the newly completed feature film Forever Yours. I’ve performed my poetry all over the country including the Black Family Channel show Spoken which was hosted by Jessica Care Moore. Visit my website at www.ellaturenne.com!   
Why Love, Locs & Liberation?In college I wrote a poem called Wooly Metal Hair, my ode to Black hair, it’s trials, tribulations...and celebrations! It was published in 2008. Then in 2009 I was chosen to be part of a HBO’s documentary, The Black List. It was the first time I spoke publicly about my hair journey and how it had affected me. Until then, I hadn’t really put all the pieces together, but being on the Black List helped me realized that I had a story to tell. I started talking to other Black women about it and realized it was a story that needed to be shared. This is not just a play. This is a conversation I hope to take worldwide!My Track RecordAlthough this is my first solo show, I have produced theatre and film before. My play Gray premiered in the Harlem Heritage Fringe Festival in 2009. I also co-wrote and co-starred in the critically acclaimed webisode series Kindred, which garnered much media attention and was an official selection of the LA Web Fest. My first short film, woodshed, which I directed and produced, had its world premiere at the Hollywood Film Festival. woodshed was also nominated for Best Short in the Montreal International Black Film Festival. I also co-wrote and co-starred in the critically acclaimed webisode series Kindred, which garnered much media attention and was an official selection of the LA Web Fest. Most recently my short film Freedom premiered at the Black Starr Film Fest in Philadelphia and the Haiti Film Fest in NY.What We Need & What You GetA portion of the budget for this project is $10,000.

Hi folks. It's Myles Breen. If you're a friend of ours thanks for coming, if you're a stranger step on in gorgeous!As you might know our show LANGUAGE UNBECOMING A LADY has been invited to the prestigious Origin’s 1st Irish Theatre Festival in Manhattan this September. As Limerick's first and only production at the festival in its seven years, we join a host of international productions in New York City for a two week run at the Cell Theatre, and get to represent you, our city, and our country in the Big Apple.
This is not only this play's international premiere, but the first Bottom Dog Theatre production to be staged outside Ireland! We are incredibly excited at the prospect, and so launch our first crowd funding campaign to make it a reality.This is your opportunity to be part of our team, part of the journey - to see your very own theatre company represent you on the American stage. Like Munster's 16th man, we need you to be our Top Dog! If you can, we promise to do you proud.

The PlayI wrote and performed this play for the first time in 2009 as part of Limerick's annual Pride festival. Directed by my friend and colleague Liam O'Brien (or as many of you know Liam - the Bert to my Ernie*) our small show played for just four nights at the offsite Belltable Space in the city.* we still maintain separate beds no matter what the internet says :)Completely sold out and consecutive standing ovations later, we were overwhelmed by the response from local audiences. And so began a love affair with 'The Divine Diana' that has taken our show across the country to 19 venues, with over 55 performances to audiences of over 5000 people. We've toured from Cork to Donegal, Galway to Dublin and everywhere in between garnering wonderful reviews such as:





""Unadorned, vulnerable and comically self-
critical, Breen is a shining and believable
presence"" - IRISH TIMES 









""Fabulously written, wonderfully acted, tells an
extremely important story, and is an undoubted
success"" - IRISH THEATRE MAGAZINE 









""Breen's writing is sharp, colourful,
aphoristic...it's emotional honesty is compelling""
- IRISH EXAMINER 









It has always been a dream of ours to tour this work abroad, and in the light of the historic YES vote for Marriage Equality, it seems like the right time to celebrate where we now are, but also remember where we came from.
To tell my story and the story of countless Irish gay men and women, through the medium of theatre I love so much at Origin's 1st Irish Theatre Festival, is the opportunity we've been waiting for. In over 30 years in the business I've never performed my own writing outside Ireland - and now's my chance!
To make this a reality, and get our small creative team of Liam, Pius McGrath and myself to Manhattan, we now need your support - but we don't expect if for nathin!

Written & performed by Richard Byford
Produced by Richard Byford
Production Consultant Lindsay Wagner

Richard Byford has had a dream for many years of writing, producing and performing in his own one man theatrical presentation. He has distilled his many adventures across Europe and America, his battle with cancer, and the motley crew of characters he has encountered over the years into a solo performance like no other. Performances of his many original songs including his Grammy Contender for Song of the Year “Touched by the hands of an Angel” are a highlight of this heartfelt and very personal look at a life well-lived.
For recent reviews please go to the web site:
http://theheartofagypsytroubadour.com

However, the costs of taking the show across country (yes, I am
driving from CA to NYC) and hopefully stopping in towns along the
way to perform the show, are mind blowing -

Here are just a few of the costs involved:
The festival participation fee
The insurance for the show
Gas, hotels & food across country
Rental of small theatres along the way
Hotel & parking in NYC
Cost of props and costuming
Stage management & production crew
video production and packaging
marketing and publicity
cost of ads
And, of course, I have to get back home!
I can’t continue to produce The Heart of a Gypsy Troubadour
without your help!

<p>It is generally accepted that there is another side to every story. Generally accepted, but seldom explored. Formed in December 2014, Dangerous To Know is a  new and ambitious Manchester-based theatre company that brings modern history to the stage, lending the past a powerful contemporary voice. Firmly based in truth, our works dissect long-accepted facts and explore myth and scandal through the sharp lens of modern values. </p>
<p>The company began work on their inaugural production, The Dissolution of Percy, last year. The play tells the story of Branwell, the controversial brother of Charlotte, Emily and Anne Brontë. It reveals the cruel gender politics that destroyed a man, made a villain of his lover and chained his sisters to a life they despised.  A first sharing in January 2015 proved extremely successful.</p>
<p>The production will primarily be staged at the Kings Arms Theatre in Salford from 4th - 7th November 2015, and then for a night at the Parkside Social Club in Haworth on 14th November 2015. For this to be successful, and for the company to flourish from thereon, it all depends on you. If you decide to donate, Dangerous To Know will be able to purchase the equipment and set pieces that will allow The Dissolution of Percy to have continuing life, and potentially to travel to venues around the UK. We will also be able to provide a basic rate of pay for our very hard-working team members. Without your help, this will not be possible.</p>
<p>We believe there is a great deal to learn from the past. We believe our company can create affecting work that studies the human condition and delves into history to reveal powerful lessons and astonishing inspiration. Please support our first major project and allow us to take the first step in establishing Dangerous To Know as a major player in regional theatre.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are asking for £8,000 worth of donations overall. Just over £5,000 of this will go towards the payment of seven team members for a month of rehearsals as well as one week and one day of performances. The rest will serve as a budget to purchase and hire set, costumes and equipment, to create promotional material and to transport everything between venues.</p>

<p>Shock Therapy Productions is a Gold Coast based production company founded in January 2015 by actors/producers and directors Sam Foster and Hayden Jones. </p>
<p>Already in this first year we have produced <i>The Apology </i>as part of the Anywhere Theatre Festival, <i>The Forwards</i> as part of the Independent Theatre Season at the Arts Centre Gold Coast and now this new, reworked, remounted version of <i>The Pillowman </i>at the Brisbane Powerhouse<i>. </i></p>
<p>The company previously presented a sold out season of <i>The Pillowman</i> at the Arts Centre Gold Coast in 2014 and we are super excited to be bringing a new and updated version of the show to Brisbane now. </p>
<p><i>The Pillowman</i> is the story of Katurian, a writer who is questioned by police over the content of some short stories which bear an uncanny similarity to real life murders of children.  Set in a police interrogation room in a totalitarian state, it explores themes of oppression, control, censorship and the role of trauma in shaping human behaviour. </p>
<p>A fusion of puppetry, physical theatre, shadow play and intense, razor-sharp dialogue, Shock Therapy Productions' dynamic interpretation of acclaimed Irish playwright Martin McDonagh's black comedy <i>The Pillowman</i> will have audiences at the Brisbane Powerhouse laughing inappropriately in August.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436871878/zlyxrmddwjm6sdtq1cnq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are very pleased to have the Brisbane Powerhouse hosting us in the Vizy theatre for this season and there in-kind support and assistance is greatly appreciated.  However, their contribution does not cover the entire costs associated with remounting this epic production.  </p>
<p>This remount has 2 new cast members as well as a new lighting designer and AV designer.  This means we will need to fund a re-rehearsal period to add all the new aspects to the show.  Having already presented a version of the show last year at the Arts Centre Gold Coast, we are excited to have the opportunity to enhance the production further and include a number of new elements this time round.</p>
<p>We applied to the Australia Council for the Arts for funding for this project but unfortunately we were unsuccessful with our application.  Arts funding (particularly national funding) has become increasingly difficult to come by as a result is incredibly competitive. </p>
<p>As a result of missing out on this funding we now turn to you, our supporters to assist us in putting this powerful, hilarious, challenging, entertaining and thought-provoking production on the stage.  </p>
<p>If you are a supporter of live theatre or of the arts in general, and you are in a position to lend a hand to a newly formed, independent company then here is a perfect opportunity to help out and feel awesome about yourself in the process! </p>
<p>We have set a goal of <b>$5000</b> and the funds raised will go towards the following:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Play rights </li>
<li>Creative team (including lighting and AV designers, puppeteer, stage manager, actors, director)</li>
<li>Rehearsal space </li>
</ul>
<div>The total cost of this remount production is well over <b>$20,000</b> so these funds are a small but vitally important contribution to the overall success of this show, especially now that we are without substantial funding and as of this week a rehearsal space! </div>
<div>Additional funds raised will help go towards marketing and publicity costs and also set and costume. </div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436873685/z6xnrddg8ololov7zuvd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your contribution to this project will ensure that live, locally produced theatre is thriving and sustainable for local artists.  Without an audience we have no job, and without funds we cannot create exciting, relevant and important art for the community to engage with. </p>
<p>As artists we aspire to create dynamic, entertaining and thought-provoking work for the general public.  As a contributor to this project you are an integral part of making this possible. </p>
<p>Live theatre is a wonderful and important part of our social fabric.  We are story tellers and as human beings we have been telling stories (whether through drama, dance or song) since we began to communicate.  These stories shape who we are as individuals and as a community and help us to define what it is to be human.  We love telling stories but it's hard work!  </p>
<p>Artists are passionate and often work for little or no money.  This is the stark reality of the Arts in this country.  We are doing our best to change this situation and your assistance plays a huge part in making this goal possible.  </p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>

Already in this first year we have produced The Apology as part of the Anywhere Theatre Festival, The Forwards as part of the Independent Theatre Season at the Arts Centre Gold Coast and now this new, reworked, remounted version of The Pillowman at the Brisbane Powerhouse. 
The company previously presented a sold out season of The Pillowman at the Arts Centre Gold Coast in 2014 and we are super excited to be bringing a new and updated version of the show to Brisbane now. 
The Pillowman is the story of Katurian, a writer who is questioned by police over the content of some short stories which bear an uncanny similarity to real life murders of children.  Set in a police interrogation room in a totalitarian state, it explores themes of oppression, control, censorship and the role of trauma in shaping human behaviour. 
A fusion of puppetry, physical theatre, shadow play and intense, razor-sharp dialogue, Shock Therapy Productions' dynamic interpretation of acclaimed Irish playwright Martin McDonagh's black comedy The Pillowman will have audiences at the Brisbane Powerhouse laughing inappropriately in August.




What We Need & What You Get We are very pleased to have the Brisbane Powerhouse hosting us in the Vizy theatre for this season and there in-kind support and assistance is greatly appreciated.  However, their contribution does not cover the entire costs associated with remounting this epic production.  
This remount has 2 new cast members as well as a new lighting designer and AV designer.  This means we will need to fund a re-rehearsal period to add all the new aspects to the show.  Having already presented a version of the show last year at the Arts Centre Gold Coast, we are excited to have the opportunity to enhance the production further and include a number of new elements this time round.
We applied to the Australia Council for the Arts for funding for this project but unfortunately we were unsuccessful with our application.  Arts funding (particularly national funding) has become increasingly difficult to come by as a result is incredibly competitive. 
As a result of missing out on this funding we now turn to you, our supporters to assist us in putting this powerful, hilarious, challenging, entertaining and thought-provoking production on the stage.  
If you are a supporter of live theatre or of the arts in general, and you are in a position to lend a hand to a newly formed, independent company then here is a perfect opportunity to help out and feel awesome about yourself in the process! 
We have set a goal of $5000 and the funds raised will go towards the following:


Play rights 
Creative team (including lighting and AV designers, puppeteer, stage manager, actors, director)
Rehearsal space 

The total cost of this remount production is well over $20,000 so these funds are a small but vitally important contribution to the overall success of this show, especially now that we are without substantial funding and as of this week a rehearsal space! 
Additional funds raised will help go towards marketing and publicity costs and also set and costume. 




    The Impact Your contribution to this project will ensure that live, locally produced theatre is thriving and sustainable for local artists.  Without an audience we have no job, and without funds we cannot create exciting, relevant and important art for the community to engage with. 
As artists we aspire to create dynamic, entertaining and thought-provoking work for the general public.  As a contributor to this project you are an integral part of making this possible. 
Live theatre is a wonderful and important part of our social fabric.  We are story tellers and as human beings we have been telling stories (whether through drama, dance or song) since we began to communicate.  These stories shape who we are as individuals and as a community and help us to define what it is to be human.  We love telling stories but it's hard work!  
Artists are passionate and often work for little or no money.  This is the stark reality of the Arts in this country.  We are doing our best to change this situation and your assistance plays a huge part in making this goal possible.  

    
Other Ways You Can Help If you are not able to offer any financial assistance to this project then never fear, there are some other ways you can help us make this project a huge success.

We want to open up an online store where you can rent leotards for a day (or more) for a fraction of the cost.</p><p>But we need YOUR help to make this idea a reality. Help us and pledge a few dollars!</p><h1><b>How It Works</b></h1><p><b>Basics and Pricing</b></p><p>Leotard Obsession will be fully online at <a href=""http://leotardobsessed.com./"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">leotardobsession.com.</a> When it opens (hopefully in July 2015), you will be able to browse all the styles of leotards. You'll be able to sort by size, color, brand, style, and price. The leotards will be priced between $3-15 per day, depending on the retail price. If you rent it for more than one day, the price would be the one day price plus half that for each additional day. For instance, if you rented an Eleve leotard that was $6.67/day, and you wanted to rent it for 3 days, it would be $6.67+$3.33 for each additional day, for a total of $13.34.</p><p><b>Shipping</b></p><p>Shipping is not available internationally right now (sorry!) but if you are in the US we will make sure it gets to you exactly when you need it (most likely the afternoon/day before). You will have to order a certain number of days in advance - we expect around 3-4 days - so it'll get to you on time, otherwise you'll have to pay extra for shipping. We will be using USPS. If you buy a reward that doesn't include shipping costs, it will most likely be $5-10 round-trip (depends on where you live).</p><p>Return shipping: since you are just renting the leotard, you will have to ship it back to us. We will enclose a paid shipping sticker that you can stick on your return package. At checkout, there will be an option to have us enclose packaging for the return, or you can just reuse the original packaging.</p><p><b>Hygiene</b></p><p>You might be thinking, ""That sounds gross! I have to share leotards with who knows how many other people!"" At Leotard Obsession, we will be in charge of washing the leotards, ensuring each and every leotard is kept at a high level of cleanliness. No leotard will go to you unwashed, smelly, or even remotely unclean. This is a high priority for us. That being said, we are not responsible for any skin rashes you develop if you are allergic to a particular soap or material.</p><p>Also, as an extra precaution, we include a new, unused pantyliner in each leotard. They are there for your protection as an added security.</p><p>Related to that, you also will never receive a damaged leotard. They will all be perfect. If a leotard is ripped or gets a hole, we will either sew it back up to our satisfaction, or we will put it on clearance, where you can buy it for a low price. Never fear that you will get a low-quality leotard!</p><p><b>Time-frame</b></p><p>We hope to be open by November 2015. If all goes according to plan, the online store at <a href=""http://leotardobsessed.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">leotardobsessed.com</a> will open then.

If you're doing a photoshoot and want a loud, colorful leotard, why not rent it? You probably wouldn't wear it in class, anyways. How about that beautiful Yumiko you see at the dance store, but can't buy? Yumikos are an investment, and you can save yourself money by renting.

</h3>Live Action Novelty Combat Entertainment or LANCE is a fledgling group looking to become a full-blown Non-Profit Performance Organization. Our goal is to make live combat entertainment available 
to a broad audience in Central Florida. Founded in 2015, we offer 
training in stage combat as well as customized performances for 
parties, festivals, and special events.<br/><br/>If you would like to see us perform live, be sure to come to the Cloak &amp; Blaster in Orlando on November 18th! Here is a link to the Facebook event page: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/914774028607678/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/events/914774028607678/</a><br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3> <p>In order to take the step from group to organization, we need your help. Priority one for the funds we raise will be to apply for our 501(c)3(non-profit) status with the IRS. Next, we will create budgets for essential items such as training equipment (safety mats, weapons, practice spaces, etc), marketing necessaries (flyers, signs, etc), and performance insurance.<br/></p> <ul> </ul>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
We have a variety of perks to thank you for your donation to our campaign! In addition to various physical perks, a donation at any level will come with a digital banner denoting your membership in one of the LANCE Orlando Orders. Each level also includes a personal thank you on our Facebook page.<br/> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact <br/>
</h3>We look forward to bringing high quality live combat entertainment to people who might not otherwise be able to see it due to high ticket costs at other existing venues. Experiencing stage combat live can also inspire people to pursue it, as well as stunt performing, as a hobby or career. Our classes and workshops will offer an opportunity for people to explore options they never knew they had!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges<br/>
</h3> <p> The path ahead of us is a difficult one, we know. There are already a multitude of entertainment options here in Orlando.<span> We want to expand to birthdays, corporate events, conventions, special events, other faires and festivals. It is going to be an up-hill battle to get our name out there. We want people in Central Florida to know us as an unique and exciting entertainment option for their events!</span></p>
<p><span>With the help of our supporters, we will spread the word about our organization to the Central Florida area.!</span></p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you just can't contribute, we understand, but that doesn't mean you can't help in other ways!</p> <ul> <li>Make some noise about our campaign! Share it on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Google+, and any other social group you are part of!</li> <li>Indiegogo has some great share tools so be sure to check those out!</li>
<li>Come check out LANCE for yourself! We're always open to newcomers, and there's no experience necessary to start learning in stage combat with the help of our excellent trainers!</li>

parties, festivals, and special events.If you would like to see us perform live, be sure to come to the Cloak & Blaster in Orlando on November 18th! Here is a link to the Facebook event page: https://www.facebook.com/events/914774028607678/   What We Need
 In order to take the step from group to organization, we need your help. Priority one for the funds we raise will be to apply for our 501(c)3(non-profit) status with the IRS. Next, we will create budgets for essential items such as training equipment (safety mats, weapons, practice spaces, etc), marketing necessaries (flyers, signs, etc), and performance insurance.  
What You Get
We have a variety of perks to thank you for your donation to our campaign! In addition to various physical perks, a donation at any level will come with a digital banner denoting your membership in one of the LANCE Orlando Orders. Each level also includes a personal thank you on our Facebook page.   The Impact 
We look forward to bringing high quality live combat entertainment to people who might not otherwise be able to see it due to high ticket costs at other existing venues. Experiencing stage combat live can also inspire people to pursue it, as well as stunt performing, as a hobby or career. Our classes and workshops will offer an opportunity for people to explore options they never knew they had!
  Risks & Challenges
  The path ahead of us is a difficult one, we know. There are already a multitude of entertainment options here in Orlando. We want to expand to birthdays, corporate events, conventions, special events, other faires and festivals. It is going to be an up-hill battle to get our name out there. We want people in Central Florida to know us as an unique and exciting entertainment option for their events!
With the help of our supporters, we will spread the word about our organization to the Central Florida area.!   Other Ways You Can Help If you just can't contribute, we understand, but that doesn't mean you can't help in other ways!  Make some noise about our campaign! Share it on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Google+, and any other social group you are part of! Indiegogo has some great share tools so be sure to check those out!
Come check out LANCE for yourself! We're always open to newcomers, and there's no experience necessary to start learning in stage combat with the help of our excellent trainers!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Khaos Company Theatre is a professional non-union theatre in Indianapolis that strives to bridge the gap between community and equity theatre, paying actors by profit share and providing a place to grow and flourish.</p>
<p>As many of you know, Indy’s Khaos Company Theatre has recently relocated to a beautiful, large space with three stages. While this is wonderful for us and those who choose to work with us, it comes with a new set of expenses. Kaylee Spivey Good, whom you may know as the theatre’s current Artistic Director and her husband, are only a few months away from moving abroad to pursue their postgraduate studies, so KCT is going through a large period of transition. While we have worked (and will continue working) with local groups and artists, it’s not enough to keep us going. That’s where you come in!</p>
<p>We are raising $30,000 by midnight on July 22nd to keep Khaos extensively active in the theatre community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $30,000 by midnight on July 22nd and you can help! These funds will be used to cover expansion costs, including rent, maintenance, set-design, costumes and general up-keep of the theatre for the next year. We're hoping to use these funds to cover expenses that would otherwise cut into the profit share that is shared amount artists. As our goal is to provide paying opportunities for artists, so raising these funds ensures that KCT can continue to provide paid opportunities for actors, directors, playwrights, and artists!</p>
<h3>What We Do For Our Community</h3>
<p>Since Khaos Company Theatre's opening in 2014, KCT has been devoted to providing working opportunities for emerging artists in the Indianapolis area. Indy has a wonderfully diverse theatre market, however, it can be challenging for emerging non-union artists to find paid work and opportunities. This often leads to a theatrical brain-drain, where artists move to other cities to continue their careers! KCT is dedicated to hiring emerging artists and strives to keep our talent in Indiana!</p>
<p>This means, emerging artists guide KCT's goals. Khaos Company Theatre does not limit its production season to any one type of genre, rather it lets emerging artists guide the season. By allowing the theatre to produce all kinds of productions, new, old, dramas, comedies and musicals, we ensure that all artists can benefit from performances at KCT. </p>
<p>New directors, actors and playwrights have all had their talents on our our stages! KCT even holds youth courses to encourage Indy's young performers to pursue a career in the arts! </p>
<p>KCT provides a safe space for everyone who comes through our doors. We encourage everyone to express themselves in a safe, healthy, and beautiful expression of humanity!</p>
<p>And we need your help!</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>We need YOU to ensure that we continue to exist to create quality professional theatre in Indianapolis!</p>
<p>Of course, we will accept any donation, but we have some incentives for those who donate more! Some prizes include KCT T-Shirts, KCT Mugs, Tickets to KCT""s production of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing, KCT 2017 Season Passes, A Cast-Talk Back after the performance of Much Ado About Nothing and our pièce de résistance.....a masquerade festival!</p>
<p>We are holding a summer masquerade festival in the spirit of our upcoming production of Much Ado About Nothing. The festivities will include (but are certainly not limited to):</p>
<p>• Local artist booths • Local musicians • Local food trucks • Masquerade mask contest (bring your own!) • Face painting • Silent auction • more to come…</p>
<p>But to get tickets, you gotta get in on the action by contributing to our Indiegogo campaign!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We're a very small local business that has only been in existence since 2014. In fact, KCT's original start-up money was raised through an Indiegogo campaign! Well, we're reaching for the stars again, and hoping that you can help us! </p>
<p>We want to continue to provide opportunities to emerging artists, keep our performing arts talent in Indiana, and provide a safe space for self-expression for everyone. PLEASE consider contributing to our campaign so that we can continue to provide quality art to audiences, you and emerging artists. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We realize that $30,000 is an ambitious goal! Even if we fall short of the total we hope to raise, we'll still get the proceeds that are donated through Indiegogo so you don't have to worry that your contribution won't reach us! The expansion costs that we are looking to cover are paid month by month so even if we don't reach our projected goal, the donations will still be used to cover the month to month costs. </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What is GYNX?</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>GYNX (pronounced ""jinx"") is a full-length play written by award-winning writer Alicen Grey, set to premiere at Thespis Theatre Festival in August 2017! </strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">MONDAY August 21st, 6:15pm<br/>FRIDAY August 25th, 9:00pm<br/>SUNDAY August 27th, 3:30pm</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">@ <u>Hudson Guild Theatre in NYC</u></p>
<p>Here's the plot:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">A homeless teen lesbian, a prostituted girl, an underground abortionist, and a former child porn victim are recruited into a rapist castration plot by a mysterious woman named Gynx. Men go into hiding, women take over the streets, and their operation makes global headlines.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">But when Gynx’s true motives are revealed, the group is forced to question whether they are truly on the side of justice.</p>

<li>GYNX passes <i>every </i><a href=""http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Media_test"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>feminist media test</u></a> out there</li>
<li>GYNX raises awareness about feminist issues such as LGBT homelessness, human trafficking, child pornography, reproductive autonomy... and, of course, rape culture</li>
<li>GYNX is written, directed <i>and </i>performed by women. (Considering the fact that theater has a history of excluding women from productions, this is <i>kind of a big deal.)</i>
</li>
<li>It's about castrating rapists. (Come on, who <i>doesn't</i> want to see that?)</li>
<li><strong>It's entertaining as f*ck</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This is your chance to support a female playwright, her woman-powered production team, feminist theater, and independent art, all in one shot.</strong></p>

<p>If you've never been involved in a theatrical production, you may not understand why we're asking for thousands of dollars. So to give you an idea, here's just a <i>light sampling</i> of the resources we need to put this show together:</p>

<li>director fee</li>
<li>actors (of course)</li>
<li>a lighting designer</li>
<li>a sound designer</li>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>""How can I help?""</strong></h2>
<p>Glad you asked!</p>
<p>Theatrical productions are incredibly resource-intensive, and <i>every little bit counts</i>. So whether you can donate $1, $100 or $1,000, we'll be profoundly grateful either way! </p>

What is GYNX?
GYNX (pronounced ""jinx"") is a full-length play written by award-winning writer Alicen Grey, set to premiere at Thespis Theatre Festival in August 2017! 
Show dates:
MONDAY August 21st, 6:15pmFRIDAY August 25th, 9:00pmSUNDAY August 27th, 3:30pm
@ Hudson Guild Theatre in NYC
Here's the plot:
A homeless teen lesbian, a prostituted girl, an underground abortionist, and a former child porn victim are recruited into a rapist castration plot by a mysterious woman named Gynx. Men go into hiding, women take over the streets, and their operation makes global headlines.
But when Gynx’s true motives are revealed, the group is forced to question whether they are truly on the side of justice.
---
For all the info, visit www.gynxtheplay.com
 

Here's why you'll love it:

GYNX passes every feminist media test out there
GYNX raises awareness about feminist issues such as LGBT homelessness, human trafficking, child pornography, reproductive autonomy... and, of course, rape culture
GYNX is written, directed and performed by women. (Considering the fact that theater has a history of excluding women from productions, this is kind of a big deal.)

It's about castrating rapists. (Come on, who doesn't want to see that?)
It's entertaining as f*ck

This is your chance to support a female playwright, her woman-powered production team, feminist theater, and independent art, all in one shot.
 

Why We Need You
If you've never been involved in a theatrical production, you may not understand why we're asking for thousands of dollars. So to give you an idea, here's just a light sampling of the resources we need to put this show together:

Thespis Festival participation fee
director fee
actors (of course)
a lighting designer
a sound designer
a cue board operator
a stage manager
a set designer
props
set-building materials
a costume designer
costumes
audition space
rehearsal space
promotional material
security fees
a photographer
a videographer
IndieGoGo platform fees
printing costs for perks...

You get the idea.
 

""How can I help?""
Glad you asked!
Theatrical productions are incredibly resource-intensive, and every little bit counts. So whether you can donate $1, $100 or $1,000, we'll be profoundly grateful either way! 
***NOTE: Thespis Theater Festival does not allow us to comp tickets for people. Meaning, we can't include tickets in the perks [sad face]. So please be mindful: regardless of what you donate to this fund, you must buy your live show tickets separately. You can purchase your tickets HERE.

We have seen walls go up where before there was the terrain of shared history.  Regardless of affiliation, we have seen some of the ugliest aspects of America emerge into the daylight from their dormant resting place.At its core, Shadow Tender is our response to the growing trend of dehumanization and demonization across many spheres - political, social, and environmental. This profound desire to create an “other” - to create an enemy on which to project all of one’s hatred - extends beyond the containers of culture, language, or geography. On a macro level, this turns into radical nationalism...on a much more intimate, individual level, it is an ongoing battle with personal shame, fear, anger, and vulnerability.News networks swamped with pitched arguments rather than factual reporting, self-congratulatory unfriendings on social media, and tense facades of normalcy at family gatherings all reveal the limitations of verbal dialogue in relation to these topics.  Shadow Tender has grown from a desire to see how our skills as artists, movers, performers, and designers can offer alternative ways to enter the conversation. The Shadow Tender project is so much more than a single performance - it is also an ongoing dialogue with ourselves and our communities that seeks to broaden our notions of what it means to be human; what it means to bridge the gap between “us” and “them.” Our goal is to create both a performance and a teaching methodology that uses mask-making, conversation, and movement to provide our communities with tools for communicating with and learning from their own Shadows, ultimately allowing us to confront things that have been abandoned and pushed away on both personal and societal levels.Your contribution to the Shadow Tender project on any level helps us encourage much-needed dialogue around topics of conflict, trauma, shame, identity, anger, and bias that bypass regular ego-defenses around power/lessness, fragility, and privilege and allow people to see each other as mutually human. Shadow Tender is a performance project that combines physical theatre and wearable sculpture to externalize the parts of ourselves we fear and repress in order to engage a dialogue and promote individual and social healing.Carl Jung described the Shadow as the aspect of the psyche in which we store those parts of ourselves that we do not wish to acknowledge - things that make us feel ashamed, frightened, weak, or powerless. In rejecting our own Shadows, we unconsciously project them onto others, creating monsters and enemies that are more revealing of our own darkness than anything else.Shadow Tender is both a performance and a teaching methodology focusing on how we construct, project, and can compassionately confront and transmute the monstrous within ourselves and society. Jung identified Shadow projection as one of the roots of discrimination against marginalized communities. The political and socio-ecological events of the past year in the US and abroad have made it evident that there is a profound need for dialogue with the personal and collective Shadow self, inciting a sense of urgency for the creation of Shadow Tender.Shadow Tender features a team of talented performers/artists from diverse cultural and movement backgrounds, ranging from ballet, butoh, and modern dance to circus and martial arts.  We’ll be utilizing awesome tools such as biofeedback technology, masks, and prosthetics to create a sense of wonder and transformation. Using our personal stories as conduits and reflections of a larger experience, Shadow Tender looks beyond our egos' defenses to ask these questions: Who is the monster, here? How do we create the monstrous? How does it create us? What lies beyond the fear? We have been invited to perform Shadow Tender and teach a workshop at the 2017 World Stage Design festival to be held at Taipei National University of the Arts this coming July.World Stage Design is one of the largest international performance design festivals in the world and provides an exciting cross-section of work from the realms of theater, dance, installation, site-specific events, and entertainment. Due to the highly international nature of WSD - over 36 countries will be represented - there is also a strong emphasis on building global community, cultural exchange, and fostering dialogue that expands and challenges existing definitions of the performing arts.Your contributions go directly towards allowing us to finalize our costumes and choreography for Shadow Tender and getting us to Taiwan to represent the US at this incredible event. We are asking for a total sum of $11,000. This money will go towards covering round-trip travel costs to Taiwan, materials for costumes, wearable biofeedback technology, marketing/video production, and of course, compensating the artists for their time. So far, we have covered most of the expenses out-of-pocket, but our vision for the project exceeds our current resources.Here is the exact breakdown of our projected costs (with a graph - who doesn’t love graphs?)Round-trip airfare to Taiwan for three performers: $ 3,600Costumes & biofeedback technology: $1,500Video production: $1,500Marketing: $450Compensation for artists: $ 3,000Studio space rental: $950 We are offering tons of exciting perks to our contributors - digital, physical, and other. Many of them will allow you to join us as we move forward with this project. From sneak-peeks into our process and research archives, to original concept art, to custom-made masks and adornments, we have a plethora of amazing awards for you to choose from, with some surprises lined up for after the launch of the campaign!We understand that flex-funding is always a risk - what if we aren’t able to meet our budget goals? Each and every member of our creative team has made major changes in our lives to take on this project and to see it through. Very simply put, we believe in this work, and we believe that it is necessary now. Thus, regardless of how much money we are able to raise, we will continue moving forward with Shadow Tender in whatever way we can. Below is a breakdown of what will happen based on the amount we are able to raise through this campaign.$3,000: We will premiere a bare-bones version of Shadow Tender in Portland, Oregon in July 2017 and hold a Q & A session afterwards for our audience.$5,000: We will premiere a fully robust version Shadow Tender in Portland, Oregon in July 2017 as well as hold a workshop for our local community.$7,000: We will be able to present a simplified version of Shadow Tender and teach a workshop at WSD 2017!$11,000: We will be able to present the full version of Shadow Tender and teach a workshop at WSD 2017! We are a bi-coastal creative team of artists, movers, and educators. We each have a strong track-record of leadership, responsibility, and professional success in our areas of expertise. Natalya, Aurelia, and Maria have collaborated in the past as the Anatomia Dance Collective - an internationally award-winning performance project whose designs have been featured in multiple exhibitions and venues throughout the world, including the A. A. Bakhrushin Theatre Museum in Moscow, the Chinese Institute of Stage Design in Beijing, and the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama, Cardiff.We are thrilled to be joined by Magda, Sophia, and Adam for Shadow Tender - come meet our full team below!Natalya's online portfolio can be found here.

<h3>Help Stop High School Bullying! </h3>
<p>""Lines in the Sand"" a new play written by Jim Dalglish and directed by Jim Dalglish and Ian Ryan has been chosen as an official selection for this year's International Dublin Gay Theatre Festival. The play, which will have its world premiere at Cotuit Center for the Arts from March 9 - 26, 2017, is hard-hitting contemporary drama about an important topic - high school bullying of LGBT teens.  <br/><br/>Here are some disturbing facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>9 out of 10 LGBT teens report being bullied at school because of their sexual orientation or gender</li>
<li>1/3 of the schools did nothing to help them </li>
<li>More than a 1/4 of those student end up dropping out of school </li>
<li>Gay, lesbian, and transgender teens are 3x more likely to commit suicide than other youths</li>
</ul>
<p>""Lines in the Sand"" is an important play that gives voice to the issue of violence and intimidation directed at our LGBT youth. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>We hope to send the play to Dublin and perform it in the festival May 8 - 14, 2017. But first we have to raise the money.  In order to spread the word about this important topic and share the play with the people of Ireland, we need your help.<br/>Our projected expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise $12,000.00 to get the cast and crew to Ireland and back </li>
<li>Airfare will cost about $4,000.00 </li>
<li>We anticipate lodging for 12 days will cost at least $5,000.00</li>
<li>We are projecting incidental costs - shipping, rentals, stipends, daily expenses - to run about $3,000.00</li>

<p>At its core, Maligrad Contemporary Dance Company is about community, collaboration, artistic research, and investigation. The company began in 2014 in Croatia and has since established roots in San Francisco. While we cherish the community we call home and find constant inspiration from the artists we share space with, we find it essential to broaden our knowledge, experience, and sensitivity to the world through cross-cultural exchange. </p>
<p>With dance as our medium and an educational mindset at the forefront, Maligrad will be embarking on a European tour in May and June of 2017 to perform our most recent works, teach, and reconnect with our roots as a contemporary dance company founded in the EU.</p>
<p>Maligrad has been invited to perform and lead workshops with the students at the Accademia dell'Arte in Arezzo Italy. We will spend a week at the University and within the town engaging with the students and faculty and performing our most recent evening-length work, “Archival”. In addition, we will be performing a new site-specific work, “Ping-Pong State of Mind”, intended to bring interactions and cross-cultural exchanges to the viewer. This same site-specific work will be performed in Amsterdam with the potential of other tour stops, all with video documentation allowing for reflection and engagement post-tour. Lastly, Artistic Director Molly Fletcher Lynch-Seaver will be traveling to Villennes Sur Seine, France, where she will be performing, teaching and setting new work on students there. </p>
<p>We feel that this tour is both culturally timely and necessary for us as educators and artists to continue to impact the community we engage with as performing artists. Maligrad is continuing to grow and develop, but financial support enables us to go further than we are otherwise able. Individual funding to this tour will not only make it a reality, it will enable the mission to grow and expand to other locations.</p>
<p>All funds will directly support and enable the following:</p>
<p><i>-Travel costs</i></p>
<p><i>-Artist fees</i></p>
<p><i>-Documentation (photography, videography)</i></p>
<p><i>-Marketing </i></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE- NOW PART OF THE CAMDEN FRINGE FESTIVAL</strong><br/>MACBETH 360 will be exhibited at The Cockpit on August 1st. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>MACBETH 360 is all about generating an experience influenced by early video games, with the audience member sitting in place of Macbeth himself. In this way we create a first person connection and involvement with the context of the play.</p>
<p>More than just the violence and intensity of Shakespeare’s words, MACBETH 360 is going to be an intense immersive Sci-Fi experience, mostly influenced by Cyberpunk and BDSM fashion. The choice to adapt Macbeth’s witches’ ritual scenes within a 360 format comes from an interest in the current issues with an aggressive flux of information, and how this damages our capacity to be empathetic.What is empathy? How can one provoke it through immersive performance? And with this in mind, how can one use new technologies to support and explore the previous question?</p>
<p><strong><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We have already constructed and filmed the performative elements of the piece, now we </span>just<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> need to animate it and bring it to life!</span></font></strong></p>
<p>Once animation has been completed we will then be exhibiting MACBETH 360 as an installation along side the 360 experience, placing the audience member in a real life setting which is an extension of the virtual one.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>What we need:</strong></p>
<p>We are aiming for a sum of £1400 in order to continue on with our project and cover the costs already spent. We have been working with the amazing BoxHead VR who have donated their time and equipment, so our overhead costs have been minimised hugely.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>What the money is going towards:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Animator - £300</strong><br/>We are looking to hire an animation student from the university who will be working on the piece for approximately one week. Keeping the project predominantly between students is something that we are very interested in, and obviously helps massively cost wise, but we are tired of artists being expected to work for free!</p>
<p><strong>Materials- £600</strong><br/>The set up for what has already been filmed came to £300 for set build and costume (metal, green screen materials, costume materials etc), in order to create the installation for the performance we will need a further £300 (to be spent on yes, more metal)</p>
<p><strong>Transport- £200</strong><br/>To keep costs low we have been sourcing metal and other materials from scrap yards which has been great, but then we've had to get them back to our studio, and bus drivers aren't very happy to let on huge pieces of scrap, so we've had to hire transit vans, and will continue to need to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Books- £300</strong><br/>With the installation we are designing a book to be viewed with it which describes the experience and its process of creation. As this project is also for our degree show, we are aiming to manufacture copies for most of our team members to be able to present at our final review (which then decides on our overall grade) to concisely represent the experience.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>Some people are unable to donate, and we understand that, if you have an interest in the project but are unable to contribute financially, you can still help! Please share the campaign with others that you think may be interested and help us continue our project!</p>

More than just the violence and intensity of Shakespeare’s words, MACBETH 360 is going to be an intense immersive Sci-Fi experience, mostly influenced by Cyberpunk and BDSM fashion. The choice to adapt Macbeth’s witches’ ritual scenes within a 360 format comes from an interest in the current issues with an aggressive flux of information, and how this damages our capacity to be empathetic.What is empathy? How can one provoke it through immersive performance? And with this in mind, how can one use new technologies to support and explore the previous question?
We have already constructed and filmed the performative elements of the piece, now we just need to animate it and bring it to life!
Once animation has been completed we will then be exhibiting MACBETH 360 as an installation along side the 360 experience, placing the audience member in a real life setting which is an extension of the virtual one.

What we need:
We are aiming for a sum of £1400 in order to continue on with our project and cover the costs already spent. We have been working with the amazing BoxHead VR who have donated their time and equipment, so our overhead costs have been minimised hugely. 
What the money is going towards:
Animator - £300We are looking to hire an animation student from the university who will be working on the piece for approximately one week. Keeping the project predominantly between students is something that we are very interested in, and obviously helps massively cost wise, but we are tired of artists being expected to work for free!
Materials- £600The set up for what has already been filmed came to £300 for set build and costume (metal, green screen materials, costume materials etc), in order to create the installation for the performance we will need a further £300 (to be spent on yes, more metal)
Transport- £200To keep costs low we have been sourcing metal and other materials from scrap yards which has been great, but then we've had to get them back to our studio, and bus drivers aren't very happy to let on huge pieces of scrap, so we've had to hire transit vans, and will continue to need to do so.
Books- £300With the installation we are designing a book to be viewed with it which describes the experience and its process of creation. As this project is also for our degree show, we are aiming to manufacture copies for most of our team members to be able to present at our final review (which then decides on our overall grade) to concisely represent the experience.
 

Some people are unable to donate, and we understand that, if you have an interest in the project but are unable to contribute financially, you can still help! Please share the campaign with others that you think may be interested and help us continue our project!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>ABOUT THE SHOW:</h3>
<p>Written by John Cariani,</p>
<p>ALMOST, MAINE: It’s love. But not quite.</p>
<p>Welcome to Almost, Maine, a town that’s so far north, it’s almost not in the United States—it’s almost in Canada. And it almost doesn't exist. Because its residents never got around to getting organized. So it’s just…Almost.</p>
<p>One cold, clear Friday night in the middle of winter, while the northern lights hover in the sky above, Almost’s residents find themselves falling in and out of love in the strangest ways. Knees are bruised. Hearts are broken. Love is lost, found, and confounded. And life for the people of Almost, Maine will never be the same. It’s love. But not quite. </p>

<p>""We were only 19 back then. He told me about his failed suicide attempt. And I thought I understood him. But I didn’t. After he died from suicide two years later, I kept going back to that cafe conversation. Again and again, I tried to dig out every clue that may tell me why he took his own life. Again and Again, I failed. From what I experienced, <strong>Mr.Crow</strong>, was born. He flies freely like a crow, dances at his own funeral, and laughs at those who tried to cover up his suicide with a simple reason.""  ---Changting Lu, Creative Producing MFA Candidate at CalArts,</p>
<p>Written and directed by <strong>Changting Lu, </strong><i><strong>Mr. Crow</strong></i> is a <strong>multimedia interactive performance</strong> that explores the complexity and controversy of <strong>suicide</strong> through the lens of <strong>personal memory. </strong>It is a story of <strong>the living trying vainly to reconnect with the dead</strong>, facing the guiltiness of his not being able to prevent his friend’s suicide, and defending the dignity of the deceased in a society that views suicide as a crime. </p>
<p>We are asking our audience to put down all the judgements on suicide, and try to understand: <strong>How does it actually feel to stand on the edge of suicide? How does it actually feel to lose someone to suicide?</strong> How are the way we talks about suicide (or, the way we avoid talking about suicide), influencing those who’re suffering from suicidal thoughts? <strong>And why are these questions related to EVERYONE of us?</strong></p>
<p>With voice recording devices, DV camera, live-feed projection, the performance digs into the <strong>aftermath of suicide</strong> by revisiting and recreating fragmented memories stored in multiple media. </p>
<p>It will open on <strong>January 26th</strong> at <strong>2019's Company Creation Festival @ Son of Semele Theatre, Los Angeles. </strong>We have a long way to go in order to bring Mr. Crow to life. Our team, aided by your support, hopes to resurrect this lost memory in the City of Angles.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The creative team of Mr.Crow believes that <strong>theater is a process rather than a product</strong>, and to achieve our goal of <strong>“opening up conversations about a taboo issue”</strong>, we need to take the challenge to make to process as open as possible. With your support, we can really delve into a project that <strong>excites and challenges us</strong> at the same time. And we are committed to create a <strong>more diverse and creative greater theatrical community</strong>. Together, we can facilitate an experience for audience members, create opportunities for <strong>underrepresented artists</strong> to devise work, and share that voice with those most in need of <strong>diverse perspective</strong>.</p>

Your support will go directly towards renting rehearsal and performance space, costumes, props, design elements, and marketing efforts (playbills, flyers, video and photo campaigns). And most importantly for paying our amazing actors, directors, stage managers and designers! 
When you contribute you will be able to come and see us perform at Son of Semele Theatre on Jan 26/27, Feb 6/7/8 (WOW!!!)
In addition you'll get awesome rewards, depending on your giving level, from social media shout-out, T-shirts, posters, shopping bags, to opportunities attending our open rehearsals and free performance tickets! See giving levels on the right.
Every bit of your help will make this project into reality! We really really appreciate your donations and support! 

The Impact
The creative team of Mr.Crow believes that theater is a process rather than a product, and to achieve our goal of “opening up conversations about a taboo issue”, we need to take the challenge to make to process as open as possible. With your support, we can really delve into a project that excites and challenges us at the same time. And we are committed to create a more diverse and creative greater theatrical community. Together, we can facilitate an experience for audience members, create opportunities for underrepresented artists to devise work, and share that voice with those most in need of diverse perspective.

When the Spaniards looked for hospitable land here in the New World, they settled here.  Flamenco prevails as testimony to a civilization evolving in complexity. San Antonio emerges parallel to Spain in many ways for her climate, culture, and landscape, with the art of flamenco very much a presence in our daily lives.  </p><p>A true sign of advancement in a civilization is the arts.  Arte y Pasión, a member of San Antonio Dance Umbrella, has been a major player in the dance and music community of San Antonio and Texas since 2010.

Your contribution will help these artists continue to pursue their work and continue to perfect their art.Travel: Your funds will help defray costs of travel for visiting artists. Classes and continued study: Your contribution will enable us to continue our studies and continue to improve our work. Administrative costs: Your funds will defray the costs for our proposal team, who works hours and hours preparing documents for each production, press releases, publicity, and administrative support. We have amazing perks which we are offering, which will help us come closer to our goal, while being very fun for you as well! The ImpactThis project is valuable to me, and it is valuable to the world because we are using the art of flamenco as a vehicle to spread the message of kindness, peace, and compassion.  The art of flamenco is here and strong in San Antonio for a definitive reason. When the Spaniards looked for hospitable land here in the New World, they settled here.  Flamenco prevails as testimony to a civilization evolving in complexity. San Antonio emerges parallel to Spain in many ways for her climate, culture, and landscape, with the art of flamenco very much a presence in our daily lives.  A true sign of advancement in a civilization is the arts.  Arte y Pasión, a member of San Antonio Dance Umbrella, has been a major player in the dance and music community of San Antonio and Texas since 2010. We explore evolution and specific subject matter while preserving the foundation of the great art form, inscribed in 2010 by UNESCO on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.  We have participated as an a DreamWeek Partner and with the Artist Foundation. Our Track RecordWhile we've been producing work since 2009, here are the recent projects we've done, on Human Rights issues: 2019  Vuelo. A project on the migration of butterflies as it relates to our immigrants and the gifts they bring.2019  Estrellas. A project on genetic memory in descendants of holocaust survivors.2018  Aguitas. A project telling the universal story of Immigrants through the ages.

As the reality of this international tour comes closer, I am grateful for all support I have received and the paths that have been laid to make this possible.</p>
<p>Dance for me is beyond entertainment.  It’s a way to touch the lives of others.  I work within the medium of dance as a way to connect with others, and to hopefully provide an experience that inspires, heals, awakens, or brings joy.  It is a vehicle of communication, personal expression, and a powerful tool to share and articulate ideas and experiences.  Working with artists from other countries and communities provides an eye-opening understanding as to how world events, politics, human rights and social justice issues, etc. impact the lives of others in such drastically different ways than what is experienced in our own community.   I am personally and artistically intrigued to see how such worldviews and life experiences affect the aesthetics of artwork created reflecting a larger, more global reality.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHAT WE’RE DOING…</strong></h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>BLACKOUT</i></h3>
<p>BLACKOUT is a one-act, four-character play that explores grief and mental illness and how they affect our lives. Only, instead of our lives, we’re using superheroes.</p> <p>BLACKOUT begins a year after Cassie Robertson AKA Blackout. Her mentor, Kinetic’s, suicide. She struggles to control her powers and her emotions which have begun to wreak havoc on New York City!. On top of that, her deadbeat brother suddenly comes back into her life and the ghosts of her past are invading her mind! Now Cassie must come to grips with her grief and emotions before she destroys the city she’s supposed to protect.</p> <p>The play is told through scenes that take place in the present day and flashbacks in New York City.</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHY WE’RE DOING IT…</strong></h2>
<p>Exploring Mental Illness and Grief and creating more diverse stories featuring queer characters.</p> <p>Mental illness and grief are still difficult to talk about in some communities, and it affects people in different ways. BLACKOUT seeks to explore a specific facet of these two incredibly dense topics. Cassie struggles with her own feelings of anxiety and depression that is only compounded by her unprocessed grief over her mentor’s death - and this affects 8pevery part of her life.</p> <p>Also, every single character in BLACKOUT is queer and queer with a purpose.</p> <p>With this show, we want to:</p> <p>Inspire a discussion about mental illness and its effects on us and our lives: What are the dangers of not getting help and how the refusal of help can affect your relationships.</p>
<p>Promote queer art.</p>
<p>Show that the queer experience goes beyond the traditional narrative and that we tackle issues and problems other than our sexuality.</p> <p>The audience of Blackout’s stage reading this past summer spoke about their connection to the material and stated how excited they were for a show of this nature to get up in its feet! And now we are bringing it to you on May 16th. We’re going to have a full cast, a crew, and an amazing director at the helm. We just need your help to make it all happen.</p>

</div></div>","WHAT WE’RE DOING…
BLACKOUT
BLACKOUT is a one-act, four-character play that explores grief and mental illness and how they affect our lives. Only, instead of our lives, we’re using superheroes. BLACKOUT begins a year after Cassie Robertson AKA Blackout. Her mentor, Kinetic’s, suicide. She struggles to control her powers and her emotions which have begun to wreak havoc on New York City!. On top of that, her deadbeat brother suddenly comes back into her life and the ghosts of her past are invading her mind! Now Cassie must come to grips with her grief and emotions before she destroys the city she’s supposed to protect. The play is told through scenes that take place in the present day and flashbacks in New York City. WHY WE’RE DOING IT…
Exploring Mental Illness and Grief and creating more diverse stories featuring queer characters. Mental illness and grief are still difficult to talk about in some communities, and it affects people in different ways. BLACKOUT seeks to explore a specific facet of these two incredibly dense topics. Cassie struggles with her own feelings of anxiety and depression that is only compounded by her unprocessed grief over her mentor’s death - and this affects 8pevery part of her life. Also, every single character in BLACKOUT is queer and queer with a purpose. With this show, we want to: Inspire a discussion about mental illness and its effects on us and our lives: What are the dangers of not getting help and how the refusal of help can affect your relationships.
Promote queer art.
Show that the queer experience goes beyond the traditional narrative and that we tackle issues and problems other than our sexuality. The audience of Blackout’s stage reading this past summer spoke about their connection to the material and stated how excited they were for a show of this nature to get up in its feet! And now we are bringing it to you on May 16th. We’re going to have a full cast, a crew, and an amazing director at the helm. We just need your help to make it all happen.

What do we need? What am I paying for?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Rebbekah Ogden is producing her Final Project Salt Water Moon at Arts Commons, Motel Theatre in Calgary March 13, 14 and 15 2020.</p>
<p>Salt Water Moon is a Canadian classic by David French. This delightful two hander tells the story of Jacob Mercer trying to win back Mary Snow's heart, after leaving her high and dry for Toronto a year ago. However, his welcome home might not be as warm as he was hoping for.</p>
<p>As a graduating student of Rosebud School of the Arts, Rebbekah must produce and act in a show of her choosing before becoming an FRSA (Fellow Rosebud School of the Arts) guild member. For the last three and a half years, Rebbekah has been studying the performing arts and is now getting ready to showcase some of the concepts she has been learning. </p>
<p>A final project however isn't only time consuming it is also expensive and Rebbekah must come up with the funds herself. That is why she is asking you to help cover expenses such as venue rental, set materials and costume build.</p>
<p>Your contribution would mean, helping Rebbekah graduate and helping her team produce a show of quality and creativity. </p>

</div><div>
<p>Rebbekah has assembled a team of mostly emerging artists. Her desire is to create an opportunity for emerging artists to showcase their work.

<p>After Graduating from theatre schools, artists have the difficult job of getting their work seen by the professional community, building a sustainable resume can take years.

<h3>What is ""theatre magic""?</h3>
<p>Since its inception, Kidz Theater has been asking this question.  What is ""theatre magic""?  How do you achieve that ""x factor""?</p>
<p>When Kristen Caesar, artistic director, began the company in San Diego in the late 90s, she set out on a quest to make that magic tangible for young performers.  Kidz Theater, its performers, and its staff have now spanned two coasts and over two decades on a quest to find what each performer's brand of magic is.  With a passionate leader in Kristen and a love for the art form of musical theater in each person who comes to Kidz Theater, our quest to make magic tangible becomes more and more real for a new child every single day.</p>
<p>But we can't do it alone.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>When Magic Meets Reality</h3>
<p>The cost of producing a show in New York City is high.  Like--insanely high.</p>
<p>Money goes toward the rights for shows, rehearsal space, theater rentals, props, costumes, transport rentals, lighting, sound, and pretty much everything else you can think of that goes into making a show. </p>
<p>And with a broad pool of talent in the tri-state area, we want to remain low cost and accessible to performers so that no child or teen who comes to us wanting to learn is turned away by the cost of tuition.  Thus was born our scholarship program.  We need to make sure we can keep our scholarships so that our program never becomes only for the people who can pay.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Should I Care?</h3>
<p>Kidz Theater is one of the only educational theater programs in New York City that offers professional training through productions and classes.  Not only that, Kidz Theater offers opportunities for kids and teens to work behind the scenes; such as board operation, stage management, sound design, and producing. </p>
<p>Our alumn are currently at musical theater programs across the country, on tour with major productions such as Frozen and <i>Dear Evan Hansen</i>, and have appeared on Broadway in <i>Dear Evan Hansen, Diana, The Cher Show, West Side Story, </i>among others.</p>
<p>Kidz Theater also provides a home for several kids and teens that need the space to grow and evolve as performers.  Our disappearance would cause the performing arts in New York City to suffer greatly.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>It Won't Be Easy</h3>
<p>Money is tight.  We get it.  But with a network of over 500 alumni (who have gone on to be performers, stage managers, or even doctors), and parents (whose careers span the gamut), we know you all believe in Kidz Theater.  And we know you can get others to believe in Kidz Theater, because our work speaks for itself.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>I'm SO Broke.  How Else Can I Help?</h3>
<p>The best thing you can do is spread the word.  Share this campaign on your Twitter, or Insta, or Finsta, or wherever you can.  Call your friends and dictate the url to them out loud if you have to.  But word of mouth has always been first and foremost how Kidz Theater survives.</p>
<p>Also, we are always looking for the donations of goods/services to add to our incentives to donate.  If you can offer a 1-hour private lesson, or tickets to a Broadway show; anything that can enrich this campaign and the performers we know (and those we don't, yet!), that is a welcome service.</p>

<h3>Who are we?...</h3>
<p>Hot Coals Theatre formed, in 2012, of core members Clare-Louise English and Jo Sargeant. We met whilst studying together on the first ever year of the MA Theatre Lab course at RADA.</p>
<p>We, Hot Coals Theatre, believe in theatre, we believe in the power of theatre to change the world, but we believe we can do it with a lightness of touch and with laughter: laugh at us, to laugh at life. </p>
<p>We are a clown, mask and physical theatre company who takes inspiration from the likes of Charlie Chaplin. His sensitivity and detailed work is something we try to emulate and his belief in tackling hard-hitting issues with the lightest of touch sits right at the core of our work.</p>
<p>As one deaf and one hearing performer, accessibility is close to our hearts and we make work that is inclusive to Deaf and hearing audiences in a shared experience.</p>

<h3>A brief synopsis...</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, deep in the heart of the forest, a woodcutter goes about life in a world of woodland magic. One day a stranger knocks at his door bringing with her a most unexpected of spells... But when the pressures of social expectation worms its way between them, bringing confusion to their hearts, a choice must be made; stay and conform or run and be free...</p>

<h3>Our Mission!</h3>
<p>Edinburgh is undoubtedly one of the most expensive festivals to be a part of and though we have some funds, there is a shortfall we need your help with.</p>
<p>Being programmed by such an exciting and respected venue puts us in a superb position to be able to gather interest for our international tour. With your help we can make the absolute most of this opportunity.</p>
<p>We have managed to raise the first chunk of what we need to pay deposits for our accommodation and for the venue, insurances, and marketing. However, we still need to cover two important areas:</p>
<p>Balance of our accommodation cost: £1450 </p>
<p>Team (technical Stage Manager + designers): £2500</p>
<p>Help us to spread the word about accessible theatre by supporting our campaign and we will be grateful… forever!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Of course, as with any ambitious project there comes a certain amount of risk, mostly financial. Edinburgh Festival is an enormous festival, with hundreds of shows competing for audiences. </p>
<p>However, we do have a plan and we have done a lot of the leg work already to minimise this risk, and this is why we are here asking for your support...</p>
<p>If we are able to raise the funds to secure the bulk of our expenses before we go, we can minimise the risk. Making sure we have funds set in place to pay our team, means we do not need to rely on unpredictable ticket sales. Paying for our accommodation upfront means we won't be handed a large bill after, and so on.</p>
<p>We don't expect for the festival to make us rich (although, that would be lovely), but that is not the aim of this run. The aim is more long term than that. It's to reach out across the world and let them know we are here, making great, Inclusive work, that they want to share with their audiences back home.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Everyone knows someone who likes  to go to a show, or has a friend who lives in Edinburgh, or that person who loves a good cause, or even knows someone who is d/Deaf who may not know about us yet!</p>
<p>If you can't support us financially but are keen to get involved. Then please share this campaign with your networks and spread the word. Think of those you know who might be interested in supporting or evening buying tickets! Every share, every email might just get us that little bit closer!</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Möbius Dance is a Leeds based dance company that supports and nurtures talented, up-and-coming dance artists and choreographers both creatively and practically. </p>
<p>Möbius Dance helps early career dance artists grow artistically and break down the barriers faced at the beginning of their careers by offering quality employment prospects.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016 by Artistic Director Gianluca Vincentini, we place dance at the heart of our activities, productions and outreach and offer spaces to learn, discover and rediscover, be challenged and be moved.  </p>
<p>This project will offer an amazing opportunity for each participant to be empowered in their learning process, and to take full ownership of their work, as they are given access to a new international scene.</p>
<p>We will encourage skills development and practice sharing through: open classes lead by the Artistic Director and the dancers; discussions; rehearsal exchanges. </p>
<p>The project will also create opportunities to engage the Malaysian and UK public via open rehearsals and class. During our residency the public can drop in for an hour and be given a real behind-the-scenes experience. We will lead informal Q&amp;A session with attendees. They can also decide to sketch or simply enjoy the rehearsal. </p>
<p>Please feel free to share the campaign with dance, education and culture lovers, and with anyone who might be interested to entrepreneurially invest in a company that believes in making inclusive and ethical change. </p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>

<p>Although £4000 is a really big target, <strong>we have already secured accommodation, per-diems, salaries and visa for the dancers and our AD</strong>. </p>

A Thread is the latest project by Jean Abreu Dance and is an international collaboration with the celebrated artist and sculptor from Sao Paulo, Elisa Bracher and it is for this extraordinary and ambitious collaboration that  we ask you for your generous help and support in the completion and premier of this production in Brazil ,at the ""Auditorio Ibirapuera"" in Sao Paulo.
A Thread brings together Jean Abreu’s intense and visceral choreographic
language with gravity-defying, brutal sculptures by acclaimed Brazilian artist
Elisa Bracher.  This hour long performance is a powerful exploration
of the concept of Balance which takes the audience on an emotional journey
following an incredible cast of 5 virtuoso international dance artists in a
heroic attempt to find balance. The piece
subliminally hints at the Greek mythological story of Sisyphuswho carries the weight of a rock up the hill for eternity as
punishment for cheating the gods.


“Each
atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night filled mountain, in itself
forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's
heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy” ‪‎Albert Camus ‪ The Myth of Sisyphus
Ultimately A Thread deals with an universal question, that of our own
weight and our sense of balance, weight that we carry through life, our
bodies, and the Balance that we endlessly try to achieve. The show features specially commissioned music by the
Ukrainian Composer Heinali   (Oleg Shpudeiko) which will be performed by two live musicians (viola &
Theorbo ) together with 16th century Baroque music - Johan Downland and Montiverdi .
The Pitch 

A Thread world premier in Sao Paulo , what do we need and why:
Since July 2015 we have been in ongoing discussions with the world
famous “Auditorio Ibirabuera” Concert Hall in Sao Paulo, one of Brazils most
prestigious and beautiful  performance venues at the heart of Sao Paulo which was designed by the renowned architect  Oscar Niemeyer  .Auditorio Ibirapuera  wishes to host the premier A Thread on
the 15th and 16th of April 2016. We  are truly ecstatic  with this incredible opportunity  to premier A Thread and presenting the piece in a world class venue will give the project the right push we so need for its success .  We don't want to miss this opportunity and that is why we are reaching out to you.

                              
Despite the financial support already offered by institutions
both in Brazil ( Itau Cultural Foundation)and UK( Arts Council of Englandand the British Council   )we are short of the necessary funds to complete and premier this exciting project.  
The performance fees and
expenses we are offered for the show only cover half of the real costs to take
a large group abroad. In order to make this performance in Sao Paulo to the highest
standard and make most of this extraordiniray opportunity we need to raise a
further £12 000 to take on the road a
total of 11 people
Help us to achieve our
goal please support A Thread world premier in Sao Paulo at the Auditorio Ibirapuera on 15th and 16th of
april 2016.
Your help will directly support artist travels as well as logistic and productions cost , rehearsal space, expenses and accommodation costs allowing us to complete the journey of this incredible  Project

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><i>Lost Paradise</i> is a modern dance version of the jukebox musical format, taking 5 previously choreographed works, weaving them with new choreographic/theatrical material, and creating a new narrative, which strives to question our never ending quest(s) in finding our perfect mate: the One. How honest are we in our search? Is the persona we present to people we meet the real 'us', or a made up version to hide our true self? The project is an immersive experience for audiences: not where audiences just sit and assume the role of a typical passive dance viewer. It combines modern dance choreography, acting, both live singing, lip-syncing and karaoke, live-feed video and projection, allowing the public to witness, participate, and engage in the unfolding and development of the performance: building a active relationship with all the participants in the room.</p>
<p><i>Slippage</i> is a new 30-minute dance film which has been directed by actor/director, Jason Kaufman, and choreographed by Maurice Fraga. Slippage started in 2003 in NYC, exploring the boundaries of female to female partnering work. Through many investigations and performances, Slippage has finally evolved to its final state: a physically demanding trio for women, with contact improvisational derived movement, where the movement is brutal, rough, challenging, yet also gentle and calm, and where the protagonist must find a final resolution to a traumatic memory  that haunts her.</p><p>UPDATE: March 9th, Slippage has earned an Award of Merit Special Mention (Experimental Category) from The Accolade Global Film Competition!</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b>
</p><p>
</p><p><i>Ekilibre Dance Company</i> (EDCO) was founded in 2006 as the vision and project of choreographer Maurice Fraga. Since its founding, EDCO has continued to develop its activities and profile within the United States and abroad. In 2015, Artistic Director, Maurice Fraga, received a residency grant at the Djerassi Resident Artist Program to focus in on his choreographic theory and process, which eventually lead to his investigation on finding new and innovative ways to interact with audiences.</p>
<p>Having a dance company is an uphill battle to undertake: getting committed and strong dancers to work for minimal compensation, convincing producers to give you a chance to shine, attracting audiences, and of course, finding funding. EDCO is creating this campaign in support of our work, which includes <i>Lost Paradise</i>, and <i>Slippage</i>. We are aiming to raise the money to help cover production costs and film festival submissions.</p>
<p><span>Our $2,500 goal is nothing close to the total needed, but we want to make sure we create a successful campaign to cover some costs. </span></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDCO does NOT currently receive ANY funding (government or private) for the work we produce and present: all costs are paid out by the Artistic Director himself or through any donations giving by supporters. Contributions made to this campaign will allow the company to take another step forward in being able to set up a foundation that will allow EDCO to become a true 501(c)3, begin applying for national and state grants, and ensure that the company is able to keep presenting works.</p>
<p>A lack of tangible experience for the audience inevitably, distances them from engaging in the work, and too often, modern dance choreographers and companies settle and create this type of one-sided performance event. I believe that by creating work that connects to audiences on an emotional and human level, giving them a felt experience, will allow them to see how modern dance can reflect small and large aspects of their lives, ultimately creating an interest in seeing and supporting more dance. Our work is about changing the perception of modern dance, not following the status quo.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>What You Get</b></p>
<p>By donating to our campaign, we would like you to think of it as an <b>investment</b> and not just a <b>handout</b>. You are becoming a friend and a supporter of not just our company, but of dance, and of culture. You are investing in helping Ekilibre and its dancers make a difference, and begin a change in the perception of modern dance. </p>
<p>You support will allow us to make inroads in how to dance can have a larger and more apparent affect on the lives of those performing the works, and those witnessing them. </p>
<p>It would be wonderful to be able to live in a society that think of our jobs as ""real"" jobs and not just hobbies: we do work hard. Just because what we create is not mass produced and sold for commercial use, does not mean it is not valid and important.</p>
<p>We encourage you to donate what you can, and not just think about what item or prize you will get in return. Think about the long-term effect of your contribution, and how it will enable us to begin our dance revolution. </p>

A lack of tangible experience for the audience inevitably, distances them from engaging in the work, and too often, modern dance choreographers and companies settle and create this type of one-sided performance event. I believe that by creating work that connects to audiences on an emotional and human level, giving them a felt experience, will allow them to see how modern dance can reflect small and large aspects of their lives, ultimately creating an interest in seeing and supporting more dance. Our work is about changing the perception of modern dance, not following the status quo.

What You Get
By donating to our campaign, we would like you to think of it as an investment and not just a handout. You are becoming a friend and a supporter of not just our company, but of dance, and of culture. You are investing in helping Ekilibre and its dancers make a difference, and begin a change in the perception of modern dance. 
You support will allow us to make inroads in how to dance can have a larger and more apparent affect on the lives of those performing the works, and those witnessing them. 
It would be wonderful to be able to live in a society that think of our jobs as ""real"" jobs and not just hobbies: we do work hard. Just because what we create is not mass produced and sold for commercial use, does not mean it is not valid and important.
We encourage you to donate what you can, and not just think about what item or prize you will get in return. Think about the long-term effect of your contribution, and how it will enable us to begin our dance revolution. 

Other Ways You Can Help

Even if you can't contribute financially to this campaign, please help by sharing this fundraising effort to anyone who might have an interest in supporting the arts and one that will be making an impact in other ways.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p><b>ABOUT <i>SCUM: a manifesto</i></b></p>
<p>Scantily Glad Theatre premieres its
latest show, <b><i>SCUM: a manifesto</i></b>, created by S.E. Grummett and
Caitlin Zacharias, at the <b>PotashCorp Fringe Theatre Festival in Saskatoon
from July 28th-August 6th at the Broadway Theatre.</b></p>
<p><b><i>SCUM </i></b>interweaves the true story of Valerie Solanas and her encounters
with pop-art legend, Andy Warhol, with two modern day women navigating the
trendy new world of modern feminism. <b><i>SCUM </i></b>satirizes what it
means to be a feminist in today’s society and pokes fun at our modern
misconceptions of gender equality. Witty banter, movement, pop art and
projection create the amusingly dark world of <b><i>SCUM</i></b><i>.</i> Since
its creation, the play has undergone a series of developmental workshops to
evolve it into a full length production. </p>
<p><b><i>SCUM</i></b> is created entirely by students and recent grads of the U of S
Department of Drama program: S.E. Grummett (Writer/Actor), Ivan Kolosnjaji
(Actor), Jessie Kraus (Actor/Props), Meleody Mountain (Stage Manager/Director)
and Caitlin Zacharias (Writer/Actor)</p>
<p><b>ABOUT SCANTILY GLAD THEATRE</b></p>
<p>Founded in 2014, Scantily Glad
Theatre is an emerging Saskatoon-based theatre company. Our goal is to
create original work that provokes laughter, emotion and thought. Scantily Glad
Theatre’s first show, <i>The Loveseat </i>premiered at the PotashCorp Saskatoon
Fringe Festival last summer. <i>The Loveseat </i>told the story of David and
Anna, a young couple going through a divorce, who must reexamine their

<p><b>WHY TELL THIS STORY?</b></p>
<p><i>""I need feminism because it's a
crucial movement towards an complete equal society between men and women. It
demands a world where women have the same rights, opportunities and freedom as
men. I need feminism because I'm constantly under pressure to look, act and be
a certain way. If I wear makeup I'm ""looking for attention"", but if I
don't wear makeup I "" look tired and sick"". If I do something
courageous I ""have balls"", but if I show my vulnerability I'm
""being a pussy"". I do not live in an equal world and neither do you,
anyone who says otherwise is simply wrong.""</i></p>
<p>-Caitlin Zacharias (Writer/Actor)</p>
<p><i>“Feminism gets a bad-rap today. A
recent study found that only 10% of both men and women identify themselves as a
feminist. Even stars like Lady Gaga refuse to use the term “feminist”. But this
is part of the problem. Feminism is about equality. True equality. And there’s
nothing wrong with that. I was immediately intrigued when I first heard about
Valerie Solanas and her S.C.U.M. Manifesto. Her history, her writing, her
relationship with Andy Warhol: right away, I knew this was a story I wanted to
tell. ” </i></p>
<p>-S.E. Grummett (Writer/Actor) </p>
<p> ""<i>When I was first
looked at the S.C.U.M. manifesto I thought it was a satire on the extremist
Feminism so naturally I was shocked to discover that every word was written
earnestly. I think it is important to differentiate this extremist Feminism to
what feminism actually is and how important equality is. I think it’s important
to really look extremist feminism and see it for what it is. This show does
that in a funny and entertaining way and I’m so happy to be a part of making it
happen.""</i></p>

Scantily Glad Theatre premieres its
latest show, SCUM: a manifesto, created by S.E. Grummett and
Caitlin Zacharias, at the PotashCorp Fringe Theatre Festival in Saskatoon
from July 28th-August 6th at the Broadway Theatre.
SCUM interweaves the true story of Valerie Solanas and her encounters
with pop-art legend, Andy Warhol, with two modern day women navigating the
trendy new world of modern feminism. SCUM satirizes what it
means to be a feminist in today’s society and pokes fun at our modern
misconceptions of gender equality. Witty banter, movement, pop art and
projection create the amusingly dark world of SCUM. Since
its creation, the play has undergone a series of developmental workshops to
evolve it into a full length production. 
SCUM is created entirely by students and recent grads of the U of S
Department of Drama program: S.E. Grummett (Writer/Actor), Ivan Kolosnjaji
(Actor), Jessie Kraus (Actor/Props), Meleody Mountain (Stage Manager/Director)
and Caitlin Zacharias (Writer/Actor)
ABOUT SCANTILY GLAD THEATRE
Founded in 2014, Scantily Glad
Theatre is an emerging Saskatoon-based theatre company. Our goal is to
create original work that provokes laughter, emotion and thought. Scantily Glad
Theatre’s first show, The Loveseat premiered at the PotashCorp Saskatoon
Fringe Festival last summer. The Loveseat told the story of David and
Anna, a young couple going through a divorce, who must reexamine their
relationship after they can’t decide who keeps the couch. SCUM: a
manifesto is the second work by Scantily Glad Theatre. 
WHY TELL THIS STORY?
""I need feminism because it's a
crucial movement towards an complete equal society between men and women. It
demands a world where women have the same rights, opportunities and freedom as
men. I need feminism because I'm constantly under pressure to look, act and be
a certain way. If I wear makeup I'm ""looking for attention"", but if I
don't wear makeup I "" look tired and sick"". If I do something

<p>Charlotte and Stuart together once more in the den they shared after University. Crippled by the burden of being in their twenties and subject to what seems will be a lifetime of unrewarding hard graft and inevitable self destruction.

<p>They won't be able to provide for their children, their parents or themselves. You know what. F**k it. YOLO! </p>
<p>Ourselves and Chris met many moons ago at the RSAMD and we cannot quite believe that we are about to embark upon a fringe production together this Summer. A piece written, performed, directed and produced by ourselves. We haven't got a clue what we are doing and we have no one to tell us what to do but we are doing it all the same. We started writing this piece in 2014 and moved up to Glasgow last year and with Chris on board we set to making a production out of it. This happened somehow and with such supportive and exciting feedback we put our plans into motion to get Deadline to the Edinburgh Fringe- a festival we have always wanted to be a part of. Being a part of a production at the festival is wonderful in whatever capacity your involvement but to be taking something that us three pals from drama school have created from scratch feels very special. We are ready to challenge ourselves and we hope that with your support we can really make the most out of this venture. We intend to take our production elsewhere after the fringe and it is really with a look into Deadlines future that we ask for your help. We think it is a play that as well as being entertaining covers topics that, as we have experienced, hit home with our generation and explores issues regarding higher education and employment that plenty of us have been struggling with these past few years. Although these issues may come across as superficial to many it is something that is very real to us and our lives just now- however banal to some. We started writing this play through the themes we decided were most important to us and the drama surrounding them that interests us. It is a journey through the 'twenties crisis'...not knowing where you're going or how you're going to get where you want to go. We found ourselves in such a situation and turned to our creativity to anchor us and this helped spur us on to make our own work. We hope that you will put your faith in us so we can continue a development that we intend to see through to the end. </p>

<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>To be able to provide all the opportunities that we can in this first production we need to raise the minimum of £3000. This covers the cost of rehearsal space, basic set and props, advertising and the venue at the frige</p>
<p>Other risks include lack of an audience which will hinder the team being paid.</p>
<p>Failure to deliver the project due to lack of funding</p>
<p>As with any kind of theatre project, there are inherent risks such as cast illnesses or unforeseen production delays and we'll be relying on the skills, experience and talents of our established and hard-working team, as well as working closely with our partners and supporters, to ensure these risk are mitigated as much as possible.</p>

<h3><strong>Creating a New Theater Space for Millennials</strong></h3>
<p>The Akron Civic Theatre is partnering with Millennial Theatre Company to bridge the gap between youth and adult community theater opportunities for young adults ages 18-35 (Millennials). Together, the organizations will create a theatrical space for Millennial voices – for both theater-makers and theatergoers -- and expand Summit County’s arts menu to serve and to speak to an under-represented demographic in community theater. </p>
<p>The Civic will act as an incubator and fiscal agent for Millennial Theatre Company. As a regional cultural center that works with myriad nonprofit performing arts organizations each year, the Akron Civic Theatre has both the experience and the infrastructure to mentor this startup venture and help get it off the ground.</p>
<p>The partnership begins with the staging of <strong>Heathers: The Musical</strong>, based on the deliciously dark-humored teen cult film classic, presented Friday, July 22 through Sunday, July 24 in the Civic's intimate cabaret format, where the audience members join the actors on stage. (Ticket information is available <a href=""http://www.AkronCivic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.AkronCivic.com</a>.)</p>
<p>The goal of this Indiegogo campaign is to secure $2,000 to offset expenses for the production of <strong>Heathers: The Musical</strong>, specifically the costs of royalties, professional stagehands and costuming.</p>
<h3><strong>Filling the Theater Gap </strong></h3>
<p>For the last five years, the Civic’s All-City Musical has been very successful in bringing together Summit County’s most talented high school-aged performers with theater professionals to present an annual, fully staged, professional-quality musical theater production.</p>
<p>We have discovered along the way that many teenagers who “age out” of local youth theater and the traditional arts education system are still interested in participating in theater and would like to take on more mature content. However, they are not necessarily finding opportunities -- either on stage or backstage -- in adult community theater, and there are very few circumstances in which they can serve in roles of artistic leadership. They are also seeking theater experiences that reflect and speak to their own experiences, interests and values. </p>
<p>Extending the All-City Musical model by working together, the Civic and Millennial Theatre Company will engage this audience of actors and theatergoers. The repertoire focuses on content that is generation-relevant, and the production process  reflects a decidedly non-traditional approach. For instance, the Company embraces non-traditional casting choices and a democratic process (vs. a hierarchical one) in which all players participate in shaping the production.</p>

<h2>What's so awesome about this project? </h2>
<p>In a Nutshell: Our first reading of <i>Girls in White Dresses</i> happened in April, in the lobby of the Phoenix Theater--casual, over beers and pizza. The reading itself only took 40 minutes.<br/>The conversation it prompted afterwards was 90 minutes.  <br/>Sitting around with these talented, smart, young actresses of color and listening to them talk so openly about what it means to be a woman-- in the world, in theater, in these cities...we realized just how vital this conversation was and all the ways it has been denied to us. <br/>Along with our talented cast we will use our favorite theatrical elements: devised movement and music, a surreal set, puppetry, projection,  and lots of fight choreography (!) to bring Cristina's powerful and poetic words to life. <br/>We are excited and fortunate to have the opportunity to share this gorgeous play with our wider community, Help us make this show a reality!!<br/><br/><b>Synopsis: </b> <br/><i>Girls in White Dresses</i> is a lyrical imagining of the final days of four of history's forgotten daughters - Olga, Tatiana, Marie, and Anastasia Romanov.

</div></div>","What's so awesome about this project? 
In a Nutshell: Our first reading of Girls in White Dresses happened in April, in the lobby of the Phoenix Theater--casual, over beers and pizza. The reading itself only took 40 minutes.The conversation it prompted afterwards was 90 minutes.  Sitting around with these talented, smart, young actresses of color and listening to them talk so openly about what it means to be a woman-- in the world, in theater, in these cities...we realized just how vital this conversation was and all the ways it has been denied to us. Along with our talented cast we will use our favorite theatrical elements: devised movement and music, a surreal set, puppetry, projection,  and lots of fight choreography (!) to bring Cristina's powerful and poetic words to life. We are excited and fortunate to have the opportunity to share this gorgeous play with our wider community, Help us make this show a reality!!Synopsis:  Girls in White Dresses is a lyrical imagining of the final days of four of history's forgotten daughters - Olga, Tatiana, Marie, and Anastasia Romanov. We enter their world of repetition and isolation as they struggle to balance their royal obligations and their personal desires. The play explores their slaughtered potential and how young women all over the world, throughout multiple histories, are denied opportunity and the freedom to pursue opportunity. Through movement, poetry and music we watch four young sisters face their certain end with as much curiosity and courage as they can. Four of the Twin Cities' most engaging and creative actresses of color create an ensemble seldom seen on stage and lend their talents to a story about what it means to be an afterthought - a sister - a daughter - a woman. A lil' history: We, Cristina and Katherine, were connected by Jeremy Cohen (Artistic Director of the Playwrights' Center here in Minneapolis) in January and quickly bonded over a shared vision for what new work in the Twin Cities could look like--specifically, more like us! We are interested in telling stories that  focus on women, reclamation of histories and heritage of people of color, and are visually compelling.One day in early Spring we sat down at Glam Doll Donuts and applied for 2 opportunities: the highly competitive residency at New Works Lab Stratford in Connecticut, and the ArtsNest ""Fledgling"" program here in Minneapolis.

Articulating the stories of queer bodies in history gives us a connection to a past that has been violently erased. My America is a queer America, as difficult and uneven and problematic as that may have been. I want to be able to show that to an audience.
Of course, as my annoying former coworkers reminded me, ""the whole trans thing is very hot right now."" This is the moment to tell this story. Your contribution lets this come to life now, when we need it. This is my first screenplay, but my work as a writer (my whole life, culminating in several poetry publications including a full-length book last year) and my work as a performer (acting with groups like Sacred Circle Theatre Company and Threadbare Theatre Workshop) have been longing to come together. I am thrilled and grateful that i finally have a full-fledged concept, a story i can tell. I just need a little bit of resource to get it into the world. This has been a whirlwind for me-- the characters started coming together in April, and in May i heard about the opportunity to do a reading at the Tank. It was a strange ""yes"" to say, but it came to me loud and clear.    Risks & Challenges

My name is <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/individuals/14280023/edit#/profile"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Danielle Russo</a>. I am a choreographer, director and dancer based in New York City.

<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">WHAT I DO:</span><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;""> </span>
</h3>
<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><p><a href=""http://www.daniellerussoperformanceproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Danielle Russo Performance Project (DRPP)</a> is a network of movement-based artists that design conceptual performances for unconventional formats and spaces. Although its primary medium is dance, the result is always multi-disciplinary and non-conformist. Its productions breathe between public spaces with the intent of engaging an evolving, indiscriminate audience. </p>
<p>As its artistic director, my responsibility is both the choreography and the wholistic experience. I create magnified, immersive environments that feed off sensory stimulation and its awakening of the familiar. I have installed intimate performances in surreal environmental conditions either amplified or augmented by my own doing: parlors flooded by 450,000 white roses, cement pillars suspending bodies with industrial cellophane, foyers recarpeted in inexhaustible bubble wrap, the spoon-feeding of German chocolate cake to a string of strangers, so on and so forth. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p></span></div>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">WHY I AM HERE:</span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i><a href=""http://www.drpp.nyc/salome"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Salome, and the anatomy of invisible corners</a></i> is an intimate, site-specific dance theater production buried in the guts of an abandoned pool on <a href=""https://govisland.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Governors Island's South Battery</a>, contemplating obedience, ritual and the ritual body. Audience members will be invited to witness the performance from above at ground level or by entering into the shallow end of the pool. </span></h3>
<p></p>
<p><i>Salome...</i> is a two-part project in collaboration with filmmaker Luke Ohlson.  In addition to its live public performances, time spent on Governors Island will be documented into a full-length film for future screening and projection mapping into vacant pool spaces.</p>
<p>There will be<b> 3 FREE PUBLIC PERFORMANCES: JUNE 18, 19 and 25. </b>All on-site rehearsals June 13 - 26 will be free and accessible to the public, as well. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">WHERE I WILL BE:</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>In 2003, Governors Island was transferred to both the National Park Service and The City of New York, leading to the creation of The Trust for Governors Island. The Trust has not only preserved but evolved its historic property into an open public space, as well as an educational and artistic laboratory.   </p>
<p></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/25/arts/design/more-public-art-for-governors-island.html?_r=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">OpenHouseGI</a>, a program created by the Trust for Governors Island, provides 150,000 square feet of indoor space and over 20 acres of outdoor space free of charge to organizations that create programming that is free and open to the public. This unrestricted and unparalleled approach has provided the city’s artistic communities with a much needed venue for experimentation, as well as a chance for all creators and programming groups to connect with a extraordinary, diverse public.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>HOW DRPP WILL BENEFIT:</h3>
<p><b>COMMUNITY</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Governors Island is a summertime home for the residents of New York City’s five boroughs + its influx of international tourists. The ranging age, cultural, social and political demographic of its audience is truly unique. A <i>Community Conversation</i> will follow our final performance, with the hope of facilitating a direct dialogue between the creative team and the public. </li></ul>
<p><b>AUDIENCE DEVELOPMENT</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>In 2015, Governors Island welcomed approximately 450,000 visitors in its 120-day season! Nearly 16,000 visitors averaged per weekend. This season will be its first to offer public access to the entire historic district + 30 acres of parkland. We can safely expect at least <b>32,000 visitors</b> on The Island during our two-weekend event! Honestly, I cannot think of another way in which I could have my work so readily accessible to such an enormous and diverse audience. An audience gives purpose to the work, and it is crucial for the work to reach beyond the immediate professional dance community. </li></ul>
<p><b>PROFESSIONAL GROWTH</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Salome...</i> will appear alongside prominent international performance artists such as Eiko Otake. This is a tremendous honor.  <br/>
</li>
<li>It is my mission to nurture DRPP into a sustainable organization that consistently compensates both its performers and multi-disciplinary collaborators.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4></h4>
<h3></h3>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b><br/></b></h2>
<h2><b>However, organizations must fund their own programs as The Trust has no programming budget. </b></h2>
<p>Although free performances are wonderful from a community and development perspective, <b>no ticket sales = no income</b>. </p>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
</div><div>
<h1>My $6000 fundraising goal is to simply cover my artists' wages. </h1>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I believe that it is critically important for an artist to be paid for her/his work. All too often, this is not the case.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Additionally, the infrastructure of most funding systems do not cooperate with project timelines as dictated by submission deadlines for presenting organizations and venues. Nor do they offer much financial aid for the necessary process leading up to production. It can be near impossible for the self-made artist to garner organizational support for her/his small to medium-sized company. I have put together an all-star creative team for this event: Jason Collins (performer), Joanna DeFelice (set designer), Jenny Lai (costume designer) Ingrid Kapteyn (performer) and Luke Ohlson (filmmaker). The production of <i>Salome...</i> on Governors Island will be the culmination of a <b>1-year process</b>. Presently, they have invested: <b>11 months = 132 rehearsals = 948 work hours!</b>

I have installed intimate performances in surreal environmental conditions either amplified or augmented by my own doing: parlors flooded by 450,000 white roses, cement pillars suspending bodies with industrial cellophane, foyers recarpeted in inexhaustible bubble wrap, the spoon-feeding of German chocolate cake to a string of strangers, so on and so forth. 

WHY I AM HERE:
Salome, and the anatomy of invisible corners is an intimate, site-specific dance theater production buried in the guts of an abandoned pool on Governors Island's South Battery, contemplating obedience, ritual and the ritual body. Audience members will be invited to witness the performance from above at ground level or by entering into the shallow end of the pool. 

Salome... is a two-part project in collaboration with filmmaker Luke Ohlson.  In addition to its live public performances, time spent on Governors Island will be documented into a full-length film for future screening and projection mapping into vacant pool spaces.
There will be 3 FREE PUBLIC PERFORMANCES: JUNE 18, 19 and 25. All on-site rehearsals June 13 - 26 will be free and accessible to the public, as well. 

WHERE I WILL BE:

In 2003, Governors Island was transferred to both the National Park Service and The City of New York, leading to the creation of The Trust for Governors Island. The Trust has not only preserved but evolved its historic property into an open public space, as well as an educational and artistic laboratory.   

OpenHouseGI, a program created by the Trust for Governors Island, provides 150,000 square feet of indoor space and over 20 acres of outdoor space free of charge to organizations that create programming that is free and open to the public. This unrestricted and unparalleled approach has provided the city’s artistic communities with a much needed venue for experimentation, as well as a chance for all creators and programming groups to connect with a extraordinary, diverse public.
 
HOW DRPP WILL BENEFIT:
COMMUNITY

Governors Island is a summertime home for the residents of New York City’s five boroughs + its influx of international tourists. The ranging age, cultural, social and political demographic of its audience is truly unique. A Community Conversation will follow our final performance, with the hope of facilitating a direct dialogue between the creative team and the public. 
AUDIENCE DEVELOPMENT

In 2015, Governors Island welcomed approximately 450,000 visitors in its 120-day season! Nearly 16,000 visitors averaged per weekend. This season will be its first to offer public access to the entire historic district + 30 acres of parkland. We can safely expect at least 32,000 visitors on The Island during our two-weekend event! Honestly, I cannot think of another way in which I could have my work so readily accessible to such an enormous and diverse audience. An audience gives purpose to the work, and it is crucial for the work to reach beyond the immediate professional dance community. 
PROFESSIONAL GROWTH



Salome... will appear alongside prominent international performance artists such as Eiko Otake. This is a tremendous honor.  

It is my mission to nurture DRPP into a sustainable organization that consistently compensates both its performers and multi-disciplinary collaborators.






However, organizations must fund their own programs as The Trust has no programming budget. 
Although free performances are wonderful from a community and development perspective, no ticket sales = no income. 



My $6000 fundraising goal is to simply cover my artists' wages. 


I believe that it is critically important for an artist to be paid for her/his work. All too often, this is not the case.

Additionally, the infrastructure of most funding systems do not cooperate with project timelines as dictated by submission deadlines for presenting organizations and venues. Nor do they offer much financial aid for the necessary process leading up to production. It can be near impossible for the self-made artist to garner organizational support for her/his small to medium-sized company. I have put together an all-star creative team for this event: Jason Collins (performer), Joanna DeFelice (set designer), Jenny Lai (costume designer) Ingrid Kapteyn (performer) and Luke Ohlson (filmmaker). The production of Salome... on Governors Island will be the culmination of a 1-year process. Presently, they have invested: 11 months = 132 rehearsals = 948 work hours!



WHY I NEED YOUR HELP:
It's been 4 years since I've led a crowdfunding campaign. With your help, I was able to pay my performers for their time and work at Jacob's Pillow in 2012. I'm humbly asking for your help again. 

I have already paid $15,754 out of my own pocket for this project's operational expenses spanning July 2015 - May 2016:

performers' hourly rehearsal wages........................................$10,490

rehearsal space...........................................................................$3,050

liability insurance...........................................................................$400

damages security..........................................................................$500

identification & safety materials..................................................$200

print marketing materials..............................................................$614

costume materials........................................................................$300

1/3 of set materials.......................................................................$200



This campaign will directly support the artists involved during its final 2 weeks of process and production:


2 Performers (hourly rehearsal + performance wages)..........$1,600
1 Filmmaker (1-year stipend)......................................................$1,100
1 Set Designer (1-year stipend)..................................................$1,100
1 Costume Designer (hourly design + creation wage)...............$700
1 Choreographer (1-year stipend)..............................................$1,100


Any additional funding received will help offset:

2 Technicians................................................................................$800

1 Consultant..................................................................................$300

printed programs.........................................................................$400

2/3 of set materials.....................................................................$500

load-in/strike vehicle...................................................................$300

performers' safety and rehearsal gear.......................................$100 





    THE IMPACT: Your donation will be supporting a person; a hard-working, talented, generous and highly professional artist that has wholeheartedly committed to the process of this project without relying on immediate compensation. This is an extraordinary person. Help me pay the members of my creative team for their time, craft and faith in our collaboration. 

    
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP: We greatly appreciate any and all support! If you are interested in contributing to the project by other means, we are seeking assistance with:   vehicle to transport set materials on June 13 and June 27
bluetooth stereo system(s) and/or other large sound system 

...and keeping the buzz buzzing! Help us spread the word about Salome... and this fundraising campaign by sharing this page.Thank you for your time and consideration!Warmly,Danielle*Danielle Russo Performance Project is a non-profit organization 501(c)(3) under Fractured Atlas.

I commenced to do acting in 2007, and now I am in my fifth &amp; final year of studies about to complete my thesis. </p><p>One of my most aspiring dreams is to be able to present my work in other corners of the world. Consequently, whilst I have studied I have been developing various works of art that I wish to present.

I commenced to do acting in 2007, and now I am in my fifth & final year of studies about to complete my thesis. One of my most aspiring dreams is to be able to present my work in other corners of the world. Consequently, whilst I have studied I have been developing various works of art that I wish to present.

<h3>About The Artist</h3>
<p>Olivia Dwyer received her B.A. in Dance and Sociology from the University of Colorado at Boulder under the guidance of artists such as Michelle Ellsworth, Erika Randall, and Donna Mejia. Dwyer has worked with a wide range of artists including Faye Driscoll, Sidra Bell, and Rennie Harris, as well as premiered work nationally at several acclaimed venues and festivals such as Sans Souci Festival of Dance Cinema and Gibney Dance in New York City. As a social justice practitioner, Dwyer is interested in creating work which grapples, complicates, and challenges codified social interaction while adopting an interdisciplinary approach to creating work, blending the world of dance with technology, film, and performance art.</p>
<h3>About The Art</h3>
<p>​<i>On Saying Goodbye: The Leaving </i>is mine + my collaborators first ever evening length work, premiering at Gibney Dance in New York City this upcoming July. This performance is a part of Gibney’s POP series, a program supporting the dance community through subsidized theater rental. This is a once and a lifetime opportunity as it allows us to fully develop ideas that we have only been able to explore in small chucks. This multimedia work involves live webcams, dance and film. As an intersectional piece with many moving pieces, we are so excited to have the opportunity to fully flesh out these ideas in an evening length work. To read more about the piece, see below!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;""><i>On Saying Goodbye: The Leaving </i>explores human agency, leaving, longing, and grieving. We explore performative questions like: what would breaking past the “4th wall” look like? Is there a 5th wall, and where does it “exist”? When do performers become people and people become performers? Why do we keep ourselves stuck in one place for the sole purpose of pleasing an audience? On Saying Goodbye investigates deeper questions too, like: what it is too be an observer, a performer and a human all at once? We explore what it means to leave each other. Not in a metaphorical sense, we don’t have time for metaphor. We must know truth. We must practice for loss. What is it to truly leave? To walk away from someone, you know you’ll never see again? To grieve what’s already gone. Bodies are fleeting. Emotion is fleeting. Every moment is lost and never coming back again. How do we contend with this reality? We attempt to see it all, soak it in, let it go and let it die again and again in attempts to embrace the inevitability of loss and the beauty of now. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Our goal is $7,000! It may seem like a lot, but donating just the price of a ticket to the show, 15-20 dollars, could make a tremendous difference! Your donations are vital to making this amazing project possible! Creating dance costs money, but I believe all artists and dancers should be paid as much or as close to the same fair amount as any other profession. If you believe the same, please consider donating today! Here's what your donations will pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artist Fees<ul><li>What We Need: <strong><i>$3,170</i></strong> to pay 4 dancers, 1 Lighting Designer, and 1 Stage Manager for rehearsals and performances </li></ul>
</li>
<li>Travel and Living Expenses while in New York City <ul><li>What We Need: <i><strong>$1,910 </strong></i>for 5 flights to New York City Roundtrip and Hotel Fees </li></ul>
</li>
<li>Rental Fees at Gibney Dance Center <ul><li>What We Need: <i><strong>$1,920 </strong></i>for venue rental fees </li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donations will not only make it possible to premiere this work, but more importantly make it possible to pay artists and dancers what they deserve. Dance is a physically, emotionally and mentally demanding profession. My collaborators work hard and I am committed to honoring them. </p>
<p>Beyond fair pay, funding this project means creating opportunities not only for myself as a choreographer but for my dancers to gain performance experience in New York City at a renowned and loved venue. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, we truly risk not being able to make this project happen! Please consider donating anything you can to help support this cause! Every penny helps!</p>

<p>In addition to the great friends we've made, and the plays we've enjoyed and brought back here to New York to read and produce, we've also been able to bring over productions we saw in Ireland, most recently ""Eirebrushed,"" which we produced at Downtown Art on E. 4th St. in November, 2016. Yes, THAT, November, 2016, and we found the message of the play to be energizing in a time when many were reeling.</p>
<p>Two years later, we're still learning not to normalize/live in a new normal, and this year's plays are a reflection of their times. From a rude, satirical look at what comes out of the White House, to a story of lives suddenly changed forever by violence, these plays show us (and the world beyond the US) what we're thinking of, what we're doing, and what we both hope for and fear.</p>
<p>We've got a great team, with Barry making his directing debut in Dublin, and Morry providing the sound effects and music that's essential to both these plays.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Welcome to the No Nuts Comedy Tour!</p>

Playing with direct confrontation, a solo dancer searches for enlightenment through cycles of repetition. Infused with strength, emotional intuition, and fierce intellect, she embraces her own demure fragility. She is at moments elusive; we just catch the curve of her spine in profile, the arch of her feet, bend of her knees, her hips rocking back and forth. Her movements, shapes, and the universal space are both foreign and familiar, and flow into an archetype of wholeness. 
This project challenges the individual's relationship to society. Support this film for the new ideas, choreography, cinematography, and music score it brings into the world. Support the film for the artists featured. Support this film for the women involved at the highest levels - director and co-producer, choreographer, dancer, camera operator -  and help change the film world itself.

This film is being shot through Scary Cow, a film incubator in San Francisco. This means our experienced professional crew donates their time and equipment.
ALL money raised will support this production - even if we don't reach our entire goal, we're still filming!
Money raised will offset costs for location rental, insurance, set design, wardrobe, and food for casts and crew during our 12 hour production day.
Meet our team - we have some truly amazing people working on this project...

Venezuelans and students of the tenth semester of Social Communication mention
of Media Arts in the Universidad Católica Andrés Bello.</p>

As we are in the last semester of the career, the
university requires us to make a graduation project to have the title of
licensed. This project is about the production of a ballet based on the story
of Billy Elliot.<br/><p></p><p>The production is an academic
activity that must fulfill different requirements: choreographic montage of the
story, development of scenography, costume design for the staging, and rental
of specialized professionals in lighting and sound. In addition, we have to
provide to our dancers the basic sustenance as food and water, during the
making progress of the play.</p>
<p>Our principal objective is to
present the identity of the man as classical dancer, in spite of the social judgments. In Venezuela, if a boy says that he
wants to be a dancer, he receives criticism and rejections. Although we are in
an advanced century, sexism and taboos are still very present in our society.
And this case is one of them; a dancer can be pigeonholed as homosexual only
for wanting to dedicate and devote his life to dance.</p>
<p>This is why the story of Billy
Elliot works as an example of the situation of Venezuelan dancers. Billy is an
11 year old boy who through his passion for dancing he becomes a professional
ballet dancer, despite the obstacles and prejudices that stands in his way. </p>
<p>This story began with a movie,
later it was taken to the theatre as a musical presented in cities such as
London and New York. In this opportunity, we propose a value-added to the
piece: telling the story through ballet. This way, we offer a space where the
young dancers can be projected, and also have more experience of expressing
themselves in a scenario. So they manage to boost their artistic careers thanks
to be known in the world of dance.</p>
<p>Regrettably, in Venezuela the
dance doesn’t receive the importance that deserves, and mostly is left to one
side because it is not considered as a real job. The dancers don’t have
sufficient spaces to demonstrate their skills and talent. Besides, they can’t
sustain themselves since the dance is not well paid.</p>
<p>Currently, The Venezuelan society
lives a social, political and economic crisis that affects all areas of life.
For us, young people, getting money is so difficult. We must deal with the high
cost of things and the insecurity that surrounds our daily life. In addition, a
half time salary doesn’t generate the necessary income to be able to support
the project by our own. </p>
<p>Although we have the support of
our families, it is difficult for us to afford all the production requirements.
That’s why we are telling our story here, and with your help you will be contributing

Directly influenced by the male archetypes of world history and personal history; David Bowie, Michelangelo's statue of David, David the ex-boyfriend... these girls process their idea of loyalty to these men, but also their rebellion, exploring the space between Father David and Male Suppression.

Daughters of David  will premiere at 22 Boerum Pl, Brooklyn, NY through CRAWL -  a multi-disciplinary, nomadic arts presenting series that fosters and supports creative meetings between artists and audiences. This is GC&DC's 2nd season with CRAWL.

Your generous contribution directly funds these highly acclaimed and successful performing artists. Their emotional commitment  has shaped and molded the beautiful atmosphere that Daughters of David represents. Performances by Elise Ritzel, Alexis Convento, Emily Palmquist, and Kristin Yancy,   The Impact
 
We totally get it! It's extremely hard to give towards an art form, such as dance, with no real preservation skill besides the memory of its existence. 
The funds raised on Indiegogo  will go directly to the women involved, who have made tremendous alterations in their characters and commitments, to share the universal feeling of loving someone who is not worthy of receiving it . The success of this campaign will ensure that the artists have been paid, and afforded the needed rehearsal space and technical fees. GC&DC, like any dance company, is familiar with the drawbacks and challenges of keeping this performing art alive. We have decided to invest our energy into making movement, so you may be moved by our making.  We are excited about this new work, and a big thank you from Grace Courvoisier & Dance Company.

<br/><h3>We are CYPHER!</h3> <p></p>
<p>Young artists who effectively communicate positive messages through the creative arts and mentoring while motivating and inspiring students of all ages.</p>
<p>CYPHER House Productions is currently working towards a non-profit status, but until that is obtained, we have established a core group that provides schools and organizations with high quality arts programs that include dance, music, and the visual arts. One of our main objectives is to communicate life skills and positive messages through multiple artistic platforms. We mentor students to become leaders and mentors themselves.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need:</h3> <p>Our team has grown considerably within the last year, but there are still kids that would like to be part of our program, but can't due to lack of transportation. We hope to be able to reach as many students as possible by providing them with rides to and from practices. Although we do have an active group of supportive parents, we still need help transporting the current students to and from our performances. Owning a van would lighten the load immensely. </p>
<p>Here's where your money will be going:</p> <ul> <li>$35, 000.00 : A new 13 passenger van</li> <li>$6, 000.00: A trailer for transporting our sound and lighting equipment</li>
<li>$1,000.00: towing package</li> <li>$2,000.00: Tax, Title, and License, and additional fees</li>
<li>$2,000.00: Advertisement wrap for van and/or trailer. </li>
<li>$2,000.00: Sound and lighting equipment maintenance and upgrade.  </li>
<li>$2,000.00: Fuel for our trips for about half a year.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Your contribution will:</div>
<ul> <li>Help us to reach and provide mentoring services for more students in and out of our community. </li>

<h3>The Team</h3>
<p><br/><strong>The Stable | Producers</strong><br/>Recognising the challenges in getting new musical theatre work staged, The Stable was established in 2014 to commission, develop and present innovative shows by emerging writers of exceptional talent</p>
<p>The Stable has commissioned 4 new musicals to date. Their work has been featured on BBC Radio 4's Front Row and  The Stable have received a development grant from the Wellcome Trust, enjoyed a successful raise on Equity platform Crowdcube and secured support from ArtsForward to help develop their slate of shows.</p>
<p>For more information please visit <a href=""http://www.thestablemusicals.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.thestablemusicals.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Matt Board | Music &amp; Lyrics</strong><br/>Matt co-wrote the book, music and lyrics to “Austentatious” which was a critical and audience favourite at the Landor Theatre in 2009, a New York Times pick of the 2007 New York Musical Theatre Festival, and has also been produced in Philadelphia and Calgary.  Matt was a finalist in both the 2013 Search For A Twitter Composer competition and the 2014 Stiles and Drewe New Song Award and was commissioned by Comedy Central to write “Friends: The Opera” for a gala performance in London.</p>
<p>Matt’s other work includes music and lyrics for children’s musical “Ella and the Dragophant”, book, music and lyrics for the one-act two-woman musical “Two’s A Crowd”, which featured in the Perfect Pitch New Musicals Festival.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Reina Hardy | Book</strong><br/>Reina is a playwright. Her plays, which usually contain magic and sometimes contain science, have been seen across the US, including at Rorschach Theatre in DC, the Vortex in Austin, and the 2013 NNPN National New Play Showcase. She’s a Michener Fellow, winner of the 2014 KCACTF TYA Prize, finalist for the Terrence McNally Prize and the recipient of an Interact 20/20 Commission. </p>
<p><br/><strong>The Playground Theatre | Venue</strong><br/>The Playground Theatre is a new venue in West London run by Co-Artistic Directors Anthony Biggs and Peter Tate. Their mission is to work with both established and emerging artists in the UK and internationally. The ethos is one of cross-fertilization between different forms and different cultures with the aim of creating work that is bold and imaginative, while fully engaging the rich diversity of the community of which it is a part.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Shaun Kerrison</strong> | Director</p>
<p><strong>Jim Henson</strong> | Musical Supervisor</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Whiteman</strong> | Choreographer</p>
<p><strong>PJ McEvoy</strong> | Designer</p>

<h3>
<br/>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The show uses a live band, and we want to enhance this with chip and pin sampling technology to mimic 1980's gaming soundtracks and give FANATICAL a unique and authentic sound. As well as being INSANELY COOL, the use of this technical innovation is somewhat pioneering in musical theatre where we haven't seen this being done before!</p>
<p>Chiptune is a genre of music composed using the 8-Bit soundchips from the gaming consoles of the 80s and 90s.  It takes the blips and bleeps from our favourite retro video games and ramps that playful, high-energy soundscape all the way up to 11. Chiptune has been a staple of the online composing scene for the past couple of decades but it's rarely been used in musical theatre before.</p>
<p>It's perfect to evoke the geeky world of Fanatical. If we meet our goal we will be able to fully realise the composer Matt's soundscape by providing funds for this technology as well as being able to hire additional band members to make the whole thing sound completely awesome. <br/> </p>

What We Need & What You Get
The show uses a live band, and we want to enhance this with chip and pin sampling technology to mimic 1980's gaming soundtracks and give FANATICAL a unique and authentic sound. As well as being INSANELY COOL, the use of this technical innovation is somewhat pioneering in musical theatre where we haven't seen this being done before!
Chiptune is a genre of music composed using the 8-Bit soundchips from the gaming consoles of the 80s and 90s.  It takes the blips and bleeps from our favourite retro video games and ramps that playful, high-energy soundscape all the way up to 11. Chiptune has been a staple of the online composing scene for the past couple of decades but it's rarely been used in musical theatre before.
It's perfect to evoke the geeky world of Fanatical. If we meet our goal we will be able to fully realise the composer Matt's soundscape by providing funds for this technology as well as being able to hire additional band members to make the whole thing sound completely awesome.

drug addicts, thieves and mad folk who help give us the modern world. From
drinking mercury to electrocuting elephants for a crowd, Kyle Allatt brings his NO Bull$#!% approach to the story
of human invention. </p>
<p>We’ve got 8 shows in Montreal in the <b>St. Ambroise Montreal
Fringe Festival </b>this year, and more in
the<b> Toronto Fringe Festiva</b>l as well.  Kyle's previous hit show “<b>The NO Bull$#!% History of Canada</b>” has delighted audiences from Montreal to the Maritimes, and
had a Sold out a run at the Edmonton Fringe Festival 2015. </p>
<p>We’re looking for funding to grow and
spread this show. The more successful we are funding the show here, the
more we can advertise and spread this show. After the initial run of The No Bull$#!% History of Canada, Kyle was able to tour to Charlottetown, St.John, Halfiax and then on to Edmonton in 2015. If we hit our goal here we can try to mirror
and exceed that success.  This ups the
likelihood we’ll be able to come to your town, or do a show you can get to experience

<p><b>NO BS: this is what we need &amp; what we can get you</b></p>
<p>Ok so no bull$#!%, we need money to offset the cost of 2

<p>Theater St.Catherine's fees: 500.00</p>
<p>Printing flyers posters, promo video, Sandwich board: 250.00</p>
<p>Whoa Jay, (Kyle's producer and friend) your math doesn’t add
up. If you need 2120.00 why are you only asking for 1500.00?  Well here’s the deal 1. We need to hit our
goals here to Maximize funding. Feel free to give more, we can and will accept
if we meet and exceed our goal. All of these funds go into making the show, and
pushing the show out with the highest quality to most people, so we’re
no-profit. Your money will be well spent. 2.  We are looking to offset the costs we’ve
already incurred, if we don’t make our goal the show will go on, its further
show and improving the media coverage and quality of the props that are dependent

<p></p>
<p>After another
amazing season, with amazing work onstage, with amazing audiences, who were in
turn….amazed in 2015, What Dreams May Co in partnership with Queens Shakespeare
Inc. again turns the microscope onto two of literature’s most famous
characters, who on the surface appear to be complete opposites. One a certain boy
who will never grow up, the other one of Shakespeare’s kings who has grown
quite old. Yet they both seem to suffer a clear case of “Peter Pan Syndrome”;
flying about from place to place, and oblivious to the destruction they leave
in their wake. Following up our successful run
of <i>The Terrible Tragedy of Peter Pan</i>,
What Dreams May Co is pleased to present William Shakespeare’s<i> King Lear</i>.</p>
<p>Director Emily C.A. Snyder brings audiences to the last days of
Imperial Russia, a world of encroaching cold and darkness, of blowing winds,
and crashing thunder. A place where class distinctions are brutally enforced,
in the ever shifting battle to keep from being…left out in the cold. Exploring
this timeless work through this high stakes lens, with a female Lear played by
Kitty Mortland, audiences will be left to discover their own reason in madness,
find the wisdom in folly, and perhaps…see a bit of their own nature in the
shadow of Lear’s looking glass. </p>

<h3>Who We Are </h3>
<p>My name is Jordan Klomp, a young LA-Based actor and teaching artist. Together with co-producer Bo Powell, director Frank Weidner, and a team of friends and fellow artists who are among LA's best, I am independently producing an intimate and compelling iteration of Shakespeare's <i>Cymbeline</i>. Our show premieres this November at the Whitmore-Lindley Theatre in North Hollywood, and runs weekends from November 4-20th.</p>
<p><i>Cymbeline</i> has always held a special place in my heart for its rich characters, complexity of language, and compelling storyline. The fact that several of its themes have such modern-day relevance makes now as poignant a time as any for <i>Cymbeline's</i> retelling. What really makes this production special, though, is the collective of incredibly talented artists who have banded together to work on it. Your contributions will guarantee that every member of this fantastic team receives compensation for the  hours of time and huge amounts of creative energy they have poured into this project. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>To help amply stipend the artists and cover our production costs, we need $5000.</li>
<li>Signed Posters, a glass of wine, free tickets, a personalized sonnet...even an Elizabethan Feast held in your name! Visit our ""Perks"" page for more details!</li>
<li>While we would love to reach our goal, every little bit goes a long way to paying the cast and crew! The more you donate, the more likely it is that this will be able to afford to reunite for more great theatre!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Helping our team afford some money for gas, or helping to recompense them for the hours of work they have taken off to be a part of this is important. Just as important is the support your donation will give towards this unforgettable project, the likes of which is rarely seen in the intimate LA Theatre Scene. </p>
<ul>
<li>We are an ensemble hailing from some of the best Theatres in Los Angeles, Including Theatricum Botanicum, A Noise Within, Antaeus, Rogue Machine, Sacred Fools, and Center Theatre Group.</li>
<li>Our goal with this project is to bring some big theatre talent to a wider audience. Tickets are only $10-$20, meaning more people can afford to see our production than those of larger theaters. </li>
<li>We are also using this affordability of pricing to have our show reach schools and students. Many of our ensemble members are teachers, and educating/inspiring the next generation of students and artists is something we are extremely passionate about!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As a self-produced show with a newly formed core, we don't yet possess the audience of an established company, and aren't eligible for grants or funding from commercial sources. This is why we need YOU! </p>
<ul>
<li>Part of our choice in self-producing is in allowing for the inclusion of Equity Actors in our ensemble on a completely volunteer basis. This means a higher quality ensemble and performance!</li>
<li>In addition, we are not constricted in what we can stipend our actors and crew like a Theatre company would be. The more you donate, the more our team will earn for their efforts, and the more we can give back artistically to our community!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>As an artist, I understand that sometimes, there is just no extra money available to donate to a project. There are many other ways you can help support us though, including: </p>

<li>Purchasing a ticket to our show! Tickets are available on <a href=""http://cymbelinela.brownpapertickets.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://cymbelinela.brownpapertickets.com</a> . You can even type in ""Mountaineer"" for a $10 ticket!</li>

<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>My name is Nova Grayson Casillo, and producing <i>Dracula </i>will be my thesis for my degree in Design and Technical Theatre.  I will be designing the props, scenery, lighting, and costumes for the production. This production will be a culminating point for me - allowing me to explore the areas of technical theatre for which I have the most passion.</p>
<p>Dracula interests me for a number of reasons, the first being the subject matter. I am drawn to plays which are dark and contain elements of horror. </p>
<p>The challenges in this specific adaptation of Dracula include sudden scene changes and stunning technical surprises. Balancing the intimacy of the story with the spectacle is key. There are also a few props which are of particular interest: a live rat is eaten on stage and a blood transfusion takes place.</p>
<p>The technical aspects of this story are also showcased more than those in a typical production. Unlike previous productions I have designed, where the tech is successful when it goes unnoticed, the special effects and production elements are crucial to the plot moving forward.</p>
<div>
<h3>Meet the Director:</h3>
<p>Rebekah Reimer graduated from Belmont University in Nashville, TN in 2013. She has directed several shows, but is uniquely qualified for this production through her additional technical experience as a designer, technician, and technical director.  She is drawn to shows which require technical prowess, and <i>Dracula</i> has been on her list to direct for quite some time. To learn more about Rebekah, you can visit her <a href=""http://www.bekahreimer.com/Welcome.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h3>
<p>Producing this show will be challenging and incredibly risky. That is why we have chosen it. Although implementing the show will be no easy feat, our largest obstacle is in funding.  If we are unable to reach our goal in funding, we will still be able to do the production - but the challenges in creating the spectacle we hope for will be magnified. </p>

<p>Hello Friend!</p>
<p><strong>WE ARE TAKING LENA OFF-BROADWAY!!!</strong><br/>But, in order to accomplish this, we must produce a presentation ( It's more like a fancy audition) for theatrical investors and theatrical houses. If these folks like what they see, the next steps involve them producing our little skit (fingers crossed) in their theater.The presentation will be held in NYC at the decadent Duane Park, NYC. We have invited renowned theaters in New York City, to potentially become our new home. </p>
<p>How Much?</p>
<p><br/>The total cost of the presentation is $7,500<br/> </p>
<p><strong>HOW IS THE MONEY SPENT?</strong><br/>With a bit of magic and miracles, we are going to WOW these folks. But, putting on a show can be costly. Why? Because unfortunately, we can't ask world class musicians, management, dramaturg, director, stage managers, cast and stage crew to be paid in hugs and high-fives. Your contributions go to them!</p>
<p>Cast Rehearsals </p>
<p>The Team will work A LOT in a little amount of time. </p>
<p>We will have production meetings from now until showtime. <br/><br/><strong>WHY Do This Now?</strong><br/>Who Runs The World? Women! - Our world is finally beginning to recognize women as the most influential beings on the earth. Lena Horne was there as a woman, specifically a woman of color. She broke down racial barriers, kicked down doors, and forged a path for many Black female artists to follow.  It's time to tell her story.<br/><br/>We at #TeamLena are excited to share this journey with you. We are grateful for your love and support in making this presentation a reality. I'm a believer in the strength of community, and together we can do it! And when we go to Broadway,YOU can say, you helped us get there!<br/><br/><strong>ABOUT</strong></p>
<p><u><strong>LENA: A Moment With A Lady</strong></u><br/><br/>As we approach the centennial of her birth, Lena Horne’s legacy lives on as we are transported back in time to remember, relate and relish with the one and only. Set in 1981, Lena, played by Syndee Winters (Lion King, Pippin, Hamilton) constructs a narrative through words and music of some of her most pivotal personal and professional moments, which made her the multifarious women we all have come to love. On a mission to share the truth and overcome adversity, she unexpectedly opens crevices that she has eluded for many years.<br/><br/>She’s recognized as of the most influential African-American pioneers in entertainment. Ms. Horne collaborated with some of greatest musical artists of the 20th century, shattered the color barrier in Hollywood, and she was heavily involved with the civil rights movement. Lena Horne is not only recognized as a timeless beauty, inside and out, but she is cherished as an American Icon. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Voyeur Theatre Collective is committed to exploring the evolution of theatre for the millennial generation by changing the makeup of the social art form to reflect the changing demographics and interests of its audience. A VTC show is part party, part performance—celebratory, immersive, digital, completely original and unflinchingly intimate.</p> <p>Our tight-knit collective consists of a diverse array of artists, allowing our performances to utilize everything from live DJs and video projection to choreographed movement and audience interaction. Culture evolves, and we do too.</p>
<p><br/>Voyeur Theatre Collective’s spring show is Next Level. It follows five players as they navigate a party depicted as a video game, with accomplishments to unlock and other “non-playable characters” (NPCs) to battle. The show explores existentialist concepts by assigning enhanced meaning to social events and interpersonal interactions, raising the stakes of everyday life. Just as millennials are able to choose to interact with the world or stay at home on Netflix, audience members can choose to observe or actively participate in the show. The show will feature live musical performances, video projections, dance and choreographed movement and an original score.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Voyeur Theatre Collective is only three years old, and does not receive funding from Northwestern University. While we have held fundraisers throughout the year, we are ultimately financially dependent on this Indiegogo page. Our shows are rooted in core tenants of the millennial existence like technology and live music, and thus require a substantial budget.</p>
<p>The three primary costs for this show are renting a performance space, constructing a set with several high-powered projectors and renting a full sound system. We also plan on attracting a non-traditional theatre audience with low ticket prices, and thus need to subsidize that cost.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When you generously donate to Voyeur Theatre Collective’s spring performance, you allow us to change the way our generation uses art to understand ourselves and the world. VTC’s core ethos of uniting creative people from a diverse array of disciplines and backgrounds demonstrates our commitment to unifying through theatre. Help us create immersive, intimate, urgently relevant theatre.</p>
