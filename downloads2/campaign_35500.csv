We are doing everything we can to help support our community and begin eradicating homelessness within it! We're partnering up with a local nonprofit called Coming Home, an organization that works towards getting homeless people off the streets and into long-term living arrangements, and have decided to donate our proceeds to them.

We believe that families <b>shouldn't have to wait</b> to be helped until they are shaped into a certain mold.

<div>My Story</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My name is Abigail Del Vecchio, and I am a 26 year old student currently a student at the Honors College at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona.  I am studying Political Science with a specialization in Foreign Affairs as my major, in addition to two minors: Spanish and Marketing. My dream is to run my own non-profit organization working with state and non-state actors to promote and facilitate world peace and to create peaceful solutions to global problems.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I served in the United States Marine Corps for 3 1/2 years, and deployed to Iraq in 2008 as an individual augment to four different infantry units as part of The Lioness Program. During this deployment, I assisted various Marine Corps infantry units throughout Iraq in their mission to train Iraqi police and secure entry control check points to the major cities. I was also given the opportunity assist in US-funded free medical care events for Iraqi women and children. This deployment changed my life  and my perspective. My time overseas and time in the Marine Corps has inspired me to pursue an education in politics, diplomacy, and negotiation strategies.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Under normal circumstances, I would be receiving my GI Bill to help pay for tuition and living costs.  Unfortunately, I do not qualify for the GI Bill because I was discharged under Other Than Honorable conditions six months before my four-year contract expired.

He happened to be an officer in my unit.  We fell in love, even though we knew that our relationship was considered to be fraternization.  Our chain of command found out that we were together, and determined that our actions were grounds for immediate separation. To this day, my fiancee (John) and I are still deeply in love and would have done it all over again if given the chance. He is currently teaching high school math, and making a difference in each of his student's lives. However, our decision to be together while in the Marine Corps has resulted in some financial hardship. John is obligated to repay the government for his Naval Academy tuition.  I am relying on financial aid, savings, and a full-time waitressing job to fund the remainder of my education. I am more determined than ever to complete my education with honors, and to make a positive difference in the world alongside my fiancee.</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Am Asking For &amp; What You Get</h3>
I started this campaign to help me raise enough money to volunteer and study abroad in Guatemala. In addition to completing the requirements for my Spanish minor, a semester in Guatemala will solidify my understanding of the Latin culture and fluency in the Spanish language. This will be invaluable when I begin my career in International Relations. I know that a semester in Cental America will complement my experiences abroad in the Marine Corps and further broaden my perspectives.  In addition to taking Spanish and Political Science courses in Antigua, Guatemala, I will also be volunteering my free time to the local elementary schools and hospitals. I have researched volunteer opportunities for American students, and have already started applying for a part-time position as a teaching assistant.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My goal is to raise $5,500 to pay for my tuition, travel, and miscellaneous expenses. Any funds I receive above and beyond my goal will be donated to reputable charities and hospitals in Antigua. Your contribution will not only fund my education and personal enrichment, but you will also be sponsoring any volunteer work I will be participating in. I am passionate about spreading knowledge and education, and making a positive difference in people's lives whether it is here in America or abroad. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping me to achieve my dream of making the world a better place to live.</div>
<p>I am beyond grateful for any contribution toward my goal. Contributions of $50 or more will receive a personal thank-you note sent from Guatemala along with a picture of me with my host family. Contributions of $100 or more will also receive a personal thank-you note from me while I am in Guatemala, pictures from my travels, and a DVD copy of the video diary I will be keeping during my studies and volunteer work. In addition to these incentives, If I exceed my goal, I will donate to a local charity in your name if you donate over $200. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my story. I can't begin to express how grateful I am to you for your participation in my education. My promise to you is that I will make every dollar count, and that your contribution is an investment in the future of the Earth.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<div>
<p>If you can't contribute, but still want to help, there are other ways you can make a huge difference in helping me achieve my goal.  One way you could help is to get the word out to as many people as you can. You can share the link to my campaign on your social media page, email your friends and family, or tell your boss or co-workers. Any effort or contribution to help me, no matter how small, will make a significant impact not only in my life but in the lives of those who I meet and befriend in Guatemala.</p>

<p>We are TEDxColumbiaCollege, a group of Columbia University students. We are a licensed TEDx organizer and are organizing a TED style event for the Columbia community, which will take place on November 3rd, 2012. </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>What is TED?</strong></span> </p>
<p>TED is an acronym that stands for Technology, Entertainment, and Design. Owned by the Sapling Foundation, TED seeks to promote “ideas worth spreading” through a set of conferences. Topics in the conferences are just as bold and creative as the themes that produce them, and TED conferences have hosted such notable speakers as Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Richard Dawkins, Bill Gates and Majora Carter. The conferences, whose videos we are sure you have encountered, are a forum for academic and intellectual inspiration, but moreover, they are a tool to engender change. Their website can be accessed at <strong>TED.com</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What is TEDx?</span></strong> </p>
<p><strong>x</strong> = independently organized event.<br/>TEDx was created in the spirit of TED's mission. By licensing third parties, the TEDx program gives communities, organizations and individuals the opportunity to stimulate dialogue through TED-like experiences at a local level. At TEDx events, a screening of TEDTalks videos -- or a combination of live presenters and TEDTalks videos -- sparks deep conversation and connections. TEDx events are fully planned and coordinated independently, on a community-by-community basis.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Theme</span></strong></p>
<p>The theme we have decided on is inspired by a Dr. Seuss poem:</p>
<p>“My alphabet starts with this letter called yuzz. It’s the letter I use to spell yuzza ma tuzz. You’ll be sort of surprised what there is to be found When you go beyond Z and start poking around. So go <strong>beyond Z!</strong></p>
<p>It's high time you were shown That you really don't know All there is to be known.”</p>
<p>-- Dr. Seuss</p>
<p><strong>“Beyond Z”</strong>-- Light, youthful, humbling, innovative, creative, this theme encourages moving beyond what we have taken for granted; “to boldly go.” We want to explore how a <em>lack </em>of knowledge is a tool of discovery, and indeed, a crucial and necessary one. By acknowledging that we ""really don't know all there is to be known,"" we hope to re-frame the idea of ‘not knowing’ not as failure or inadequacy, but as a path to exposure to new perspectives. We wish to embrace curiosity and to encourage openness to ideas that are ""beyond Z,"" beyond our own preconceived notions of what our ""alphabet"" is limited to.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The impact of your contribution</span></strong></p>
<p>The fundamental goal of <strong>TED</strong>x<strong>ColumbiaCollege </strong>would be to foster and share great ideas. Nothing more, nothing less. It will be an opportunity to inspire, to motivate, and to impart knowledge. It will be a chance to showcase the brilliance and variety present on the Columbia campus and the plethora of incredible ideas that are born out of the Columbia community.</p>
<p>By the end of the TEDx conference, we hope to have imparted a questioning spirit to our audience. We want them to critically examine the “alphabet” of the world around them and to “poke around” to find new ideas, world views, experiences and form their <em>own </em>opinions about them.   </p>
<p>Your contributions will be vital for the event as they will allow us to acquire:</p>

<p>Hello! we are a group of teenagers between fifteen and sixteen years of age. We live in Ecuador and study at a private school. We are a close group of friends who like to do lots of fun things together,  and now we have started a project to help people in need. Although we personally have a high standard of living, there are people who live in a very substandard level. Ecuador is an underdeveloped country, so situations like these are pretty common. After searching for rural towns on the outskirts of our city, we finally found a place located an hour away in the countryside WHERE THERE IS NO where there is no basicplumbing or electricity. There is a school at this particular location, a very poor one. It does not receive any help from the government, therefore, the level of education is not good either. Approximately 50 children study in 1 classroom where are deteriorating, there is no bathrooms, and there is no roof, so when it rains classes have to be cancelled. Children get to school by foot (it takes 1 hour) or by riding a donkey (it takes 30 minutes). As we said there are no basic services in this school, which means no water and no electricity.</p>
<p><strong>Our Goal</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to demolish the existing room and build two or three new classrooms, with durable materials that will be water resistant. We also want to build a good roof, so the rain won’t interfere with their education. We also want to build a bathroom in the back of the school as this is a very basic necessity.  Aside of building the 3 new classrooms and bathroom, we also want to equip the school with desks, chairs, books and material to work with.</p>
<p>It all started as a simple project to satisfy our own need to help others, but after interacting with the children our goal is to help their not-so-easy life become full of hope and to encourage them to continue fighting to succeed no matter the circumstances that surround them.</p>
<p>In the beginning we were contributing with money obtained from yard sales and from our own pockets, but their needs are so large that now we are asking for your help to continue improving their quality of life. </p>
<p>We have already started building the classroom and the foundation for the bathroom, in order to finish these projects we need your donations. The next area we also want to improve is the recreation / game area.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Hello! We are a small group of dedicated volunteers spending the summer in Ghana to serve thousands of vulnerable children. In partnership with the Ghanaian Department of Social Welfare (DSW), we will be assisting in a government initiative to improve the lives of orphans and vulnerable children.

Hello! We are a small group of dedicated volunteers spending the summer in Ghana to serve thousands of vulnerable children. In partnership with the Ghanaian Department of Social Welfare (DSW), we will be assisting in a government initiative to improve the lives of orphans and vulnerable children. This work will result in the DSW matching children with homes and families that will provide the best mental, emotional, and physical care for them. But, we need your help to get there!
Our costs include airfare, housing and transportation, and vaccinations. Our funding goal would cover our housing and transportation. However, if you are interested in further supporting our work, please consider donating a bit more so we can meet our other costs. Every dollar will move this meaningful service forward. For more detailed information about our mission, the interns, the organization, and our costs please read on.

<b>OUR PROJECT</b><br/>
<p><b><i>Please help CO-SOUND build the cooperative movement in the Pacific Northwest by supporting three members of local cooperatives to travel to Venezuela this summer to work with CECOSESOLA in Barquisimeto, Venezuela.</i></b></p>
<p> In the fall of 2015, you helped us realize the first half of our 
exchange project by bringing 4 members of CECOSESOLA to Olympia, Washington. Our <i>compañeros </i>and <i>compañeras</i>  from CECOSESOLA stayed in our homes and 
volunteered at our  local cooperatives.<b> </b><i><b>Thanks to your support we deepened our relationships and affirmed our mutual commitment to building a sustainable network of cooperatives and organizations focused on economic self-determination and social justice</b>. </i><br/></p>
<p>Now we are planning to complete the exchange by sending 3 members of our regional cooperative network for 5 weeks to volunteer in one of CECOSESOLA's many cooperative ventures. Our participants will live with a member family and deepen their knowledge about cooperative culture and economics, consensus decision-making, and more.</p>
<p>So far we have raised over $3,000 from local organizations. While our exchange participants are also fundraising, we intend to raise at least half of the costs of their trip. <b><i>No one we've accepted will be turned away for lack of funds.</i></b> <br/></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise an additional $2,000 to over the cost of air fare, living expenses, and other costs, including a visit to the Venezuelan Consulate in San Francisco to apply in person for visas<i>.</i> </p>
<p><b>WHAT is CECOSESOLA?</b></p>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p>CECOSESOLA is one of the largest and most
successful cooperatives in the world. It is a 50+ year old<b> </b>cooperative and network of cooperatives, with over 20,000 members, 1,600 workers (<i>socios) </i>and
 80 different organizations represented. Services provided by CECOSESOLA
 include: a hospital, funeral <b> </b>services, a lending agency, an appliance purchasing cooperative<b>, </b>farms, food processors, and 
three large food markets, or ferias<b>, </b>all of which provide 
quality services for low income and working class people at below 
average cost. The organization is non-hierarchical; members
practice job rotation and make decisions by consensus. New cooperative projects
are decided upon by the group as a whole and respond to needs in the broader
community. <br/></p>
<p> CECOSESOLA is a living demonstration of how working people can create 
alternatives to capitalist exploitation, develop a culture which 
supports the development and growth of each member and build an economy 
which serves the needs of their communities. <br/></p>

<p>I have been doing cooperative
and collective work since I moved to Olympia in 2012, beginning as a worker
at the <span>student-run Flaming
Eggplant Cooperative Cafe at the Evergreen State College. My studies
concentrated in political economy, community outreach and cooperative
development. In my last year at
the college I began to prepare for a career working with cooperatives by
studying accounting. Currently, I works at the Northwest
Construction Cooperative as a bookkeeper and collective policy specialist. I am inspired by the way CECOSESOLA members come together to holistically address the issues faced by themselves and their community through creating a cooperative economy, and incorporating mutual aid into every facet of their development strategy."" Working at CECOSESOLA would be a dream opportunity to learn about large-scale
consensus decision-making, cooperative networking, and community work in
Barquisimeto - all of which I plan to share and implement with the Olympia
community.</span></p>

<p>I have been a worker at The
Flaming Eggplant Café, a student run café at The Evergreen State College, since
2014. My studies are focused on Latin American literature, political
economy, and cooperative and community organizing in the U.S. and Latin America. I've been reading and researching cooperative movements and organizing 
in communities of color in the U.S. and communities in Latin America. Part of working in cooperatives is always being open to learning from one another and acknowledging that there are many different ways to do things. I am interested in working with and learning from CECOSESOLA because the cooperative movement in Latin America has values that I grew up with, through family. I am excited to continue the work with
CECOSEOLA and keep the connection strong with student run
cooperatives. <br/></p>

<b>Whitney Bard</b><br/>
<p>Originally from Colorado, I've been actively involved in the Cooperative Movement in Olympia for the past
six years. I spent time with the compañero/as from CECOSESOLA when they visited
Olympia this fall, and I am excited to grow the movement through the
connection between our cooperative communities, enabling the sharing of
knowledge and skills. I am deeply devoted to the belief in a cooperative
future, and I understand that communities like Olympia can learn a lot from such
a large, successful and multi-faceted cooperative as CECOSESOLA. I worked at the student-run restaurant at the Evergreen State College, the Flaming Eggplant Cafe, for three years. I was a regional organizer at a student food cooperative development organization, COFED, for one year. I currently work at the Olympia Food Co-op where I cook in the deli
and do outreach and marketing. My favorite pastimes include writing
poetry, exploring forests, trying new foods and gardening.</p>
<b></b><p><b>HISTORY of the EXCHANGE</b></p>
<blockquote>
<b></b><p><b><i>""Unless we 
create an alternative, non-capitalist way of producing and reproducing 
our lives, we cannot go very far. If we think of the forces of 
production, not as technology, in the sense of machines, but as our own 
creative power, then we can say that our ability to change the world 
radically depends not just on our explosions of anger, but also on the 
development of our productive forces, that is, our creative power to do 
things differently.</i>""</b></p>
<p><b>           John Holloway<br/></b></p>
</blockquote>
<b></b>Our relationship with CECOSESOLA dates back to 2012, designated by 
the United Nations as  the ""International Year of the Cooperative."" We 
had been seeking partners to help us deepen our learning about 
cooperatives and especially about how to broaden our cooperative network
 by creating sustainable alternatives to capitalist economic 
enterprises. We requested and got support from the Olympia Food Coop and
 the Evergreen State College to send students and coop members to live 
and work at CECOSESOLA. CECOSESOLA members then came to us in the spring
 and participated in a two-day conference on cooperatives that brought 
over 100 participants from 3 counties. 
<br/><br/><b></b><p>The knowledge and experience gained from our exchange with Cecosesola
 helped create new cooperatives in the Olympia area, including the New 
Moon Cafe and the Northwest Construction Cooperative (NWCC). As Micheal 
Snow, administrative coordinator of the NWCC said, ""CECOSESOLA has been 
instrumental in demonstrating to us, and the rest of the world, that 
cooperatives and cooperativism are a real challenge to capitalism and 
all its defects... without the inspiration and example of CECOSESOLA, I 
sincerely doubt we would be in the place we are today.""</p>WHO ARE WE?<br/>CO-SOUND (South Sound Cooperative Network) is a networking and mutual support organization for cooperatives in our area. We seek to educate our community about cooperative development, and support the formation of new cooperatives. Currently, our organization is comprised of representatives from the Olympia Food Co-op, the New Moon Collective, the Flaming Eggplant Cafe, the Northwest Cooperative Development Center, the Evergreen State College, and the Northwest Construction Cooperative. It also includes business owners and youth advocates from a local school district.<br/>
<br/><p><b>OUR VISION</b><br/></p>
<p>We are committed to building a vibrant, inter-cultural cooperative network in our community that includes  current cooperatives and expands beyond them. We are committed to improving access to the goods and services offered by these organizations and disseminating knowledge about how cooperatives work. We commit to supporting groups seeking economic self-determination through cooperative practice, and to letting social justice and respect for differences guide our work with one another and our community.
</p>
<p><b>OUR MISSION STATEMENT</b></p>
<p>CO-SOUND (South Sound Cooperative Network), a network of cooperative organizations and allies in Washington's South Puget Sound area, promotes community and self-sustainability among cooperatives through popular education, mutual assistance, and social and cultural activities.</p>
<p>We work to increase our own capacity as well as to offer resources for groups organizing for economic self-determination, with a focus on worker-owned and collectively managed workplaces. We work to develop infrastructure to support groups in growing a local and regional cooperative community.</p>
<p><b>COOPERATIVES and SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT<br/></b></p>
<p>As Evergreen State College Professor John Baldridge wrote during the first, 2012 exchange, ""The search for answers...has led to a new resurgence of interest in democratic economic models, including cooperatives...Not only do cooperatives tend to weather economic crises more successfully than traditional businesses, co-ops also help to ensure that the economic benefits of business circulate in the local communities they serve because they are owned and operated by the people who work for them.  And unlike traditional local businesses, where a private owner can hire or fire people at will, cooperatives bring democracy into the workplace, allowing for innovative democratic solutions to economic challenges, which go beyond 'downsizing' or 'selling out.'"" </p>
<p>According to a recent study by the International Organization of Industrial and Service Cooperatives, the world cooperative economy currently generates around $2.2 trillion annually, while 250 million people worldwide are employed or earn their living thanks to a cooperative. With two million workers employed by cooperatives in the U.S., our ooperative economy represents a small but significant percentage of this global movement. Yet many within the U.S. cooperative movement have little knowledge of cooperatives outside the United States.</p>
<p>For decades, CECOSESOLA has welcomed visitors from all over the world, and has engaged in international 
exchanges and education with cooperatives from Egypt, Mexico, France 
and Germany, among others . The 2016 exchange project offers our community the opportunity to learn from and with an organization 
that
incorporates democracy and social justice into its economic practices while flourishing economically. <b>

 include: a hospital, funeral  services, a lending agency, an appliance purchasing cooperative, farms, food processors, and 
three large food markets, or ferias, all of which provide 
quality services for low income and working class people at below 
average cost. The organization is non-hierarchical; members
practice job rotation and make decisions by consensus. New cooperative projects
are decided upon by the group as a whole and respond to needs in the broader
community. 
 CECOSESOLA is a living demonstration of how working people can create 
alternatives to capitalist exploitation, develop a culture which 
supports the development and growth of each member and build an economy 
which serves the needs of their communities. 
WHO IS GOING TO VENEZUELA?


Emma Thomson 



I have been doing cooperative
and collective work since I moved to Olympia in 2012, beginning as a worker
at the student-run Flaming
Eggplant Cooperative Cafe at the Evergreen State College. My studies
concentrated in political economy, community outreach and cooperative
development. In my last year at
the college I began to prepare for a career working with cooperatives by
studying accounting. Currently, I works at the Northwest
Construction Cooperative as a bookkeeper and collective policy specialist. I am inspired by the way CECOSESOLA members come together to holistically address the issues faced by themselves and their community through creating a cooperative economy, and incorporating mutual aid into every facet of their development strategy."" Working at CECOSESOLA would be a dream opportunity to learn about large-scale
consensus decision-making, cooperative networking, and community work in
Barquisimeto - all of which I plan to share and implement with the Olympia
community.



Stéfanie Perez-Gomez

I have been a worker at The
Flaming Eggplant Café, a student run café at The Evergreen State College, since
2014. My studies are focused on Latin American literature, political
economy, and cooperative and community organizing in the U.S. and Latin America. I've been reading and researching cooperative movements and organizing 
in communities of color in the U.S. and communities in Latin America. Part of working in cooperatives is always being open to learning from one another and acknowledging that there are many different ways to do things. I am interested in working with and learning from CECOSESOLA because the cooperative movement in Latin America has values that I grew up with, through family. I am excited to continue the work with
CECOSEOLA and keep the connection strong with student run
cooperatives. 


Whitney Bard
Originally from Colorado, I've been actively involved in the Cooperative Movement in Olympia for the past
six years. I spent time with the compañero/as from CECOSESOLA when they visited
Olympia this fall, and I am excited to grow the movement through the
connection between our cooperative communities, enabling the sharing of
knowledge and skills. I am deeply devoted to the belief in a cooperative
future, and I understand that communities like Olympia can learn a lot from such
a large, successful and multi-faceted cooperative as CECOSESOLA. I worked at the student-run restaurant at the Evergreen State College, the Flaming Eggplant Cafe, for three years. I was a regional organizer at a student food cooperative development organization, COFED, for one year. I currently work at the Olympia Food Co-op where I cook in the deli
and do outreach and marketing. My favorite pastimes include writing
poetry, exploring forests, trying new foods and gardening.
HISTORY of the EXCHANGE

""Unless we 
create an alternative, non-capitalist way of producing and reproducing 
our lives, we cannot go very far. If we think of the forces of 
production, not as technology, in the sense of machines, but as our own 
creative power, then we can say that our ability to change the world 
radically depends not just on our explosions of anger, but also on the 
development of our productive forces, that is, our creative power to do 
things differently.""
           John Holloway

Our relationship with CECOSESOLA dates back to 2012, designated by 
the United Nations as  the ""International Year of the Cooperative."" We 
had been seeking partners to help us deepen our learning about 
cooperatives and especially about how to broaden our cooperative network
 by creating sustainable alternatives to capitalist economic 
enterprises. We requested and got support from the Olympia Food Coop and
 the Evergreen State College to send students and coop members to live 
and work at CECOSESOLA. CECOSESOLA members then came to us in the spring
 and participated in a two-day conference on cooperatives that brought 
over 100 participants from 3 counties. 
The knowledge and experience gained from our exchange with Cecosesola
 helped create new cooperatives in the Olympia area, including the New 
Moon Cafe and the Northwest Construction Cooperative (NWCC). As Micheal 
Snow, administrative coordinator of the NWCC said, ""CECOSESOLA has been 
instrumental in demonstrating to us, and the rest of the world, that 
cooperatives and cooperativism are a real challenge to capitalism and 
all its defects... without the inspiration and example of CECOSESOLA, I 
sincerely doubt we would be in the place we are today.""WHO ARE WE?CO-SOUND (South Sound Cooperative Network) is a networking and mutual support organization for cooperatives in our area. We seek to educate our community about cooperative development, and support the formation of new cooperatives. Currently, our organization is comprised of representatives from the Olympia Food Co-op, the New Moon Collective, the Flaming Eggplant Cafe, the Northwest Cooperative Development Center, the Evergreen State College, and the Northwest Construction Cooperative. It also includes business owners and youth advocates from a local school district.
OUR VISION
We are committed to building a vibrant, inter-cultural cooperative network in our community that includes  current cooperatives and expands beyond them. We are committed to improving access to the goods and services offered by these organizations and disseminating knowledge about how cooperatives work. We commit to supporting groups seeking economic self-determination through cooperative practice, and to letting social justice and respect for differences guide our work with one another and our community.

OUR MISSION STATEMENT
CO-SOUND (South Sound Cooperative Network), a network of cooperative organizations and allies in Washington's South Puget Sound area, promotes community and self-sustainability among cooperatives through popular education, mutual assistance, and social and cultural activities.
We work to increase our own capacity as well as to offer resources for groups organizing for economic self-determination, with a focus on worker-owned and collectively managed workplaces. We work to develop infrastructure to support groups in growing a local and regional cooperative community.
COOPERATIVES and SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
As Evergreen State College Professor John Baldridge wrote during the first, 2012 exchange, ""The search for answers...has led to a new resurgence of interest in democratic economic models, including cooperatives...Not only do cooperatives tend to weather economic crises more successfully than traditional businesses, co-ops also help to ensure that the economic benefits of business circulate in the local communities they serve because they are owned and operated by the people who work for them.  And unlike traditional local businesses, where a private owner can hire or fire people at will, cooperatives bring democracy into the workplace, allowing for innovative democratic solutions to economic challenges, which go beyond 'downsizing' or 'selling out.'"" 
According to a recent study by the International Organization of Industrial and Service Cooperatives, the world cooperative economy currently generates around $2.2 trillion annually, while 250 million people worldwide are employed or earn their living thanks to a cooperative. With two million workers employed by cooperatives in the U.S., our ooperative economy represents a small but significant percentage of this global movement. Yet many within the U.S. cooperative movement have little knowledge of cooperatives outside the United States.
For decades, CECOSESOLA has welcomed visitors from all over the world, and has engaged in international 
exchanges and education with cooperatives from Egypt, Mexico, France 
and Germany, among others . The 2016 exchange project offers our community the opportunity to learn from and with an organization 
that
incorporates democracy and social justice into its economic practices while flourishing economically.

</div></div>","The Story



I have spent the better part of the last ten years traveling
around the world teaching Thai Yoga Massage to small groups of people in radically diverse settings.
What I have noticed is that it doesn’t matter whether I am sharing this ancient
discipline with villagers in rural Tibet, single moms living on the street in
London, an HIV positive group in Chiang Mai, tsunami survivors on the Andaman
Coast, or special needs children in a favela in Rio de Janeiro, the basic
response is the same: language, age, cultural and socioeconomic barriers
dissolve; hearts open; deep, healthy connections are made; and lives are
transformed.

 
The Impact

Sometimes the transformation is subtle. A person might
notice that they are breathing a little deeper, feeling a little calmer, thinking
a little clearer, or better able to make good decisions. It is also common for someone who was initially too shy to look me in the eye to become very animated and eager to communicate. As they share their experience, I notice that the light has returned to their eyes, and I enjoy the broad smile that now decorates their face. 

But sometimes the transformation is
profound. A person who once identified himself or herself as a victim, now
recognizes that they have something valuable to give, and feels inspired and
empowered to help someone else. This type of insight often leads those individuals to incorporate some of their new stress management exercises and massage practices into their relationships with family members, especially their children, thus breaking the cycle of violence and/or neglect that they grew up with. Others resonate so deeply with the experience that they choose to pursue a career in the healing arts. When an individual makes this choice they are not only generating a valuable resource and ray of light in their community, they are often actively taking a significant step away from ending up in a more common default trade such as prostitution. 

Everything that I have seen, heard and experienced through these simple exchanges has indicated to me that the impact of creating a safe space for individuals to explore the relationship between mind and body, breath and movement, and self and other, within the framework of Thai Yoga Massage, has been overwhelmingly positive. My sense is that the world would be a healthier place if more people had access to this type of knowledge and experience, therefore; the mission of the ZIA PROJECT is to literally reach out and give people access to healing arts education.

The Medium
 
Thai Yoga Massage is an ancient healing art with origins in Ayurvedic Medicine, Yoga and Buddhism. Over the last 2500+ years, it has evolved into a unique and magical combination of deep stretching, rhythmic compression, soft-tissue manipulation, gentle rocking, energy balancing, and acupressure.     Thai Yoga Massage is the perfect medium for the Zia Project for the following reasons:

It is portable - all you need is a thin pad and a patch of floor, beach, or grass, and a willing recipient. 
It is universally accessible - no clothing is removed, no oils or lotions are required, no cultural boundaries are breached. 
It is grounding - because of the client's proximity to the floor, and because
 many of the techniques involve deep compression, its effect is 
inherently grounding. Being able to let go and feel the support of the earth is 
important for everyone, but particularly for people who's sense of place
 or tribe has been damaged or violated. 
It is effective - its relaxed pace and fluid movements tap into a deeply fundamental human
 rhythm that is profoundly relaxing to the nervous system. When one is in this relaxed state, unconscious holding patterns and traumatic 
residue are often released. 
It is an ideal small business - it requires a lot of heart, but little to no start-up costs.
It is necessary - we can all benefit from learning to give and receive healthy touch!

The ZIA PROJECT Vision

The project takes its name from the Zia (ZEE ah) people of northern New Mexico, who's  sun symbol and sacred teachings have captivated my imagination and lived in my heart since I was a young girl. The fact that ""Zia"" also means ""light"" in Latin, ""illuminated from within"" in Arabic, and ""Aunt"" in Italian, suggests that it is a name that will be recognized and associated with positive, nurturing, live-sustaining images all over the world - a happy coincidence for an organization with an international vision.

A parallel can also be drawn between the project's intention to promote healing arts education, and the Zia people's four sacred obligations. Both aim to help people cultivate practices that foster a strong body, a clear mind, a pure spirit and a devotion to the welfare of others. 

The Zia Project vision is divided into three phases.  In the first phase, a small team of volunteers will offer an introductory Thai Yoga Massage workshop in a marginalized or displaced community. During the workshop, individuals who have the aptitude and desire to continue on this path will be identified. In the second phase, we will provide those individuals with scholarships and/or mentorships in an effort to prepare them for a career in the healing arts. In the third phase, successful individuals will be given a small loan to start their own health oriented small business. 
This year we plan to work primarily with communities that we have already established a relationship with. Our focus will include careful documentation and analysis of the project in an effort to refine and improve upon our model. In the future, we hope to use this model as a basis for similar programs in new communities. I am specifically interested in expanding our relationships with indigenous peoples in the United States, Central, and South America. 




The first ZIA PROJECT
The first official Zia Project will unfold on the Andaman Coast of southern Thailand in February 2012. Twenty women, all tsunami survivors from local Muslim, Buddhist and Moken villages, will come together on the tiny island of Koh Phra Thong to spend a week learning Thai Yoga Massage. For the last several years these women's lives have been consumed by rebuilding their villages on safe ground and making sure that their family's basic needs have been met. Now they are ready for an opportunity to safely tear down some of the internal walls that they needed to survive in the wake of the tsunami and take some time to heal themselves and their community on a deep level. This introductory course will focus on basic breath and movement exercises, and traditional Thai Yoga Massage techniques performed in the supine position.Two women have been identified as leaders in the group, and have been offered scholarships to participate in a three week Thai Yoga Massage journey following the introductory course. During this journey, the women will have an opportunity to expand their Thai Yoga Massage knowledge to include techniques that are performed in the prone, side-lying and sitting positions.

Through these friendships, the local women will gain valuable insights, skills and business advice about working with the Western tourists who are increasingly returning to the Andaman Coast.When the local women have developed the skills necessary to safely and confidently practice Thai Yoga Massage, they will be assisted professionally and financially in launching a Thai Yoga Massage business that will successfully meet the needs of their communities. As part of their professional development they will become mentors and pass on their knowledge to the other women in their community who are interested in joining them on this path. ***One of the ways in which we will be documenting our first official project is through a documentary film. We are thrilled that Adam Taub, a cinematographer from Colorado who's films include La Quinceañera, Don Angelo, and El Duque de la Bachata has offered to join us in the field in February.

<h3>Empower Teens to Break-Away from Traditional Curricula</h3>
<p>Hi! I’m Colleen Mascenik. I’m a mother and development economist who believes that every teenager deserves the freedom to spend her time doing what interests her most. Over nearly 20 years at World Bank Group, I moved with my kids from country to country, and rather than enroll them in schools, we hired talented local artists, mathematicians, chess players and writers to work with each child, create learning plans around her or his interests, and find local volunteer work that spurred those interests along.</p>
<p>Now I’ve set off to build this vision into a <strong>not-for-profit organization that empowers small clusters of teenagers in the most challenging places to break-away from traditional curricula, discover their intrinsic interests, and pursue them deeply</strong> with the support of a mentor and our growing network of one-on-one chat. Check us out at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/breakawaylearning"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/breakawaylearning</a>! With the help of my friends and colleagues, Benazir Noorzad and Simin Shokrullah, <strong>Kabul is a great place to start</strong>.</p>
<p>(We've also launched a learning cluster in Bo City, Sierra Leone, as you'll see on our Facebook. An Indiegogo campaign for Sierra Leone coming in July!)</p>
<p><strong>What is individualized learning?</strong> For Kamal, age 14, this means advancing intensively into pre-calculus on Khan Academy, learning Python on Udemy and Codecademy, chatting with a Kyrgyz coder, and studying neural networks on Coursera. His goal is to complete the Coursera/Columbia University Micro-Masters in Artificial Intelligence in the next four years. For Maryam, age 16, this means exploring oil painting skills on Craftsy and in live studio sessions with a Ukrainian painter, while studying approaches to social media marketing on Udemy, and learning the fundamentals of art as a business on Coursera. Meanwhile, we are training Najiba, age 22 and herself an undergraduate, as a mentor who encourages and supervises the cluster, suggests additional content, and puts the students in touch with Kabul-based professionals in their chosen fields.</p>
<p><strong>What does it take to create a cluster?</strong> We focus on what counts--the student. We recruit English-speaking students ages 13-20, with an emphasis on girls. We meet students and their families one-on-one, listen and work together to create learning plans that make sense for each teen. We hire and train mentors, purchase second-hand tablets and laptops for each student, borrow or rent rooms and small apartments, arrange wifi where we can get it (or shuttle students and devices to internet cafes for intermittent access and bulk downloading), we buy back-up generators and collect used furniture. Students rotate in small groups through the shared learning space for a few hours each day; some continue to be enrolled at regular schools, as required by law. <strong>In short, we do everything we can to enable focused, world-class learning as economically as possible.</strong> We charge a modest tuition fee (in Kabul, it is US$21/month, or AFN 1500) that partially covers costs. We are NOT a school and we don’t advertise ourselves as such.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>In Kabul, we have 18 enrolled students and we aim for 56. Delivering cluster learning in Kabul will cost about US$50 per student per month, of which our students pay $21 per month themselves--that’s most of the fixed and local costs. We’re asking donors to provide the other $29, the cost of students’ chatting on our marketplace of experts. (We provide monthly coupons, and students decide with whom to chat; chat-providers earn this subsidy).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523953727/etp9j162uycwpin9fpyw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If we don’t manage to reach our goal, students will have fewer chats (e.g., learning will be less personalized). We continue increasing the number of clusters to offset coordination costs, and to strike a balance between cluster size and affordability for students.</p>
<p>We are a U.S. registered, not-for-profit charitable organization, with Tax ID# 82-5047330, incorporated in Pittston, Maine. Your contribution is tax deductible!</p>
<p><strong>Perks:</strong> Our Kabul students and experts want to share with you a bit about themselves. For a donation of $10, we’ll send you a postcard portrait of one of our students. For a donation of $29, we’ll send you a 8.5""x11"" color print of Tahera’s painting. For a donation of $200, we’ll send you a 16""x20"" print of Benazir’s pen-and-ink zentangle. For a donation of $1000, we’ll send you a 24""x36"" art-quality photo enlargement of the whole Kabul cluster. And for a donation of $5000, we’ll create an ongoing learning cluster of at least 24 teenage students in the city of your choice within the next 6 months (All clusters are fee-based with monthly fees targeted to recover recurring costs at levels affordable to low-income families, and include learning space, local mentorship, individualized learning plans for each student, tablets and laptops for each student, wifi and utilities. Not available in Cuba, Iran or North Korea).</p>
<h3>IMPACT: What will your contribution do?</h3>
<p>Kabul is just the first step to get cluster-learning started. We intend to grow from the most difficult places, scaling up <strong>small, informal clusters as an alternative to traditional secondary study</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Our long-range vision is a transformation of teen education into something radically individualized, leveraging already-existing abundant free courseware, complemented by one-on-one human conversation.</strong> We’re expanding a curated, fee-based marketplace of one-on-one chat (at <a href=""http://www.breakawaylearning.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.breakawaylearning.org</a>) at the same time we build learning clusters. Our local coordinators recruit chat-providers at the same time that they run student clusters. And by subsidizing the early usage of this marketplace, we are activating brilliant and interesting voices that will become a valued resource for paying students in wealthier markets later on.</p>
<p><strong>What is a marketplace of chat?</strong> Santos will talk to you about how Ebola ravaged his community and took most of the lives of his family in Sierra Leone in 2015, but how changes in burial practices and better communication saved his life ($4 for 30 minutes). Leang shares his perspective as a political opposition activist in Phnom Penh who survived an unaccounted grenade attack ($4 for 20 minutes). Tanya shares the early design inspiration for Uklon, the Ukrainian ride-sharing app that preceded Uber ($4 for 20 minutes). Steven shares the work he’s doing at Kenya Wildlife Service to apply remote sensors and drones to track elephant populations ($6 for 20 minutes). <i>These are the voices that inspire teen learning</i>. A young person engages in hundreds of these conversations, not necessarily to build skills or memorize content, but to explore the range of human experiences and begin to identify her passions and possibilies for development in the years ahead. </p>
<p>I’m an American mom, too, so I know teenagers’ reactions. “<i>Will this be on the test? Am I gonna get credit for it?</i>” The intellectual laziness and grades-obsession created by secondary schools would make exploratory learning and a chat marketplace seem pointless. But it’s <i>school </i>that is pointless, and I’m convinced that <strong>a transformation is coming in the next 10 years</strong>. And it’s starting in the poorest cities, because those teens have the most to lose by staying on traditional paths. For the smartest teens in places like Kabul, a culture of obedient school-going is a step-ladder to nowhere; it will be replaced by <strong>a culture of creative individualism. “</strong><i><strong>I study what interests me. I learn because I want to</strong></i>.<strong>”</strong> And that kind of inspiration is contagious.</p>
<h3>RESULTS MEASUREMENT:</h3>
<p>Our bottom line is different from schools, because we’re NOT a school. We don’t administer standardized tests or compare students’ (temporary) content mastery. Students get their own feedback, grades and certificates for the individually-selected courseware, chats, and tutorials they pursue. Mentors overlay that with guidance and subjective feedback. We measure across time and against control groups our students’ self-reported level of <i>Motivation</i> toward learning, <i>Ownership</i> of the learning process, and <i>Market Readiness</i>.</p>
<p><strong>We believe we’re on to something, and that when cluster-learning works in the most difficult places, wealthier markets will begin to pay attention</strong>.</p>
<h3>RISKS:</h3>
<p>We are working in difficult places, and we face real risks. Our Kabul students, and particularly our girls, are vulnerable to attacks that target perceived Western cultural symbols and female empowerment. We don't share students' surnames, and only share first names with their consent. We don't publicly share the street addresses of our clusters in Afghanistan. We operate with very little concrete resources, but the ones we have are exposed. We empower our students by giving them laptops and tablets. We manage cash locally. We steward our resources through intensive local leadership, and make the most use of messaging apps as possible, both to avoid unnecessary travel risks and to dedicate as much budget as possible to delivering for our students. We’ve designed three-way monitoring, so that our coordinators and students monitor our mentors; our mentors monitor our students; and our students also report on themselves. We track our funds, but understand that the operating environment is extremely risky.</p>
<h3>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP:</h3>
<p>I’m glad you’re reading about The BreakAway Learning Project, even if you don’t contribute today. You may have a new view about cluster-learning, and maybe you’ll get a cluster started in your own community. You might scroll through the chats and chat-projects on our site, at <a href=""http://www.breakawaylearning.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.breakawaylearning.org</a>, and find inspiration of your own. You might loosen up on your own teenager, and give her or him the creative space to figure out what he/she’s really into. <strong>Creative learning is contagious-- spread the word!</strong></p>

Our long-range vision is a transformation of teen education into something radically individualized, leveraging already-existing abundant free courseware, complemented by one-on-one human conversation. We’re expanding a curated, fee-based marketplace of one-on-one chat (at www.breakawaylearning.org) at the same time we build learning clusters. Our local coordinators recruit chat-providers at the same time that they run student clusters. And by subsidizing the early usage of this marketplace, we are activating brilliant and interesting voices that will become a valued resource for paying students in wealthier markets later on.
What is a marketplace of chat? Santos will talk to you about how Ebola ravaged his community and took most of the lives of his family in Sierra Leone in 2015, but how changes in burial practices and better communication saved his life ($4 for 30 minutes). Leang shares his perspective as a political opposition activist in Phnom Penh who survived an unaccounted grenade attack ($4 for 20 minutes). Tanya shares the early design inspiration for Uklon, the Ukrainian ride-sharing app that preceded Uber ($4 for 20 minutes). Steven shares the work he’s doing at Kenya Wildlife Service to apply remote sensors and drones to track elephant populations ($6 for 20 minutes). These are the voices that inspire teen learning. A young person engages in hundreds of these conversations, not necessarily to build skills or memorize content, but to explore the range of human experiences and begin to identify her passions and possibilies for development in the years ahead. 
I’m an American mom, too, so I know teenagers’ reactions. “Will this be on the test? Am I gonna get credit for it?” The intellectual laziness and grades-obsession created by secondary schools would make exploratory learning and a chat marketplace seem pointless. But it’s school that is pointless, and I’m convinced that a transformation is coming in the next 10 years. And it’s starting in the poorest cities, because those teens have the most to lose by staying on traditional paths. For the smartest teens in places like Kabul, a culture of obedient school-going is a step-ladder to nowhere; it will be replaced by a culture of creative individualism. “I study what interests me. I learn because I want to.” And that kind of inspiration is contagious.
RESULTS MEASUREMENT:
Our bottom line is different from schools, because we’re NOT a school. We don’t administer standardized tests or compare students’ (temporary) content mastery. Students get their own feedback, grades and certificates for the individually-selected courseware, chats, and tutorials they pursue. Mentors overlay that with guidance and subjective feedback. We measure across time and against control groups our students’ self-reported level of Motivation toward learning, Ownership of the learning process, and Market Readiness.
We believe we’re on to something, and that when cluster-learning works in the most difficult places, wealthier markets will begin to pay attention.
RISKS:
We are working in difficult places, and we face real risks. Our Kabul students, and particularly our girls, are vulnerable to attacks that target perceived Western cultural symbols and female empowerment. We don't share students' surnames, and only share first names with their consent. We don't publicly share the street addresses of our clusters in Afghanistan. We operate with very little concrete resources, but the ones we have are exposed. We empower our students by giving them laptops and tablets. We manage cash locally. We steward our resources through intensive local leadership, and make the most use of messaging apps as possible, both to avoid unnecessary travel risks and to dedicate as much budget as possible to delivering for our students. We’ve designed three-way monitoring, so that our coordinators and students monitor our mentors; our mentors monitor our students; and our students also report on themselves. We track our funds, but understand that the operating environment is extremely risky.
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP:
I’m glad you’re reading about The BreakAway Learning Project, even if you don’t contribute today. You may have a new view about cluster-learning, and maybe you’ll get a cluster started in your own community. You might scroll through the chats and chat-projects on our site, at www.breakawaylearning.org, and find inspiration of your own. You might loosen up on your own teenager, and give her or him the creative space to figure out what he/she’s really into. Creative learning is contagious-- spread the word!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

and music study develops skills that are necessary in the workplace.  Yet, for some time now, there has been little or no music education in the

public schools.  The cost of private
lessons is prohibitive at best.
Since 1937, the Boys & Girls Club of Hollywood
(BGCH) has provided thousands of underserved, low income youth with a safe
place to go after school.  Over 1,400
kids participate in social, recreational, and educational opportunities
including MUSIC LESSONS year round.  The
majority of our members (71%) live in low income households.
In 1998, the BGCH began collaborating with UCLA’s
Music Partnership Program.  UCLA provides the expertise with a Music
Director, music instructors, and partial funding of the program cost.  The BGCH clubhouse has two dedicated
soundproofed music rooms with two pianos, a music room with an additional
piano, four electric keyboards, and eight guitars.  Children between the ages of 6-15 participate
in weekly lessons with UCLA music instructors in piano and/or
guitar as well as the opportunity to practice daily.  The music program has attracted the attention
of the club members and every year there are waiting lists for both piano and

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are a music private school in Crystal Lake Ill.    It was founded by Mrs. Villec who taught music in the public and private schools for many years, as well as private lessons.    It currently has 13 teachers and about 150 students.    We offer classes as well as private lessons for Voice, Piano, Guitar, Strings (including Harp), Woodwind, and Brass and Percussion.   We give the students much experience in performance as we put on at least 2 - 6 shows per year at no extra cost to them.   In addition, for the shows we pull together the private students to work on ensemble and band music in order to get much needed experience performing with other students.   Our teachers are of the highest quality, with degrees in music, music education, as well as exceptional professional performing experience.    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The economic crisis hit just as Music Maker's was taking off (we are in our 5th year).    The founder had quit her full time music job to devote all of her time to this school just before the crises.   At the same time, many students were forced to quit due to job losses in their families.   Some have still not been able to return.   We have lost many students over the last couple years due to the situation, and just lost a few more in the last couple weeks for the same reason.   It is an understatement to say that it is a miracle we've survived!    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But, we have been fortunate to pick up new students as well along the way,and even have had to move to a bigger unit.     Of course that means more rent, and hiring employees to answer phones and handle the schedule.   So while we've helped a few students continue at our cost, we can not afford to help any more than those few.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are a private music school in Crystal Lake Ill.    Crystal Lake is part of McHenry County, and near Cook County.   In general it is a middle class area.   We have wonderful public and private schools but most of them have cut or are in the process of cutting music programs.    Your funds would help us offer scholarships and aid to those students that can not afford lessons at this time! In most cases it would be a temporary situation; just until the parents find a job, or restructure their finances.    I will immediately call all the students we've lost the last couple years and offer them assistance for lessons   I will  also approach schools and ask if there are any students for whom music was their one saving grace in life, but it had been cut from the program.   <br/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to offer aid and start a foundation whereby local business can also contribute to the cause.   The funds will be used to pay the teachers for lessons for those students that are in need of lessons but  can not afford them.   We will give updates of specific cases where your money helped!    What you get:   the knowledge and satisfaction that you have helped change a child's life!   Once they can read music and play an instrument, they are more likely to go down a good path in life and stay out of trouble (check out the studies at our website).   They're more likely to do better in math, reading and science.   They're more likely to be happy, pursue their dreams, and become quality citizens in our society!     Actually, you'll be helping hundreds of children in this regard!    Check out our perks and Check us out at our website:  <a href=""http://www.musicmakers4life.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.musicmakers4life.com</a> and don't forget to click the link that shows a few of our past performances!</p>

</h3>
</li>
</ul><h3>Short Summary</h3><p>Pushing the limits of human endurance  by snorkeling in unforgiving arctic waters requires lots of specialized  gear—lots of dive gear, including safety equipment, which translates into <em>epic </em>excess baggage costs…</p>
<p>  Our team of ten female explorers has recently  returned from conducting a proof-of-concept expedition to Newfoundland, Labrador,  Western Greenland and Iceland. During the past year, we raised 80 percent of  our expedition costs. But, we still owe $50,000 for this expedition.</p>
<p>  We’re raising global awareness about  disappearing sea ice and ocean change in the Arctic, and we need your help to  pay off our debt.</p>
<p>  In July 10-27, 2014, the 2014-2016  Sedna Epic Expedition successfully ran its sea trials in arctic waters filled  with pack ice and icebergs. Using diver propulsion vehicles and supported by  the 116-foot <em>MV Cape Race</em>, we  demonstrated that snorkelers can successfully ‘go the distance’ in coastal  waters and in open waters more than 9,000 feet deep. Intent on firsts, we even  snorkeled across the Arctic Circle!</p>
<p>  We also conducted marine mammal and  sea bird surveys during the expedition. Using a remotely operated vehicle and  mobile touch aquariums, we brought the ocean ‘to eye level,’ delivering a  hands-on ocean educational outreach program to the Inuit community of Nain,  Labrador. In St. John’s, Newfoundland, we spoke to 49 young women, ages 16 and  17, about pursuing careers in science, exploration and movie making.</p>
<p>  This proof-of-concept expedition is  crucial to reaching our ultimate goal of snorkeling Canada’s Northwest  Passage—all 3,000 kilometers of it—during the summer of 2016. We can’t achieve  one without the other, so your support is essential to the success of both of  our missions.</p>

<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We need $50,000 to cover the final costs
  of our expedition for 2014.<span>  That money
  covers the cost of the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Gear for
    snorkeling in arctic waters</li>
<li>Global
    rescue insurance</li>
<li>Freight
    costs for gear</li>
<li>Filming
    the expedition</li>
<li>Scientific
    equipment for outreach and education </li>
<li>Diver
    propulsion vehicles to scoot along with in the snorkel zone</li>
</ul><br/><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of our all-female
  expedition is both local and global. During the expedition, we’re reaching out
  to the communities we visit. Simultaneously, we’re connecting to a global
  community who is supporting and following our international expedition.
  Immersing ourselves in the issue of disappearing sea ice, we’ll translate our
  findings into educational and awareness programs of ocean change. </p>
<p>The expedition will
  serve as a ""call to action"" for citizens of the world, including
  youth, providing aboriginal and scientific knowledge to inform governments of
  the world on implementing science-based policies to mitigate global warming.
  The expedition will also serve to inspire women and girls to think ""big,""
  and to follow their dreams, no matter how out-of-the box they may appear... </p>
<p>Providing
  educational and life role models, we’ll reach out to Inuit and Inuvialuit women
  and girls, empowering them to build resilient communities to mitigate the
  impacts of societal and climate change.</p>

Short SummaryPushing the limits of human endurance  by snorkeling in unforgiving arctic waters requires lots of specialized  gear—lots of dive gear, including safety equipment, which translates into epic excess baggage costs…
  Our team of ten female explorers has recently  returned from conducting a proof-of-concept expedition to Newfoundland, Labrador,  Western Greenland and Iceland. During the past year, we raised 80 percent of  our expedition costs. But, we still owe $50,000 for this expedition.
  We’re raising global awareness about  disappearing sea ice and ocean change in the Arctic, and we need your help to  pay off our debt.
  In July 10-27, 2014, the 2014-2016  Sedna Epic Expedition successfully ran its sea trials in arctic waters filled  with pack ice and icebergs. Using diver propulsion vehicles and supported by  the 116-foot MV Cape Race, we  demonstrated that snorkelers can successfully ‘go the distance’ in coastal  waters and in open waters more than 9,000 feet deep. Intent on firsts, we even  snorkeled across the Arctic Circle!
  We also conducted marine mammal and  sea bird surveys during the expedition. Using a remotely operated vehicle and  mobile touch aquariums, we brought the ocean ‘to eye level,’ delivering a  hands-on ocean educational outreach program to the Inuit community of Nain,  Labrador. In St. John’s, Newfoundland, we spoke to 49 young women, ages 16 and  17, about pursuing careers in science, exploration and movie making.
  This proof-of-concept expedition is  crucial to reaching our ultimate goal of snorkeling Canada’s Northwest  Passage—all 3,000 kilometers of it—during the summer of 2016. We can’t achieve  one without the other, so your support is essential to the success of both of  our missions.

What We Need and What You Get
 
We need $50,000 to cover the final costs
  of our expedition for 2014.  That money
  covers the cost of the following:

Gear for
    snorkeling in arctic waters
Global
    rescue insurance
Freight
    costs for gear
Filming
    the expedition
Scientific
    equipment for outreach and education 
Diver
    propulsion vehicles to scoot along with in the snorkel zone
The Impact
The impact of our all-female
  expedition is both local and global. During the expedition, we’re reaching out
  to the communities we visit. Simultaneously, we’re connecting to a global
  community who is supporting and following our international expedition.
  Immersing ourselves in the issue of disappearing sea ice, we’ll translate our
  findings into educational and awareness programs of ocean change. 
The expedition will
  serve as a ""call to action"" for citizens of the world, including
  youth, providing aboriginal and scientific knowledge to inform governments of
  the world on implementing science-based policies to mitigate global warming.
  The expedition will also serve to inspire women and girls to think ""big,""
  and to follow their dreams, no matter how out-of-the box they may appear... 
Providing
  educational and life role models, we’ll reach out to Inuit and Inuvialuit women
  and girls, empowering them to build resilient communities to mitigate the
  impacts of societal and climate change.

What lessons did you learn through summer camps that you participated in? What friendships did you build during those three months? What memories, lessons, and friendships will you help to nurture for these children?Volunteer! 
The camp needs volunteers in 3 hour blocks of time. In the amount of time it takes to go and watch one movie a week, you could develop a relationship with a child that may impact the course of their life - or yours! If you can help 
or if your church or civic group is interested, please contact Mrs. Jessica Lawrence at 423-260-3626.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Ink* is founded by three leaders in education around the world. Based upon the principle that getting ahead in life should not just be for those who are ahead in life, our leaders have already created three (yes three!) charter schools around the world.
 
Ok, But Really, What is Ink*?
There are 3 main components to Ink*-
(1) Our online educational platform- this platform, with its proprietary bank of test questions, will help students better understand their strengths and weaknesses within particular subjects.

<p><b>The Impact</b><br/></p>
<p>I have had the opportunity to participate in other projects overseas, especially in impoverished areas, that focused on healing, education, and community. It has been my experience that in addition to the concrete actions and accomplishments, the impact of the support itself is powerful. Sometimes, having people come and be deeply emotionally invested in your project and work to help you accomplish your goals nourishes the soul so that you can keep fighting the good fight, so to speak.  I have also learned that when I return home and share with students, educators, community members and so on, I foster a change in perspective. One more small grain of peace.</p>

In the past 5 years alone, Tom has performed and spoken to over 1 million young people with his powerful life-changing story in 4 countries and 40 states.
We want to reach even more youth in this world with this assembly. After each assembly, students are lined up to speak to Tom.  Thousands of emails pour in each year with students sharing their stories of how the school assembly has transformed and saved their life from destruction.
There are not to many school assemblies that tackle the tough issues of bullying, suicide, cutting, etc in a ""cool"" modern way that impact middle and high school students long after the assembly is over!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
</div>
<div>Hello everyone! My name is Karen and I am currently a social work student at the University of Utah. I will be graduating with my Masters this August...woohoo!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Before graduating, I must complete a practicum placement where I volunteer my expertise to an agency in order to gain real life social work experience. As a social worker with strong interests in global social welfare, I felt it was important for me to gain international experience. I applied and have been accepted to go to wonderful program in Kerala, India where I will be working with children who have been separated from their families because either one or both of their parents are in prison.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This agency is the only of its kind in India and they run an amazing program! All the children live on site at the agency either because their extended families do no want them or cannot afford to provide for them. The agency sees to all aspects of the childrens development including education, skills development, mentoring, and therapy in addition to a home environment.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>During my three months of work, I will be utilizing a number of expressive therapy techniques (such as dance therapy and art therapy) to work with the children to help develop self-efficacy and self-esteem.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Completing my practicum in Kerela will afford me the opportunity to engage in a cross-cultural exchange of ideas which I can then bring back to my own community.

<h3>Where Will the Money Go?</h3>
<p>One housing unit is $7000. If we raise <em>$7000 or less</em>, 100% of those funds will go toward building the very first housing unit for the orphans.</p>
<p>If we raise <em>more than $7000</em>, we will use the excess to cover Autumn &amp; Christina's expenses for the climb (park fees, hiring guides, renting equipment, etc). This <strong><em>excludes</em></strong> our airticket. That already came out of our own pocket. </p>
<p>After the $7000 for the first housing unit + our climbing expenses, <em>all other funds</em> will go towards GHM and the 2nd housing unit...then the 3rd...then the 4th...and so on.</p>
<p>* As you very well know, exact figures/plans may change because of, well, life and its charming habit of giving us unpredictable circumstances. Whatever surprises may come our way, be rest assured, at the end of the campaign/climb, we will send you a <em>financial report</em> telling you exactly where your funds were allocated. </p>

Where Will the Money Go?
One housing unit is $7000. If we raise $7000 or less, 100% of those funds will go toward building the very first housing unit for the orphans.
If we raise more than $7000, we will use the excess to cover Autumn & Christina's expenses for the climb (park fees, hiring guides, renting equipment, etc). This excludes our airticket. That already came out of our own pocket. 
After the $7000 for the first housing unit + our climbing expenses, all other funds will go towards GHM and the 2nd housing unit...then the 3rd...then the 4th...and so on.
* As you very well know, exact figures/plans may change because of, well, life and its charming habit of giving us unpredictable circumstances. Whatever surprises may come our way, be rest assured, at the end of the campaign/climb, we will send you a financial report telling you exactly where your funds were allocated. 
 
 
Give Once And It Will Last Forever (theoretically)
It's simple: GHM pledges to use funds wisely and appropriately. GHM school will teach 300 students. Tuition from 150 village students will pay for the school and the orphanage. This means 150 orphans will receive free education, housing, food, and loving care. 
To get to this point, GHM actually needs BUILDINGS. They've already built one school and classes are already in session. GHM as an organization is still on ""Phase One"" of their building project.

<p>Afghanistan has been subject to decades of war leading to its socio-political unrest.  With an almost non-existent education system pre-September 11, 2001, Afghanistan had one of the weakest systems of education in the world.  Through education, the Afghan people will repair, rebuild and create self-sustainment.  Another important endeavor with this project is creating the opportunity for girls to attend school throughout the country.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Sebastian is currently attending Le Cordon Bleu Chef school in Seattle.  This is her third 6-week term and she's doing really well - very close to the top of her class!  Sebastian got a partial scholarship and loans for tuition, but needs help with living expenses as she studies for school and cares for her 2-1/2 year old granddaughter, Malia. She's tried to get another loan, and had a co-signer with excellent credit but she was still denied.  We think it is because she is an ex-offender.  Please help Sebastian finish school by supporting our campaign! The total amount we need is $9,000 but we're starting out with $5,000.  Sebastian has been a leader in the ex-offender community by working with Keeping the Faith/The Prison Project and going back into the prison where she was incarcerated. She continues to inspire many women still in prison by having strong goals and working in the community. For donating, we prefer PayPal, but if you don't have a PayPal account, you can use your debit/credit card. Thank you!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we don't raise this money, Sebastian may have to quit school.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds we raise on this site will go directly to costs related to school, supplies, and, most importantly, study time for Sebastian to continue getting great grades in school.  The stress of not having enough funds to live and take care of her granddaughter weigh heavily on her, although she is very upbeat on a daily basis.  There are some wonderful perks! For $10 you get a graduation photo of Sebastian, for $100 you get a cobalt-blue mug from Le Cordon Bleu, and for $500 you get a sit-down dinner for up to 6 people prepared by the newly graduated 'Chef Sebastian!'  Any amount of donation is deeply appreciated!  All donations to Sebastian's School Campaign are tax-deductible through the Pat Graney Company, a non-profit organization.  For donating, we prefer PayPal, but if you don't have a PayPal account, you can use your debit/credit card.

<h3>StartupDesk was created by scratching our own itch!!</h3>
<p>We are experienced, early stage technology folks who have come upon the problem of needing desks/workstations for developers, designers and other team members for our companies.  Typical office workstation solutions lack soul and are exorbitantly expensive.  They aren't hackable - they can't really grow and adapt.  They are for Dilbert not us.</p>
<p>We fell upon the ideas for these desks from many sources, have tweaked them for our own needs and would love to offer the benifit of our experience to others who find themselves in the same boat.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Startup desk is manufactured from solid, honest raw materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 inch black iron pipe</li>
<li>1 inch iron fittings</li>
<li>2 layers of 3/4 inch plywood</li>
<li>The surface is stained and finished to a modern industrial type of finish</li>
</ul>
<p>Order the plans, the parts or us to deliver it and assemble the parts for you.  For parts or delivered, order one 'perk' per desk needed.  Ideally, for deliveries it would be best to have 5 or more desks involved.  If you have special requests, variations to the design  we would be open to discuss.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, My name is Janeen Edwards. I am a 15 year old high school honors student.</p>
<p>My mother is a single parent that breaks her back supporting my younger brother and I.  My mother, the amazing person that she is, raised me to believe that I could acomplish anything that put my mind to so long as I am determined and dedicated to my goals. </p>
<p>I remember my mother reading to me every night before I went to bed and helping with my homework every single day when I got home from school. She instilled in me a passion for learning, and made sure that I would be able to have a better future than she had and that I was given opportunities that were not offered to her. Even though I come from a low income family she has never allowed it to put a strain on the things that I strive for in life.</p>
<p>Over the years, thanks to my mother, I felt the need to volunteer in my community and do well in my education. I joined my school key club and volunteer at my local VFW [A Veterans Center]. I participate in Drama Club, Newspaper, Debate Team, Book Club, Art Society and am also a member of my high school's Varsity Track and Cross Country teams.</p>
<p>I have always wanted to have an opportunity to study abroad in high school and establish myself as a global citizen. Earlier this year I applied to AFS Intercultural programs to study abroad in their Germany year program and was accepted. They have given me the opportunity to be an ambassador for AFS - established during World War 1 as the American Field Service.</p>
<p>After all the work that my mother has done for me over the years I want to know that I have made her proud just as much as I want to make my dreams happen. I have never worked so hard for something in my life and as much as mother wishes she could give me all the money that I need for this herself, we both know that she doesn't have that kind of money. All of my contributors would be helping me to achieve all that my mother has constantly pushed me to work hard for.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With the help of my mother I was able to receive financial aid and scholarships based on merit. Although my tuition has been paid in full my mother cannot afford to send me 240 miles to Washington D.C. to begin my program or send me the spending money that I will need to buy food, pay for transportation and communicate with my mother and family during the 10 months that I will be living with a host family in Germany. If I do not raise money I will not be able to participate in this program and all the hard work that my mother and I have put into this will have been for nothing. Out of the initial 17,500 I needed to raise I need the remaining $4,000.</p>
<ul>
<li>$300 for the plane ticket 240 miles to Washington D.C. and fees</li>
<li>around $300 a month [$3000] for spending money; such as traveling back and forth on the train to school everyday, lunch money - German schools don't serve lunch so I have to find a place to eat in town, German pre-paid phone cards to call my mother and little brother, and the unknown expenses [emergencies, toiletries, shoes, gloves, a winter coat]</li>
<li>$200 for my residence permit to live in Germany for 10 months while I am studying abroad</li>
<li>$500 for a camera and other electronics - for my photo portfolio for college, a phone and laptop for the online classes I am taking to have sufficient credits to graduate from high school when I return home for my Senior year of high school.</li>
</ul>
<p>With every contribution you will receive something in from me to show my gratitude, no matter how big or small the donate; I send a thank you to all of my contributors and depending on how much your contribute you can receive digital portraits drawn by me in a select choice of medium, graphic designs, personal blog templates and a digital album of my original photos taken in Germany.</p>

Check us out at knowyourix.org and help us ensure that students everywhere know their Title IX right to an education free from sexual violence and harassment. Many thanks to all our supporters for making this dream a reality!


In 1972, Title IX of the Education Amendments prohibited sex-based discrimination in schools, guaranteeing students essential and extensive rights to freedom from sexual violence necessary for equal access to education. In 2011, Vice President Biden clarified the standards to which higher education institutions must adhere, including specific guidelines for addressing reports of sexual misconduct. 
Yet too many colleges today are failing to fulfill their legal and ethical obligations. In the past year, sexual violence survivors have shared their experiences of administrative neglect, disregard, and abuse at institutions including Amherst College, the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, Yale University, Occidental College, Northwestern University, and Rice University. Their experiences are not unique but representative of sexually hostile campus environments across the country.
We believe it is time for change. Let’s make next semester better than this one.
 
Know Your IX is a campaign that aims to educate every college student in the U.S. about his or her rights under Title IX by the start of the Fall 2013 academic term. Armed with information, survivors will be able to advocate for themselves during their schools’ grievance proceedings and, if Title IX guarantees are not respected, to file a complaint against their colleges with the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights. When colleges are confronted with their students’ knowledge and thirst for justice, they will be forced to take proactive steps to end sexual violence, ensuring every student a safe educational environment.
 

 

 
Know Your IX is an activist collective run by students and young alumni who have successfully campaigned against their colleges' inadequate responses to campus sexual violence. We connected online through our activism, as featured in the New York Times.

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<h3>
<strong>CHANGE - 2/7/13: NEW LESSER AMOUNT NEEDED!</strong><br/><strong>INSTEAD of $1192.00 REALLY ONLY NEED TOTAL of $650.00</strong> </h3>
<h3>Woo Hoo! A great friend of mine covered RT airfare! Another very supportive SROH team member has covered the conference fees (ahead of late registration deadline saving another $45). Reducing the amount needed by over $500.</h3>
<h2>*<strong>Indiegogo will not allow you to change the amount once started so trying to announce it here. $650 Neede Less $285 Raised = $365.00 Left to Go!</strong>
</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Christianna Capra ""CC"". I have been an EAGALA member since 2007 and am now a lifetime member.</p>
<p>Realizing that with my head buried in the running of 2 businesses and also freelancing to keep the bills paid, the 14th Annual EAGALA Conference is sneaking up on me...and...realizing that...I actually need to attend to keep my certification intact. Yikes!</p>
<p>The past 2 years have housed much growth, many enriching / expanding experiences, and also several challenges to overcome. One of the challenges has been cash flow, esp on the personal level since every dime I seem to make goes into, gets eaten by (literally) the businesses and my beloved 4 legged colleagues. I really need to get to Tennessee this March and have no real idea how to pay for it.</p>
<p>I get that I wont have the same draw that our rockstar mare Straw has, but still hopeful I can end up in Franklin TN on March 13th, 2013! :)</p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<div>
<p>Essentially have done the math to the penny to get there. Am going to attempt an airline ticket via ""miles"" but here is the rest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conference Fee for 2013: $435.00 (plus balance due of last conference in 2011 of $185)= $620 Total.</li>
<li>Hotel contribution (sharing room with other members) of $200 for 3  nights.</li>
<li>Minimal expenses: airport parking, transportation from TN airport to hotel, transportation from conference back to airport, travel incidentals, etc. Total estimate is $175-200.</li>
<li>Airline ticket from Newark NJ to Nashville TN (leave on Wed 3/13 and return on Sat 3/16). I have some miles on AA so hoping to get my flight that way...</li>
</ul>
By going to this conference, I will keep my certification intact, I will make some imortant contacts and gain more knowledge to further forward both Spring Reins of Hope (LLC, 2008) and also Spring Reins of Life (501c3, 2011) to provide EAP and EAL services in NYC, NJ, and Eastern PA.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It has been a huge lesson for me to learn - to ask for help and support. This is a step in my growth to humble myself and raise a hand up for help (I dont have any issue asking on behalf of others /horses, but for me personally its easier to keep quiet and suffer around it. I am asking now. ;)</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>HISTORY &amp; COMMITMENT TO ""THE DREAM""...</h3>
<div>
<p>In 2006, my totem horse had reached rock bottom in attempts to recover from Lyme Disease. This is the time when I met Dr. Judith Shoemaker, DVM who brought him back to health with alternative and holistic remedies. At the same time Dr. Shoemaker introduced me to the EAGALA Model of EAP and EAL where horses can help humans lead healthier more productive lives.</p>
<p>I became EAGALA Certified immediately, in that I knew it was my life's calling. <br/>Except from the 2008 NWL book, Horses With A Mission: <a href=""http://www.springreinsofhope.com/PDF/SROH-About%20Us%20-HorsesWithAMission-Final%20Web%202009%20Story.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.springreinsofhope.com/PDF/SROH-About%20Us%20-HorsesWithAMission-Final%20Web%202009%20Story.pdf</a></p>
<p>In 2008 I co-founded an LLC offering EAP and EAL services in NY, NJ and East PA called Spring Reins of Hope (<a href=""http://www.springreinsofhope.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.springreinsofhope.com</a>). SROH provides private pay sessions in EAP and EAL services for Individuals, Couples, Families, and Groups. Also for corporations and organizations.</p>
<p>In 2011 I co-founded a 501c3, called Spring Reins of Life (<a href=""http://www.springreinsoflife.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.springreinsoflife.org</a>) which is actively fund raising for its targeted populaitons - At Risk Youth, Military Veterans and their Families, and Bereaved Children. The nonprofit has a growing waiting list for services on Veterans and At Risk Youth with a much accellorated need for funding resources. However this is a good problem for a budding NP to have.</p>
<p>Hard to be public here, but with the bills on the table and the projected income for next few months, there will not be any extra money to go to this conference. I am putting it in the hands of the creator to help find a way.</p>
<p>Let Go, and Let God - my Mother would say! So here is my letting go, and letting God - Please help me out.</p>
<p>For more information on the EAGALA Conference for this coming year in Franklin TN, see:  <a href=""http://www.eagala.org/14thConf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.eagala.org/14thConf</a></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Providing a security in mind to keep pushing the development of both businesses. If I am not current on certification this will cause a whole load of other problems to solve.</p>
<p>Shot in the arm! Being at the conference this year will provide some much needed connection, grounding, networking, and collaboration with other fellow EAGALA facilitators. I have been separated from the herd for 2 years. Other members have reached out to ask if I will be in TN, so I would love to, and I think I really need to say ""Yes"".</p>
<p>CC is playing the lottery once a week, (will only waste $1.00) for many reasons. However with less than 8 weeks left...it feels MORE realistic that this campaign will have better chances of being fulfilled.  LOL.</p>

<p>Dear Indie Go-Go Donors,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you so much for your support and donation to the Biscuit Brothers Fine Arts Farm. Although we did not reach our Indie go-go goal, due to a couple of wonderful corporate sponsors, we did have enough to submit a slightly different but legitimate proposal on the identified property. The contract was submitted this morning and we should have their response within 72 hours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the seller rejects our offer, all donations will be returned within the week. Never fear though, I am committed to make this happen if need be in another location somehow someway in 2013. And hey, it’s the holiday season, so regardless of the outcome, your fun Biscuit perks are in the mail!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So please keep your fingers crossed for the Biscuit Brothers Fine Arts Farm in 2013. And thanks again for your support.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>******************************************************************</p>
<p>Jerome Schoolar, Producer and Co-Creator of the Emmy Award winning PBS show “The Biscuit Brothers” is calling on fans to support the building of a new Fine Arts Farm in South Austin that will be designed to provide music and arts education to the entire community. The proposed facility will include concert and theatre space as well as multiple classrooms, a themed outdoor area, and plenty of Magical Musical Farm décor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I want to create a space where we can entertain and educate kids and families of all ages in all sorts of ways,” said Jerome Schoolar, who plays Dusty on the show and has served as a City of Austin Fine Arts Coordinator for Children.  “Our vision includes regular classes, special concerts, theatrical guests, and more, with much of it low-cost or even free to Title 1 AISD schools and other at-risk members of our community.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Biscuit Brothers have a long history of providing inexpensive or free shows to the public - often benefitting other local organizations - and hope the new building near Slaughter Lane and I-35 will help sustain those as well as the TV show which is given to PBS for free.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“This is a big undertaking,” Schoolar said.  “We're going to need a lot of individuals and community partners to donate through the project at indiegogo.com we'll be launching on October 16, or even provide long-term sponsorship funds.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$50,000 is needed to secure the property and begin upgrades.  Schoolar says he hopes to raise at least $25,000 with the indiegogo and another $25,000 from corporate sponsors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“We've got some amazing rewards for our indiegogo supporters, including free classes and invitations to participate in the permanent decorations of the building.  For our top indiegogo donors or corporate sponsors, we're offering chances to name classrooms and more. And for everyone, we're offering the chance to help build a facility that has the potential to make a lasting impact across our entire community.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Schoolar points to multiple studies on both the national and local scale that highlight the importance of Fine Arts training in education. “There's ample evidence showing that children who are actively involved in Fine Arts Education are smarter, healthier, and happier, and that exposure needs to begin as early as possible with reliable consistency. The Biscuit Brothers have always been about fostering musical education for young kids, and now we want to broaden that to a fully artistic and really fun Fine Arts Farm.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If the funding goal to open the Biscuit Brothers Fine Arts Farm is not reached then all donations will be returned.</strong></p>

<p class=""normalweb1""><br/> DNA on a SHIRT™ displays what makes us different, and, more important, the bonds we share with all life. Primates have the closest DNA percentage to humans, with the orangutan alone sharing 96.4% DNA similarity.</p>
<p class=""normalweb1""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: red;""><br/></span></span>At the time when this project was undertaken, the Phoenix Zoo was the proud home of the oldest living Bornean orangutan in North America: Duchess, a 52 year-old female. As one of the first animals to arrive at the Zoo, Duchess charmed the hearts of many the minute she arrived. She was born in the jungles of Borneo, where she was orphaned at a very young age. When Duchess came to Phoenix in 1962, it was determined that she was approximately two years old.</p>
<p class=""NormalWeb1""><img alt=""FAce shot of Duchess"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/qCH8O.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Duchess from the Phoenix Zoo""/></p>
<p class=""NormalWeb1""> </p>
<p class=""normalweb1"">During her life, Duchess, the eventual matriarch of the Phoenix Zoo’s orangutan family, gave birth to seven babies. Currently, her three remaining children, along with her grandchildren, are living in zoos across the country. Her legacy lives on through her offspring, and she and her family have been strong ambassadors for their species.</p>
<p class=""normalweb1"">Early in June 2012, keepers started to notice that Duchess wasn’t feeling well.  The Phoenix Zoo’s on-site veterinary staff determined that she was suffering from high grade lymphosarcoma. This extreme form of cancer spread aggressively over the course of a couple weeks, and she passed away on June 24, 2012. Though she is gone, she lives on in the hearts of many.</p>
<p class=""normalweb1"">Duchess entertained and mesmerized millions of visitors over her five decades at the Zoo. Most often, guests and staff would comment on her eyes and that when she looked at you, she seemed to be staring straight into your soul. She was wise and majestic, funny and serious, and playful and beautiful.</p>
<p class=""normalweb1"">Denise Wagner joined the Phoenix Zoo as part of the primate staff in 2004 and was one of two main caregivers of Duchess and the other primates. Duchess had a tremendous impact on her and the other staff members. “She really made me realize what it was like to be an ambassador for the species,"" Wagner says.</p>
<p class=""normalweb1""> “Duchess lives on at the Phoenix Zoo in Bess, Kasih and her other offspring in zoos across the country. She is not gone, as her legacy is still carried on with her family,” expressed Wagner. “She will always be remembered and have<a name=""_GoBack"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>a special place in our hearts.”</p>
<p class=""normalweb1"">DNA on a SHIRT wants to honor Duchess' importance and impact by highlighting her as the first animal to be presented on the premiere DNA ZOO TEE™. We want the shirts to be a celebration of her life, in memory of her and the legacy that she has left on the world.

Welcome!</h3> <p>Thank you for watching our video for Surf Strong.  We are Sarah and Jerson, and we have started Surf Strong to help a small community in El Salvador, where young kids often have very little parental involvement and limited opportunity.  These kids spend a lot of time in the streets with negative influences and not enough to do, where they develop toxic friendships.  They ultimately become consumed within the circle of extreme poverty so widespread within El Salvador.  To escape this circle, parents and families often encourage their young children to make the dangerous migration to the United States to earn money and provide for the family illegally.  To these families, it is a choice between life and death; there is no other choice for their youth.<br/></p>
<p>Surf Strong is designed to provide an alternative.  We will provide a safe, positive environment in these kids' lives through a connection to surfing.  Through Surf Strong, the children will have access to surf boards and lessons, as well as lessons in English, photography, business, and more.  With their growing connection to the beach, they will develop a sense of pride in the beautiful place they come from, and <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">they will learn to take responsibility for their home, their actions, and their futures as they develop confidence and skills that will translate to all aspects of life. </span></p>
<p>Surf Strong is working to develop the next generation, of strong, confident, and capable leaders, and we need your help.  We are designed to be sustainable, however we need to raise our start-up funds.  Once we are off the  ground, we will be able to maintain our programs, only fundraising for expansion endeavors.  For every $200 raised, we can reach about 10 more kids per week...this week, next week, and every week after that.  Over the course of five years, that same $200 will still be helping kids!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need surfboards!  Ten softtop longboards to be exact, although the more we have, the more kids we can help.  Additionally, as the kids get better, they will move to standard shortboards, which we can buy used off of tourists looking to sell their boards quickly.  The longboards cost about $200 each, so we are looking at $2000 upfront in boards and another $1000 as the kids become more advanced.</li>
<li>We also need rashguards!  Rashguards are important, as a surf school without rashguards is like a hockey team without jerseys!  We want the kids to feel like they are a part of something awesome.  For some, this will be the first time in their lives they have something to be proud of.  Rashguards are expensive though, and we are looking at about $800-$1000 for this cost.</li>
<li>Other crucial components include chairs and a canopy tent on the beach, so participants have somewhere safe and fun to hang out while they escape the sun between sessions.  We also need signs to make our organization legitimate.  It isn't much, but culturally, if you have spent even a small amount of money on a sign, you mean serious business.  Total cost, approximately $400.<br/>
</li>
<li>We are planting a small garden to grow vegetables for lunches!  We will provide a healthy meal to every kid, every day.  Many of these kids beg for food during the day so they can eat at night, and eat little more than beans and tortillas every single day.  The cost of the garden is approximately $150.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>Check out the perks to the side to get more information on what we can now afford due to your generous donation!<br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact <br/>
</h3> <p>In the United States recently, you may have seen news about growing numbers of unaccompanied minors.  These young kids are mostly from the countries of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala.  The reason is this: THEY HAVE NO CHOICE.</p>
<p>Often times, these kids are targeted by violence, or have become the breadwinners for their mothers, sisters, and younger brothers, and if they stay in their country they can maybe hope to make $5 a day with back breaking labor.  <br/></p>
<p>We want to change this.  We want these kids growing up in their communities knowing that there are viable opportunities out there for them to succeed.  With Surf Strong, kids will be exposed to our ten fundamental themes with a surfboard tucked under their arm.   Our ten themes; Determination, Courage, Patience, Responsibility, Respect, Self-Control, Integrity, Understanding, Kindness, and Humility; are key for every child's success.</p>

</div></div>","Hola! Bienvenidos! Welcome! Thank you for watching our video for Surf Strong.  We are Sarah and Jerson, and we have started Surf Strong to help a small community in El Salvador, where young kids often have very little parental involvement and limited opportunity.  These kids spend a lot of time in the streets with negative influences and not enough to do, where they develop toxic friendships.  They ultimately become consumed within the circle of extreme poverty so widespread within El Salvador.  To escape this circle, parents and families often encourage their young children to make the dangerous migration to the United States to earn money and provide for the family illegally.  To these families, it is a choice between life and death; there is no other choice for their youth.
Surf Strong is designed to provide an alternative.  We will provide a safe, positive environment in these kids' lives through a connection to surfing.  Through Surf Strong, the children will have access to surf boards and lessons, as well as lessons in English, photography, business, and more.  With their growing connection to the beach, they will develop a sense of pride in the beautiful place they come from, and they will learn to take responsibility for their home, their actions, and their futures as they develop confidence and skills that will translate to all aspects of life. 
Surf Strong is working to develop the next generation, of strong, confident, and capable leaders, and we need your help.  We are designed to be sustainable, however we need to raise our start-up funds.  Once we are off the  ground, we will be able to maintain our programs, only fundraising for expansion endeavors.  For every $200 raised, we can reach about 10 more kids per week...this week, next week, and every week after that.  Over the course of five years, that same $200 will still be helping kids!
  What We Need & What You Get

We need surfboards!  Ten softtop longboards to be exact, although the more we have, the more kids we can help.  Additionally, as the kids get better, they will move to standard shortboards, which we can buy used off of tourists looking to sell their boards quickly.  The longboards cost about $200 each, so we are looking at $2000 upfront in boards and another $1000 as the kids become more advanced.
We also need rashguards!  Rashguards are important, as a surf school without rashguards is like a hockey team without jerseys!  We want the kids to feel like they are a part of something awesome.  For some, this will be the first time in their lives they have something to be proud of.  Rashguards are expensive though, and we are looking at about $800-$1000 for this cost.
Other crucial components include chairs and a canopy tent on the beach, so participants have somewhere safe and fun to hang out while they escape the sun between sessions.  We also need signs to make our organization legitimate.  It isn't much, but culturally, if you have spent even a small amount of money on a sign, you mean serious business.  Total cost, approximately $400.

We are planting a small garden to grow vegetables for lunches!  We will provide a healthy meal to every kid, every day.  Many of these kids beg for food during the day so they can eat at night, and eat little more than beans and tortillas every single day.  The cost of the garden is approximately $150.

Check out the perks to the side to get more information on what we can now afford due to your generous donation!

  The Impact 
 In the United States recently, you may have seen news about growing numbers of unaccompanied minors.  These young kids are mostly from the countries of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala.  The reason is this: THEY HAVE NO CHOICE.
Often times, these kids are targeted by violence, or have become the breadwinners for their mothers, sisters, and younger brothers, and if they stay in their country they can maybe hope to make $5 a day with back breaking labor.  
We want to change this.  We want these kids growing up in their communities knowing that there are viable opportunities out there for them to succeed.  With Surf Strong, kids will be exposed to our ten fundamental themes with a surfboard tucked under their arm.   Our ten themes; Determination, Courage, Patience, Responsibility, Respect, Self-Control, Integrity, Understanding, Kindness, and Humility; are key for every child's success.

Risks & Challenges
Our biggest risk & challenge is if we cannot build our income generating activities (surf lessons for tourists, volunteers, room rentals) before the money runs out.  If this is the case, I will be heading back to the US (and Jerson too if he can get a visa!) to run more fundraisers and save more of my own money to put towards our dream.  Our ideal funding situation is to raise our start-up costs, with an additional $5000 to gain momentum while we build our financial sustainability.     Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you checked your couch cushions and there is no spare change, there are other ways to help.  We are hosting a variety of fundraisers, and we would appreciate every like and share you can throw our way!  Additionally, perhaps your network or connections could help us to lower our costs.  Who do you know who can help?  Find us on facebook at www.facebook.com/surfstrongyouth!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

  Student 1</b>, approached me after learning the <i>Bully Proof</i> system and said
  she no longer wanted “to do it.” When asked what she was referring to, she
  admitted to having a “hit list” and a “gun” in her locker – she said I was
  her hero and asked if I’d go with her while she turned herself in.</p>
<p><b>Student 2</b>, was
  at school one morning clearing out his locker so his dad wouldn’t have to
  after he committed suicide - something he planned to do that very afternoon.
  As he walked by the gymnasium he heard me teaching the <i>Bully Proof</i> system to a large group of students (600+). Intrigued
  by what I was saying he came in and sat down. Afterwards he approached a
  teacher and told of his plans, and said my message had given him hope that he wouldn't be bullied any more. After
  counseling and some family therapy he went on to college.</p>
<p><b>Student 3</b>, came
  to me during a <i>Bully Proof</i>
  presentation and said she was being bullied. She also said the reason why was
  because about a year ago her father had committed suicide. One of the things
  I told her was that she needed new friends, ones that would stand up for her.
  It became my mission that day to find her three (3)
  new, good friends. By the end of the day I had found her fifty-two (52), and
  they had formed a club to help each other through difficult times using the <i>Bully Proof</i> system. Last I heard they
  had over 200 members and began including junior classes; that way the club
  would continue after the original students graduated.</p>

I'm grateful for those experiences. <br/><br/>As an adult, I've inspired many, I've served many, and I continue to base my life around creation, contribution, and service (e.g. I once called a handful of local radio stations and asked everyone listening to bring winter clothing to my place of employment so I could donate clothes to the homeless, and that's just one story). <br/><br/><b>I've helped people launch careers and businesses and communities</b> that would go on to serve many more, creating a ripple effect and contributing to the evolution of our wonderful world. </div>

<div>
<br/>I need to create/raise $6,000 (CAD) in order to attend this retreat on April 24th, 2015. The money you contribute to my campaign will go towards helping me create the following: <br/><br/><ul>
<li>The retreat experience, which includes life-coaching, group experiences, business/career coaching to make career changes/build a new business/increase the purpose of my business, excursions, food, meditation, yoga, and reflective exercises and materials. </li>
<li>The upgrading of my skills, wisdom, and experience as a coach and as a being, which will allow me to serve YOU and others more powerfully.<br/>
</li>
<li>A dream come true - because let's face it, I'm not dying or getting married (yet), or going to build schools in less fortunate countries, or feeding the homeless (though I have and I will continue to do so), but all these things can and will happen, and this is a valuable piece of the puzzle.</li>
</ul>
<b><h3><br/></h3>
<h3>PERKS!!!</h3></b>The perks I'm offering include <b>virtual coaching sessions</b>, where you will get to experience the power of my work first-hand, and if you've watched the video and read the perks, you know what kinda of transformation is possible in a single conversation. Also, I'm offering  a <b>special shout-out in my victory video </b>to those of you who contribute, AND I've added a bit of a wacky, wild, and hilarious bonus... YOU READY!?<br/><br/>If I raise $6000 before or by the final date, I will show-up to the <b>MTS Centre</b> in downtown Winnipeg, on Saturday, April 11th at 1:00PM, tunes in tow, and I will bare it all for Bali! Picture me in my <b>Winnipeg Jets underwear</b>, the middle of downtown Winnipeg, dropping it like it's hot to Pharell's ""Happy"", Timbaland's ""Pass At Me"" or Kim Cesarion's ""Undressed"".... <br/><br/>LOL! Uh. Wait. That came out wrong... Anywho! This just goes to show how crazy-committed I am to conquering this courageous challenge.</div>
<div>Oh, AND I'll get the dance on video and upload it, for those of you who can't make it out that day. <br/><br/>AND! Even if I don't quite reach my entire goal, the funds will still go towards the Bali Retreat. I expect challenges to arise, and I've prepared for them by reaching out to other contributors, creating a local fundraising event, and coaching/serving my butt off.<br/><br/>
</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Picture this:</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> I sit down with a young man or woman whose goal is to create a community or a business or a life that will allow them to help and serve others, and to positively impact the world, but their fears and limiting beliefs are preventing them from taking action. They seek my help, and through the work that I do, they're able to bust through all of that and take action, which results in a a business or a community that now serves dozens, and hundreds, and thousands of other people. <br/>I believe I'm good at what I do - it's more who I AM than what I do -  and I could be GREAT. I WILL be GREAT. </span>
</div>
<div>My growth and transformation began the moment I committed to this experience, and it will continue. Your contribution of $25, $60, $100, or more, goes towards helping me create this Bali Retreat, which results in more powerful coaching and service, and more of the change you seek - more of the change WE seek - within ourselves and within the world.<br/><br/>Your generosity and contribution is appreciated and will not be forgotten or squandered. I will continue to pay-it-forward, contribute frequently, and serve always - as I have in previous times. </div>

</div></div>","Who? - I'm a fire-starter, a transformational coach, a style junkie, and a miracle worker - I connect with people, I have powerful conversations with them, and their lives are miraculously transformed. 



I'm a son, a brother, an uncle, and a man with a dream - like  many of you. I was the kid who setup lemonade stands, had mini yard-sales, and held car washes in wigs and dresses to create money, because I knew my parents didn't always have it to give, and because it was fun. I'm grateful for those experiences. As an adult, I've inspired many, I've served many, and I continue to base my life around creation, contribution, and service (e.g. I once called a handful of local radio stations and asked everyone listening to bring winter clothing to my place of employment so I could donate clothes to the homeless, and that's just one story). I've helped people launch careers and businesses and communities that would go on to serve many more, creating a ripple effect and contributing to the evolution of our wonderful world. 


Why? - Have you ever dreamed of something more, but found yourself too afraid (judgement, failure, success) to take a leap into uncertainty and risk it all. ""But what if I fail?"" But what if you don't...



You know when you see someone do something bold and crazy, and you light up inside. You're inspired in that moment, and you think to yourself ""Man, I wish I had the guts to do ______ (e.g. chase your dreams, dance like nobody's watching, leap before you're ready)!"" I wished I did to, and then I did it. That's what this is about. 
I'm doing it, but I need your help beloved. I'm asking for your help in creating an experience that I believe with all of my heart will create a ripple effect, as all actions do. In contributing to me, you are also contributing to you, and to the many others I will go onto serve through my work. 

This isn't about vacation - so far, nothing about this experience has been relaxing. In fact, if one were looking for a ""vacation"" I'd probably look elsewhere - I've never felt more uncomfortable, and it's never felt more worth it.This is about transformation, and the transformation has already begun, and in the last month alone, I've served a number of people through my work - people with a mission like my own. A mission to serve the masses.  And I'm just getting started.
   What I Need & What You Get

I need to create/raise $6,000 (CAD) in order to attend this retreat on April 24th, 2015. The money you contribute to my campaign will go towards helping me create the following: 
The retreat experience, which includes life-coaching, group experiences, business/career coaching to make career changes/build a new business/increase the purpose of my business, excursions, food, meditation, yoga, and reflective exercises and materials. 
The upgrading of my skills, wisdom, and experience as a coach and as a being, which will allow me to serve YOU and others more powerfully.

A dream come true - because let's face it, I'm not dying or getting married (yet), or going to build schools in less fortunate countries, or feeding the homeless (though I have and I will continue to do so), but all these things can and will happen, and this is a valuable piece of the puzzle.


PERKS!!!The perks I'm offering include virtual coaching sessions, where you will get to experience the power of my work first-hand, and if you've watched the video and read the perks, you know what kinda of transformation is possible in a single conversation. Also, I'm offering  a special shout-out in my victory video to those of you who contribute, AND I've added a bit of a wacky, wild, and hilarious bonus... YOU READY!?If I raise $6000 before or by the final date, I will show-up to the MTS Centre in downtown Winnipeg, on Saturday, April 11th at 1:00PM, tunes in tow, and I will bare it all for Bali! Picture me in my Winnipeg Jets underwear, the middle of downtown Winnipeg, dropping it like it's hot to Pharell's ""Happy"", Timbaland's ""Pass At Me"" or Kim Cesarion's ""Undressed"".... LOL! Uh. Wait. That came out wrong... Anywho! This just goes to show how crazy-committed I am to conquering this courageous challenge.
Oh, AND I'll get the dance on video and upload it, for those of you who can't make it out that day. AND! Even if I don't quite reach my entire goal, the funds will still go towards the Bali Retreat. I expect challenges to arise, and I've prepared for them by reaching out to other contributors, creating a local fundraising event, and coaching/serving my butt off.

    The Impact

Picture this: I sit down with a young man or woman whose goal is to create a community or a business or a life that will allow them to help and serve others, and to positively impact the world, but their fears and limiting beliefs are preventing them from taking action. They seek my help, and through the work that I do, they're able to bust through all of that and take action, which results in a a business or a community that now serves dozens, and hundreds, and thousands of other people. I believe I'm good at what I do - it's more who I AM than what I do -  and I could be GREAT. I WILL be GREAT. 

My growth and transformation began the moment I committed to this experience, and it will continue. Your contribution of $25, $60, $100, or more, goes towards helping me create this Bali Retreat, which results in more powerful coaching and service, and more of the change you seek - more of the change WE seek - within ourselves and within the world.Your generosity and contribution is appreciated and will not be forgotten or squandered. I will continue to pay-it-forward, contribute frequently, and serve always - as I have in previous times.

<p>My name is Ernie and I
am a regular and normal guy living in a small town: Calexico, California. I
was alarmed when read a report of how many kids are reported missing every
year: 800,000 ! Like 2,000 kids a day!!! I served 2 years as treasurer in the
local chapter for a national nonprofit organization (Elks) , and actual
secretary on a local nonprofit (Calexico Baja Runners).</p>
<p>Our campaign is based
on the right that every kid deserves to be happy and free. We want to provide
with one GPS tracking wrist watch to 10,000 kids in America. Our goal is to
raise funds and donate the GPS watch to local, state and nationwide
organizations such as: The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children,
Child Help, Shared Hope International and National Autism Association, to
mention a few. We planned to donate to your local missing kids and autism
chapters, also. We will be open for your suggestions on that.</p><p></p><p>                                                                </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/519628/files/20140419124051-Untitled.jpg?1397936451"" src="""" style=""width: 294.3649635036497px; height: 142px;""/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">   </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/512733/files/20140416073752-arrow.jpg?1397659072"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; width: 281.3435114503817px; height: 136px;""/></p><p></p><p></p>

the child permanently.</p>

</p><p><b>Missing Children with Autism</b></p>

wander, or elope, from safe environments. And more than one-third of children

child with autism presents unique and difficult challenges for families, law
enforcement, first responders and search teams. The National Center for Missing
&amp; Exploited Children has special search protocols and checklists to help
first responders.</p>
<p>Children with autism
go missing under a variety of circumstances. They may seek out small or
enclosed spaces. They may wander toward places of special interest to them. Or
they may try to escape overwhelming stimuli such as sights, sounds,
surroundings or activities of others.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Attraction to water</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Children with autism
often have an extremely high attraction to water. Because of this we strongly
recommend first responders and search teams immediately check all nearby bodies
of water in an effort to head-off the child. These bodies of water include but
are not limited to streams, ponds, lakes, rivers, creeks, storm-water
retention/detention basins and swimming pools.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/512736/files/20140416073916-arrow.jpg?1397659156"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

We both share a desire to see God glorified through people of all nations turning to him. With an understanding of the weight of the Great Commission and a statistical knowledge of those who have yet to hear the name of Jesus, we are academically equipping ourselves for a life of ministry we have been called to. The benefits of in-class learning are huge, but it is now time integrate what we have learned (thus far) into a “hands-on” experience on the mission field.</p><p>This year, we have been blessed with the opportunity to be a part of Cru (Campus Crusades for Christ), which is a campus-wide discipleship ministry. Through this organization we have been invited to join a group of about twelve other students to embark on a journey to Central Asia. As a whole, this region is heavily influenced by the Islamic religion and is in desperate need of the Gospel. We will be building relationships, primarily on a college campus, through English language cafes. We are praying these relationships lead to (or are formed around) Gospel conversations causing our friends to put their faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ. Not only do we desire for these specific individuals to direct their worship towards God, the Father of Jesus Christ, but for this to extend to the rest of the surrounding community. Plainly, we long for these new disciples to make disciples who make disciples (and so on). The two of us are completely ecstatic that we get to be a part of what God is doing in Central Asia!

We both share a desire to see God glorified through people of all nations turning to him. With an understanding of the weight of the Great Commission and a statistical knowledge of those who have yet to hear the name of Jesus, we are academically equipping ourselves for a life of ministry we have been called to. The benefits of in-class learning are huge, but it is now time integrate what we have learned (thus far) into a “hands-on” experience on the mission field.This year, we have been blessed with the opportunity to be a part of Cru (Campus Crusades for Christ), which is a campus-wide discipleship ministry. Through this organization we have been invited to join a group of about twelve other students to embark on a journey to Central Asia. As a whole, this region is heavily influenced by the Islamic religion and is in desperate need of the Gospel. We will be building relationships, primarily on a college campus, through English language cafes. We are praying these relationships lead to (or are formed around) Gospel conversations causing our friends to put their faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ.

<p>My name is Darrien White and I am a student at Pender Early College High School and have worked extremely hard the past 5 years trying to make the most of the Early College program. I pushed as hard as I could and intend on graduating this semester with an Associates in Arts, Associates in Science, and an Associates in General Studies. I am a member of the Phi Theta Kappa Honors Society and have been given the opportunity to attend the International Scholar Laureate Program. I would like to attend at least one session if possible with the hope of learning more about business and establishing connections in an area outside the U.S. I believe if i can attend the International Scholar Laureate Program, I will learn as much as I can to help further my career in International Business.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">I would like to go to China and some other destinations in the USA both trips together will cost $4,290. Any and all donations will be going straight to the application fee and tuition cost. If for some reason we aren't able to reach the goal, the funds will still be used wisely. I am getting ready to transfer to a four year university and will still need the help. As far as what you can get in return this is what I can do. If you are a local business owner and donate one of the allotted amount setup up through the perks I will make a T-shirt with your provided logo and information to advertise for you while I am traveling. </span></span>

<h3>The Impact</h3></span></h3><p></p><p>This program will be an awesome learning experience. It goes hand in hand with my intended major and it would be a great honor.  I have participated in many leadership building camps  while attending Pender Early College. I will engage myself to the fullest if granted the opportunity to attend the International Scholar Laureate Program. With the knowledge I gain from my experience, I will work diligently at my studies.</p><p>My dream is to start my own car manufacturing company that focuses on fuel efficiency.  This focus will finally allow the US to compete with Europe's fuel efficiency, Also,  I intend on helping my friends start businesses of their own ranging from cartoon production to jewelry manufacturing.<br/></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Please help me spread this campaign like wild fire.

<p></p></div>","Short Summary
My name is Darrien White and I am a student at Pender Early College High School and have worked extremely hard the past 5 years trying to make the most of the Early College program. I pushed as hard as I could and intend on graduating this semester with an Associates in Arts, Associates in Science, and an Associates in General Studies. I am a member of the Phi Theta Kappa Honors Society and have been given the opportunity to attend the International Scholar Laureate Program. I would like to attend at least one session if possible with the hope of learning more about business and establishing connections in an area outside the U.S. I believe if i can attend the International Scholar Laureate Program, I will learn as much as I can to help further my career in International Business.

What We Need & What You Get
I would like to go to China and some other destinations in the USA both trips together will cost $4,290. Any and all donations will be going straight to the application fee and tuition cost. If for some reason we aren't able to reach the goal, the funds will still be used wisely. I am getting ready to transfer to a four year university and will still need the help. As far as what you can get in return this is what I can do. If you are a local business owner and donate one of the allotted amount setup up through the perks I will make a T-shirt with your provided logo and information to advertise for you while I am traveling. 
1. Donate.2. Send me an email with your business logo and contact information.3. I advertise for you.My email is darrienwhite@aol.com or darrien_white@gmail.com

The ImpactThis program will be an awesome learning experience. It goes hand in hand with my intended major and it would be a great honor.  I have participated in many leadership building camps  while attending Pender Early College. I will engage myself to the fullest if granted the opportunity to attend the International Scholar Laureate Program. With the knowledge I gain from my experience, I will work diligently at my studies.My dream is to start my own car manufacturing company that focuses on fuel efficiency.  This focus will finally allow the US to compete with Europe's fuel efficiency, Also,  I intend on helping my friends start businesses of their own ranging from cartoon production to jewelry manufacturing.Other Ways You Can HelpPlease help me spread this campaign like wild fire. I want your mom to know about it. I want you dad to know about it. I want everyone on the planet to know about this campaign. Please help me get out to see the world and learn while I do it.This is a link to the main site: http://www.scholarlaureate.org/Some other things I've done:
I put all of this up to show that I am motivated and will go all out in the program while doing all I can to be a good delegate, student, and representative for my family and former schools.

He did not attend school and often had no money to feed himself. Thankfully after a year or so he was found by a street educator from <a href=""http://childhope.hope.org.ph/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Child Hope Asia</a>, who guided him through the dark nights. Daniel learnt that by focusing on positives  it is possible to change your life, and so he did.</p><p>Daniel returned home and started to attend school. He stayed with Child Hope throughout his studies until grade six, when he was discovered by <a href=""http://kidzinaction.wordpress.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">KIA (Kidz In Action)</a> in 2011. At that time KIA was looking for children for its pioneer batch, and Daniel perfectly fitted in: he was compassionate, intelligent, responsible, wholehearted and kind. Working hard at KIA (and everywhere else) he earned a full scholarship at<a href=""http://www.ais.edu.ph/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aguinaldo International School</a>.</p><p>Daniel excelled at high school: he played the lead role in two different school musicals, maintained consistently excellent grades, established life-long friendships with people from very different backgrounds and graduated this year with his school’s top leadership award.</p><p>Since graduating from Aguinaldo, Daniel has gained a full scholarship to complete his <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IB_Diploma_Programme"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">International Baccalaureate Diploma</a> at <a href=""http://www.uwcrobertboschcollege.de/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">United World College in Germany</a> where he will represent the Philippines (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaezzd2ZinQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here</a> you can watch a video about UWC).</p><p>(Find more info on Daniel's story on our <a href=""http://kidzinaction.wordpress.com/2014/05/12/beyond-my-dreams/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>)</p><p><b>Why is it important to us?</b></p><p>Daniel has worked incredibly hard to come this far in his life. Through his journey he has managed to break down misconceptions about street children and inspire his peers. He hasn't forgotten where he came from or about the children who still live on the streets (he regularly participates in community service activities within his former community). </p><p>Daniel is the perfect example that anything is possible when you work hard, don't lose faith and stay persistent. You can dream, you can work and therefore you CAN change your life. </p><p><i>Nelson Mandela said ""Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world"". </i>That’s our philosophy also.

The funds already collected through this site will go towards Daniel's visa and miscellaneous travel expenses. KIA would like to thank all of those who have helped make Daniel's dreams a reality! We are all touched by people's generosity. Please note that any donations above Daniel's need  will be used to support the educational needs of the other KIA kids. For inquires, please contact us at beyondmydreams.daniel@gmail.com.*******************************************************************The story behind When Daniel was eight years old he lived alone on the streets of Manila, selling flowers for a living. He did not attend school and often had no money to feed himself. Thankfully after a year or so he was found by a street educator from Child Hope Asia, who guided him through the dark nights. Daniel learnt that by focusing on positives  it is possible to change your life, and so he did.Daniel returned home and started to attend school. He stayed with Child Hope throughout his studies until grade six, when he was discovered by KIA (Kidz In Action) in 2011. At that time KIA was looking for children for its pioneer batch, and Daniel perfectly fitted in: he was compassionate, intelligent, responsible, wholehearted and kind. Working hard at KIA (and everywhere else) he earned a full scholarship atAguinaldo International School.Daniel excelled at high school: he played the lead role in two different school musicals, maintained consistently excellent grades, established life-long friendships with people from very different backgrounds and graduated this year with his school’s top leadership award.Since graduating from Aguinaldo, Daniel has gained a full scholarship to complete his International Baccalaureate Diploma at United World College in Germany where he will represent the Philippines (Here you can watch a video about UWC).(Find more info on Daniel's story on our website)Why is it important to us?Daniel has worked incredibly hard to come this far in his life. Through his journey he has managed to break down misconceptions about street children and inspire his peers. He hasn't forgotten where he came from or about the children who still live on the streets (he regularly participates in community service activities within his former community). Daniel is the perfect example that anything is possible when you work hard, don't lose faith and stay persistent. You can dream, you can work and therefore you CAN change your life. Nelson Mandela said ""Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world"". That’s our philosophy also. And we believe in Daniel. Giving Daniel the chance to go to Robert Bosch UWC in Germany where he will take part in one of humanity's finest endeavors, the UWC movement, would provide him opportunities to learn and grow as an individual. With all that experience and inspiration, he could truly make a change in his country. “It is important to me, because I can learn new skills that will help me to help other street children when I come back to the Philippines” – as Daniel said. (Watch Daniel's video here)Daniel’s villageAs the proverb says ""It takes a village to raise a child"". Daniel has a wonderful village consisting of his own family, his various street educators and his social workers throughout the year, the organizations he was or is still part of (ChildHope Asia and KIA), the teachers and mentor at Aguinaldo International School and his friends. And now you can be part of his ‘village’ by helping him to get to UWC and start his adventures in Europe. Why we campaign? What we need to raise funds for? This campaign is to raise funds for Daniel's travel expenses to Germany. He needs a ticket to get to Freiburg (approx. 1000 USD), to come back to the Philippines after his first school year (approx. 1500 USD) and to return at the end (approx. 1800 USD). The impactThe impact you can have is outstanding!

I hold a belief that volunteering can be and should be improved and by that I know I have to walk out of Taiwan and learn how I can change volunteering in Taiwan better by working with different people, different volunteer teams and embracing different ideas.

</div><h2><b>Summary</b></h2><p>We are an independent, Chicago-centric non-profit organization. We aim to train and mentor young journalists to cover the important issues weighing on today’s youth. We believe we have the ability, through strategic partnerships, to push forward the conversation on youth issues while holding the most powerful institutions accountable. Whether it’s juvenile justice or immigration, health or education, LGBTQ or poverty, this endeavor requires the voices of people from all walks of life. If you feel strongly about our mission, about innovative watchdog journalism and about giving a boost to the voice of young people, please consider donating.<br/></p><h2><b>Our Story</b></h2><p>The mission of <a href=""www.chicago-bureau.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Chicago Bureau</a> is to examine the policies that impact the generation growing up now, and investigate whether these policies benefit or hold down the promise of our youth.</p><p>We need your help.</p><p>The Bureau, which is a media site as well as a mentoring and education program, was founded two years ago by journalist and teacher Eric Ferkenhoff, who formerly worked in a home for abused youth and went on to a journalism career where he mostly covered criminal justice and education. </p><p>That experience, combined with teaching at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, prompted Ferkenhoff in 2012 to launch a the Bureau with the idea that a public site would not only shed light on the problems facing and troubling our youth in Chicago and elsewhere - but also to give a platform to younger, aspiring journalists whose work was often graded in class but never got widespread circulation. </p><p>So Ferkenhoff combined his interest in juvenile justice and the want to see his students published and build a portfolio to enhance their career possibilities into what The Chicago Bureau is now.</p><p>Hear Ferkenhoff, managing editor Carter Sherman and writer Alex Nitkin talk to WGN Radio about how The Chicago Bureau got started, what we cover and what the future holds <a href=""http://wgnradio.com/2014/07/15/the-chicago-bureau-shining-light-on-chicagos-under-represented-neighborhoods/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p><p>The Bureau is based at Medill, and receives in-kind support, such as office space, from the school, but must raise the money to operate on its own.

We aim to train and mentor young journalists to cover the important issues weighing on today’s youth. We believe we have the ability, through strategic partnerships, to push forward the conversation on youth issues while holding the most powerful institutions accountable. Whether it’s juvenile justice or immigration, health or education, LGBTQ or poverty, this endeavor requires the voices of people from all walks of life. If you feel strongly about our mission, about innovative watchdog journalism and about giving a boost to the voice of young people, please consider donating.Our StoryThe mission of The Chicago Bureau is to examine the policies that impact the generation growing up now, and investigate whether these policies benefit or hold down the promise of our youth.We need your help.The Bureau, which is a media site as well as a mentoring and education program, was founded two years ago by journalist and teacher Eric Ferkenhoff, who formerly worked in a home for abused youth and went on to a journalism career where he mostly covered criminal justice and education. That experience, combined with teaching at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, prompted Ferkenhoff in 2012 to launch a the Bureau with the idea that a public site would not only shed light on the problems facing and troubling our youth in Chicago and elsewhere - but also to give a platform to younger, aspiring journalists whose work was often graded in class but never got widespread circulation. So Ferkenhoff combined his interest in juvenile justice and the want to see his students published and build a portfolio to enhance their career possibilities into what The Chicago Bureau is now.Hear Ferkenhoff, managing editor Carter Sherman and writer Alex Nitkin talk to WGN Radio about how The Chicago Bureau got started, what we cover and what the future holds here.The Bureau is based at Medill, and receives in-kind support, such as office space, from the school, but must raise the money to operate on its own. And currently, we are stretched quite thin and risk going dark as a site for youth issues and youth voices.Last year, we were fortunate to get entry into the Investigative News Network, a consortium of news sites around the nation - as well as receive a starter grant from the McCormick Foundation. Their generosity has resulted in more than 500 stories being published under some 80 student bylines in various media and exploring issues from juvenile life without parole, the sex trafficking of children, Chicago's struggling education system, youth homelessness and efforts to reverse decades of harsh penalties against juveniles and implement restorative justice more broadly.Ronnie Reese and Kristofor Husted's short documentary, ""Love, Dad,"" follows career criminal James Gardner as he attempts to re-connect and re-enter his family after nearly 30 years of incarceration. Read the full story here.Nearly every story has been student-produced and some of our top editors are students who work under the supervision of professors and professionals.But again, we need help as the next step for the Bureau is to take this education model to the community - mostly underserved and underrepresented areas where the voice of youth needs to be heard most.The value of our country, its success or failure to live up to potential that is so great, depends on educating and providing circumstances where youth of all colors, ethnicities, backgrounds and economic status can thrive.At the Bureau, we intend on examining this effort through more stories, an online magazine to launch in the fall, and through educational workshops. We have created an educational ladder where different levels of students mentor younger students to boost their journalism skills and teach them the workings of institutions they might face - and whose powers they will likely inherit as adults.In effect, the new program, which involves paid internships, will allow us to capture the real voice of youth, all the while 'exporting' parts of one of the top journalism programs in the world to communities that perhaps could never afford or imagine such an education.What We NeedWe are in need of $10,000 in generous support to continue running the program in the short term while we explore many different ways of becoming self-sustaining, through advertising, events, etc., so that we're not always knocking on the doors of generous people like you or foundations.

<p>In September 2013, Esther Cameron and Stephanie Hines received funding from the University of York, in order to go to Luanda and set up what is now Luanda Links. The communities there spoke out about the financial obstacles in the path of young women seeking education. Girls with real promise but no means of funding their education. Parish and Subparish Committee meetings were held to discuss
how a sponsorship scheme could benefit the girls. Boarding school provided the best all round educational opportunity, including regular meals, an aspirational, supportive peer group and freedom from an exhausting daily walk.</p>
<p>But, this
isn’t just a race to educate. We’re thinking bigger.</p>
<p>This is
also a race:</p>
<p>- to <b>FACILITATE</b> the opportunity for girls to
shape their own futures and be autonomous.<br/>
- to <b>CREATE</b> links between secondary school aged girls
in Luanda and the UK so that they can learn
from each other.<br/>
- to <b>CAPTIVATE</b> you with the story of our young women.</p>
<p><b>Malala Yousafzai </b>states that <i>“one child, one book, one teacher and one
pen can change the world”.</i> Luanda Links is joining the fight to transform
this <b>‘can’</b> into a <b>‘will’</b>. This race creates the chance to be a voice for Imelda,
Sharon, Mercy, Diana and Josephine to change the future. <b>A team of
15 runners </b>is currently training hard to prepare for the Wimbledon Common Half Marathon which is
taking place on <b><u>Sunday

<h3><b>Why We Need Your Help</b></h3>
<p><b>We have already kept the girls in school for almost one year</b>. Our
goal is to raise £2500 to keep the five wonderful girls, currently boarding at
St. Bakhita's, exactly where they are. Any money we raise - whether the full
amount or only part of it - will go towards the girls' boarding costs, school
fees, textbooks, uniform and educational materials, all of
which are vital for the girls to reach their potential and make the most of the
education they receive.</p>
<h3><b>The Impact</b></h3>

<p>Our aims are ambitious yet achievable. We endeavour to focus our

girls will ensure that in the long term they can maintain and increase their
chances of a better future.</p>
<p></p><h3><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></h3><span>Luanda Links' aim to instigate small,

We than realised: ""This is useful all over the world!So with volunteers we got to work. And with result! One of our volunteers got nominated for the United Nations Online Volunteering Award.We invested money in the above video. Please watch it. It explains what we do really well. It's our first step to go global! Please support our growth. What We Need & What You GetWe want to become active in at least 20 new countries. Each new country will be supported from ""HQ"". This brings along costs of course. This is where you come in. If you like our project, please help us convince people around you to financially support us.

</h3><h2>$20 = teaching 1 girl about Engineering</h2>
<h2>

$500 = expanding GEC to 1
new City
</h2> <p></p>
<p>The idea is simple: teach young girls
how to impact the world through STEM fields by actually letting them do it.
Girls Engineering Change seeks to close the gender gap in science, technology,
engineering and mathematics by encouraging girls through the construction of
engineered products and connecting them to a network of college mentors who
help them throughout their education. Our curriculum enables middle and high
school girls to build a tangible product to be used in developing world
nations. Our theory of change resides in tackling the two main problems which
prevent girls from studying engineering in the first place: lack of understanding
and lack of encouragement. Our method attempts to tackle both of these issues
and inspire students to challenge these conceptions. </p>
<p>Currently, GEC has reached over 500
girls, primarily central North Carolina. These young girls partner with
university students who take them through a one day session of their choice to
expose them into engineering fundamentals. First, a presentation exposes girls
of the various types of engineering, what their professions entail, and exposes
them to how they can solve major global issues through engineering including
global health, clean water, or green energy. Then, they are paired with a
college mentor who helps them construct different devices. The presenters
explain where their product will go and how it will be used to help someone
somewhere in the world. </p>
<p>Currently, girls are able to construct
a solar powered USB charger which is donated to the Red Cross for use in
disaster relief settings, ECG Simulators which are donated to Engineering World
Health, and a calculator for low resource schools. Girls are encouraged to
explore multiple sessions to gain exposure to more mentors and more issues they
can address. Mostly, our sessions seek to show girls that they, with just a
little guidance, can create a product that will help change the world. With
some encouragement and smiles along the way, Girls Engineering Change closes
the stigmas and barriers that prevent girls from engaging in STEM fields when
they reach college. </p>
<p></p> </div><br/><div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>We at GEC have already introduced
multiple successful and sustainable projects in select locations around the
country, and so are looking to expand further. These new chapters will allow
more girls to learn about engineering, and will push to involve their
communities in the education process.</p>
With that being said, we
have also had difficulty with chapters being sustainable beyond a few
sessions.<span>  Over the past year, we
have developed a curriculum for new chapters to establish themselves and gain
traction within their community. 
Since the completion of this curriculum, however, no new GEC chapters
have been created.  We are
confident that with careful selection of chapter leadership and regular
communication from our executive board the curriculum will prove effective in
creating sustainable chapters around the country.</span>

<p></p>
<p>Part of why I came here to help was to raise money in order to enhance the quality of life for the children of the Victor Hugo Manjushree Vidyapith School.</p>
<p>Travel is an amazing way to educate children, let alone offer them an insight into another part of the world that can enrich their lives and understanding of their surroundings.</p>
<p>During their next school holiday which will be in
January 2015, I want to provide the final year students (class 8 who are 13 and 14 years old) with an exciting opportunity that so many of us take for granted - the opportunity to travel. I feel this will be an invaluable experience for them and a chance for them to explore their fascinating country.</p>
<p>We would like for them to travel, accompanied by 4 adults, from Kathmandu, down
to Chitwafn (Nepal’s first ever National Park, S.Nepal), then across to Pokhara
(a city situated in the center of Nepal, known for its beautiful lake, its close proximity to some of the world's best trekking routes, and spectacular views of the Himalayas).</p>

<p>Pramod is the director and owner of the VHMaVi, and of a travel tourism agency , Mandap Travels, that helps fund the school. Pramod has calculated the cost of the trip will be £1980 (2500 euros). </p>
<p>This will pay for: </p>

<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Travel (by bus) to and from all destinations</span><br/>

</ul>
<p>Travelling is an amazing way of broadening one’s mind, heightening aspirations, developing one’s
independence and self-confidence, and enlightenment. I believe that travelling
is one of the most invaluable, and yet underrated forms of education there is, but
sadly not everyone gets this opportunity, whether it be exploring one’s own
country, or travelling into foreign territory. We would like to give the children the opportunity to broaden their experiences and discover more of the history, the hills and the monuments of their incredible country.</p>

</div></div>","Do you remember when you were at school? Did you get to go on trips around the country, maybe even the world? Travel is a great way to educate, it’s a great learning tool for underprivileged children who don’t normally get the opportunity to.Can you help us raise enough money to give these children a once in a lifetime opportunity to travel out of their village and experience something new?My name is Charlotte Sheldrake,  I’m 24 years old and I am a volunteer at Victor Hugo Manjushree Vidyapith School (VHMaVi) in Chapali, 20km north of Kathmandu, Nepal.At VHMaVi (non-profit organisation), we offer a private education which currently welcomes 146 students, most of whom come from poor families who cannot afford to pay the school fees.(Above: a volunteer taking a yoga class)
(Above: Pramod (left) and Saru (right) - the A-team running the school) 


Part of why I came here to help was to raise money in order to enhance the quality of life for the children of the Victor Hugo Manjushree Vidyapith School.
Travel is an amazing way to educate children, let alone offer them an insight into another part of the world that can enrich their lives and understanding of their surroundings.
During their next school holiday which will be in
January 2015, I want to provide the final year students (class 8 who are 13 and 14 years old) with an exciting opportunity that so many of us take for granted - the opportunity to travel. I feel this will be an invaluable experience for them and a chance for them to explore their fascinating country.
We would like for them to travel, accompanied by 4 adults, from Kathmandu, down
to Chitwafn (Nepal’s first ever National Park, S.Nepal), then across to Pokhara
(a city situated in the center of Nepal, known for its beautiful lake, its close proximity to some of the world's best trekking routes, and spectacular views of the Himalayas).


Pramod is the director and owner of the VHMaVi, and of a travel tourism agency , Mandap Travels, that helps fund the school. Pramod has calculated the cost of the trip will be £1980 (2500 euros). 
This will pay for: 


Travel (by bus) to and from all destinations

Chitwan: Accommodation, safaris/cultural activities, food
Pokhara: Accommodation, cultural/recreational activities, food

Travelling is an amazing way of broadening one’s mind, heightening aspirations, developing one’s
independence and self-confidence, and enlightenment. I believe that travelling
is one of the most invaluable, and yet underrated forms of education there is, but
sadly not everyone gets this opportunity, whether it be exploring one’s own
country, or travelling into foreign territory. We would like to give the children the opportunity to broaden their experiences and discover more of the history, the hills and the monuments of their incredible country.
There is of course a possibility that we will not
reach our target for this campaign, however this will not alter or hinder the
project. We will simply postpone the trip and continue to fundraise until we
have enough funds to send the children on a journey they’ll never forget.
If you cannot contribute financially to this
project, you can still help by sharing my campaign within your network using
the Indiegogo sharing tools. 
Please help me to provide the children of Class 8
with a once in a lifetime opportunity.
Thank you,

 Hey Everyone!
As some of you may or may not know, I'm back in the states and ready to run another race: My first sprint triathlon will be on Sunday, September 7th, 2014 in colonial Williamsburg, Virginia- home of my alma mater The College of William and Mary. Go Tribe!
Completed Races for Baruyan:



 September 2009: Completed Maymont Cross Country Festival half-marathon, Richmond, Virginia

October 2009: Charlottesville's Fall Classic 10k, Charlottesville, Virginia
November 2009: 5k Turkey Trot- Charlottesville, Virginia

June 2012: Zooma Half-marathon- Annapolis, Maryland
December 2012: San Silvestre Vallecana 10k- Madrid, Spain
October 2013: Holi Run 5K- Madrid, Spain

April 2013: Rock and Roll Marathon- Madrid, Spain

  Why you are more awesome than me:



Donated shoes, books, shirts, and school supplies. 

Raised 
$500/22,072.50 pesos/372.80€ thanks to family and friends. This generous contribution funded Baruyan's sports equipment, summer 
programs, and construction of a volleyball court.
Collaborated with 
TerraCycle and UpCycle Foundation to donate $7,000/309,015 pesos/5.219,20€ worth of school 
supplies made out of recycled goods. 
Raised $2,190/96,677.55 pesos/1.632,86€ thanks to friends and family. This generous contribution is still in progress and will award students who have excelled in the following 
categories: academics, sports, and the arts. The girl and boy selected in each category will receive a scholarship towards their university.


  Make a difference, serve a cause:
 I believe that each child is given a gift. Every child can excel and reach their potential given the support they need and deserve. The money raised will be awarded as a scholarship to children who have excelled in the following areas. The scholarship will help fund their university studies.  
Academics: Knowledge is power. Support the bookworms!

Sports: After all, this is a race. Ready, steady, go!

Arts: To be Picasso...or not to be Picasso. Think outside the box!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My trials and tribulations in my life have been no secret. They have been listened to by many who have had the same struggles. I always felt so alone through my challenges and never saught any help. Until now. I have decided to start a project called We Are More as a way to bring people together. The feeling of shame and disappointment has been taking young lives for far too long and WE need to stop it. This generation is done watching low self esteem and ridicule take the lives of beautiful peers. WE have had enough.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have put together a business plan so that I can figure out what exactly it is that we need to launch this organization. My goal is to raise $3500 in the next month. This will cover the purchase of the domain, the orders of merchandise and any other business fees that come up. The merchandise will most certainly be the most costly, but I feel it is of huge importance in order to get the word out. I will have stickers, posters, shirts and wrist bands made immediately. From there I find festivals or bands to tour with. Any money left over will fund the feeding and living arrangements of whoever it is that I decide to send to travel the states and spread the message of We Are More. This person could be YOU. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is a way to step up and make a real change in today's world. The internet has been such an incredible source of community and I think we need to really embrace that. Your story can save the life of someone who feels trapped and alone in their own skin. We Are More is just the beginning. The phrase, ""We Are More"" is an indication that we do not have to fight this world alone. This darkness will pass and we will not be forced to overcome it alone. Even if you don't feel strong enough to share your story with the world, your belief and passion for this project could influence others to speak yup. WE can be the voice of strength. WE can be the voice of embracing our scars and painful pasts. WE will not let the cycle of suicide and self harm win this battle. We Are More together.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You don't have to be an outgoing or crazy loud individual to have your voice heard. Simply wearing a bracelet, and having people ask questions, can change someone's heart. Sharing this organization with others who may have a knack for public speaking could be an incredible way to help. If you do not feel called to work directly with We Are More, you can STILL make a huge impact. Simply wearing the merchandise and getting people curious as to what it's all about can do more good than you'll ever know. You can plant that seed of curiousity and maybe even a seed of hope.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Bethany Evans and I am in 7th grade at Evergreen Community Charter School.  This campaign is for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I don't usually get a chance to travel ANYWHERE.  This is a <em>huge </em>opportunity for me. I will go and learn about the culture and meet people and do service.  I really want to go because I've always wanted to travel to interesting places.  Ghana, Africa is one of the most interesting places I can think of.</p>
<p>Here is our group's web site (it's not quite done, but it has a lot of information already): <a href=""http://goingtoghana.weebly.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://goingtoghana.weebly.com/</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Our whole trip will cost about $4,000 (including airline tickets, lodging, medicine for malaria, and everything else).  I need to raise half of the money on my own.  The other half, my parents and I will earn with the families of the other students by doing different fundraising activities like dances, leaf raking, and parents nights out.  </p>
<p>If you can contribute to the half I am earning, to help me to get to $2,000, it would be so awesome!  I have already raised $564 and I have also saved about $150 on my own.  So my personal fundraising goal is now $1,250 by November 20 (which happens to be my 13th birthday).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This would give me a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  I don't get to travel very often. Even when I do, it's not to <em>Africa</em>!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word! Also if you live in Asheville remember that our group can do odd jobs like yard work. Also sugest projects we can do!  :)</p>

<p>MISSION BRIEFING</p>
<p>June 6th, 1944:</p>
<p>It's 2:00am. A US paratrooper rides aboard a 316th Troop Carrier Squadron C-47 ""Dakota."" Shaking in his boots, nervous of the events that lay ahead of him, the trooper mutters ""37, Whiskey 7"" repetitively. He had been assigned to look for those numbers the previous night, they represented the plane he was to ride into hell and jump out of. As though searching for some sanity and peace of mind, his muttering calmed his nerves. ""Stand Up, Hook Up!"" rattled the troop's trance, and they were all soon up and out. This was D-Day.</p>

<p>70 years after the ""Great Crusade"" to destroy Hitler's Atlantic Wall, the National Warplane Museum intends to re-kindle the history of the Normandy Invasion. Located in Geneseo, New York, the museum is a proud owner of a 1943 Douglas C-47A ""Dakota."" This is no average plane, however, as the NWM's C-47 actually served on D-Day, dropping paratroopers over St. Mere-Eglise, France. The lead plane of the 2nd wave over France, Geneseo's C-47 wore the numbers W7/37, and she still appears that way today.</p>

<p>Founded in 1994, the National Warplane Museum is a non-profit 501c3 organization. The NWM is dedication to the restoration, preservation, maintenance, and flight of WWII era aircraft. Also, the museum strives to recognize all US Military personnel for their service and sacrifices.</p>
<p>The National Warplane Museum intends to travel to Normandy, France for the 2014 D-Day Reunion. To commemorate the 70th Anniversary of the brave Allied Assault into Nazi-Fortress Europe, ""Whiskey 7"" will actually re-enact the 2:00am paratroop jump.

Other uses of money could include a new-more authentic paint job, complete set of paratrooper ""pan"" seats, and radio-operator and navigator's stations. The money would be used to completely restore our C-47 back to it's D-Day configuration, and also allow for maintenance to be continued well into the future.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We at the National Warplane Museum feel that our proposed mission is quite significant to many individuals and also the world as a whole. We are remembering history, re-enacting it so that today's generations will see 1st hand the sacrifices of those gone by. D-Day, perhaps the largest of all allied offenses, represents the ultimate story of courage in the face of evil and tyranny.

<h2>Who we are:</h2>
<p>Ever wanted to live or study abroad?  Ever imagined a trip to a part of the world utterly different from your own?  Perhaps to a place where you could help local groups help themselves, all the while learning about life in different cultures? We imagined and dreamed of these things, too! And now, our college, Roanoke College in Salem, Virginia, is offering us just that opportunity!  The thing is, to participate in the service projects we have planned, we need to raise some money. So here’s our story:</p>
<h2>What we'll be doing:</h2>
<p>In early May, twenty students from RC will be taking off on the journey of a lifetime. As we prepare to leave the comforts of our campus behind we envision the experience that lies ahead: three weeks of incredible travel, service, and learning in Ghana—one of the shining stars of African development. Along with three faculty members we are part of this inaugural trip of what will eventually be a sustainable partnership between Roanoke College and several service organizations doing amazing work in villages around the country.</p>
<p>Through time spent in major cities like Accra and Kumasi, and in rural villages, like Zebilla and Busua, we will see both bustling modern life and the communal aspects of more traditional settings. We will spend a day at the University of Ghana, Legon, sightsee in downtown Accra, experience Kumasi’s Cultural Centre, and explore Ghana’s place in the slave trade as we visit the slave castles of Cape Coast, built by the Portuguese in the 15<sup>th</sup> century. </p>
<p>It is primarily in Zebilla and Busua—both villages where most of the population lives in poverty—where we will engage in our most significant service projects. Through partnerships with Kimoyo (in Zebilla) and Teach on the Beach (in Busua), we will live and work in environs few Americans have or will ever experience.</p>
<p>In Zebilla, we will be doing a variety of service projects such as tree-planting, visiting a one doctor clinic, and helping children with after school activities. The tree planting project is hugely important in that many of the schools in Zebilla are without any source of shade or protection from the heat. As you might imagine the weather conditions are extremely hot! This will dramatically improve learning conditions, by creating a virtual oasis at each school. All we need to do is purchase the trees and get to work! We will also work with the doctor from the local clinic, meet a group of women receiving micro-loans, and do some literacy work with a group of girls in a neighboring village. The reward for this last: an international soccer match with the girls!</p>
<p>Once we arrive in Busua—the last leg of our travels—we will be living at and volunteering with Teach on the Beach. This incredible organization, founded by three young Americans just a few years ago, is committed to changing the world by empowering and inspiring youth in Ghana through education and cultural exchange. TOB provides housing, tuition for secondary school, and mentoring to gifted young Ghanaians who would otherwise have seen the end of their school-days. Additionally, they offer a free afterschool literacy program to Busua’s younger children. In addition to working in their programs, we intend to help TOB set up an internet café with laptops and printers (and all the necessary component!). This, of course, doesn’t come cheap, but would be a tremendous resource for both the high school age students who live there, for the afterschool program, and for the community!</p>
<h2>The difference it will make:</h2>
<p>As college students, this trip really is a once in a lifetime experience to learn extensively about a developing country. With this opportunity and the help of your donations, we as a group have the chance to help create a positive change in Ghana.</p>
<p>Your contribution, no matter how big or small, will help fund this service project. The donations will be used to help collect resources and supplies for our efforts. We thank you for your support and generosity.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Who we are:
Ever wanted to live or study abroad?  Ever imagined a trip to a part of the world utterly different from your own?  Perhaps to a place where you could help local groups help themselves, all the while learning about life in different cultures? We imagined and dreamed of these things, too! And now, our college, Roanoke College in Salem, Virginia, is offering us just that opportunity!  The thing is, to participate in the service projects we have planned, we need to raise some money. So here’s our story:
What we'll be doing:
In early May, twenty students from RC will be taking off on the journey of a lifetime. As we prepare to leave the comforts of our campus behind we envision the experience that lies ahead: three weeks of incredible travel, service, and learning in Ghana—one of the shining stars of African development. Along with three faculty members we are part of this inaugural trip of what will eventually be a sustainable partnership between Roanoke College and several service organizations doing amazing work in villages around the country.
Through time spent in major cities like Accra and Kumasi, and in rural villages, like Zebilla and Busua, we will see both bustling modern life and the communal aspects of more traditional settings. We will spend a day at the University of Ghana, Legon, sightsee in downtown Accra, experience Kumasi’s Cultural Centre, and explore Ghana’s place in the slave trade as we visit the slave castles of Cape Coast, built by the Portuguese in the 15th century. 
It is primarily in Zebilla and Busua—both villages where most of the population lives in poverty—where we will engage in our most significant service projects. Through partnerships with Kimoyo (in Zebilla) and Teach on the Beach (in Busua), we will live and work in environs few Americans have or will ever experience.
In Zebilla, we will be doing a variety of service projects such as tree-planting, visiting a one doctor clinic, and helping children with after school activities. The tree planting project is hugely important in that many of the schools in Zebilla are without any source of shade or protection from the heat.

<p>  I am Coral and I have a super cute bestie named Kelly. Many years ago Kelly and I moved from Chicago to New York City to hit it big and become amazing New Yorkers with that special midwest charm. Kinda worked but we both ended up back in Chicago. Upon my departure I was given a gift certificate for American Airlines which helped fund one of my first trips back to Chicago and have yet to forget that great gift giving.</p>
<p>  When Kelly announced she was accepting Yale's generous offer to let her go to their school I thought to myself, ""Gosh wouldn't it be great if we could get Kelly back to Chicago a lot of times so we didn't miss her as much."" As panic set in about her pending departure I began researching effective and non-creepy ways to let her friends and family come together and give whatever amount they wanted to the Bring Kelly Back Project. Your donation will go toward a surprise gift certificate for an airline company to fly Kelly to see her friends and family. It's that easy!</p>
<p>  So here's your chance! $500 was the minimum goal I could set but I figured, what the hell let's give it a try! If you would rather buy her a cute vintage tea set she will then have to pack, break, and unpack, by all means go ahead. But if you prefer to sacrifice a silly whiskey drink you would be buying her on a night of many whiskey drinks and see her again soon, throw a couple bucks in the pot and email me your name and message to include in her card!</p>
<p>   If you are a stranger and reading this, just know Kelly is a one of a kind lady embarking on a long journey at Yale as a Dramaturgy Graduate student. What is dramaturgy you ask? Look it up because it's awesome and my description will do it no justice. Not only is she smart and ambitious, but she is also a master rapper (Rap name is MC Run-On), a messy eater, a fast reader, very quick, and probably one of the funniest people ever. Thank you!!!</p>

I know that when a few people come together, we can reach out and make a big difference in someone’s life. Let's make this work for this very special family.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi my name is Donovan, I am 15 years old and  I’m in the 9<sup>th</sup> grade. This summer I have been given the lifetime opportunity of traveling to the Maasai-Mara Region of Kenya, on a Me to We Volunteer and Leadership Trip. Me to We has joined forces with Muskoka Woods Camp and together will provide the support and leadership for this lifetime experience.  Muskoka Woods will be offering 2 leadership-training sessions before we head off to Kenya and a 4 day debrief upon our return so that we can learn how to put what we have learned to use in our communities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During my 3 week journey I will have the chance to work first-hand with the community by exploring the local villages, learning about traditional Maasal culture and taking Swahili lessons.  I will help build a school for children who may never have set foot inside a classroom. I will also be working on a community water project, helping to provide clean, safe drinking water for children and families.  I will participate in hands-on workshops and learn about poverty-related issues in Africa. I will also experience the unique Kenyan culture, and demonstrate that youth can be the change in our world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I believe that everybody should have a fair chance to get an education and have the opportunity to excel in whatever they dream to do.  Growing up, I lost my father when I was 9 years old and my older brother has multiple disabilities. Despite all the challenges I’ve had, I’m still very fortunate that I have the support of my mom, that I am getting an education and I hope that this trip will allow me to be able to help someone that is less fortunate than I am.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My participation in the Me to We Volunteer and Leadership Trip depends on if I can raise $5999.00.  (A portion of this total program cost is a contribution to Maasai-Mara) I would like to ask you to sponsor me on my trip. Your generous support with a kind donation is very much appreciated.  No donation is too small.</p>

<p>On August 20, 2012, Dr. Jane Davis, the Stanford-educated Chairperson of the Faculty Senate at Tennessee State University was summarily dismissed from her leadership position by the university President at a Faculty Senate meeting. Dr. Davis' offense had been to publicly protest the administration's improper changing of nearly three hundred student grades from ""incomplete"" to letter grades without consultation with course instructors. </p>
<p> [Links to extensive news coverage appear in the box below this text - click on gray arrows].</p>
<p>Following its own investigation, TSU's AAUP chapter has declared Dr. Davis' summary dismissal to be a plain violation of university policy.</p>
<p>When Dr. Davis sought to speak at the Faculty Senate meeting at which she was dismissed, the university President ordered her arrested. The alleged ""crime"" consisted of refusing to silence herself by refusing to leave the meeting, despite university policy that Faculty Senate meetings are open to all faculty.</p>
<p>Campus police handcuffed Dr. Davis and led her away from the Faculty Senate meeting in a humiliating spectacle. The official criminal charge is ""disorderly conduct."" At Dr. Davis' recent arraignment hearing, the university administration reportedly indicated it will continue with the criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>Only four weeks before Dr. Davis' arrest, the Tennessee Board of Regents Academic Subcouncil flatly rejected a facullty-initiated proposal to provide academic freedom policy protection for faculty speech in the context of shared governance activities, such as participation in activities of a Faculty Senate. Such protective policies have been endorsed by the American Association of University Professors nationally, have been adopted by universities and systems in other states, and had been recommended for adoption in Tennessee by Faculty Senates spanning both the Board of Regents and the University of Tennessee systems.</p>
<p>Your donation in any amount will help defer Dr. Davis' legal expenses and will send an important message of faculty solidarity to the state's political and higher education leaders. If donations exceed Dr. Davis' legal defense requirements, the excess will be contributed to support the legislative and faculty advocacy efforts of the Tennessee chapter of the American Association of University Professors.</p>
<p>This fund-raising campaign was endorsed by the Faculty Senate of East Tennessee State University on September 10, 2012.  </p>
</div></div>","On August 20, 2012, Dr. Jane Davis, the Stanford-educated Chairperson of the Faculty Senate at Tennessee State University was summarily dismissed from her leadership position by the university President at a Faculty Senate meeting. Dr. Davis' offense had been to publicly protest the administration's improper changing of nearly three hundred student grades from ""incomplete"" to letter grades without consultation with course instructors. 
 [Links to extensive news coverage appear in the box below this text - click on gray arrows].
Following its own investigation, TSU's AAUP chapter has declared Dr. Davis' summary dismissal to be a plain violation of university policy.
When Dr. Davis sought to speak at the Faculty Senate meeting at which she was dismissed, the university President ordered her arrested. The alleged ""crime"" consisted of refusing to silence herself by refusing to leave the meeting, despite university policy that Faculty Senate meetings are open to all faculty.
Campus police handcuffed Dr. Davis and led her away from the Faculty Senate meeting in a humiliating spectacle. The official criminal charge is ""disorderly conduct."" At Dr. Davis' recent arraignment hearing, the university administration reportedly indicated it will continue with the criminal prosecution.
Only four weeks before Dr. Davis' arrest, the Tennessee Board of Regents Academic Subcouncil flatly rejected a facullty-initiated proposal to provide academic freedom policy protection for faculty speech in the context of shared governance activities, such as participation in activities of a Faculty Senate. Such protective policies have been endorsed by the American Association of University Professors nationally, have been adopted by universities and systems in other states, and had been recommended for adoption in Tennessee by Faculty Senates spanning both the Board of Regents and the University of Tennessee systems.
Your donation in any amount will help defer Dr. Davis' legal expenses and will send an important message of faculty solidarity to the state's political and higher education leaders. If donations exceed Dr. Davis' legal defense requirements, the excess will be contributed to support the legislative and faculty advocacy efforts of the Tennessee chapter of the American Association of University Professors.

<h3>Kurzbeschreibung</h3>
<ul>
<li>Über die Autorin<br/>Monika wurde als siebtes Kind geboren. Bereits vor ihrer Geburt hatten ihre Eltern drei Kinder verloren. Sie arbeitet als Diplom-Sozialpädagogin, Paar- und Familientherapeutin, Heilpraktikerin, Seminarleiterin und Bewusstseinstrainerin mit sehr vielen Menschen und begleitet dabei auch durch den Schmerz eines Verlustes. Als sehr überraschend und unerwartet ihre siebzehnjährige Tochter tödlich verunglückte, wurde sie unmittelbar mit dem Tod konfrontiert. Seither begleitet sie noch intensiver Menschen, die eine Sehnsucht verspüren, das Mysterium des Lebens und des Todes zu verstehen. Ihre Fähigkeit, ihnen zu helfen, ist außergewöhnlich. Die Kraft und Liebe des Jenseits, ihr eigenes Erleben und das tiefe Verständnis, was der Tod ist, stehen ihr zur Verfügung. Sie unterstützt seit 35 Jahren in allen wichtigen Themen des Lebens, wie Partnerschaft, Kindererziehung, Gesundheit, Erfolg und Erfüllung. Sie ist Gründerin und Autorin von ""Steps to Enlightenment® - Schritte in ein erwachtes Leben"". Monika spricht zu den Herzen. Sie schöpft aus eigener Erfahrung und innerer Weisheit. Sie vertritt eine Spiritualität, die den Herausforderungen des Alltags gewachsen ist. Ihr ist es ein großes Anliegen, dass wir uns mit der Vergänglichkeit auseinander setzen, die Einfachheit und Tiefe des Lebens und des Todes begreifen und dadurch frei werden für unseren einzigartigen Weg.</li>
<li><br/></li>
<li>Eines der Themen, das mir immer wieder begegnet, ist die Bewältigung eines schweren Verlustes. Viele Menschen fühlen sich hilflos und allein gelassen. Dies erzeugt viel Leid und hat große Auswirkungen auf ihr weiteres Leben. Es ist mir deshalb ein großes Anliegen, Hilfestellungen zu geben, mit einem Verlust und der eigenen Sterblichkeit angstfreier umzugehen und den tieferen Sinn im Leben und Sterben für sich zu finden.  <br/>
</li>
<li><br/></li>
<li>Das Buch ist eine Kombination einer authentischen Erzählung und psychologischer und spiritueller Erkenntnisse. Verlage wollen entweder eine Erzählung oder ein Fachbuch. Ich sehe den Wert meines Buches jedoch genau in dieser Kombination. Nur eine Erzählung wäre mir zu wenig und ein theoretisches Buch würde mich nicht interessieren. Deshalb habe ich beschlossen, das Buch selber zu verlegen. Dies bedeutet hohe Kosten an Lektorat, Layout, Druckkosten und Vertrieb. Hierbei ist es wunderbar, wenn ich von Spendern Unterstützung bekomme, damit ein Teil dieser Kosten gedeckt ist und das Buch seinen Weg zum Leser finden kann.<br/>

</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Die Auswirkung</h3>
<ul>
<li>Meine langjährige Arbeit mit Menschen hat immer wieder gezeigt, wie viel Leid unverarbeitete Verluste über Jahre und Generationen hinweg bewirken können. Ebenso, wie Menschen an ihrer Erfahrung wachsen und sie in ein sinnerfülltes Leben integrieren können. Dadurch stellen sie für andere Betroffene - und jeder ist früher oder später betroffen- ein leuchtendes Beispiel und eine große Hilfe dar. Das tiefe Begreifen des Mysteriums von Leben und Tod bedeutet Heilung für die Menschheit.<br/>
</li>
<li>Erwähne ähnliche Projekte, mit denen du in der Vergangenheit erfolgreich warst (wenn zutreffend). Ich habe 2006 ein Training ""Schritte in ein erwachtes Leben - Steps to Enlightenment"" geschrieben und lehre es seither. Es hilft Menschen die Tiefen des Seins zu erfahren und in ihr Leben zu integrieren. Davon gibt es ein Buch und ein Karten-Set.<br/>
</li>
<li><br/></li>
<li>Es ist mir ein Herzensanliegen Menschen auf ihrem Weg zu begleiten, auch durch ihre Nöte,  und sie damit zu unterstützen ihren einzigartigen Weg in einem erfüllten und befreiten Leben zu gehen. <br/>

<p>    Դեպի Վաշինգտոն երկրի մի ծայրից մյուսը ձգվող իմ ճանապարհորդության ընթացքում իմ առաքելությունն է լինելու ամերիկյան հանրությանն իրազեկել այն մասին, թե որքան սխալ են ԱՄՆ կառավարության ներկայացուցիչները մեզ ներկայացնում օտար երկրներում։ Այս ընտրված պաշտոնյաները ապացուցել են, որ նրանք հաճախ այնպիսի խնդիրներ են մտցնում օրակարգ, որոնք հակասության մեջ են ամերիկյան բուն արժեքների հետ։ Այդ պատճառով մենք` ԱՄՆ հասարակությունը, պետք է դատապարտենք օտար երկրներում սեփական շահերը հետապնդելու նպատակով և հաճախ ի վնաս տվյալ երկրի բնակչության կատարվող աճպարարությունները։ Այս տեսակ քաղաքականությունը խոչընդոտում է այդ երկրների հետագա ծաղկումն ու անկախությունը` սերմանելով դառնություն և թշնամություն հասարակ ԱՄՆ քաղաքացիների նկատմամբ, ովքեր ոչ անպայմանորեն խրախուսել կամ անգամ տեղյակ են եղել այդ վնասաբեր ամերիկյան քաղաքական ծրագրերի մասին։ Այդ ամենի հետևանքում, մեզ օտար երկրներում թյուր ներկայացնելու պատճառով մեր կառավարությունը մեզ համար անհարմար և երբեմն անգամ վտանգավոր է դարձրել «Հպարտ եմ ամերիկացի լինելու համար» խոսքերն արտաբերել արտասահմանում ճանապարհորդելիս։</p>
<p>    Վերոնշյալ քաղաքական աճպարարության վերջին օրինակներից է 2013 թ. մարտի 2-ին դրանից 12 օր առաջ տեղի ունեցած ՀՀ նախագահի ընտրության վավերացումը`  գործող նախագահ Սերժ Սարգսյանին վերընտրման կապակցությամբ շնորհավորելով։ Ընտրության ընթացքը ապականված է եղել գործող նախագահի օգտին կատարված բազմաթիվ մանրազնին փաստագրված կեղծիքներով։ Այժմ Սարգսյանն օգտագործում է նախագահ Օբամայի շնորհավորական ուղերձը որպես ապացույց, որ ընտրությունն արդար ու ազատ էր։</p>
<p>    Ինչպես նշել եմ վերը, անկախ երկրում Օբամայի կողմից ընտրակեղծիքի օրինականացման դեմ իմ բողոքն էր դրդապատճառը, որ 2013 թ. մարտի 17–ին սկսեցի հացադուլս։ <a href=""http://www.thetruthmustbetold.com/obama-letter/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Նախագահ Օբամային բաց նամակ եմ գրել</a> սույն թվականի մարտի 2–ին` պահանջելով, որ ետ վերցնի իր շնորհավորանքը. Ճանապարհորդությանս չվացուցակը դեռ պատրաստվում է։ Նվիրատուներին կտեղեկացնեմ մեր ծրագրի այս կարևոր հատվածի վերաբերյալ թարմացումների դեպքում։ Կարևորապես չվացուցակը բաց է առաջարկությունների համար։ Եթե ցանկանաք, որ ճանապարհին այցելեմ նաև ձեր քաղաքը, խնդրւոմ եմ իմաց տվեք, որ ես հնարավորության պարագայում փոփոխություններ մտցնեմ չվացուցակիս մեջ։</p>
<p>    Ես հավատացած եմ, որ այս արդար քայլը վերջակետ կդնի իմ հացադուլին և հուսով եմ, որ կհակի ԱՄՆ կառավարությանը հավատարիմ մնալ ժողովրդավարության հիմնական արժեքներին ոչ միայն ԱՄՆ սահմաններից ներս, այլև դուրս, իսկ ապագայում զերծ մնալ կոռումպացված վարչակարգերին օրինականացնելուց`ելնելով գեթ սեփական նեղ շահերից։</p>

ՄԵԿ ԴՈԼԱՐ ԺՈՂՈՎՐԴԱՎԱՐՈՒԹՅԱՆԸ 
2013 թ. մարտի 17–ից սկսած ես հացադուլի մեջ եմ, որն սկսեցի ԱՄՆ նախագահ Բարաք Օբամային բաց նամակ ուղարկելուց հինգ օր անց։ Նամակով պահանջել եմ, որ նա դադարի Սերժ Սարգսյանին և կոռումպացված վարչակարգերի այլ ղեկավարների սատարարելուց. Իմ բաց նամակին նրա պատասխանը կլինի իմ հացադուլի վերջակետը։ Ես նպատակադրվել եմ ճանապարհորդել Ամերիկայի մի ծայրից մյուսը` Լոս Անջելեսից Վաշինգտոն, հացադուլս Սպիտակ տան առջև շարունակելու նպատակով։
Ծրագրում եմ ճանապարհին կանգ առնել տարբեր քաղաքներում, որպեսզի ամերիկացիներին իրազակեմ, թե ինչպես է ԱՄՆ կառավարությունը աշխարհին սխալ ներկայացնում ԱՄՆ քաղաքացիների արժեքները` ընտրակեղծիքներ քաջալերելով ինքնորոշված երկրներում և հանդուրժելով  ավտորիտար ղեկավարներին։ Իմ այս ուսումնական ուղևորությունը դեպի Վաշինգտոն իրականություն դարձնելու նպատակով խնդրում եմ կատարել եկամտահարկից 1 դոլարի նվիրատվություն, որը խորհրդանշում է մեկ քվե հանուն ժողովրդավարության։ Ես սիրով կընդունեմ նաև $1–ը գերազանցող Ձեր աջակցությունը, քանի որ դա կօգնի նպատակիս ավելի արագ հասնել.
ՄԻ ՔԱՆԻ ԽՈՍՔ ԻՄ ՄԱՍԻՆ
     Ես` Արա Խաչիկի Մանուկյանս, իրավապաշտպան եմ, հետաքննող լրագրող, Շահան Նաթալի ընտանեկան հիմնադրության Արցախի ներկայացուցիչը և Policy Forum Armenia–յի անդամ։ Իմ գործունեության ոլորտներն են, մասնավորապես, մարդկանց թրաֆիքինգը, ապօրինի որդեգրումները, բանակային չարաշահումներն ու կոռուպցիան Հայաստանում, Արցախում և այլուր: Ես ժողովրդավարության և օրենքի իշխանության աներկբա ջատագով եմ։ Գործունեությունս լայնորեն լուսաբանվել և արձագանքվել է «Ազատություն» ռադիոկայանի, «Հետք», «Գեղարդ», «Հրապարակ» և «Լրագիր», The Burbank Leader այլ լրատվամիջոցներով: Ես համահեղինակել եմ «Անապատի գիշերներում» (2006) գիրքն ու համանուն վավերագրական ֆիլմը, որտեղ բացահայտվում է Դուբայում գործող խոշոր թրաֆիքինգային մի ցանց, որում ներգրավված են նաև ՀՀ և ԱՄԷ իրավապահ մարմիններ: 2011 թ. ես հիմնել եմ TheTruthMustBeTold.com բլոգը, որտեղ հրապարակում եմ կառավարական կոռուպցիայի և մարդու իրավունքների խախտումների մասին իմ հոդվածներն ու ուսումնասիրությունները։
    Ներկա դրությամբ ես հացադուլի մեջ եմ, որն սկսել եմ 2013 թ. մարտի 17–ին ի նշան բողոքի ընդդեմ Հայաստանի կոռումպացված ավտորիտար ղեկավար Սերժ Սարգսյանին վերընտրման կապակցությամբ ԱՄՆ նախագահ Բարաք Օբամայի վաղաժամ շնորհավորանքի, որը նա ուղարկեց` անտեսելով ընտրակեղծիքի վերաբերյալ բազմաթիվ փաստերի առկայությունը։
 
ԻՄ ԱՌԱՔԵԼՈՒԹՅՈՒՆԸ
    Որպես Կալիֆորնիայում ծնված ու մեծացած ԱՄՆ քաղաքացի, ես հավատացած եմ, որ իմ քաղաքացիական պարտքն է անել ամեն ինչ, որ մեր նախագահ Բարաք Օբամայի գործողությունները երբեք չխարխլեն մեր հզոր երկրի հիմքում ընկած հիմնարար ժողովրդավարական սկզբունքները, ինչպիսիք են օրենքի իշխանությունը, արդարությունը, հավասարությունը և ժողովրդի քվեն։ 
    Դեպի Վաշինգտոն երկրի մի ծայրից մյուսը ձգվող իմ ճանապարհորդության ընթացքում իմ առաքելությունն է լինելու ամերիկյան հանրությանն իրազեկել այն մասին, թե որքան սխալ են ԱՄՆ կառավարության ներկայացուցիչները մեզ ներկայացնում օտար երկրներում։ Այս ընտրված պաշտոնյաները ապացուցել են, որ նրանք հաճախ այնպիսի խնդիրներ են մտցնում օրակարգ, որոնք հակասության մեջ են ամերիկյան բուն արժեքների հետ։ Այդ պատճառով մենք` ԱՄՆ հասարակությունը, պետք է դատապարտենք օտար երկրներում սեփական շահերը հետապնդելու նպատակով և հաճախ ի վնաս տվյալ երկրի բնակչության կատարվող աճպարարությունները։ Այս տեսակ քաղաքականությունը խոչընդոտում է այդ երկրների հետագա ծաղկումն ու անկախությունը` սերմանելով դառնություն և թշնամություն հասարակ ԱՄՆ քաղաքացիների նկատմամբ, ովքեր ոչ անպայմանորեն խրախուսել կամ անգամ տեղյակ են եղել այդ վնասաբեր ամերիկյան քաղաքական ծրագրերի մասին։ Այդ ամենի հետևանքում, մեզ օտար երկրներում թյուր ներկայացնելու պատճառով մեր կառավարությունը մեզ համար անհարմար և երբեմն անգամ վտանգավոր է դարձրել «Հպարտ եմ ամերիկացի լինելու համար» խոսքերն արտաբերել արտասահմանում ճանապարհորդելիս։
    Վերոնշյալ քաղաքական աճպարարության վերջին օրինակներից է 2013 թ. մարտի 2-ին դրանից 12 օր առաջ տեղի ունեցած ՀՀ նախագահի ընտրության վավերացումը`  գործող նախագահ Սերժ Սարգսյանին վերընտրման կապակցությամբ շնորհավորելով։ Ընտրության ընթացքը ապականված է եղել գործող նախագահի օգտին կատարված բազմաթիվ մանրազնին փաստագրված կեղծիքներով։ Այժմ Սարգսյանն օգտագործում է նախագահ Օբամայի շնորհավորական ուղերձը որպես ապացույց, որ ընտրությունն արդար ու ազատ էր։
    Ինչպես նշել եմ վերը, անկախ երկրում Օբամայի կողմից ընտրակեղծիքի օրինականացման դեմ իմ բողոքն էր դրդապատճառը, որ 2013 թ. մարտի 17–ին սկսեցի հացադուլս։ Նախագահ Օբամային բաց նամակ եմ գրել սույն թվականի մարտի 2–ին` պահանջելով, որ ետ վերցնի իր շնորհավորանքը. Ճանապարհորդությանս չվացուցակը դեռ պատրաստվում է։ Նվիրատուներին կտեղեկացնեմ մեր ծրագրի այս կարևոր հատվածի վերաբերյալ թարմացումների դեպքում։ Կարևորապես չվացուցակը բաց է առաջարկությունների համար։ Եթե ցանկանաք, որ ճանապարհին այցելեմ նաև ձեր քաղաքը, խնդրւոմ եմ իմաց տվեք, որ ես հնարավորության պարագայում փոփոխություններ մտցնեմ չվացուցակիս մեջ։
    Ես հավատացած եմ, որ այս արդար քայլը վերջակետ կդնի իմ հացադուլին և հուսով եմ, որ կհակի ԱՄՆ կառավարությանը հավատարիմ մնալ ժողովրդավարության հիմնական արժեքներին ոչ միայն ԱՄՆ սահմաններից ներս, այլև դուրս, իսկ ապագայում զերծ մնալ կոռումպացված վարչակարգերին օրինականացնելուց`ելնելով գեթ սեփական նեղ շահերից։

ՇԱՀԱՆ ՆԱԹԱԼԻ ԸՆՏԱՆԵԿԱՆ ՀԻՄՆԱԴՐՈՒԹՅՈՒՆ
    Շահան Նաթալի ընտանեկան հիմնադրության հիմնվել է Կալիֆորնիայում 1999 թ. օգոստոսի 11–ին որպես շահույթ չհետապնդող, հանրային շահ հետապնդող կորպորացիա (501)(c)(3), որը ձևավորվել է բարեգործական և հանրային նպատակներով։
 
ԻՄ ԱՆՑԱԾ ՃԱՆԱՊԱՐՀԸ
    Ես մարդու իրավունքի խնդիրներով և հետաքննական լրագրությամբ սկսել եմ զբաղվել 2000 թվականից.
    Իմ առաջին խոշոր նախաձեռնությունը նպատակաուղղված էր Հայաստանում որդեգրման կոռումպացված գործընթացներին վերջ տալուն (մանրամասներն՝ այստեղ): 2003 թ. ներկայանալով իբրև որդեգրող ծնող՝ կարողացել եմ բացահայտել ծաղկող ապօրինի որդեգրման բիզնեսի մի ամբողջ մեխանիզմ: Խնդիրը վերաբերում էր մասնավորապես ԱՄՆ-ում գործող ընկերությունների միջոցով հայ երեխաներին ապօրինի ճանապարհով Հայաստանից դուրս որդեգրելուն: Իմ բացահայտումների շնորհիվ ՀՀ ԱԺ-ը նոր օրենքներ ընդունեց որդեգրման գործընթացների նկատմամբ վերահսկողությունը խստացնելու նպատակով: Ինչևէ վերջերս (2011 թ.) ոլորտում կատարած մոնիթորինգի ընթացքում եկա այն եզրակացության, որ ավելի խիստ օրենքները պարզապես ավելի խրթին են դարձրել ապօրինի որդեգրման ընթացակարգը: 2011 թ. մարտին սկսեցի ամերիկյան կազմակերպությունների միջոցով հայ երեխաների միջազգային թրաֆիքինգի դեմ պայքարի նոր փուլը (մանրամասներն՝ այստեղ):
    2004 թ. սկզբներին ես ներգրավվեցի մի կարևոր և վտանգավոր առաքելության մեջ, որի նպատակն էր Արաբական Միացյալ Էմիրություններում հայ երեխաների և կանանց թրաֆիքինգի ցանցի բացահայտումը։ Առաքելությունը ֆինանսավորվում էր Շահան Նաթալի ընտանեկան հիմնադրության կողմից, ինչպես նաև Հայաստանում ԱՄՆ դեսպանատան տրամադրած փոքր դրամաշնորհով: Սեփական կյանքը վտանգելով՝ «Հետաքննող լրագրողներ» ՀԿ, «Հետք» օրաթերթի գլխավոր խմբագիր Էդիկ Բաղդասարյանին ու ինձ ի վերջո հաջողվել է ազատ արձակել թրաֆիքինգի մի քանի զոհի և կանխել հազարավոր այլոց՝ այդ նույն ուղու վրա կանգնելու հավանականությունը «Անապատի գիշերներում» գրքի և տեսաֆիլմի միջոցով, որի զանգվածային տարածմանը երկուսս էլ մեծապես նպաստեցինք: «Սեռական շահագործման նպատակով թրաֆիքինգի թեմայով հետաքննողական լրագրության կարևորագույն աշխատանքը հոդվածների «Անապատի գիշերներ» (Desert Nights) շարքն է», գրել է ԵԱՀԿ-ն իր Հայաստանի Հայաստանում մարդկանց թրաֆիքինգի մասին զեկույցում:
    Այսօր Շահան Նաթալի ընտանեկան հիմնադրությունը (եկամտահարկից հանվող) Ձեր ավանդի կարիքն ունի, որպեսզի ինձ օգնի իրականացնել իմ կարևոր առաքելությունը, այն է` պարտավորեցնել ԱՄՆ կառավարությանը բարձր պահել հիմնարար ժողովրդավարական արժեքներն ողջ աշխարհում։

Suddenly changes in your body happen and you are without access to medical resources or hygiene supplies. It becomes embarrassing to attend class without tampons. There is no private bathroom so you walk a mile away to escape the ridicules of classmates. On your way back to school, you are assaulted by a group of men and are exposed to gender and sexual violence. Your studies faulter and suddenly your family's economic strain is worsened by a mother with failing health. You decide to drop out of school altogether. This is a reality for thousands of girls in Haiti every year.</h3>
<h3>In Haiti, within the minority that is able to attend secondary school, the gender gap becomes increasingly disparate. There are on average twice as many boys who complete high school (67% versus 33% of girls). 22% of women are actively using modern birth control methods and gender-based violence is rising.</h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://25.media.tumblr.com/94cb48ae7e9d69d1a51507a237e52bbf/tumblr_mnme5suiUS1sta3oao1_500.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Project Summary: </strong>We will be conducting a health survey from July 1st-July 14th in Cite Soleil, Port Au Prince, and surrounding areas. The survey will be directed at young women and their immediate families. Three teams comprised of Haitian nurses, students from NYU and The New School, and Haitian volunteers will administer the survey. A tablet application will aid in the gathering of quantitative and qualitative data from a population with widespread illiteracy rates. </p>
<p><strong>Objective: </strong>Our primary objective is to target a time frame during which intervention is critical in the promotion of secondary education amongst at risk females in Haiti and what specific intervention in the public health spectrum is most needed. Our hope is to highlight correlations between access to feminine and sexual health care and the continuation of educational study. The information gathered during this survey will be integrated into literature for a young women’s health program covering sexual health, feminine hygiene, and gender-based violence.</p>
<h3><strong>We want to empower women to become health embassadors within their schools and communities. We want to open a diologue free of social stigmas and learn from the experiences of the strong and intelligent women of Haiti.</strong></h3>

Suddenly changes in your body happen and you are without access to medical resources or hygiene supplies. It becomes embarrassing to attend class without tampons. There is no private bathroom so you walk a mile away to escape the ridicules of classmates. On your way back to school, you are assaulted by a group of men and are exposed to gender and sexual violence. Your studies faulter and suddenly your family's economic strain is worsened by a mother with failing health. You decide to drop out of school altogether. This is a reality for thousands of girls in Haiti every year.
In Haiti, within the minority that is able to attend secondary school, the gender gap becomes increasingly disparate. There are on average twice as many boys who complete high school (67% versus 33% of girls). 22% of women are actively using modern birth control methods and gender-based violence is rising.

Project Summary: We will be conducting a health survey from July 1st-July 14th in Cite Soleil, Port Au Prince, and surrounding areas. The survey will be directed at young women and their immediate families. Three teams comprised of Haitian nurses, students from NYU and The New School, and Haitian volunteers will administer the survey. A tablet application will aid in the gathering of quantitative and qualitative data from a population with widespread illiteracy rates. 
Objective: Our primary objective is to target a time frame during which intervention is critical in the promotion of secondary education amongst at risk females in Haiti and what specific intervention in the public health spectrum is most needed. Our hope is to highlight correlations between access to feminine and sexual health care and the continuation of educational study. The information gathered during this survey will be integrated into literature for a young women’s health program covering sexual health, feminine hygiene, and gender-based violence.
We want to empower women to become health embassadors within their schools and communities. We want to open a diologue free of social stigmas and learn from the experiences of the strong and intelligent women of Haiti.

We have this endeavor partly funded by a school grant, but this campaign will allow us to put together an amazing team of nurses and volunteers and pay for transportation, living, and technology costs while we are in Haiti. 
Funds that we raise that exceed our goal of $6,000 will go towards the construction of a women's health clinic in Croix-des-Bouquets, a rural area outside of Port-au-Prince with limited access to health and counseling resources. 
Daily updates will be posted on our blog with videos, pictures, and journal entries about our work during the research trip.

<b>Real women, global vision: <br/>illuminating our historical

</h3><p></p><p>The Suppressed Histories Archives (founded 1970) is entering
a new phase. We’ve already begun the huge task of digitizing the 15,000+ slide
collection, and expanding the <a href=""www.suppressedhistories.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>. This will
make more of its visual treasures and resources accessible on the worldwide

the slide collection. Max began scanning the slide
collection six years ago, tray by slide tray. But digitization is simply
too much, too slow, and too much eye strain for one person (especially
with all the other computer work that needs to be done). There are 125 slide
trays and several thousands more slides in boxes.  </p>
<p>The process of reconfiguring the Suppressed Histories web
site has already begun, with a new landing page and site design in the works. A

All of these tasks involve labor: design, information architecture,
and content migration / formatting. It’s a huge undertaking. Some skilled labor is
being donated, but most of the organization and labeling can only be done by
Max, who has most of it in her head. She has kept the Archives going with no
external funding, an achievement made possible through long hours -- decades -- of unpaid work. Community funding will accelerate the capacity of
the Suppressed Histories Archives to pour out cultural resources (and political
history) that women need to combat the demoralizing climate of backlash. We are

Analyze the impact of the media by studying the biases in various news sources and how it impacted perception
The ImpactBy doing this, we hope to spread light on something that we believe is important to understand. How much of present day conflict is the result of misunderstanding and miscommunication?Where your funds will goThis link has a google document with a spreadsheet, which shares our funds and what money is being spent. The $4,000 graciously given to us by the Office of Undergraduate Research covers our flights and some of our lodging-- you can make this amazing project a reality by helping us cover the last few expenses. While we can stay within the $4,000 budget by shortening our stay in Ireland, it would also prevent us from cultural immersion and limit our ability to collect data and interview residents, and therefore our project would not reach its full potential. We appreciate every dollar towards our research!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>GETheatre is a New York based theatre company that was started
in 2006 by two PhD students from New York University and these students (now

has traveled back to East Africa and held workshops to improve English language
literacy, foster critical thinking skills, explore creative self-expression,
and develop a sense of world citizenship in young people from Tanzania. And,
GETheatre has continued to grow by creating workshops in India for young people
as well. They are doing really amazing work that I believe in.</p>
<p>GET has achieved so much in just a few years and I am so
grateful that I will be joining them (hopefully!) on the next leg of their
journey as they work to empower students in Africa. But, I am going to need
your help to do it. I hope you will consider supporting my work with a donation
to GET on my behalf, to make this opportunity and dream a reality. With the
support of my family and friends, I will be able to educate and create with
students who are living in desperate situations. It is my life’s work to use
theatre as a tool for dialogue and growth in vulnerable communities, showing
them that their voice matters, their stories need to be heard, and they can
change their world. This opportunity with GET is a chance to do just that.</p>
<p>Thank you so very much for supporting me as I work to make a
difference in communities all around the world. I would never be able to do the
work that I do without the support of the people I love. Please let me
