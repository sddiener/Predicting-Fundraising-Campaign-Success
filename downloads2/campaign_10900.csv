With its colorful and bright planet ring, the device syncs your playlist with its lights keeping you ablaze. Designed as sophisticated and lightweight, Music Planet guarantees its users a deep bass sound and sharp treble that is just perfect for your entertainment.  The splendor of the universe is breath-taking and always fascinates us. The twinkling light from the stars makes us want to have a feel of the outer world. It’s the place where human curiosity and the spirit of adventure gather. Saturn is one of the most beautiful planets in our solar system, surrounded by a beautiful and bright planet ring. The exceptional ring is composed of millions of disordered suspended particles under the influence of gravity. The mystical suspension of particles on the rings and the different luminous rings makes Saturn a sight to behold. This distinctively beautiful planet is the inspiration of our beloved Music Planet. Music Planet displays the beauty of Saturn by lighting up the planet’s translucent ring plate with programmed LED. With unlimited combination of colors sparkled by a fixed eight color cyclic gradient, it re-creates the multi-layered ring around Saturn.  The translucent texture structure is applied on the planet ring to perfectly depict the floating ring. With the colorful light, we can see the ring hovering over the planet’s sparkling surface.  Music Planet is your perfect music companion to create the most preferable atmosphere for you. It has two lighting modes – breath and party; designed to match your mood at different occasions and functions.  In breath mode, the lighting ring flashs slowly in a fixed color or an eight-color loop. The lighting changes perfectly match with soft music. It helps to create a romantic atmosphere for you and your lover, and to sleep easily by capturing your attention and making you at ease.  In party mode, the lighting ring flashs quickly in a fixed color or an eight-color loop. Its shinning lighting is perfect for pop, hip-hop, RnB music. It revitalizes the mood around to be ecstatic and dynamic, to offer a happy and passionate moment to you and your friends. Vincent van Gogh’s “The Starry Night” is a great art work showing the changes and fluidity of the starry sky. In 2016, famous Turkey artist Garip AY reproduced this masterpiece using the “Ebru” art painting. This method made“The Starry Night” stand out distinctly. EBRU, the art of ""Painting on Water""“Ebru”, aka “The Turkish art of Marbling”, is the painting art by sprinkling and brushing pigments on the oily water, and then transforming this pattern to paper. In the 14th century, Ebru art was introduced to Anatolia from Iran via the Silk Road and flourished in the Ottoman Empire.Ebru painting is a free art creation following the natural flow of water. However, it’s actually a great challenge for a painter to control the flow of water and pigment. The result of this process is unique and it’s never possible to achieve the same design.  Unique Fluid Art, Unique Planet  The design of Music Planet was fueled by curiosity and imagination about the planet. From the photos taken by NASA, each of the planets has its distinct landscape, which is similar with Ebru art. It leds us to carry out simulations on how our device’s design could bear the uniqueness of the Ebru fluid art. As you rightly guessed, it was successful.   Music Planet has a Dual neodymium motor that creates symmetrical magnetic field in control of full range applications with a dedicated design. Having a tr-band equalization, it is suitable for all genres of music.  A Custom-Made Interior DesignIn order to minimize unwanted interference, our designers researched on creating a “nuclear reactor” interior structure. We thickened the speaker’s cover, added multiple impression to the interior wall, tune chips and circuit board. This interior design perfectly improved the experience of space and sound quality.  Adjustable Speaker, Directional SoundMost of audio speakers are placed and directed forward.

 Proceeds from this campaign will be used to fund the initial hardware investment needed to mass produce the audio technology behind Rockit Logs.Upon fulfillment to our backers, going forward, Rockit Logs will donate profits to the Rise & Shine Foundation which was founded during the first crowdfunding campaign that brought the documentary film to life at the request of fans everywhere. Rise & Shine Foundation Mission Statement: To empower young athletes by helping them identify their strengths and providing them with the tools they'll need to Rise & Shine through whatever their passions may be.Inspired by the award winning documentary film 'Rise & Shine: The Jay DeMerit Story,' the Rise & Shine Foundation will promote the key messages of the film such as hard work, perseverance, self-belief, and a DREAM BIG mentality.Funds managed by the Rise & Shine Foundation will eliminate financial and logistical roadblocks faced by many and enable the Rise & Shine Retreat to open its doors to more participants, inviting them to join in on the wide variety of skill-building activities in addition to sports camps, in an all-encompassing mountain retreat.The 3 Goals of the Rise & Shine FoundationGoal 1: Facilitate Rising & Shining: Every kid should have dreams and aspirations, whether they are sport-focused or related to their passion for arts, music, or food! As former professional athletes, Rise & Shine Retreat founders Ashleigh and Jay DeMerit recognize the valuable life lessons and sense of empowerment that can come from sports and recreation. Most importantly, the contribution these activities make to overall emotional, mental, and physical health allows participants to be productive, happy members of society.  Goal 2: Be Inclusive: We want to make sure that every kid has the opportunity to take part in our program, so we have created the Rise & Shine Foundation -- our charitable element to enable those who would not have access to the funds required to join in, with the help of our favorite supporters and various fundraising initiatives.Goal 3: Get the Community Involved: Part of the Rise & Shine project is focused on creating a strong sense of community. Jay grew up in the tight knit community of Green Bay, WI and Ashleigh was raised on the spirited family values within the ski town, Whistler, BC.   It is important to them to help enrich their communities, and the two of them look forward to doing that in Pemberton for the entire surrounding area. Whether it is using the food from the farms produced next door, running free clinics in sport for the local kids, or promoting local businesses, community is key.",43.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The Sound BlasterX H5 Valencia CF Edition comes with the
BlasterX Acoustic Engine software for Windows. It features a unique customized
profile only available for this headset that is specially tuned for FIFA 16

<p>The Acoustic Engine software comes with four other pre-set

that they are playing. For instance, ‘First-Person Shooter’ increases spatial
reality and perception with virtual surround, ‘Action &amp; Adventure’ enhances
realism for a cinematic experience, ‘Real Time Strategy’ boosts clarity and
reduces distractions so that gamers stay focused when pitched against time, and
‘Driving’ magnifies details such as tire noises as the car races along–enabling
gamers to hear subtle differences while racing.<a href=""http://blasterx.com/software/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>

<h3>Mejora tu audio con el software BlasterX Acoustic Engine Lite </h3>
<p>Los auriculares también traen disponible un perfil específico para los jugadores de EA SPORTS™ FIFA 16 con el que podrán disfrutar de todo el sonido ambiente. Este nuevo perfil de audio “Stadium” se creó mediante un proceso en el que se colocaron micrófonos en puntos estratégicos del estadio de Mestalla, el campo del Valencia CF. La información que se generó fue usada para definir el perfil de audio que permitirá a los usuarios disfrutar al máximo del sonido ambiente mientras juegan a FIFA 16 en el estadio de su equipo.</p>
<p>El software Acoustic Engine viene con cuatro perfiles predefinidos que permiten a los jugadores personalizar el audio en función del género al que jueguen. Por ejemplo, en los juegos de disparos en primera persona, ‘First-Person Shooter’, se incrementa la percepción del entorno que nos envuelve, en los juegos de acción y aventuras, ‘Action &amp; Adventure’ se mejora el realismo para obtener una experiencia cinematográfica, en el modo de estrategia en tiempo real, ‘Real Time Strategy’, se potencia la claridad y se reducen las distracciones para que los jugadores estén concentrados en todo momento, y en los juegos de conducción, ‘Driving’, se magnifican los detalles como los sonidos de las ruedas mientras el coche compite, permitiendo a los jugadores notar el agarre en las carreras. </p>

all shapes and sizes—for a comfortable fit without compromising stability and
sturdiness.



Tilt Driver Design

The Sound BlasterX H5 Valencia CF Edition is designed with a tilt driver
implementation that creates a mini acoustic chamber to minimize resonance
within the earcups. The result is that you experience extra clarity across the
frequencies and better sound separation where every detail crisp and clear.



Hear Only Your Voice
The detachable noise-reduction microphone filters ambient sounds so you can
be heard clearly, even in a noisy environment.


When you're not
gaming, detach your microphone from the headset and you'll get a pair of
compact headphones that's ready for great music on the go.





One-touch Convenience

With the inline remote, you're in control of your music, volume and
voice calls - easy and convenient!


  
Braided Cables for Lasting Durability
The Sound BlasterX H5 Valencia CF Edition comes with a detachable cable that fits snugly and is well protected from accidental tugs and pulls. It reduces tangling, fraying and ensures long-lasting durability for rigorous gameplay.






Seamless Connectivity
The Sound BlasterX H5 Valencia CF Edition offers a wide range of
connectivity options for a holistic gaming experience. The 3.5mm 4-pole jack
cable can be used with any smart device such as your iPhone and iPad, as well
as today's gaming consoles such as PlayStation®4 and XBOX® One.
There's an included 1.2m Y-splitter cable (that fits the older 3-pole
plug-in implementation) where one jack is used for microphone input, and the
other for audio output.




Where Style Meets Function



This exquisite crystalline capsule package is a head-turner where design is concerned. Use this as a carry case to protect your entertainment headset from bumps and knocks. The best of both worlds!

Comienza la colaboración

Los fans del Valencia CF de todo el mundo están a punto de disfrutar de otra forma el sonido muy pronto.
El Valencia CF, uno de los equipos más grandes de la liga de fútbol española, se ha asociado con Creative para crear los auriculares Sound BlasterX H5 Valencia CF Edition. La edición especial de estos auriculares está personalizada en exclusiva para los fans del Valencia CF, que podrán llevar con orgullo el escudo del Valencia impreso a láser en sus auriculares. 


Los auriculares están basados en la serie Creative Sound BlasterX pro-gaming y vienen con un audio profesional listos para dar la mejor calidad en música, películas y juegos, así como su propio software para personalizar los diferentes perfiles de audio. 



Para obtener a un perfil de audio único, solo disponible para estos auriculares y diseñado especialmente para EA SPORTS™ FIFA 16, se ha capturado el sonido ambiente de Mestalla y permitirá a los usuarios sentirse como si estuvieran sentados dentro del estadio viendo un partido del Valencia. 

¿Por qué Indiegogo?
Estamos encantados de poder ofrecer al Valencia CF y a sus seguidores nuestra experiencia en tecnología y audio en este proyecto. Este proyecto de Indiegogo representa una oportunidad única para los fans que quieran formar parte del desarrollo de este producto. De alguna manera es un proyecto para los fans creado gracias a los fans. 
Ahora con los auriculares Sound BlasterX H5 Valencia CF Edition, los seguidores pueden tener la oportunidad de llevar el escudo de su equipo con orgullo mientras escuchan música, ven películas o juegan. Y gracias a que este proyecto está en Indiegogo, los fans pueden esperar suculentos descuentos.

El logo del Valencia CF está serigrafiado en metal con láser en los laterales de auriculares Sound BlasterX H5 Valencia CF Edition. Forma parte del legado valencianista con los Sound BlasterX H5 Valencia CF Edition. 



Mejora tu audio con el software BlasterX Acoustic Engine Lite 
Los auriculares también traen disponible un perfil específico para los jugadores de EA SPORTS™ FIFA 16 con el que podrán disfrutar de todo el sonido ambiente. Este nuevo perfil de audio “Stadium” se creó mediante un proceso en el que se colocaron micrófonos en puntos estratégicos del estadio de Mestalla, el campo del Valencia CF. La información que se generó fue usada para definir el perfil de audio que permitirá a los usuarios disfrutar al máximo del sonido ambiente mientras juegan a FIFA 16 en el estadio de su equipo.
El software Acoustic Engine viene con cuatro perfiles predefinidos que permiten a los jugadores personalizar el audio en función del género al que jueguen. Por ejemplo, en los juegos de disparos en primera persona, ‘First-Person Shooter’, se incrementa la percepción del entorno que nos envuelve, en los juegos de acción y aventuras, ‘Action & Adventure’ se mejora el realismo para obtener una experiencia cinematográfica, en el modo de estrategia en tiempo real, ‘Real Time Strategy’, se potencia la claridad y se reducen las distracciones para que los jugadores estén concentrados en todo momento, y en los juegos de conducción, ‘Driving’, se magnifican los detalles como los sonidos de las ruedas mientras el coche compite, permitiendo a los jugadores notar el agarre en las carreras.

Who we are
We're two guys and a gal who love and are obsessed with innovative products and beautiful design. We started DnJ Design after 20 years of actual experience in the wireless industry. Over the years we've seen and interacted with thousands of wireless products. Sometimes they inspired us and other times they disappointed, but through it all we learned the trade and figured out what people love and want.  The Shot is DnJ's first product and we're super excited to share it with you. It's truly something that we always envisioned for ourselves and it's finally here. The Shot is a tiny and very chic Bluetooth speaker with amazing sound quality. We're extremely proud of The Shot and can't wait for you to try it. When you purchase our product and give us your seal of approval, you'll enable us to finalize production and packaging of The Shot.


What We Need
We only need $2,500 for final packaging for retail distribution.

The Shot is fully developed, tested and ready to go! All we need is packaging.
Here is a sample of the retail packaging that we designed:

always been feeling a desire to customize your earphones, so they reflect your
personal style? Are the black or white earphones not matching your current
outfit or did you always wanted to have something different than everyone else?
There are several manufacturers who customize your earphones according to your
current needs. But what if your style changes over time, would you make another
customized purchase, or would you simply stick with your current ones? </p>
<p>Style is
not the only thing that changes over time, technology is another critical
aspect. Have you also been annoyed that manufacturers update their headphones and
you have to buy an entire new set? Wouldn`t it be easier to just replace the
updated parts? And what if some parts have manufacturing issues and break after
a certain time period? Now imagine you would have the possibility to simply
replace the updated or broken part for a fraction of the entire price? </p>
<p>The InTec
In-Ear Headphones addresses all of those limitations and enables you to
customize the way you listen to your music and therefore revolutionizes the
entire headphone market. </p>

<p><u><i><b>The System</b></i></u></p>
<p>MusicFreedom connects the phone,
left-hand-sided and right-hand-sided earbud using Bluetooth.  High fidelity codec-aptX® is used to transfer
Digital audio data, where the digital data is encoded with CD quality. Either
one of the unit can act as a receiver as well as a relay for passing data to
the second unit. Also three control profiles will be used, AVRCP will use to
send link control data; whereas the advance EQ and voice notification data  will send by SPP (for Android) or Bluetooth Low Energy Profile (BLE 4.0 for iPhone).</p>
<p>There also has a voice menu,
in which MusicFreedom will tell you the current status of the device; such as
current connection state, battery level and etc.</p>
<p>The man-machine-interface has only
one single button and two LEDs on each side. The multiple functions button is easy
to use but powerful, you can control everything 
at your finger tip.</p>

both moving-coil + balanced-armature drivers. This combination can deliver a
relatively flat and wide frequency response.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/708217/files/20140710103814-drivers.jpg?1405013894"" src="""" style=""width: 65px; height: 117px;""/></b></p><h4><b><b>Moving-coil</b></b></h4><b></b><p></p>
<p>“The moving coil driver, more
commonly referred to as a ""dynamic"" driver, is the most common type
used in headphones. The operating principle consists of a stationary magnetic
element affixed to the frame of the headphone which sets up a static magnetic
field...The alternating magnetic field produced by the current through the coil
reacts against the static magnetic field in turn, causing the coil and attached
diaphragm to move the air, thus producing sound...""(from wikipedia.org)</p><p><b></b></p><p></p>
<p>Pros<b></b></p><ul>
<li><p>Sound signature is more coherent</p></li>
<li><p>Better bass response</p></li>
<li><p>More durable and cheaper</p></li>
</ul><p>Cons</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li><p>Not as detailed as balanced armature drivers</p></li>
<li><p>Larger</p></li>
<li><p>Slower response</p></li>
<p></p>
</ul><p><b>Balanced armature</b></p>
<p>“A balanced armature is a sound transducer design
primarily intended to increase the electrical efficiency of the element by
eliminating the stress on the diaphragm characteristic of many other magnetic
transducer systems…when there is electric current through the coil, it
magnetizes the armature one way or the other, causing it to rotate slightly one
way or the other about the pivot thus moving the diaphragm to make sound…</p>
<p>The design is not mechanically stable; a slight imbalance
makes the armature stick to one pole of the magnet. A fairly stiff restoring
force is required to hold the armature in the 'balance' position. Although this
reduces its efficiency, this design can still produce more sound from less
power than any other…” (</p><p style=""display: inline !important;"">from wikipedia.org).</p><p></p>
<p>Pros</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<b></b><b></b><p>Drivers can be tuned for specific frequency ranges</p>
</li>
<li><p>Smaller in size</p></li>
<li><p>Better treble performance</p></li>
<li><p>Faster response and more detailed sound</p></li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>Cons</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<b></b><b></b><p>Bass response is not good<br/></p>
</li>
<li><p>Narrow frequency range</p></li>
<li><p>More expensive</p></li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>There is no doubt that both technologies
have their pros and cons. It is hard to say which one is better
because they both excel in different situations. In summary, balanced armature
drivers typically offer a more detailed sound. Dynamic drivers offer a more
coherent and powerful sound, and are often described as warm-sounding.</p>
<p><u><b><i>The Maths</i></b></u></p>
<p>The main processor in MusicFreedom is

has a dual-core architecture with embedded DSP + MCU core. </p>
<p> The balance armature driver provide treble frequency response of 200-200kHz and the moving coil

<p>Mechanically, MusicFreedom uses solid
plastic housing and it is designed with two acoustic chambers.
At the front of the drivers, there is a hemi-mixing chamber, its hemisphere-like-design reflects sound wave to a single point and results in a solid and better defined
sound location. The opening at that chamber has a trumpet design, this
will reduce any interference waves propagate to your ear. The positioning for
two difference type of drivers are carefully designed so as to enhance the bass
response.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/708243/files/20140710104903-section_right.jpg?1405014543"" src="""" style=""width: 333.7191780821918px; height: 298px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/708244/files/20140710104916-trumpet.jpg?1405014556"" src="""" style=""width: 233.5890410958904px; height: 294px;""/></p><br/><p>

even during exercise. There is three silicon rings + four ear tips which
securely fits in your ear and providing grip. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/708257/files/20140710105249-earbud.jpg?1405014769"" src="""" style=""width: 319.5px; height: 71px;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/708258/files/20140710105308-fittings.jpg?1405014788"" src="""" style=""width: 277.27710843373495px; height: 74px;""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><u><i><b>The Design</b></i></u></p>
<p><u></u></p>
<p>For  hardware, the PCB is designed
with 4 layers in which there has a full ground plane. The component placements are
carefully designed and fully separated between the analog audio, RF and digital parts to avoid
interference. Also traces between the DACs and the drivers are kept as short as
possible. High precision solid-state capacitors and high quality inductors are
used. All the above results in an electronically clean and noise proof environment.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/708260/files/20140710105442-pcb.jpg?1405014882"" src="""" style=""width: 158.76288659793812px; height: 77px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/708262/files/20140710105459-PCBA.jpg?1405014899"" src="""" style=""width: 102.90322580645162px; height: 145px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/708263/files/20140710105506-back_PCBA.jpg?1405014906"" src="""" style=""width: 83.91489361702128px; height: 136px;""/></p><br/><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As this is a dual drivers system, each
driver is responsible for different frequency range, therefore filters are
needed. Unlike other systems, we are the first dual drivers
system making use of DSP with digital filters instead of using analog
passive filters. The problem of analog passive filters is their cut off
frequency is not sharp and not accurate. Another problem is that hardware components need to
be placed at the audio path of the circuit, any component, even a single wire,
at the audio path will definitely affect the acoustic performance. Therefore we use digital filters so
that we can accurately control the frequency delivered to each driver and
also provide a direct, non-interrupted audio pathway in the circuitry. Also
there have two separated DACs in each unit, and each driver powered by its own DAC . This maintains the impedance of different type of driver. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/708269/files/20140710105643-schematic.jpg?1405015003"" src="""" style=""width: 367.7327586206897px; height: 241px;""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>
</p><p><u><i><b>The Apps</b></i></u></p>
<p>With the MusicFreedom apps, user can
directly control the device through a user-friendly GUI.</p>
<p>User can setup different voice
notifications by using the text-to-speech engine. Also with the sensors at
your phone, you can have notifications such as speed, distance, navigation,
rotation, g-force, time, date, altitude and much more.</p>
<p>Also, advance user can fine tune the
EQ for their own music favorite. </p><p>We will provide an API for developer who may want to create their own
apps sending voice or control the device.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/708271/files/20140710105711-apps.jpg?1405015031"" src="""" style=""width: 294.0292275574113px; height: 503px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/708272/files/20140710105716-apps1.jpg?1405015036"" src="""" style=""width: 294.0142566191446px; height: 503px;""/></p><br/><p></p>

</p><p><u><i><b>The Results</b></i></u></p>
<p>As for any high quality audio
system, the ultimate goal is to 100% reproduce what is recorded in the media.
Although “acoustic performance” is a subjective statement but we can still quantify a system by using
mathematical model. Here, the MusicFreedom is benchmarked
with a famous wired triple balanced armatures earphone. And the result is as followed.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/708279/files/20140710105901-frequencyResponse.jpg?1405015141"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>The design started in 2013 summer. As
a music lover, I own several high end multi balanced armatures earphones. One day when I was listening to music while running, I found that
there have serious noise problem when wind passing through the wires of my
earphone. Also mechanical noises from the wires disturbed my music whenever I moved my
head. Therefore I started this project, and it has only one goal: to create
an in-ear headphone that provides the best sound quality. Therefore we removed any wire, added two different types of driver and carefully engineered in both electronically and mechanically.</span></p>
<p>Throughout the last few months,
intensive design works have been done. With the help of CAD, our engineers
simulated more than three versions of PCB and enclosure. These simulations
include PCB level EM wave interference, placement of the drivers, frequency
response, resonance frequency, sound wave propagation, ergonomics study... and
finally we came up with the current design. You must have to try it on, it
re-defines the perfection of acoustic performance.</p>
<p><u><i><b>The Team</b></i></u></p><p>Our team consists of professionals from Bluetooth industry, and also a team of creative problem solvers. Our experts have been working in the Bluetooth industry for a decade. Now we are trying to solve a missing piece in the current market; and that is a no wire in-earphone with high end audio performance. The target is to replace the existing wired high-end earphone.</p><p><u><i><b>The Schedule </b></i></u></p>
<p>The current status of the project is at the engineering sample stage. Firmware is ready, and interoperability tested
with popular phones in the market. Hardware, production software, test jig,
Bluetooth tester, spectrum analyzer and audio analyzer are all prepared. The
Bluetooth qualification pre-tests are passed. The apps is under development and
will be ready after the first mass production run.</p>
<p>The next phase for this project will
be production, we plan to have the alpha pre-production run in October and first production
run in December.</p>
<p>If this project success, we will continuous to develop a

Wireless Musical Device to Meet Your Audio SatisfactionMusicFreedom is a stereo wireless
in-ear headphone provided the best audio quality for users, it is the next
generation of high-end earphone. This unique device is a dual drivers system
consisting of balanced armature driver for high fidelity middle and upper end
frequencies; and also composing a moving coil driver for bass.
One of our uniqueness is the first
dual drivers system of which uses DSP with digital filters to deliver sound to
the different drivers instead of using analog passive filters; and therefore it
can ensure the best acoustic performance.
MusicFreedom is compact in size (only
weight 6g) but it is specially designed with two acoustic chambers, one hemi-mixing
chamber for mixing the sound wave from drivers; whilst the second chamber is
placed behind the drivers as air buffer. Mechanically the drivers are mounted
on a solid piece of plastic device which provides air tight between chambers.
Also MusicFreedom is ergonomically designed to fit in your ear comfortably which you can use it for whole day long.
There will also have a free apps
for user to control and fine tune the MusicFreedom; and it will support both
android and ios device. The MusicFreedom’s apps can be used to setup voice
notification too, for example you can set speed, distance, navigation while you
are riding bicycle. In case, if you want to write your own apps, there will
also be a set of API provided to meet your requirement.



The Features   Balanced armature + moving coil dual drivers configuration
  Engineered for the
  best audio performance
 No
  cables
 Easy to use, multi-functions single
  button design
  Ergonomically design
  for comfortable wear
  Smartphone apps to configure your MusicFreedom,setup notifications and API for developer
The System
MusicFreedom connects the phone,
left-hand-sided and right-hand-sided earbud using Bluetooth.  High fidelity codec-aptX® is used to transfer
Digital audio data, where the digital data is encoded with CD quality. Either
one of the unit can act as a receiver as well as a relay for passing data to
the second unit. Also three control profiles will be used, AVRCP will use to
send link control data; whereas the advance EQ and voice notification data  will send by SPP (for Android) or Bluetooth Low Energy Profile (BLE 4.0 for iPhone).
There also has a voice menu,
in which MusicFreedom will tell you the current status of the device; such as
current connection state, battery level and etc.
The man-machine-interface has only
one single button and two LEDs on each side. The multiple functions button is easy
to use but powerful, you can control everything 
at your finger tip.

The Hardware



The heart of MusicFreedom consists of
both moving-coil + balanced-armature drivers. This combination can deliver a
relatively flat and wide frequency response.

Moving-coil
“The moving coil driver, more
commonly referred to as a ""dynamic"" driver, is the most common type
used in headphones. The operating principle consists of a stationary magnetic
element affixed to the frame of the headphone which sets up a static magnetic
field...The alternating magnetic field produced by the current through the coil
reacts against the static magnetic field in turn, causing the coil and attached
diaphragm to move the air, thus producing sound...""(from wikipedia.org)
Pros
Sound signature is more coherent
Better bass response
More durable and cheaper
Cons

Not as detailed as balanced armature drivers
Larger
Slower response

Balanced armature
“A balanced armature is a sound transducer design
primarily intended to increase the electrical efficiency of the element by
eliminating the stress on the diaphragm characteristic of many other magnetic
transducer systems…when there is electric current through the coil, it
magnetizes the armature one way or the other, causing it to rotate slightly one
way or the other about the pivot thus moving the diaphragm to make sound…
The design is not mechanically stable; a slight imbalance
makes the armature stick to one pole of the magnet. A fairly stiff restoring
force is required to hold the armature in the 'balance' position. Although this
reduces its efficiency, this design can still produce more sound from less
power than any other…” (from wikipedia.org).
Pros


Drivers can be tuned for specific frequency ranges

Smaller in size
Better treble performance
Faster response and more detailed sound

Cons


Bass response is not good

Narrow frequency range
More expensive

There is no doubt that both technologies
have their pros and cons. It is hard to say which one is better
because they both excel in different situations. In summary, balanced armature
drivers typically offer a more detailed sound. Dynamic drivers offer a more
coherent and powerful sound, and are often described as warm-sounding.
The Maths
The main processor in MusicFreedom is
by CSR, which it has high resolution DAC. The SNR of the DAC is 98Db. The processor
has a dual-core architecture with embedded DSP + MCU core. 
 The balance armature driver provide treble frequency response of 200-200kHz and the moving coil
driver is responsible for the lower frequency of 5-20kHz.

The package includes: left and right MusicFreedom, carrying case, charging dual micro-USB cable, user manual, 3 fitting silicon rings and 4 different size ear tips.
 



The Physics
Mechanically, MusicFreedom uses solid
plastic housing and it is designed with two acoustic chambers.
At the front of the drivers, there is a hemi-mixing chamber, its hemisphere-like-design reflects sound wave to a single point and results in a solid and better defined
sound location. The opening at that chamber has a trumpet design, this
will reduce any interference waves propagate to your ear. The positioning for
two difference type of drivers are carefully designed so as to enhance the bass
response.

MusicFreedom is ergonomically designed
to fit in your ear comfortably, and this allows you to use it whole day long or
even during exercise. There is three silicon rings + four ear tips which
securely fits in your ear and providing grip. 


The Design

For  hardware, the PCB is designed
with 4 layers in which there has a full ground plane. The component placements are
carefully designed and fully separated between the analog audio, RF and digital parts to avoid
interference. Also traces between the DACs and the drivers are kept as short as
possible. High precision solid-state capacitors and high quality inductors are
used. All the above results in an electronically clean and noise proof environment.


As this is a dual drivers system, each
driver is responsible for different frequency range, therefore filters are
needed. Unlike other systems, we are the first dual drivers
system making use of DSP with digital filters instead of using analog
passive filters. The problem of analog passive filters is their cut off
frequency is not sharp and not accurate. Another problem is that hardware components need to
be placed at the audio path of the circuit, any component, even a single wire,
at the audio path will definitely affect the acoustic performance. Therefore we use digital filters so
that we can accurately control the frequency delivered to each driver and
also provide a direct, non-interrupted audio pathway in the circuitry. Also
there have two separated DACs in each unit, and each driver powered by its own DAC . This maintains the impedance of different type of driver. 

The Apps
With the MusicFreedom apps, user can
directly control the device through a user-friendly GUI.
User can setup different voice
notifications by using the text-to-speech engine. Also with the sensors at
your phone, you can have notifications such as speed, distance, navigation,
rotation, g-force, time, date, altitude and much more.
Also, advance user can fine tune the
EQ for their own music favorite. We will provide an API for developer who may want to create their own
apps sending voice or control the device.


The Results
As for any high quality audio
system, the ultimate goal is to 100% reproduce what is recorded in the media.
Although “acoustic performance” is a subjective statement but we can still quantify a system by using
mathematical model. Here, the MusicFreedom is benchmarked
with a famous wired triple balanced armatures earphone. And the result is as followed.

As shown, MusicFreedom (in
purple color) has a relatively flat and wider frequency range. (Please note that due
to imperfect of our testing equipment, the above testing is for reference only)
The Project


The design started in 2013 summer. As
a music lover, I own several high end multi balanced armatures earphones. One day when I was listening to music while running, I found that
there have serious noise problem when wind passing through the wires of my
earphone. Also mechanical noises from the wires disturbed my music whenever I moved my
head. Therefore I started this project, and it has only one goal: to create
an in-ear headphone that provides the best sound quality. Therefore we removed any wire, added two different types of driver and carefully engineered in both electronically and mechanically.
Throughout the last few months,
intensive design works have been done. With the help of CAD, our engineers
simulated more than three versions of PCB and enclosure. These simulations
include PCB level EM wave interference, placement of the drivers, frequency
response, resonance frequency, sound wave propagation, ergonomics study... and
finally we came up with the current design. You must have to try it on, it
re-defines the perfection of acoustic performance.
The TeamOur team consists of professionals from Bluetooth industry, and also a team of creative problem solvers. Our experts have been working in the Bluetooth industry for a decade. Now we are trying to solve a missing piece in the current market; and that is a no wire in-earphone with high end audio performance. The target is to replace the existing wired high-end earphone.The Schedule 
The current status of the project is at the engineering sample stage. Firmware is ready, and interoperability tested
with popular phones in the market. Hardware, production software, test jig,
Bluetooth tester, spectrum analyzer and audio analyzer are all prepared. The
Bluetooth qualification pre-tests are passed. The apps is under development and
will be ready after the first mass production run.
The next phase for this project will
be production, we plan to have the alpha pre-production run in October and first production
run in December.
If this project success, we will continuous to develop a
series of high-end wearable audio products.The Timeline

Learning coding and musical composition couldn't be easier. It’s super intuitive. Kids experiment with Musicon and quickly understand how it works. What they create is what they hear! 

 


 
 
 

 

 
 
 
 


You are in charge. Choose a tempo from slow lullabies to 144 beats per minute.
 
 


The rotating barrel has 720 buttons – which gives you endless possibilities. This very simple system was designed to be accessible for children ages 3 and up.
 
 


Watch, enjoy and learn! The learning process is very effective because of the simple mechanics and interactive nature of Musicon.

 Wood was the obvious choice as the primary material for Musicon (more than 90%), because of its warmth, soft touch and eco-friendly properties. Wood also has a long tradition as a material for toys and musical instruments and our finely crafted wood is used, both natural and stained white. The buttons are shaped from, easy to clean, environmentally friendly plastic.  Two independent clutch systems (mechanical and electronic) constantly ensure safety. Inside of a Musicon there are controllers, a step motor and an optical sensor which ensure safety and the consistency of any composition.  Sound accuracy, harmony, and tempo result from the highly precise tools used to build Musicon. It is a fusion of traditional materials and the latest production technology.  The overall size, soft edges, and light pressure necessary to push the buttons have been carefully designed with a child’s ergonomics in mind.   How it works?

With Musicon you receive scripted lessons and expert knowledge which were created as a result of collaborations with experts. 
Control of errors – children can try variations and immediately self-correct without adult intervention.
Child-centered – kids just need to learn that buttons up = sounds. After this initial discovery the composing and fun start!
It's non-prescriptive – children have freedom to express their creativity.
It's inviting – the wood and bright colors instinctively invite the child to play with it and learn from it.
   These are just some of the places we know that Musicon fits perfectly.  We have tested Musicon with children on the autism spectrum and children with various physical, social and cognitive disabilities. After many test workshops we are confident that Musicon has great potential as a therapeutic learning tool. All the experts we’ve met, found Musicon to be a high quality, professional device which would support the therapeutic process and make the positive changes easier and fun.   “The Musicons” is a band that accompanies Musicon.They were created as another way of interacting with children. Children are fascinated by puppets and will interact with them very easily.The puppets help in the following ways:
overcoming shyness,
greater use of speech,
encouragement of focus and interplay,
encouragement of using the child’s imagination.
“The Musicons” can help children and adults enter the creative world of music and will assist  them through the processes of learning about music, coding and math.

More videos with The Musicons: www.musiconclub.com/theband
Each member of the band is also an avatar of kids' personalities:

Charlie, the Saxophone – the leader of the Musicons, who is very emotional and sensitive.

Ringo, the Drum – who is very energetic, fast and active.

Jaco, the Doublebass – who is very smart and intelligent and loves to count.
""The Musicons"" were designed by our favorite creature designer Luiza Kwiatkowska :) Check how Luiza brought The Musicons to life: Behance    Musicon as a professional instrument :)   Kamil Laszuk developed Musicon as a graduation thesis in 2011 at the Academy of Art and Design, Wrocław, Poland. It’s development was based on research into the impact that music has on children‘s psychophysical development.  While Kamil was visiting a kindergarten with his double bass he met a 2 1/2 year old deaf girl. To listen to his music Jagoda came closer and hugged the instrument. She was listening to the music with her whole body!This was a huge inspiration for Kamil’s future design work on Musicon.  Want to know more about Kamil's design? Visit: www.kamillaszuk.pl Musicon has family musical roots – Ida, Kamil & Filip are siblings. All of them are musicians but they work in various fields, using the skills that music has taught them.They have been always a great team. And they became avatars of ""The Musicons"" band. Kamil’s parents sold their home to make possible creating Musicon.  The bonds and support in the Laszuk family have always been very strong. When Kamil’s design was recognized all over the world his parents decided to help make his design come true. They sold the home and became the very first investors.  It was a long journey from the idea to the real product:  Kamil has gathered the best specialists in their fields and this team worked intensively on a prototyp. Finally, in 2016, after 18 months a fully functional prototype was created and finished.   Why crowdfunding?We already have great support from our family, friends and partners but there is still a huge part missing – YOU! Your pledges to Kickstarter will allow us to begin production.We could not think of anywhere better to bring Musicon to life. Kickstarter gives us an incredible opportunity to meet people who want to help make the world more beautiful, creative and sustainable. This platform is a confirmation that when you create something you love, everything is possible.We can create a revolution in musical education, together.  Many thanks to our family and friends for helping us make Musicon real!

<h2>***IMPORTANT FUNDING GOAL INFORMATION***</h2>
<h3>When we reach our goal of $25,000 but less than $40,000; you will only be able to order/get the <strong>ELEV8TE Series</strong> (Running Hat and Running Visor).</h3>
<h3>When we surpass $40,000, than we will unlock the Flex Fit and Trucker hat and you will be able order/get any of the four styles.</h3>
<h3>Remember, if we don't reach our goal then NO credit cards will be charged.</h3>
<h3>You are able to contribute more when you choose a perk. For example, if you choose perk #2 for $40 and you want to contribute more you can change the amount.</h3>

<p>Everyone loves to be out and about; hiking, biking, gardening or just chillin’ on the beach… and many people listen to music during these activities because it provides motivation, entertainment and energy. Earbuds and headphones are obtrusive and annoying when you’re playing hard. Our hats and visors sit comfortably away from your ears, they won’t fall out like earbuds, or annoy you with bouncing around your face. The ELEV8TE and DV8 caps are <strong>safer than traditional headphones and earbuds because nothing is covering your ears</strong> <strong>allowing you to hear your surroundings</strong>. It’s not just more comfortable it’s safer for your ears – Studies now link hearing loss to headphones and earbud use. With our caps you will be able to hear traffic, animals, car horns, sirens, other people… and be much safer.</p>

Founder John Minahan partnered with Swarm to develop ELEV8TE and DV8 caps. Together they spent two years developing, testing, and refining this revolutionary product. This idea came to John while he was on the golf course; he got stuck behind a slow group, and was bored, so he played music on his iPhone and stuffed it under the sweat band of his hat. Voilà! Hats with speakers in the brim were conceived.</p>

Hats/visors


We have production intent prototypes - All the hats and visors shown in the video and images above are working prototypes and finalized designs.
We have been working with United Import Trading Corp. who is a trusted sourcing agent. The designs, materials and styles of the hats/visors are completed and documented. We’ve finalized assembly plan, Quality Control procedures, and production details with the manufacturers.

AMP

We have been working with the factory in Gauangzhou and gone over all production details for the AMP. The AMP in the video and the AMP images are production intent prototypes. We are still fine tuning the AMP design, trying to make it smaller, but other than that it is final.

Who we are?
RESON8TE is a Park City, Utah based company, developing lifestyle products and hi-tech sports gear. Founder John Minahan partnered with Swarm to develop ELEV8TE and DV8 caps. Together they spent two years developing, testing, and refining this revolutionary product. This idea came to John while he was on the golf course; he got stuck behind a slow group, and was bored, so he played music on his iPhone and stuffed it under the sweat band of his hat. Voilà! Hats with speakers in the brim were conceived.
Swarm is product design consultancy located in Salt Lake City, Ut that designs cool products for interesting clients. They work with big and small clients alike to help bring great ideas to life. With experience in design, engineering, sourcing, branding, and product launches, Swarm knows how to make great products a reality. With their specialized experience in audio design, and their love for outdoor sports and music, Swarm was super excited to partner with RESON8TE on this project.
 
Thank you very much! Please pass this along to other people that might benefit from our hats and visors.

idea of <b>Audio-Feel</b> came to us when a friend of ours lost his hearing from a viral infection, and after doing some research found that no commercial device has ever been produced which transforms speech to feel.  The only products
available for the hearing impaired are hearing aids, and cochlear implants. 
In the first case, if someone is completely deaf, it does not work,
and in the second case, it only works if the inner ear still
functions.  In other words someone who is born deaf, or has serious
damage to his inner ear can not be helped.<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A lot of research has been done on the transformation of sound to touch with great results and proof that such a system would work.  Actually, in the research published by <a href=""http://scitation.aip.org/content/contributor/AU0633757"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">P. L. Brooks</a> and <a href=""http://scitation.aip.org/content/contributor/AU0621116"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">B. J.

<p>Please feel free to visit our site <a href=""www.audiofeel.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.audiofeel.info</a> for any further information or details.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/364637/files/20140211190317-TheConcept.jpg?1392174197"" src="""" style=""""/>The concept of <b>Audio-Feel</b> is quite simple.  The ear transforms sound into
nerve stimulating pulses, which end up as neuron data in the brain. 
Why not create the same kind of nerve stimulating pulses through the
skin, so that the brain can feel the sound through the skin, (according to research done by Martin Schurmann ""<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811905024638"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Touch activates human auditory cortex</a>"").<br/>Of
course the ear creates a full spectrum range sound sensation while
our system will only respond to 100 frequencies from the human speech sound
spectrum. The frequency range of human speech covers from 200 Hz to 3500 Hz and vowels have most of their energy lower than 1000 Hz.  </p>
<p>From the research it has been shown that with the stimuli from less than 100 frequency’s
at different intensities, someone who cannot hear, and practices a
bit, will be able to understand someone who is talking to them,
listen to music, and hear surrounding noises while at home or in the
street, who otherwise would never have the opportunity to hear.  The main emphasis will be concentrated on frequencies between 200Hz and 3500Hz as to be able to cover speech as much as possible, as we believe communication is the most important aspect of being able to hear.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/364633/files/20140211190230-TheTech.jpg?1392174150"" src="""" style=""""/>The <b>Audio-Feel</b> technology is quite straight forward. We have designed two systems:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The first system will <b>connect to a Smartphone through
Bluetooth</b>, and using the AudioFeel App, will send surrounding sounds, or
phone conversation to a pin array.</p>
<p>The second system will be an A<b>utonomous
System</b>, which will not need a Smartphone to work. A microphone will
transfer the sound to a Tactile Vocoder.</p>
<p>In both cases the sound will be broken down into
100 different frequencies between 200Hz and 3500Hz, and each of these
frequencies will be transferred to an array of 100 pins, one cm apart from each
other. Each pin will vibrate when its particular frequency is sounded, and will
vibrate more or less depending on the intensity of the sound, (you can imagine
that it would look like a graphic equalizer, only the LED from the graphic
equalizer are pins vibrating on your skin). This array can be strapped onto the
skin, on the wrist (like a watch), or around the abdomen area, and with a little training, someone can learn what each sound feels like and means (it will actually be like learning a new language). Eventually the person using it will be able to repeat sounds and (feel) listen to themselves knowing the sounds they are making are correct. </p>

</div></div>","There are currently over 6.500.000 people around the world who are deaf, and only 500.000 of them have had the financial possibility to proceed with a cochlear implant, which can cost anywhere between $50.000 and $150.000. With Audio-Feel these people can have the possibility to feel the sound and voices around them at a cost between $300 and $700. 
If 0.1% of people who can not hear buy this product in the devloped world and later 0.1% in the rest of the world, we will have made 6.500 peoples lives better!  Our goal is much higher!Let's give them a chance by contributing to this project! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have called this project Audio-Feel, because it does what
it says.  It gives someone the possibility to feel sounds.  This is achieved by using a Tactile Vocoder.The images shown are from a sample unit we designed and built as close to the final autonomous AudioFeel system as possible. Check out our Great Referral Program down the page!!!The
idea of Audio-Feel came to us when a friend of ours lost his hearing from a viral infection, and after doing some research found that no commercial device has ever been produced which transforms speech to feel.  The only products
available for the hearing impaired are hearing aids, and cochlear implants. 
In the first case, if someone is completely deaf, it does not work,
and in the second case, it only works if the inner ear still
functions.  In other words someone who is born deaf, or has serious
damage to his inner ear can not be helped.

A lot of research has been done on the transformation of sound to touch with great results and proof that such a system would work.  Actually, in the research published by P. L. Brooks and B. J. Frost, ""Evaluation of a tactile vocoder for word recognition"", after practicing for close to 55 hours, a person could clearly identify 150 words from the feel of a Tactile Vocoder.  
Please feel free to visit our site www.audiofeel.info for any further information or details.The concept of Audio-Feel is quite simple.  The ear transforms sound into
nerve stimulating pulses, which end up as neuron data in the brain. 
Why not create the same kind of nerve stimulating pulses through the
skin, so that the brain can feel the sound through the skin, (according to research done by Martin Schurmann ""Touch activates human auditory cortex"").Of
course the ear creates a full spectrum range sound sensation while
our system will only respond to 100 frequencies from the human speech sound
spectrum. The frequency range of human speech covers from 200 Hz to 3500 Hz and vowels have most of their energy lower than 1000 Hz.  
From the research it has been shown that with the stimuli from less than 100 frequency’s
at different intensities, someone who cannot hear, and practices a
bit, will be able to understand someone who is talking to them,
listen to music, and hear surrounding noises while at home or in the
street, who otherwise would never have the opportunity to hear.  The main emphasis will be concentrated on frequencies between 200Hz and 3500Hz as to be able to cover speech as much as possible, as we believe communication is the most important aspect of being able to hear.The Audio-Feel technology is quite straight forward. We have designed two systems:


The first system will connect to a Smartphone through
Bluetooth, and using the AudioFeel App, will send surrounding sounds, or
phone conversation to a pin array.
The second system will be an Autonomous
System, which will not need a Smartphone to work. A microphone will
transfer the sound to a Tactile Vocoder.
In both cases the sound will be broken down into
100 different frequencies between 200Hz and 3500Hz, and each of these
frequencies will be transferred to an array of 100 pins, one cm apart from each
other. Each pin will vibrate when its particular frequency is sounded, and will
vibrate more or less depending on the intensity of the sound, (you can imagine
that it would look like a graphic equalizer, only the LED from the graphic
equalizer are pins vibrating on your skin). This array can be strapped onto the
skin, on the wrist (like a watch), or around the abdomen area, and with a little training, someone can learn what each sound feels like and means (it will actually be like learning a new language). Eventually the person using it will be able to repeat sounds and (feel) listen to themselves knowing the sounds they are making are correct. 

                                            
We
have developed a first test prototype of a single line array which vibrates
from 7 different frequencies, and now we want to develop the final
system which will vibrate 100 actuators at different frequencies and intensities.  We will
be developing our own vibrating pin array with actuators, circuitry for the Tactile Vocoder, and App for most smart phones.
We estimate that we
will have the first fully functioning prototypes ready in the middle of 2015.
This what will happen to the Funds that are raised with your help:


Materials and Designs.
Hardware design.
Hardware manufacturing.
Funding for materials cost.

Assembly.
Platform integration and support.
Casing and packaging.
App development.

After funding is complete, we will immediately invest the money to the above expenses. Detailed updates will be sent on completion of each stage, keeping all of you supporters up to date.The World Federation of the Deaf, who has 7 million members, estimates there are 6,5 million people world wide the are completely deaf.  Lets give these people a chance to, if not to hear sound and music, at least feel it!!!We are campaigning with Fixed Funding to inspire trust, as we can only complete the project if it is fully funded, so if you fund us, or help us get funded, you will be part of the community that will give people who can't hear, the possibility to feel sound, which i am quite sure will be quite amazing!!!  If we do not reach our goal of 130.000 Euro you will be fully refunded.

<h3>Car Playlist</h3>
<p>My name is Nikolay Pelov and I'm the CEO of NickSoft Solutions. I was frustrated that I can't sort the songs in my car audio. I decided to make a software that physically organizes the order of files in the filesystem.</p>
<p>How do you play music on your car audio player? You copy it in a USB flash drive, you plug it in and you listen to the songs in the order they are copied. If you get tired of the order you press random. What if you want to add new really cool songs that you want to listen. They get at the end of the list and you never get to listen them. With CarPlaylist you can move the songs to the front of the list and sort them the way you want.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The program is almost ready and beta version is released. It will work just fine as it is, but I want to add new features. The funds that we get from this campaign will decide the time we will spend in developing new features.</p>
<p>You have the chance to buy the program at discount price by choosing some of the perks on the right. There is a limited amount of perks that will give you access to the beta version immediately - no waiting for campaign to finish.</p>
<h3>Planned new features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sort or randomize selection or folder</li>
<li>Prefix all file names with a incremental number for players that play files in alphabetical order</li>
<li>ID3 tag editing for MP3</li>
<li>We will consider feature requests from supporters.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world.</li>
<li>Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one).</li>
<li>Make it real for people and build trust.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The program is quite stable as it is, but as people use it some bugs may be discovered. We will do our best to fix the bugs. The time spent on fixing bugs and adding new features will depend on the funds collected in this campaign. If there are not enough funds it may take more time to fix bugs.</p>
<p>We have ideas of a lot of new features, but we are not sure that they are all possible. One of them is adding one file to multiple directories (playlists) without taking more space. Windows will not be happy about that and may want to ""fix"" the filesystem.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute to the campaign you can help us by spreading the word - share the campaign in facebook, twitter and other social media or link/embed the campaign in your web site. We appreciate it!</p>

<p>Sample Libraries are produced by big companies with huge orchestras, making an enormous sound. That's good, but... But what if a group of composers, producers, engineers and scripters made a boutique sample library that focuses not on the size of the sound, but on the details and liveliness of the samples and on having the best resources in the world involved in terms of Studios, Musicians  in recording a ultra-authentic, realistic, sample library?</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks involved in this campaign are only 2 and we have mitigated both of them to near zero by recording and scripting our prototype. We know exactly what we will encounter, no surprises.</p>
<p><strong>Risk 1 - Being able to record the Samples with the quality we promise and deliver a good product.</strong></p>
<p>We went to the studio with the best musicians in London and recorded a prototype in a session that lasted around 30 minutes. We were rushing a bit and weren't able to get to fine details as you may imagine, but it was enough to understand how we get the sound we want. We think we did a pretty good job on our prototype run, but we also learned what we can improve, so we will be making a killer Sample Library. R&amp;D at work!</p>
<p><strong>Risk 2 - Controlling costs during the execution of the project so we can actually finish.</strong></p>
<p>Our prototype run was also meant to mitigate this risk. We wanted to know exactly how many samples we would be able to record per hour of recording session and how to organize the recording and scores themselves in order to get the best results. We think we did well here too, but we already streamlined the way we write the samples down on the parts in order to both get an even better sound for editing and also to get a more efficient recording session.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Sample Libraries are produced by big companies with huge orchestras, making an enormous sound. That's good, but... But what if a group of composers, producers, engineers and scripters made a boutique sample library that focuses not on the size of the sound, but on the details and liveliness of the samples and on having the best resources in the world involved in terms of Studios, Musicians  in recording a ultra-authentic, realistic, sample library?
You would get 1930's Strings.
Boutique, high quality, affordable and crowdfunded, Samples. No corners cut, no high profit margins. Just a community coming together to fund amazing sample work.

Whether you are driving your car through traffic or walking down the sidewalk, it is essential that you are aware of what is going on around you. Believe it or not, the number of people who have suffered injury or death while wearing headphones has nearly tripled in the last six years. Why? This is because other earphones block out too much external noise. Wearers are unable to hear approaching traffic, warning shouts, car horns, or even an approaching train, causing them to have been badly hurt or even killed. Many lives could have been saved if the victim had heard the warnings. With Harsaa you can enjoy your tunes and still be safe.

<p><strong>Can I use my Harsaa earbuds to protect my hearing from loud volumes?</strong></p>
<p><i>Yes, you can use it as a hearing protection device, allow you to reduce the outside noises entering your ears.</i></p>
<p><strong>Can we control play / pause / next / back on the ear buds?</strong></p>
<p><i>You can assign one earphone for ON/OFF (power function) and pausing music. By tapping Twice, it will ON and do same to OFF. By tapping once, we could pause the music.</i></p>
<p><i>Assign another earphone for Forward/Back function. Tap once or twice to activate the desired function.</i></p>
<p><i>Tap 4 times (any earphone) to activate panic function</i></p>
<p><strong>How long can we use (non-stop playing music) for one full charge? How many times can the case charge the ear buds?</strong></p>
<p><i>Play time is around 3 to 3.5 hours. The charging case delivers 3 times of full charging. The combines play time will be more than 12 hours.</i></p>
<p><strong>What if my Harsaa falls out in the middle of the night? Would I still hear my alarm?</strong></p>
<p><i>They should not fall out if inserted correctly. However, in the off chance that both falls out, the earplugs will know because the user will not turn off the alarm. After 30 seconds of the earplugs' alarm sounding without a response, the system will assume the earplugs have fallen out and begin to sound the smart phone's alarm - which the user should then be able to hear because the earplugs are no longer in the ears.</i></p>

Assign another earphone for Forward/Back function. Tap once or twice to activate the desired function.
Tap 4 times (any earphone) to activate panic function
How long can we use (non-stop playing music) for one full charge? How many times can the case charge the ear buds?
Play time is around 3 to 3.5 hours. The charging case delivers 3 times of full charging. The combines play time will be more than 12 hours.
What if my Harsaa falls out in the middle of the night? Would I still hear my alarm?
They should not fall out if inserted correctly. However, in the off chance that both falls out, the earplugs will know because the user will not turn off the alarm. After 30 seconds of the earplugs' alarm sounding without a response, the system will assume the earplugs have fallen out and begin to sound the smart phone's alarm - which the user should then be able to hear because the earplugs are no longer in the ears.
Can I use Harsaa as Bluetooth headset for phone calls?
Yes, It can be used similar to regular Bluetooth headsets.
Can I use in mono-mode?
Yes, you can use both ear buds individually.
Is there a warranty?
Harsaa will have a one year limited manufacturer warranty.
Is it waterproof?
Yes, Harsaa earbuds are waterproof and sweat proof with IPX-8 waterproof rating for 2 meters water depth.You can even swim with them in.
How many colour options are there?
At present we are planning to have two colors: Black and White. More colors will be introduced according to the demand from backers.",18.0,1,"2 Campaigns

Add your favourite tonearm, create a new damping system or alter the design. The only limit is your imagination.The Kickstarter version of the Lenco-MD is shipped with two empty modular slots. Modules like the Lenco-MD Speaker and Bluetooth Modules are currently in development and will become available after the Kickstarter campaign. Fits in every living room - 7 color optionsThe Lenco-MD Complete Set comes first in seven color variations. A great addition to ever living room. After the Kickstarter campaign a survey is send to specify your color preferences. Build it yourself – A record player out of your 3D printerThe record player of the 21st century is made by you. You can simply 3D print it at home. Just add the quality Lenco hardware and electronics, and have fun building it yourself. No more limitations, you decide the features of your record player.All Lenco-MD frame parts are specifically designed to be 3D Printed on FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) 3D Printers. To 3D Print the entire set it requires a 3D printer with a minimal build volume of 330x330x100 mm.You have a smaller 3D printer? No problem! We have a reward with the pre-printed Platter & Tonearm. All other parts can be printed on a standard FFF 3D printer with a minimal build volume of 200x200x100 mm.No 3D printer? Also no problem! You can get a complete pre-printed Ready-To-Assemble Kit. All parts are printed with high-quality standards, by RepRapUniverse (RRU) at Qeske, The Netherlands. The green record player - made of renewable resourcesThe record player of the 21st century leaves the smallest ecological footprint possible. It is made of PLA, a biodegradable and bioactive thermoplastic. PLA is derived from renewable resources, such as corn starch and sugarcane. Don’t worry, degradation of the material will only occur under certain conditions (right temperature, humidity, bacteria, enzymes).  Made with precision - Quality Lenco partsLenco has been synonymous with Swiss engineering precision in the Hi-Fi and consumer electronics field for more than 70 years. All mechanical and electronics parts in the Lenco-MD are genuine high quality Lenco parts, which results in the iconic and world renowned sound.  Unipivot TonearmThe Lenco-MD comes with a special tonearm, with a visually fascinating mechanical framework. Since the tonearm is perfectly balanced around a unipivot bearing, it does not skew or favor one groove side over the other. It reduces the ubiquitous resonances and frictions to an absolute minimum.There is no need for complex adjustments (anti-skating): The suspended counterweight design and the proportions of the frame around the bearing perfectly balance the horizontal tracking angle.  Cartridge Freedom - Install your favorite cartridgeLenco-MD is shipped with the quality AT3600 cartridge from Audio Technica. You have however, complete freedom to install your favorite cartridge. The handle on the tonearm is flexible and can be equipped with almost any cartridge & stylus available on the market. Vibration Damping Feet Vibration is the enemy of every record player. For the Lenco-MD we came up with a simple, yet effective solution for eliminating and isolating vibration: Soft golf balls. This gives the record player more stability, helps eliminate vibrations and needle skipping.  Belt-drive systemThe Lenco-MD record player uses a belt-drive to spin the platter. An elastic belt is directly attached to the record player’s motor, offering quick and precise movement. The player’s platter rests atop a bearing and is isolated from the devices’ motor. The system absorbs shock, and reduces harsh vibrations generated by the player’s motor. Assembled in a few easy stepsThe Lenco-MD record player is assembled in just a few quick steps. It is not only great fun to it by yourself, you also learn how the record player works. OtherSpeed change is electronic, switch from 33 ⅓ to 45 RPM with the press of a button. The Lenco-MD has a built-in stereo pre-amp and RCA line out port. This lets you connect it to your own audio setup or headphones. A Bluetooth module is set to be developed soon after the Kickstarter campaign. This enables you wireless streaming options.The record player will come with a DC power supply, combined with a power plug that fits your countries’ standard and a battery clip. Additional powering options are currently being developed. You can expect an AccuPack and Solar Charging Module as upgrades soon.

Contact us about becoming a manufacturer and print record players in your store!    The team that is involved with the creation of the Lenco-MD record player is an experienced team of professionals and above all, vinyl lovers. The Lenco-MD turntable is created at the Qeske Community.The Qeske Community is an innovative platform of inventors and creatives. A platform open to ideas, tinkering and education. A place where people, companies and ideas come together in an informal setting. Lenco is a synonym for Swiss engineering precision in the Hi-Fi and consumer electronics field for more than 70 years. RepRapUniverse, a grassroots Dutch 3D printer producer involved in this project has already launched a successful Kickstarter project in 2016 (1730 Full Metal Hotend) and delivering all rewards and most well ahead of schedule. PCiD, a member of Qeske, is a research and development group of experts who joined this project in order to develop a new board for the Lenco-MD.  The first functional prototype of the Lenco-MD was presented at the IFA 2018 Consumer Electronics Faire in Berin, Germany. We were honoured and humbled by the substantial interest for our record player, and by the overall public reaction. It was ranked as one of the top 3 best innovations.",33.0,1,"1 Campaign

Soundfree is a HiFi, wireless and portable multi-protocol audio sender and receiver mini-box s for all your music streaming enjoyment at home or the office, without the hassle of wires or complex playing tasks.
Soundfree was created as a simple solution to send audio wirelessly, not only for short distances, like common Bluetooth A2DP speakers, but also for long distances  as houses, auditoriums, clubs, businesses, and large areas.Once we met our first target, added extra audio protocols as Bluetooth A2DP stereo music,  ,Bluetooth Handsfree , FM  radio tuning,  and DLNA/UPNP, making  Soundfree an All-in-NEOne reception solution. An input jack was added  to send captured audio by Airplay(™), Bluetooth and DLNA too. Don't you have a wifi router ? don't worry ,, Soundfree includes a built-in wifi hotspot mode with own wifi network! , integration with your home router network option is possible too.How it works ? 1.Power on Soundfree.2.Install smartphone application or use web server from any web explorer.3.Connect your smartphone/computer to the built-in soundfreeXXX generated wifi.4.Connect output jack to your HiFi/headphones/etc destination or input jack from the audio source which you want to capture and re-send by Airplay,bluetooth or DLNA.5.Select your required receiver or sender audio mode.6.Enjoy!Use any iMac/PC/Android/iPhone/IOS system to send audio to any destination with a Soundfree unit linked or capture any audio source and send it via Airplay(™),Bluetooth or DLNA/UPNP protocols.Soundfree is a small sized PORTABLE solution that you can power with a universal standard MicroUSB cable or standard 3.7v lithium battery (included on Mini box) . Future upgrade functions or protocols can be implemented (be tuned) .Standard version includes :

100% finished solution&software :Prototype measures 5 cm x 5 cm,.Final unit measurements may increase by approximately  2cm per side.This size change is related to avoid problems massive production issues.


Wifi a/b/g/n built-in hotspot and home router integration modes :Wifi hotspot offers two different connection modes to stream any audio content or to create an intranet and transfer contents between specific devices.


AirPlay  is a proprietary protocolstack/suite developed by Apple Inc.that allows wireless streaming of audio on a wifi network with related metadata between devices , different devices as Android,PC,iOS,iMac,etc.. are able to send Airplay(™) audio contents.Soundfree includes the option of sending and receiving Airplay(™) audio to another Airplay(™) receiver devices/speakers or to a secondary Soundfree unit when it is on airplay receiver mode.




Bluetooth A2DP (Advanced audio distribution profile), allows multimedia audio stream from one device to another over a Bluetooth connection. For example, music can be streamed from a mobile phone to a wireless headset,etc.. Soundfree includes the option of receive or send captured audio to other bluetooth receiver devices or to a secondary Soundfree unit when it is on Bluetooth receiver mode.    


Bluetooth handsfree voice profile, allows individuals who are driving or walking/footing to communicate hands-free with mobile phones or computers.                                                              






FM stereo radio tuner , uses frequency modulation (FM) to provide high-fidelity sound over broadcast radio



Online radio player,is an audio service transmitted via the Internet (requires internet connection).


DLNA/UPNP, enable sharing of digital media between multimedia devices,DLNA has two different types,server and renderer(player),Soundfree includes the option of receiving or sending captured audio to other DLNA receiver devices or to a Soundfree unit when it is on DLNA receiver mode.

<p><strong><i>Who is behind the midiflorian?</i></strong></p>
<p>We are a group of musicians and engineers with decades of electronics and industrial engineering experience. We designed the midiflorian because we had grown frustrated with the expensive, complicated and limited controllers on the market. We were so happy with the result that we knew we had to make it available to everyone.</p>
<p><strong><i>Which midi messages can the midiflorian send?</i></strong></p>
<p>The midiflorian can send any number of the following messages with each press or release of a preset button...</p>
<ul>
<li>Program change</li>
<li>Control change</li>
<li>Note on and off events</li>
<li>Pitch bend change</li>
<li>Polyphonic key pressure (after touch)</li>
<li>Channel pressure (after touch)</li>
<li>All sound off</li>
<li>Reset all controllers</li>
<li>Local control</li>
<li>All notes off</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><i>Why is the midiflorian being sold through Indiegogo?</i></strong></p>
<p>There are two reasons.</p>
<p>The first is that it allows us to take advantage of economies of scale. All the components in the midiflorian can be sourced much cheaper when purchased in bulk. We can then pass the savings on to you and allow us to keep the price of the midiflorian under $200.</p>
<p>The second is that it allows us to provide peace of mind to customers by using a trusted site as well as better support once the orders are shipped.</p>
<p><strong><i>Does the price include shipping?</i></strong></p>
<p>Yes, the listed price does include a courier service to your door. Please note however that your particular country may impose additional taxes or customs duties upon delivery.</p>
<p><strong><i>Does the midiflorian come with a warranty?</i></strong></p>
<p>Yes. While we are certain that the midiflorian is bomb proof, if any component fails under reasonable use within a year of shipping we will work with you to resolve the problem or replace the unit.</p>
<p><strong><i>When will I get my midiflorian?</i></strong></p>
<p>We are ready to place orders with our suppliers the moment the target number of midiflorian orders is met. We expect to ship 6 weeks after the end of the campaign.</p>
<p><strong><i>Is there anything that might delay my order?</i></strong></p>
<p>While extremely rare, it is not unheard of for suppliers to deliver imperfect components to designers like us. We are committed to shipping high quality products so in the unlikely event that we are sent faulty components there may be delays while we rectify the problem.</p>
<p><strong><i>I have another question, can I contact you?</i></strong></p>
<p>Absolutely! In fact we welcome any questions or discussions you may have for us. Get hold of us through the website and we will be sure to answer you.</p>
<p><i><strong>How can I help spread the word about the midiflorian?</strong></i></p>

Which midi messages can the midiflorian send?
The midiflorian can send any number of the following messages with each press or release of a preset button...

Program change
Control change
Note on and off events
Pitch bend change
Polyphonic key pressure (after touch)
Channel pressure (after touch)
All sound off
Reset all controllers
Local control
All notes off

Why is the midiflorian being sold through Indiegogo?
There are two reasons.
The first is that it allows us to take advantage of economies of scale. All the components in the midiflorian can be sourced much cheaper when purchased in bulk. We can then pass the savings on to you and allow us to keep the price of the midiflorian under $200.
The second is that it allows us to provide peace of mind to customers by using a trusted site as well as better support once the orders are shipped.
Does the price include shipping?
Yes, the listed price does include a courier service to your door. Please note however that your particular country may impose additional taxes or customs duties upon delivery.
Does the midiflorian come with a warranty?
Yes. While we are certain that the midiflorian is bomb proof, if any component fails under reasonable use within a year of shipping we will work with you to resolve the problem or replace the unit.
When will I get my midiflorian?
We are ready to place orders with our suppliers the moment the target number of midiflorian orders is met. We expect to ship 6 weeks after the end of the campaign.
Is there anything that might delay my order?
While extremely rare, it is not unheard of for suppliers to deliver imperfect components to designers like us. We are committed to shipping high quality products so in the unlikely event that we are sent faulty components there may be delays while we rectify the problem.
I have another question, can I contact you?
Absolutely! In fact we welcome any questions or discussions you may have for us. Get hold of us through the website and we will be sure to answer you.

The master earbud receives the signal for both sides of the stereo field being transmitted from a smartphone or other device, and re-transmits one side of the signal to the other side, i.e. the ""slave"" earbud. With this system, the master earbud is responsible for both receiving and re-transmitting the audio signal, resulting in higher power consumption than the slave earbud. Hence the battery of the master earbud runs out first, while leaving excess power in the slave earbud. This is why the battery life of true wireless earbuds is shorter than that of traditional wireless in-ear headphones.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538549386/nb5mafcrxg4ad6tburrx.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538402878/mwqfvflulncofxjb4qaj.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The <strong>QCC3206</strong> chip used in the STW-D01a allows the <strong>left</strong> and <strong>right</strong> earbuds to connect in such a way for them to <strong>switch</strong> between the <strong>""master""</strong> and <strong>""slave</strong>"" roles as needed. This results in the <strong>greatest possible efficiency</strong> of the left- and right-side <strong>batteries</strong>.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540566388/v4ijumpyupftjoutr1tv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540087650/ck8qzfdqupoxqmiawpry.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Outstanding Playback Time</strong></h2><p>The STW-D01a can play audio for up to <strong>9 consecutive hours</strong> on a single charge.

We select high-speed, wide-range, high-definition drivers, and conduct extensive listening tests, with painstaking sound tuning performed at increments of 0.1 dB across the entire frequency range. Flat frequency response and balanced tone form the basis of Samurai Ears' approach to sound reproduction. This stands in stark contrast to the in-ear headphones of many brands from other countries that emphasize only the so-called ""heavy-bass"" sound, which can be harsh for ears. 
Key Features and Specs
 State-of-the-Art True Wireless In-Ear Headphones Currently in development at Samurai Ears are the STW-D01a audiophile-grade wireless earbuds. The STW-D01a will be one of the first Japanese products equipped with the latest QCC3026 chip by U.S. based Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.Key features of the STW-D01a can be categorized as follows:1. Extended listening time: Up to 9 hours of staying power with just the earbuds themselves2. No more frustration! Strong, stable Bluetooth signal connection, even in crowded places such as Tokyo. 3. 100% waterproof (IPX7 level) can withstand even temporary immersion in water. Your in-ear headphones will not be damaged by sudden rainfall and sweat.4. Incredible sound quality thanks to the synergy between the outstanding signal processing power of the latest chips and our “Japan Tuned” approach4. Future-proof: Even more features will become accessible with Snapdragon 845 mobile SoC, which is expected to be used in many upcoming Android smartphones and other devices soonLet’s take a closer look at each of these features.  Why do other true wireless in-ear headphones offer so little playback time?In existing true wireless in-ear headphones in the market, either the left or right earbud is set as the ""master."" The master earbud receives the signal for both sides of the stereo field being transmitted from a smartphone or other device, and re-transmits one side of the signal to the other side, i.e. the ""slave"" earbud. With this system, the master earbud is responsible for both receiving and re-transmitting the audio signal, resulting in higher power consumption than the slave earbud. Hence the battery of the master earbud runs out first, while leaving excess power in the slave earbud. This is why the battery life of true wireless earbuds is shorter than that of traditional wireless in-ear headphones. The QCC3206 chip used in the STW-D01a allows the left and right earbuds to connect in such a way for them to switch between the ""master"" and ""slave"" roles as needed. This results in the greatest possible efficiency of the left- and right-side batteries.  Outstanding Playback TimeThe STW-D01a can play audio for up to 9 consecutive hours on a single charge. This is the available playback time after the earbuds are fully charged and does not include any time spent charging them in the battery-powered charging case. When in-case charging time is included, these in-ear headphones provide an impressive maximum playback time of approximately 60 hours.*Playback time may vary due to connection-related conditions and playback volume. The above data are provided as a general guideline.  Superior Connection StabilityIn addition to continuous playback time being far from ideal, there is another issue with existing true wireless earbuds: Intermittent connections. Even if 100% uninterrupted connections are just a dream for wireless products, fewer interruptions are certainly preferable. Thanks to the cutting-edge QCC3026 chip, the STW-D01a gets a much better reception than devices that use previous versions of chips. Additionally, the STW-D01a's connection performance is further enhanced by our new approach on antenna placement.Prototype to check the connection stability in Tokyo  Sound First Since its launch, the Samurai Ears has consistently taken a ""by Japan, for the world"" approach in acoustic design. We call this approach ""Japan Tuned,"" and are fully committed to it. Our rigorous quality control extends to the factories where our products are made. The STW-D01a's sound has been painstakingly tuned through close listening tests by some of Japan's top audio experts, using roughly 3,000 music pieces ranging from classics to the latest hits.  Superior high quality sound codec When connected to a compatible device, such as an Android device, playback with the high-quality aptX audio codec is available. Compared to the standard SBC codec, aptX uses a lower compression ratio when transmitting audio, allowing users to play music without significantly decreasing the quality of the sound. At Samurai Ears, we are particular about sound quality, and we consider aptX to be the ideal codec.The STW-D01a is also compatible with the SBC codec, as well as the AAC format. Please rest assured that we have also performed careful tuning to ensure that the STW-D01a's sound quality meets your expectations in regard to these codecs. Bluetooth 5.0The STW-D01a is compatible with Bluetooth version 5.0, which is now being included with the latest smartphone models. The result is a marked improvement in data speed and range when connected to a compatible device, making your wireless audio experience that much more enjoyable. Of course, the STW-D01a is also backward compatible with devices that support earlier versions of Bluetooth. Ease of UseWithout the need of control via your smartphones, just by touching buttons on each of the left and right earbuds, you can play or pause your music, and skip tracks.Prototype to check the connection stability in Tokyo. Siri and Google assistant available  Fast ChargingCharging only for 15 mins, you can playback your music for 80 mins.  Superior Water ResistanceThe STW-D01a’s IPX7-compliant waterproofing can withstand even temporary immersion in water. Your in-ear headphones will not be damaged by sudden rainfall and sweat.  Bombproof Durable Metal Case with High Capacity BatteryThe charging case is made in durable and long-lasting duralumin. And, with built-in a high capacity (800mAh) lithium-ion battery, you can charge the earbuds about 6 times. So you can enjoy listening to music for approximately 60 hours on the go. 4 colors available.Prototypes Hidden FeaturesBoth the STW-01a and the QCC3026 chip actually have capabilities that have yet to be fully unleashed.

<p><b>1. How can I choose color of my Quad.ly?</b></p>
<p>Initially Quad.ly is available in two colors - Charcoal and Smoke White. After achieving a stretch goal <i>""Bring colors to your life!""</i> Quad.ly will be available in all listed colors. By the end of campaign we will send out via e-mail a form to each contributor in which one of the questions will be about the color.</p>

<p><b>3. What headphones can I use with my Quad.ly?</b></p>
<p>Quad.ly auto-senses and supports virtually all headphones that are equipped with 3.5mm headphones jack. This includes stereo headphones without a microphone (3-pole plug) and stereo headphones with microphone (4-pole plug) in two available standards - OMTP (L, R, Mic, Gnd) e.g. Nokia, old Samsung - and - CTIA/AHJ (L, R, Gnd, Mic) e.g. Apple, Blackberry, new Samsung, HTC, etc. Also volume of each Quad.ly output can be independently adjusted for different types of headphones. After achieving a <i>""Talk to me!""</i> stretch goal Quad.ly is going to support built in microphones of the above described headphone types.</p>
<p><b>4. Does Quad.ly have independent headphones amplifiers?</b></p>
<p>Yes, each output has a dedicated headphones amplifier with independent volume control. Quad.ly uses Class-G 25mW headphones amplifiers designed for mobile applications.</p>
<p><b>5. What is the battery life of Quad.ly?</b></p>
<p>The fully charged single battery version is estimated to run 5h+ with four pairs of headphones connected with maximum power. The <i>""Longer, longer, longer...""</i> achievement means that time doubles to 10h+.</p>
<p><b>6. Can I pair my Quad.ly with more than one device simultaneously?</b></p>
<p>Yes, your Quad.ly can be simultaneously paired with two devices, e.g. smartphone and tablet. Quad.ly will pick the paired device that actually streams the audio. </p>
<p><b>7. What is the color of built-in flashlight?</b></p>
<p>We have picked the best one -  warm white, similar to daylight! :-)  You'll get it after the <i>""Light up the World!"" </i>stretch goal is achieved.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>The anticipated risks are low. The only risk forecasted is a possible slight delay in the starting shipping date due to unforeseeable circumstances that may happen. </p>
<p>We will make every effort to fulfill the commitments and deliver your Quad.ly on time.<br/></p>
</div></div>","Quad.ly is a wireless keychain pendant that makes sharing your music and audio a snap! 
Its innovative design packs four built-in (3.5mm) outlets that give you and your friends independent control of the same audio source. From music to movies, Quad.ly provides unprecedented flexibility, and it works with headphones you already have. But we’re not stopping there! We’re building in more features like group talk capability, wireless music streaming, an integrated LED flashlight and much more!

The keychain pendant above is something I was looking for long time... and could not find on the market. I travel quite extensively with companions (traveling alone is not fun for me) and in many, many occasions wanted to watch the same movie on my iPad with folks sitting at the same row in the airplane. There are some lousy headphones splitters for two, limiting the number of people included and giving bad performance as two pairs of headphones are powered from one amplifier. Also both cables have to be connected to the device making the cables too short... 

I wanted something that could be always with me, ready to be used during the trip, a device that would provide superior quality and user experience.  
Early 2015 - the idea was born, soon followed by first sketches and 'must have' features definition. I have spent countless hours on the design and prototype to make sure the final device - Quad.ly - will fulfill the requirements of the most demanding users.


The Quad.ly can be described in three short sentences:

Be inclusive!  Share moments!  Have fun together! 
You and your friends can now use your favorite headphones that you already have. With Quad.ly you avoid investing into new costly headphones. You can also connect to devices without 3.5mm jack but with Bluetooth.
It is all about sharing moments with loved ones and friends in public space. You can think of countless occasions to enjoy with Quad.ly - when you are using public transportation, when you are at school or university or walk in the park.
The idea was born because of  travel and you can use Quad.ly in airplanes, coaches and buses but also for example to allow your kids at the back seat of your car to watch the same cartoon or movie on one tablet, with cables only between them.
Do you have a TV set equipped with Bluetooth? Now you can watch movies at night together when kids sleep.
Have you ever thought of inviting strangers to listen to your music or watch movies with you in the waiting room or at the airport? That could be lots of fun... :-)
From now on you can play ""name that tune"" anywhere!
After achieving the ""Talk to me!"" stretch goal you will be able to have a group talk over the phone in public space without a speakerphone. This feature can be useful also at work when e.g. mentor supervises a mentee speaking to the customer.
One of the most interesting features of Quad.ly is ability to wirelessly stream music to your home audio system via docking station. Just detach your Quad.ly from the keyring, dock it, seat at your couch, play music from your smartphone and enjoy the moment :-) You will be able to do it after ""The full option Quad.ly"" stretch goal is achieved.
Don't forget about the available colors and flashlight that will be always with you! 



I bet you ask yourself ""Why I had to wait for it soooo long ?""  ;-)




Quad.ly is designed in a simplistic and compact way. The number of features available  depends on the stretch goal achieved. Please refer to the ""Stretch Goals"" section for further reference.




The compact case in form of a keychain pendant allows you to plug up to four standard headphones to color coded outputs. All of the outputs have the same functionalities. 
Quad.ly has 1 switch and 3 buttons:

- The ""On/Off/Mode switch"" can be set in three positions

Middle position -  flashlight. All electronics is turned off.
Bluetooth position - normal mode. 
USB position - Quad.ly operates as an USB sound-card with four outputs available.


- The '+' is a Volume Up button - it increases volume of indicated output.

- The '−' is a Volume Down button - it decreases volume of indicated output.
- The 'Output Selector' button has several functions: 



It turns on the flashlight when switch is in the middle position. 


It chooses the output to be controlled or group of outputs when switch is in Bluetooth position.


It is used to force the Bluetooth pairing.




- The Bluetooth status LED - blinks blue when Quad.ly works in Bluetooth mode. Blinking frequency depends on a current state.
- The Output indicator LED emits:



Green light when green output volume is controlled.  


Blue light when blue output volume is controlled. 


Yellow light when yellow output volume is controlled.  


Red light when red output volume is controlled.  


White light when all outputs volumes are controlled at the same time.


Quad.ly comes in two basic colors - white smoke and charcoal. The additional colors will be available after reaching relevant stretch goal.



The Docking station for Quad.ly has two connectors - Micro-USB and 3.5mm jack. After being docked Quad.ly gets automatically charged over the Micro-USB port. 



To detach the cap it is needed to push cap detach button with a fingernail. This will move internal springs and release the cap.








Please spread the news about Quad.ly!



Let your friends know about it!



The more people the better!











            ""Simplicity is a virtue.""
The above sentence describes the best the approach that lead to final goal.Starting from the logo with shape of capital letter 'Q' that depicts four separate rings but single waveform of sound reaching those. 


This is the essence of Quad.ly a consumer-grade piece of electronics that allows to share moments with friends and loved ones. Something that enables you to experience a joy of being together in situations that usually forced you to isolate yourself.

This includes stereo headphones without a microphone (3-pole plug) and stereo headphones with microphone (4-pole plug) in two available standards - OMTP (L, R, Mic, Gnd) e.g. Nokia, old Samsung - and - CTIA/AHJ (L, R, Gnd, Mic) e.g. Apple, Blackberry, new Samsung, HTC, etc. Also volume of each Quad.ly output can be independently adjusted for different types of headphones. After achieving a ""Talk to me!"" stretch goal Quad.ly is going to support built in microphones of the above described headphone types.
4. Does Quad.ly have independent headphones amplifiers?
Yes, each output has a dedicated headphones amplifier with independent volume control. Quad.ly uses Class-G 25mW headphones amplifiers designed for mobile applications.
5. What is the battery life of Quad.ly?
The fully charged single battery version is estimated to run 5h+ with four pairs of headphones connected with maximum power. The ""Longer, longer, longer..."" achievement means that time doubles to 10h+.
6. Can I pair my Quad.ly with more than one device simultaneously?
Yes, your Quad.ly can be simultaneously paired with two devices, e.g. smartphone and tablet. Quad.ly will pick the paired device that actually streams the audio. 
7. What is the color of built-in flashlight?
We have picked the best one -  warm white, similar to daylight! :-)  You'll get it after the ""Light up the World!"" stretch goal is achieved.

Risks
The anticipated risks are low. The only risk forecasted is a possible slight delay in the starting shipping date due to unforeseeable circumstances that may happen. 
We will make every effort to fulfill the commitments and deliver your Quad.ly on time.",20.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>PYOUR® Audio - Rediscover your music!</h3>
<p><i>PYOUR Audio</i> is all about music. Music is emotion. And emotion is at the core of our being. Your ears are the receptors of the emotion in music. As you grow past your twenties, your ears may perform not as well as they used to. Your hearing ability simply does change over time and music will start to sound different. This process may have taken place so slowly that you’ve never really noticed it. Until it hits you that you’ve not been listening to your favorite tunes for a while…<br/> </p>
<h3>How your hearing affects your music experience</h3>
<p>When you suffer from a change in your hearing ability, whether through hearing damage or age, your perception of sound changes. You may not have realized it, but from your perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s as if you’ve been listening to a bad mix</li>
<li>Or as if you’ve been listening to a poor music player device</li>
<li>In any way: music doesn’t trigger your emotion, it doesn’t reach your soul.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may not be ready to accept that your hearing may have changed over the years. Face it, live concerts (even acoustic!), music festivals, headphone use, music cafés, any other loud sounds and last but not least: <u>time</u> has had an effect on your hearing. Whether you realize it or not. Not sure?<br/>Ask yourself: When was the last time music really moved you? Are you listening to music less often than you used to? Do songs sounds differently, maybe flatter as you remembered them? Be ready to find out what real personal sound can do for you.<br/> </p>
<h3>So what is <i>PYOUR Audio</i> then?</h3>
<p>Check out this video where Aernout Arends of Absolute Audio Labs explains the history, conception and features of <i>PYOUR Audio</i>.</p>

<p><i>PYOUR Audio</i> is basically a set of really smart headphones. The hardware is manufactured by <i>Parrot</i> (Zik 3). But it contains a special firmware that lets you do all kinds of cool things that you've not been able to do with any headphone before.  It adapts the sound to your hearing ability, so you will hear music as it is meant to sound. Regardless of how well you can still hear. Just test your hearing via a simple but super accurate hearing test and the app will then calculate the best sound setting for you and program it into the headphones. You will not believe the detail of music that you can hear! Start rediscovering your music!</p>
<p>But that's not all. You can read out the sound level that you are exposing your ears to. And have the headphones limit this sound exposure. In volume, but you can also limit exposure in time. This feature will help you protect your hearing against noise induced hearing loss.<br/>You can also amend the frequency response of the headphones to your personal preference and taste. And set a compensation for balance and mono sound. Inside the headphones.</p>

For all the gory details see the datasheet at Dream.Fluxamasynth 32All of the other modules require some sort of Arduino or Raspberry Pi to act as the control module. The Fluxamasynth 32 has a nice ESP32 microcontroller baked right on board so it is an all-in-one solution. The ESP32 can be programmed using the Arduino IDE and has Wifi and Bluetooth capabilities, so these nodes can talk to each other over the network. You'll also need a USB BUB or FTDI cable for programming; if you don't have one there's a bundle in the perks section.Fluxamasynth for Raspberry PiThe Fluxamasynth Pi fits the Raspberry Pi Zero and can be programmed using Python or a simple IDE based on Google's Blockly Scratch-like interface. Great for music making in the classroom.Fluxamasynth for Adafruit FeatherThis Fluxamasynth variation fits the footprint of Adafruit's Feather platform, which offers a consistent interface that's an affordable alternative to other boards. You can choose male or female headers, and screw terminals are available from Modern Device.The Feather platform has several options for microcontrollers; there are versions with an Atmega32u, ESP32, or ARM M0 processor. This works out of the box with all three of these variants of Feather. Some Feather boards also have Bluetooth or RFM69 or LoRa radios. For many of the Feather boards you'll want female headers and place the Fluxamasynth on the bottom since you'll need access to some of the buttons and LEDs on top of the Feather controller.Fluxamasynth for Feather (with optional screw terminals, left) and the same board with an Adafruit Feather M0 on top.Programming the FluxamasynthThe SAM2695 chip that does all the work is hooked up to the serial transmit (TX) line  of the microcontroller; making music is as easy as sending a set of MIDI-formatted bytes to the chip. We've made a Fluxamasynth Arduino library to make this easy. Here's a very simple example using the library:IHere's a more complex example of a 40 minute algorithmic composition that comes bundled with the library: Terry Riley's ""In C"" for Arduino.The Fluxamasynth BookOne of the goals of this campaign is to collect all of the library documentation into one large reference, the Fluxamasynth Book. The book will cover software and hardware, and will show how to hook up pots, buttons, sensors, and alternative input devices. It will also definitively cover the generative music aspects of the library, which can be used to create algorithmic musical appliances.Design Files and CodeAll of the design files are open source, released under a CERN Open Hardware license and available on Github:https://github.com/fluxly/Fluxamasynth-DesignsThe Fluxamasynth library is released under the MIT open source license and is also on Github.https://github.com/fluxly/FluxamasynthFluxamasynth and Modern DeviceI designed the original Fluxamasynth Arduino shield in 2010 as part of my final project for the Fab Academy, a digital fabrication program we were teaching here at the AS220 community arts center in Providence RI. Later we started making and selling the Fluxamasynth as a product of Modern Device, which is now part of the AS220 Industries, an umbrella program for the AS220 Fab Lab, Media Lab and Printshop. I'm personally running this Indiegogo to get development and documentation of these new variations up and running, after which they will be available as products of Modern Device (and hopefully other resellers). In the meantime, the original Fluxamasynth Arduino shield is still available today at moderndevice.com/fluxamasynth.Fluxamasynth Shield (left). Ed Potokar makes beautiful instruments (right), some of which are powered by the Fluxamasynth.",9.0,2,"1 Campaign

<b>It's not an amp, it's a living sculpted art that sings!</b>

<i>""I just took delivery of my BT6 with speakers and subwoofers. Although still need to be 'cooked' but the sound is very promising. The craftsmanship is outstanding. I would consider even buying a second set for my other home. It's so beautifully crafted that I nice fountain pen would be more expensive than this. This will immediately transform any living room or study into a contemporary art gallery and will become the centre piece of attention the minute you enter the room. It has lasting values and the fact that it sounds so good is just icing on the cake. The touch and smell of solid wood plus the natural wood grain pattern ensures no two amps or speakers are ever the same in this world. Every single piece is unique and there's only one in the world that looks like it, that's your's. it's an instant classic and the ultimate limited edition. Truly a world class product that would brighten anyone's musical life. I use the iPad to watch concerts of my favorite singers in my study and its sounds just like you a having a private concert, how good is that?! Totally recommended. If you were wondering if it is as good as it looks - I can tell you now, it's not. It's far far better!""</i>

Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the lack of AM/FM tuner. I knew in advance it didn't have one, but it would have been nice. (Internet radio and bluetooth connection are an easy work around).

The wood is warm and timeless, and in addition to sounding great, the tubes start a conversation with anyone who visits. The speakers are clear and warm, and the subwoofer is tight and musical without being muddy. I use a media streamer as source, but the blue tooth has been useful when a friend wants me to hear something new on their phone. Was it worth the money?

<p></p></div>","True analog sound, the way it is supposed to beThis hand built tube amplifier will look amazing and sound unbelievable in your office or home. The 3/4"" thick walnut and cherry enclosures are hand rubbed with linseed oil, then waxed. Reminiscent of audio equipment built 50 years ago by a craftsman, the retro feel of the exposed tubes distinguish a tube amplifier from any other type of audio player. When the lights are turned down, the tubes themselves produce a warm glow that makes this sound system stand out from all the rest. This is a system you will be proud to display and could well be in your family for generations.

All BlueTube Amplifiers are hand built here in Franklin, Indiana using a proven circuit design and all natural materials.  Each unit is individually numbered and built to the highest standards.Ben and Adam have spent many hours perfecting this design and making it a truly one of a kind unit.We could go on and on about the design process but I think some pictures will tell the story much better:Each unit is hand waxed and buffed to perfectionI think we did it right!Brothers, Ben and Adam, started Blue Tube Audio about a year and a half ago and have had great success.  After our last campaign we had many people request a unit that could handle 110V or the international standard 220 volts. It's for this reason we wanted to introduce the BT-6 Amplifier.This new unit will work in the US and Canada as well as the rest of the world.Want to know you can trust us?This is our third crowd-funding project we are introducing.  Our first project was the ClockOS project. We were able to deliver all rewards in a timely fashion and have continued to sell these unique clocks to individuals after the Kickstarter program.  Our second project was the BT-4 BlueTube Amplifier and we had outstanding feedback on that unit.  Another great thing about our project is that everything is proudly made and hand-crafted right here in the USA. No offshore assembly or construction on our BlueTube amps. Also you can call us and talk to us if you want 1-317-738-4474What We Need & What You GetWhy Crowd-funding again?
We need to raise enough money to make orders for all the sheet metal, milled parts, electronics, printed circuit boards, etc.

We need to purchase new commercial grade tools to increase production.

We have the location of a new larger shop but it needs new environmental control equipment before we can move in.







Our Spotify Rewards Playlist, enjoy!

Power Switch - ON/OFF Positions. Blue LED ring indicates power is on. 

Volume Knob - Controls volume level, turn clockwise to turn the volume up, reverse direction to reduce the volume.

It's not an amp, it's a living sculpted art that sings!


""I just took delivery of my BT6 with speakers and subwoofers. Although still need to be 'cooked' but the sound is very promising. The craftsmanship is outstanding. I would consider even buying a second set for my other home. It's so beautifully crafted that I nice fountain pen would be more expensive than this. This will immediately transform any living room or study into a contemporary art gallery and will become the centre piece of attention the minute you enter the room. It has lasting values and the fact that it sounds so good is just icing on the cake. The touch and smell of solid wood plus the natural wood grain pattern ensures no two amps or speakers are ever the same in this world. Every single piece is unique and there's only one in the world that looks like it, that's your's. it's an instant classic and the ultimate limited edition. Truly a world class product that would brighten anyone's musical life. I use the iPad to watch concerts of my favorite singers in my study and its sounds just like you a having a private concert, how good is that?! Totally recommended. If you were wondering if it is as good as it looks - I can tell you now, it's not. It's far far better!""

Proud new owner!""This is quite simply the finest audio equipment i have ever bought. The sound is sensational and it looks awesome in my library.""Dermott M.2014-02-06Blue tube amp""Bought this amp, it is really nice looking and works with any decor you put it in. I don't care if you have a modern, colonial, or rustic decor vibe, this amp looks great where ever it is. Personally I can't tell the difference between a tube amp and transistor amp…..if you can, great, if not, then this sounds fantastic all the same. Buy it for looks and hand it down to your grandchildren.""John H.2014-04-18
A piece of art""I bought the speakers and sub-woofer with my amp, the sound is very rich. The sub-woofer adds wonderful depth. It's so nice to finally hear all the sounds and instruments in songs I've listened to for years (a big step up from my Bose SoundWave radio). I'm re-discovering my old music again! Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the lack of AM/FM tuner. I knew in advance it didn't have one, but it would have been nice. (Internet radio and bluetooth connection are an easy work around). Lots of ohs and awes from people who see it in my living room, still more once they hear it.""Simon B.2014-02-25
Exactly what I wanted - beautiful in every way.""I wanted a small system with distinctive looks and a rich sound, and I couldn't be more pleased. The wood is warm and timeless, and in addition to sounding great, the tubes start a conversation with anyone who visits. The speakers are clear and warm, and the subwoofer is tight and musical without being muddy. I use a media streamer as source, but the blue tooth has been useful when a friend wants me to hear something new on their phone. Was it worth the money? I use it every day and every day it makes me happy. Yes, it was worth the money. Thanks for a great addition to my home!""

Fantastic!!!“Took a
while to get here (international shipping, clearing customs, etc, etc), but
couldn't be happier!! Absolutely gorgeous, the sound is fantastic. Can see
myself coming back to you for the subwoofer once I move into more space. Thank
you for taking the time and effort to produce something beautiful! I love it!!”Chris M.2014-14-22

They are great for discovery but not so great for an immersive album experience. Add to that you’re most likely listening to music on a multi-use smart device, where it’s competing with other apps, feeds, notifications and so on. Album artwork, the original and most authentic presentation of music, has been miniaturised and compromised in the transition to digital. Whether or not you remember the heyday of vinyl or even CD, albums have always come with extra stuff that you've been missing. Sleevenote wants to lead the digital album artwork revolution. The deviceA retina-standard touch screen for incredible colours and print-like definition. Dedicated playback buttons keep the user interface away from the artwork. Durable injection moulded case with comfortable rounded edges.  Bigger than a CD, nearly the size of a 7"" record. Works with your music As well as being a stand-alone music vault for your owned music (for example WAVs, FLACs or MP3s from Bandcamp), Sleevenote will support music from the major streaming platforms Apple Music and Spotify, with more to be added on demand. Technical specificationsInside the device is everything needed for a portable standalone music experience.

During our final design for manufacture stage, specifications may change slightly, as every possible improvement is explored. We will post regular updates during this process. Cost BreakdownWe have thoroughly costed the product with the help from experienced industry professionals. Ensuring each stage runs as smoothly as possible.We will be working with product and manufacturing experts to refine the design and optimise our manufacturing and assembly process to a very high standard, this is an absolute priority for us. As a new device, here's how the price compares to music players and tablets on the market. Why is our goal so high?You've probably noticed our goal is much higher than most crowdfunding campaigns. The simple reason for this is that we need to make a minimum order of 1,000 units for our custom high-resolution square screen. This is not an off-the-shelf part, it is the holy grail for the product's existence, and it is also the reason for its premium price. For us it all adds to the excitement and challenge of bringing a truly unique product to life.We're running an all-or-nothing campaign, meaning if it does get funded, we can definitely deliver this product to our backers.  Timeline
  We are committed to delivering your Sleevenote by October 2021  The Sleevenote databasePowering the device is the Sleevenote database, which currently contains over 1,000 interactive back covers and booklet artwork images. Connecting the database to the software is the Sleevenote API, which allows the app to request new artwork when required.Our online design tool allows designers and fans to upload album art for the releases they love. Once approved, their submitted artwork will automatically show up in the device and apps for everyone to enjoy. The free appRepresenting over 6 years of researching and testing interactive album art solutions, those who prefer to ""bring their own device"" can experience Sleevenote for free on iPad.

Moving the frequency splitting function from the high voltage post-amplifier domain to the low voltage line level domain allows the lowest distortion signal to reach the amplifier, and the amplifier to directly control the drivers. <i><strong>The result is a breathtaking increase in audio clarity, definition and warmth, the likes of which most have never heard before.</strong></i></p><p> </p><h3><strong><i>3rd Generation K231 Active Crossover</i></strong></h3><p>We've shipped our first couple hundred K231 Active Crossovers! And we've received rave reviews for the boost in sound quality our customers have experienced. Interest in the K231 is growing fast, and we want to ramp up production of our new 3rd generation design in a big way to support the growing market.</p><p> </p><h3><strong><i>What's New &amp; Improved in the 3rd Gen K231?</i></strong></h3><p>We've had great customer feedback from our initial two generations of the K231 over this past year. But we always want to keep moving forward to improve the sound quality in every way we can. In this past year we've talked to many of our customers, and we've learned much about our customers' priorities. We've distilled all that we've learned into this new 3rd Gen K231 design.</p><p> </p><h3><i><strong>The upgrades you'll find in the 3rd Gen K231 include:</strong></i></h3><p>We replaced the old 'wall wart' style power supply with a high quality, low noise internal bi-polar analog power supply with a total of 20,000uF of filter cap and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu-metal"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mu-metal</a> transformer shielding. This new power supply gives a massive improvement in the clarity, definition and 'punch' of the low end, as well as improved definition up through the higher registers. And the Mu-metal shielding prevents transformer electrical noise from coupling into the audio path.</p><p>Changing to this bi-polar power supply allowed us to make other major improvements to the balanced signal input and output circuitry, which improved the noise rejection ratio by over 20dB.</p><p>We've also added improved support for selection of 2-way or 3-way crossover modes. We've replaced the old method with a simple slide switch to easily select the mode. This also fixes an issue where the sub-woofer mixer was not available in 2-way mode.</p><p>And lastly, the audio input stage component values have been more finely tuned for <strong><i>the purest and most detailed and natural sound you can imagine</i></strong>.</p><p> </p><h3><strong><i>What is it? What does it do? Why do I need it?</i></strong></h3><p>The K231 Stereo Active Crossover is a low cost component you can add to your stereo system that will give you a massive boost in sound quality. The K231 significantly improves the audio quality of your sound system by separating the high, mid and low frequency sounds using ultra low noise, high precision analog active filter circuits in place of the passive crossovers inside your speaker cabinets. <i><strong>The result is a transformational improvement in the level of clarity and definition of the sound produced.</strong></i> This is called <i><strong>Active Bi-Amping</strong></i>. You can read all about the <a href=""https://sublimeacoustic.com/products/k231-stereo-3-way-active-crossover"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">K231 specs, features and customer reviews here</a>. And check out the links below for more in-depth information on the many benefits of active bi-amping.</p><p>Professional sound studios have used active bi-amping exclusively for over 30 years. But this technology has been very slow to migrate into consumer audio, even at the high end, due to the extremely high cost of currently available electronic active crossovers and the deep entrenchment of the status quo passive systems.</p><p>Our goal with the K231 has always been to bring the benefits of high quality analog active bi-amping into the price range that is affordable to average audiophiles. The K231 uses the highest quality audiophile grade components, and has specs that easily match those of the much higher priced electronic crossovers such as Bryston and Marchand, but without the huge price tag. The <a href=""http://www.bryston.com/products/other/10B-STD.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bryston 10B</a> starts at about $3000. The <a href=""http://www.marchandelec.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Marchand </a>crossovers are also in the $2000-$3000 range. The K231 gives the same performance benefits as these units, but at a fraction of the price.</p><p>Several of our customers are professional audio engineers, and they've done head-to-head listening comparisons between the K231 and both the Bryston and Marchand units. All of the reports so far have indicated <strong><i>the K231 matches or even exceeds the clarity and definition of these much higher priced units</i></strong>.</p><p> </p><h3><i><strong>Why Are We Launching this Campaign?</strong></i></h3><p>Over the past year we have boot-strapped the funding for the production of the K231. But with interest in the new 3rd Gen K231 now growing so rapidly, we cannot continue boot-strapping. We need to launch an Indiegogo to raise the capital to properly fund a large production run.</p><p> </p><h3><i>Campaign Perks &amp; Discounts:</i></h3><p>Once we're in full production, the K231 will retail for $499. But in our Indiegogo campaign we're offering the K231 at deep discounts as an incentive for backing our campaign. In this campaign you can receive a K231 at a 20%-30% discount. And to get the ball rolling, we're also allowing the first 10 Super Early Bird backers to receive a K231 unit at a 30% discount PLUS free worldwide shipping! And lastly, for dealers, we're offering package deals up to 35% discount.</p><p> </p><h3><i><strong>How Would I Integrate the K231 into My Sound System?</strong></i></h3><p>The K231 Active Crossover is wired in-line between your preamp's line level signal outputs and your amplifier inputs. And your amplifier outputs drive your woofer, mid-range, and tweeter speaker drivers directly, bypassing your existing passive crossovers.</p><p>There are a few implications to this. For active bi-amping, you need one amplifier channel per speaker driver. e.g. If you have 3-way speakers, you would need a total of 6 amplifier channels to power the 3 speaker drivers in each of the left and right channels. Note that the extra cost of the added amp channels is literally the only downside to active bi-amping. It costs a little more, but trust me, the sound quality is well worth it!</p><p>Since the K231 inserts in-line between the preamp outputs and amplifier inputs, your system would need to have these connections available for re-wiring. Some integrated amplifiers have the preamp outputs connected to the amp inputs internally, without external jacks connecting them. This type of integrated preamp/amp would not be compatible with the K231. But if your system includes discrete preamp signal output jacks that connect to your amplifier inputs, then this would be compatible with the K231. The K231 is also compatible with any DAC or other audio source such as smart phones or portable audio players.</p><p>You will also need to have the capability to bypass the passive crossovers in your speaker cabinets. Many modern speaker systems are already set up to allow active bi-amping by providing individual speaker terminals for the woofer,  and tweeter channels. These two sets of terminals are normally tied together with heavy bus bars. You would only need to remove those bus bars to enable your speakers to be used with the K231. But many of our customers opt to physically remove the passive XO's entirely from their speaker cabinets to get the best possible sound quality. And still others opt to build their own speakers from the ground up! How far you want to go to get the best possible sound really just comes down to your level of DIY skills and your courage!</p><p>To install the K231, simply unplug your preamp outputs from your amplifier and plug them into the K231 inputs instead. And plug additional cables from the K231 outputs to your amplifier's input jacks, one set for each of your speaker drivers.</p><p> </p><h3><i><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges:</strong></i></h3><p>We realize a lot of people are nervous about crowd funding. People have heard the horror stories of campaigns that have been funded, but then never followed through and delivered the rewards. Many campaigns want people to back them at pre-production stages. And sometimes even pre-design stages. These are definitely risky, with way too many variables. But we really believe our campaign is different. We have a mature design, with a hundreds of units in the field, and no unhappy customers that we’re aware of. And the reviews for our latest 3rd gen design are coming in very strong, <a href=""https://sublimeacoustic.com/products/k231-stereo-3-way-active-crossover"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">almost universally enthusiastically positive</a>. We believe our campaign is very low risk. The only risk is if the parts are not available due to back order or some other unforeseen delay. And we’ll move heaven and earth to find the shorted parts or address any delays to make sure that doesn’t happen! If you back our campaign, you can be assured we will do our level best to ship your K231 on schedule.</p><p> </p><h3><i><strong>45 Day No-Hassle Return:</strong></i></h3><p>And if for some reason you're not happy with your K231, you can return it for a full refund within 45 days, no questions asked.</p><p> </p><h3><i><strong>Help Us Bring the 3rd Gen K231 to the Next Level!</strong></i></h3><p>We hope you'll support our campaign. We gotta reach our goal within the 30 day window, and it's all or nothing. Please help us spread the word ASAP by re-posting on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or the social media of your choice. And if you're active in an audiophile club or message board, we hope you'll put in a good word for us :)</p><p> </p><h3><i><strong>More Info:</strong></i></h3><ul>

And to get the ball rolling, we're also allowing the first 10 Super Early Bird backers to receive a K231 unit at a 30% discount PLUS free worldwide shipping! And lastly, for dealers, we're offering package deals up to 35% discount. How Would I Integrate the K231 into My Sound System?The K231 Active Crossover is wired in-line between your preamp's line level signal outputs and your amplifier inputs. And your amplifier outputs drive your woofer, mid-range, and tweeter speaker drivers directly, bypassing your existing passive crossovers.There are a few implications to this. For active bi-amping, you need one amplifier channel per speaker driver. e.g. If you have 3-way speakers, you would need a total of 6 amplifier channels to power the 3 speaker drivers in each of the left and right channels. Note that the extra cost of the added amp channels is literally the only downside to active bi-amping. It costs a little more, but trust me, the sound quality is well worth it!Since the K231 inserts in-line between the preamp outputs and amplifier inputs, your system would need to have these connections available for re-wiring. Some integrated amplifiers have the preamp outputs connected to the amp inputs internally, without external jacks connecting them. This type of integrated preamp/amp would not be compatible with the K231. But if your system includes discrete preamp signal output jacks that connect to your amplifier inputs, then this would be compatible with the K231. The K231 is also compatible with any DAC or other audio source such as smart phones or portable audio players.You will also need to have the capability to bypass the passive crossovers in your speaker cabinets. Many modern speaker systems are already set up to allow active bi-amping by providing individual speaker terminals for the woofer,  and tweeter channels. These two sets of terminals are normally tied together with heavy bus bars. You would only need to remove those bus bars to enable your speakers to be used with the K231. But many of our customers opt to physically remove the passive XO's entirely from their speaker cabinets to get the best possible sound quality. And still others opt to build their own speakers from the ground up! How far you want to go to get the best possible sound really just comes down to your level of DIY skills and your courage!To install the K231, simply unplug your preamp outputs from your amplifier and plug them into the K231 inputs instead. And plug additional cables from the K231 outputs to your amplifier's input jacks, one set for each of your speaker drivers. Risks & Challenges:We realize a lot of people are nervous about crowd funding. People have heard the horror stories of campaigns that have been funded, but then never followed through and delivered the rewards. Many campaigns want people to back them at pre-production stages. And sometimes even pre-design stages. These are definitely risky, with way too many variables. But we really believe our campaign is different. We have a mature design, with a hundreds of units in the field, and no unhappy customers that we’re aware of. And the reviews for our latest 3rd gen design are coming in very strong, almost universally enthusiastically positive. We believe our campaign is very low risk. The only risk is if the parts are not available due to back order or some other unforeseen delay. And we’ll move heaven and earth to find the shorted parts or address any delays to make sure that doesn’t happen! If you back our campaign, you can be assured we will do our level best to ship your K231 on schedule. 45 Day No-Hassle Return:And if for some reason you're not happy with your K231, you can return it for a full refund within 45 days, no questions asked. Help Us Bring the 3rd Gen K231 to the Next Level!We hope you'll support our campaign. We gotta reach our goal within the 30 day window, and it's all or nothing. Please help us spread the word ASAP by re-posting on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or the social media of your choice. And if you're active in an audiophile club or message board, we hope you'll put in a good word for us :) More Info:

<p>Hi, We're SEAVAL BeachStyle; a couple of watersports athletes originally from the Caribbean who decided it would be kinda chill to make and sport our own gear, so that's what we did and now we want to share it with you.</p>
<p>Our reward is being able to use our own goods and that is why we assure quality in everything we make otherwise it simply wouldn't be worth it. However in order to fund our projects we need the help of scale and that is how YOU can support us!</p>
<p>We don't need to make any profit, that's why our prices are so low. If we can distribute our goods, it'll make our custom production more feasible and it'll get our name out so we can do this more often. So, thanks for the speakers guys!</p>

<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>This is really as simple as it gets.<br/>We used recycled cardboard and dropped some quality speakers in them.  Just fold them up along the seems just like in the video, pop in the tabs, plug in any device with a 3.5mm jack (pretty much any mobile device) and hit play! You're ready to jam!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/618/011/6c392f28a29a6dc63762904971e179b7_large.png?1369429384"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h1>Origin</h1>
<p>We were looking to make small, light, eco-friendly, appealing and affordable speakers that actually worked, and so we began thinking. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We wanted to work with wood first but soon enough we figured the recycled and recyclable cardboard would be real sweet if we could pull it off and once we noticed it actually worked, it stuck! Next we had to figure out how to turn them into compact speakers that we could store in a tight spot for travelers, obviously folding would do the trick, but the puzzle was how to fold it most efficiently while maintaining sound quality. </p>
<p>Once we found a manufacturer with extensive experience in speakers systems that could bring this to life we were advised on what electronics etc. to use and soon enough we had the perfect combo. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/674/679/bfbeff430be53188938cfaad4169d0a0_large.jpg?1371244727"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now we had a cardboard speaker box that worked without batteries and connects to pretty much any modern mobile device, it was awesome! </p>
<p>So time to do some designing. We went through tons of designs for all sides and the protective case, we wanted something cool on each surface and ended up settling for this design to start off our production with. It's difficult to start up with multiple designs especially with the prices we are offering, but once this campaign is over, we'll be sure to throw out some new options and hopefully even customization! Help us make that possible!</p>

Hi, We're SEAVAL BeachStyle; a couple of watersports athletes originally from the Caribbean who decided it would be kinda chill to make and sport our own gear, so that's what we did and now we want to share it with you.
Our reward is being able to use our own goods and that is why we assure quality in everything we make otherwise it simply wouldn't be worth it. However in order to fund our projects we need the help of scale and that is how YOU can support us!
We don't need to make any profit, that's why our prices are so low. If we can distribute our goods, it'll make our custom production more feasible and it'll get our name out so we can do this more often. So, thanks for the speakers guys!

How it works
This is really as simple as it gets.We used recycled cardboard and dropped some quality speakers in them.  Just fold them up along the seems just like in the video, pop in the tabs, plug in any device with a 3.5mm jack (pretty much any mobile device) and hit play! You're ready to jam!

Check out any further info and specs on our website here: SeavalSoundWaves.com

 
Origin
We were looking to make small, light, eco-friendly, appealing and affordable speakers that actually worked, and so we began thinking. 
 


We wanted to work with wood first but soon enough we figured the recycled and recyclable cardboard would be real sweet if we could pull it off and once we noticed it actually worked, it stuck! Next we had to figure out how to turn them into compact speakers that we could store in a tight spot for travelers, obviously folding would do the trick, but the puzzle was how to fold it most efficiently while maintaining sound quality. 
Once we found a manufacturer with extensive experience in speakers systems that could bring this to life we were advised on what electronics etc. to use and soon enough we had the perfect combo. 


 
Now we had a cardboard speaker box that worked without batteries and connects to pretty much any modern mobile device, it was awesome! 
So time to do some designing. We went through tons of designs for all sides and the protective case, we wanted something cool on each surface and ended up settling for this design to start off our production with. It's difficult to start up with multiple designs especially with the prices we are offering, but once this campaign is over, we'll be sure to throw out some new options and hopefully even customization! Help us make that possible!

Rewards
10 Bucks a pop! As promised, for just 10 bucks we'll send you a set of SEAVAL SoundWaves, however if we don't reach our goal you will not be billed and no one will receive their SoundWaves, so if you want to take advantage of this amazing deal you're gonna have to make sure your friends get one as well... Like, Share and do all that other good stuff and we'll make sure to get you your set of speakers asap.Thanks, we couldn't do it without you!

But selling headphones makes no sense, as there are already many great brands selling audio products and our founder Bouwy is not Dr. Dre. We are licensing out the technology to these brands but apparently, no manager is interested in preventing jack failure problems for their customers. So we ran a crowdfunding campaign to pay for the first tooling and convince big brands to incorporate the JackSavior plug into their products.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578388923/salvtvqyfok8qf6w2vmj.png"" src=""""/></p><p><br/><strong>What happened after the first crowdfunding campaign?</strong></p><p>We shipped all the promised rewards/perks and our goal of convincing big brands succeeded as multiple brands want to have it.

 What We Have Done  Our MissionFull Body Sound started as a passion product for us. We love music and we love the combined experience of feeling our favorite songs while we listen to them. We also love extreme sports and (sometimes) this love resulted in minor injuries. With a TENS unit device in hand from physical therapy, and a desire for tactile audio-Full Body Sound was born. The more we shared it with friends and family the more we received the question, “Where can I get one of these?” We realized that it would be selfish to keep this experience to ourselves and are now happy to share it with you!Full Body Sound Features• Full stereo: Feel both left and right audio• Multi-user compatible: Share a musical and electrical connection with a friend• Compatible with TENS accessories: Turn your body into a custom speaker• More than bass: Stimulate your body to the full spectrum of music- vocals, string instruments, and electric guitars  To Use  1. Choose a song, the device is synced (through Bluetooth or auxiliary cord) to speakers or headphones. This way you can listen to the audio while you feel it!2. A pair of electrodes are placed on the skin of the user and electric current stimulates the muscles and nerves near the electrodes.3. Full Body Sound technology alters the audio input and conditions it, allowing users to feel audio frequencies.4. What you feel as a user varies from person to person. But, electrical stimulation contracts your muscles to the rhythm of the music wherever you choose. The user can choose to feel electric stimulation in a variety of places depending on the placement and location of electrodes. How it FeelsHave you ever played one of those old timey games at the carnival or arcade where you grabbed the metal knob and felt an exciting jolt with a friend? Or maybe you visited a museum where they had an exhibit describing electricity and how it travels from + to -. Full Body Sound electrically stimulates your muscles and nerves to the music with electrode pads on the surface of the skin.Want to feel something different? Just shift the electrode just by half an inch, or try a new location. Muscle groups also play a big role in what you will feel. For example, fast twitch muscle groups (like your bicep) can physically move your muscles. While slow-twitch groups ( like your lower back) will yield the rhythmic sensation of what you are listening to without much muscle movement. These are some of our favorite placements:
Testimonials Our first time users are energized by the initial sensation. We love seeing what different music genres people want to feel.

<h2>THE STORY</h2>
<p>Born in a small family-owned woodworking workshop in Burbank, California, Petite Square is the result of utilizing unique craftsmanship skills that were passed from our past generations. Our passion of working with rare and precious woods took another phase when we heard and felt the harmonical beauty of a violin made with 50,000 years old Ancient Kauri wood. The prominence of the sensation was so substantial that we promised ourselves to bring the natural harmonical and aesthetical beauty of the Ancient Kauri wood to music enthusiasts. To achieve our vision we asked the help of a two renowned local sound engineers to develop the <strong>world's first Ancient Kauri wooden Bluetooth speaker.</strong></p>
<p> <img alt=""Speaker"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s14.postimage.org/sl6irzla9/7_edited2.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Speaker""/></p>
<h2>THE WOOD</h2>
<p>Ancient Kauri is the <strong>oldest timber in the world</strong> that can be hand-crafted into wooden pieces of art. Native to New Zealand, Ancient Kauri has been preserved underground in a perfectly balanced bog environment. Coming from the Kauri forests that grew 45 to 50 millenniums ago, some of these Kauri trees grew for 600 to 2,000 years before falling from natural causes. Buried under a peat swamp by an unexplained act of nature, the trees have survived the centuries underground, sealed in a chemically balanced environment that has preserved the timber in perfect condition. Today, the Ancient Kauri logs are being extracted from the north island of New Zealand.</p>
<p>At <strong>50,000 years old</strong>, this relatively rare, expensive, and captivating wood, predates the migration of Neanderthals, the arrival of Homo Sapiens, and all the cave paintings in Europe. In another words, when you hold a Petite Square, you are<strong> holding a piece of organic history</strong>. </p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://www.ancientwood.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ancientwood.com</a></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>THE DESIGN</h2>
<p><strong>Contemporary</strong>, the element of being <strong>simple</strong> but <strong>beautiful</strong>. The element that our company is based on. The design was a very critical part of the process in bringing Petite Square to life. Complimenting Ancient Kauri's amazing history with today's design standards, we gave Petite Square straight rigid edges, making it into a <strong>perfect palm-fitting cube</strong>. Precision hand sanded straight and wide surfaces show the Ancient Kauri's beautiful grains, and brings the harmony between the modern minimalistic design and the history that each piece of Ancient Kauri tells.</p>
<p> <img alt=""Speaker"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s7.postimage.org/685v5ne3f/IMG_8214edited_3.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Speaker""/></p>
<h2>THE SOUND</h2>
<p>Just as Petite Square's design is quietly admirable, the delivery of flawless sound from the <strong>2"" full-range speaker</strong> is equally impressive. Exceptional harmonical properties of Ancient Kauri emanate a<strong> rich high-fidelity sound</strong> with<strong> crystal clear details</strong> and <strong>warm bass</strong> response. To achieve the petite palm-fitting size, we have designed a passive non-powered bass radiator that is driven by the force of the speaker and contributes in naturally amplifying the bass response. At <strong>5 watts</strong>, the advanced 2"" speakerdriver with <strong>Titanium cone</strong> and <strong>Neodymium rare earth magnet</strong>, the legendary <strong>CLASS T TRIPATH amplifier</strong>, and the carefully tuned proprietary <strong>passive bass radiator</strong> deliver a performance that we have only seen in considerably larger speakers.</p>
<p>Also, we saw sometimes there is a need to <strong>combine the souls of two Petite Squares</strong> into one <strong>stereo system</strong>. Because Bluetooth technology doeasn't allow linking two speakers wirelessly, we designed a linking system to link the two speakers in a stereo form by using the supplied 3.5mm linking cable and add even more depth to the already warm and organic sound.</p>
<p><img alt=""Speaker"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s9.postimage.org/li9682vzz/IMG_8039_edited_good_color.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Speaker""/></p>
<p><strong>STEREO </strong>LINK</p>
<p><img alt=""stereo system"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s2.postimage.org/rzord9dll/Stereo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>THE BLUETOOTH</h2>
<p>In order to harmonize the speaker's external and internal qualities, we have used <strong>CLASS 1 Bluetooth</strong> technology instead of the widely-used CLASS 2. The CLASS 1 Bluetooth has a <strong>range of 100 feet</strong> comparing to CLASS 2 which is only 30 feet. This not only means you get the <strong>freedom of moving around</strong>, accomplishing tasks without getting disconnected, but also means a much <strong>better sound quality</strong>. Bluetooth is designed to keep a balance between staying connected to the music source and quality of the sound. Better quality sound means greater data transfer which becomes tough when the distance between the speaker and the music source increases. Therefore, even tough the regular CLASS 2 technology has a maximum range of 30 feet, as the distance increases and gets closer to the maximum range, the sound quality decreases in order to keep the connection.</p>
<p>We solved this issue by using the advanced Bluetooth CLASS 1 technology which has the exceptional 100 feet range. This means a<strong> higher distance range of high-fidelity sound quality</strong> is achieved.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>THE BATTERY</h2>
<p>Being petite, small and truly portable didn't stop Petite Square from having a powerful 2500mah custom designed Lipo battery. This means having an astounding <strong>15+ hours of battery life</strong>. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>THE COLORS</h2>
<p>Different people, different personalities, but one love for music. That's a slogan that we want to reflect on by offering <strong>different color options</strong> while preserving the natural aesthetics of the Ancient Kauri wood.</p>
<p><img alt=""The Colors"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s8.postimage.org/xvrbxbbyt/COLOR_2.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Colors""/></p>
<h2>SUSTAINABILITY</h2>
<p>Since we use a wood which comes from the remaining of trees that are from 50,000 years ago, <strong>no live trees are harvested</strong>. Also, Ancient Kauri is RELATIVELY rare and that means, it might not be suitable for mass-producing violins, but interestingly about <strong>100 Petite Squares could be made from the same block of wood used to make a single violin</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt=""Speaker"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s14.postimage.org/atc7fr8xt/IMG_8270_edited_2.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Speaker""/></p>
<h2>OUR STATUS</h2>
<p>We brought this project from sketches drawn on napkins to a <strong>fully working piece</strong>. We have designed, engineered, and crafted petite square to the very last detail. In order to make this well thought product available to you at the price point we promised, we need to reach our <strong>fixed goal of $45000</strong> and meet the minimum needed order quantity. We have <strong>already partnered</strong> with the Ancient Kauri importer in Wisconsin, the Bluetooth modules and electronics supplier in Arizona, and the speaker drivers supplier in Ohio. Because each speaker is going to be <strong>hand-crafted and assembled here in Burbank, California</strong>, we have asked the help of a number local craftsmen and craftswomen in making these flawless pieces of art.</p>
<p><strong>We are asking your help in making our vision of seeing petite square in every music enthusiast's hand, a reality. Thank you!</strong></p>

Buried under a peat swamp by an unexplained act of nature, the trees have survived the centuries underground, sealed in a chemically balanced environment that has preserved the timber in perfect condition. Today, the Ancient Kauri logs are being extracted from the north island of New Zealand.
At 50,000 years old, this relatively rare, expensive, and captivating wood, predates the migration of Neanderthals, the arrival of Homo Sapiens, and all the cave paintings in Europe. In another words, when you hold a Petite Square, you are holding a piece of organic history.

THE DESIGN
Contemporary, the element of being simple but beautiful. The element that our company is based on. The design was a very critical part of the process in bringing Petite Square to life. Complimenting Ancient Kauri's amazing history with today's design standards, we gave Petite Square straight rigid edges, making it into a perfect palm-fitting cube. Precision hand sanded straight and wide surfaces show the Ancient Kauri's beautiful grains, and brings the harmony between the modern minimalistic design and the history that each piece of Ancient Kauri tells.
 
THE SOUND
Just as Petite Square's design is quietly admirable, the delivery of flawless sound from the 2"" full-range speaker is equally impressive. Exceptional harmonical properties of Ancient Kauri emanate a rich high-fidelity sound with crystal clear details and warm bass response. To achieve the petite palm-fitting size, we have designed a passive non-powered bass radiator that is driven by the force of the speaker and contributes in naturally amplifying the bass response. At 5 watts, the advanced 2"" speakerdriver with Titanium cone and Neodymium rare earth magnet, the legendary CLASS T TRIPATH amplifier, and the carefully tuned proprietary passive bass radiator deliver a performance that we have only seen in considerably larger speakers.
Also, we saw sometimes there is a need to combine the souls of two Petite Squares into one stereo system. Because Bluetooth technology doeasn't allow linking two speakers wirelessly, we designed a linking system to link the two speakers in a stereo form by using the supplied 3.5mm linking cable and add even more depth to the already warm and organic sound.

STEREO LINK

THE BLUETOOTH
In order to harmonize the speaker's external and internal qualities, we have used CLASS 1 Bluetooth technology instead of the widely-used CLASS 2. The CLASS 1 Bluetooth has a range of 100 feet comparing to CLASS 2 which is only 30 feet. This not only means you get the freedom of moving around, accomplishing tasks without getting disconnected, but also means a much better sound quality. Bluetooth is designed to keep a balance between staying connected to the music source and quality of the sound. Better quality sound means greater data transfer which becomes tough when the distance between the speaker and the music source increases. Therefore, even tough the regular CLASS 2 technology has a maximum range of 30 feet, as the distance increases and gets closer to the maximum range, the sound quality decreases in order to keep the connection.
We solved this issue by using the advanced Bluetooth CLASS 1 technology which has the exceptional 100 feet range. This means a higher distance range of high-fidelity sound quality is achieved.
 
THE BATTERY
Being petite, small and truly portable didn't stop Petite Square from having a powerful 2500mah custom designed Lipo battery. This means having an astounding 15+ hours of battery life. 
 
THE COLORS
Different people, different personalities, but one love for music. That's a slogan that we want to reflect on by offering different color options while preserving the natural aesthetics of the Ancient Kauri wood.

SUSTAINABILITY
Since we use a wood which comes from the remaining of trees that are from 50,000 years ago, no live trees are harvested. Also, Ancient Kauri is RELATIVELY rare and that means, it might not be suitable for mass-producing violins, but interestingly about 100 Petite Squares could be made from the same block of wood used to make a single violin.

OUR STATUS
We brought this project from sketches drawn on napkins to a fully working piece. We have designed, engineered, and crafted petite square to the very last detail. In order to make this well thought product available to you at the price point we promised, we need to reach our fixed goal of $45000 and meet the minimum needed order quantity. We have already partnered with the Ancient Kauri importer in Wisconsin, the Bluetooth modules and electronics supplier in Arizona, and the speaker drivers supplier in Ohio. Because each speaker is going to be hand-crafted and assembled here in Burbank, California, we have asked the help of a number local craftsmen and craftswomen in making these flawless pieces of art.
We are asking your help in making our vision of seeing petite square in every music enthusiast's hand, a reality. Thank you!

<td style=""width:205px;""><p><strong> Why should we use it?</strong></p></td>
<td style=""width:432px;"">
<p>Due to the force needed to insert and remove the audio connector, device audio socket cloud break over time. So if you need to often switch between multiple devices, JackSafe will help. JackSafe is also useful in these kinds of situations: someone knocked on the door and you go to open the door, someone called you and you go to respond, you feel thirsty and you go to drink some water, but each time you forgot that you have headsets in your ears, then JackSafe is definitely for you.</p>

What is it? 
JackSafe is Magnetic 3,5mm audio jack adapter. This adapter helps to prolong the life of original audio jack and audio port of your device. It will save your device or headphone if something accidentally pulls the wire.


 Who created it?
We're a team of 4 who came from a variety of backgrounds including engineering, design and commercial manufacturing. We are living in Shenzhen and professionally involved in producing OEM audio products.


 Why should we use it?

Due to the force needed to insert and remove the audio connector, device audio socket cloud break over time. So if you need to often switch between multiple devices, JackSafe will help. JackSafe is also useful in these kinds of situations: someone knocked on the door and you go to open the door, someone called you and you go to respond, you feel thirsty and you go to drink some water, but each time you forgot that you have headsets in your ears, then JackSafe is definitely for you.
 We aimed higher to ensure JackSafe is a perfect balance of form, function, and style.



 What is the price?
Our Super early bird backers can get JackSafe at as low as $19 - up to 29% off the retail price of $27.


 Where can we buy it?
Right here on Indiegogo! Pre-order yours today to be one of the first people to get the JackSafe connector.


 What do we get when we order?
Depending on chosen pack beginning from 1 set (1 phone end and 1 cable end)


 Why are you crowdfunding?
We love crowdfunding! For us, it's a perfect solution to ensure we meet minimum order quantities for the first production batch - our tooling is done and we're ready to scale up our manufacturing.

 Product features

Which phones does it work with?
We tested with iPhone, Nokia, HTC, Blackberry, Samsung, Xiaomi, Meizu phones, of course, we cannot test it with all phones on the market, but we can assure you it will work with 97% of devices that has a universal headphone jack connector.


What colors do you offer?
Due to high demands of minimum order quantity for the first batch, we decided to choose only the black color.


Will it support headset detection on the phone?
Unfortunately, it cannot detect the earphones or headsets connection. When the JackSafe's phone part is inserted into the phone (or other audio devices), the phone will always think that the headset is connected, it will keep playing music even if the second part of JackSafe is disconnected. So it will require stopping music manually. 


What is the size of the JackSafe
The size can be checked in the JackSafe drawing on the campaign page.


Will it work with my phone case?
We tested our prototype with many cases and found that it fit almost all cases if the thickness at the place of connection of the case does not exceed 1,5mm.


What are additional features available?
JackSafe will align itself, just put two parts of it close to each other and it will connect itself in the right way.


I used to catch my falling phone by pulling the earphones wire. Will JackSafe save my device in a similar situation?
No, JackSafe is designed to prevent the cable from breaking or your devices like laptops from being cracked to the floor due to accidental pulling. We do not recommend to rely on the earphones wire when the phone is falling. First of all earphones cable can be destroyed, second device audio port also can be broken. Please use rugged phone cases to protect your phones, some of them can be really slim and good looking meanwhile they can stand drops from 30ft.


How will it help to prolong the life of my device audio port?
 Every connector has a limited lifetime, which is measured in plug/unplug cycles. Especially when an accidental pulling force applied to the audio jack it can be damaged. Thanks to magnetic connection JackSafe will simply disconnect saving your audio jack from wearing out.


Is it can be used as a waterproof plug for audio jack?
Jack safe can be used as a dustproof plug, but it's not waterproof.


Where is it manufactured?
In Shenzhen, China ?our team is located in China permanently to oversee the full production process.

 Shipping

When does shipping begin?
Shipping for all sets will be in April 2018.


When can we expect it to reach our doorsteps?
All orders are expected to be delivered to your doorsteps for the end of April 2018.


Where does it ship? 
We're proud to ship our JackSafe magnetic adapters worldwide. Shipping rates vary depending on your country.


How much is shipping?
Please see reward details for all locations. Local taxes not included.


I'm interested in a distribution partnership.

Do I have to pay VAT / GST? 
Yes, depending on your location, you may have to pay VAT/GST, but in some countries, you don't have to pay a tax because JackSafe is small, not expensive item.

 Customer Service

Is there a warranty?

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Lumies are intelligent light modules that wirelessly communicate with StickEar. They can be configured to glow and light up in different colours to convey notifications from StickEar sensors. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Subscribing to notifications from a StickEar sensor is simple. A user simply brings StickEar close to a Lumie Light and press the pair button on StickEar. The Lumie light will flash to indicate a successful pairing. Multiple Lumies can be paired with StickEar. Also, Lumies  relay information between each other, extending its wireless range to reach difficult corners in the house or building.</p>

<p><span>Lumies come in two form factors -  A standard E27 Edison Bulb or as a battery powered light block. The Lumie bulb is exceptionally bright as a visual notification, and can be a permanent fixture in a room. Lumie blocks are smaller portable lights which are less intrusive, and easy to carry around. They are useful if you want an ambient personal notification without intruding others. Bring along a Lumie block and StickEar while you are travelling for work or holidays.</span></p>

The design has been repeatedly prototyped and iterated upon with rigorous testing and feedback from beta testers. Our software and electronics design is almost final and we are putting the finishing touches to the industrial design. The images you see are actual devices and not renderings. That is how close we are to delivering you a great product. We believe that our timeline is realistic.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>What is the listening range of StickEar?</b></span></p>
<p>The listening range of StickEar depends on the loudness of the sound. As a reference, it can detect the sound of a baby crying within a 5 meter range.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>What is the battery life of StickEar?</b></span></p>
<p>We have optimised the power consumption of StickEar and it can last for up to 3 months on a single battery charge.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Does StickEar require a Wifi connection?</b></p>
<p>StickEar and Lumies uses the Zigbee wireless communication protocol which operates at 2.4 GHz. You don't need to have Wifi in order to use StickEar and Lumies.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>How many types of sounds can StickEar hear?</b></span></p>
<p>Currently, StickEar can hear and recognise the following sounds reliably:</p>
<ul><li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Door Knock</span></li></ul>
<ul><li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Baby Cries</span></li></ul>
<ul><li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Door Bells</span></li></ul>
<ul><li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Fire Alarms</span></li></ul>

</div></div>","We believe smart devices should be more inclusive, and assistive devices deserve more design and innovation. The low demand for assistive devices have led to high cost and little innovation. While mobile phones have gotten smarter with each passing day, assistive devices like the door bell for the deaf has pretty much remained the same all these years. We are here to change this. We designed StickEar, a smart sound alert system. This is not simply for those with hearing loss, but for anyone else who has a need - the elderly, people who live or work in noisy environments, or families who want to monitor specific areas in their homes.
StickEar translates sound events into visual alerts. It is beautifully designed and packed with additional features that would better allow any person to be more aware of important sound events. StickEar has inbuilt sensors that can detect door knocks/movement, doorbells, smoke/fire alarms and baby cries. It then alerts the user through multiple wireless light modules - Lumies. 










Stay Alert.
Want to know if someone is entering or leaving the house? StickEar can alert you when it detects door movement. StickEar is equipped with a reliable knock detection algorithm. Now you don't have to be worried about not receiving an important visitor or delivery any more.Regular doorbells can come in a variety of different sounds. You can also train your StickEar to recognise the sound of your doorbell. Family members can hear the doorbell, while the deaf and elderly can be visually alerted at the same time by Lumies. You can also place it on windows.





Feel safe and assured. 
StickEar can be trained to recognise the sound of the fire/smoke alarm at home. In the event of an emergency, StickEar will be able to detect the alarm sound and activate all the Lumies at home with bright flashes.Alternatively, you can set your StickEar into general alarm monitoring mode, in which it will be triggered when it hears a loud persistent sound. This could be an indication of something important that needs further investigation and attention.





Give your immediate attention to your loved ones
We know how difficult it is to take care of a baby, and how important it is to give all the love and attention you child needs. StickEar can detect the cries of your baby and Lumies can alert you while you are in another location in the house. 














Lumies are intelligent light modules that wirelessly communicate with StickEar. They can be configured to glow and light up in different colours to convey notifications from StickEar sensors. 
Subscribing to notifications from a StickEar sensor is simple. A user simply brings StickEar close to a Lumie Light and press the pair button on StickEar. The Lumie light will flash to indicate a successful pairing. Multiple Lumies can be paired with StickEar. Also, Lumies  relay information between each other, extending its wireless range to reach difficult corners in the house or building.

Lumies come in two form factors -  A standard E27 Edison Bulb or as a battery powered light block. The Lumie bulb is exceptionally bright as a visual notification, and can be a permanent fixture in a room. Lumie blocks are smaller portable lights which are less intrusive, and easy to carry around. They are useful if you want an ambient personal notification without intruding others. Bring along a Lumie block and StickEar while you are travelling for work or holidays.









Here are some of the many comments that we have received during beta testing:""My current doorbell system works with only 1 light. With StickEar and multiple Lumies I can be notified anywhere in the house.""""I can bring StickEar and a Lumie block when I go on a holiday and use it in the hotel room. I don't have to worry about staying alone in the room, and not be able to hear someone at the door or if a fire alarm goes off.""""I stay in a two storey house. Sometimes I can't hear my baby upstairs while I am in the kitchen on the ground floor. I can definitely use a Lumie in the kitchen.""""My grandmother has poor hearing. Sometimes when I visit her, she can't hear me while I knock on the door. The Lumie bulb is very bright. Putting one in the living room will be great since she can notice the flashing light easily.""""I play computer games in my room with the headphones on. I can use StickEar to know when my parents are back home, so I can quickly go back to my assignments."" Here is a list of deaf organisations whom  we have partnered with, and will be receiving the StickEars generously donated by you.
Dr. Reijntjes School for the Deaf, Sri Lanka (http://www.schoolforthedeaf.lk)


The Singapore Association for the Deaf (http://sadeaf.org.sg)
Deaf Sports Association Singapore (http://www.dsa.org.sg)
ExtraOrdinary Horizons (http://www.eohorizons.com)

We will be updating this campaign page and also our webpage with photos and letters from the various deaf associations upon receiving your kind donations of StickEar. Each StickEar will come with a thank you card which will be filled up by a recipient and sent back to supporters who opt to donate a set of StickEars. For those who contribute to the StickEar Money Jar reward, your name will be listed in our website's hall of fame.
If you belong to a deaf organisation and would like to be a partner with us to receive StickEar from our Indiegogo supporters, please send us an email at: founders@stickear.com
















We're a team of  engineers, computer scientists and academics based in Singapore. StickEar is a collaboration between the Augmented Human Lab at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, and Embodied Sensing, a Singapore startup company.









There are inherent challenges in building hardware but we got it all worked out from design, software, electronics, suppliers, financing, all the way to distribution.
We are not starting from scratch. Our team has extensive experience in acoustics signal processing and electronics design. The design has been repeatedly prototyped and iterated upon with rigorous testing and feedback from beta testers. Our software and electronics design is almost final and we are putting the finishing touches to the industrial design. The images you see are actual devices and not renderings. That is how close we are to delivering you a great product. We believe that our timeline is realistic. We will be working with an experienced contract manufacturer who has already helped many other projects to deliver.



What is the listening range of StickEar?
The listening range of StickEar depends on the loudness of the sound. As a reference, it can detect the sound of a baby crying within a 5 meter range.
What is the battery life of StickEar?
We have optimised the power consumption of StickEar and it can last for up to 3 months on a single battery charge.

Does StickEar require a Wifi connection?
StickEar and Lumies uses the Zigbee wireless communication protocol which operates at 2.4 GHz. You don't need to have Wifi in order to use StickEar and Lumies.
How many types of sounds can StickEar hear?
Currently, StickEar can hear and recognise the following sounds reliably:
Door Knock
Baby Cries
Door Bells
Fire Alarms
Can StickEar hear other sounds?
There is an option to set StickEar to operate in a general sound monitoring mode in which it can be triggered by any loud sound. There is also a general alarm monitoring mode in which only a loud continuous sound can trigger it.
How do I train StickEar to recognise the sound of my door bell and fire/smoke alarm?It is easy to train your StickEar. Just set your StickEar into training mode, play the same sound to it 2 to 3 times. If the sound matches, it will be successfully trained. StickEar will now be able to recognise this new sound and send notifications to Lumies.Can I have multiple StickEars notifying Lumies?Yes, you can use multiple StickEars with multiple Lumies.I live in two storey house. Can a StickEar on the ground floor notify a Lumie on the second floor?StickEar and Lumies have a wireless range of up to 50m. The range will be reduced if there are solid walls in between a StickEar and Lumie. However, Lumies can forward notifications between each other. So if you have problems with a Lumie that is out of range from a StickEar, you can place another Lumie in between them. How do I personalise the colour of my Lumie?You can personalise the colour of a Lumie and assign a different colour for each type of notification. This can be done directly using the controls on StickEar.I would like to give my StickEar to a deaf organisation of my choice/ I know a deaf organisation that would like to receive StickEar.Please send us an email at: founders@stickear.com. We will be more than happy to send StickEars to the organisation of your choice.How do I know if the deaf organisation received the StickEar I donated?We will ask our partner deaf organisations to provide a notice of acceptance upon receiving StickEars. These notices will be put up on this campaign page and also on our website.",32.0,0,"1 Campaign

""The amplifier of the Mystic Box has been developed considering the best design rules for optimum EMC to improve its performance against electromagnetic interference. At the same time, this type of design offers a very good SNR. All this confirms the excellence of the Klanger team."" - <b>Francesc Daura</b>, CEO at CEMDAL.</span>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><br/></span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">""My relationship with music is since I was very young, when my father gave me my first Spanish guitar. I studied music and became so fond of it that I have to admit that, for me, it's a daily necessity. I have had several stereos, but my surprise was to get to know Klanger. In addition to an absolute formal simplicity, what has really excited me is the quality and freshness of how my favorite musicians sound. The timbre of the guitar, at a generous volume, is realistic and at the same time it doesn't show the pomposity that many stereos add, but the guitar definitely doesn't have."" - <b>Fernando Navarro</b>, musician.</span></div><div>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/873667/files/20140922044006-0.10_Exhibition_Kasimir_Malevich.png?1411386006"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div>
<p>Elegance and simplicity. For the design of the Mystic Box, our inspiration came from the work of Kasimir Malevich, an artist who founded the Suprematism, a movement which focuses on basic geometric shapes.</p>
<p>For us, each piece is so special that it is built, painted and polished by hand to give that unique human touch which transforms it into a work of art - a music system you enjoy even when switched off.</p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p>It's all about art, science and passion. Creating beautiful shapes and solid structures to achieve the best sound quality is far from being an easy task.</p>
<p>As an example, fast and high pressure air changes in speaker enclosures can cause vibration patterns which add coloration to the music.</p>
<p>A carefully designed enclosure and the adequate combination of structural materials give the cabinets of the Mystic Box strength and stability, not allowing for any coloration.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Ease of use: One of the concepts which came to our minds when designing the Mystic Box. We create music systems, hence we design them for listening to music, not for wasting your valuable time with complicated configurations or settings.</p>
<p>The Mystic Box has an easy-to-use, neat interface. Just a volume control and a power switch. There’s no need for anything else.</p>
<p>Now, where's the volume control? It's in the cross, the mystic cross. Just touch its upper or lower part to change it.</p>
<p>And the wireless setup? Same concept: Ease of use. Pair it just once with your device and it's done forever.</p>

</div><div>
<p>The speakers of the Mystic Box having small cabinets need special dedication to produce a big sound. Audiophile quality digital signal processing (DSP) and digital to analog conversion (DAC) at 192kHz/24 bit is applied to fine tune the system. There’s no better way to feel all the emotion of your favourite music.<br/></p>
<p>It also continuously analyzes the output for delivering powerful yet controlled sound, no matter how loud, by controlling the driver's excursion at high volume levels and instantly reducing it to protect the speakers against damage and avoid those annoying distortions. Yes, your party will last all night!</p>
<br/>
</div><h3>Incredible efficiency</h3><div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1028549/files/20141119042048-Incredible_Efficiency.png?1416399648"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<p>Electronic devices have losses, and these losses are wasted energy, mostly in form of heat. To reduce them, we have designed the Mystic Box to be highly energy efficient. Combining our switching technology with carefully designed printed circuit boards and high quality components, its efficiency reaches levels above 90%.</p>
<p>This means that it does not need big heat sinks, heavy transformers or voluminous enclosures, resulting in a smaller, lighter and more reliable device.</p>
<p>A smaller size also requires less materials in the manufacturing processes, involving lower costs and lower greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<br/><h3>Less is more</h3>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1004291/files/20141111031424-3D_Less_Is_More.png?1415704464"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div>
<p>To minimise the carbon footprint of our business we have striven to reduce the amount of materials needed for the Mystic Box and combine this with efficient manufacturing techniques in order to make the most out of every cubic centimetre / inch of material, as well as using the least possible amount of energy during the process.</p>
<p>We have incorporated 3D printing in the industrial processes. Additive manufacturing allows us to make zero-waste parts, as the printers only add the material needed, i.e. not removing excess from a block of material as classic industrial processes do.</p>
<p>But this not being enough for us, we have aimed to manufacture the Mystic Box with more than 60% of recycled raw materials, the remaining 40% coming from certified and responsible sources.</p>
<br/>
</div><h3>Responsibility</h3><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/963000/files/20141027094739-RESPONSIBILITY.png?1414428459"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>In order to maintain our high standards in product quality, health &amp; safety and our commitment to the environment, our suppliers must live up to the toughest standards in the industry.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that before we choose a supplier, we evaluate their facilities so as to comply with our quality, safety and environment directives.</p>
<p>All of our suppliers fulfil quality standards ISO 9001:2008, UL 94V-0 and environmental ISO 14001:2004.</p>
<p>We want to offer you a high quality, responsibly manufactured and environmentally friendly product, and we think that this is the only way this can be achieved.</p>

</div><div>
<p>
We believe in the local industry infrastructure, so the Mystic Box is completely manufactured and assembled at less than 50 km / 30 miles from our headquarters.</p>
<p>We also think that the real value of a product lies in the passion and dedication of every person taking part in the project during the design and manufacturing processes. There's passionate artisanal work in the creation of every Mystic Box that makes each piece unique. And we are proud of it.</p>

<p>We have designed the back panel to be neat and easy. The Mystic Box comes with one stereo, gold-plated RCA input for connection of almost every device, a power plug, an on/off switch and two speaker outputs. All fitted in a beautiful, single black anodized aluminum panel.</p>
<br/><h3>Where we are</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1004264/files/20141111030616-Working.png?1415703976"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Mystic Box is the result of nearly three years of development of a single idea: to make a beautiful, efficient and incredibly good sounding music system. A project that started from a single PCB design of a small power amplifier and which has evolved into a full compact Hi-Fi system. A tech-marvel inside a work of art.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/947969/files/20141021075240-1st_Working_Proto.png?1413903160"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It has been an exciting journey to arrive where we are now: The electronics have been completely re-designed with new features such as Bluetooth and dedicated amps for each speaker, upgraded premium and more efficient components, a better PCB design for an even higher SNR and the addition of a DSP core that keeps everything under control.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p>Now, the Mystic Box is close to reality. We also have re-designed the drive unit accomodation pieces of the cabinets to achieve a new stage of sound quality and developed a bigger amp enclosure to accomodate all the new electronics and touch sensitive volume control. These modifications also involve lower production costs and a more exact reproduction of Malevich's paintings.</p>
<p>After hours of simulation, we have finally created a new prototype, modifying parts of the old version and 3D printing the new ones.<br/></p>

<h3>A bit of history</h3>

<div>
<p>For developing the Mystic Box we have created Klanger, an audio startup company based in Barcelona. The company has been founded by Martí Castany and Andreas Manz, two music and technology enthusiasts who met by chance in 2013.</p>
<p>The initial idea starts when, in 2011, 19-year-old Martí begins toying with the idea of offering the world a combination of what he loves: music, art and technology. At this time it is only a dream, an idea which needs maturing.</p>
<p>Active critic of music system wherever he goes, from parties to clothing stores and bars, Martí finally decides that the best way to join all his requirements in sound systems would be to create them by himself.</p>
<p>His first speakers see the light in 2011. Modern looking and with a great performance, they are designed for Hi-Fi systems to be used in large spaces. Proud of the results and tired of the poor sound quality of mobile phones, portable music players, tablets, computers and the external devices that are used to play them, Martí proposes to design a complete compact system, with a sound quality not achieved so far, combined with maximum energy efficiency, a commitment to the environment and ease of use.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, Xavier Vidal introduces him to the Black Square and the rest of the work of Kazimir Malevich, which immediately becomes Martí’s inspiration for the aesthetic design of the system.
</p>
<p>Andreas, german self-employed engineer with 35 years of experience in design, installation and repair of high quality Hi-Fi systems and specialized in analog hardware, has the dream of working with young people in a project related with energy efficiency and sound quality, bored by the amounts of wasted energy in classic systems and in this way transfer his knowledge and experience to the next generation.
</p>
<p>When in mid-2013 Martí meets Andreas through a common acquaintance and invites him to his garage, where he has some sketches and prototype PCBs for a small music system, the latter shows immediate interest in the project and, in a few minutes, edits elements which would bring one of the key aspects to the Mystic Box: Its sound quality.
</p>
<p>It is at that moment when both realize that combining the strength of youth with the wisdom and experience of maturity, they would be able to create something completely new and revolutionary, something incredible.
</p>
<p>That is the moment when Klanger is born.</p>

<p>""El amplificador de la
Mystic Box ha sido desarrollado teniendo en cuenta las mejores reglas de diseño
para una óptima EMC y así mejorar su respuesta frente a las interferencias
electromagnéticas. Al mismo tiempo, este tipo de diseño ofrece una muy buena relación
señal/ruido. Todo esto confirma la excelencia del equipo Klanger.""-
<b>Francesc Daura</b>, CEO en CEMDAL.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>""Mi relación con la música es desde muy pequeño, cuando mi padre me regaló mi<br/>primera guitarra española. Estudié música y me aficioné de tal forma que tengo que admitir que, para mí, es una necesidad diaria. He tenido diversos equipos de sonido, pero mi sorpresa fue conocer Klanger. A una simplicidad formal absoluta se le añade lo que realmente me entusiasmó: la calidad y frescura con que suenan mis músicos favoritos. El timbre de la guitarra, con un volumen generoso, es realista y a la vez sin esa pomposidad que muchos aparatos le añaden y que la guitarra, definitivamente, no tiene."" <b>Fernando Navarro</b>, músico. <br/></p>

<h3>Arte</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/873667/files/20140922044006-0.10_Exhibition_Kasimir_Malevich.png?1411386006"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>Elegancia y sencillez.
Para el diseño de la Mystic Box , nuestra inspiración vino de la obra de
Kasimir Malevich, artista que fundó el suprematismo, un movimiento que se
centra en formas geométricas básicas.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Para nosotros cada pieza
es tan especial que se construye, pinta y pule a mano para darle ese único
toque humano que la transforma en una obra de arte - un sistema de música que
se disfruta incluso cuando está apagado.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Ciencia</h3>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1004502/files/20141111050700-Natura_Mystic_Def.png?1415711220"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Se trata de arte, ciencia
y pasión. Crear formas bellas y estructuras sólidas para lograr la mejor
calidad de sonido está lejos de ser tarea fácil.</p>
<p>A modo de ejemplo, los
cambios de aire rápidos y de alta presión presentes en recintos de altavoces
pueden causar patrones de vibración que añaden coloración a la música.</p>
<p>Un recinto cuidadosamente
diseñado y la combinación adecuada de materiales estructurales dan a los recintos
de la Mystic Box una fuerza y estabilidad que no permiten ningún tipo de
coloración.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Diseñada para las personas</h3>
</div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1011098/files/20141113043945-Mystic_Peto.png?1415882385"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Facilidad de uso: uno de
los conceptos que vino a nuestra mente al diseñar la Mystic Box. Creamos
equipos de música. Por lo tanto, los diseñamos para escuchar música, no para que
pierdas tu valioso tiempo con configuraciones o ajustes complicados.</p>
<p>La Mystic Box tiene una
interfaz nítida y fácil de usar. Solo un control de volumen y un interruptor de
encendido. No hay necesidad de nada más.</p>
<p>Ahora, ¿dónde está el
control de volumen? Está en la cruz, la cruz mística. Solo tienes que tocar su
parte superior o inferior para cambiarlo.</p>
<p>Y la configuración
inalámbrica? El mismo concepto: facilidad de uso. Emparéjala solamente una vez
con tu dispositivo y estará hecho para siempre.</p>

<p>Además, como la Mystic Box
es tan compacta, podrás colocarla en cualquier lugar.</p>

<h3>Procesamiento de audiófilo</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1020082/files/20141116130840-Processing.png?1416172120"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Las cajas acústicas de la
Mystic Box, al ser de tamaño reducido, necesitan una dedicación especial para
producir un gran sonido. Se aplica un procesamiento de señal digital (DSP) y una
conversión digital/analógica (DAC) de calidad audiófila a 192kHz/24 bits para
afinar el sistema. No existe mejor manera de sentir toda la emoción de tu
música favorita.</p>
<p>También analiza
continuamente la salida de audio para entregar un sonido potente pero
controlado, sin importar a qué volumen, controlando la excursión del altavoz a
niveles altos de escucha y reduciéndola al instante para proteger los altavoces
contra daños y evitar esas molestas distorsiones. Sí, ¡su fiesta durará toda la
noche!</p>
<br/><p></p>
<h3>Eficiencia increíble</h3>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1037819/files/20141122080010-Eficiencia.png?1416672010"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Los aparatos electrónicos
tienen pérdidas, y estas pérdidas son energía desperdiciada, sobre todo en
forma de calor. Para reducirlas, hemos diseñado la Mystic Box para ser
altamente eficiente. Combinando nuestra tecnología de conmutación con circuitos
impresos cuidadosamente diseñados y componentes de alta calidad, su eficiencia
alcanza niveles superiores al 90%.</p>
<p>Esto significa que no
necesita grandes disipadores de calor, transformadores pesados o recintos voluminosos,
resultando en un dispositivo más pequeño, más ligero y más fiable.</p>
<p>Un tamaño más pequeño
también requiere menos materiales en los procesos de fabricación, lo que
implica menores costes y menos emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero.</p>
<p></p>
<br/><h3>Menos es más</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1004291/files/20141111031424-3D_Less_Is_More.png?1415704464"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Para reducir al mínimo nuestra
huella de carbono nos hemos esforzado por reducir la cantidad de materiales
necesarios para la fabricación de la Mystic Box y lo hemos combinado con
técnicas de fabricación eficientes con el fin de sacar el máximo provecho de
cada centímetro cúbico de material, así como usar la menor cantidad posible de
energía durante el proceso.</p>
<p>También hemos incorporado
impresión 3D en los procesos industriales. La fabricación aditiva nos permite
hacer piezas con cero desechos, dado que las impresoras solo añaden el material
necesario, es decir, no eliminan el exceso de un bloque de material como lo
hacen los procesos industriales clásicos.</p>
<p>Pero al no ser esto
suficiente para nosotros, nos hemos puesto el objetivo de fabricar la Mystic Box
con más del 60% de materias primas recicladas, y el 40% restante proveniente de
fuentes certificadas y responsables.</p>
<br/><p></p>
<h3>Responsabilidad</h3>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/963000/files/20141027094739-RESPONSIBILITY.png?1414428459"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Con el fin de mantener
nuestros altos estándares en la calidad de producto, salud y seguridad y nuestro
compromiso con el medio ambiente, nuestros proveedores deben cumplir con los más
exigentes estándares de la industria.</p>
<p>Es por esta razón por la
que antes de que elijamos a un proveedor, evaluamos si sus instalaciones cumplen
con nuestras directrices de calidad, seguridad y medio ambiente.</p>
<p>Todos nuestros proveedores
cumplen los estándares de calidad ISO 9001: 2008, UL 94V-0 y medioambiental ISO
14001: 2004.</p>
<p>Queremos ofrecerte un
producto de alta calidad, fabricado de forma responsable y respetuoso con el
medio ambiente, y creemos que esta es la única forma de lograrlo.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Potenciando al pequeño</h3>

<p></p>
<p>Creemos en la infraestructura
industria local, por lo que la Mystic Box está fabricada y montada por completo
a menos de 50 km de nuestra sede.</p>
<p>También creemos que el
valor real de un producto radica en la pasión y dedicación de todas las
personas que participan en el proyecto durante los procesos de diseño y
fabricación. Hay un apasionado trabajo artesanal en la creación de cada Mystic Box
que hace que cada pieza sea única. Y estamos muy orgullosos de ello.</p>

<p>La Mystic Box es el
resultado de casi tres años de desarrollo de una idea: hacer un sistema de
música bello, eficiente y que suene increíblemente bien. Un proyecto que se
inició a partir de un diseño de un pequeño amplificador de potencia y que ha
evolucionado hasta convertirse en un sistema compacto de alta fidelidad completo.
Una maravilla tecnológica dentro de una obra de arte.</p>

<p>Ahora, la Mystic Box está
cerca de ser una realidad. También hemos rediseñado el alojamiento de los
altavoces en los recintos para alcanzar un nuevo nivel en la calidad del sonido
y hemos desarrollado un recinto amplificador más grande para dar cabida a toda
la nueva electrónica y al control de volumen táctil. Estas modificaciones
también implican menores costos de producción y una reproducción más exacta de
las pinturas de Malevich.</p>
<p>Después de horas de
simulación, hemos creado un nuevo prototipo modificando partes de la versión
antigua e imprimiendo de nuevas con impresión 3D.</p>

<p>Queremos cambiar la
electrónica de consumo a productos de alta eficiencia energética, reciclables y
fabricados de manera responsable, diseñados con la única premisa de hacer que
la gente disfrute de ellos durante años sin obsolescencia programada.</p>

<h3>Un poco de historia</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1004276/files/20141111030942-Inicial.png?1415704182"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Para el desarrollo de la Mystic
Box hemos creado Klanger, una startup con sede en Barcelona. La compañía ha
sido fundada por Martí Castany y Andreas Manz, dos entusiastas de la música y
la tecnología que se conocieron por casualidad en 2013.</p>
<p>La idea inicial comienza cuando,
en 2011, con 19 años, Martí comienza a jugar con la idea de ofrecer al mundo
una combinación de lo que más le gusta: la música, el arte y la tecnología. En
ese momento es solo un sueño, una idea que necesita madurar.</p>
<p>Crítico activo de sistemas
de música donde quiera que vaya, desde fiestas hasta tiendas de ropa o bares,
Martí finalmente decide que la mejor manera de unir todos sus requerimientos en
sistemas de sonido sería que las creara él mismo.</p>
<p>Sus primeras cajas
acústicas ven la luz en el año 2011. De aspecto moderno y con un gran rendimiento,
están diseñados para sistemas de alta fidelidad que se usen en grandes
espacios. Orgulloso de los resultados y cansado de la mala calidad de sonido de
los teléfonos móviles, reproductores de música portátiles, tabletas,
ordenadores y los dispositivos externos que se utilizan para conectarlos, Martí
se propone el diseño de un sistema compacto completo con una calidad de sonido
no lograda hasta ahora, combinado con una máxima eficiencia energética,
compromiso con el medio ambiente y facilidad de uso.</p>
<p>Mientras tanto, Xavier
Vidal le introduce al Cuadrado Negro y al resto de la obra de Kazimir Malevich,
que se convierte de inmediato en la inspiración de Martí para el diseño
estético del sistema.</p>
<p>Andreas, ingeniero alemán autoempleado
con 35 años de experiencia en diseño, instalación y reparación de sistemas
Hi-Fi de alta calidad y especializado en hardware analógico, tiene el sueño de
trabajar con jóvenes en un proyecto relacionado con la eficiencia energética y
la calidad de sonido, aburrido de las cantidades de energía que se desperdician
en los sistemas clásicos, y de este modo transferir su conocimiento y
experiencia a las siguientes generaciones.</p>
<p>Cuando a mediados de 2013
Martí se encuentra con Andreas a través de un amigo común y lo invita a su
garaje donde tiene algunos bocetos y circuitos prototipo para un sistema de
música pequeño, el último muestra un interés inmediato en el proyecto y, en
unos pocos minutos, edita elementos que traerían uno de los aspectos clave a la
Mystic Box: su calidad de sonido.</p>
<p>Es en ese momento cuando
ambos se dan cuenta de quecon la combinación de la fuerza de la juventud y la
sabiduría y la experiencia de la madurez, serían capaces de crear algo
completamente nuevo y revolucionario.</p>
<p>Ese es el momento en que
nace Klanger.</p>

""The amplifier of the Mystic Box has been developed considering the best design rules for optimum EMC to improve its performance against electromagnetic interference. At the same time, this type of design offers a very good SNR. All this confirms the excellence of the Klanger team."" - Francesc Daura, CEO at CEMDAL.
""My relationship with music is since I was very young, when my father gave me my first Spanish guitar. I studied music and became so fond of it that I have to admit that, for me, it's a daily necessity. I have had several stereos, but my surprise was to get to know Klanger. In addition to an absolute formal simplicity, what has really excited me is the quality and freshness of how my favorite musicians sound. The timbre of the guitar, at a generous volume, is realistic and at the same time it doesn't show the pomposity that many stereos add, but the guitar definitely doesn't have."" - Fernando Navarro, musician.
Art


Elegance and simplicity. For the design of the Mystic Box, our inspiration came from the work of Kasimir Malevich, an artist who founded the Suprematism, a movement which focuses on basic geometric shapes.
For us, each piece is so special that it is built, painted and polished by hand to give that unique human touch which transforms it into a work of art - a music system you enjoy even when switched off.


Science









It's all about art, science and passion. Creating beautiful shapes and solid structures to achieve the best sound quality is far from being an easy task.
As an example, fast and high pressure air changes in speaker enclosures can cause vibration patterns which add coloration to the music.
A carefully designed enclosure and the adequate combination of structural materials give the cabinets of the Mystic Box strength and stability, not allowing for any coloration.

Designed for people







Ease of use: One of the concepts which came to our minds when designing the Mystic Box. We create music systems, hence we design them for listening to music, not for wasting your valuable time with complicated configurations or settings.
The Mystic Box has an easy-to-use, neat interface. Just a volume control and a power switch. There’s no need for anything else.
Now, where's the volume control? It's in the cross, the mystic cross. Just touch its upper or lower part to change it.
And the wireless setup? Same concept: Ease of use. Pair it just once with your device and it's done forever.

Wireless





Stream your music collection directly from your mobile phone, tablet, DAC, TV or computer via Bluetooth or by cable.
Access infinite music libraries with your device: from your own music to streaming services, you'll be able to play it through the Mystic Box instantly.

Just press play and let the Mystic Box carry out the rest. Done.Become the center of the actionGreat movies aren't as great if the sound is not up to par. Here is the Mystic Box. Connect it to your TV's audio output and live a completely new experience. 
In addition, as the Mystic Box is so compact, you'll be able to place it anywhere.

Audiophile processing



The speakers of the Mystic Box having small cabinets need special dedication to produce a big sound. Audiophile quality digital signal processing (DSP) and digital to analog conversion (DAC) at 192kHz/24 bit is applied to fine tune the system. There’s no better way to feel all the emotion of your favourite music.
It also continuously analyzes the output for delivering powerful yet controlled sound, no matter how loud, by controlling the driver's excursion at high volume levels and instantly reducing it to protect the speakers against damage and avoid those annoying distortions. Yes, your party will last all night!

Incredible efficiency



Electronic devices have losses, and these losses are wasted energy, mostly in form of heat. To reduce them, we have designed the Mystic Box to be highly energy efficient. Combining our switching technology with carefully designed printed circuit boards and high quality components, its efficiency reaches levels above 90%.
This means that it does not need big heat sinks, heavy transformers or voluminous enclosures, resulting in a smaller, lighter and more reliable device.
A smaller size also requires less materials in the manufacturing processes, involving lower costs and lower greenhouse gas emissions.
Less is more

To minimise the carbon footprint of our business we have striven to reduce the amount of materials needed for the Mystic Box and combine this with efficient manufacturing techniques in order to make the most out of every cubic centimetre / inch of material, as well as using the least possible amount of energy during the process.
We have incorporated 3D printing in the industrial processes. Additive manufacturing allows us to make zero-waste parts, as the printers only add the material needed, i.e. not removing excess from a block of material as classic industrial processes do.
But this not being enough for us, we have aimed to manufacture the Mystic Box with more than 60% of recycled raw materials, the remaining 40% coming from certified and responsible sources.

Responsibility


In order to maintain our high standards in product quality, health & safety and our commitment to the environment, our suppliers must live up to the toughest standards in the industry.
It is for this reason that before we choose a supplier, we evaluate their facilities so as to comply with our quality, safety and environment directives.
All of our suppliers fulfil quality standards ISO 9001:2008, UL 94V-0 and environmental ISO 14001:2004.
We want to offer you a high quality, responsibly manufactured and environmentally friendly product, and we think that this is the only way this can be achieved.

Empowering the small




We believe in the local industry infrastructure, so the Mystic Box is completely manufactured and assembled at less than 50 km / 30 miles from our headquarters.
We also think that the real value of a product lies in the passion and dedication of every person taking part in the project during the design and manufacturing processes. There's passionate artisanal work in the creation of every Mystic Box that makes each piece unique. And we are proud of it.
Tech Specs











Behind the scenes


We have designed the back panel to be neat and easy. The Mystic Box comes with one stereo, gold-plated RCA input for connection of almost every device, a power plug, an on/off switch and two speaker outputs. All fitted in a beautiful, single black anodized aluminum panel.
Where we are

The Mystic Box is the result of nearly three years of development of a single idea: to make a beautiful, efficient and incredibly good sounding music system. A project that started from a single PCB design of a small power amplifier and which has evolved into a full compact Hi-Fi system. A tech-marvel inside a work of art.


It has been an exciting journey to arrive where we are now: The electronics have been completely re-designed with new features such as Bluetooth and dedicated amps for each speaker, upgraded premium and more efficient components, a better PCB design for an even higher SNR and the addition of a DSP core that keeps everything under control.




Now, the Mystic Box is close to reality. We also have re-designed the drive unit accomodation pieces of the cabinets to achieve a new stage of sound quality and developed a bigger amp enclosure to accomodate all the new electronics and touch sensitive volume control. These modifications also involve lower production costs and a more exact reproduction of Malevich's paintings.
After hours of simulation, we have finally created a new prototype, modifying parts of the old version and 3D printing the new ones.






We want to change consumer electronics to high efficiency, recyclable and responsibly manufactured products, designed with the only premise of making people enjoy them for years with no programmed obsolescense. 
This is our philosophy: Create incredible products to make people happier, things easier and the world greener. This is our contribution to change the world.


 
The team







A bit of history


For developing the Mystic Box we have created Klanger, an audio startup company based in Barcelona. The company has been founded by Martí Castany and Andreas Manz, two music and technology enthusiasts who met by chance in 2013.
The initial idea starts when, in 2011, 19-year-old Martí begins toying with the idea of offering the world a combination of what he loves: music, art and technology. At this time it is only a dream, an idea which needs maturing.
Active critic of music system wherever he goes, from parties to clothing stores and bars, Martí finally decides that the best way to join all his requirements in sound systems would be to create them by himself.
His first speakers see the light in 2011. Modern looking and with a great performance, they are designed for Hi-Fi systems to be used in large spaces. Proud of the results and tired of the poor sound quality of mobile phones, portable music players, tablets, computers and the external devices that are used to play them, Martí proposes to design a complete compact system, with a sound quality not achieved so far, combined with maximum energy efficiency, a commitment to the environment and ease of use.

In the meantime, Xavier Vidal introduces him to the Black Square and the rest of the work of Kazimir Malevich, which immediately becomes Martí’s inspiration for the aesthetic design of the system.

Andreas, german self-employed engineer with 35 years of experience in design, installation and repair of high quality Hi-Fi systems and specialized in analog hardware, has the dream of working with young people in a project related with energy efficiency and sound quality, bored by the amounts of wasted energy in classic systems and in this way transfer his knowledge and experience to the next generation.

When in mid-2013 Martí meets Andreas through a common acquaintance and invites him to his garage, where he has some sketches and prototype PCBs for a small music system, the latter shows immediate interest in the project and, in a few minutes, edits elements which would bring one of the key aspects to the Mystic Box: Its sound quality.

It is at that moment when both realize that combining the strength of youth with the wisdom and experience of maturity, they would be able to create something completely new and revolutionary, something incredible.

That is the moment when Klanger is born.

We need your help


We are ready to go. We have created our small startup company, the
circuit and case designs are finished and tested, and the sound tests done with
thrilling results. The most advanced PCB and component insertion/testing companies
await our go ahead, as well as an experienced carpenter who has incorporated
the latest technologies to his traditional family business.
Now we need the funding to buy the materials and parts, get the CE and

¿Por qué deberías disfrutar de un sistema de
música solamente cuando está encendido?

Presentamos la Mystic Box, un sistema de música atractivo, compacto y de alta eficiencia energética
diseñado para llenar tu hogar con una sorprendente calidad de sonido. Una obra
de arte para disfrutar de tu música favorita como nunca antes.

""El amplificador de la
Mystic Box ha sido desarrollado teniendo en cuenta las mejores reglas de diseño
para una óptima EMC y así mejorar su respuesta frente a las interferencias
electromagnéticas. Al mismo tiempo, este tipo de diseño ofrece una muy buena relación
señal/ruido. Todo esto confirma la excelencia del equipo Klanger.""-
Francesc Daura, CEO en CEMDAL.

""Mi relación con la música es desde muy pequeño, cuando mi padre me regaló miprimera guitarra española. Estudié música y me aficioné de tal forma que tengo que admitir que, para mí, es una necesidad diaria. He tenido diversos equipos de sonido, pero mi sorpresa fue conocer Klanger. A una simplicidad formal absoluta se le añade lo que realmente me entusiasmó: la calidad y frescura con que suenan mis músicos favoritos. El timbre de la guitarra, con un volumen generoso, es realista y a la vez sin esa pomposidad que muchos aparatos le añaden y que la guitarra, definitivamente, no tiene."" Fernando Navarro, músico. 



Arte



Elegancia y sencillez.
Para el diseño de la Mystic Box , nuestra inspiración vino de la obra de
Kasimir Malevich, artista que fundó el suprematismo, un movimiento que se
centra en formas geométricas básicas.


Para nosotros cada pieza
es tan especial que se construye, pinta y pule a mano para darle ese único
toque humano que la transforma en una obra de arte - un sistema de música que
se disfruta incluso cuando está apagado.


Ciencia



Se trata de arte, ciencia
y pasión. Crear formas bellas y estructuras sólidas para lograr la mejor
calidad de sonido está lejos de ser tarea fácil.
A modo de ejemplo, los
cambios de aire rápidos y de alta presión presentes en recintos de altavoces
pueden causar patrones de vibración que añaden coloración a la música.
Un recinto cuidadosamente
diseñado y la combinación adecuada de materiales estructurales dan a los recintos
de la Mystic Box una fuerza y estabilidad que no permiten ningún tipo de
coloración.


Diseñada para las personas



Facilidad de uso: uno de
los conceptos que vino a nuestra mente al diseñar la Mystic Box. Creamos
equipos de música. Por lo tanto, los diseñamos para escuchar música, no para que
pierdas tu valioso tiempo con configuraciones o ajustes complicados.
La Mystic Box tiene una
interfaz nítida y fácil de usar. Solo un control de volumen y un interruptor de
encendido. No hay necesidad de nada más.
Ahora, ¿dónde está el
control de volumen? Está en la cruz, la cruz mística. Solo tienes que tocar su
parte superior o inferior para cambiarlo.
Y la configuración
inalámbrica? El mismo concepto: facilidad de uso. Emparéjala solamente una vez
con tu dispositivo y estará hecho para siempre.



Inalámbrica



Reproduce tu colección de
música directamente desde tu teléfono móvil, tableta, DAC, televisor o PC vía
Bluetooth o por cable.
Accede a infinitas
bibliotecas de música con tu dispositivo: desde tu propia música hasta los
servicios de streaming, serás capaz de reproducirlo todo a través de la Mystic Box
al instante.
Solo pulsa reproducir y
deja que la Mystic Box se ocupe del resto. Hecho.


Conviértete en el centro de la acción



Las grandes películas no
son tan grandes si el sonido no está a la par. He aquí la Mystic Box.
Conéctala a la salida de
audio de tu televisor y vive una experiencia completamente nueva.
Además, como la Mystic Box
es tan compacta, podrás colocarla en cualquier lugar.



Procesamiento de audiófilo


Las cajas acústicas de la
Mystic Box, al ser de tamaño reducido, necesitan una dedicación especial para
producir un gran sonido. Se aplica un procesamiento de señal digital (DSP) y una
conversión digital/analógica (DAC) de calidad audiófila a 192kHz/24 bits para
afinar el sistema. No existe mejor manera de sentir toda la emoción de tu
música favorita.
También analiza
continuamente la salida de audio para entregar un sonido potente pero
controlado, sin importar a qué volumen, controlando la excursión del altavoz a
niveles altos de escucha y reduciéndola al instante para proteger los altavoces
contra daños y evitar esas molestas distorsiones. Sí, ¡su fiesta durará toda la
noche!

Eficiencia increíble





Los aparatos electrónicos
tienen pérdidas, y estas pérdidas son energía desperdiciada, sobre todo en
forma de calor. Para reducirlas, hemos diseñado la Mystic Box para ser
altamente eficiente. Combinando nuestra tecnología de conmutación con circuitos
impresos cuidadosamente diseñados y componentes de alta calidad, su eficiencia
alcanza niveles superiores al 90%.
Esto significa que no
necesita grandes disipadores de calor, transformadores pesados o recintos voluminosos,
resultando en un dispositivo más pequeño, más ligero y más fiable.
Un tamaño más pequeño
también requiere menos materiales en los procesos de fabricación, lo que
implica menores costes y menos emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero.

Menos es más


Para reducir al mínimo nuestra
huella de carbono nos hemos esforzado por reducir la cantidad de materiales
necesarios para la fabricación de la Mystic Box y lo hemos combinado con
técnicas de fabricación eficientes con el fin de sacar el máximo provecho de
cada centímetro cúbico de material, así como usar la menor cantidad posible de
energía durante el proceso.
También hemos incorporado
impresión 3D en los procesos industriales. La fabricación aditiva nos permite
hacer piezas con cero desechos, dado que las impresoras solo añaden el material
necesario, es decir, no eliminan el exceso de un bloque de material como lo
hacen los procesos industriales clásicos.
Pero al no ser esto
suficiente para nosotros, nos hemos puesto el objetivo de fabricar la Mystic Box
con más del 60% de materias primas recicladas, y el 40% restante proveniente de
fuentes certificadas y responsables.

Responsabilidad



Con el fin de mantener
nuestros altos estándares en la calidad de producto, salud y seguridad y nuestro
compromiso con el medio ambiente, nuestros proveedores deben cumplir con los más
exigentes estándares de la industria.
Es por esta razón por la
que antes de que elijamos a un proveedor, evaluamos si sus instalaciones cumplen
con nuestras directrices de calidad, seguridad y medio ambiente.
Todos nuestros proveedores
cumplen los estándares de calidad ISO 9001: 2008, UL 94V-0 y medioambiental ISO
14001: 2004.
Queremos ofrecerte un
producto de alta calidad, fabricado de forma responsable y respetuoso con el
medio ambiente, y creemos que esta es la única forma de lograrlo.


Potenciando al pequeño



Creemos en la infraestructura
industria local, por lo que la Mystic Box está fabricada y montada por completo
a menos de 50 km de nuestra sede.
También creemos que el
valor real de un producto radica en la pasión y dedicación de todas las
personas que participan en el proyecto durante los procesos de diseño y
fabricación. Hay un apasionado trabajo artesanal en la creación de cada Mystic Box
que hace que cada pieza sea única. Y estamos muy orgullosos de ello.




Especificaciones técnicas




Entre bastidores


Hemos diseñado el panel
posterior para ser nítido y fácil. La Mystic Box viene con una entrada estéreo con
conectores RCA chapados en oro para la conexión de casi todos los dispositivos,
un conector de alimentación, el interruptor de encendido y dos salidas de
altavoz. Todo montado en un hermoso y único panel de aluminio anodizado negro.




Dónde estamos


La Mystic Box es el
resultado de casi tres años de desarrollo de una idea: hacer un sistema de
música bello, eficiente y que suene increíblemente bien. Un proyecto que se
inició a partir de un diseño de un pequeño amplificador de potencia y que ha
evolucionado hasta convertirse en un sistema compacto de alta fidelidad completo.
Una maravilla tecnológica dentro de una obra de arte.





Ha sido un emocionante
hasta llegar donde estamos ahora: la electrónica ha sido completamente
re-diseñada con nuevas características tales como Bluetooth y amplificadores
dedicados para cada altavoz, componentes premium mejorados y más eficientes, un
mejor diseño del circuito para una relación señal/ruido aún mayor y la adición
de un núcleo de procesamiento digital que lo mantiene todo bajo control.



Ahora, la Mystic Box está
cerca de ser una realidad. También hemos rediseñado el alojamiento de los
altavoces en los recintos para alcanzar un nuevo nivel en la calidad del sonido
y hemos desarrollado un recinto amplificador más grande para dar cabida a toda
la nueva electrónica y al control de volumen táctil. Estas modificaciones
también implican menores costos de producción y una reproducción más exacta de
las pinturas de Malevich.
Después de horas de
simulación, hemos creado un nuevo prototipo modificando partes de la versión
antigua e imprimiendo de nuevas con impresión 3D.





Queremos cambiar la
electrónica de consumo a productos de alta eficiencia energética, reciclables y
fabricados de manera responsable, diseñados con la única premisa de hacer que
la gente disfrute de ellos durante años sin obsolescencia programada.
Esta es nuestra
filosofía: crear productos increíbles para hacer que la gente más feliz, las
cosas más fáciles y el mundo más verde. Esta es nuestra contribución para
cambiar el mundo.


El equipo






Un poco de historia


Para el desarrollo de la Mystic
Box hemos creado Klanger, una startup con sede en Barcelona. La compañía ha
sido fundada por Martí Castany y Andreas Manz, dos entusiastas de la música y
la tecnología que se conocieron por casualidad en 2013.
La idea inicial comienza cuando,
en 2011, con 19 años, Martí comienza a jugar con la idea de ofrecer al mundo
una combinación de lo que más le gusta: la música, el arte y la tecnología. En
ese momento es solo un sueño, una idea que necesita madurar.
Crítico activo de sistemas
de música donde quiera que vaya, desde fiestas hasta tiendas de ropa o bares,
Martí finalmente decide que la mejor manera de unir todos sus requerimientos en
sistemas de sonido sería que las creara él mismo.
Sus primeras cajas
acústicas ven la luz en el año 2011. De aspecto moderno y con un gran rendimiento,
están diseñados para sistemas de alta fidelidad que se usen en grandes
espacios. Orgulloso de los resultados y cansado de la mala calidad de sonido de
los teléfonos móviles, reproductores de música portátiles, tabletas,
ordenadores y los dispositivos externos que se utilizan para conectarlos, Martí
se propone el diseño de un sistema compacto completo con una calidad de sonido
no lograda hasta ahora, combinado con una máxima eficiencia energética,
compromiso con el medio ambiente y facilidad de uso.
Mientras tanto, Xavier
Vidal le introduce al Cuadrado Negro y al resto de la obra de Kazimir Malevich,
que se convierte de inmediato en la inspiración de Martí para el diseño
estético del sistema.
Andreas, ingeniero alemán autoempleado
con 35 años de experiencia en diseño, instalación y reparación de sistemas
Hi-Fi de alta calidad y especializado en hardware analógico, tiene el sueño de
trabajar con jóvenes en un proyecto relacionado con la eficiencia energética y
la calidad de sonido, aburrido de las cantidades de energía que se desperdician
en los sistemas clásicos, y de este modo transferir su conocimiento y
experiencia a las siguientes generaciones.
Cuando a mediados de 2013
Martí se encuentra con Andreas a través de un amigo común y lo invita a su
garaje donde tiene algunos bocetos y circuitos prototipo para un sistema de
música pequeño, el último muestra un interés inmediato en el proyecto y, en
unos pocos minutos, edita elementos que traerían uno de los aspectos clave a la
Mystic Box: su calidad de sonido.
Es en ese momento cuando
ambos se dan cuenta de quecon la combinación de la fuerza de la juventud y la
sabiduría y la experiencia de la madurez, serían capaces de crear algo
completamente nuevo y revolucionario.
Ese es el momento en que
nace Klanger.


Necesitamos tu ayuda



Estamos listos para despegar.
Hemos creado nuestra pequeña startup, los diseños de los circuitos y los
recintos están terminados y probados y las pruebas de sonido han dado
resultados increíbles. Las empresas más avanzadas de circuitos impresos y de
inserción de componentes y pruebas esperan nuestra señal para empezar, así como
un carpintero experimentado que ha incorporado las últimas tecnologías a su
negocio familiar tradicional.
Ahora necesitamos los
fondos para comprar las piezas y los materiales, obtener las certificaciones CE
y FCC y comenzar la fabricación de nuestro primer producto.

What has improved?
BUILT-IN MICROPHONE
This is added as a new feature. With this microphone, you can do so much more with the new earBeans than just listening to music. Click once to pick up call; Long press to activate voice control; Press the microphone once to pause a song and press it twice to skip to the next song.
  
   
NOISE-ISOLATING BUDS
You reduce noise because it interferes with how your ears perceive the sound that you want to hear, like music, or the voice of a loved one. The noise-isolation buds are added to enhance your audio experience and ear comfort at the same time. The noise-isolating buds also work as a cover and support for your earBeans |Bass|.
 
  
TWO KINDS OF JACKSWe evolve with technology. earBeans |Bass| has two headphone jack varieties: AUX jack and USB-C jack. earBeans Bass in USB-C jack earBeans Bass in AUX jack What stays the same? SAME LIGHT-WEIGHTWe like how light the earBeans are, so we want to keep the weight the same. The earBeans |Bass| weight remains at only 9 grams.  SAME COMFORTDesigned after the bean-shaped contour of the ears, the upper and lower part of earBeans |Bass| act as supporting points to prevent the earBeans |Bass| from falling. You can put it on for hours while doing your daily routine without feeling discomfort in your ears. Try sleeping with it too! Play chill music from earBeans |Bass| to lull you to sleep. Put on some music and focus on the task at hand! Stroll around town for hours with earBeans |Bass| earBeans |Bass| will stay in your ear, even when you're exercising SAME FREESTYLE WEARINGWe keep in mind that no two ears are alike.

It's simple, 
Rika (Pronounced ree-ka) is a project that has been developing for over a year now. We started out with another product, but due to some issues we had to cancel it. Since that time we have been researching and developing something that would be not only different but something that was useful. 
We wanted to make something that was going to be small, portable, but packed a punch. throw in a mic and this is what you get The Rika Impact. Designed to give you more with out compromising. 


Size
Portable has a whole new meaning. Being smaller than half the size of a can of soda the Rika Impact is able to go wherever you go without taking up space. Measuring in at 2 inches in width and 2 inches tall you can take this speaker wherever you want to go. 


Bluetooth This product is compatible with most Bluetooth devices and is simple to connect to. Simple turn the device to the ""On"" position and then turn your Bluetooth on in your settings.Once you have done this you should see the name ""RIKA"" appear. Once this happens you can click on the name and connect with the speaker. You should hear a sound once it has been connected. If you don't hear sound simply repeat the process over again. This product is compatible with most Bluetooth devices and is simple to connect to. Simple turn the device to the ""On"" position and then turn your Bluetooth on in your settings.  


Most devices wont ask for a Password, but if it does, just enter ""0000"" and hit enter. This will connect your phone to the device. 

Once connected you are ready to go. Begin to play your music and enjoy the clear crisp sound. 
To skip a song simple push the ""+"" button to move forward and the ""-"" button to move back. Those same buttons are also used as a volume control simply by holding the button down. 
To play or pause a song push the middle button. This will also answer phone callswith one push and will be used to hang up when you are done.



Charging 
Charging is simple. Our device will charge with a usb port and we have even included the cord in all of our boxes. Charging time usually take around 2-2.5 hours and each charge will last between 4-5 hours when device is in use and the volume is all the way up. Time will increase if the volume is down or if you connect the speaker using the direct line. 


You can connect to the speaker with a cord provided in each order if you choose.

<h3>Let's get creative</h3>
<p>
Because the AxiomAir is manufactured in our
factory in Canada, we can create an almost endless variety of finishes to suit
your decor. The body of the AxiomAir comes in two stock finishes:  <b><span>black and white. </span></b>Then
choose a grille finish and customize the lid in wood grain, a solid color, or
even a picture of your favourite person, place or thing – the choice really is
yours! We also offer a custom paint
matching service if you want your entire AxiomAir to match your walls and
disappear into your room.</p>

</h3><h3>You've got the power</h3><div data-id=""3952402"">
<p>
What does 150 watts of continuous output really
mean? A lot of companies list their peak power output – the levels they
can hit for an explosion, for example, but not sustain across an epic guitar
solo. Axiom only lists continuous power ratings. 150 watts (2 x 75
watts per channel) is enough sound output to make a presentation clearly
audible in a room of 50 people. Or to allow your neighbours to enjoy the
party, too!</p>

<p>
Bluetooth® is made to transmit voice from your
headset to your phone – not to carry full-spectrum high-resolution sound. Using a Wi-Fi® network instead means you've got three times the usable
range, can play high resolution audio without compression, can have more than
one user at a time, and can have them all over your home controlled from any
device on your network (together or individually).</p>
<h3>Wi-Fi® and the User Interface</h3>
<div data-id=""3951705"">
<p> 

The user interface was designed to be a
convenient way to play any song in your user library, across as many AxiomAirs
as you have in your home. Play in just one room or across all the
AxiomAir-enabled rooms in your home.</p>
<p>
The main page shows the Artist, Album Name, and
Song for what is currently playing. It
also has a list of what you have selected as your current playlist. You
can add songs to this running playlist, regardless of their location on your network. You can also move songs around or remove them
from you running playlist. </p>

high-resolution music files, you can easily access that hard drive from your
AxiomAir with just a few clicks.<p></p>

AxiomAir is a portable wireless speaker for
people who are passionate about their music. No comprises here:

AxiomAir is a real Hi-Fi system in one sleek
speaker.














 
AxiomAir believes you should have choices:


After more than 3 years of development, we've created a speaker that meets all of your needs and more.

 
 


 

 Choose finishes that match your decor.

 Real wood tops are hand sanded, stained and finished.

 Provide your room's paint colour for a customized look that integrates seamlessly into your space.
Let's get creative

Because the AxiomAir is manufactured in our
factory in Canada, we can create an almost endless variety of finishes to suit
your decor. The body of the AxiomAir comes in two stock finishes:  black and white. Then
choose a grille finish and customize the lid in wood grain, a solid color, or
even a picture of your favourite person, place or thing – the choice really is
yours! We also offer a custom paint
matching service if you want your entire AxiomAir to match your walls and
disappear into your room.

 Customizing your AxiomAir to suit your personal style is easy!

 We can integrate your own custom images and finishes to suit your personal style

 We can even customize your lid with a picture of your cats – not that we would recommend doing that!






How do you know you're getting a better-sounding speaker?We've literally spent over 35 years researching sound and how to get the highest possible output from the smallest possible footprint. This research infuses every aspect of the AxiomAir.









Watch the Tech Talk Video

You've got the power

What does 150 watts of continuous output really
mean? A lot of companies list their peak power output – the levels they
can hit for an explosion, for example, but not sustain across an epic guitar
solo. Axiom only lists continuous power ratings. 150 watts (2 x 75
watts per channel) is enough sound output to make a presentation clearly
audible in a room of 50 people. Or to allow your neighbours to enjoy the
party, too!
Why No Bluetooth?   






Bluetooth® is made to transmit voice from your
headset to your phone – not to carry full-spectrum high-resolution sound. Using a Wi-Fi® network instead means you've got three times the usable
range, can play high resolution audio without compression, can have more than
one user at a time, and can have them all over your home controlled from any
device on your network (together or individually).
Wi-Fi® and the User Interface

 

The user interface was designed to be a
convenient way to play any song in your user library, across as many AxiomAirs
as you have in your home. Play in just one room or across all the
AxiomAir-enabled rooms in your home.

The main page shows the Artist, Album Name, and
Song for what is currently playing. It
also has a list of what you have selected as your current playlist. You
can add songs to this running playlist, regardless of their location on your network. You can also move songs around or remove them
from you running playlist. 






Use the interface to easily add more devices to your Axiom network.
 
Use the interface to update your AxiomAir operating system as new
formats and developments happen.

If you've got a separate hard drive on your network with your
high-resolution music files, you can easily access that hard drive from your
AxiomAir with just a few clicks.

 

Become the best sounding Karaoke singer
Add the optional Karaoke module with our proprietary feedback-killing circuitry and two microphone inputs. AxiomAir becomes your Karaoke machine, with music volume, microphone volume, and echo level all controlled from the user interface. 






Make an impression on the group

Give presentations that sound better than anyone else's. No really – the Karaoke module also works for presentations, so your AxiomAir becomes a portable sound system that will broadcast your voice with crystal clarity and no feedback even in rooms with hundreds of people.






Take the big screen with you


Pictured below we have a mini projector hooked
to AxiomAir creating your own portable Movie Theatre.  We are using ChromeCast (AppleTV is another
option) to send the movie wirelessly to the projector.






Bang for the Buck


If you were to purchase a high-quality
Digital-to-Analog-Converter (DAC), a 150-watt amplifier, the Axiom M3 speakers,
a micro-computer, and the power supply it would cost more than $1,400! But
the AxiomAir sells for just $799.

 











 Ian Colquhoun
Ian founded Axiom in 1980, and for over 35 years he has relentlessly pursued one goal: to amplify emotions by creating the most true-to-life audio experience possible.  He was part of a decade-long research project at the National Research Center in Ottawa, Canada, that changed the way the world measured loudspeaker sound.  Most weekends he can be found kicking around his anechoic chamber working on new sound reproduction ideas.  Music is his life. 





Andrew Welker
Andrew is a brilliant loudspeaker, amplifier, and digital hardware designer who has a broad knowledge of everything audio and a particular expertise in the science relating to the omni-directional psychoacoustical effects of loudspeaker reproduction.  After graduating with a degree in Electrical Engineering Andrew went on to join the R&D team at API (Audio Products International), where he worked for over 10 years.  He joined Axiom in 2009 and has been the lead designer on the AxiomAir, fulfilling many personal wish-list items with this product:  a portable, wireless speaker that an audiophile could be proud to own.





Michelangelo Guarise
Michelangelo lives in Florence, Italy, and works passionately on marrying technology with music.  A lifelong Maker, Michelangelo founded RaspyFi.com, the predecessor to Volumio.org.  He focuses on the cognitive aspects of user interactions and physical computing, and he has been a world leader in freeing high-resolution music from traditional wired set ups so that it can be played from a smartphone, tablet or PC. 





Vlad Muller
Vlad studied industrial design for 4 years in Uherske Hradiste  and at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague (a 6-year Master of Arts [Design and sculpture] degree programme).  His experience spans a wide range of disciplines from office furniture and household objects to toys and consumer electronics.  He is passionate about marrying the masculine and the feminine to create designs which are universally appealing.





John G Paton
Paton has been working with Axiom in various capacities since before its inception.  He is a lifelong Audiophile and John and Ian built the very first pair of speakers together in the late 1970s.  Little did they know at the time where it would all be 36 years later.  His musical tastes are wide-ranging and eclectic and he has long recognized the ‘power of music and rhythm  to creep into the secret places of the soul’.  (H.T. to Plato).  





FAQ

<p>Here's why we're running an Indiegogo campaign. ""Middle-screen webcam"" is a new category of webcam. When we started this in January, we had cameras and a question. What if we're not the only ones that wish the camera was somewhere other than the edge of the screen? At that time, we'd already been buying the camera, and were ready to rock. We blew through our initial goal and hit 702% funded in 21 days on Kickstarter. We came over here, and about a month into our Indiegogo campaign found out we could no longer buy the previous chip used in our previous camera. We went through another 5 months of delays and development, and are finally shipping. The support has been tremendous, and we've used the time to improve Center Cam. The clip is now injection molded. The camera head is now reinforced. Updated mic. Upgraded USB cabling. We would like to continue to get the tech in the hands of people who believe in it FIRST- our crowdfunding supporters.</p>
<p>We're going to give our backers a discount from our projected retail price of $153.99 for a single Center Cam unit, as well as prioritized fulfillment of Center Cam. This will be the fastest way to get a Center Cam.</p>

Now, Monument is even smarter to organize all of your memories by people, scenery, location, camera and more while eliminating duplicates — automatically. It's more intuitive and without clutter.  
 
With built-in SSD, Monument provides you the reliability that you can trust for your precious memories. SSD is the fastest, most reliable storage technology. That’s what you need for your photos! You can also use choose the diskless model to use existing USB drives for storage and add more capacity when you need more.  There's no limit with the storage capacity to use with Monument 2. If you plug in a 12TB USB drive or an SSD module, then you will have 12TB storage.   Monument 2 offers two models according to your storage needs:  This model includes a built-in SSD storage. You do not need to plug in anything else. The storage capacity can be upgraded by simply exchanging the SSD module in the future.  This model does not have a built-in SSD storage. You can add your own:- external USB Drive or- M.2 2280 SSD module to use as your storage.  For example, if you plug in a 2TB drive, then you will have 2TB storage space. * Diskless model also comes with the M.2 SSD connector on it. This allows you to add your own SSD module in the future.  
 
 
 Monument 2 can now be accessed from any computer as a network drive. This is a pretty big feature that allows users to:
Quickly access all content directly as they are stored on the drives
Use the Dropbox folder to quickly drag and drop photos/videos to be imported into Monument library
Use Smart Folders to browse by locations, cameras, tags etc. without launching the Monument app
Store other files types other than photos and videos
 
 
 Automatically back up all of your photos and videos from your devices: phones, computers, hard drives, SD cards and cloud accounts.   Using a camera? Just plug in the SD card to Monument - that's it! You do not need to turn on your computer to sync photos.  Compact Flash Cards can also be imported using USB readers.  
 
 Preserve the original, highest level or quality of your photos. Monument supports the most common RAW formats.   
 Photos and videos that are already backed up can be removed to save up space from your phones.  
 
 Monument mirrors the contents to another USB drive (RAID-1) or to a network drive (NAS) automatically.  
 Import your existing folders and Monument will automatically carry over the folder/album structure. So you can keep things the way they are.  
 Simply plug in the drive and Monument handles the rest by scanning all photos and videos by eliminating duplicates and sorting them like magic. 
 
 Put your private data on Monument with advanced security that protects what's yours. Only you have the access - no compromises! 
 Giving away your private data could leave you vulnerable to misuse of data, hacking or manipulation. Many companies collect personal information by processing your photos in the cloud, it means they can use or sell your personal information.End-to-end encryption gives you the confidence to keep your content completely secure and private. There are no ads, data mining, or user profiling. Your data never leaves Monument and it is processed locally. The built-in Neural Processing Unit (NPU) allows Monument to analyze your content to recognize faces, scenery and other properties locally, on your device.  
 
 Add password protection to your photos and keep your private items safe and always under your control.   
 
 Spread the joy by inviting your friends and family and share your albums and photos with them. Just select the photos or albums you'd like to share and Monument automatically creates a secure sharable link for you.  You can also add additional users to your Monument and share photos and albums effortlessly.  
Sharing with users on Monument
 
Share photos with anyone using secure links.
 
 With its cutting-edge performance, Monument gives you everything you need: speed, smarts and privacy —above and beyond without any monthly fees. Monument is moving the processing power to edge and using Artificial Intelligence to provide cloud-level photo management experience without compromising security and privacy. This gives us a massive advantage to use the processing power and the storage on the local device with no infrastructure cost.  Unlike public cloud services, Monument does not process, collect, use or share any personal data. You keep the ownership and have full control over your content.  
 
 
 
 You can use Monument as an alternative to Google Photos and iCloud or as a secondary backup to keep everything under your control. Monument does not require any additional fees.  With Google sunsetting its free unlimited storage plan, you can switch to Monument 2 and enjoy a comprehensive suite of features to centralize and manage your photos while keeping your personal data private and without paying any monthly fees. Monument does not analyze your photos to serve you ads or influence your choices.  If you're an iCloud user and looking for an alternative, Monument 2 can help you stop paying monthly fees. Also with Monument, you are not locked into a single platform and can share content across all of your devices: Windows, Android, Mac and iOS.   
 
 
 
 
 
 The photo editing feature allows you to tweak your photos without leaving the Monument app. You can crop, color correct, change orientation and even apply a wide range of filters. The best part is that after editing your photo, both the edited and original versions are stored on your Monument. Full List of Image Editor Features:
 All devices: Edit photos on the go using the Monument app on your phone or on your computer.
 Cropping and rotation: Crop, rotate and transform photos. We even have common social media aspect ratios saved for quick edits. 
 Filters: Add filters to your photos using the intensity slider to customize the filter strength. 
 Adjust: Customize everything from saturation, brightness and contrast to create the impact your photos deserve. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Monument 2 is ten times faster and smarter than its predecessor, it's the world's smartest storage device.  With the addition of  Neural Processing Unit (NPU), it's now more accurate, faster and provides new levels of artificial intelligence that makes Monument smarter than ever. Enjoy high speed on your network using dual band 5GHz WiFi or Gigabit Ethernet.

We've been making camera gear for over 6 years. We're known for our high quality, easy to use sliders and motion control gear. This is our first campaign. We've been dreaming of creating this product since we launched our original Vectorgear Air C4 Slider over 3 years ago. It's been a long time coming but we promise it's going to be worth the wait. </p></div>","We are the Vectorgear team. We have been engaging in photographic equipment for over 6 years. The air C4 is the crystallization of our creativity, dreams, and experience. We have created a two-axis motion control slider with an extremely lightweight and minimal design.  It allows you to carry and use it more easily everywhere you go, from then on you can focus more on your creation.1. Vectorgear air C4 has the best design, and it is the lightest and most cost-effective product among similar products on the market. You will not find a better product for less than $250.2. If you back this campaign, you can get a Vectorgear air C4 slider at the Super Early Bird price of $219. We have fully stocked up. After the crowdfunding is successfully funded, the product will be delivered to you as quickly as possible.Vectorgear Air C4 is a lightweight two-axis electronically controlled slide rail that allows you to track and shoot in the process of lateral movement. It supports video, time-lapse, stop motion animation, and slow-motion shooting. It also comes with an APP, which makes it more convenient to use. Vastly enhancing the control experience. It can bear up to 3kg of equipment (mobile phones, SLRs, cameras, etc.), and it comes with adjustable support feet, which allows it to be mounted on a tripod.Vectorgear Air C4 automates camera movement for interviews, time-lapses and b-roll to save you time and make sure you get the shot on the first take.Thanks to VectorGear Air Slider's universal compatibility, using it with any device you have is made possible! Smartphones, SDLR Cameras, Digital Cameras, GoPros, Osmo Packets and more! If you don’t have a camera, phone or other shooting devices next to you, or are in a tight space, you can set up a move with our new Vectorgear app for iOS devices.Every detail, no matter how small it is, receives our full attention.Here's some quick bullet points if you don't feel like scrolling through the info below:
3kg load-bearing
Horizontal plus surround tracking mode two-axis movement
0.87kg ultra-light weight
All aluminum alloy and minimalist design, it can be called a work of art
Customized motor, taking into account small size, low noise and high torque
Built-in high-performance lithium battery, continuous operation up to 8 hours, time-lapse photography up to 24 hours.
OS and Android (under development) applications provide more convenient and powerful remote control. The app can directly and precisely control the track and video recording.
During the past few years, we have received reviews from reviewers everywhere for different products of ours and you can check them out here. Check out this video, which showcases how to use the Vectorgear Air SliderAir C4 supports multiple shooting modes: video shooting, time-lapse photography, stop motion animation, slow motion, each with specific parameter adjustments to maximize and streamline your shooting process.
Orbital movement brings spatial changes to video shooting, making your video motion effect more exciting.The unique mechanical structure design can achieve the two-axis target shooting effect without adding a motor so that the product always stays in the middle of the screen.The powerful time-lapse photography function allows the camera to achieve step-by-step shooting. You only need to set the filming time and shooting time to automatically generate a moving time-lapse video on the phone.You can also use your camera to shoot.

Never leave your tripod behind again.         We got tired of carrying around heavy, bulky tripods that we never ended up using. Lumapod is specifically designed to be brought on all your adventures.   Instantly capture and share your experiences in the moment.   Of course a fast setup and ultra-compact design are great, but what good is a tripod if it isn’t stable? We carefully selected premium materials like high-grade aluminum and kevlar ropes to ensure reliable stability.   Use it with your Smartphone, GoPro, Mirrorless, DSLR Camera and more...    Easily use it to snap a selfie and then quickly set it down to capture a self-portrait. Either way you can always be in the shot.   When you’re not in the photo, use it as a monopod to shoot lively Hyperlapses    There is more that separates Go85 and Go120 than just their heights (85cm & 120cm). We carefully optimized both models for specific demands.  Lumapod Go85  We relentlessly designed Go85 to be as compact and lightweight as humanly possible without compromising on quality or performance. The result is a perfect travel buddy for your smartphone, GoPro and cameras that weigh up to 1kg / 2.2lbs. Unlike Go120, it does not have interchangeable legs. However, it is equipped with integrated terrain levelers to accommodate for those situations with uneven ground. Lumapod Go120 Go120 has all the benefits of Go85 but with an overall larger height and build that will support cameras that weigh up to 2kg /4.4lbs.    In addition, Go120 has modular leg extensions which creates a wide-range of possibilities for adaptability. It currently comes standard with terrain leveling extensions.   Easily turn your Go120 into a slider with the add-on dolly wheel extensions.   Or firmly stake your Go120 into soft ground, sand or snow with the add-on stake extensions.       Breakdown - Choose Lumapod if you’re looking for better speed, compactness, weight and the adaptability of different leg extensions. Choose a standard tripod if you need extra stability and additional terrain flexibility.     Lumapod is compact with more height, better stability and offers the benefit of having both tripod and selfie mode.  Lumapod offers the same selfie capability but with all the benefits of a stable tripod as well.  Have you ever wondered why all tripods look the same? Is there really only one design that works? We challenged this theory and worked tirelessly to design Lumapod different.There is a simple mechanical principle behind our design: replace compression parts (traditional legs) with tensioning components (Kevlar Ropes). Perhaps it’s easier to understand when compared to something everyone knows:  Much like how the mast on a sailboat withstands wind with its tensioned ropes, we use the same theory to achieve stability. It’s no rocket science but the key to our design is being able to lock and tension Lumapod in any position.  Lumapod’s stability isn’t just by luck. We did extensive research and testing to measure the vibrations and damping of many tripods. Our electro-mechanical test setup enabled us to optimize Lumapod and ensure it is as stable as possible.        Hey! We are Lumapod. We are a small start-up located in Austria who love to travel and take photos.Because we love what we do, the campaign video was made 100% by the team and only with team members and friends.

</ol><p> </p></div>","INDEMAND LIMITED AVAILABILITY!   Following the release of our Quick-Swap Magnetic Filter System in 2019, we are proud to announce the launch of the Freewell Magnetic VND Filter Kit, the world's first versatile magnetic variable ND filter for DSLR and mirrorless cameras.   Providing an extended range of exposure values from two to nine stops using only two filters, the Freewell Magnetic VND Filter Kit is the first-ever all-in-one variable neutral density system that integrates the optical accuracy of hard stop filters with the convenience of a quick-swap magnetic mount. This gives photographers and videographers the most versatile and immediate solution to any shooting need.   Now you have all the filters you need in one single system! The Freewell Magnetic VND Kit includes 7 features (VND2-5, VND6-9, CPL, ND32/CPL, GLOW MIST, VND2-5XMIST and VND6-9XMIST) and a total of 20 functions in one comprehensive kit. You can now meet all your shooting needs on the go in the most compact, handy and cost-effective solution. At equal or even lower quality, nothing like this is available on the market today.Check out the chart below to find out why the Freewell Magnetic VND Filter Kit is absolutely one of a kind!     





 




 
One of the key differences between the Freewell Magnetic VND and every other VND filter is its fully magnetic installation system, which means the filters attach to the front of the lens magnetically. This innovative, patent-pending system works by simply installing the base ring on your camera lens. Then, you will be able to snap or switch your Freewell VND filters in just a few seconds, providing multiple options for any lighting condition. Get ready to shoot outstanding images with incredible ease!
 

 
The Freewell Versatile Magnetic VND Filter Kit is a high-quality and precise magnetic system offering an overall extended range of filtering capability with up to 9 stops (ND4-ND512) in just one quick swap.
 

 
The magnetic adhesion is secure and reliable against vibrations or camera shake while also being easily removable. Freewell Magnetic VND Kit is the ultimate, versatile solution that will take your photo and video production to the next level.
 

 
 


 
Reduce the glare from ocean waves and capture a perfect blue sky with the built-in CPL technology of VND2-5 and VND 6-9/ND32-CPL filters,
 
 
 
or use the MISTXVND base (Glow Mist) lens to soften tones and add creativity to your images, getting pixel-perfect results right on the spot with practically zero post-production adjustments needed.
 

 
Capture what you love in the way you like it! Change, swap and combine the seven filters in twenty different functions... plus one! Yes, the Freewell Magnetic VND kit also offers you full compatibility with the use of our existing Freewell Quick Swap Magnetic ND Filters, easily stackable onto the VND base ring for an additional '+1' option that will turn this VND system into a unique hybrid solution.
 

 
 


 
Made of premium high-definition optical glass with protective coating on both sides, Freewell Magnetic VND filters are waterproof, dustproof, stain proof, oilproof, and scratch-resistant to ensure continuous and reliable performance in any weather or shooting condition.
 

 
All filters included in our Freewell Magnetic VND Kit have been hand-crafted and optimized to be part of a powerful and versatile system capable of delivering sharp images from center to edge without chromatic aberration or loss of detail, and at confirmed zero vignetting on focal lengths over 16mm.
 

 

 



 
Freewell Versatile Magnetic VND Filters boast a highly resistant build quality. Each filter frame is made with precision and durability, delivering quality imaging for countless years to come.
The filter base magnetic joints are secure and precise to ensure improved stability and withstand camera shake while leaving the ring nut securely fixed on the set value.
The metal knurling on the bezel along each ND level of strength helps grip when turning to change values and provides an intuitive touch, which improves the accuracy of stop setting. This provides a smooth, top-notch user experience for both amateurs and pros.
 
 The transition from one stop value to the next is smooth and gradual, which helps to avoid filter overlap and reduce X-pattern occurrences, already effectively solved by the clear control over the maximum and minimum values of each Freewell hard stop VND filter.
 

The practical filter cap, with a transparent Freewell logo on it, is well designed, convenient to use and not bulky when putting it on the filter base for protection during storage or transportation.
 

 
 
 The Freewell Magnetic VND Kit offers the convenience of carrying just two filters with you when traveling or shooting outdoors, with an overall control of 2 to 9 stops whenever you need them. Additionally, a circular polarizer feature is integrated on both filters, plus a GLOW MIST bonus is included in the set for added creativity.  Allowing you to control the amount of light coming into your camera with the use of one single filter, VND filters offers filmmakers the ability to take advantage of a wider aperture in daylight exteriors, highlighting a sharp, clear subject against a blurred background or stabilizing the frame during run-and-gun shooting.  The flexibility offered by the Freewell magnetic VND filters will make this system become the irreplaceable choice for all content creators and photography lovers, including any YouTuber or vlogger in need of the perfect shots spontaneously in any environment or lighting condition.    Freewell filters are accessories that can be taken anywhere. Stored in a convenient, compact and functional case, each filter has a dedicated compartment so you can carry it safely and mount it fast, letting you capture perfect shots instantly with less clutter in your kit.Conveniently save your Freewell filters from dropping and scratching while carrying them in this functional protective case. In addition for all orders received to date, the Freewell Protective Case will be automatically upgraded to the Freewell Protective Case (Premium Edition) as soon as the campaign reaches the US$400,000 funding threshold.    The full set of Freewell Magnetic VND Filters costs almost a third of the price if you were to buy the same set of individual (threaded) filters separately.Check out our comparison chart to see the great deal you will get by purchasing our Freewell Magnetic VND Filter Kit right now!     All you have to do is select the thread size you want and get ready to receive everything you need in one compact package.   For all orders received to date, the Freewell Protective Case will be automatically upgraded to the Freewell Protective Case (Premium Edition) as soon as the campaign reaches the US$400,000 funding threshold. Not sure how to find your camera lens thread size? Here's a tip.  The filter thread size is usually located around the rim printed underneath your lens cap, or written somewhere on the lens barrel.   Thanks to the support of each one of you, our crowdfunding campaign reached the goal we set for ourselves at Freewell, and it placed a milestone for the professional camera filter industry on INDIEGOGO!

By using these in concert Polaris can get its latitude, longitude, and orientation data. With this data, the processor inside Polaris can calculate the rotation of the polar axis. This means there is no need to do a polar axis calibration - which is a critical and time-consuming step when using traditional equatorial mounts.</p><p> </p><p><strong>&gt; Calculation And Auto Tracking</strong></p><p>In order to enable Polaris to trace stars, we designed more inside, not only just those sensors.</p><p>Even exposures as short as 20 seconds can cause the final image to be blurry due to a mix of the earth’s rotation and the magnification effect of the camera lens. Since the rotation angle of the earth in 20 seconds is relatively small - the electric compass and GPS aren’t able to necessarily determine the change. In order to properly trace the stars and prevent streaks - a high-precision hall angular sensor inside Polaris, together with a reduction gearbox structure, can reach an extreme control precision of up to 0.01˚ (36 arc seconds) - which is equal to the amount the earth rotates in 2.5 seconds. This means that we can capture the stars with a longer exposure, and can get the same result as you would get with a 2.5-second exposure. Your shots will be clear, sharp, and leave out the blurry star trails.</p><p> </p><p><strong>&gt;Increased Tracking Accuracy</strong></p><p>After additional verification - the tracking accuracy of Polaris is able to be increased by four times. That is 0.0025 ° (9 arc seconds). This is achieved by increasing the deceleration ratio of the transmission structure. </p><p>we have added a visual correction function to Polaris. When you use Polaris for long exposure deep-sky shooting, Polaris will take a set of photos, each of which is a long exposure. After each photo is taken, Polaris will recognize the precise position of each star in the frame and correct for the movement/direction of the camera. This helps to avoid shooting for tens of minutes or having to continually reset positioning and restarting shots for hours. After the shooting is complete - Polaris will align and stack the photos captured to create an ultra-long exposure photo.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615799257/mcgalt8ndmxfbnxjk44v.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615799271/jlbzbgluqshtmsn9isla.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Being challenged to capture a landscape or subject with a day-to-night (or vice-versa) timelapse?

Polaris helps photographers conveniently frame the perfect shooting angle with ease. If you are a lover of landscape and nature photography, or even astrophotography - Polaris can make your shooting efficient and uncomplicated. In addition, Polaris can automatically render photos that normally required computer processing, such as panoramic photos, time-lapses, exposure bracketing, and so on. By introducing Polaris to the world, we hope to dismantle the technical boundaries traditional photographic tripods currently face to a more progressive and intelligent stage.             Every notable landmark seems to have one thing in common: tourists, and lots of them!Removing tourists or any unwanted moving objects from a photo used to be incredibly slow and tedious work. With the Scene Retouching feature built into Polaris, all you have to do is to take several shots of the same scene, and Polaris will automatically remove tourists or unwanted objects from photos and finally generate a clean photo as if they were never there    Polaris makes setting up for starry sky shooting quick and easy. Normally, a long-exposure is needed to capture the brightness of stars, even on the clearest of nights. However, due to the rotation of the earth, the stars in pictures often show tailing or streaks. Before Polaris, the equatorial mount was typically used by photographers, knowing it could not rotate freely and severely limiting composition in hopes of getting a clearer image.  When capturing the night sky – Polaris uses the built-in GPS, compass, and astromaps to move the head precisely to prevent tailing or streaks. This feature will allow you to capture perfect shots of the Milky Way or your favorite constellations. Using the built-in features you can also adjust your shooting angle at will.  We know that most stars are very hard to spot with the naked eye, and even harder to spot when looking through a camera viewfinder. To help frame your shot - the Polaris app uses Astro maps, AI, and the sensors in your mobile phone to make framing a breeze. Just point your phone at the sky. Move it around to see every star your camera could capture. Once you see the shot – press the shutter button – Polaris will automatically rotate and begin capturing the area your phone was framing.  How does Polaris track stars?> No Traditional Polar Alignment Needed.​Polaris has a built-in GPS, an accelerometer, and an electric compass. By using these in concert Polaris can get its latitude, longitude, and orientation data. With this data, the processor inside Polaris can calculate the rotation of the polar axis. This means there is no need to do a polar axis calibration - which is a critical and time-consuming step when using traditional equatorial mounts. > Calculation And Auto TrackingIn order to enable Polaris to trace stars, we designed more inside, not only just those sensors.Even exposures as short as 20 seconds can cause the final image to be blurry due to a mix of the earth’s rotation and the magnification effect of the camera lens. Since the rotation angle of the earth in 20 seconds is relatively small - the electric compass and GPS aren’t able to necessarily determine the change. In order to properly trace the stars and prevent streaks - a high-precision hall angular sensor inside Polaris, together with a reduction gearbox structure, can reach an extreme control precision of up to 0.01˚ (36 arc seconds) - which is equal to the amount the earth rotates in 2.5 seconds. This means that we can capture the stars with a longer exposure, and can get the same result as you would get with a 2.5-second exposure. Your shots will be clear, sharp, and leave out the blurry star trails. >Increased Tracking AccuracyAfter additional verification - the tracking accuracy of Polaris is able to be increased by four times. That is 0.0025 ° (9 arc seconds). This is achieved by increasing the deceleration ratio of the transmission structure. we have added a visual correction function to Polaris. When you use Polaris for long exposure deep-sky shooting, Polaris will take a set of photos, each of which is a long exposure. After each photo is taken, Polaris will recognize the precise position of each star in the frame and correct for the movement/direction of the camera. This helps to avoid shooting for tens of minutes or having to continually reset positioning and restarting shots for hours. After the shooting is complete - Polaris will align and stack the photos captured to create an ultra-long exposure photo.  Being challenged to capture a landscape or subject with a day-to-night (or vice-versa) timelapse? Instead of sitting next to your camera all evening checking and adjusting exposure, and then carefully adjusting and tweaking exposure in a post-production studio for hours - use the built-in ""Holy Grail"" mode. ""Holy Grail"" tackles this extremely technical and time-consuming scenario by automatically analyzing every photo and adjusting the exposure between every shot. Your camera can easily get perfectly exposed and smooth transitions without any manual work. Use Polaris to make your day-to-night timelapse standout!   When shooting a sunrise or sunset, photographers need to choose the most suitable shooting location and angle for the best composition, but sometimes the search takes too long. In conjunction with the mobile app, Polaris can simulate the sun's movement, and you can compose the picture before the sun has risen or is close to being set. The composition is simulated by using the mobile phone’s accelerometer, camera, and AI. You only need to select where you want the Sun framed above the horizon and send it to Polaris. Polaris will take photos at the exact time the sun hits that desired angle.     Polaris uses your camera’s autofocus abilities to the max. The smart controller can take a set of photos with different focal points, and using the AI can synthesize these into photos without blur. This means that every photo will have perfect focus throughout the image, and you can get creative with it or choose your optimal focal point later.    Both RAW and HDR files are designed to preserve details, but these technologies sometimes fail to meet requirements during long exposures. Polaris will review each photo after an exposure is complete, and adjust the camera parameters if needed. If the photo is partially overexposed or underexposed – Polaris will shoot until every part of the image is properly exposed, synthesizing one perfect picture for you!    Multi Exposing & Auto StackingLet the camera automatically take multiple shots and then auto stack them to compose a bright and sharp night scene.    Timelapse photography is one of the more eye-catching shots to integrate into a video, and they help immensely in storytelling. Polaris uses the smartphone app to make setting up the interval between shots, duration, and exposure easy. Polaris can even adjust the timelapse settings during capture to ensure that the timelapse comes out exactly as you hoped it would.  Dynamic TimelapsePolaris allows you to bring even more creativity into your timelapse photography. Thanks to the built-in programming functions, everything about your camera is controllable. Use this expanded ability to record timelapse videos with dynamic changes in the direction of view and speed. At the same time – dial in your ISO, aperture, shutter speed, and even your focal length from anywhere.During the capture of time-lapses, you can freely set the key frames of a timelapse video to highlight the subject by changing the ramping up or slowing down speed.Polaris also has an exposure smoothing function. This avoids overexposed or underexposed scenes when shooting time-lapse videos in manual mode. This function also avoids jitters in the brightness of timelapse videos due to exposure changes over time. 

 
  Before Polaris, you’d need to take multiple photos by continuously turning the camera manually, unload the SD card, and then import the photos into the computer to load onto a stitching program. When shooting a large number of photos for a high-resolution panorama, this can be a heavy and time-consuming task. Plus, you won’t know the outcome of the pano until running them through the program. With the help of Polaris, automatic panoramic shooting can be realized and reviewed in near real-time. After the automatic shooting is completed, the stitched pano can be checked through the app on your phone. Customize Your PanoramaPolaris supports automatic multi-line panoramic photo shooting, you can choose the number of rows and columns of the photo - everything else is done automatically. This mode also supports enhanced exposure. Polaris can take multiple exposures of each section of the panorama to avoid under or overexposure in any section of the synthetic panorama.     Polaris is more than just an electric tripod head or camera controller. Taking these concepts to the next-level, Polaris takes the rotation capabilities of geared heads and combines them with AI and the ability to remotely control and program shooting parameters. What does this mean? It means that movements can be preprogrammed, camera settings can be tuned and dialed-in during rotation to get the perfect shot, and AI can change exposure while capturing a full-day motion timelapse to make sure nothing is blown out. This not only brings convenience, but it can reduce your workload while trying to capture the ideal shot. What used to be complicated shots are now made much simpler thanks to Polaris.  Within the app, we have worked to make setting up the exact shot you want to capture quick and hassle-free. We did this by introducing an easy-to-use graphic interface with adjustable controls. Through this interface, you can add custom control nodes. Each control node can individually set the parameters of the camera, the time interval between each shot, and the precise angle of the camera, or the rotation speed of the head. By making setup stress-free, we put no limits on where your inspiration can take you.      With Polaris, there is no need to be near the camera all the time. You can shoot the sunrise and sunset while staying warm in your car , and you can sit on your sofa and capture images of the starry sky. There are two versions of Polaris. One version has integrated Wi-Fi remote control. The other adds cellular capabilities to extend your control distance to any place within network coverage.  The supported frequency bands of Polaris Cellular version:    Every photographer wants to see their creation the second that shooting is completed. With Polaris’s wireless connection and app, you can transfer files right to your phone for preview and inspection without a card reader and computer. You can even process and send these shots to your favorite social platforms.     Polaris can remotely send images after they’re captured – you’ll even get a notification after the shot is complete.     Since Polaris is mainly comprised of aluminum alloy and stainless steel, its ensured to work in even the harshest environments. Adding to this, Polaris has also rated to IPX6 water-resistant performance, allowing the head to work even in torrential downpours.    Polaris Astro Expansion KitThrough its modular design, Polaris takes into account the needs of different scenarios while maintaining portability.

Back us on IndieGoGoand save big on DMX lighting technology! TEKE was created by a team of passionate filmmakers, engineers, installation artists and friends who’ve worked on projects for the Ridley Scott Creative Group, VICE, Samsung and Unity.TEKE started as a side project to create animated lighting for our video productions—but once we showed other artists our unique brand of lighting (and the clients we were getting), we were convinced to share it with the world.    Getting TEKE from idea to reality to a real product has been a tremendous team effort. We’ve worked on it full-time for more than a year. Our team includes an electrical engineer specializing in device design, a brilliant user-interface designer, and artists that have worked and researched across industries to develop the most versatile system possible.TEKE is now ready for production, and we’re so excited to share what we’ve built with the IndieGoGo community. 
Why IndieGoGo?We’re launching on IndieGoGo for the freedom to work closely with backers: understanding and learning what they really want out of a product. We've spent years collaborating with talented industry professionals, making a tool that is powerful, easy to use and truly affordable.We’ve been working on TEKE for over three years and now we need your support—to manufacture it at scale and share it with as many people as possible.Be one of the first to harness the power of TEKE’s beautiful and affordable DMX lighting. Thank you for backing us and bringing TEKE to the world. Manufacturing & Production We've reached our goal of being mass manufacturing ready, and we are now ordering materials for our first mass manufacturing run.Our hardware and firmware has passed all initial integrations and performance testing. We anticipate delivery to start mid-summer and will be able to keep up with future demand. In partnership with suppliers in China for chips, the TEKE case is also being injection molded in Canada, with assembly happening locally too. All packaging is aiming to be recyclable. Ordering, Shipping and TaxesIf you don't see an exact order you want, simply send us a message and well try our best to make a custom order for you. Multiple items can be ordered by simple doubling or tripling the pledge amount, our team will recognize it as a multiple order of the item.All orders can be updated / upgraded after the campaign ends - including all extras! We plan on charging shipping and taxes shortly before TEKE ships. This way we have time to negotiate the best price for wherever you are in the world. Shortly before we send your TEKE, a team member will get in touch to confirm the following details:
Address confirmation
Shipping and tax rate
Your interest in additional accessories or TEKE products
Upgrades or changes to order
We plan on making use of existing relationships with local shipping warehouses to make sure your order is delivered quickly with no hassle. Taxes will also vary based on where you're from. We collect tax before shipping, so please check out the breakdown of taxes for the following countries:
- Canada: Provincial sales taxes apply
- United States: State sales taxes apply
- Other countries: We are not charging taxes but you may be responsible for sales tax, VAT/GST taxes, duties, import fees, or other taxes/fees when your reward is delivered.

In a transitioning era from 4G to 5G, most platforms are unable to support 4K live streaming. However, when in 5G, even in outdoors without WIFI service, people can easily do 4K and 1080P live streaming. So this is a cutting-edge product that you shouldn’t miss in the coming 5G era. With the NANO, your 4K VR180 3D Videos and Still Frames look like you’re re-living what you’re watching.

It also allows you to emphasize differences in sizes or distances between objects, playing with elements to create even more spectacular effects.    As the thinnest VR180 Camera Device, we aim to bring extreme portability and convenience to cellphone VR and 3D shooting. The portability of NANO makes it irresistible to record or live stream what you see, feel and listen.If using it with a drone, the 4K VR180 3D video captured from Nano will WOW your friends!  The NANO can be used as a stand-alone 4K VR180 3D Camera, with its built-in battery with a powerful autonomy. Also with Sony’s CMOS sensor, the camera definition and battery life are improved, high-sensitivity, low power consumption, no smear, excellent anti-blooming characteristics, making it better than ever.        While NANO always delivers a powerful and stunning simultaneous 3D video matching, it has perfect way to dissipate heat. After all, its shell is built with aerial-class aluminum and its construction uses a CNC manufacturing technique paired with diamond cut chamfering design.

<p>Then it was time to develop the shutter unit - we decided that automatic exposure with the ability to select your preferred aperture gave the photographer the greatest ability to achieve creative results in all light levels, while still ensuring well-exposed photos and ease of use for beginners.</p>
<p>After the technical solutions and components were chosen and the electronic design was developed, prototypes of printed-circuit boards were manufactured, and the firmware for the flash was developed by our engineering team, comprising Andrey and Alexey.</p>

<h3>Our Vision:</h3>
<p>Our vision is to create exciting, fun to use cameras that feature striking design and offer creative photographic features not included in other affordable instant cameras.</p>
<p>Our first camera, the cardboard constructed Jollylook Instant Camera did exactly that. However, over the course of its development and production, we experienced many issues, from problems with parts delivery from suppliers, material choice and reliability and critically, poor manufacturing quality control by our selected Chinese manufacturing partner.</p>
<p>These issues resulted in us having to invest our personal savings and borrow further funds to continue to meet our obligations to backers. Production was moved from China to Ukraine, and a new manufacturing and assembly facility was created. The design of the Jollylook was improved to enhance reliability and employees were sourced and trained to assemble the new, improved Jollylook. Production of the new Ukrainian made cardboard Jollylook commenced in late January 2019.</p>
<p>We learned significant lessons from the development of the first Jollylook, and have taken all of those lessons and incorporated them into the way we designed the Jollylook Auto. We have identified the best materials, suppliers of key parts, glues, assembly techniques and more, and have extensive experience with all of these materials and suppliers from making the original Jollylook. We are better placed today than at any previous time to bring the Jollylook Auto to fruition successfully, ensuring that these lessons learned at significant cost will assist us to fulfill all our obligations to backers of the Jollylook Auto in a timely manner.</p>

Rewards and shipping cost estimates: 

All shipping will be from made from Ukraine.
The idea:
We are in love with the look of vintage film cameras, and we are passionate about the concept of creating a stylish camera with a steampunk-inspired vintage design, while still being functional so that even an inexperienced user can easily get great results.
Combining classic design, environmentally friendly materials for the camera body, a manual development mechanism and modern functional electronics, we have created a design that we are sure will impress even the most demanding of users.
How does it work?
Insert a Fujifilm Instax mini film cassette:
Set the focus distance using the easy to read focus scale:  Choose the aperture to creatively achieve the depth of field you desire (f/16, f/22; f/32; f/45; f/64; pinhole) 

Open the viewfinder: Charge the flash: Look through the viewfinder: Take a photo!  Develop the photo by turning the crank:  After a few minutes, you will have a unique instant photo in your hands Jollylook Auto Mini uses Fujifilm “Instax mini” instant film cassettes which are readily available worldwide. 

Jollylook Auto Square uses Fujifilm “Instax Square” instant film cassettes which are readily available worldwide. 

The advantages of Jollylook Auto:
Vintage Design – The classic vintage-inspired design is striking and attracts attention from all who see it.
Automatic - Auto exposure and flash make it easy to shoot and achieve great results.
Precise focus control - Unlike most instant cameras, Jollylook Auto features precise manual focus control for sharper results at all distances.
Foldout and Compact - Little bigger than a smartphone box, the Jollylook Auto fits into a jacket pocket or small bag with ease.
Easy to use – With easy to follow instructions the Jollylook Auto can be used immediately and instantly.
A striking display camera - Even when not in use the Jollylook Auto looks beautiful on the shelf!
Fun to use - Jollylook Auto is a fun and interesting camera to use that teaches you more about photography while impressing your friends and creating amazing instant memories.
Beautiful photos – Using Instax mini film you get 10 instant color or monochrome analog photos. Instax is the most reliable, affordable and long-lasting instant film available. 
Environmentally-friendly – The case of the Jollylook Auto is made from easily recyclable, biodegradable laminated wood fiber material.

The creation of Jollylook Auto: 
We created many designs of the Jollylook Auto camera... Until we achieved a final design that features a harmonious combination of shape and function that was easy to use, reliable and sturdy while retaining the vintage steampunk aesthetic we desired.


Of course, for every test, we had to build a computer model and program the laser cutting machine, which was brilliantly managed by Artyom, our design and laser cutting specialist.

Finally, we had a large-scale prototype ready.

Then it was time to develop the shutter unit - we decided that automatic exposure with the ability to select your preferred aperture gave the photographer the greatest ability to achieve creative results in all light levels, while still ensuring well-exposed photos and ease of use for beginners.
After the technical solutions and components were chosen and the electronic design was developed, prototypes of printed-circuit boards were manufactured, and the firmware for the flash was developed by our engineering team, comprising Andrey and Alexey.

The second iteration of the board and the fifth iteration of the firmware suited us. We printed prototypes of the body and plastic parts of the shutter unit on a 3D printer.

This process included many changes and improvements, and it was necessary to change the logic of the camera control and status indication and to make subtle design changes to facilitate ease of use and reliability. 

Also at the prototype stage, the problem of material selection was solved. We had originally planned to use lightweight plywood, but the complexity of processing and the need to use lacquers, solvents, and grinding added cost and risk that we chose not to take to ensure a more affordable product and fewer potential delays in manufacture.
The wood-fiber material selected for the Jollylook Auto contains less glue than plywood and does not contain formaldehyde at all, features a surface that does not require additional processing, looks magnificent, and is easily able to be manufactured on our in-house laser cutter. The final finish has been further improved by laser cutting techniques used by Artyom which create a very attractive look to the cuts and enhances the overall appearance of the camera. The development unit was developed by us for the original cardboard Jollylook camera and has been proven to be a sturdy and reliable unit. Finally, 14 months after the development of the original concept, we're here looking for your support to bring this amazing and beautiful camera to life!

And we're beyond excited to finally share it with youWe love to travel light. But we also love the creative freedom a tripod offers. Steady shots, long exposures, self timers... This seemingly impossible combination was the spark that gave birth to the Conda strap™.  The Conda strap™ is the love-child between a camera strap and a tripodIn it's loose state the Conda strap™ is flexible like a normal strap, having all the qualities you would expect from a great camera strap ( and more, but let's talk about that later ). When the lever is engaged the strap stiffens, opening up a world of possibilities. There is literally no end to where or how you can use the Conda strap™. Use it in Tripod mode or wrap it around a tree, pole or fence and get steady shots anywhere.This might just be the Vloggers best friend. The Conda strap™ transforms into the ultimate selfie sticks, video rig or tripod for any surface. Do everything, without having to bring anything.Switching between different carrying modes with ease is key for a great camera strap. We've integrated a bunch of smart features to ensure that you can hop between neck, sling and shoulder mode in no time.Adjusting the length is simple and done in no time. The Conda strap™ comes in two different versions, Standard and Plus. The Plus version is recommended for heavier cameras and the Standard version is suitable for lighter cameras such as compacts, mirrorless and lighter DSLR's.Not only did we set out to create a whole new category of camera equipment. We made damn sure we made the best camera strap. Period.Three levels of stiffnessThe patent pending technology behind the Conda strap™ allows the lever to be operated between three different states. 'Loose' is just what it sounds like, loose like a normal camera strap. The 'Semi' state allows you to manually shape the strap into the desired configuration. And once you got the framing in place, switch the lever to 'Stiff' and the strap locks into position. SeparableThe quick release enables you to wrap the Conda strap™ around a pole, tree or whatever you can think of. Simply press the two safety clasps and split the housing in two. Pretty damn cool.Legendary length adjustment Probably the fastest length adjustment you've ever seen. Slide down the locking wedge, slide the strap to the desired length and lock it in place by sliding the locking wedge back into place. Makes it easy to switch between neck or sling style when you're on the go.Dampened and padded for extreme comfortThe Conda strap™ is dampened which means it smooths out the forces generated from walking with your camera, giving you a more comfy ride. Game changer.Smooth or grippyThe Smooth side has a low friction surface ideal when using the strap in sling mode and the grippy side keeps the strap in place when hanging the camera over the shoulder.Tool-less installationBye bye, hex keys (In case you haven't lost them already). Should you need to tighten the camera screw more than your fingers can handle, simply use a coin. The Conda Strap™ has a female 1/4-20 thread at the bottom so you can attach it to rigs, extra plates etc.Relentless engineeringWe take safety serious and the Conda strap™ is designed for loads up to 75 kg (165 lbs). We know that cheaping out on materials never pays off. You won't find anything else than stainless steel or anodized 6061 aluminium in the metal components and the housing is made from super strong fiber filled Nylon. The joints are made from a custom manufactured polymer with unique properties that gives the Conda strap™ it's locking power and stiffness.Adjustable tensionShould you ever need to adjust the holding strength, we got you covered. The tension mechanism is neatly hidden inside the neck strap in case you need it.Simply twist the end caps if you ever need to adjust the holding powerThe Conda strap™ will be available in three different color combinations, Black, Titanium and Ruby. Black on Black. The matte logo reflects beautifully in contrast to the dark, shimmering strap.The Titanium gray is discreet but has a bit more contrast between the dark logo and the sleeve compared to the black version.The Ruby red is a radiant option featuring a contrasting logo and a dark, red sleeve. The final production version swimming in a sea of it's predecessorsIt's been a long journey to get to where we are today. The idea behind the Conda strap™ emerged when we asked some of our customers back in 2017 what problems they faced when they are out shooting.

<p></p>
<p>Double Cross Leather Camera Strap is fully functional and adjustable. It features a durable non slip construction that uses all eco-friendly materials.</p><p></p><ul>
<li>The comfortable neck strap with <b>non-slip wool felt</b> has a <b>width of 4cm (1.6inch).</b>
</li>
<li>The strap assembly includes 4 metal screws with a diameter of 1,1cm (0.44inch). Every package includes <b>black and nickel-colored metal screws</b>, so that you can choose, which color you prefer. The package also includes a <b>spare screw</b> for each color and a small <b>ring for fastening the screws</b> – all you need for assembly and dis-assembly.</li>
<li>The <b>length can be adjusted</b> from 90cm – 128cm (35.4inch – 51.1inch) by shifting the inner straps in or out of the outer strap and fixing them by flat screws.</li>
</ul><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1335472/files/20150329043130-for_everyone.jpg?1427628690"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The strap <b>fits most analog and digital cameras</b> and can be attached both with or without the metal split rings. To use the strap without split rings, you can unscrew the mechanism that is holding the ring, remove the ring, attach the end-straps directly to the camera and re-assemble the ends with the screws. Always make sure that the screws are tightened well.</p><p><b>Using the flat screw system, the design doesn’t include any metal buckles that can cause discomfort or even camera scratching.</b> This way, we use minimum metal parts and make the strap as simple and flat as possible.</p><ul>
<li>The beauty of this product lies in well chosen quality materials. The <b>oil-tanned leather offers superb durability</b>, resistant to everyday wear and tear, while still being soft to the touch. The <b>wool felt keeps the strap in place</b> and minimize the risk of slipping from your shoulder.</li>
<li>
<b>Personalize your strap by choosing the color</b> of leather, color of the felt and color of the top stitch on the outer neck strap. This gives you <b>80 possible color variations</b> you can choose from. For more information, you can check out our Colorpicker at <a href=""http://www.doublecrossleather.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.doublecrossleather.com</a>.</li>

</div>","Hi everybody! Thanks for checking out our product. It has been 5 months since we started designing this strap and finally, we have the perfect prototype. After countless hours of hard work, we are ready to put it in your hands. Now is the time when we need your help. Please, spread the word.
We are grateful for the opportunity to share our Leather Camera Strap with the Indiegogo community!
Do not hesitate and get yourself a camera strap you will love.
Why do I need the Leather Camera Strap?


Style is your life and fashion is your passion. Your look needs to be in perfect color harmony.
You want to have the coolest strap in your photographic community.
You want the best for your camera... ultimate quality natural materials and perfect functionality.
You love leather. 
About The Strap

Double Cross Leather Camera Strap is fully functional and adjustable. It features a durable non slip construction that uses all eco-friendly materials.
The comfortable neck strap with non-slip wool felt has a width of 4cm (1.6inch).

The strap assembly includes 4 metal screws with a diameter of 1,1cm (0.44inch). Every package includes black and nickel-colored metal screws, so that you can choose, which color you prefer. The package also includes a spare screw for each color and a small ring for fastening the screws – all you need for assembly and dis-assembly.
The length can be adjusted from 90cm – 128cm (35.4inch – 51.1inch) by shifting the inner straps in or out of the outer strap and fixing them by flat screws.
The strap fits most analog and digital cameras and can be attached both with or without the metal split rings. To use the strap without split rings, you can unscrew the mechanism that is holding the ring, remove the ring, attach the end-straps directly to the camera and re-assemble the ends with the screws. Always make sure that the screws are tightened well.Using the flat screw system, the design doesn’t include any metal buckles that can cause discomfort or even camera scratching. This way, we use minimum metal parts and make the strap as simple and flat as possible.
The beauty of this product lies in well chosen quality materials. The oil-tanned leather offers superb durability, resistant to everyday wear and tear, while still being soft to the touch. The wool felt keeps the strap in place and minimize the risk of slipping from your shoulder.

Personalize your strap by choosing the color of leather, color of the felt and color of the top stitch on the outer neck strap. This gives you 80 possible color variations you can choose from. For more information, you can check out our Colorpicker at www.doublecrossleather.com.
The strap is handmade by skilled craftsmen in Slovakia (European Union) and proudly marked with our brand, which comes from the Slovak national symbol.
Adjusting lenght is easy:Ring for fastening screws is included. You don't have to look for a screwdriver:Choose Your Color Combination
That strap is nice, but what if my favorite color is blue? With Double Cross Leather, you can have the choice! Feel free to pick between 80 of unique color combinations. Choose pure elegance of classic natural look or stand out from the crowd using wilder color combinations that better suit your look.

<h3><strong>Dead Silent</strong></h3>
<p>Sixteen-Year-old Aaron is forced to comes to terms with watching the world around him fall apart, when blood is mixed with tragedy, and your home becomes infested by the dead, surviving a zombie outbreak isn’t easy on your own, especially when you’re a deaf mute.</p>
<h3><strong>About the film</strong></h3>
<p>Hi my name is Lewis Clements, I am the writer and producer for 'Dead Silent' and I am currently studying Creative Media Production in the West Midlands. I have been a passionate fan of the zombie genre ever since I was a young boy, when I first saw George Romero's 1978 'Dawn of the Dead', but it has taken some creative juices to come up with an original idea in such a crowded genre. </p>

<h3>How our budget is spent</h3>
<p>There has been a lot of planning put into making our budget work, we are aware that it is a small budget and we wanted to produce a short film on a tight scale to prove it can be done. our budget will be spent on the following:</p>
<p>Location Fee's - Getting the right location is crucial to us, although based in a residential area it is key to focus on getting the right feel for our film which the house will have a good control over. Alongside the actual location we will have to get props which will be a minimal addition to the location budget spend.</p>
<p>Zombie Prosthetic Effects - Our film is dependant on our characters looking right, our zombies have to be real and this is an area we cant cheap out on. </p>
<p>Professional Crew members - This is a professional short film, we are giving students and amateurs the opportunity to work alongside industry professionals on our set giving experience to all. We understand how hard it can be for passionate individuals lacking experience to break out and we hope that our short film can facilitate their skills.</p>
<p>They will be the biggest 3 focuses of our budget, additions on the left over budget will include travel and food for all our staff over the 3 production days.</p>

Sixteen-Year-old Aaron is forced to comes to terms with watching the world around him fall apart, when blood is mixed with tragedy, and your home becomes infested by the dead, surviving a zombie outbreak isn’t easy on your own, especially when you’re a deaf mute.
About the film
Hi my name is Lewis Clements, I am the writer and producer for 'Dead Silent' and I am currently studying Creative Media Production in the West Midlands. I have been a passionate fan of the zombie genre ever since I was a young boy, when I first saw George Romero's 1978 'Dawn of the Dead', but it has taken some creative juices to come up with an original idea in such a crowded genre. 
I believe that 'Dead Silent' is a complete fresh concept, the idea that a boy with a disability whom has the world on his shoulders, but still manage's to show as much courage and spirit as any other human being would; equality is the main objective here. It's a fun idea that is ambitious in scope, yet contained in terms of location, making it achievable on a low budget.
To achieve success this film needs convincing make-up, good costumes and good set dressing. There are no shadows in which to hide the zombies, if the make up or gore effects are cheap, the film will fail in its ambition to be the best zombie short.
This Film means so much to me, it is something I have always loved and I have the chance to really make an impression and make a name for us. Any assistance in this would be hugely appreciated to help us reach this goal.

</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">My name is Julia Kulon, I am currently a senior at St. John’s College majoring in philosophy.</p>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">I first picked up a camera when I was twelve years old. Before that, I had been infatuated with creating little digital collages on Photoshop and dabbling in graphic design. I mostly taught myself skills by watching videos and reading manuals on the internet—mostly I would open Photoshop and click around, manipulating text and images as I pleased until I reached my desired effect. There came a point in my life where I was increasingly frustrated with relying on content that I found from the internet that the next logical step was to create my own. I received a Canon Rebel XS for Christmas and began to take pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The presence of the camera began to transcend all my boundaries in life. A sharp but increasingly growing hesitant young woman bogged down in hospitalizations and her own insecurities, the medium of photography registered to me as a language that I was comfortable using to maneuver the world. Having a camera allowed me to be a spectator and to participate in my surroundings even when I was too shy and hesitant. It became my suit of armor, my protector. Slowly I was able to start communicating and expressing myself more fully as an individual because I recognized that what I saw in the lens was valuable and a reflection of myself. What I saw in the viewfinder I liked, so I began to want to share it with people who would become my friends. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446179707/fcyqevezc0a1hate38gh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><blockquote style=""text-align: justify;"">Marguerite, 2015.  © Julia Kulon</blockquote><p style=""text-align: justify;"">I never really fully consciously considered the camera’s influence on my life until I shot a wedding last year where the bride had a younger brother who was also incredibly shy and faced with his own disability. The bride pulled me aside before the wedding and asked if I could cast aside my ‘no other camera’ rule. She told me:</p><blockquote style=""text-align: justify;"">“The camera allows him to communicate with the world. This is the lens that allows him to bridge the gap between himself and the people around him.”</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">As I looked at him, I was overcome with a feeling of understanding and kinship to this man that I barely knew and at the same time knew all too well. This is what photography has been for me a “lens that allows [one] to bridge the gap between [oneself] and the people around [oneself].” </p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446179811/rgwiymcpbkqinmbgm7h3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><blockquote style=""text-align: justify;"">Lola, 2015.  © Julia Kulon</blockquote><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Over the course of the last two years, I have been incredibly lucky to be surrounded by friends and family who would push me every time I faltered in my own self-confidence when it came to creating images of the beauty that I saw. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">With their help, I finally came to persuading myself to try a hand at portrait photography, having mostly photographed nature and architecture.</p>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Now for anyone who knows a thing about portrait photography, they know it’s incredibly hard.  You have to develop a relationship with your subject in order to cultivate a feeling of comfort and intimacy. By all accounts, it is a reciprocal relationship. If it isn’t, the photographs are rarely successful. They lack vitality and honesty.</p>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Although very scary, somewhere in that place of comfort a lot of magic happens. I am still learning the ropes of this process which has allowed me to become more assertive with my voice and my vision, and moreover the process has taught me so much about connection—what it truly means for a human being to be a human being with another human being. That statement is one that I’m still trying to figure out. At the moment, I am extremely motivated and captivated by attempting to capture people’s inner beauty in a externally geared medium. Substance over form. How do we capture that visually?</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446180331/hxmr4ernwndcdvwmx6za.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><blockquote style=""text-align: justify;"">Lola, 2015. © Julia Kulon</blockquote><h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">WHAT KIND OF INVESTMENTS HAVE YOU MADE?</h2><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Over the last year and a half, I have made a conscious effort to invest in my love for photography. After having a tearful goodbye with my beloved Canon Rebel XS that I have passed on to a dear friend of mine in hopes that the camera will continue to live on and bring inspiration and magic to her life, I bought a Canon EOS 7D Mark II Digital SLR Camera after working all summer at a product innovation firm. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I have also invested in an external hard drive, a state of the art quick-performing card driver, an Instax Polaroid Camera to begin pre-session documentation and purchased an Adobe Photography membership which I pay for every month. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I have been fortunate enough to be graced by true gifts. One family friend surprised with the beautiful gift, a Canon EF Lens 50 mm f/1.8 (all images pictured here shot on this lens). He warned me that the lens was a real hassle when it came to focusing, and he was ultimately right. For the first year, the lens was my pride and joy. The more I began to shoot, however, the more disgruntled I became with the lens and its limitations. I wanted more, and this time it made down to the restrictions of the equipment itself rather than my vision but a finicky lens became a true hinderance to my vision. Last Christmas, I was  fortunate enough to receive a Velbron DF 60, a lightweight, aluminum tripod, ideal for someone who is physically unable to lift extremely heavy things or carry them for a long time.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To the best of my ability, I have tried to provide myself with getting better equipment while being fortunate to have had many pleasant surprises come my way.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446180962/hnwrke2lriv1ufu5rsqs.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<blockquote style=""text-align: justify;"">Marriage and Civil Court, Chicago, IL, 2015.</blockquote><h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">WHAT NOW?</h2><p style=""text-align: justify;"">I am asking for money for a new lens, particularly a <b>Canon EF 35mm f/1.4L II USM AutoFocus Wide Angle Lens</b>. I hope it will become my prime lens to shoot with and that it will stick around with me for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">I am currently a student and I do not have the financial means to make this purchase myself. I work an on-campus job as the College’s darkroom manager and technician where I hope to guide and inspire other people’s journeys and beginning forays into black and white photography. While this has been such a rewarding experience, it simply does not offer any financial support other than support for essential necessities. </p>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Additionally, my handicap does pose some problems in this department. I am not able to stand for longer than ten to fifteen minutes without having my feet hurt and being fatigued. Having club feet, I am not able to stand fully on the balls of my feet so a lot of my body weight is supported by my toes as opposed to every part of my foot. This causes discomfort and directly correlates to lacking great bipedal locomotion that one would normally have. An average human being who has been standing for a long time has the ability to take that energy and recreate it into more kinetic energy—I do not. Diagnosed with curvature of the joints, my wrists are not able to hold flat things, e.g. dishes or serving plates for a long time. I find it extremely difficult to grasp anything that should be fundamentally perpendicular to my wrist bone. </p>
<p>
</p><p>These challenges have rendered me physically unable to to take the traditional routes of working in customer service or food industry, otherwise I would have utilized that route a long time ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">I have made investments to this passion of mine to the best extent that my life has allowed for me, but in order to take the next step in my journey, I’m ready to take on the next level in my own photographic journey, and for that I need your help.</p><h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?</h2><p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p>Your contributions will go to buying <b>Canon EF 35mm f/1.4L II USM AutoFocus Wide Angle Lens</b>; one year insurance is included in this price ($1,800) with additional tax and shipping costs. <b>Moreover, some money has been allotted for the printing of photographic prints, shipping and packaging costs as well as Indiegogo's 5% fee.</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any additional money that may be raised through this endeavor will go to a saving account and will be used to purchase more equipment in the future. I am planning in the future to create a website or possibly purchasing proper lighting equipment. </p><h2><b>WHAT ARE THE INITIATIVES?</b></h2><div>
<p>(<i>The following initiatives are valued at the assumption that not all packages or prints will be bought.</i>)</p>
<p>
</p>

</div></div>","Agnieszka, 2014 & Pietà (Maria and Marguerite), 2015. © Julia KulonWHO ARE YOU?
My name is Julia Kulon, I am currently a senior at St. John’s College majoring in philosophy.

I first picked up a camera when I was twelve years old. Before that, I had been infatuated with creating little digital collages on Photoshop and dabbling in graphic design. I mostly taught myself skills by watching videos and reading manuals on the internet—mostly I would open Photoshop and click around, manipulating text and images as I pleased until I reached my desired effect. There came a point in my life where I was increasingly frustrated with relying on content that I found from the internet that the next logical step was to create my own. I received a Canon Rebel XS for Christmas and began to take pictures.

The presence of the camera began to transcend all my boundaries in life. A sharp but increasingly growing hesitant young woman bogged down in hospitalizations and her own insecurities, the medium of photography registered to me as a language that I was comfortable using to maneuver the world. Having a camera allowed me to be a spectator and to participate in my surroundings even when I was too shy and hesitant. It became my suit of armor, my protector. Slowly I was able to start communicating and expressing myself more fully as an individual because I recognized that what I saw in the lens was valuable and a reflection of myself. What I saw in the viewfinder I liked, so I began to want to share it with people who would become my friends. 

Marguerite, 2015.  © Julia KulonI never really fully consciously considered the camera’s influence on my life until I shot a wedding last year where the bride had a younger brother who was also incredibly shy and faced with his own disability. The bride pulled me aside before the wedding and asked if I could cast aside my ‘no other camera’ rule. She told me:“The camera allows him to communicate with the world. This is the lens that allows him to bridge the gap between himself and the people around him.”

As I looked at him, I was overcome with a feeling of understanding and kinship to this man that I barely knew and at the same time knew all too well. This is what photography has been for me a “lens that allows [one] to bridge the gap between [oneself] and the people around [oneself].” 

Lola, 2015.  © Julia KulonOver the course of the last two years, I have been incredibly lucky to be surrounded by friends and family who would push me every time I faltered in my own self-confidence when it came to creating images of the beauty that I saw. 
With their help, I finally came to persuading myself to try a hand at portrait photography, having mostly photographed nature and architecture.

Now for anyone who knows a thing about portrait photography, they know it’s incredibly hard.  You have to develop a relationship with your subject in order to cultivate a feeling of comfort and intimacy. By all accounts, it is a reciprocal relationship. If it isn’t, the photographs are rarely successful. They lack vitality and honesty.

 Although very scary, somewhere in that place of comfort a lot of magic happens. I am still learning the ropes of this process which has allowed me to become more assertive with my voice and my vision, and moreover the process has taught me so much about connection—what it truly means for a human being to be a human being with another human being. That statement is one that I’m still trying to figure out. At the moment, I am extremely motivated and captivated by attempting to capture people’s inner beauty in a externally geared medium. Substance over form. How do we capture that visually?

Lola, 2015. © Julia KulonWHAT KIND OF INVESTMENTS HAVE YOU MADE?
Over the last year and a half, I have made a conscious effort to invest in my love for photography. After having a tearful goodbye with my beloved Canon Rebel XS that I have passed on to a dear friend of mine in hopes that the camera will continue to live on and bring inspiration and magic to her life, I bought a Canon EOS 7D Mark II Digital SLR Camera after working all summer at a product innovation firm. 


I have also invested in an external hard drive, a state of the art quick-performing card driver, an Instax Polaroid Camera to begin pre-session documentation and purchased an Adobe Photography membership which I pay for every month. 


I have been fortunate enough to be graced by true gifts. One family friend surprised with the beautiful gift, a Canon EF Lens 50 mm f/1.8 (all images pictured here shot on this lens). He warned me that the lens was a real hassle when it came to focusing, and he was ultimately right. For the first year, the lens was my pride and joy. The more I began to shoot, however, the more disgruntled I became with the lens and its limitations. I wanted more, and this time it made down to the restrictions of the equipment itself rather than my vision but a finicky lens became a true hinderance to my vision. Last Christmas, I was  fortunate enough to receive a Velbron DF 60, a lightweight, aluminum tripod, ideal for someone who is physically unable to lift extremely heavy things or carry them for a long time.


To the best of my ability, I have tried to provide myself with getting better equipment while being fortunate to have had many pleasant surprises come my way.



Marriage and Civil Court, Chicago, IL, 2015.WHAT NOW?I am asking for money for a new lens, particularly a Canon EF 35mm f/1.4L II USM AutoFocus Wide Angle Lens. I hope it will become my prime lens to shoot with and that it will stick around with me for a very, very long time.

I am currently a student and I do not have the financial means to make this purchase myself. I work an on-campus job as the College’s darkroom manager and technician where I hope to guide and inspire other people’s journeys and beginning forays into black and white photography. While this has been such a rewarding experience, it simply does not offer any financial support other than support for essential necessities. 

Additionally, my handicap does pose some problems in this department. I am not able to stand for longer than ten to fifteen minutes without having my feet hurt and being fatigued. Having club feet, I am not able to stand fully on the balls of my feet so a lot of my body weight is supported by my toes as opposed to every part of my foot. This causes discomfort and directly correlates to lacking great bipedal locomotion that one would normally have. An average human being who has been standing for a long time has the ability to take that energy and recreate it into more kinetic energy—I do not. Diagnosed with curvature of the joints, my wrists are not able to hold flat things, e.g. dishes or serving plates for a long time. I find it extremely difficult to grasp anything that should be fundamentally perpendicular to my wrist bone. 

These challenges have rendered me physically unable to to take the traditional routes of working in customer service or food industry, otherwise I would have utilized that route a long time ago.

I have made investments to this passion of mine to the best extent that my life has allowed for me, but in order to take the next step in my journey, I’m ready to take on the next level in my own photographic journey, and for that I need your help.WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?
Your contributions will go to buying Canon EF 35mm f/1.4L II USM AutoFocus Wide Angle Lens; one year insurance is included in this price ($1,800) with additional tax and shipping costs. Moreover, some money has been allotted for the printing of photographic prints, shipping and packaging costs as well as Indiegogo's 5% fee.

Any additional money that may be raised through this endeavor will go to a saving account and will be used to purchase more equipment in the future. I am planning in the future to create a website or possibly purchasing proper lighting equipment. WHAT ARE THE INITIATIVES?
(The following initiatives are valued at the assumption that not all packages or prints will be bought.)


One will be providing photographic services for whatever needs are desired. This may be portraiture for your children, significant other, you yourself—anything that you would like to have proper documentation made of or would like to make an occasion out of.


For sponsors located in Warsaw, Poland, I will be in Warsaw from December 18, 2015 to January 11, 2016 tentatively.


For sponsors located in Chicago, Illinois, I will be in Chicago March 2016.


I am currently primarily located in Annapolis, Maryland. Such inquiries will be planned accordingly.


Packages include:





For donations of $150, you will receive two hours of shooting time and 10-15 edited images. (7 Packages)


For donations of $200, you will receive two to three hours of shooting time and 25-30 edited images. (7 Packages)


For donations of $300, you will receive three hours of shooting time and edited 30-40 images. (3 Packages)




Similarly, donations may also come in form of receiving fine photographic prints. I am offering prints of 5 images.





For $10, you will receive a postcard sized photograph (5"" x 7”) 


For $15, you will receive a standard letter sized photograph (8.5” by 11”) 


For $20, you will receive a standard poster sized photograph (11″ x 17″) 


Photographs include:









1. Untitled I, 2015 (from Flora series)

2. Untitled II, 2015 (from Flora series)


3. Untitled III, 2015 (from Flora series)


4. Untitled IV, 2015 (from The Sailboat)


5. For The Masses (Chicago From The River)
 All prints will be delivered in white manila envelopes with a sturdy cardboard casing to ensure that the prints will not be bent in the process of their being mailed.


Other donations of different values or similar (without the request of print or package) will be given a thank you email and will be included on the list of sponsors when I issue a thank you statement on my blog for all those who have made this dream possible.


Thank you for reading, and as always, thank you for your support in my endeavors. I can't express how much I appreciate it.

<p>Almost every Photographer wants to be able to show their best image / video on a high resolution large screen, Viewing scene from the camera's small screen is inconvenient and hard to see the details. Currently there are 2 ways to achieve a better review from the camera, both have their pros &amp; cons:</p>
<p>1) Field monitor : too bulky </p>
<p>2) App control : works only with certain models of camera, rely on wi-fi connection, has lags. </p>
<p>We believe there must be a better solution for this, so we designed HD900, <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">the first tablet in the market with HDMI input, provide the fastest way to check your work immediately. Right after you connect the camera and HD900 with HDMI cable, your work will display in our 9"" , 2560*1600 high resolution anti-glare screen.</span></p>
<p>Review your pictures / videos is much easier now, without sacrifice the image quality, or adding extra weight in your backpack.</p>

</div>","Almost every Photographer wants to be able to show their best image / video on a high resolution large screen, Viewing scene from the camera's small screen is inconvenient and hard to see the details. Currently there are 2 ways to achieve a better review from the camera, both have their pros & cons:
1) Field monitor : too bulky 
2) App control : works only with certain models of camera, rely on wi-fi connection, has lags. 
We believe there must be a better solution for this, so we designed HD900, the first tablet in the market with HDMI input, provide the fastest way to check your work immediately. Right after you connect the camera and HD900 with HDMI cable, your work will display in our 9"" , 2560*1600 high resolution anti-glare screen.
Review your pictures / videos is much easier now, without sacrifice the image quality, or adding extra weight in your backpack.







































                  HD900 is perfect display for PS, XBOX,Zotac zbox, Rasberry PI etc.
