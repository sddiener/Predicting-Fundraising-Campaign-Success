<p>It's been nearly 4 years since we starting recording our debut album <i>1994</i>, which would go on to make several top album lists of 2013 and be streamed/sold in over 30 different countries. Needlessly to say, we're absolutely proud of what its accomplished, considering that we had no help from any management group, label, or publicist - everything we did ourselves with the support of amazing fans.</p>
<p>Since then, we've learned a lot about what to do and what not to do. At the end of 2014, we decided maybe we should do what other bands were doing: release an EP and hire a publicist to help promote it - the result being our self-titled EP released in July 2015. Because of what little we could afford, we went with a smaller company in hopes that we could still get the impact we were wanting. This turned out to be a giant waste of money and time, as it virtually did nothing for us. </p>
<p>Point being - you pay for what you get!</p>
<p>We also felt that releasing a short EP as opposed to a full album naturally didn't generate as much excitement among our fans. Don't get us wrong, the love and support we have received from it has been great - all I'm saying is, we hear you.</p>
<p>So, after taking some time away from the group and allowing ourselves to be without it for awhile, we're coming back revitalized to make things right: record a brand new full-length album and include you all (our fans) in the process.</p>
<p>Every dollar contributed will not only go toward your rewards, but will also be key in partnering with big name industry insiders, producers, publicists, and promoters.</p>
<p>We know you want to see the band succeed, and you can help us make that possible.</p>

<p>Dearest friends, i am creating an album, a compilation of songs that have birthed out of deep love in me thinking about the future of my children and great grandchildren. </p>

<p>I know that there are so many causes, so many deserving places in need of contribution, and i am someone who donates to a lot of different things...  I had to sit with it for a while before i put a call out for support in a world filled with much need,  And yet when i dream't about the world i wanted for my children, i wanted there to be art in it, i wanted there to be a place for the creative process and the artistic visioning potential within our humanity to have a place in the world. i have always felt that there always needs to be a place for visionary art on this planet. Art and music in its nature reflects the creative force that lives inside of us as human beings. I want my great grand children to inherit a healthy planet, and i also want them to inherit a life that is full of love and spirit that is rooted in a relationship with all living beings, as a tool to build a relationship and connection and reminder to that inherent connection we all share. </p>
<p>Though i am not formally trained in music, i have been studying sound and the use of music in a very unique way for over 7 years now. Learning from masterful healers who have harnessed the power of sound and using ancient songs that have literally come from the earth to help aid the healing process. </p>
<p>I also am working alongside my husband who is a professional musician who majored in Jazz in university and has been teaching music for over 15 years.  As well as other talented guest musicians and vocalists who are supporting the project. </p>
<p>The album will also be sharing a few sound bites from an amazing native drumming group who are part of my family.  They carry a truly beautiful authentic and ceremonial energy as they support in local ceremonies, vision quests, and sundance  in the Eastern part of Canada. </p>
<p>The album is devoted to every woman who is seizing courage to follow her dreams and dream in and vision a new world for our futures. Every woman who is afraid and doing it anyway. And of course to the Great Mother.... Who is always with us, but who has been forgotten of for far too long. </p>
<p>It is also deeply devoted to my grandmothers and grandfathers, living and passed on, and the deep gratitude i feel to be alive and all those who walked before me to get me to this moment in time.  </p>
<p>The songs that we want to record are beautiful lyrical compisitions and Piano and Drum. They are powerful and potent, haunting and inspiring. </p>
<p>One song, is called water is life. And it is written for the water protectors at standing rock, and all the protectors and guardians of the water. Anthems for protests, environmental protection, and spiritual connection. </p>
<p>All songs have been offered to be used in all and every capacity to different environmental and activist organizations working towards the protection of our peoples and planet. </p>
<p>This campaign will help with the primary costs of the creation of the album. </p>
<p>Studio recording Costs ---5000</p>
<p>Mastering process  -- 2000$ </p>

I am ramping up to create my next music video to accompany the release of my long awaited single ""Gold."" Many of you may know me personally and other's have been keeping up with my work, I am happy to have you all in my life. With your continuous support, encouragement, and help, you allow me to go after what I love to do. The music industry is not easy, it is tough and very cutthroat. But, creation should be easy and fun and thus will continue to do what I do regardless of the outcome. If you find yourself in the position, any amount of support will help. If you are not able to contribute at this time, no worries, just subscribe to my channels and enjoy!! Thank you for being part of my world and lets get this party started!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need </h3> <p>I am looking to raise $3,200. All the funds will go directly to create the music video. The equipment rental, production crew, and location travel in itself will cost $1,500. That leaves me with $1,700 for costumes, make-up, dancers, food, actors, choreography, and rehearsal time. </p>
<p>To see it more clearly: 3 Dancers @ 200 for their rehearsal time and shoot date (and that is on the Omie-is-my-Homie rate) = 600 + Main actress (200) = 800. Now, costumes, including mine, say 8 costumes total for the dancers, myself, and the main actress, @ 60 bucks each = 480. Now I want to feed my people of course! :) Good thing we are all on a diet = 200 for food and beverages. Make up and hair stylists (2 @ 200 each) = 400. And there you have it, how the budget can easily just go. So your contribution will help tremendously on providing me with a beautiful opportunity, and also jobs for all those beautiful and talented people I the industry! </p>
<p></p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>

</div></div>","Short Summary Hey everybody! Thank you for taking a minute to look over my Indie GOGO crowdfunding campaign! I am ramping up to create my next music video to accompany the release of my long awaited single ""Gold."" Many of you may know me personally and other's have been keeping up with my work, I am happy to have you all in my life. With your continuous support, encouragement, and help, you allow me to go after what I love to do. The music industry is not easy, it is tough and very cutthroat. But, creation should be easy and fun and thus will continue to do what I do regardless of the outcome. If you find yourself in the position, any amount of support will help. If you are not able to contribute at this time, no worries, just subscribe to my channels and enjoy!! Thank you for being part of my world and lets get this party started!   What I Need  I am looking to raise $3,200. All the funds will go directly to create the music video. The equipment rental, production crew, and location travel in itself will cost $1,500. That leaves me with $1,700 for costumes, make-up, dancers, food, actors, choreography, and rehearsal time. 
To see it more clearly: 3 Dancers @ 200 for their rehearsal time and shoot date (and that is on the Omie-is-my-Homie rate) = 600 + Main actress (200) = 800. Now, costumes, including mine, say 8 costumes total for the dancers, myself, and the main actress, @ 60 bucks each = 480. Now I want to feed my people of course! :) Good thing we are all on a diet = 200 for food and beverages. Make up and hair stylists (2 @ 200 each) = 400. And there you have it, how the budget can easily just go. So your contribution will help tremendously on providing me with a beautiful opportunity, and also jobs for all those beautiful and talented people I the industry! 

What You Get
You will get some really cool stuff for helping out!!!! Any donations of $1 or more will get an autographed picture!! Donations of $25 or more will get an autographed picture plus a copy of my EP!

<p>Teenage survivor of an epic solo train trip from Nazi-occupied Zagreb to freedom in 1940 without the

<p>Flory became a composer and performer, singing songs
learned from her Nona (grandmother) and writing new ones; a beacon for the
Sephardic community, a “Keeper of the Flame.” As her children grew she brought
them on stage with her, telling stories that brought her village to life for audiences
all over the world. Flory received a National Heritage Award, she stars in the 2014 documentary <b>Flory's Flame</b>, and Jews everywhere sing her Hanukah

<p><span>Great music is like air and water. It surrounds everything we do. Our earliest childhood memories -- close friends and family. Lying on our floor alone, or standing hot and sweaty in a huge crowd. We make new friends. We fall in love. Our hearts break when we lose things close to us. </span></p>
<p><span>Music winds its way through all of these, beyond our lives and into human history. Poets don't always understand it. Pastors think it comes from God. Scientists think that music came before speech and was how the beginning of civilization was built. We can't stop making it! </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We depend on music to soothe us and save us, p</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">roviding comfort in hard times, whether those hard times were the physically demanding stone age or the more moral hardships of modern life.</span></p>
<p><span><span>The demand for songs is simply universal. It helps us face fear -- feelings of being out of place, the fear of rejection, the yearning for human connection, the desire to explore. And these songs are at the intersection of the now and the primal. </span><br/></span></p>
<p>We’re Californians in 2016, and we’ve learned some things about music in the intervening millennia. Some tools we have now have been around forever -- like our voices and our drums. Those tools are the beginnings of music. They're the canvas on which we paint with more modern inventions, like guitars and synths.</p>
<p>The four of us make music because we can't help it. Talk to one of us for even a few seconds and you see the depth we're invested in our careers, no hesitation -- no ""if music doesn't work out, we'll go jump into something safe."" Chris literally can not stop pounding on whatever's in front of him. Ryan often wakes up in the middle of the night to write five songs in a row.

</div></div>","What is this about? 
Great music is like air and water. It surrounds everything we do. Our earliest childhood memories -- close friends and family. Lying on our floor alone, or standing hot and sweaty in a huge crowd. We make new friends. We fall in love. Our hearts break when we lose things close to us. 
Music winds its way through all of these, beyond our lives and into human history. Poets don't always understand it. Pastors think it comes from God. Scientists think that music came before speech and was how the beginning of civilization was built. We can't stop making it! We depend on music to soothe us and save us, providing comfort in hard times, whether those hard times were the physically demanding stone age or the more moral hardships of modern life.
The demand for songs is simply universal. It helps us face fear -- feelings of being out of place, the fear of rejection, the yearning for human connection, the desire to explore. And these songs are at the intersection of the now and the primal. 
We’re Californians in 2016, and we’ve learned some things about music in the intervening millennia. Some tools we have now have been around forever -- like our voices and our drums. Those tools are the beginnings of music. They're the canvas on which we paint with more modern inventions, like guitars and synths.
The four of us make music because we can't help it. Talk to one of us for even a few seconds and you see the depth we're invested in our careers, no hesitation -- no ""if music doesn't work out, we'll go jump into something safe."" Chris literally can not stop pounding on whatever's in front of him. Ryan often wakes up in the middle of the night to write five songs in a row. We've slept in furniture stores, on couches and floors, and only two of us have a car. The world is a scary and anxious place when you leave it all out there. To us, you guys make the difference between a world that feels right and a world that doesn't.

We’ve recorded out of pocket before, and we've recorded with a label before. In a vacuum, we could self finance, but it would take years to do. We aren't looking at this as a shortcut. We look at this as an opportunity. Finally, we can all join forces and do something we couldn't do in a vacuum. 
The last EP we made was great, but we've grown as artists. Our songs need things we can't do from scratch by ourselves, and need new help from great industry contacts. 
We’re asking you, our fans, friends and family members, to invest in us. Our vision for the next phase of our career stems from this group of primal, real songs. From there we want to hire a producer/engineer, work out of a large recording studio, and then -- most importantly -- push our music to the world with a professionally managed radio push and a focused, disciplined local/regional market publicity campaign. 
We’re hoping that by doing it together now, we can do it well enough that we won't exclusively have to depend on crowdfunding again.

<div>Hello! My name is Doris Fields aka Lady D. I am a singer/songwriter and actress. I am also a radio host and now, a festival organizer! I, along with my friend and fellow blues lover, Antonia Ritchie have been organizing the Simply Jazz and Blues Festival since 2013 here in the heart of southern WV. Struggling against a dwindling coal driven economy, we feel that the Arts are definitely ""what's next"" for the southern coalfields and exposing people to America's ""roots"" music, the Blues is a great place to begin the road to recovery. Although we don't have the ultimate solution to the area's economic woes, nor are we able to cure disease or end poverty but we know that music is not only important; it is necessary. Music's beneficial effects on mind and body have been known for thousands of years, so ""music is medicine!""</div>
<div>We like to think of the Simply Jazz and Blues Festival as a shot of love and happiness injected into our Appalachian summer. We offer three days of jazz, blues and gospel music that not only gives local audiences the opportunity to enjoy what is not very mainstream for this neck of the woods but we also attract a blues audience from outside the state to our beautiful mountains and wonderful hospitality!</div>
<div>We have put this festival on year after year through sponsorships, program advertising and out of pocket. It is slowly catching on at the local level and support is increasing, but not to the point that the total cost of the festival is covered. This has definitely been a labor of love to bring local, regional and national artists to Beckley for the past 3 years, but we have to be more aggressive now in asking for the support of not only businesses but the public in general. We are not able to do it without YOU! Did I mention that this is a FREE festival? Word Park in uptown Beckley comes to life the third weekend of August with the sounds of the music that shaped America and we offer it FREE of charge to the public but it is not free for us to put it on.<br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>The whole festival could be covered for $25,000! This includes the artists' fees (14 acts over 3 days), sound and lighting, insurance, security, hotel rooms, food for hospitality and advertising. We are setting a goal here of $10,000. If we can reach this goal, we can at least feel somewhat comfortable that the balance can be made up in sponsorships and advertising. We've added some perks to give you a little incentive to help us out. As little as $5 would be so very appreciated as it does add up!</div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hello! My name is Doris Fields aka Lady D. I am a singer/songwriter and actress. I am also a radio host and now, a festival organizer! I, along with my friend and fellow blues lover, Antonia Ritchie have been organizing the Simply Jazz and Blues Festival since 2013 here in the heart of southern WV. Struggling against a dwindling coal driven economy, we feel that the Arts are definitely ""what's next"" for the southern coalfields and exposing people to America's ""roots"" music, the Blues is a great place to begin the road to recovery. Although we don't have the ultimate solution to the area's economic woes, nor are we able to cure disease or end poverty but we know that music is not only important; it is necessary. Music's beneficial effects on mind and body have been known for thousands of years, so ""music is medicine!""
We like to think of the Simply Jazz and Blues Festival as a shot of love and happiness injected into our Appalachian summer. We offer three days of jazz, blues and gospel music that not only gives local audiences the opportunity to enjoy what is not very mainstream for this neck of the woods but we also attract a blues audience from outside the state to our beautiful mountains and wonderful hospitality!
We have put this festival on year after year through sponsorships, program advertising and out of pocket. It is slowly catching on at the local level and support is increasing, but not to the point that the total cost of the festival is covered. This has definitely been a labor of love to bring local, regional and national artists to Beckley for the past 3 years, but we have to be more aggressive now in asking for the support of not only businesses but the public in general. We are not able to do it without YOU! Did I mention that this is a FREE festival? Word Park in uptown Beckley comes to life the third weekend of August with the sounds of the music that shaped America and we offer it FREE of charge to the public but it is not free for us to put it on.
   What We Need & What You Get
The whole festival could be covered for $25,000! This includes the artists' fees (14 acts over 3 days), sound and lighting, insurance, security, hotel rooms, food for hospitality and advertising. We are setting a goal here of $10,000. If we can reach this goal, we can at least feel somewhat comfortable that the balance can be made up in sponsorships and advertising. We've added some perks to give you a little incentive to help us out. As little as $5 would be so very appreciated as it does add up!

<p>My name is Michael Reisman.  Some of you know me as Bongo.  I’ve been a musician since as far back as I can remember, writing and singing my own stuff for 20 years now.  I’m also a father, husband and progressive early childhood educator.  I’ve been in bands as a drummer and guitarist in New Jersey, Bremerton and Seattle for years, but I want to introduce you to a new musical endeavor.  Introducing Michael Reisman is an artistic re-envisioning of me as a contemporary American folk artist, much as I’ve always been, but not the same.  Introducing…is a new collection of original songs that not only tell the intimate story of my life and perspective, but stories and perspectives that I believe speak to the lives of the contemporary American family, man, woman and child.  Introducing… requires your help, so I am asking you to participate in the process of creation: creation of this project, as well as others to come.  Your contributions in support of this album will allow me to release this collection of original, fully arranged songs written over the last ten years.  Although this record is what one might consider a “solo” release, many other folks you know, or know of, have contributed.  Releasing this music, spreading it live and on social media, will give others the opportunity to hear it and choose local level folk artistry for themselves as an alternative to what the commercial music industry puts in front of us.   Your support of my project brings you closer to the creation process, closer to my music, and closer to future projects and collaborations.  Maybe closer than you think…</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need and What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Introducing Michael Reisman requires $5000 to mix, master, reproduce and release.  So far the project has benefited from the donated talents of many of the artists and collaborators I have worked with in past years.  We recorded all the basic tracks at Eric Waldman’s (Bobby Beetcut) Revolutionary War Historical home in Wantage, NJ.  Overdubs happened everywhere.  Zach Green and David Brinen recorded horns at Princeton Stained Glass in Union City, NJ.  Organ and piano parts were recorded by Mitch Weinberger (Chester Cates) in Bellingham, WA.  Eric has been editing the material to be mixed, and you can find some sample mixes prepared by Barry Rose on this page.  Andrew Hankins recorded and edited the promotional video you saw at the top of the page.  For better or for worse, I have reached the end of the line of kindly donated skills and services, and now must raise the funds to pay for the completion and release of the project.  There will be a very limited release of hard copy CDs, including artwork and thank yous.  No matter what level you contribute, you will receive a CD.  The CD release will coincide with a digital release via traditional online platforms, so the music will be available to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Contribution gifts are tiered:</strong></p>
<p>Perks for your contributions start at $25 and ALL come with at least one hard copy CD AND a digital copy of the album for easy sharing.  An assortment of creative and inclusive perks and demonstrations of my gratitude for your generosity can be found on this page, but I've tried to keep it simple.  I know you will find a gift that suits your budget.  If you do not, please contact me so we can work something out!</p>
<p><strong>Why Support Introducing Michael Reisman?</strong></p>
<p>We make music choices with our hard-earned dollars almost every day.  Whether you pay for subscription online music services, purchase digital downloads, or are at the record store holding LPs in your hand, the music you love is more readily available to you than ever before.  If you are a fanatic like me, you are willing to save up any spare dollars you can find to purchase higher priced, limited edition collections that represent the particularities of your favorite artist or era.  Chances are you know me personally, via one capacity or another, or you know my friends, band-mates and co-collaborators.  This sourcing opportunity is a chance for you to make that same musical choice, but to support artists with whom you have a personal tie or relationship, on a grass roots level.  Without your support, this project will not be completed, and the songs will not be heard.  The world will not end.  Holden will continue to eat.  But the collective efforts of nearly a dozen musicians will come to a grinding halt. </p>
<p>This is not pop, club, house or dance music.  It’s contemporary folk/rock/singer-songwriter, Americana, if you will.  My songs provide an intimate insight into the multiple perspectives that occupy my mind yet reflect our world, our community.  We are families, artists, educators and contributors to society.  We are members of a diverse economic class.  Some have disposable income.  Some do not.  But all of us buy music.  Here is a choice to not only buy MY music but support it as a worthwhile, community-oriented, artistic endeavor.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s Make This Happen Together</strong></p>
<p>Crowdsourcing/funding a project like this is very scary.  Failure is simply not an option, at the risk of my own artistic self-esteem!  Not everyone can contribute financially.  Just like the musicians and artists who have contributed their talents and time to this project, you can still help, even if you cannot contribute your own dollars.  Simply pass the campaign along to your friends and family, especially those who care about the local artist and musician, and tell them you want to support this project, and ask them to contribute on your behalf.  Indiegogo has sharing tools embedded on this page to make for easy sharing.  That’s why every contribution level comes with, minimally, the gift of CD and digital album for easy sharing!  Because in the end all contributors, artists, and patrons alike, will want the music heard, and more music to be made.  Right?  I sure hope so.  Thank you!</p>

The album features 10 different tracks and below you will find a summary of the track names and styles.</div><div> </div><div>
<strong>Bacon Grease</strong> - A medium swing minor blues that is very gritty!</div><div>
<strong>I Used to Say</strong> - This tune features trumpeter Joshua Kauffman in a Stan Kenton style ballad.</div><div>
<strong>Vesuvius</strong> - The title track mixes Afro-Cuban styles with up tempo swing to create an explosive piece.</div><div>
<strong>Double or Nothing </strong>- A tribute to the great spy movie soundtracks of the past, this tune goes between a fast paced straight 8th feel, a sophisticated swing feel, and a light tango.</div><div>
<strong>A Night in Tunisia</strong> - Originally in 4/4, this arrangement features a three piece Afro-Cuban percussion section in 9/8.</div><div>
<strong>Spank-A-Lee</strong> - This arrangement shares a lot of similarities with the original Herbie Hancock tune released on ""Thrust"" in the 70's and will feature our guest artist Pat Coil on multiple keyboards.</div><div>
<strong>Samba Juice</strong> - A delightfully playful samba that features many different soloists from the band.</div><div>
<strong>The Kitchen Sink</strong> - This piece has it all, and you can find just about everything you could want when it comes to Funk in this one. Drew was asked to write the most difficult piece he could for this commission, and it definitely comes across.</div><div>
<strong>Job (Aftermath)</strong> - An introspective piece in 5/4 that features our second trombonist Conner Eisenmenger. This piece is based on the biblical character Job and is similar to the Maria Schneider style of big band writing.</div><div>
<strong>Kangaroo Bruise Blues</strong> - Named due to Toshi's background in Australia, this piece is an up tempo blues that features almost everyone. Thad Jones' writing style was definitely channeled by Drew when he wrote this composition.</div><div><strong>*BONUS TRACK* </strong></div><div>

The title of the album comes from the active volcano located in Naples, Italy called Mt. Vesuvius, and the pieces recorded for the album are meant to be a reflection of the awe inspiring power and energy of the great volcano. We hope to provide a full big band album at the highest possible quality.The members of the band come from around the United States and have all studied or are currently studying music at The University of North Texas. We are excited to perform and record this music for you, but in order to do so we are seeking additional funds. Meet the Band:Due to our enormous size of 18 full time and 5 part time members we have a lot of great information about each of them for you to have a look at. Above you will find both videos and pictures for each member, plus each picture also includes a brief bio so you can get to know the player that little bit more! Here is one of the videos from our trombone player Conner Eisenmenger.For even more information check out our website at: http://www.toshiclinchmusic.com/tcbb/Listen to the Band:This is one of the pieces that will be featured on Vesuvius. It is Toshi Clinch's arrangement of the popular jazz standard ""A Night in Tunisia"" by Dizzy Gillespie, performed by some of the members of the TCBB. There are also Sneak Peek videos from our first rehearsal at the top of this page. Here is a snippet of Bacon Grease composed by Toshi Clinch. 

 
You can listen to another recording of the A Night in Tunisia here:https://soundcloud.com/toshi-clinch/a-night-in-...To listen to Toshi's arrangement of Back at the Chicken Shack composed by Jimmy Smith follow the link here: https://soundcloud.com/toshi-clinch/back-at-the...The band is also putting on a live concert in April where we will be performing every piece from the upcoming album. The concert will also feature compositions and arrangements from members of the band as well as local artists. This is definitely an event not to miss if you live in the Dallas, Fort Worth area. All of the details can be seen below.What We Need & What You Get:In total the band is looking for $11,000 USD to fund this entire project. This money goes towards many aspects of making a record including paying the musicians, hiring the studio and recording engineer, distributing the product, CD artwork, advertising and production costs. For those that contribute to this Indiegogo Campaign you have many options to choose from when it comes to perks. No matter what you contribute we want to make you feel valued, and to let you know that this project would not be able to happen without your contribution. For more information about the perks, you can check out each one to the right or watch the video below. The Track List: The album features many different styles and tracks which Drew and Toshi help breakdown in the video above. The album features 10 different tracks and below you will find a summary of the track names and styles. 
Bacon Grease - A medium swing minor blues that is very gritty!
I Used to Say - This tune features trumpeter Joshua Kauffman in a Stan Kenton style ballad.
Vesuvius - The title track mixes Afro-Cuban styles with up tempo swing to create an explosive piece.
Double or Nothing - A tribute to the great spy movie soundtracks of the past, this tune goes between a fast paced straight 8th feel, a sophisticated swing feel, and a light tango.
A Night in Tunisia - Originally in 4/4, this arrangement features a three piece Afro-Cuban percussion section in 9/8.
Spank-A-Lee - This arrangement shares a lot of similarities with the original Herbie Hancock tune released on ""Thrust"" in the 70's and will feature our guest artist Pat Coil on multiple keyboards.
Samba Juice - A delightfully playful samba that features many different soloists from the band.
The Kitchen Sink - This piece has it all, and you can find just about everything you could want when it comes to Funk in this one. Drew was asked to write the most difficult piece he could for this commission, and it definitely comes across.
Job (Aftermath) - An introspective piece in 5/4 that features our second trombonist Conner Eisenmenger. This piece is based on the biblical character Job and is similar to the Maria Schneider style of big band writing.
Kangaroo Bruise Blues - Named due to Toshi's background in Australia, this piece is an up tempo blues that features almost everyone. Thad Jones' writing style was definitely channeled by Drew when he wrote this composition.*BONUS TRACK* 
Back at the Chicken Shack - For those that contribute towards one of the multiple packages that include this bonus track that will not be publicly released, you will hear a swinging shuffle blues that features the Organ playing of Pat Coil. Definitely not a tune to be missed! The Impact:Due to the significant cost associated with making an album of this magnitude, we want you to know that every contribution to this project will make a significant impact to the making of Vesuvius.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I’m Brandon Patrick George. Originally born in Ohio, I moved to New York City almost ten years ago. I had a crazy idea to move to New York and to forge my own path as a flutist. Maybe it’s working. I’ve performed recitals and chamber music concerts at leading concert halls including Alice Tully Hall, the Kennedy Center, Cité de la Musique, and Bargemusic. As an ensemble player, I’ve performed with one of our country’s great symphonies— the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra—and with the International Contemporary Ensemble (ICE) in Chicago and in England at the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival. All of which have been critically acclaimed by the press including mentions by the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, and <i>Chicago Tribune</i>.</p>
<p>My interest in music in extends from early to contemporary classical music. This debut album is a tapestry of my wide range of performance work, featuring compositions by musical giants including J.S. Bach, Pierre Boulez, and Sergei Prokofiev, and introducing a new, solo work by the living, Finnish composer Kalevi Aho.</p>
<p>The instruments, too, are a mosaic of old and new: among them is a new, modern flute, yet made from wood; and an historic 1939 platinum flute intended to broaden the possibilities of the instrument for future generations. </p>
<p>This album honors American craftsmanship and legacy. Powell Flute’s first platinum instrument, commissioned for the 1939 World’s Fair, is featured on this recording.</p>
<p>Other Powell instruments will be used on this recording, including a modern flute made of grenadilla wood.</p>

<p>If 100% of the goal is not met, the monies will be used to compensate all the professionals who will be working with and collaborating with me on the project. But the full $10,000.00 guarantees the album.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Recordings are essential for independent artists.</p>
<p>People are listening to music more now than ever. However, it still takes resources to make the same great music that today’s listeners find through streaming services, instead of a brick and mortar music shop.</p>
<p>This album also honors American craftsmanship and legacy. Verne Q. Powell Flutes, Inc., in Boston, began making flutes in 1927. Powell’s excellence in flute making earned him the responsibility of creating #365: the firm’s very first platinum flute commissioned for the 1939 World’s Fair—an instrument that is featured on this recording. Your contribution to the successful production of this album allows history to be made: #365 will, by virtue of the instrument’s historicity, be a universal, archival landmark for the future.</p>

Hi! I'm Dr. Henry Darragh, (aka 'Doc Loc'), and I'm from Pasadena, Texas. I grew up listening to hip-hop and became a professional (mostly jazz) musician in 1994. My love of Houston rap and big band jazz is the driving force behind Doc Loc and the Swangers.
After releasing ""Draped Up"" and ""Sittin' Sidewayz"" (feat. Paul Wall and Big Pokey) last summer (and with the help of friends and a grant from Houston Arts Alliance), we produced six more Southside Classics. I began this dream of an idea in 2013 and this concert will be the celebration of all the work that's gone into the project.

What We Need & What You Get

I need the funds to pay the band for rehearsal, for the show, and the venue rental.
For supporting the campaign, we have the downloads to send pre-street release date, concert tickets, t-shirts, and even a possible music lesson with me (Dr. Henry Darragh)
All of the funds will go towards paying the musicians and covering the cost of the venue. The show will go on somehow if the funds are not all raised.


The Impact
My project is a valuable representation of classic Houston hip-hop performed by big band for the first time, however, one doesn't have to like rap or jazz to appreciate the music.

Risks & Challenges
The hurdles I have to achieve my goal are actually small. I have a rehearsal to schedule (of 15 musicians) and I have the obstacle of getting the funds to pay them.

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>This outfit first started off as solo musician, 'Templeton' (whose past bands included Birdhouse, First Black President and The Bends), and morphed into '<strong>Templeton Universe</strong>' on this 5th album called '<i><strong>Between Lies</strong></i>'. We are an independent band (meaning we are not signed/managed and do EVERYTHING ourselves). Get an acoustic taste of what we do below (this song is off our last album, 'Headspace'):</p>
<p> </p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/eNk48x85IGQ"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>Templeton roughed it out alone with his last four albums ('<strong>Templeton</strong>', '<strong>Boy on Bike</strong>', '<strong>Twist</strong>' and '<strong>Headspace</strong>' — which will ALL be given to you along with the latest album in our 'prestige package') over the last decade.</p>
<p>But, now with the band behind him and more ideas streaming in, we're asking for some help in launching this latest album the <i>right way</i>. This means getting the CD registered (bar code and distribution), getting the CD glass-mastered, design fees for the cover artwork and across-the-board marketing of the album.</p>
<p>Here's a song/video from '<i>Boy on Bike</i>' called '<i>On Bended Knee</i>':</p>

<h3><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Every single package GUARANTEES you an <strong>IMMEDIATE digital download</strong> (within 24 hours) of 'Between Lies' BEFORE it gets released (release date set at 1 May 2017) — you get to sample the music before the rest of the world does as well as <strong><i>exclusive updates</i></strong> on what we're trying to achieve (it's a journey we'd LOVE to share with you).</p>
<p>The more you pledge, the more you get and we're offering up to <strong>5 digital albums</strong>!</p>

<p><i><strong>""</strong>The first thing that crossed my mind on hearing the first few bars and vocal introducing itself was "" Rufus Wainwright"", a vocalist who I hugely admire so that's a good start! The more I listened I could hear other influences, the way the track has been crafted with some great changes had me thinking of the great Jeff Buckley - however, I have to be clear ""Templeton (Universe)"" is not trying to be anything other than Templeton and this track is a great song,well written and well produced, beautiful vocal, great instrumentation well crafted. In a nutshell it hits all the right buttons and I cant find a single criticism, apart from the fact I think it could have been a bit longer - more like this and the right promotion and we should be seeing him/them getting to the top!

<h3><strong>What's the Music About?</strong></h3>
<p>Glad you asked!</p>
<p>We've dubbed ourselves ambient rock and we're a melting pot of The Beatles/Muse/Zero 7/Radiohead/Rufus Wainwright/Elliot Smith. Our somewhat cheesy tagline is '<i>Cosmic Music for the Alternative Soul</i>' which pretty much translates to:  boundary pushing sounds for ears that appreciate music driven by spirit, mastered by dedication and fueled with passion.</p>
<p>We love to make and perform music. It's our life.</p>
<p>Our heaviest musical influences were mentioned above but also include Queen, Pink Floyd, David Bowie, RHCP, Sigur Ros, Nirvana, Neil Young, Jeff Buckley, Skunk Anansie, as well as classical composers such as Bach, Debussy, Tchaikovsky and Saint-Saens.</p>
<p>We strive to give back to music what these artists have given to us — the soundtrack of our lives, the jet-fuel in our veins, the sweet remedy to our emotions. </p>
<p>This latest album takes the listener down that red-pill, rabbit hole of truth, lies and self awakening. As the saying goes, <i><strong>""The truth will set you free but it will piss you off first""</strong></i>, well this pretty much sums up the undercurrent of the album.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491649244/hliyqpplhqewsmfdy42y.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We're very hot-blooded about current world/political/spiritual/social issues and try to inject our songs with our take on a society gone mad. Our music not only highlights these issues but also reminds us of an ever-present, underlying hope that <i>love</i> will ALWAYS win the day. Other what would the point be, right?</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; Packages on Offer</h3>
<p>We have already self-funded the production of the album and it is ready to go out into the big wide world. What we still need help with now is a little extra funding — $1000 to be precise. This is broken down into:</p>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>Registering the album,</li>
<li>Final Cover Design,</li>
<li>Glass mastering,</li>
<li>Packaging,</li>

<p>If we don't reach our goal of $1000, we will use the funds to do as much as we can along the lines of registering, designing the cover and advertising the new album. </p>

<p>Hi, my name is Sebastiano Dessanay, I am an Italian double bassist and composer based in the UK.</p>
<p>I grew up in an ‘operatic’ family, my granddad was first director of the opera theatre in Cagliari. I was only 10 when he tragically died, but after the loss, my mum started to bring me with her to see operas, mostly Italian (Puccini, Verdi) but not only (I fell asleep during Mozart’s Don Giovanni!). Over the years, I have participated to operas in the children’s choir, as a walk-on, as a double bassist, and finally I took the courage to write my own!</p>

<h3>What and Who you are supporting</h3>
<p>Between 2011 and 2013 I wrote <i>The Cry of the Double Bass</i>, a contemporary music work, with a beautiful libretto by English writer Mike Carter, celebrating not only my instrument, the double bass, but also a musical genre I am very fond of.</p>
<p>An opera about powerful passions and broken dreams, <i>The Cry of the Double Bass </i>charts a young man’s struggle against outer obstacles and inner demons to answer the call of his soul and realise his lifelong ambition in music. A deep and affecting work that will resonate with people of all ages.</p>

Visit http://www.tete-a-tete.org.uk/event/the-cry-of-... to buy tickets for the opera's Act 3 premiere! 

On the 10th of August 2017 part of this work will be finally seeing the lights of a theatre for the first time, at the 10th anniversary of the Tête à Tête Festival in London. It will be one of the most important achievements of my artistic and personal life.
By supporting this project you will contribute to fairly reward all the creative team and amazing artists who have agreed to be part of it. But mostly, you will help getting a strong message out there for people of all ages and backgrounds: make your own decisions and follow your heart.


What I have and what I need 
Tête à Tête kindly provides the Studio Theatre at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, a fantastic venue in Central London, and they will carry out a big marketing and advertising campaign, but I need to provide a finished production.
All the funding application we did were unsuccessful, therefore this campaign is the only mean we have to put the performance on. I am asking you to contribute to part of the production costs. Whatever amount we raise, it will be used towards the performance of my work at Tête à Tête Festival 2017.
The Creative and Production Team
This space is dedicated to the amazing collaborators who are going to help me in this adventure. To know more about me there is my website www.sebastianodessanay.com
Writer and theatre director Mike Carter wrote the beautiful libretto of the opera. He is going to be assistant director in this production.
Friend and long time collaborator, choreographer Riccardo Buscarini will provide his artistic vision in directing and choreographing the work.
Daniele Rosina, Director of Orchestral Studies at the University of Birmingham, will be conducting the performers.
Members of Decibel Ensemble, together with Birmingham-based freelance musicians, will constitute the main orchestral forces. With Decibel, a double bass quartet and a double bass soloist will perform on stage. 
The cast consists of two sopranos, a baritone, a bass, an actor and a dancer. Among them, the amazing Themba Mvula as the protagonist as Young Man, and soprano Natalie Raybould ​playing the protagonist as Boy.
Rosie Clements is helping with the production side of things.
 
A breakdown of the costs
- £1,000: pre-production costs (producer fee, piano reduction, parts production and print, website and logo design)
- £1,000: director, conductor, lighting designer fees
- £2,000: performer and singer fees for rehearsals and performance
- £1,000: travel expenses, stationery and contingency.
What you get in return
For your kind support I offer perks such as special mentions in the programmes and social media, free tickets to the Tête à Tête show, copies of my CDs, a bound copy of the opera libretto, a bound copy of the opera score, an exclusive dinner with the creatives behind the project, and the composition of a personalised opera aria with text provided by you!

Other ways you can help
Even if you can't support the project financially, please share this campaign with your friends and contacts! You will help us promoting the message: make your own decisions and follow your heart!

Through it all there has been this album changing along with me.  A lot of the songs that were on the album in 2013 are not there anymore. But I think what’s in its place is deeper and better. In some ways it feels less like an album and more like a soundtrack to the last six years of my life.I am so excited/relieved/happy/many other emotions to have it so close to done. That being said, due to many studio hours and a crazy year of health (re: heavy metal poisoning), I am so close and yet, still so far away!What this baby needsHere’s the deal peeps: All the recording is complete. Here are the final tasks I am trying to finish up!
Final edits
Mastering
Replication
Digital downloads
Hopefully playing some shows in the PAC west!

Other Ways You Can HelpAs someone who hasn't been to the dentist in a length of time I am choosing not to disclose so that you won't judge my hygiene, I understand completely if you are not in a position to give $. Sometimes you just don’t have it, and if you did, you’d go to the goshdang dentist! However, you can still help out if you are so inclined!
If you can share the word that I have a new album coming out, that would be amazing!
If you can share the word that I have an Indiegogo campaign right now, that would be amazing!
If you know of people who live in cities I will be going to play in and could give them a heads up, or have them get updates via my socials, that would be amazing!
If you would consider signing up for email updates, that would be amazing!
If you would consider using the Indiegogo share tools, that would be amazing!
MANY MANY MANY THANKS!  So many of you have helped in so many ways in the last 6 years. If you are on this page and read this far, I APPRECIATE YOU AND YOUR TIME SO MUCH. THANK YOU.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! :) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I‘m Isabel, a cellist and composer - born in Germany and currently living and working in Switzerland. </p>
<p>Since years it has been my dream to record my own solo CD with multitrack compositions of mine. And if not now when else shall it ever happen? Half a year ago I have finally started to write the pieces and put them together.</p>
<p>This project is really important for me, because I have always felt like my way of musical creation doesn‘t really fit into the classical music industry. The industry is always about: younger, faster, and more „perfect“ music making - but I really think that music should be: creating something that you put thought, dedication, passion and time into. I want to create my music that expresses my feelings and experiences. </p>

<h3>What I need your contribution for</h3>
<p>Recording professionally in Switzerland is unfortunately really expensive.</p>
<p>Studios and mixing is total around 8000 CHF. </p>
<p>The rental of the studio will be around 4000 CHF, recording/mixing around 4000 CHF.</p>
<p>A small part of my recording is already covered so that's why I am doing a crowdfunding now to mainly cover the bigger part of the mixing and recording costs.</p>

Hi! :) 
 
I‘m Isabel, a cellist and composer - born in Germany and currently living and working in Switzerland. 
Since years it has been my dream to record my own solo CD with multitrack compositions of mine. And if not now when else shall it ever happen? Half a year ago I have finally started to write the pieces and put them together.
This project is really important for me, because I have always felt like my way of musical creation doesn‘t really fit into the classical music industry. The industry is always about: younger, faster, and more „perfect“ music making - but I really think that music should be: creating something that you put thought, dedication, passion and time into. I want to create my music that expresses my feelings and experiences.

A small part of my recording is already covered so that's why I am doing a crowdfunding now to mainly cover the bigger part of the mixing and recording costs.

<h3>Just Another Crowdfunding Campaign, Just Another Bluegrass Record. Right? </h3>
<p>Wrong. At least, mostly wrong. This will be a decidedly bluegrass record.</p>
<p>Jon and Justin met each other more than six years ago and together they've been playing music, writing songs, and making waves in the bluegrass community ever since.</p>
<p> Jon was the first recipient of the International Bluegrass Music Association's Songwriter of the Year Award in 2012. He's had close to 200 of his songs recorded, including nearly a dozen bluyegrass #1s, he plays bass with Chris Jones and the Night Drivers, hosts a radio show on SiriusXM's Bluegrass Junction with Del McCoury, and is a living, breathing encyclopedia of bluegrass history. </p>
<p> Justin was nominated for IBMA's Instrumentalist Momentum Award in 2016 for his banjo playing. He's performed with Laurie Lewis, Jim Lauderdale, Roland White, and many others. His songs have been showcased by the IBMA and by <i>American Songwriter Magazine</i>, he's also a columnist for <i>the Bluegrass Situation</i>, and he organized Shout &amp; Shine, the bluegrass community's first ever showcase focused on diversity, at IBMA's World of Bluegrass. </p>
<p> Mid-2017 Jon and Justin cobbled together a band to play their debut show as a duo at the World Famous Station Inn in Nashville, Tennessee, in the process realizing that they'd gathered quite the collection of songs. An album's worth, even. So an idea was born. And that idea is what spawned this campaign, this very pitch, and you taking the time to read it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>No Risk, No Rewards. </h3>
<p> We know you know it. Making an album is an <i>extraordinarily</i> expensive process, even when you strip it down to the bone. There's the studio time, mixing and mastering, the talent, pressing the record, fulfilling our rewards, publicity, and Indiegogo's percentage. We've budgeted for only the absolute essentials because for us, funding the record means just that. Funding the record. Nothing more. No bells and whistles. (Bells and whistles ain't no part a-nothin anyhow.)</p>
<p> Think of this as a preorder. You can get in on the ground floor of something that's shaping up to be a fantastic album of good ol' fashioned bluegrass played by some of the most exciting musicians around. You can ""preorder"" the record as a digital download, a signed hard copy, or in a bundle with a signed poster or signed postcard. If you aren't burnt out on crowdfunding campaigns -- thank you for being an amazing human --  and want more than just a ""preorder,"" we've added some options beyond just the music and accoutrements. A songwriting consult? A tailor-made concert? This is a choose-your-own-adventure type of situation. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Wait... So How Is This <i>More</i> Than Just Another Crowdfunded Bluegrass Record?</h3>
<p> Thank you for bringing us back around to this point. The songs will hit your ears with that bluegrass familiarity we all love, but they aren't hackneyed, cliché, or heavy-handed. The instrumentation is well within the standard definition of the genre, but each of the players have unique, recognizable voices on their instruments. There's the band from our Station Inn show: Momentum Award winner Casey Campbell on mandolin; phenomenal, traditional-to-her-core fiddler Corrina Logston; and Amanda Fields on guitar with an invincible right hand. And we'll have a second band as well: Brandon Godman on fiddle, a veteran of Quicksilver, Dale Ann Bradley, and the Band Perry; Molly Tuttle, IBMA's reigning Guitar Player of the Year; and Tristan Scroggins, another Momentum Award winner and fiery mandolinist. Kimber Ludiker, of Della Mae fame and a Grand Master Fiddle Champion, will be lending a twin part here and there. We have some surprise guests vocalists lined up, too. (Support the album and we'll give you all the secrets as we go.) </p>
<p> Without meaning to, we've ended up with quite a diverse set of pickers on this album, playing... well, bluegrass. That's why this isn't just another bluegrass album. We didn't start out with an agenda, or an overarching goal, we've just been writing and making music that we love to write and make -- with people with whom we love to write and make music. That's why we and all of the talented folks on the roster are rearing and ready to go. </p>
<p> Music - especially bluegrass - doesn't exist without community. The community of musical people that have surrounded us throughout our careers and over the course of our friendship inspired this project and are actively making it a reality. It makes sense, then, to use this campaign to expand that community, bringing each and every one of you into the fold as well.  </p>
<p> Okay, so it is another bluegrass record. But not <i>just</i> another bluegrass record.</p>
<p> We hope you'll support our campaign, but if you can't -- don't sweat it, we've passed on plenty of crowdfunding projects ourselves -- give us a share, a tweet, a like, a signal boost, or whatever you can to get the word out. We've got songs about lost love, forbidding prairies, rare wildflowers, granite quarries, and raging fires to get out to the masses! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I started to play violin when I was a kid, but when I really decided to go on the music path was a couple of years ago. I've been traveling the world and gathering inspiration, which has given a mix of feels to my music. On the way I picked up didgeridoo and then half a year ago added it to my music. The didgeridoo combined with the violin and loop pedal unlocked a deeper and richer sound. As I continue on my musical journey, my sound and songs constantly develop and grow. During my last summer travels around the UK I met an amazing producer who offered me to record a professional quality album with him. This album will be part of European tour which I am setting up and it can only happen if I can afford a van to travel between shows.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need to get enough money to buy a van and cover costs of recording an album.</p>
<p>Whoever supports $10 or more I'll send you download code of the new album</p>
<p>Whoever supports $50 or more will receive a signed physical copy of new album with personal note</p>
<p>Whoever supports $500 or more I'll write a song especially for you, record it and send it to you</p>
<p>if you support with $5000 or more plus travel costs I'll travel to your home to play a personal show and cook a special Vojta's dinner for you... ;)</p>

<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Peruvian chicha music was born and exploded from the chaotic political context of the 80s. At the time, Peru was suffering from devastating economic inflation and terrorism, forcing Andean populations to migrate to a cruel and unwelcoming capital. Until this day, despite being undervalued and stigmatized, chicha music continues to have a strong sociocultural impact in the lives of working class Peruvians. </span></p>
<p>This expression of popular music produced from migration, caused abrupt social encounters and cultural frictions. Migrants who were forced to live in marginal spaces within the urban setting of Lima, began building their own identity by mixing the music and lyrics they brought from the Andes with city rhythms such as American psychedelic, Cuban guaracha, Colombian cumbia, among many other stunning hybrid styles. This led to the creation of  musical icons and finding new spaces for cultural expression. This is how the Andean cumbia (chicha) boom in Peru became an essential part of a key historical moment in Latin American cultural re-appreciation, not only having influence in music, but also in aesthetics, social, economic and even geographic aspects, all under the powerful name of “chicha”.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494901234/sqphbtpdhpggiduuqqdt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Seeing the importance of this dynamic history, the director of this project, Jalo Nuñez Del Prado, embarked on an arduous mission, traveling across Peru, to find the person at the heart of the chicha movement, Juan Campos Muñoz. Juan Campos was the driving force behind Discos Horóscopo, the record label responsible for launching and popularizing emblematic figures of Peruvian Chicha music like Chacalón &amp; La Nueva Crema, Los Shapis, Pintura Roja and Los Ovnis, among others.</p>

<p>Now, Discos Horoscópo returns 40 years later with the goal of legitimizing chicha music as part of Peru's immaterial heritage through the international release of the ten most emblematic chicha albums and a strong international press campaign, planting the seed to spread our musical identity worldwide.  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Until now, this project has grown and moved forward without any institutional or private support. This project has moved forward independently with the driving force of producing deluxe editions of these remastered albums. At least 12,000 Euros have been spent in the first stage (pre-production). Costs include: contract development, obtaining and purchasing catalog rights, restoring and digitizing the complete catalog, searching for and purchasing archival material to include in the final production, purchasing domain and web hosting, programming, graphic design, development of audiovisual materials, media and press, pre-production assistance, and operating costs. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In Peru, chicha music has been consistently criminalized, racialized, and devalued for its deep relationship with working class people. This project aims to revalorize and celebrate chicha as a brilliant force of style and music on par with other important musical movements in the world.  </p>
<p>To rescue, preserve, know, and spread the values of our cultural heritage signifies securing our sense of cultural identity and in turn defending our sovereignty. At the core of this project is the preservation and rescue of chicha music as a form of keeping our cultural heritage alive as well as making chicha music known and available on an international level through digital platforms such as spotify, itunes, apple music, google play, deezer, etc...</p>

The Impact
In Peru, chicha music has been consistently criminalized, racialized, and devalued for its deep relationship with working class people. This project aims to revalorize and celebrate chicha as a brilliant force of style and music on par with other important musical movements in the world.  
To rescue, preserve, know, and spread the values of our cultural heritage signifies securing our sense of cultural identity and in turn defending our sovereignty. At the core of this project is the preservation and rescue of chicha music as a form of keeping our cultural heritage alive as well as making chicha music known and available on an international level through digital platforms such as spotify, itunes, apple music, google play, deezer, etc...

<h3><strong>""Color of the Sound"" | Armen-Levon Manaseryan <i>/piano</i></strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I am an Armenian concert pianist, currently residing in Belgium.<br/>I  had numerous recitals, took part in concerts, festivals and I am the prize-winner of various international piano competitions in Armenia, Romania, France, Russia, Germany, Kazakhstan, Austria, Belgium, Italy, Poland and Malta. I am also the founder and artistic director of ""Vitrage"" charity festival  in Brussels.</p>
<p>Recently I won the 1st Prize and Trophy at the 5th Valletta International Piano Competition in Malta (2017). <strong>I was also awarded a special prize to record a CD with renowned ""KNS"" Classical label.</strong> The chance to record a CD is a big opportunity and I am hoping for your support and help in achieving this goal.</p>
<p>The program I wish to record includes <strong>""Pictures At an Exhibition"" by Mussorgsky and ""Six Dances"" by Komitas.</strong> Works by Komitas  has never been recorded on KNS Classical label and I will be glad to be the first. This is very important for me as an Armenian pianist. I will be once again spreading the Armenian music, which is always included in my repertoire. The project is very unique, because <strong>the CD will be also containing my paintings related to each of Mussorgsky's pictures.</strong>  </p>
<p>My other big passion is painting. The CD will also have an appendix brochure, containing my paintings related to each of Mussorgsky's pictures. Mussorgsky was inspired to write that piece by the exhibition of a Russian painter and architect Viktor Hartmann (1834-1873).</p>
<p>As a continuation of this inspiration into the 21st century I created a series of paintings, based on my personal impressions. In addition to my paintings the appendix brochure will also contain information about me, the composers and their works.</p>

<h3>The Band</h3>
<p>Dirty Heretics is an electro punk/thrash duo made up of Atesh Tur and Rachel Gavaletz. We have been writing and performing together for a little over a year. During our time together, we have selected a 4 song EP to be released this summer, and one of our songs has especially stood out. After a lot of meetings, storyboarding, and preparation, we are so excited to reach the next level with our music video for the single Black and Blue. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Song</h3>
<p>Black and Blue is about addiction. Unfortunately, it’s about a particular person’s addiction. Sterling Spiers passed away on Dec 6th 2015 of a heroin overdose at the age of 27. He was the brother of Rachel’s life-long best friend, Tommi-Sue Spiers. </p>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: <i>“I have written several songs about Sterling throughout the years. How could I not be affected by this person’s struggles and the pain he suffered? But it is subtle. I wanted the lyrics to be universal. Anyone struggling with addiction. Or depression. Or something dark. And as we played this song live, people really paid attention to it. Maybe it’s just the vibe of the song…. the dark trappy sound… I’m sure no one knew the first time they heard it what it was about. For whatever reason, our fans and audiences felt connected to it. And Atesh and I knew this was the song to use for the music video.”</i></p>
<p><b>Atesh:<i> </i></b><i>""Black and blue is a story about how an idea, a theme, can be interpreted in many different ways due to our mental states. The three distinctive parts of the song tell the same idea through completely different dynamics. First part is a slow middle eastern guitar intro playing a moody variation of the theme of the song. In the second part, the theme gets serious, more alerting as tension builds to the third part, where the story gains speed and builds up to a dark electro climax.""</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>So here's the deal...</h3>
<p>We have already broken down all the production costs including location, editing, and crew, and have chosen the flexible funding option on IndieGoGo. That way, if we don’t make it to our goal of $3,300, we can still use the funds we raise to help create this video. But the AMAZING part about crowdfunding is that $5 really does go a long way! In fact, our first perk starts at $5 which is a download card for our EP. If you are unable to give, PLEASE SHARE this page on social media! </p>

<h3>""Preachin' Drunk"" by Joe Cat music release.</h3>
<p>Hey Y'all.  My name is Joe Cat and I am a Americana Roots artist living in Athens GA. I have a gritty blue-collar sound that comes from real life experience. I tour most of the country playing my music in many bars, listening rooms, cafes, &amp; breweries. I spend about 200 days on the road a year taking my music to all demographics of people in this country. After the last ten years I have made many great friends that also enjoy my music and stories. When I first started playing again years ago, I did so for my own health. The heavy stress of life compelled me to play for hours, just to drown out the struggles of everyday life. I would essentially get lost in my own music while playing. It was and still remains the best therapy you could ever ask for. I have come to realize, in all of the places that I visit and play, the music has the same effect on many others. Many people relate to my songs, and find an escape from their everyday lives in them. What I have originally created to sooth my own soul has become so much more for many folks who get lost in the music with me. Along the way I have met and have been inspired by many other musicians and artist that have similar passions. Unfortunately, life is short and unpredictable. There have been so many of these same folks who have inspired and helped me along who unfortunately are only here with us now in spirit. It was their love, and encouragement that keep me working along, and playing my old heart out for strangers every night. I feel like I have finally found my purpose in life, and have vowed in all of their names to never slow down or stop. I want to inspire others to do what makes them happy. To express themselves and break free of the stress of everyday life. </p>
<p>My new album release, ""Preachin' Drunk"", is the first time that I have invited other musicians to come and record my music with me. The results are turning out to be the best music I have ever made. I have been working hard at my home studio, ""Cabin in the Sky Studios"" here in Athens GA with mastering to be done very soon at another local studio. I would be honored and eternally grateful to any of you who help contribute to this new effort of mine.  All of the money raised will be used to produce, vinyl, cd's, promotion, and pay for studio time. My goal is to raise a total of 5,000 dollars to help offset all of the cost of this process.</p>
<p>Hopefully I will be able to come out to where you are soon and play some of my music.</p>
<p>Thank-you for all of your help.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Eniola Anna Abioye. I was born in London, raised here in the States. I have loved words my whole life. Music, writing and design have been my favorite ways to express myself. I decided to launch this campaign to receive funding for an EP.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The full amount, I am asking for is $6000.</p>
<p>The money will cover the cost of production, mixing and mastering each song on the album, as well as paying musicians and creatives that will help create the sound.</p>
<p>If fully funded, by the end of November, beginning of December, at the latest, I'll have an EP (electronic album) for all to download off of iTunes and hear on various online music platforms. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If I am honest, I am nervous and scared. I have tried before to garner funds for big projects and failed miserably. How is this time different? It is different because I realize that fear is just the door I walk through to get to the other side of my biggest dreams, not the thing that holds me back. If I fail, I will not stop. I won't lick wounds. I will keep going, because I am convinced that this isn't just about scratching an itch, but fulfilling my destiny.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please pray and send me what you are sensing from the Lord, I want to hold these up as affirmations and confessions.</p>

<h3>Marty Mayhem and the Liabilities Debut Album</h3>
<p>Hey I'm Marty and I want to make an album. After years of various bands (good and bad) I have finally found my voice and style and the next step is to create a great record and get it out there. I have had some interest from labels, some good and some bad but I feel with the genre of music and the vibe the band has I want to go full DIY and put the record out myself. So I am asking for your help in raising the funds and in return I can give you some cool stuff. I feel we can do this together!</p>
<p>I have been playing music for a decade now and nine times out of ten I have had the backing of my brother Alex on drums, and this time is no different. There's just something different that happens when we play together. I will get some other local musicians to get involved. I plan to record at a small local studio as to help them out too, we are looking at local printers to produce the CDs, Cassettes, Posters. Hopefully I won't just get an album recorded and out there but I can help some small local businesses out at the same time.</p>
<p>The album is written and demo'd and we are starting to make final tweeks. So once the money has  been raised I can get straight into the studio. Recording, mixin, mastering and then printing materials and duplicating CDs.  I envisage this taking around 3 months to do it properly. With any luck you'll have a great new rock n roll  album in your hands before the end of the year.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So, I have put on my business head (yes I suppose having a day job did have its uses) and I have crunched the figures and decided I need another £750 all in to get the job done (I have already had some generous donations, many thanks to those people). This includes recording, printing, photos, artwork.... The whole thing. If we can raise more than this I can look at more studio time, currently I plan on spending 2 full days in the studio which is not long in album terms but, if Led Zepplin can do it then so can I! Any extra money raised will be spent on studio time and promotional material. </p>
<p>On the flip side, if I don't reach the target the show will still go on. I will do more shows, busk, whatever it takes to get the money together, it might just take a little while longer to get the record out there. </p>
<p>I have put together some cool ""packages"" for you to buy! </p>
<p>Millennial - Download of the album/ demos</p>
<p>Casual Fan - CD and Poster</p>
<p>Retro - Cassette (yes we are putting the album on cassette) Poster, Demos</p>
<p>Guru - CD, Demos, Lyric Sheet</p>
<p>Collectors - Everything and more!! CD, Cassette, Demos, Poster, Lyric Sheet, and anything else I have to hand.</p>
<p>Of course your can just buy the CD if that's what you want.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Whether you can contribute or not I need your help to get the word out there about the album  and what I am trying to do. So please share on social media, tell your mates! To help you there are some share tools right here on Indiegogo.</p>
<p>Thanks for your support! </p>

There's just something different that happens when we play together. I will get some other local musicians to get involved. I plan to record at a small local studio as to help them out too, we are looking at local printers to produce the CDs, Cassettes, Posters. Hopefully I won't just get an album recorded and out there but I can help some small local businesses out at the same time.
The album is written and demo'd and we are starting to make final tweeks. So once the money has  been raised I can get straight into the studio. Recording, mixin, mastering and then printing materials and duplicating CDs.  I envisage this taking around 3 months to do it properly. With any luck you'll have a great new rock n roll  album in your hands before the end of the year.
 

What I Need & What You Get
So, I have put on my business head (yes I suppose having a day job did have its uses) and I have crunched the figures and decided I need another £750 all in to get the job done (I have already had some generous donations, many thanks to those people). This includes recording, printing, photos, artwork.... The whole thing. If we can raise more than this I can look at more studio time, currently I plan on spending 2 full days in the studio which is not long in album terms but, if Led Zepplin can do it then so can I! Any extra money raised will be spent on studio time and promotional material. 
On the flip side, if I don't reach the target the show will still go on. I will do more shows, busk, whatever it takes to get the money together, it might just take a little while longer to get the record out there. 
I have put together some cool ""packages"" for you to buy! 
Millennial - Download of the album/ demos
Casual Fan - CD and Poster
Retro - Cassette (yes we are putting the album on cassette) Poster, Demos
Guru - CD, Demos, Lyric Sheet
Collectors - Everything and more!! CD, Cassette, Demos, Poster, Lyric Sheet, and anything else I have to hand.
Of course your can just buy the CD if that's what you want.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Whether you can contribute or not I need your help to get the word out there about the album  and what I am trying to do. So please share on social media, tell your mates! To help you there are some share tools right here on Indiegogo.
Thanks for your support!

<p>After 25 years of playing in symphony orchestras, in April 2016 I began working fulltime on composing, performing and publishing my own compositions.  I am currently building up my portfolio of original music.  I hope that audiences will enjoy experiencing these compositions and that other musicians will enjoy playing them.  In the last two years I have had several interesting commissions.  One piece, which is called <i>Sonaquifer: Flowing-Turning Dance</i>, was commissioned  by cellist Hannah Addario-Berry, who  recorded it for her 2016 album, <i>Scordatura</i>.  I kept writing more material, and the piece became a full suite of four movements.  <i>Sonaquifer Suite </i>can be played on either cello or viola.  You may have heard me perform the viola version at a San Francisco recital, house concert, dance community campout, or Burning Man.  </p>
<p>It is now time to make a professional studio recording and to publish the sheet music for <i>Sonaquifer Suite</i>, as well as another piece called <i>Reflections</i>, for Baritone Viola (formerly called <i>Piece in G - </i>the piece with the plucking like a classical guitar.) Recording and publishing will enable me to share these pieces with listeners and musicians all over the world.</p>
<p>On Nov. 17 and 18, 2017, I recorded at Laughing Tiger Studio in San Rafael, California, with the assistance of David Bowles, a renowned sound engineer and producer who has worked with many top classical artists.  Contributions to this campaign will help to cover the costs of the studio, the engineer, and CD production.  We are making physical CDs, because they are still good to have on hand to offer at shows, and some people still like having physical recorded objects.  The album will also be available for streaming and distributed digitally.</p>
<p>The scores are ready to publish as both downloadable PDFs and paper booklets.  I will have covers for the booklets professionally printed, and I will print the contents and assemble the booklets myself.  This way I can make booklets as they are needed and will have the ability to make corrections if needed.</p>
<p>Contributions will also help defray the high costs of advertising in print and online publications.  I will also take advantage of many opportunities to publicize my music for free online.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My goal for this campaign is $8500.  If this is reached it will allow me to do all of the things mentioned above.  If is not reached, I will still make the recording and publish the scores, but </span>my advertising strategy might need to be modified.  If the goal is exceeded, funds will go toward getting the word out even more.  This recording project will represent my work in the world, which will help me to gain paid commissions for future projects, and this will in turn help me to continue to produce original music to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>People have told me that my music touches them emotionally and takes them on a journey.  When this happens, I feel that I'm doing my job as a musician.  In this way I am traditional, although I do love experimenting with unusual tunings, techniques and technoloigical  possibilities.  In the process of writing Sonaquifer, I came to terms with some self-doubt about whether my music is ""modern enough,"" since I still use old-fashioned ideas like melody, harmony, and recognizable rhythms.  (Yes, these are considered old-fashioned by some!)  My conclusion is that there is a common ground of musical language which speaks to and brings joy to many people, and I love being a channel for musical communication.</p>
<p>Would you consider making a donation to help me share this music with an international audience?  If you can donate, thank you so much!!!</p>

<h3>Why a ""samba"" metronome?</h3>
<p>There are no two ways about it: <strong>Practicing music with a metronome is essential to develop and improve your sense of rhythm.</strong> But is also soooo frustrating!</p>
<p>Brazilian musician and SambApp co-creator <strong>Pablo Regis</strong> wanted an organic way of practicing Brazilian musical genres. He wondered, “Instead of a traditional metronome, what if I had a portable percussionist in my back pocket to accompany me during those moments when I need a steady groove for practice or at live performances? <strong>Why isn’t there an 'App for That’?”</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467055662/ffgjtbzqteqcgbdzpoaa.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>So, Pablo teamed up with his partner, <strong>Kate Spanos</strong>, a dancer and web developer, to develop a ""samba metrnome app."" Over the following year, the two of them toiled away to make the app a reality. With the help of friend <strong>Steve Sachse</strong>, a talented musician and sound engineer, they created the first successful prototype, <strong>SambApp 1.0</strong>. Pablo played each instrument and rhythm, Kate designed the interface and programmed the app code for iPhone, and Steve recorded the instruments and meticulously edited the sound files. The team spent hours upon hours in Steve's home studio, <strong>creating loops</strong> of the various rhythm clips and equalizing the recordings for optimal sound quality.</p>

<h3>SambApp 2.0</h3>
<p>We released SambApp 1.0 in December 2015. While we were happy with the results of the initial launch (and we are grateful to the friends who downloaded the app from the iTunes store), we have a lot of ideas for improvements. We learned a lot during the first attempt, and now we want to <strong>take SambApp to the next level</strong> and offer the app to a wider audience.</p>
<p>For <strong>SambApp 2.0</strong>, master percussionist and drummer <strong>Scott Kettner</strong>, bandleader of <a href=""http://www.nationbeat.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nation Beat</a> and creator of <a href=""http://worlddrumlessons.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">World Drum Lessons.com</a>, will perform and manage music production and guest artist performances.</p>
<p>With <strong>interface upgrades, additional functionality, and improved sound quality</strong>, we will deliver an easy-to-use, professional sounding rhythm tool to Brazilian musicians and music fans all over the world. In the future, we want to <strong>expand this model</strong> to other traditional music styles, starting with rhythms and instruments from <strong>traditional Irish music, Latin American and Caribbean genres, and West African traditions</strong>, and then branching out to even more rhythmic styles.</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating a more <strong>polished, professional</strong> <strong>look</strong>;</li>
<li>Developing an <strong>Android</strong> version of the app (in response to many requests!) to expand SambApp's reach;</li>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The idea is simple, but a percussion metronome is game-changing.</strong></p>
<p>Anecdotal feedback is overwhelmingly exciting.  Musician and dancer friends agree that SambApp would transform their practice and performance experiences. People are already using SambApp 1.0 and they are eager for more innovative features and improvements.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>We know what people want and need in their metronome.</strong></p>
<p>SambApp will help you hone your skills with practice tools that help you learn the swing of Brazilian music and dance. The swing and ""feel"" of the rhythms are embedded in the loops as they are played on real instruments by professional musicians, and that<strong> human element</strong> will help you better connect to the music. Taking SambApp as a model, we also plan to expand to other cultural music forms in the future.</p>
<p>While SambApp does not replace a real percussionist, it is a reliable enhancement tool for any practice session or live performance. SambApp is invaluable for musicians and percussionists, who can rely on its steady beat while they improvise and create variations on top of that basic rhythm.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Support SambApp 2.0 and see how far we can take this.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We learned from our many mistakes as we developed SambApp 1.0, and we feel confident in our new plan to move forward.</p>
<p>We already have a design team and sound team waiting for the funds to upgrade the design interface and sound looping of our app. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>We estimate the project to take 10-12 months, with a projected launch date of January 2019.</strong></p>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal, we will leverage your contributions to find corporate and private sponsors, as well as arts-funding organizations to complete the necessary funding. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We welcome any level of financial contribution, but your support of our fund-raising campaign can also be powerful in other ways:</p>

<strong>Tell your friends!</strong> Share on social media! Write a song about it!</li>

<h3>Who's Clara? What's Mayday? Are we sinking!?!? </h3>
<p>Me! The Album! I certainly hope not, and especially not if we are all on board!! </p>
<p><strong>about the clara delfina: </strong></p>
<p>I was born 7 feet tall, eating nothing but avocado and breathing nothing but music. As I grew from a sapling into an Elephant I started to travel. What began as a voyage through classical music, turned into a dance with the devil. As an angsty teen I got dragged down into the current of Irish music, then bluegrass, and finally (after years of telling my father to turn off his horribly scratchy field recordings) Old-Time. It was always there, at square dances, on the radio, in the old Ballads that he sang me to sleep with. It snuck into the different little songs and melodies I'd write. But I've been pretty head over heels, ever since I accidentally stuck my toe into the cold, dark, depths of traditional music. So here I am, 21, recording some sweet ballads and killer tunes, ready to party, and ready to cry! JOIN ME :D</p>
<p><strong>about the album:</strong></p>
<p>We recorded Mayday in Floyd, VA at studio 808A with Joe Dejarnette behind the sound board. Haakon Oyen, Landon George, and Jake Blount join me for a selection of stringband tunes and ballads. </p>
<p>Mayday traditionally  marked the day that people would chase away winter and welcome spring. It's international workers day, it's a way of asking for help, and collectively, it's a symbol of hope.</p>
<p>I always knew I wanted my first album to pay tribute to the music from my grandmother. She grew up in New York, but the songs she learned from her mother traveled all the way from the Missouri Ozarks. After I finished up touring the UK as an old time duo (with welsh old-time player Ben Mcmanus) last spring, I decided it was finally time to embark on my first solo album- exploring the music of my family's past, while exploring what music means today and tomorrow. My grandmother's death in the summer,  fuelled the ready budding inspiration of exploring the way loss, death, and the past, influence love, life and the future. It's partially a dedication, and partially an exploration of community music and the way it helps bind people through troubled times, reminding people that winter always makes way for spring, and it's time to Welcome in the  May! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey there! I’m ZANDRA, a singer/songwriter based in Austin, Texas. I was raised in Houston where my father, a musician turned Episcopalian Priest instilled a love and appreciation of music in me. Every day on the way to school he would give my two little sisters and I musical lessons on everything from New Wave to Reggae. I started training and performing as a singer when I was a very little girl. I was the kid who always took choir and church solos WAY too seriously. I got very involved in musical theatre at age 7 and last summer I had the incredible opportunity to play Roxie Hart in “Chicago” the musical.</p>
<p>I wrote music as a little girl and quit for many years only out of a lack of believe in myself. I picked it back up in the summer of 2016 after returning from residential treatment for PTSD and exiting a very serious relationship. My entire world and identity felt like it had been ripped out from underneath me as I came to terms with the abuse in my childhood, a miscarriage I suffered and tried to stuff down and the collapse of a relationship that I thought was indestructible.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hey there! I’m ZANDRA, a singer/songwriter based in Austin, Texas. I was raised in Houston where my father, a musician turned Episcopalian Priest instilled a love and appreciation of music in me. Every day on the way to school he would give my two little sisters and I musical lessons on everything from New Wave to Reggae. I started training and performing as a singer when I was a very little girl. I was the kid who always took choir and church solos WAY too seriously. I got very involved in musical theatre at age 7 and last summer I had the incredible opportunity to play Roxie Hart in “Chicago” the musical.
I wrote music as a little girl and quit for many years only out of a lack of believe in myself. I picked it back up in the summer of 2016 after returning from residential treatment for PTSD and exiting a very serious relationship. My entire world and identity felt like it had been ripped out from underneath me as I came to terms with the abuse in my childhood, a miscarriage I suffered and tried to stuff down and the collapse of a relationship that I thought was indestructible. I was so raw and full of emotion that I couldn’t help but start writing again. But this time I was able to see the beauty in my art and have decided to pursue it full force!
I've fully funded the record up to this point. I'm working 3+ jobs in addition to working on the record and I can only do so much. I really need your support to propel this dream into reality. 
This record is about love, lust, loss, finding your strength, breaking addictive cycles and celebration of freedom. I really believe in the music on this record. I believe in it’s ability to make you dance, get stuck in your head, make you think, allow you the space to grieve and empower you to feel strong and fabulous.
This has always been my biggest dream in life. With your help we are making it a reality and giving me the backing to get my music career started off strong! Your generosity and support truly means the world to me and I am incredibly grateful.

<h3>Why the need for The Big WOW?</h3>
<p>In an ever changing society, with rents and property prices increasing everywhere, it's getting harder for creative people to find and use spaces needed to facilitate the production of new music.  This campaign is about helping us renovate a new space in Sheffield to do just that.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are a big group of musicians and friends who love everything about music</li>
<li>We bring collectively, decades of live music experience, from places like Club 60</li>
<li>We need help renovating this new space to help us rehearse, record &amp; perform music</li>
<li>Help us to help others record or perform music in Sheffield</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an opportunity to help us achieve that goal - it's what we like to do!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How can you help us?</h3>
<p>People power and our time is not a problem - we are a big team with lot's of helpers! </p>
<p>Our biggest hurdle is paying for building materials, a lot of which are specialist and therefore expensive.</p>
<p>We have already raised &amp; invested about 25% of the funds required to complete this project, enough to allow us to start the renovation process.   People's generosity and time means we  already raised money and built a new floor - that alone cost £2500 just in materials!  Putting a heating system in cost us £1500 - again, not including the people time needed to intsall.</p>
<p>Big space = Big costs</p>
<p>Here is the most important thing we need help with financing though...</p>
<h3>Sound proofing!</h3>
<p>(This is our most expensive hurdle to overcome)</p>
<p>Making &amp; playing music has a side product of noise.  Because we are developing this old workshop in an area of Sheffield that is also seeing residential properties being built, we have to make sure that everybody is happy!  We anticipate that this alone is nearly 60-70% of our required total.</p>
<p>In order to do this we have to invest in</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional floating sound boarding</li>
<li>Double glazed glass units for the windows</li>
<li>Birch-wood window shutters, providing additional insulation and security</li>
<li>Proper sound-proofed doors</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>And other things...</h3>
<p>We need help with some other items too - not quite as important, but still needed.  </p>
<p>(By that we mean if we don't hit our target it's not the end of the world, they will just have to come later rather than sooner, but it would be really helpful to us now if we could also raise funds to get these installed as soon as possible!)</p>
<ul>
<li>All doors to be ""uber"" fire exits (and not just ""normal"" doors)</li>
<li>Brand new electrics throughout (including nice mood lighting)</li>
<li>Fully clean, restore and seal all metal-work to preserve the industrial heritage</li>
<li>A nice new toilet (everybody loves a prisitne loo!)</li>
<li>Nice new kitchen area too - cuppa anyone?</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What it means to us</h3>
<p>It's not everyday a new opportunity arises to work on such an exciting venture.  Here are a  few reasons why we are motivated to spend so much time and effort and why we are asking for your finacial help...</p>
<ul>
<li>we believe new music is always needed - this space will help bring that</li>
<li>our shared experinces and history of Club60 brought to a new space</li>
<li>help keep Sheffield's only analogue recording studio housed and functioning</li>
<li>a place to host events that are truely supportive for artists</li>
</ul>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>And a great big thank you xxxx</h3>
<p>Regardless, we are so grateful for your contributions to The Big WOW. Even the smallest of donations can help and we apprecaite every penny and pound we recieve.  If you are unable to support us financially at this time you can instead share this campaign with your friends and family.

<p>I'm Su and I play banjo and fiddle! </p>
<p>Its really about time I got a descent fiddle for the gigs and sessions I play in!! </p>
<p>I bought a fiddle on eBay as a restoration project and found that it is a VERY nice fiddle that I could only do so much to restore it and also with help from friends to work on it too. But it needs expert attention for it to be fully playable. </p>
<p>The fiddle is now with the surgeon and it'll be due early Feb hopefully in time for the FOAOTMAD Festival in Gainsborough!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please help contribute toward this lovely fiddle.</p>
<p>It is a copy of a Hopf made in Germany, early 20th century.</p>
<p>I strung it up for a few sessions and one gig and many have said it sounds a lot better! It is a beautiful thing and I look forward to playing more tunes on it.</p>

<h3>Story of Jaymison</h3>
<p>Jaymison began in late 2016. What started out as a hangout with my friends Dan and Taylor turned into something I've now enjoyed for years. I named my project 'Jaymison' after a kid I've known for a while who lives in a low income area in Tennessee. The whole point of continuing and doing this project is to tell stories, whether they be mine or someone else's.</p>

<h3>Yellow Squash</h3>
<p>After moving up north and not doing music at any capacity life kind of found me in a position where things were pretty good. But, as it usually goes with life, things went in a different direction both with relationships and goals in life. On a whim I decided to record with someone a good friend recommended. Me and (now great friend) Chris Riley tracked 5 songs in June of this year. </p>

<p>Once it was out for a week or so I found out that Spotify got a hold of it and put it on their ""Fresh Finds"" playlist as well as some other of their own curated playlists. It was weird and strange, I ended up getting emails, texts from folks who enjoyed the song. Even had a small label in Europe ask if they could re-distribute the song.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Calmate</h3>
<p>The cool thing is that before and after releasing the song I've been able to write almost 25 other songs.  A lot of these songs come from a similar place like Yellow Squash does. Most of them are written with a common theme. The over-arching theme is being calm and collected in the storm. With that being said, the album title is called Calmate....which is Spanish simply means to ""calm one's self"".</p>
</div><div>
<h3>HLP (plz if u can)</h3>
<p>To be transparent, it costs a good amount of money to make a decent-sounding album. So instead of being a quiet guy and just tracking the dang thing I'm in need of some help - your GUYS' help. </p>
<p>I'm stoked because I've gotta pretty good feeling that these songs have a capacity to not just sound BANGIN' but for them to also gain some traction.</p>
<p>If you're still reading this then coolio! Look to the right side and see if one of these donation packages fits your budget and also gives you something you'd either wear or listen to.</p>

</div></div>","Story of Jaymison
Jaymison began in late 2016. What started out as a hangout with my friends Dan and Taylor turned into something I've now enjoyed for years. I named my project 'Jaymison' after a kid I've known for a while who lives in a low income area in Tennessee. The whole point of continuing and doing this project is to tell stories, whether they be mine or someone else's.

Yellow Squash
After moving up north and not doing music at any capacity life kind of found me in a position where things were pretty good. But, as it usually goes with life, things went in a different direction both with relationships and goals in life. On a whim I decided to record with someone a good friend recommended. Me and (now great friend) Chris Riley tracked 5 songs in June of this year. 
After listening to what we tracked I choose to put out this song called ""Yellow Squash"". 

Once it was out for a week or so I found out that Spotify got a hold of it and put it on their ""Fresh Finds"" playlist as well as some other of their own curated playlists. It was weird and strange, I ended up getting emails, texts from folks who enjoyed the song. Even had a small label in Europe ask if they could re-distribute the song.

<p><strong>Who am I ?</strong> </p>
<p>I am Scalawag, or more commonly known as Teo</p>
<p>I've been playing and writing music with different bands around Smithers and Vancouver for the past five years. I'm an actor, dancer, and musician. It's time to embark on this project of releasing my first album of solo material.  But I need your help!</p>

<p><strong>What do I need? and why...</strong></p>
<p>$2500 may seem like a lot to record and produce an album, but it's actually the opposite. Because I've recorded the entire album myself, with the help of my closest friend Zak, I've saved tremendous amounts of money that would have been spent on studio time and hiring an engineer/producer. For a full length album, $2500 is actually a very reasonable price to be able to print an entire run of albums, and pay the artists who created designed the album artwork, which at this point, is all I need.</p>
<p>$1400 will go towards the actual physical printing of 250 CDs in gorgeous full colour cases with a book insert. </p>
<p>$90 is what I will need to distribute our song onto iTunes, Amazon and CD baby in order for online downloads of the album to be possible. (it will also be available on Bandcamp) </p>
<p>$125 (5%) will go to Indiegogo for the fee of using their amazing service</p>
<p>$75 (3%) is the fee for using PayPal or Credit cards to accept backing donations. </p>
<p>$200 is what I need to put on a rocking album release party and distribute all of the albums and swag to their deserving owners. </p>
<p>$440 is what I have agreed to pay the artist of the album artwork (Emerenne Saefkow)</p>
<p>$250 is what I have agreed to pay the Designer of the album artwork (Hans Saefkow)</p>
<p>Any funds I raise above our goal will go towards creating Music Videos, as well as funding more creative projects!</p>
<p>Independently producing an album is in my opinion the best way to record an album. Recording usually takes a lot of money and a lot of communication. apart from exhausting nights being cooped up alone hitting record over and over again until it sounds perfect, recording it myself has eliminated the large budget that I would have needed to fund such a project, and given me total creative control. I am simply getting by with a little help from my friends, and the occasional late night jam sessions to keep me sane. </p>
<p><strong>Perks, oh the perks!</strong></p>
<p>Alongside the invaluable experience of backing an independent project and helping me get my feet on the ground, we also have some sweet sweet perks that will give you even more satisfaction from helping us out. </p>
<p>With my perk system based off different levels of civil disobedience, you will receive a wide variety of goodies. From a digital download of the album a week before everyone else, to an entire concept album written about you, whether you want to be a follower, a Traitor, or even a Scalawag yourself, every little bit helps tremendously to make this dream a reality!</p>
<p>Even if you can't contribute money, you can still help me out!</p>
<p>I understand that not everybody is able to help out monetarily, but you can still help me make this project a success! help me out by sharing this indiegogo page, (they make it really easy by having buttons up at the top of this page) or by telling your friends about this project, and I will be tremendously thankful! </p>

<p>YOU helped to fund <strong>‘sings The Bodysnatchers’</strong>, the <i>lost</i> 2 Tone album of tracks we played live, but never recorded for release! It was a great success and we are still very happy with the resulting CD and vinyl LP.</p>
<p>Then, YOU took a chance on funding an EP, not knowing what it would contain, in a musical sense, but YOU trusted us and we delivered! <strong>‘The LoTek Four, Vol I’</strong> was released fully earlier this year on limited edition CD and 7” vinyl EP. Nearly sold out now, it has been very well received, especially by our live audience.</p>
<p>Now, we are asking YOU again. Will YOU trust us once more? <strong>‘The LoTek Four, Vol II’</strong> is waiting to be laid down for your listening pleasure. We may have played at least one of the tracks live and it/they may have gone down very well. For those of YOU having faith in us, there will be a free bonus track!</p>
<p>My name is <strong>Rhoda Dakar</strong> and I started my musical career in all-female 2Tone band, <strong>The Bodysnatchers</strong>. I went on to perform with <strong>The Specials</strong> and was a member of <strong>The Special AKA</strong>, who released 'The Boiler', a tale of date rape before there was a term for it, and 'Free Nelson Mandela'. I have continued my association with the former 2 Tone alumni, guesting on vocals with <strong>Madness</strong>' 'On The Town', from 'The Liberty Of Norton Folgate', and tour DJ for The Specials' UK tour, joining them on vocals for the encore.

<h3>BIO</h3>
<p>KYRIE’s swerving through these L.A. streets with a Baltimore mentality and edgy style. Since the age of 9, KYRIE has been writing her own lyrics and performing in front of a live audience every chance she gets. As “KYRIE”, she has since performed at the AFRAM Festival, on the Apollo Theater stage twice, auditioned for multiple rounds of the hit show “X Factor USA”, and independently released tracks such as “Bring Me Down” and “Curry"", which followed up with a video that was written about by Revolt TV and Dunk 360. ""I've wanted this since I was 7 years old,"" says KYRIE. ""I moved on my own at 18 to a completely different coast just to make sure this career happens for me."" With the release of her latest freestyle ""Sriracha"" and her upcoming festival performances, KYRIE is definitely one to watch. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Originally from Chicago, I have been developing my craft for the last 10 years. I've lead an adventurous life, living in NYC, Oakland, LA and now Atlanta. All of these turns have led me to ""Blood"", my next EP. In contrast to my previous folk-driven EP, ""Blood"" is pop-driven with songs about survival and womanhood. My goal is to have it recorded by the fall of 2018 with 4-8 songs, shoot a video and promote the content.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Sat nam, I am a Kundalini Yoga Teacher and Musician based in the United Kingdom. I teach locally and sing meditation music with my family in the UK and throughout Europe by invitation from other yogis. </p>
<p>So far we have made five albums on very tight budgets with the generous and professional assistance of local friends. People have described the music as inspirational and luminous, as well as healing and beautiful. It is sold via Spirit Voyage, Sat Nam Versand and i-Tunes. Many people have been in touch to say they used the music to help deal with sadness, illness or grief or to uplift them in their daily lives. But this is a niche market and very often people download their music from Spotify which doesn't pay back the artist or support them to create new work. </p>

Sat nam, I am a Kundalini Yoga Teacher and Musician based in the United Kingdom. I teach locally and sing meditation music with my family in the UK and throughout Europe by invitation from other yogis. 
So far we have made five albums on very tight budgets with the generous and professional assistance of local friends. People have described the music as inspirational and luminous, as well as healing and beautiful. It is sold via Spirit Voyage, Sat Nam Versand and i-Tunes. Many people have been in touch to say they used the music to help deal with sadness, illness or grief or to uplift them in their daily lives. But this is a niche market and very often people download their music from Spotify which doesn't pay back the artist or support them to create new work. 
We feel that this music is needed in the World to bring in more light during challenging and troubled times. Additionally, we create and sing music with our family; our three sons sing with us and play various instruments, creating a family and community style harmony wherever we go, which is very healing for people who've not experienced positive family situations. 
So we need to make this album and we need to go deeper into the vibration of love to do it! We will be paying an experienced Kirtan producer to mix and edit this album, as well as to record additional musicians to play on the album with us. 
The budget for recording, paying musicians, mastering, editing and mixing is £4,000
The budget for printing and distribution is £1,000
Whatever we manage to raise on top of this will help us pay for the crowdfunding fees and also can pay towards some marketing of the CD. 
We would be so grateful if you could support us by pre purchasing the album, or by paying to invite us to come and sing with you. All money will go directly into the CD fund to pay those who are helping us create it! 
If we don't reach our goal, then all money raised will go directly into the CD production, we will just have to find other ways to raise the rest! But we will make this CD, we have a great track record of our commitment to getting this music recorded and out into the World!

So I chose to focus on a small instrument---the ukulele. Gondolele: Buoyant Ukulele Music stands fully recorded. Every second of audio critically selected over a 2+ year time period. Each song has been mixed down to stereo wave files and digitally mastered for high quality audio playback. On this album you will discover fifteen studio recorded songs, each containing a minimum of vocals, ukulele, and bass, while most tracks additionally include a mixture of the following recorded instruments: acoustic guitar, marimba, glockenspiel, harmonica, piano, lead guitar, harmony vocals, and hand percussion.</p><p>Gondolele's style of music is exuberant, playful, and pulsing with imaginative ideas. The songs appeal to persons of every generation, but seeing as how the ukulele attracts attention from many youngsters, I designed the album to be family friendly from beginning to end.

It's been a labor of love and a critical step for me to take in order to move forward in the realm of music making. Stretching and growing, testing myself, pushing my limits, struggling, failing, learning, resting, adapting, and moving on, have all been key components in this creative process. After spending so much time carefully listening to the audio again and again during the engineering and mastering stages of this album, I will never again be able to use my old ears to listen to recorded music as before; because now they pick out nuances as if they were ears of an engineer, noting the sounds by what it takes to create them! Besides the aforementioned investment of personal time, the following financial investments have already been made: Total Expenses for Studio Recording, Mixing, and Mastering: = $3,750. Total Costs of Collaborating with Local Artists for album cover design and creation of indie-gogo campaign video: = $800</p><p>It is in this final phase I hope to muster financial support to cover the sum of $2200 to have the disc manufacturing company press the album onto compact discs. This sum includes the replication of a glass master, one thousand cds in full color packages of matte finish paper-board, a twelve page booklet of visual artwork by yours truly, and song lyrics too.

 singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalistself-taught musician, aspiring jazz guitaristprivate music lessons provider,experimenter in audio production,                contributing live music to local and regional events at: farmers markets, libraries, music festivals, skill share workshops, open mic performances, social awareness programs,educational background in agriculture and writing,professional gardener, botanist in training,believer in the transformational power of art and wild natural spaces When I began thinking about this solo album project, I knew that I wanted to start small. So I chose to focus on a small instrument---the ukulele. Gondolele: Buoyant Ukulele Music stands fully recorded. Every second of audio critically selected over a 2+ year time period. Each song has been mixed down to stereo wave files and digitally mastered for high quality audio playback. On this album you will discover fifteen studio recorded songs, each containing a minimum of vocals, ukulele, and bass, while most tracks additionally include a mixture of the following recorded instruments: acoustic guitar, marimba, glockenspiel, harmonica, piano, lead guitar, harmony vocals, and hand percussion.Gondolele's style of music is exuberant, playful, and pulsing with imaginative ideas. The songs appeal to persons of every generation, but seeing as how the ukulele attracts attention from many youngsters, I designed the album to be family friendly from beginning to end. By clicking the pink button above you're contributing towards substantial art that will stimulate and nourish the mind.                                     Give and TakeI will not try to calculate the triple-digit number of hours that went into the making of Gondolele: Buoyant Ukulele Music. It's been a labor of love and a critical step for me to take in order to move forward in the realm of music making. Stretching and growing, testing myself, pushing my limits, struggling, failing, learning, resting, adapting, and moving on, have all been key components in this creative process. After spending so much time carefully listening to the audio again and again during the engineering and mastering stages of this album, I will never again be able to use my old ears to listen to recorded music as before; because now they pick out nuances as if they were ears of an engineer, noting the sounds by what it takes to create them! Besides the aforementioned investment of personal time, the following financial investments have already been made: Total Expenses for Studio Recording, Mixing, and Mastering: = $3,750. Total Costs of Collaborating with Local Artists for album cover design and creation of indie-gogo campaign video: = $800It is in this final phase I hope to muster financial support to cover the sum of $2200 to have the disc manufacturing company press the album onto compact discs. This sum includes the replication of a glass master, one thousand cds in full color packages of matte finish paper-board, a twelve page booklet of visual artwork by yours truly, and song lyrics too. You are going to receive many rewards for adding your contribution to the completion of this project!

<p>My name is <a href=""http://www.moodykablawi.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Moody Kablawi</a>, I’m a Rapper, music producer and lighting designer born and raised in Haifa City.

<p>At the age of 15 I released my first HipHop EP and started touring with several<br/>ensembles and projects that slowly brought me into producing my own music.</p>
<p>In 2017, I released my second Trip-Hop album followed by several music videos including:</p>

<p>In the past year I have been working on developing my sound as a producer and as a MC, finding myself diving deep into the sound of Disco, Electro , Retro and Funk while touching a lot of Middle eastern elements.</p>

<h3>Bref résumé</h3>
<p>Je suis musicien professionnel spécialisé en interprétation de la musique ancienne sur les instruments à cordes pincées. Depuis plus de vingt ans, je m’attache au répertoire pour guitare baroque, tant en solo qu’en ensembles. J’ai joué sur plusieurs excellents instruments fabriqués à partir de modèles de guitares du 17e siècle. J’ai toujours rêvé de jouer sur un instrument original, mais ils sont extrêmement rares et la plupart sont exposés dans des musées.</p>
<p>J’ai récemment eu l’occasion de faire l’acquisition d’une de ces guitares auprès des réputés restaurateurs d’instruments Daniel et Françoise Sinier de Ridder, à Paris. L’instrument, d’une grande valeur patrimoniale et historique, est donc en parfait état de restauration, prêt à jouer. </p>

<p>Grâce à votre contribution, je souhaite financer un tout premier enregistrement sur la guitare. Les fonds serviront aussi à l’entretien de cet instrument incroyable et à la production de 25 concerts un peu partout au Québec, dans le but de la mettre en valeur. Je souhaite que les gens puisse l’entendre, l’admirer! </p>
<p>En contrepartie d’un don de 25$ je vous offre l’enregistrement de plusieurs pièces de répertoire que je compte enregistrer à l’automne 2018 sur cette Voboam extraordinaire.</p>

<p>Agbara Estudio is a non-profit making organization dedicated to the teaching of Afro-Caribbean Dance, more specifically Salsa Dancing and other similar forms.  For the last two years we have organized a Salsa Festival. This festival includes workshops, conferences, dance shows and concerts. This year we have introduced an interschool dance exchange. Due to local regulations we are not allowed to charge anything to the students taking part, nor to the public watching the show. Therefore we totally depend on the generosity of any donors we can find.</p>
<p>Due to the high inflation in the country, hard currency goes a long way. So with your contribution, hopefully WE will go a long way too! The money will be used in the following-</p>
<p>-  Hiring the venue: Centro Cultural Tulio Febres Cordero in the Centre of Mérida City.</p>
<p>- Hiring the sound system for the show.</p>
<p>- Costumes for some of the students taking part.</p>
<p>- Hydration and a snack for the students, dancers and the musicians on the day of the concert.</p>
<p>- Transport and general expenses of the teachers doing the workshops.</p>
<p>- Prizes for the best groups in the show including annual scholarships in local dance schools.</p>
<p>- General logistics of the event.</p>
<p>This project is important because it is our mission to maintain and encourage the participation in and the enjoyment of traditional salsa dancing. We have promoted such ventures in the past but would like to expand the impact to a wider audience. Such activities are essential within a country experiencing severe economic difficulties. They help to promote a spirit of optimism where is sorely needed.  </p>

And it will be the 6th album that I have recorded. I am a jazz singer right along the lines of Ella Fitzgerald or Sarah Vaughn. We have taken all my favourite Christmas songs and set them with very jazzy arrangements  - some with string orchestra. </p><p> </p><p>It's a little different from the last release,  -<strong> Around About Midnight</strong> or <strong>Con Alma</strong> - <strong>A Tribute to Dizzy Gillespie.</strong> This time it is with a stronger entertaining, swinging  aspect with orchestra arrangements and with string quartet, arranged by Corey Allen with popular songs of the most beautiful Christmas songs  - some of them combined with traditional Christmas songs like <strong>Away In a Manger</strong> or <strong>O Little Town of Bethlehem.</strong></p><p> </p><p>This album is a dream I have had for years  and I'm very proud to present it to you.  I want to help you create in your home this Christmas a beautiful, cheery and harmonious atmosphere - spreading love, goodwill and peace in your family and also towards all people, regardless of religion, nationality or culture.</p><p> </p><p><u><strong>About Me</strong></u></p><h3>My name is Judy Rafat, born and raised in Canada - I lived most of that time in London, Ontario. I have been singing I think since I was born - sat with my grandfather on his knee as a small child to sing and finally studied voice - classical and jazz. I came to Germany after my studies with a rock group and toured Europe and ended up settling in Germany. I was a socially engaged folk singer singing for peace.</h3><h3> </h3><h3>I changed to jazz after hearing the first chords from Dizzy Gillespie on CON ALMA in 1986. Shortly after, I started my studies in Vocal Jazz. I was blessed to have Dizzy Gillespie as my mentor and had the marvelous opportunity to be on tour with him to Berlin, Prag and Moscow.</h3><h3>I then recorded a Tribute to him - CON ALMA - in New York with all the fabulous musicians that worked with Dizzy - <i><strong>Kenny Barron, Rufus Reid, Mike Longo, Frank Wess, Claudio Roditi, Paquito d`Rivera, and Ignacio Berroa. </strong></i>
</h3><p> </p><p>Up until now I have had an international career travelling to China, Singapore, Dubai, jazz clubs in Europe and  performances with Dave Brubeck in the Gerhard Mercator University and Wynton Marsalis in Shanghai was also a highlight in my career.</p><p> </p><h3><b><u>Concept and History</u></b></h3><p><i><u><strong>""It was the night before Christmas when all through the house</strong></u></i>......"" This CD has been a dream of mine for almost 3 years. The concept for the album was to record - a beautiful Christmas Album bringing people together in an atmosphere of love, good will, harmony in this cold world and a feeling of joy, excited children and belongingness in family and helping others less fortunate. </p><p> </p><p>I loved Christmas in Canada as a child,- the fantasy, make believe, the glistening snow  and sitting  in the middle of the night under the beautiful Christmas tree with it`s twinkling lights  waiting for Santa to wriggle down the chimney. The memories of the smell of cooking, baking, the precious stories - Scrooge and the poems and films - the decorations and the beautiful Christmas music have  always stayed in my mind. And most of all the beautiful atmosphere of love and family.</p><p> </p><p>After doing a concert with Corey Allen, 3 years ago, we discussed it and he offered to do the arrangements for the band and for the string orchestra. 1 1/2 years later we had the concept for the album - a beautiful Christmas Album was born.</p><p> </p><p>The songs of this album are some of my very favourite Christmas songs- most of them you have heard before but not with my voice or with these arrangements -  with soprano saxophone or clarinett or flute. And of course 4 of the tunes are with a string orchestra recorded in the Dominican Republic.</p><p> </p><p>I hope you love this album which I am sure you will, just as much as we enjoy recording and producing it. </p><p> </p><p><u><strong>The ""IT`S CHRISTMAS TIME AGAIN"" Tracklisting</strong></u></p><p>1.  It`s The Most Wonderful Time of the Year</p><p>2. Santa Baby</p><p>3. The Christmas Song</p><p>4. Winter Wonderland</p><p>5. It`s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas</p><p>6. O Little Town of Bethlehem</p><p>7. Away in A Manger</p><p>8. I`ll Be Home For Christmas</p><p>9. Let It Snow</p><p>10. Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas</p><p>11. Santa Claus Is Coming to Town</p><p> </p><p>-------------------------------------------------</p><h2><strong>Behind the Scenes &amp; Budget</strong></h2><h3><i>What does it take to make an album like this? Well, a lot.</i></h3><p>-<i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540301789/uezrousbt67qoylnibbc.jpg"" src=""""/></i>-</p><p>which amounts to about 15,000€ round about! </p><p>In this case, financially speaking, it takes even more than what this campaign goal is asking. Usually around 20 K€.</p><p>For those interested, a budget like this for a mid-level album is very common (often much more) and typically fronted by a band's label, which they have to pay back through album sales and touring. Nowadays, through streaming through Spotifiy, utube, Deezer and the many other platforms and easy illegal downloading, very little gets back to the musician.</p><p>I have decided to take the more challenging path of not signing to a label, and release my music independently under a proforma label: supermusic - they pay nothing and still get 30% of every sold CD.</p><p>That means I, alone, am responsible for funding my music, making every last detail come together, and promoting it.</p><p> </p><p><strong>But I've found the reward of ""doing it WITH my fans"" to be better than anything I could imagine. </strong></p><p> </p><p>It was an easy choice for me - there was no way I was going to sacrifice my music  because I am a jazz musician . So I decided to find ways to keep my music career sustainable  - and that means teaching voice, remaining a recording artist and to heavily involve my fans in the process of creating and promoting my album (<strong>that's YOU</strong>!). </p><p> </p><p>I am planning next year a Tribute to Dizzy Gillespie Tour and playing at a few jazz festivals and clubs.</p><p> </p><p>I love being transparent and want you to know the challenges I face as an independent musician, and that I take huge pride in the TOTALLY AMAZING SUPPORT jazz fans show. I think jazz fans are unlike any other fans in the entire musical genre landscape! <br/> </p><p>But not only that, I also feel incredibly inspired and lucky to have fans who have supported me in the past! YOU KEEP THE MUSIC ALIVE. </p><p><br/>Besides picking out  the songs and keys, there are many logistics, especially when you're creating a project which involves so many people in several different countries and time zones, all using different gear, recording equipment, and procedures. </p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><h2><u><strong>Musicians On This Album</strong></u></h2><p> </p><h3>JUDY RAFAT - Vocals</h3><h3><i>Location: Germany</i></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539789331/s1k6vxweoieggcvunvgz.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Lothar van Staa - </strong></h3><h3><strong>Tenor-, Sopran- Saxophone, Clarinett</strong></h3><h3><i><strong>Location: Germany</strong></i></h3><p>I have been working with Lothar since 2005 and he is such a talented, sensitive player and it is a joy for me to play with him - I feel that he feels everything I sing.

Keeping in constant contact with  contributors is tough, but throw in coordinating music, tracks, graphics, new mixes,  and you get Judy’s brand new album.</p><p>And it still doesn’t stop there. Beyond the album itself, there is this huge crowdfunding campaign to plan and execute! </p><p>There are lots of details to iron out, and tons of decisions to make. Part of my job is to organize the chaos and make sure all these items are taken care of.</p><p>There is a lot going on but it is very fun and rewarding to be a part of it all. Working for Judy is absolutely great because I get a very unique opportunity to work in the music industry in such an innovative way. Judy knows her stuff when it comes to singing, and it is really great to work with such a highly talented person. Her creative and visionary mindset creates a fresh atmosphere to work in, and that is something you need in any business for it to move forward and become successful.</p><p>I’m excited for this campaign and look forward to the album launch afterwards!</p><p>Let’s make sure it happens by reaching our goal.""</p><p>===============================&gt;&gt;</p><p> </p><p><strong><i>JUDY</i></strong> says......""Looking back over the past couple years, it's really amazing how this has all came together.

And it will be the 6th album that I have recorded. I am a jazz singer right along the lines of Ella Fitzgerald or Sarah Vaughn. We have taken all my favourite Christmas songs and set them with very jazzy arrangements  - some with string orchestra.  It's a little different from the last release,  - Around About Midnight or Con Alma - A Tribute to Dizzy Gillespie. This time it is with a stronger entertaining, swinging  aspect with orchestra arrangements and with string quartet, arranged by Corey Allen with popular songs of the most beautiful Christmas songs  - some of them combined with traditional Christmas songs like Away In a Manger or O Little Town of Bethlehem. This album is a dream I have had for years  and I'm very proud to present it to you.  I want to help you create in your home this Christmas a beautiful, cheery and harmonious atmosphere - spreading love, goodwill and peace in your family and also towards all people, regardless of religion, nationality or culture. About MeMy name is Judy Rafat, born and raised in Canada - I lived most of that time in London, Ontario. I have been singing I think since I was born - sat with my grandfather on his knee as a small child to sing and finally studied voice - classical and jazz. I came to Germany after my studies with a rock group and toured Europe and ended up settling in Germany. I was a socially engaged folk singer singing for peace. I changed to jazz after hearing the first chords from Dizzy Gillespie on CON ALMA in 1986. Shortly after, I started my studies in Vocal Jazz. I was blessed to have Dizzy Gillespie as my mentor and had the marvelous opportunity to be on tour with him to Berlin, Prag and Moscow.I then recorded a Tribute to him - CON ALMA - in New York with all the fabulous musicians that worked with Dizzy - Kenny Barron, Rufus Reid, Mike Longo, Frank Wess, Claudio Roditi, Paquito d`Rivera, and Ignacio Berroa. 
 Up until now I have had an international career travelling to China, Singapore, Dubai, jazz clubs in Europe and  performances with Dave Brubeck in the Gerhard Mercator University and Wynton Marsalis in Shanghai was also a highlight in my career. Concept and History""It was the night before Christmas when all through the house......"" This CD has been a dream of mine for almost 3 years. The concept for the album was to record - a beautiful Christmas Album bringing people together in an atmosphere of love, good will, harmony in this cold world and a feeling of joy, excited children and belongingness in family and helping others less fortunate.  I loved Christmas in Canada as a child,- the fantasy, make believe, the glistening snow  and sitting  in the middle of the night under the beautiful Christmas tree with it`s twinkling lights  waiting for Santa to wriggle down the chimney. The memories of the smell of cooking, baking, the precious stories - Scrooge and the poems and films - the decorations and the beautiful Christmas music have  always stayed in my mind. And most of all the beautiful atmosphere of love and family. After doing a concert with Corey Allen, 3 years ago, we discussed it and he offered to do the arrangements for the band and for the string orchestra. 1 1/2 years later we had the concept for the album - a beautiful Christmas Album was born. The songs of this album are some of my very favourite Christmas songs- most of them you have heard before but not with my voice or with these arrangements -  with soprano saxophone or clarinett or flute. And of course 4 of the tunes are with a string orchestra recorded in the Dominican Republic. I hope you love this album which I am sure you will, just as much as we enjoy recording and producing it.  The ""IT`S CHRISTMAS TIME AGAIN"" Tracklisting1.  It`s The Most Wonderful Time of the Year2. Santa Baby3. The Christmas Song4. Winter Wonderland5. It`s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas6. O Little Town of Bethlehem7. Away in A Manger8. I`ll Be Home For Christmas9. Let It Snow10. Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas11. Santa Claus Is Coming to Town -------------------------------------------------Behind the Scenes & BudgetWhat does it take to make an album like this? Well, a lot.--which amounts to about 15,000€ round about! In this case, financially speaking, it takes even more than what this campaign goal is asking. Usually around 20 K€.For those interested, a budget like this for a mid-level album is very common (often much more) and typically fronted by a band's label, which they have to pay back through album sales and touring. Nowadays, through streaming through Spotifiy, utube, Deezer and the many other platforms and easy illegal downloading, very little gets back to the musician.I have decided to take the more challenging path of not signing to a label, and release my music independently under a proforma label: supermusic - they pay nothing and still get 30% of every sold CD.That means I, alone, am responsible for funding my music, making every last detail come together, and promoting it. But I've found the reward of ""doing it WITH my fans"" to be better than anything I could imagine.  It was an easy choice for me - there was no way I was going to sacrifice my music  because I am a jazz musician . So I decided to find ways to keep my music career sustainable  - and that means teaching voice, remaining a recording artist and to heavily involve my fans in the process of creating and promoting my album (that's YOU!).  I am planning next year a Tribute to Dizzy Gillespie Tour and playing at a few jazz festivals and clubs. I love being transparent and want you to know the challenges I face as an independent musician, and that I take huge pride in the TOTALLY AMAZING SUPPORT jazz fans show. I think jazz fans are unlike any other fans in the entire musical genre landscape!  But not only that, I also feel incredibly inspired and lucky to have fans who have supported me in the past! YOU KEEP THE MUSIC ALIVE. Besides picking out  the songs and keys, there are many logistics, especially when you're creating a project which involves so many people in several different countries and time zones, all using different gear, recording equipment, and procedures. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Musicians On This Album JUDY RAFAT - VocalsLocation: Germany Lothar van Staa - Tenor-, Sopran- Saxophone, ClarinettLocation: GermanyI have been working with Lothar since 2005 and he is such a talented, sensitive player and it is a joy for me to play with him - I feel that he feels everything I sing. I just love the way he plays and am thrilled to have him on the album.  Markus Schieferdecker - BassLocation: GermanyI have been playing with Markus for many years, at least 10, and he is one of the most prolific bass players in Germany. It is always a pleasure to play with such a great bass player who is so loving and kind and funny. Great to have you on the album Markus!  Marcus Rieck - DrumsLocation: GermanyMarcus is an extremely delicate drummer and a master of the quieter playing - not ususal for drummers! that is why he is so special.Actually it was my luck to have Marcus on this album as the drummer that usually plays with me wasn`t available. But I am thrilled in how he harmonizes with the band. Really thrilled to have him on the CD.  Corey Allen - Piano and ArrangementsLocation: Los Angeles/Dominican RepublicCorey Allen from Los Angeles and now residing in Dominican Republc and who is head of the jazz Department at the University of Santo Domingo  has been a good friend of mine for many years. He wrote the arrangements  for the amazing  Manhattan Transfer and for many, many more musicians and has recorded over 30 albums. What an honour to have Corey on this album, - he is world renowned, first of all because of his unbelievable Piano playing but also because of his great ability to write fantastic arrangements which I am sure you will marvel on this album.    Other Contributors on this album Tom McCauley - Mixing/Mastering of the albumLocation:  Los AngelesTom McCauley has done with his exquiste taste, all the mixing for many famous jazz musicians such as Cheryl Bentyne  and now for me ... Reinhard Kobialka - Studio EngineerLocation: GermanyThis is my second album with Reihnhard in Topaz Studios in Cologne. I love the way Reinhard works - very precise and his taste is impeccable for the sound I like. Zoltan Leskovar/Dagmar Strohschen - PhotographersAll of the photos in the studio have been done by the amazing Zoltan Leskovar. And the cover Foto on the Album is from my wonderful friend and great photographer - Dagmar Strohschen Marcus Laghanke - Video EngineerAll of the beautiful videos done in this campaign were created by Marcus. So glad to have someone so capable of portraying me and my music. Veronika Caspers - Graphic Design of Cover Promotion Agent - King.ink Promotion Big THANK YOU to PAUL RUNGE for the financial logistics of this campaign Ralph :  Virtual AssistantLocation: Philippines""As Judy’s virtual marketing assistant, I see almost everything that goes on behind the scenes when it comes to her music , and wow there’s a lot going on!The biggest part of this album and crowdfunding campaign is the logistics. Keeping in constant contact with  contributors is tough, but throw in coordinating music, tracks, graphics, new mixes,  and you get Judy’s brand new album.And it still doesn’t stop there. Beyond the album itself, there is this huge crowdfunding campaign to plan and execute! There are lots of details to iron out, and tons of decisions to make. Part of my job is to organize the chaos and make sure all these items are taken care of.There is a lot going on but it is very fun and rewarding to be a part of it all. Working for Judy is absolutely great because I get a very unique opportunity to work in the music industry in such an innovative way. Judy knows her stuff when it comes to singing, and it is really great to work with such a highly talented person. Her creative and visionary mindset creates a fresh atmosphere to work in, and that is something you need in any business for it to move forward and become successful.I’m excited for this campaign and look forward to the album launch afterwards!Let’s make sure it happens by reaching our goal.""===============================>> JUDY says......""Looking back over the past couple years, it's really amazing how this has all came together. I've learned over the years that nothing of worth is ever easy.  This album is no different. Sometimes I reflect on where I was five years after the recording of my 5th Album  thinking, I never seem to give up hoping to find people who love what I do - SINGING JAZZ   -  I hope you will spread the news.Yet here we are... Sometimes you must pursue your dream no matter how much self-doubt we have. And on a funny note - Your involvement in making this album a success is also a nice sarcastic gesture to the labels  or people who have told me I wouldn't make it on my own, or that I can't be successful with jazz!  I would be absolutely honored if you decide to be a Judy Rafat supporter & help with the final completion of this album and its release very soon! If we don't make the goal, it means the album will still come out, but maybe not as far as we wanted. It depends how much promotion we will be able to do. ==========================> HOW YOU CAN BE INVOLVED: Bundle of Joy 1 (Download of the Album) Bundle of Joy 2 (Physical CD autographed €30)It`s Christmas Time Again Album  plus an autographed poster of me.  Bundle of Joy 3 (Physical CD autographed €50)Receive a Physical CD of Judy's (It's Christmas Time Again Album)with Autograph on the cover.Included items in this perk:1 T-shirt with Merry Christmas from Judy Rafat Bundle of Joy 4 (3 CD`s €75) Receive a combination of 3 of Judy`s albums.  First the beautiful Christmas CD                                                          + Digital Download of Con Alma - Tribute to Dizzy Gillespie album                                                         +Digital Download of Pure Inspiration Album of Judy`s amazing Band Bundle of Joy 5 (Two CD´s + 1 t-shirt +1 mug €100)Receive  One Physical CD and one download  of Judy's (It's Christmas Time Again Album)with Autograph on the cover.

<h3>Hey there! Hentaii here.</h3>
<p>I'm an Austin, TX artist, drag queen, and now, musician. I get excited just typing that. Releasing music has been a dream of mine since I started experimenting with making electronic music as a teenager, but aside from a few song demos I released to Soundcloud in 2015, I lacked the confidence to ever pursue a fully-realized release.</p>
<p>I've spent the last three years performing around Austin and central Texas as Hentaii, my drag persona, and I couldn't have asked for a better confidence boost. The things I used to hate about myself, like my body and femininity, have come to be the things people have embraced me for, and more importantly, the things I have come to love about myself. I finally feel like I'm ready to pursue my bigger dreams as a musician and an artist. But, I need your help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>At this point, the EP is fully written, composed, and recorded. We need your help to finish the mixing, mastering, and commercial release of the EP.</p>
<ul>
<li>$250 will pay the remainder of producer Joe Stacey's labor costs for mixing, mastering, and finishing the album. Trust me when I say, this project has been a labor of love for both myself AND Joe. This amount is far lower than what he deserves for the amount of work he's put in already.</li>
<li>$500 will go toward funding the promotional release of the EP, paying for Instagram, Facebook, and print ads as well as the distribution fees. I am releasing this EP as an independent artist (no label).</li>
<li>$1000 will go toward funding the second music video off the EP, following the release of Magnetic.</li>
<li>Approximately half of the funds we raise will go toward printing and shipping the Magnetic Hentaii shirts, which are the main perk for this campaign! These shirts aren't a way for me to profit off of my music, or even a way to make back the money I've spent thus far. They are an incentive to help fund the future of this project, and 100% of the money made will go toward funding the project.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>How can you support the EP?</strong></h3>
<p>I'm essentially using this campaign as a place to pre-order the EP, purchase the first single, Magnetic, as well as a place to purchase the Magnetic Hentaii T-shirt.</p>
<p>If I don't reach 100% of the goal, you will still receive your T-shirt and downloads, and I will compromise on advertising, promotion, and music video costs.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$1 contributions</strong> will grant you an immediate download of the first single from the EP, Magnetic.</li>
<li>
<strong>$5 contributions</strong> will grant you an immediate download of the first single from the EP, Magnetic, as well as a download of the full EP when it releases this summer.</li>
<li>
<strong>$25 contributions</strong> will grant you the above perks, as well as the exclusive Magnetic Hentaii T-shirt, designed by my friend HadesIllustration. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/hadesillustration/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/hadesillustration/</a> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why support THIS music project?</h3>
<p>This EP is an opportunity to help expand the pathways for what it means to be a drag artist. Right now, the options available boil down to either <strong>performing in bars for criminally low pay for the rest of your life</strong>, or risking your entire career, reputation, mental health, and life by throwing your towel into the ring of <strong>exploitative reality television</strong>.</p>
<p>I want to show that queer artists, especially drag queens, can not only make their own music, but that they can do it without using the established pathways.</p>
<p>As a drag queen, I created the show //sub.rosa with the desire to inspire other drag artists like myself to start their own shows, shows that matter to them, instead of waiting around to be included into the shows that already existed at the time. I really do believe that //sub.rosa played a part in the ""drag boom"" we are experiencing in Austin now, and I know that this project has that <i>same</i> potential to shake things up.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Obstacles</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, I think the major risk to this EP is the negative opinion toward drag queens making music. Let's be honest, a lot of the music drag queens have given us in the past few years hasn't been especially thoughtful. My project is going to be immediately lumped into the category of ""drag queen music"" because of who I am, how I present myself, and what I do. And I want that to happen.</p>
<p>The major obstacle for me is going to be changing the collective conception of what it means to be a drag queen and a musician. I wrote these songs, I composed them, and I finished them with Joe Stacey's help as the lead producer. I can only hope others will see them as valid, which is why your support means so much to me.</p>

There are three demos to listen to above, but I'm also making the rest of them available to you as a perk!  Once the demos are complete, I'll begin the final recordings. These will hopefully be done by next summer, and then passed on to Colin for mixing and mastering. Physical merch pre-orders will go live through Bandcamp sometime next year, once the album is finished. If all goes according to plan, Defiance will be released before the end of 2020, and this awesome album art by Alex Eckman-Lawn will be forever immortalized in print. If you'd like to contribute, but also want physical merch when it launches next year, I'm happy to prorate purchase of physical merch by your digital pre-order amount. Just let me know!Please help me by sharing this campaign! The more people that my music reaches, the more merch I'll be able to create. Thanks so much in advance for your support!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This crowdfunding campaign is an appeal to collaborate, financially, with Very Good for the release of their newest album, Adulthood. The album will be released on vinyl record as well as CD and digital formats.</p>
<p>We are a theatrical chamber-rock band based out of New York City. The person writing is Sean Cronin, and he is/I am the main reason all of this insanity happens. We've been working hard on this record for a long time, and we're very excited to share it with the world. I believe it to be quite different, quite unique to this particular group of people at this particular moment of time.</p>
<p>Basically, we're trying to cover both the cost the actual product (vinyl/CD/digital), and the cost of proper publicity for the album release.</p>
<p>The cost of pressing vinyl is quite high, but I realized that if I don't start trying to make albums that sound as amazing as possible now, it may not happen. And vinyl is what that sounds like. I suppose I may have entered my ""uncompromising artist"" phase.</p>
<p>As far as publicity costs go, many artists like myself have often felt great about the music we have recorded, only to have the boxes full of this beautiful art sit in our apartments, gathering dust (and taking up valuable NYC real-estate!). With this album, I have resolved to give it the push that I know the music deserves, which requires that I work with people who are MUCH better at public relations (PR) than I am. </p>
<p>Are you picking up on the ""Adulthood"" theme, here? This is the real grown-up stuff.</p>
<p>At certain stages it can be a challenge to make the art AND generate the finance necessary to make the art. IF we can reach these goals, simply put it means that we can release this record in a way that will perpetuate the cycle of creation, and we can keep making more albums and concentrating on the work we do, instead of how to pay off our credit cards, etc...</p>
<p>I want this album to be something that generates new pathways of possibility for myself and the other amazing artists involved to share what we have to offer, and to do so unimpeded by the limitations of our finance. Separate from this project, that's what I want to see happening with people's creations.</p>
<p>If you share this belief, and happen to be interested in what we're doing as a group, please consider helping us reach our goal!</p>

<p>Anyway, thank you from the bottom of my little weirdo heart for even taking a moment to consider donating to this campaign. I know that not everyone can show their support in the form of energy known as money and if you want to do so in any other way, it's also appreciated (such as: sharing on social media, hugging in real life, buying the album after it comes out, coming out to our shows, hugs, just being really truly authentically yourself and doing your best work, and hugging me or other people). I know it's difficult to wade through all the information and ""advertising"" in this virtual realm, so even the fact that you're checking this out, and aware of what I'm doing and interested in is BEAUTIFUL and I'm very grateful for this.</p>
<p>I hope your journeys lead you to illumination and expansion and that you allow yourself to be the beautiful weirdo you are, if only in certain circumstances. Like starting a band. Or making an album.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>UPDATE! Keep it coming!... note: a number of people have found it easier to donate via my fiscal sponsor link and a couple gave cash.  Right now, therefore, the actual donated amount is about $1150!... If you are here, use this page!... Thanks!! Happy to exceed goal overall... set it a little low anyways!...</p>
<p>My name is Christopher Kaufman.  I have dedicated my life to the creation and presentation of new music and art.  For this purpose I founded CHIRON Performing Arts in 1991, and have enjoyed years of working with wonderful artists of all disciplines and presenting their work and my own.</p>
<p>The event for which I request your support is a landmark event for CHIRON - The New York Premiere of Eugene O’Brien’s ‘Algebra of Night’ - for Voice, Piano Quartet and the words of New York Poets. This music is a masterpiece from an important American composer.  Eugene O’Brien has influenced the lives and work of a generation of composers, through his music and his work as a teacher.</p>
<p>He was, in fact, my teacher in my formative years just after high school when I attended the Cleveland Institute of Music. His approach was to guide me on my path as an artist with gentleness and powerful support, which serves me to this day.  We will also present two world premieres of my own music and a newly furbished version of my environmental work, Hudson Valley Music.</p>
<p>We are featuring a collection of highly respected world-class musicians with international reputations. Your support helps us pay them!... as well as hall rental costs and the like.</p>
<p>They are:<br/>Clara Osowski - mezzo soprano, Gregory Fulkerson - violin, Taka Kigawa - piano, Robert Dick - flute(s), Daniel Rieppel - piano, Monica Bauchwitz - violin and members of the String Orchestra of New York City.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need help paying for our artists, hall rental costs, marketing and travel. Clara Osowski and co-director Daniel Rieppel are traveling here from Minnesota to join us here.</p>
<p>Each musician has an independent contract for participation, some use agents, others are regular CHIRON artists. Needless to say the total far exceeds the amount we are going for in this campaign. We received an independent donation which helps, but there is a ways to go.</p>
<p>Your contribution - at any level - will help immensely!  I did an indiegogo campaign a few years back for equipment to perform my environmental works far and wide... I use them often!</p>
<p>There is no way overstate both the importance of this event to our work and community and our appreciation for your support.</p>
<p>We have perks!... you’ll see them on our page.</p>
<p>OUR PERKS: Christopher Kaufman will prepare an album of the concert and deliver it to you via ‘we transfer’. Tickets are offered. Kaufman’s highly original album of his environmental works where he creates piece with natural sounds mixed with live performance. One such will be on the concert - Hudson Valley Music - but there many more. All such albums delivered on line.</p>
<p>If we do not reach the stated goal... the funds are still used for the project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Mission of CHIRON Performing Arts is to present the evolutionary visions of artists via powerful and exciting performances by world-class musicians. It has also been to bring the arts from the Ivory Tower to the Community. We’ve been doing that for quite a while now, since 1991.</p>
<p>I am proud to say that via CHIRON, I have presented the work of hundreds of Artists of all disciplines. We have held chamber concerts all over New York, including radio shows and collaborations with symphony orchestras.</p>
<p>For two years, recently,  I put my two concert series types, CHIRON and The Phantastic Theater (my concert series presenting new music and art to family-based audiences), into one, titled The CHIRON Festival for the Arts and Environment. For this I had guests such as Arunima Roy - a member of Jane Goodall’s National Youth Council. I featured environmental pieces on these events. There is a great deal of information about these events on our website, including videos, press and music players. We have a long track record to investigate if you wish!</p>
<p>It is our belief that the arts should demonstrate the complete human intelligence and thus participate in the evolution of humankind. We attempt to participate in this process in a natural way, by focusing on our love of music and engaging imagination as much as we can.</p>
<p>Please join us... offer support through this campaign... come to the concert... join email list so we can keep you abreast of our activities and future events!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Putting together an innovative, enthralling and meaningful program comes naturally to us. The artists involved are extremely talented and ready to go.  The only limiting factor to our work for is financial. This is why we reach out to you for support.</p>
<p>Our qualifications and experience is quite profound. I achieved my doctorate in music composition in 1991, and studied with a number of world-class composers... including Gene O’Brien.  You can find out much more about me at my home site - <a href=""http://www.soundartus.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.soundartus.com</a>. Co-Director Daniel Rieppel has been a champion of New Music for many years. He is a beloved teacher in his own right and conducts the SWMinnesota Orchestra. </p>
<p>Our featured guest Artist, Eugene O'Brien - composer, has a list of accomplishments and awards which would take the rest of these pages to list.  Many can be seen on our promotional video! Suffice it to say, he is an important American Composer, Artist and Teacher and it is our greatest honor to present his music.  Especially the New York Premiere of this piece which features the words of New York Poets.  It is an historic occasion.</p>
<p>Our Musicians are out of this world. Gregory Fulkerson toured world-wide with the revival of Glass’s ‘Einstein on the Beach’, and performs Don Erb’s Violin Sonata on a regular basis. Robert Dick is perhaps the premiere new music flutist and composer on planet Earth. Taka Kigawa is internationally known for his super dynamic performances of the most difficult works as well as his sensitive performances of familiar ones.  Monica Bauchwitz is well-known as a leading violinist and concert producer in NYC and, last but not least, Clara Osowski is a premiere singer of the finest stripe hailing from the artistic heartland of our country, Minneapolis. Minnesota.</p>
<p>Come hear them perform! Please help us pay them!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>These campaigns have positive effects beyond financial assistance. They force one to reach out and communicate dreams and plans, to put everything into words... to push one's work out into the universe... often with unforeseen rewards.  We look forward to these!</p>
<p>Please, at the least, come to the event and see/hear it for yourself. We will accept support at that time as well :)... in order to help create next year’s events. Help put the word out. Invite friends, share links and facebook posts when you see them.  Use indiegogo SHARE TOOLS!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>At the age of nineteen, I packed my bags and left the peaceful countryside of Co. Wexford for the hustle and bustle of Dublin. I began busking on the street corners of Temple Bar. It was there that I developed my love for performing, and began to properly develop my voice and style. After a year, I left Ireland to see where the music would take me. Since then, I've been lucky enough to busk my way across more than ten countries, and played many beautiful gigs along the way.</p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2><u>Street Songs</u></h2>
<p>Busking has been an amazing way to see the world. I've observed countless smiling and crying faces, embraces and breakups, love and grief. I've played for travellers, business people, the homeless and a thousand other people along the way. I've had heartfelt conversations with strangers, that would have never happened had I not been playing. It's incredibly humbling every time someone approaches me to thank me for my music, and I don't take it lightly. All these experiences make their way into a notebook eventually, and with a bit of luck they grow into songs. I've sold my songs on homemade CDs for years, but the more I thought about the people who found some kind of solace in my music, the more I wanted to create something worthy of them. At the end of 2019, I decided it was time to book a studio, and record my first full length album.</p>

<p>Hello lovely people,  </p>
<p>I am finally making my first solo record! While this is both a very exciting and extremely nerve-wracking announcement to make, it unfortunately must be made via a crowdfunding platform. I only use the word ""unfortunately"" because these are hard times for all, or most of us, and also because asking for money makes me truly uncomfortable. However, what makes me feel a bit better is the fact that the majority of the money I raise here will be going directly toward paying other creative people for helping me make this album happen, and happen how I've really wanted it to happen for years now, in a professional studio, hiring talented friends to join me, and hopefully having a little left over to get it out to all of you and wherever else I can get it in the universe once it is completed. </p>
<p>I'm sure most of you have heard every version of a musician explaining how expensive it is to make an album and make it right, so I'll spare you another one and instead just say that between my own personal savings and the generosity of very close friends, I already have just barely enough raised to afford the actual In studio time, so genuinely the reason I am doing this campaign is to afford to pay the artists who will be playing on the record with me, helping me produce it, and as I said hopefully paying someone to help get it on all the proper streaming platforms and into the ether etc... </p>
<p>I am really excited to share these songs with you all and to make sure everyone who helps me make them is shown the love they deserve. </p>
<p>Again these times are tough and wild but us artists gotta keep at it anyways.</p>
<p>Much love and thanks!</p>

<h3><i>Summary</i></h3>
<p>Many of you have known me from the time when I was a guitarist/ singer songwriter. What you may not know is that those days ended long ago while I was living in New Orleans and Focal Dystonia affected my left hand leaving me unable to play guitar.</p>
<p>To combat the frustration and ward off depression I began exploring composing. Eventually composing became my passion and I started on a long road of self study and private lessons which eventually bore fruit with an award winning orchestral work and performances of my music in the U.S, Mexico, Cuba and throughout Central America.</p>
<p>When 2020 began I was looking forward to a promising year ahead with various performances of my music in Latin America, the U.S. and Europe. Needless to say all of these performances were canceled and this year looks to be similar. That is why I have decided to record a favorite work of mine and what has brought me here to ask for your help.</p>
<p>A composer’s life is rather isolated if the composer is unable to perform on her or his instrument. There is no inspirational interplay with other musicians, no jam sessions, no rehearsals and no concerts or gigs. There is just the solitude of sitting in a room with your keyboard trying to give birth to new music that people will hopefully not only enjoy, but also will be moved by. However if that music is never performed then those creations are stillborn laying lifeless on sheets of paper.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><i>The objective of this recording is 3 fold:</i></h3>
<p>1. A composer needs exposure without that he /she has no  career. This recording will allow me to present my music to radio stations throughout North America and Europe. Airplay on these stations will give me the exposure I desperately need right now.</p>
<p>2. It will allow me to present a quality live recording of my work to professional musicians when talking about future projects or commissions.</p>
<p>3. It will be the first of a series of compositions for Clarinet, Cello, Piano trio that take their influence from both the jazz and classical world.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Passaggio Oper is an emerging opera company dedicated to bridging the gap and breaking the distance between the audience and the performers by making opera relatable, current, and real. Our artists consist of extremely talented emerging young professionals who are on the pathway or passageway to a professional career and who have come together with the shared love for beautiful music in order to bring that music to life on stage to modern and diverse audiences. Our idea was forged in Schöneberg, Berlin at the start of 2016, with the goal of combining quality, passion, and sincerity to create an authentic opera experience while making opera accessible to everyone. </p>
<p>Because of your support, we were able to put on six full operas with orchestra: Mozart's Le Nozze di Figaro, at the ehemaliges stummfilmkino Delphi Theater Berlin in May 2016, Puccini's La Boheme, at the Brotfabrik Berlin in October 2016, R. Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos at the Pfefferberg Theater Berlin in April 2017, Mozart's Don Giovanni at the Pfefferberg Theater Berlin in October 2017, Offenbach's Les Contes d'Hoffmann at the Pfefferberg Theater in June 2018, and then Puccini's La Boheme revival at the Pfefferberg Theater in November 2018.  Because of the success of our previous six operas which were only made possible because of YOU, we are now working on our SEVENTH opera, and FIRST virtual opera, Gianni Schicchi by Giacomo Puccini. </p>
<p>Puccini's Gianni Schicchi is a hilarious story of greed and selfishness, ending with a satisfying deception that has you rooting for the ""villain"".  When a family zoom call starts with a sudden on-screen death, things quickly escalate to chaos as the family tries to change the will of the deceased in order to best serve themselves.  They have no idea what hits them when Gianni Schicchi joins the call, and things go from bad to worse in this quirky, slightly dark comedy. </p>
<p>There are so many different types of conflicts in the news today. From cancelled culture, to Q-anon believers, to a battle between the left and the right wings, it’s hard for all these different sides to see eye-to-eye. It’s even more difficult when it’s your own relatives that you don’t agree with. The internet is abuzz with stories of family zoom calls going south very quickly in situations just like this. Our aim when presenting “Gianni Schicchi” is to showcase that no one side or belief is above another. If we don’t work together to find a solution, we can’t achieve anything. Or in the case of the Donati family in Gianni Schicchi, if they don’t work together, they are left wide open and unsuspecting when a deceptive con-man comes along…Join Passaggio Oper's unique zoom call via youtube, coming to you in May 2021!  We are so excited to put on this hilarious and beautiful ""zoom"" opera, and now more than ever we need YOUR help once again! </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is where we need your help.  To put on Gianni Schicchi, we will need to raise about $4,000.  In previous operas, there were so many costs involved including the venue, pianist, orchestra, rehearsal spaces, costumes, marketing material, and the set.  Because of this pandemic however, the costs we need to cover are a bit different.  Although we still need to raise money for the costumes, props, marketing, and conductor, for all of us performers it feels like Corona has taken away our careers, our livelihood and even our passion.  Therefore, the majority of your donations will go straight to the artists who have been struggling because of this pandemic and cancelled culture.  Your generous donations will help sustain our performers through this pandemic.  Together we will keep the arts alive and will not let a pandemic take away what we all love the most!  </p>
<p>Here is an exact breakdown of what we are trying to raise for Gianni Schicchi:</p>
<p>Costumes and Props: $250</p>
<p>Pianist/conductor fee : $300</p>
<p>Posters and marketing materials: $150</p>
<p>Artist fee: $300 per performer (11 performers x $300 = $3,300)</p>
<p>Total Cost: $4,000</p>
<p>Every donation you give gets you a special perk-from a personal mention on our social media sites, a digital audio CD of Gianni Schicchi, to a digital video of the opera and a ticket for our online performance!  Plus, anyone who donates will get their name printed on our website and digital program. The perk you get depends on the amount you donate.  You can see which donation gets you which perk on the right side of this page! </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our mission is to create performance opportunities for ourselves and fellow singers in a setting we can be proud of and our audiences can be moved by, while upholding the quality and integrity of this beautiful art form.</p>
<p>By donating, you will help us keep the arts alive, because for so many of us it feels as if the pandemic has taken that away.  With your help, we will bring motivation, passion, and opera back to this pandemic-ridden world. Together, art will not be silenced!  </p>

<h2>Zuby's NEW ALBUM is here</h2>
<p>Over the last several months, I've written and recorded a powerful, inspirational, and provocative new album called <strong>WORD OF ZUBY</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614066883/lhdlisuafctpk5swa59j.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>WORD OF ZUBY</strong> is my sixth album and my first music project in over two years. It's also my most important album to date.</p>
<p>Since releasing 'Perseverance' at the beginning of 2019, I've gained hundreds of thousands of new followers, appeared on some of the biggest podcasts in the world (including 'The Joe Rogan Experience'), and exposed millions of new people to my message through social media, interviews, and TV appearances.</p>
<p>Now, it's time to bring it back to the MUSIC.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/SAZCFG4ZXd4?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>I am a <strong>100% INDEPENDENT </strong>artist.</p>
<p>I've never signed to a record label, nor even had a manager. That means I can do what I want, artistically and business-wise, without having to answer to 'the music industry'. But it also means I don't have access to label funding, record advances, nor many mainstream promotional outlets.</p>
<p>It's you, my fans and supporters, that make everything possible.</p>
<p><strong>By backing this project, you are directly helping me to fund the independent release and promotion of WORD OF ZUBY. With your contribution, we can reach more people and help shift the culture in a positive direction.</strong></p>
<p><br/>On this album, I've collaborated with amazingly talented artists and producers from the UK, USA, Canada, and Europe. I'm proud of every single song.</p>
<p><strong>Tracklist:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Real</li>
<li>Devil May Cry</li>
<li>Moments (feat. YONAS) </li>
<li>OK Dude</li>

<li>Underrated (feat. Mac Lethal &amp; Shao Dow)</li>

Now, it's time to bring it back to the MUSIC.

 
I am a 100% INDEPENDENT artist.
I've never signed to a record label, nor even had a manager. That means I can do what I want, artistically and business-wise, without having to answer to 'the music industry'. But it also means I don't have access to label funding, record advances, nor many mainstream promotional outlets.
It's you, my fans and supporters, that make everything possible.
By backing this project, you are directly helping me to fund the independent release and promotion of WORD OF ZUBY. With your contribution, we can reach more people and help shift the culture in a positive direction.
On this album, I've collaborated with amazingly talented artists and producers from the UK, USA, Canada, and Europe. I'm proud of every single song.
Tracklist:

Real
Devil May Cry
Moments (feat. YONAS) 
OK Dude
Legacy (feat. Stephen Smitley & Eric July)
Underrated (feat. Mac Lethal & Shao Dow)
Hallelujah (feat. Bryson Gray)

</p><p><b>OVERVIEW:</b></p>
<p>Now through the end of June, Dark Water Rising is teaming up with IndieGogo to try to raise $20,000 towards our new album.  The band's sophomore release (<i>Grace &amp; Grit: Chapter I</i>) helped capture the 2014 Native American Music Award for ""Best Inspirational Recording"" and capped off another era of music for DWR. The upcoming record will encompass two years of new material with an edgier, more rockin' sound than before. We are calling the album ""Walnut Branch"" in honor of our band house in Chapel Hill - a secluded haven of late night practices, rigorous recording sessions, and beautiful mornings writing songs on the back porch. For two years we have heard people ask ""When is the new album coming out?"" Well, the time has finally come, but we need your help to make it happen!</p><p><br/></p>

<div><br/></div>
<div>My name is Larry Ewings, aka Jupiter 7.  I am an Emcee, Producer, and youth worker from the Bay Area.  I've been an independent hip-hop artist since 2003.  My rap career started back in 95' while I was in high school in Salinas, CA.  What started off as a dream and something I did for fun, became a reality in 2004 when I released my first professional EP.  At that time, I was living in East Oakland, just graduated from college, and was working as a youth director.  I was broke, living in a dorm room, doing shows for free, and trying to play a positive role in my community.  Since these humble beginnings,  I have independently released over six full length albums and have performed with some of the best local and national artists.  I am excited to introduce my newest project and hope you can help me with this campaign.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>My new album RETROSPECT is the second full length project with Belarus producer Mistapool.  The theme behind the project is to use past life moments, snapshots of time, that could be used for material to fuel each song.  Retrospect is the most developed project that I've ever worked on in which each track has been carefully crafted to convey a type of feeling or message.  It's been four years since I released any music due to the birth of my son Lyric (who's 2 years old now), the passing of my father (March 2015), and my current job working with at-risk youth (Since 2011). My goal as an artist has always been to reach people on a personal level and to create music that universally everyone can listen to.  As an independent artist, it's extremely difficult to get the push and coverage (money and promotion) that signed artists receive without being part of a major record label.  The benefit of being an indie artist is there is no label controlling what the music sounds like, content to engage the listener with, and what image is portrayed.  In essence, you are more likely to get the real and unfiltered creativity of the artist... not what the record label sells you.  With that said, I can't do this on my own.  You are the lifeline to what I do and where the music goes.  My goal at the end of the day is to create music that will positively effect you as a person, us as a community, and hip-hop as a culture.   </div>

...record, produce, and release our debut album that will bring to life Nathan Kolosko’s Hungarian
Trio, Klaus Hinrich Stahmer’s Debussyana, Dusan Bogdanovic's Over the Edge, and entirely new works by Garrett Shatzer, Durwynne Hsieh, and David Smith - all three commissioned by Black Cedar. None of these works have been commercially recorded, and your donation will give them the audience they deserve.

Roughly 250 hours...
...can go into composing a new work of chamber music, says Garrett Shatzer: 


And, when composers write music, they relinquish a part of
themselves not only to the musicians who interpret their creation but 
also to the
audience that receives the finished product. Durwynne Hsieh often finds 
himself telling a story through his music, even if he is not sure where 
that story will lead:




Music comes to life when the triangle is complete......through the mind that imagines it, the performers who bring it to life, and
the humans who hear and experience it:
If music is not heard, it does not exist. Help us deliver these fine works of art to the audience they so richly deserve.

You can help us with...


THE $3,000 TOTAL COMMISSIONING FEES FOR OUR COMPOSERS.
 After 250 hours of composition time, a $1,000 commission to a composer means an hourly rate of only $4. Mama, don't let your babies grow up to be composers.


THE $5,000 ESTIMATED COST TO PRODUCE THIS ALBUM WITH VGO RECORDINGS.
Vince Go is an amazing recording engineer who is generously offering us a very low fee for our first album. There are multiple steps involved with creating the final product:

Recording the music
Editing and Mixing the sounds
Mastering the final selections
Creating the album art work and the graphic design
Replicating and duplicating all of those compact discs

Once the product is ready to go, Black Cedar will cover the costs of marketing, promotion, and advertising with our own ticket sales and concert proceeds.

Or simply help us spread the word...

<p>Friends, Family, Supporters!</p>
<p>As many of you know, I’ve been working on my second CD project, Strange Place, for years now. In that time, I’ve been singing all over NYC and NJ as a solo artist and as part of groups.  I released my first CD, a live recording entitled “The Song Is Mine” back in 2002 (check it out on Amazon.com) and since then, have wanted to do a studio project where I could express through music, some of what it was like to live and work in New York City.  I know a million people have tackled that same theme, but  the combination of music and lyrics on Strange Place (some of my original work as well as carefully chosen covers), will allow you to share my particular take on the experience. </p>
<p>I’ve been fortunate to work with so many talented people on this: Musicians from NYC and New Jersey, my co-producer Kevin Jasper, music director James Followell  with whom I co-wrote two of the songs; Videographer Reid Carrescia,  Asbury Park artist Larry Porter..the list goes on.  The project has been started and stopped and started again many times, but this time it's really happening!  </p>
<p>I’ve spent a lot of hours back in the studio, re-recording and re-working the tracks. It’s all sounding  and feeling wonderful.  But I need your help to bring this thing home.  Please take a look at the two videos on this site. In one, I'm making my plea for your dollars, and the other is a video of the first track on Strange Place; an excerpt from Elton John's ""Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters"".  It's short, but it gives you an idea of the overall musical palette of this CD.</p>
<p>Here’s the nitty gritty:  I’ve already invested just under $15,000 and I know I can finish this with $8,000 more. There are 13 tracks on the CD and I’ve got 8 that are 90% finished. The other 4 need to be recorded and I’ve got all of that lined up.  That $8,000 will go toward the recording,  mixing and mastering of those 4 tracks as well as the production of the actual CD, including the packaging and a couple of shows to release it. I'll be all over Facebook as well with updates and more 30 second sound clips from the tracks.  If you can’t donate any money, then please pass the campaign link to whoever you think might be able to help out.</p>
<p>I know this is an ambitious goal. But I’m dreaming big here. You have to ask for what you need, right?  $8,000 is 300 people donating $25.00 each. That doesn’t seem impossible to me. And if you donate $25.00, you'll be getting a CD when it comes out!  So many people have invested their time and talent on this. I want to honor that by finishing it and getting it out there into the world.  I want it to be heard.  This year! I know that I can get this done with $8,000. Please check it out and if you like what you see and hear, make a contribution. We've got 60 days to make this happen.   Help me finish this. I truly believe you’ll enjoy it. </p>

<h3>The Pop Record</h3>
<p>In February of 2014, Justin and Harry set out to make their craziest record yet. Most of their work up until that point had been experimental in nature, but they decided it was time to create the pop record they had always talked about. And to up the ante, they decided to write AND record the album in just 28 days as a response to the Recording Project Month (RPM) Challenge. Miraculously, through sleepless nights, occasionally unproductive sessions, hangry disagreements, and the near destruction of their friendship, they emerged with an oddly compelling, highly eclectic selection of pop tunes that they now consider some of their finest work. </p>
<p>Despite the overall success of the project, the short time frame of the sessions meant there were a few flaws on the record. The first step will be to correct those problems, and to then remix the album in a professional studio before having it sent out to be mastered for vinyl. </p>
<p>The original version of the Pop Record can be heard here: <a href=""https://paintedrecords.bandcamp.com/album/hartley-the-jubb-present-a-pop-record"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://paintedrecords.bandcamp.com/album/hartley-the-jubb-present-a-pop-record</a></p>
<h3>The complete box set</h3>
<p>Additionally, they have been digging in the vaults to find all of the previously unheard recordings they have made over the last ten years of working together. These will all be assembled on to a hand painted USB drive, the perfect compliment to the official Painted Records catalogue USB drive. </p>
