International University Preparatory (AIUP) advances the education of
Indigenous youth in the urban innner city that is home to the largest
concentration of Native Peoples outside of Mexico City through a harmonious
regeneration of community, culture and consciousness as Indigenous Peoples. Our
school emerged from the hearts of mothers, fathers, and teachers who took that
first step thirteen years ago who organized a resistance to English-only laws
in the State of California in effect to this day that prohibit maternal
language education. Anahuacalmecac was born in forgotten barrios, in abandoned
buildings, in neglected city parks, in dumpsters made libraries, in overcrowded
schools, beneath compassionate trees, below ancient hills, blanketed by the
thunder and rains of a southern California sky.  Vision, passion and
commitment are requirements of the resilience and relentlessness cultivated in
our students. The honor of being a xinaxtli or a 'seed of the people"" in
Anahuacalmecac require dedication and dreaming. </p>

These groups are expected to benefit from ‘Dream&amp;Child’ project. The problem or critical issue which the proposal seeks to resolve is the poverty of most families, The Nepal Earthquake (on 25th of April 2014) and corrupted political society and economical instability has stolen children’'s lives and hopes. For example, domestic labour, street children, children in armed conflict and sex workers who are exposed to the risk of HIV/AIDS. Other facts to be noted: o	Child marriage (%) 2002-2012 married by 15-18, 50.8%** o	Attendance in early childhood education 2005-2012, 30.1%** Basic health care (physical and mental illness), education and provision of shelter needs urgent help. <br/><br/>There is a serious need for awareness creation and disciplinary action in an innovative, proactive and structured manner, which is what this project is all about. <br/><br/>This proposal relates to the national strategies and policies of children rights. ‘Since the early 1990s the issue of child rights and child labor has received greater attention which is being reflected in national policies and programs. Because of the social and economic circumstances of the country, child labor issue in Nepal are rather difficult and complex.

<p>Founded in 2014 by 16 year old Emir Özsüer, Project Lift is a non-profit organization consisting of trained mental health professionals and a dedicated organizational team. We help children who have experienced traumatic life events through art workshops and creative expression while offering them a safe and therapeutic environment. We offer five day workshops to a maximum of sixty children at one time to ensure the quality of our services and individual attention for each child. We create opportunities for these children to express themselves in hopes that they will begin to heal and cope with their burdens, and work towards a brighter future. </p>

<p>Playing to Live! is an
organization that brings art, play and yoga therapy to children affected by
trauma. Evidence-based research shows that child-centered, creative art therapy techniques greatly improve a child's ability to express and understand
complex emotions resulting from trauma. Children can lack the words to
communicate their feelings and Playing To Live! gives them a voice. We empower
local community members by collaborating with them to create culturally relevant
therapy techniques and trainings.  We also partner with <a href=""http://www.playingtolive.org/partnerships.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">numerous local NGOs</a> to ensure sustainability of our programming. While we work towards
becoming our own non-profit, we are accepting charitable donations
through our fiscal
sponsor, the 501c3 <a href=""http://africanelephants.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ahali Elephants</a>. Playing to Live! is in its first year
of existence and has already experienced incredible growth and
recognition in Liberia, where the program was born. Our vision is to continue
to expand and bring the healing arts to more children worldwide. </p>
<p></p>When PTL! began in Liberia, we responded to a crisis situation. Alexis Decosimo, our Founder and Executive Director, asked Jessi Hanson, our Co-Founder and Director of our Liberian program, to fly to Liberia during the height of Ebola to help build an essential program to identify the mental health needs of children experiencing the trauma of Ebola. The Playing to Live! clinical team was created and built our program quickly in order to respond to the urgent need of the children in Liberia. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">We partnered with the non-profit </span><a href=""http://africanelephants.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"">Ahali Elephants</a><span style=""background-color: initial;""> in order to accept charitable donations, and we partnered with a Liberian NGO </span><a href=""http://www.reshliberia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"">Renewed Energy Serving Humanity </a><a href=""http://www.reshliberia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"">(RESH)</a><span style=""background-color: initial;""> to help us recruit and train local caregivers in art, play and yoga therapy techniques. </span><a href=""http://www.reshliberia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"">RESH</a><span style=""background-color: initial;""> is also responsible for on the ground oversight of the caregivers and the Playing To Live! programming.  These techniques were then brought to the children living in isolation centers after experiencing the loss of their family members to Ebola. </span>

Playing to Live! is an
organization that brings art, play and yoga therapy to children affected by
trauma. Evidence-based research shows that child-centered, creative art therapy techniques greatly improve a child's ability to express and understand
complex emotions resulting from trauma. Children can lack the words to
communicate their feelings and Playing To Live! gives them a voice. We empower
local community members by collaborating with them to create culturally relevant
therapy techniques and trainings.  We also partner with numerous local NGOs to ensure sustainability of our programming. While we work towards
becoming our own non-profit, we are accepting charitable donations
through our fiscal
sponsor, the 501c3 Ahali Elephants. Playing to Live! is in its first year
of existence and has already experienced incredible growth and
recognition in Liberia, where the program was born. Our vision is to continue
to expand and bring the healing arts to more children worldwide. 
When PTL! began in Liberia, we responded to a crisis situation. Alexis Decosimo, our Founder and Executive Director, asked Jessi Hanson, our Co-Founder and Director of our Liberian program, to fly to Liberia during the height of Ebola to help build an essential program to identify the mental health needs of children experiencing the trauma of Ebola. The Playing to Live! clinical team was created and built our program quickly in order to respond to the urgent need of the children in Liberia. We partnered with the non-profit Ahali Elephants in order to accept charitable donations, and we partnered with a Liberian NGO Renewed Energy Serving Humanity (RESH) to help us recruit and train local caregivers in art, play and yoga therapy techniques. RESH is also responsible for on the ground oversight of the caregivers and the Playing To Live! programming.  These techniques were then brought to the children living in isolation centers after experiencing the loss of their family members to Ebola. 
We have had incredible success in Liberia, and we will be growing thanks to a generous grant from UNICEF through our Liberian partner Renewed Energy Serving Humanity (RESH). In the next 6 months, we will be be training 40 female Ebola survivors to implement our program, 40 Liberian social workers to support the program, and access 800 children who are identified for being the most highly affected from the trauma of Ebola. 
Our program has thrived in Liberia and we would like to bring this same program to the homeless children of South Africa! The Playing to Live! Liberia program was only possible because of your generous support- we need your help to make this happen in South Africa! 



The success of our program has been featured in several publications:                                                                                    


Expanding Towards a Global Initiative
In less than a year we have grown from an idea to an organization serving hundreds of children and providing effective and lasting skills to local caregivers. As Playing to Live! matures we want to build a strong and
effective global response program. This requires intensive and diverse fieldwork and
evaluation. 

Meet Alexis! 
               

Since the beginning of Playing to Live!, Alexis has utilized her current doctoral work at ETSU in the field of public health to help build Playing to Live!'s capacity, evidence based protocol, and sustainability. Alexis is currently in South Africa for 10 weeks (June 1-August 13), where she is combining her required doctoral internship with the chance to expand PTL with a partnership with a local organization called Tshwane Leadership Foundation. The partnership between Tshwane Leadership Foundation (TLF) and Playing to Live! came together thanks to a connection through some members of OPSSA . During this 10 weeks Playing to Live! will provide programming and training  to TLF for support in a winter program for homeless youth as well as expansion to a year log program. 
Alexis's goals during this 10 weeks are: 

 · 
Train TLF staff in the PTL training
 · 
Build assessments for the training to evaluate
the trainee’s understanding
· 
Continue to build the training program based off
of the assessments 
· 
Support the trainees to implement our expressive
therapy program for 80  homeless youth in South Africa in TLF’s winter (July)
program 
· 
Build assessments to evaluate the children’s and
trainee’s response to the programming
· 
Hold focus groups to record feedback from the
implemented program from children, implementers, and community
· 
Build the evidence based practice by building
the connection to literature
· 
Write journals for publications based off of
evaluations and research
· 
Connect with local expressive therapists and
build connections for future work
· 
Advocate for expressive therapies in South
Africa and globally by reporting our results and progress through social media,
blogging, and publications
· 
Build a sustainable year long program for TLF

progress 
It will take about 10 weeks to piloting the program in South Africa and we can't do it without your help!  While our local South African partners will be supporting our efforts on the ground, we will need funding to cover our plane tickets, housing, transportation, food and other essential items for the duration of the project so that we can meet our goals. 
As in Liberia, we are not working alone. We have partnered with the following South African NGOs: Tshwane Leadership Foundation, Lerato House, and the Organization for Pediatric Support in South Africa (OPSSA). These partners will help us recruit caregivers for the trainings, provide space for the children to receive care and continue to oversee the program into the future.  

This program is immensely important to Playing To Live! because if we succeed organizations such as UNICEF will support the South Africa program just as they have done in Liberia. 

You hold the key to making this pilot program happen. We know we can do this, but we need your support!
Join those who are already supporting our work!

Your support will allow us to train 20 caregivers to provide creative art therapy techniques to 80 children, ranging in age from 6-18. Not only will your donation directly impact the children, but because we employ the caregivers once they complete the training your donation will also help support and build the local economy.      Risks & Challenges Like any new project, there are always obstacles to overcome. While we succeeded in Liberia, we understand that South Africa is a different country with its own challenges.  We will be working for the first time with many of our South African partners and we plan to carefully evaluate these partnership to ensure sustainability.   We have witnessed the essential role our Liberia partners played in helping us navigate the waters of starting our program and we are confident that our South African partnerships will be equally helpful.
Our South Africa partners will provide us with on the ground support, knowledge of how local systems work as well as the cultural norms, expectations and practices- making the program more likely to succeed. 
The US embassy in South Africa has also reached out to aid in our efforts and is an enthusiastic supporter of our organization's expansion into the region.    Other Ways You Can Help There are so many ways that you can help support Playing To Live! and we welcome all of them!

<h1> What we are about</h1>
<p><b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our names are David and Dani. David is a software engineer
and law student. Dani is an Innovation, Design &amp; Technology teacher at a local
Independent school. We own Techielab - a community based incubator that makes
cutting edge technology accessible, inspiring, positive and creative
for young people. We do this by offering after school and holiday camp
programmes that teach Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and
Mathematics. </p>
<p>We have a dream to make 3D printed prosthetics affordable
as well as a participative process for children and adults.</p>
<p>We have set out to develop, design and 3D
print affordable prosthetic hands. Lara and enablingthefuture.org have been inspirations and a starting point for us. Lara's E-nable hand as well as all the E-nable hands we have printed have been warmly donated to children.</p>
<p>Funds raised on this campaign will go towards finalising a new design already on the drawing board. A design that
mimics the functionality and dexterity of a human hand inspired by Biomimicry -
or imitating biology!  Our ThinkTank is led by adults and children. Our
next stage looks at bringing together ideas and designs in Biomedical and
Materials Engineering, introducing electronics to create a hand that also takes
human factors into account.</p>
<p>So here is the gist: We have examined many designs for 3D
printed hands, each with their contribution toward mimicking a real hand...
Yet, our team has developed a wish list of other functionalities and
innovations we would like to include. Our new design (still at its initial
stages) augments the current designs, looking not only at its mechanics but
also at its control. Now that we have printed quite a few purely mechanical
hands, we wish to add electronics, explore 3D printed conductive components and
develop new materials to interface between the skin and 3D printed parts.
Ultimately, we want to produce a hand controlled by thought alone, providing
the ability to control each finger and each angle of movement, allowing for
greater precision and dexterity- and one that does not involve surgical
intervention.</p>
<p>Your
contribution will help us print hands for those who need them. It will allow us
to try out our innovations in collaboration with the children that will be
using them and bring together groups of children and adults who want to be part
of researching and developing solutions. Be part of our journey! </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h1><b><h1> What
We Need &amp; What You Get</h1></b></h1>
<p></p>
<p>What do we need?  Well, firstly, we need to buy
different types of 3D printers. Ours seem to be working 24 hours
a day!  We want to determine the optimal balance between cost, speed,
functionality and material. We want to put together events for children in
schools and teach them about 3D printing as well as product development,
biomimicry and the mechanics of how our hands work! We need to consult
with specialists, try new materials, develop new concepts and implement new
technologies. In addition we intend to create and share lesson plans about what we are
learning and doing with many students and teachers. </p>
<p>What do you get, you ask? You get the opportunity to help
this amazing group of children and adults take existing technology up a notch!
You get to help a child do the tasks we take for granted. Oh yes... We
also have a whole range of perks for you as well! Just check them out. </p><p></p><h1>New Designs</h1><div>Our R&amp;D has just discovered even more ways to make the prosthetics mimic the human hand... using all printable components keeping the cost low. Our design is now being prototyped and will be printed within the next week. Keep an eye out here for updates. </div>
<h1> The Impact</h1>
<p>The impact of your contribution will be life changing!
Look at Lara and so many other children who have received a 3D printed hand?
Knowing you have given someone the ability to pick up an apple, brush their
hair, or use a knife and fork is priceless! Simple tasks we all take for
granted...</p>
<p>We are excited about the prospects of the many offshoots
that could come about from this project… not least a journey that allows for
children to have an ""Aha!"" moment in their lives. It is vital to do what we can to inspire
a generation of future inventors, scientists and engineers. </p><p>Read about our efforts in the media: <a href=""http://www.kentonline.co.uk/tonbridge/news/3d-hand-built-by-classmates-38932/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.kentonline.co.uk/tonbridge/news/3d-hand-built-by-classmates-38932/</a></p><p>And our mention on Channel 5 national news: </p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKjNStsRetI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKjNStsRetI</a> </p>

</div>","What we are about


Our names are David and Dani. David is a software engineer
and law student. Dani is an Innovation, Design & Technology teacher at a local
Independent school. We own Techielab - a community based incubator that makes
cutting edge technology accessible, inspiring, positive and creative
for young people. We do this by offering after school and holiday camp
programmes that teach Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and
Mathematics. 
We have a dream to make 3D printed prosthetics affordable
as well as a participative process for children and adults.
We have set out to develop, design and 3D
print affordable prosthetic hands. Lara and enablingthefuture.org have been inspirations and a starting point for us. Lara's E-nable hand as well as all the E-nable hands we have printed have been warmly donated to children.
Funds raised on this campaign will go towards finalising a new design already on the drawing board. A design that
mimics the functionality and dexterity of a human hand inspired by Biomimicry -
or imitating biology!  Our ThinkTank is led by adults and children. Our
next stage looks at bringing together ideas and designs in Biomedical and
Materials Engineering, introducing electronics to create a hand that also takes
human factors into account.
So here is the gist: We have examined many designs for 3D
printed hands, each with their contribution toward mimicking a real hand...
Yet, our team has developed a wish list of other functionalities and
innovations we would like to include. Our new design (still at its initial
stages) augments the current designs, looking not only at its mechanics but
also at its control. Now that we have printed quite a few purely mechanical
hands, we wish to add electronics, explore 3D printed conductive components and
develop new materials to interface between the skin and 3D printed parts.
Ultimately, we want to produce a hand controlled by thought alone, providing
the ability to control each finger and each angle of movement, allowing for
greater precision and dexterity- and one that does not involve surgical
intervention.
Your
contribution will help us print hands for those who need them. It will allow us
to try out our innovations in collaboration with the children that will be
using them and bring together groups of children and adults who want to be part
of researching and developing solutions. Be part of our journey! 

 What
We Need & What You Get

What do we need?  Well, firstly, we need to buy
different types of 3D printers. Ours seem to be working 24 hours
a day!  We want to determine the optimal balance between cost, speed,
functionality and material. We want to put together events for children in
schools and teach them about 3D printing as well as product development,
biomimicry and the mechanics of how our hands work! We need to consult
with specialists, try new materials, develop new concepts and implement new
technologies. In addition we intend to create and share lesson plans about what we are
learning and doing with many students and teachers. 
What do you get, you ask? You get the opportunity to help
this amazing group of children and adults take existing technology up a notch!
You get to help a child do the tasks we take for granted. Oh yes... We
also have a whole range of perks for you as well! Just check them out. New DesignsOur R&D has just discovered even more ways to make the prosthetics mimic the human hand... using all printable components keeping the cost low. Our design is now being prototyped and will be printed within the next week. Keep an eye out here for updates. 
 The Impact
The impact of your contribution will be life changing!
Look at Lara and so many other children who have received a 3D printed hand?
Knowing you have given someone the ability to pick up an apple, brush their
hair, or use a knife and fork is priceless! Simple tasks we all take for
granted...
We are excited about the prospects of the many offshoots
that could come about from this project… not least a journey that allows for
children to have an ""Aha!"" moment in their lives. It is vital to do what we can to inspire
a generation of future inventors, scientists and engineers. Read about our efforts in the media: http://www.kentonline.co.uk/tonbridge/news/3d-hand-built-by-classmates-38932/And our mention on Channel 5 national news: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKjNStsRetI

</p><p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>The vulnerable childhood and
youth in Colombia is in great need of opportunities for education in the arts
and the values that can foster and enhance a successful path towards peace, a
better economy, and a better quality of life. The Foundation <i>Constructores de Patria</i> has designed a comprehensive
program that aims to empower children and adolescents through education in
music, sports, plastic arts, languages and environmental issues combined with
coaching in the core principles and values of a healthy and peaceful
society—such as tolerance, solidarity and respect—. The pilot program of this
initiative was launched 10 months ago and it benefits a group of children and
adolescents from the public schools in the township of Rozo, in the region of
Valle del Cauca, Colombia. </p><p><br/></p>

<p> Joseph Lamin owns the Cockle Bay Guesthouse in Freetown, a compound of eight or so apartments that are rented out to guests traveling in Sierra Leone. He and his organization, Programme for Children, also partner with <a href=""http://schoolsforsalone.org/our-partners"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Schools for Salone</a>, overseeing construction and financing of each of the schools built by the organization. </p>
<p>He was born the youngest in  a large family in Sierra Leone. He says he learned very early to fend for himself or he wouldn’t get anything to eat. This taught him resilience and how to recognize good opportunities. </p>
<p>He got his start in business as a young man by purchasing a videotape cassette player and taking it around to different villages and screening tapes for a few leones. This money eventually allowed him to purchase a car. He then convinced one of his brothers to let him take his plastic barrels of palm oil to sell, using his car to get a better price for them than his brother could get in his home village. Joseph was very successful at this.</p>
<p>And so Joseph took the money from the palm oil and bought a second car, fixing it up and selling it for a profit. This led him to buy two more cars, and he sold those and bought four cars. This went on for some time, buying two cars for every one car he sold. Eventually, he bought some property in Freetown and went into business with a local real estate company, learning the way the market worked.</p>
<p>When war came in the 1990s he emigrated from the country with great reluctance and guilt. While living in England, he earned a masters degree in business. During his dissertation work, he read about American companies that invest part of their profits back into their communities, and when Joseph returned to Sierra Leone after the war ended, he did the same. </p>
<p>Though he has a wife and four children living still in England, Joseph chose to come back to Freetown to build live in one of the capitol's poorest areas, a shanty town neighborhood where there are no roads and where people live in rotting tin sheds with mud floors. When his guest house became profitable nearly 10 years ago, he took the proceeds and started a neighborhood charity, now called Programme for Children, which finances the school fees for local children and helps their parents out of destitution. </p>

It destroyed everything in its path. Nobody was killed, but now 80 children are destitute, surviving thanks to the generosity of a man named Joseph Lamin.  I am a friend of Joseph's, having stayed at his guest house in Cockle Bay in the summer of 2010 and 2011 while volunteering in the country. 
On his 53rd birthday five years ago, My friend Cherie and my daughter and I attended the party he threw for the children in his neighborhood. He said the greatest gift he could have is to see the children eat a huge meal, laugh and play for an afternoon.  Now he is feeding these children every day as their parents try to rebuild their homes.  They need basics such as toothbrushes and clothing and sandals. They need vitamins and food. They need uniforms so they can go back to school in the fall.  Will you help these children? They've lost everything.

What We Need & What You Get
  If we can raise $100 per child, it will go a long way towards helping them survive the next six months of the rainy season. 
Every cent raised will go to Joseph to feed and clothe these kids.    
The Impact Life in Cockle Bay was already unspeakably difficult. The homes are made of scraps of tin with no running water or electricity. Ebola devastated the city, sowing fear and disfunction for more than two years. Just as schools reopened for the children, this fire took everything.  These children have nobody else to turn to. The government is unable to help the families rebuild their homes. There is no daycare or safe place for the children to go. There are not even nearby parks or beaches for them to safely play.
$100 goes a long ways in Sierra Leone and will help stabilize life for these kids while the neighborhood is rebuilt.

Schools for Salone will wire all the funds from this campaign directly to Joseph Lamin. I served on the board of Schools for Salone from 2011-2014. 


This non-profit, non-denominational organization, created by Peace Corps Volunteers and based in Seattle, has successfully built 16 schools and two libraries in the country over 10 years.

Risks & Challenges 



There are no risks to donating to this cause. All of the money raised will be wired directly to Joseph for these children. He is one of the most honorable men I have ever known. 

If you wanted to help during the Ebola crisis but didn't know how, now is your chance. 
The challenge is great, but together we can demonstrate the goodness of humanity.

It showcases the responsible recycling of building materials. 
It celebrates the spirit of our neighbourhood.
It beautifies a corner that badly needs TLC (13th and Albert).  

It keeps alive our collective memory of a beloved neighbourhood friend of more than 100 years, Connaught School. 


 
  
Be a part of history!
The base project budget will be about $7,000 for design work, materials and machinery. We have some funds left over from Save Our Connaught's campaign to keep the school open, and support available from the Cathedral Area Community Association. An additional $1,500 will guarantee Ressambler gets completed in the best manner possible, becoming a durable, beautiful, lasting part of our neighbourhood.We have an experienced design team, a core of volunteer helpers (we could always use more!), support from the property owner at the location, and a generous neighbourhood that appreciates beauty and creativity.Your help will push this project over the top, so that by the end of summer we'll have a new neighbourhood entrance to be proud of. Let's make it  happen!

<p><b>ABOUT THE PROJECT  </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Musicaustral is a musical camp
designed for young musicians to develop and/or deepen their Latin-American musical

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In keeping with the legacy of the great
Chilean folk icon, Violeta Parra, Musicaustral promotes Latin-American roots music from an international perspective, and works to provide access to all
social classes and cultural backgrounds in order to promote
diversity and to create an open exchange. Combining elements of high education
with artistic and cultural activities, healthy life habits and recreation in
contact with the privileged local nature.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Seven recognized musicians and
teachers residing in Austria and Canada will be making their way to the south of Chile
to make this project a reality. Among those are the musicians of the Canadian
band Color Violeta, who have been promoting Latin American folkloric music
around the world for the past five years. </p>

<p>The camp will be held at the end of
January 2016 in Frutillar Bajo, Chile. A small village 1000 kilometers south
from the capital, Santiago, renowned for its classical music tradition.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This 1st edition is designed for 10
young musicians, aged 18 to 23, selected by their musical merit. An important
part of this project is to be able to grant students from low-income families a 100% scholarship. The accessible fee of $USD 250 covered

<a href=""http://www.colorvioleta.ca:"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.colorvioleta.ca</a></b></p><p>Musical inspirations for the academic structure of the Camp</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Color Violeta is a musical group
based on Daniel Emden's arrangements of the compositions of the great Chilean
folk musician Violeta Parra (1917-1967). Color Violeta reveal the essence of
Latin American traditional folk music, where rhythms such as the cueca,
festejo, candombe, huayno and chacarera are fused intelligently and subtly with
jazz.  In this way, the group succeeds in creating a musical offering that
is modern and original, yet respectful of its roots.</p>
<blockquote>“ I started the mission of internationally promoting
internationally South American folklore with my Canadian band, Color Violeta.
Together we have given master classes and workshops about Latin American
folklore music in the five countries we have toured, which has triggered the
idea of making a stronger cultural impact by bringing our understanding of
musical education outside of the stage. After years of professional music
experience and numerous encounters with talented young musicians in Canada, I
was amazed by the quality of their academic training and their experiences in
recognized musical camps and residences. So I decided to participate in
different camps with the firm idea of importing to Chile an alternative
educational system for young musicians where they can see the value and
richness of Latin American’s root music”.      Daniel Emden, Founder of Musicaustral </blockquote>

<p><b>A HEALTHY MUSICAL ENCOUNTER</b></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The practice of yoga will be part of our
daily activities. Through the systematic techniques of yoga including breathing
exercises, postures, concentration, healthy meals, and relaxation we aim to
provide tools to support
a healthy career at the emotional and physical level. </p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A professional musician is exposed to a
high degree of physical stress due to the demanding training, as well as mental
and emotional stress due to stage performance and self-confidence issues. Yoga can
help to reduce stress levels, as well as preventing injuries due to wrong
postures and repetitive movements during long periods of time. </p>

you doing this project?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Musicaustral team has a diverse
background, Austria, Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Canada and Venezuela. We have all

diversity found in Latin American roots music we want to empower young
musicians minds to help them find their own musical roots. To expand their
knowledge by its comprehensive rhythmic, and to dare to create intelligent
musical fusions with other styles, those of their interest. </p>
<p>2 - How much does it cost?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">An important part of the project is
to be able to grant students a 100% scholarship for those coming from a

<p><b>¿CUÁNDO, DÓNDE Y CÓMO?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">El campamento se llevará a cabo
del 22 al 31 de enero 2016 en Frutillar Bajo, Chile. Un pequeño pueblo a 1.000
kilómetros al sur de la capital, Santiago, reconocido por su tradición de
música clásica.</p>
<p>Esta primera edición está
diseñada para 10 músicos jóvenes, entre 18 y 23 años de edad, seleccionados en
base a su talento musical. Una parte muy importante de este proyecto es poder
otorgar becas que cubran la participación de jóvenes provenientes de
familias de bajo recursos. Con las matrículas de aquellos <span>participantes
que tengan la capacidad financiera para pagar el accesible monto de $ 250 USD,
se cubrirán las becas de los estudiantes que no cuenten con los recursos necesarios. El mensaje detrás de esta modalidad es crear un sentido de cooperación
entre las diferentes clases sociales.</span></p>
<p><b>PRESUPUESTO Y USO DEL DINERO</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Toda la contribución financiera
recaudada a través de esta campaña será destinada a lograr implementar exitosamente el Campamento. El 32% de los costos estan cubiertos gracias a

<p>Inspiraciones musicales y arreglos para la estructura
académica de Musicaustral</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Color Violeta es un grupo musical
basado en los arreglos de Daniel Emden a las composiciones del gran ícono de la
música popular chilena y Latinoamericana Violeta Parra (1917-1967). Color
Violeta revela la esencia de la música popular tradicional de América Latina,
donde los ritmos como la cueca, el festejo, el candombe, el huayno y la
chacarera se fusionan de forma inteligente y sutil con el jazz. De esta manera,
el grupo logra la creación de una propuesta musical moderna y original, a su
vez, respetuosa de sus raíces.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""Comencé la misión de
promover internacionalmente el folclore Sudamericano con mi banda Color
Violeta. Juntos hemos impartido clases magistrales y talleres sobre música
folklórica latinoamericana en los cinco países donde hemos estado de gira.  De allí ha nacido la idea de hacer un impacto
cultural más fuerte y llevar nuestra comprensión y educación de la música de
raíz fuera del escenario. Después de años de experiencia profesional en la
carrera de la música y numerosos encuentros con jóvenes músicos talentosos en
Canadá, me quedé sorprendido por la calidad de su formación académica y sus
experiencias en campamentos y residencias musicales. Entonces me decidí a
participar en diferentes campamentos reconocidos con el firme propósito de
importar a Chile (repercutiendo en Latinoamérica) un sistema educativo
alternativo para jóvenes músicos, en el que puedan ver el valor y la riqueza de
la música de raíz de América Latina"". <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Daniel Emden, Fundador de

<p><b>ESTRUCTURA ACADÉMICA</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">La principal característica de
nuestro sistema de aprendizaje es el acceso e intercambio constante con
profesores dedicados a orientar al estudiante a identificar su potencial y
fortaleza musical. Las principales actividades musicales incluirán:</p>
<p>• <b>Clases individuales,
uno-a-uno</b>, en los principales instrumentos: guitarra, quena, charango o sicus,
contrabajo, percusión y voz</p>
<p>• <b>Clases en grupo</b> (teoría
musical, ritmos latinoamericanos, improvisación, composición, práctica de
conjunto y sesiones pedagógicas)</p>
<p><b>• Practica personal y ensayos
en ensamble</b></p>
<p><b>• Clases magistrales </b>abiertas a la comunidad</p>
<p><b>• Conferencias </b>abiertas a la comunidad</p>
<p><b>• Concierto fina</b>l abierto a la
comunidad</p>
<p><b>UN ENCUENTRO MUSICAL SALUDABLE</b></p>
<p>La práctica del yoga será parte
de nuestras actividades diarias. A través de las técnicas sistemáticas de yoga,
incluyendo ejercicios de respiración, posturas, concentración, comidas
saludables, y la relajación, nuestro objetivo es ofrecer herramientas para
desarrollar una carrera saludable a nivel físico y emocional.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Un músico profesional se expone
a un alto grado de estrés físico debido a los exigentes entrenamientos diarios. Esto es equivalente al estrés de un deportista de alta competición, así como al estrés mental
y emocional en la práctica escénica. El yoga puede ayudar a reducir los niveles
de estrés, así como prevenir lesiones por posturas incorrectas y movimientos
repetitivos durante largos períodos de tiempo. De esta forma podemos preparar al músico para
que pueda disfrutar plena y conscientemente de su arte.</p>

<p><b>PREGUNTAS FRECUENTES</b></p>
<p>1- Por qué están realizando
este proyecto?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">El equipo de Musicaustral viene
de diversas culturas, Austria, Chile, Perú, Bolivia, Canadá y Venezuela.
Tenemos la experiencia e influencia de diferentes culturas, que  han asentado una comprensión clara sobre el
impacto de la unión en la diversidad. A través de esta rica diversidad que se
encuentra en la música de raíz latinoamericana queremos enriquecer a músicos
jóvenes para ayudarles a encontrar sus propias raíces musicales y que estos a
su vez impacten en el desarrollo artístico de su entorno. La música popular
latinoamericana es única e inmensamente rica en su rítmica, deseamos proveer el
conocimiento de ella para que músicos puedan crear fusiones inteligentes con
otros estilos de su interés, sea lo clásico, pop, rock, etc. Para esto la
porción académica de Musicaustral es principal e intensiva. </p>
<p>2- Cual es el costo del
campamento?</p>
<p>Una parte realmente importante
del proyecto es poder otorgar a los estudiantes la oportunidad de ser becados
en su totalidad, en el caso de venir de una familia de bajos ingresos (que se
evaluará a través de entrevistas y referencias). Los estudiantes/participantes
con capacidad económica de cubrir el costo, solo aportaran la módica suma de $
US 250, y con esto estarán ayudando a cubrir las becas completas de aquellos
talentos que no cuenten con el recurso monetario.</p>
<p>Nota: Musicaustral  recibe estudiantes de todo el mundo, aunque
no somos capaces de cubrir los gastos de transporte para las personas
provenientes del extranjero. </p>

<p><b>À PROPOS DU PROJET</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Le Camp Musicaustral est un
camp destiné aux jeunes musiciens désirant développer et approfondir leur identité
musicale latino-américaine durant une immersion de 10 jours se déroulant sur un
site extraordinaire à Frutillar, au sud du Chili. Nous avons comme mission
d’ouvrir l’esprit des jeunes en créant des rencontres musicales, éducatives et
originales avec des musiciens professionnels et reconnus. </p>
<p>Suivant les traces de
la grande folkloriste chilienne, Violeta Parra, Musicaustral promeut les
racines musicales latino-américaines selon une perspective internationale et offre
un accès à toutes les classes sociales, cultures et religions dans le but de
promouvoir la diversité et d’ouvrir une fenêtre à l’échange. Le camp allie
l’académique, l’artistique, les activitées culturelles, de plein air ainsi que
de saines habitudes de vie dans un contexte naturel exceptionnel.</p>
<p>Sept professeurs
reconnus d’Autriche et du Canada, incluant les membres du groupe canadien Color
Violeta, iront à faire de ce projet une réalité. Color Violeta a promu la
musique folklorique d'Amérique latine à travers le monde dans les cinq
dernières années.</p>

<p><b>QUAND, OÙ ET COMMENT SE DÉROULERA
MUSICAUSTRAL</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Le camp aura lieu à la
fin janvier 2016 à Frutillar Bajo au Chili, un petit village reconnu pour ses
traditions en musique classique, situé à 1000 kilomètres au sud de la capitale
de Santiago. </p>
<p>Cette première édition est
concue pour 10 jeunes musiciens âgés entre 18 et 23 ans, sélectionnés à partir
de leur mérite musical. Un part importante du projet est d’offrir un accès au
camp Musicaustral gratuit à de jeunes musiciens provenant de milieux
défavorisés. Les frais d’inscription de 250$US couverts par les autres
participants servirons à couvrir les frais des étudiants provenant de milieux
défavorisés. Le message derrière cette idée est de créer un esprit de
coopération entre les différentes classes sociales. </p>
<p><b>COMMENT LES FONDS SERONT UTILISÉS</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Chaque dollard investit
dans cette campagne va être utilisé pour supporter le démarrage de
Musicaustral. Le budget total est déjà couvert à 32% par l’équipe de musiciens
professionnels, les employés et la famille travaillant de pairs afin de
réaliser ce projet. La balance du budget d’un montant de 18 000$US va être couvert
par deux sources majeures: la campagne de sociofinancement Indiegogo (12 500$US)
et la balance sera couverte par des dons provenants d’entreprises privées et d’institutions
gouvernementales. </p>

<p>Inspiration musicale pour la structure académique du camp</p>
<p>Color
Violeta est un groupe basé sur les compositions de la grande folkloriste
chilienne Violetta Parra (1917-1967) arrangées par Daniel Emden. Color Violeta
révèle l’essence de la tradition musicale folklorique latino-américaine où les
rythmes comme la cueca, le festjo, le candombe, le huayno et la chacarera sont
fusionnés intelligeament et subtilement au jazz. Le succès du groupe tient de la
création d’une offre musicale moderne, originale et respectueuse de ses
racines. </p>
<blockquote>« J’ai comme mission de
promouvoir internationalement le folklore sud américain avec mon groupe
canadien, Color Violeta. Ensemble, nous avons assistés à des classes de maîtres
et des ateliers de folklore latino-américain dans cinq pays où nous avons
tournés. S’en est suivi de l’idée de créer un impact culturel important en
transportant nos connaissances musicales hors de la scène. Après des années
d’expériences musicales professionnelles et de multiples rencontres avec des
musiciens de talents au Canada, j’ai été agréablement surpris par la qualité
académique ainsi que de leurs expériences passées dans des camps musicaux.
C’est alors que j’ai décidé de m’impliquer dans plusieurs camps musicaux
canadiens avec la ferme intention d’importer une alternative éducationnelle aux
jeunes musiciens Chiliens afin qu’ils puissent connaître la valeur et la
richesse des racines musicales latino-américaines »<br/> Daniel Emden, Fondateur
de Musicaustral</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>NOUS AVONS BESOINS DE VOUS</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Nous allons créer une
tradition d’<i>empowerment</i> de jeunes
musiciens autant pour les communautées internationales que locales
d’enseignants en musique, de professeurs de yoga, de traducteurs, de cuisiniers
que de coordonnateurs de camps/projets. </p>

ABOUT THE PROJECT  
Musicaustral is a musical camp
designed for young musicians to develop and/or deepen their Latin-American musical
identity during a 10-day immersion in the amazing natural context of Frutillar
Bajo, Chile. We are on a mission to create musical encounters with recognized professional
musicians to support artistic creativity and empower young minds. 
In keeping with the legacy of the great
Chilean folk icon, Violeta Parra, Musicaustral promotes Latin-American roots music from an international perspective, and works to provide access to all
social classes and cultural backgrounds in order to promote
diversity and to create an open exchange. Combining elements of high education
with artistic and cultural activities, healthy life habits and recreation in
contact with the privileged local nature.
Seven recognized musicians and
teachers residing in Austria and Canada will be making their way to the south of Chile
to make this project a reality. Among those are the musicians of the Canadian
band Color Violeta, who have been promoting Latin American folkloric music
around the world for the past five years. 
OUR MISSION


Develop close working networks
between local and recognized international musicians.


Present the global reality of a musical career, and empower young practitioners to develop and establish a
professional beginning.


Guide the development of life
habits to support a sustainable career at the emotional and physical level through
the practice of yoga and healthy eating.


Implement activities to promote the
development of Latin American roots music in all social classes.



WHEN, WHERE & HOW 
The camp will be held at the end of
January 2016 in Frutillar Bajo, Chile. A small village 1000 kilometers south
from the capital, Santiago, renowned for its classical music tradition.
This 1st edition is designed for 10
young musicians, aged 18 to 23, selected by their musical merit. An important
part of this project is to be able to grant students from low-income families a 100% scholarship. The accessible fee of $USD 250 covered
by other students will cover the full scholarships. The message behind this
idea is to create a sense of cooperation between different social classes. 

WHERE THE MONEY IS USED
Every dollar that you pledge will go
towards supporting the successful implementation of Musicaustral. The budget is already 32% funded, covered by the kind donation of the team of professional
musicians, staff and family working to make this project a reality.  The remaining budget of $US 18,000 will be
covered by two major sources: this Indiegogo crowdfunding
campaign ($US 12,500), and the balance by donations from private businesses and
government institutions. Breakdown of the costs to be covered by your constribution:

Color Violeta  |
www.colorvioleta.caMusical inspirations for the academic structure of the Camp
Color Violeta is a musical group
based on Daniel Emden's arrangements of the compositions of the great Chilean
folk musician Violeta Parra (1917-1967). Color Violeta reveal the essence of
Latin American traditional folk music, where rhythms such as the cueca,
festejo, candombe, huayno and chacarera are fused intelligently and subtly with
jazz.  In this way, the group succeeds in creating a musical offering that
is modern and original, yet respectful of its roots.
“ I started the mission of internationally promoting
internationally South American folklore with my Canadian band, Color Violeta.
Together we have given master classes and workshops about Latin American
folklore music in the five countries we have toured, which has triggered the
idea of making a stronger cultural impact by bringing our understanding of
musical education outside of the stage. After years of professional music
experience and numerous encounters with talented young musicians in Canada, I
was amazed by the quality of their academic training and their experiences in
recognized musical camps and residences. So I decided to participate in
different camps with the firm idea of importing to Chile an alternative
educational system for young musicians where they can see the value and
richness of Latin American’s root music”.      Daniel Emden, Founder of Musicaustral 

WE NEED YOU
We are creating a tradition for the
enrichment of young musicians, as well as for the international and local
community of musical teachers, health practitioners, performers, cooks, and camp coordinators. 
CAMPAIGN TIME-LINE
ACADEMIC STRUCTURE 
The main characteristic of our
learning system is the constant access and exchange with teachers dedicated to
guide the student to identify his/her strength and musical potential. The main
musical activities will include:


Individual classes, one-on-one, on the main instruments: guitar, quena, charango or sicus,
double bass, percussion and voice


Group classes
(musical theory, Latin-American rhythms, improvisation, songwriting, ensemble
practice and pedagogy sessions)


Personal practices & ensemble rehearsals


Public master classes


Public conferences


Final concert open to the community


A HEALTHY MUSICAL ENCOUNTER

The practice of yoga will be part of our
daily activities. Through the systematic techniques of yoga including breathing
exercises, postures, concentration, healthy meals, and relaxation we aim to
provide tools to support
a healthy career at the emotional and physical level. 

A professional musician is exposed to a
high degree of physical stress due to the demanding training, as well as mental
and emotional stress due to stage performance and self-confidence issues. Yoga can
help to reduce stress levels, as well as preventing injuries due to wrong
postures and repetitive movements during long periods of time.

El Campamento Musicaustral es un campamento
musical dirigido a jóvenes con conocimiento musical, para el desarrollo y/o
perfeccionamiento en el ámbito de la música popular latinoamericana. Esta experiencia tiene una
duración de 10 días de inmersión en el maravilloso contexto natural de
Frutillar Bajo, Chile. Tenemos como misión crear encuentros musicales con
reconocidos músicos profesionales para apoyar la creatividad artística y la
autonomía de los jóvenes. 
Siguiendo el legado del gran
ícono del folclor chileno y latinoamericano, Violeta Parra, Musicaustral
promueve la música de raíz latinoamericana desde una perspectiva internacional.
Igualmente trabaja para facilitar el acceso a todas las clases sociales y culturas, con el fin de promover la diversidad y crear un
espacio abierto al intercambio. Combinando elementos de educación superior con
actividades artísticas y culturales, hábitos de vida saludables y recreación en
contacto con la privilegiada naturaleza local.
Siete reconocidos músicos y
profesores residentes en Austria y Canadá viajarán al sur de Chile para
hacer de este proyecto una realidad. Entre ellos, los músicos de la banda
canadiense Color Violeta, quienes llevan cinco años promoviendo internacionalmente la música folclórica
latinoamericana.

Inspiraciones musicales y arreglos para la estructura
académica de Musicaustral
Color Violeta es un grupo musical
basado en los arreglos de Daniel Emden a las composiciones del gran ícono de la
música popular chilena y Latinoamericana Violeta Parra (1917-1967). Color
Violeta revela la esencia de la música popular tradicional de América Latina,
donde los ritmos como la cueca, el festejo, el candombe, el huayno y la
chacarera se fusionan de forma inteligente y sutil con el jazz. De esta manera,
el grupo logra la creación de una propuesta musical moderna y original, a su
vez, respetuosa de sus raíces.
""Comencé la misión de
promover internacionalmente el folclore Sudamericano con mi banda Color
Violeta. Juntos hemos impartido clases magistrales y talleres sobre música
folklórica latinoamericana en los cinco países donde hemos estado de gira.  De allí ha nacido la idea de hacer un impacto
cultural más fuerte y llevar nuestra comprensión y educación de la música de
raíz fuera del escenario. Después de años de experiencia profesional en la
carrera de la música y numerosos encuentros con jóvenes músicos talentosos en
Canadá, me quedé sorprendido por la calidad de su formación académica y sus
experiencias en campamentos y residencias musicales. Entonces me decidí a
participar en diferentes campamentos reconocidos con el firme propósito de
importar a Chile (repercutiendo en Latinoamérica) un sistema educativo
alternativo para jóvenes músicos, en el que puedan ver el valor y la riqueza de
la música de raíz de América Latina"". Daniel Emden, Fundador de
Musicaustral



TE NECESITAMOS
Estamos creando una tradición
para el enriquecimiento de músicos jóvenes, así como para la comunidad
internacional de profesores de música, profesionales de la salud,
intérpretes, cocineros, y coordinadores de proyecto / campamentos.
CRONOLOGÍA

ESTRUCTURA ACADÉMICA
La principal característica de
nuestro sistema de aprendizaje es el acceso e intercambio constante con
profesores dedicados a orientar al estudiante a identificar su potencial y
fortaleza musical. Las principales actividades musicales incluirán:
• Clases individuales,
uno-a-uno, en los principales instrumentos: guitarra, quena, charango o sicus,
contrabajo, percusión y voz
• Clases en grupo (teoría
musical, ritmos latinoamericanos, improvisación, composición, práctica de
conjunto y sesiones pedagógicas)
• Practica personal y ensayos
en ensamble
• Clases magistrales abiertas a la comunidad
• Conferencias abiertas a la comunidad
• Concierto final abierto a la
comunidad
UN ENCUENTRO MUSICAL SALUDABLE
La práctica del yoga será parte
de nuestras actividades diarias. A través de las técnicas sistemáticas de yoga,
incluyendo ejercicios de respiración, posturas, concentración, comidas
saludables, y la relajación, nuestro objetivo es ofrecer herramientas para
desarrollar una carrera saludable a nivel físico y emocional.
Un músico profesional se expone
a un alto grado de estrés físico debido a los exigentes entrenamientos diarios. Esto es equivalente al estrés de un deportista de alta competición, así como al estrés mental
y emocional en la práctica escénica. El yoga puede ayudar a reducir los niveles
de estrés, así como prevenir lesiones por posturas incorrectas y movimientos
repetitivos durante largos períodos de tiempo. De esta forma podemos preparar al músico para
que pueda disfrutar plena y conscientemente de su arte.

PREGUNTAS FRECUENTES
1- Por qué están realizando
este proyecto?
El equipo de Musicaustral viene
de diversas culturas, Austria, Chile, Perú, Bolivia, Canadá y Venezuela.
Tenemos la experiencia e influencia de diferentes culturas, que  han asentado una comprensión clara sobre el
impacto de la unión en la diversidad. A través de esta rica diversidad que se
encuentra en la música de raíz latinoamericana queremos enriquecer a músicos
jóvenes para ayudarles a encontrar sus propias raíces musicales y que estos a
su vez impacten en el desarrollo artístico de su entorno. La música popular
latinoamericana es única e inmensamente rica en su rítmica, deseamos proveer el
conocimiento de ella para que músicos puedan crear fusiones inteligentes con
otros estilos de su interés, sea lo clásico, pop, rock, etc. Para esto la
porción académica de Musicaustral es principal e intensiva. 
2- Cual es el costo del
campamento?
Una parte realmente importante
del proyecto es poder otorgar a los estudiantes la oportunidad de ser becados
en su totalidad, en el caso de venir de una familia de bajos ingresos (que se
evaluará a través de entrevistas y referencias). Los estudiantes/participantes
con capacidad económica de cubrir el costo, solo aportaran la módica suma de $
US 250, y con esto estarán ayudando a cubrir las becas completas de aquellos
talentos que no cuenten con el recurso monetario.
Nota: Musicaustral  recibe estudiantes de todo el mundo, aunque
no somos capaces de cubrir los gastos de transporte para las personas
provenientes del extranjero.

À PROPOS DU PROJET

Le Camp Musicaustral est un
camp destiné aux jeunes musiciens désirant développer et approfondir leur identité
musicale latino-américaine durant une immersion de 10 jours se déroulant sur un
site extraordinaire à Frutillar, au sud du Chili. Nous avons comme mission
d’ouvrir l’esprit des jeunes en créant des rencontres musicales, éducatives et
originales avec des musiciens professionnels et reconnus. 
Suivant les traces de
la grande folkloriste chilienne, Violeta Parra, Musicaustral promeut les
racines musicales latino-américaines selon une perspective internationale et offre
un accès à toutes les classes sociales, cultures et religions dans le but de
promouvoir la diversité et d’ouvrir une fenêtre à l’échange. Le camp allie
l’académique, l’artistique, les activitées culturelles, de plein air ainsi que
de saines habitudes de vie dans un contexte naturel exceptionnel.
Sept professeurs
reconnus d’Autriche et du Canada, incluant les membres du groupe canadien Color
Violeta, iront à faire de ce projet une réalité. Color Violeta a promu la
musique folklorique d'Amérique latine à travers le monde dans les cinq
dernières années.

NOTRE MISSION




Développer des liens durables entre des
musiciens locaux et reconnus internationallement.


Présenter une vision globale de la réalité
d’une carrière en musique et habiliter les jeunes musiciens à développer et
établir leur début de parcours professionnel.


Guider le développement d’habitudes de vie
favorisant une carrière en santé au niveau émotionnel et physique à travers la
pratique du yoga et d’une saine nutrition. 


Implanter des activitées favorisant le
développant des racines musicales latino-américaines au sein de toutes classes
sociales.


QUAND, OÙ ET COMMENT SE DÉROULERA
MUSICAUSTRAL

Le camp aura lieu à la
fin janvier 2016 à Frutillar Bajo au Chili, un petit village reconnu pour ses
traditions en musique classique, situé à 1000 kilomètres au sud de la capitale
de Santiago. 
Cette première édition est
concue pour 10 jeunes musiciens âgés entre 18 et 23 ans, sélectionnés à partir
de leur mérite musical. Un part importante du projet est d’offrir un accès au
camp Musicaustral gratuit à de jeunes musiciens provenant de milieux
défavorisés. Les frais d’inscription de 250$US couverts par les autres
participants servirons à couvrir les frais des étudiants provenant de milieux
défavorisés. Le message derrière cette idée est de créer un esprit de
coopération entre les différentes classes sociales. 
COMMENT LES FONDS SERONT UTILISÉS

Chaque dollard investit
dans cette campagne va être utilisé pour supporter le démarrage de
Musicaustral. Le budget total est déjà couvert à 32% par l’équipe de musiciens
professionnels, les employés et la famille travaillant de pairs afin de
réaliser ce projet. La balance du budget d’un montant de 18 000$US va être couvert
par deux sources majeures: la campagne de sociofinancement Indiegogo (12 500$US)
et la balance sera couverte par des dons provenants d’entreprises privées et d’institutions
gouvernementales.

Inspiration musicale pour la structure académique du camp
Color
Violeta est un groupe basé sur les compositions de la grande folkloriste
chilienne Violetta Parra (1917-1967) arrangées par Daniel Emden. Color Violeta
révèle l’essence de la tradition musicale folklorique latino-américaine où les
rythmes comme la cueca, le festjo, le candombe, le huayno et la chacarera sont
fusionnés intelligeament et subtilement au jazz. Le succès du groupe tient de la
création d’une offre musicale moderne, originale et respectueuse de ses
racines. 
« J’ai comme mission de
promouvoir internationalement le folklore sud américain avec mon groupe
canadien, Color Violeta. Ensemble, nous avons assistés à des classes de maîtres
et des ateliers de folklore latino-américain dans cinq pays où nous avons
tournés. S’en est suivi de l’idée de créer un impact culturel important en
transportant nos connaissances musicales hors de la scène. Après des années
d’expériences musicales professionnelles et de multiples rencontres avec des
musiciens de talents au Canada, j’ai été agréablement surpris par la qualité
académique ainsi que de leurs expériences passées dans des camps musicaux.
C’est alors que j’ai décidé de m’impliquer dans plusieurs camps musicaux
canadiens avec la ferme intention d’importer une alternative éducationnelle aux
jeunes musiciens Chiliens afin qu’ils puissent connaître la valeur et la
richesse des racines musicales latino-américaines » Daniel Emden, Fondateur
de Musicaustral


NOUS AVONS BESOINS DE VOUS

Nous allons créer une
tradition d’empowerment de jeunes
musiciens autant pour les communautées internationales que locales
d’enseignants en musique, de professeurs de yoga, de traducteurs, de cuisiniers
que de coordonnateurs de camps/projets. 
Faites partie
de cette tradition et aidez-nous à ouvrir l’esprit de ces jeunes musiciens!

STRUCTURE ACADÉMIQUE

La charactéristique
principale de ce programme académique est l’échange constant entre les étudiants
et les professeurs, aptes à identifier leurs forces et potentiels musicaux. 
Activités académiques
quotidiennes:



Leçons individuelles (cours privés aux
instruments principaux: guitare, charango, quena et sicus, contre-basse,
percussions et voix)


Cours de groupe (théorie musicale,
rythmes latino-américains, improvisation, composition, répétitions d’ensemble
et des sessions de teach-how-to-teach)


Pratique personnelle et
répétitions


Classes de maître


Conférences


Concert de clôture
ouvert au public


MUSIQUE ET BIEN ÊTRE

La pratique du yoga
fera partie des activitées quotidiennes. À travers des techniques de yoga
incluant des exercices de respirations, de postures, de concentration, de repas
santés et de relaxation, nous visons à outiller les jeunes à développer une
carrière saine tant au niveau physique que émotionnel.
Un musicien
professionnel est exposé à un degré élevé de stress physique due à la pratique
de l’instrument ainsi qu’à un stress mental et émotionnel attribuable à la
performance scénique. Le yoga peut aider à réduire le nieau de stress ainsi
qu’à prévenir les blessures causées par de mauvaises postures et  mouvements répétitifs sur de longues périodes.

We have more than 253 ethnic groups and languages and we represent one of the most fascinating and richest cultures in the world. But although we have abundant natural resources, most of us still live in poverty with lack of access to healthcare and education. </p>

<p><strong>The Impact </strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to empower West Papuans by creating an education system which is designed by and directed towards West Papuans. This project will not only benefit West Papuan children and young teachers but also communities of farmers and indigenous female weavers who have been struggling to survive in a world that they’re just recently introduced into. We believe education is the basic foundation to build a generation of Papuans who are critical, creative and innovative.</p>

About West Papua West Papua or previously known as Irian Jaya is a self-identifying term that refers to the provinces of Papua and West Papua, the remote and highly marginalized provinces of Indonesia. Roughly the size of California, our island is located in the western part of the world’s largest tropical island New Guinea. We have more than 253 ethnic groups and languages and we represent one of the most fascinating and richest cultures in the world. But although we have abundant natural resources, most of us still live in poverty with lack of access to healthcare and education. 
Facts:

West Papua consistently occupied the lowest rank of HDI in Indonesia;
West Papua is the poorest region among Indonesia’s 33 provinces; 
In Papua province, 100,000 out of the 400,000 children are not in school (Anderson 2013);
In 2011, Papua province had an illiteracy rate of 35.92%, the worst in the country (Elmslie 2013).






Our ProgramEvery teacher in GPM is a volunteer but we need help to recruit and train more teachers as we seek to expand our reach to broader communities in West Papua. Our goal is to raise $9,825. All the funds raised in this campaign will go towards :


sponsoring and recruiting new teachers --which will allow us to support the education of almost 100 indigenous children-- for a year.The goal for next year is to get an additional 10 teachers on board to serve two existing learning centers plus one new learning center;

training workshops for teachers. 



 The funds raised will help us in beginning our goal of building a sustainable, empowering, and West Papuan-oriented education, which will ultimately allow us to create more West Papuan leaders and intellectuals.






The Impact 
The purpose of this project is to empower West Papuans by creating an education system which is designed by and directed towards West Papuans. This project will not only benefit West Papuan children and young teachers but also communities of farmers and indigenous female weavers who have been struggling to survive in a world that they’re just recently introduced into. We believe education is the basic foundation to build a generation of Papuans who are critical, creative and innovative.



Other Ways You Can Help
There are many ways you can help Gerakan Papua Mengajar (GPM)! By giving a small donation you can make a big impact on our children in West Papua.  Additionally, you can share our campaign with your family and friends.  This will help us accomplish our goal and help bring awareness to those who care about the fate of indigenous communities with extremely rich cultures like West Papuans. We also receive donations of school supplies, storybooks for children (preferably in Indonesian), films, and other materials that may help expanding our mission.

</div>","In Short:Think of an auto rickshaw mixed with the car from Back to the Future. Add the tools from a maker space and the curriculum from a science or engineering class you wish you had in school. Now take that and set it in the heart of Mumbai. The Maker Auto will be a mobile link between the Makers’ Asylum (makersasylum.com)  and the greater community of Mumbai. We will be conducting workshops in collaboration with a variety of community groups, neighborhood associations, and nonprofit educational organizations from throughout the city.The Goal:The excitement and energy about innovation and building things in a makerspace is palpable, but how far can we extend that excitement? How can we bring that creativity energy to collaborations in the greater community of a Mumbai? India has countless people who make their living building things, but physical building activities are not often viewed as a respectable career path. Handwork is often associated with low wages and is not respected by many of India’s educated elite. Can we show the greater community that making and building things by is an essential part of some of the best innovations? Let’s work together to build a mobile platform for making collaboration to expand our community of changemakers.Recipe:Start with an auto rickshaw base.Cut it in two equal sized chunks and remove the engine.Stretch the two parts and recombine with engine. Add two to four excited makers, a whole cabinet of high-tech tools, a few generous pinches of creativity, and a dash of adventuresome spirit.Mix well.Best if served fresh with a group of external collaborators.Use:After making an auto into the ultimate mobile maker space we will be conducting workshops with various groups around Mumbai and the surrounding area. Each individual project’s scope will remain flexible and change based on the group of collaborators we are working with. If we are working with a youth music program we can build DIY musical instruments. If we are working with medical students we can build assistive technology. With a neighborhood association we can build public furniture or playground equipment. A tech company can learn about 3D scanning and printing and an engineering class can learn about the power of user-centered design.Who We Are:As self-identified members of a ‘maker movement’ we seek out opportunities to take initiative and make change where we see fit.

Do you have a passion for making that you want to share with others in your community? Do you work well with others? Do you have skills that you are eager to share? If so, we want you on our team.Secondly, we need to buy materials and parts for the build. This includes an auto frame, a stronger engine, lots of other bits of steel, a completely new canopy, toolboxes, and a bunch of tools. Also, the intention is to offer the workshops from the Maker Auto for free, so we’ll need to buy materials for classes as well. This is a project for the community by the community. If you think making and building is something more people should have access, one way to show your support is by donating tools, equipment, or funds to the project. If we can get small donations from a large group of people we’ll be able to really make some great things happen.Rewards:Here are what some of the rewards will look like.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

Spoiler alert, there’s a lot of information we are eager to give you, but we thought starting with a summary of the What?, Why?  and Who? of the project will give you a good start!<br/><br/><b>What is the iUNITE™ platform?</b><br/>iUNITE™ will be a software application designed to leverage real-time language translation, face recognition and mapping technology to produce a unique and effective learning experience through a culturally enriched music curriculum. The software will allow students from different parts of the world the ability to have direct hands-on communication with another group without the language differences being an issue. Real-time language translation will not only help motivate the students to engage, but it will open the doors of opportunity for groups of students to expand their knowledge of the world beyond their own communities and give them the chance to celebrate their own culture by teaching others about it, through their cultures music. The iUNITE platform is an innovative way to use real-time language translation technology to break down the language barrier on an educational level and we’re building a network of schools and youth organizations that will participate in the iUNITE platform. Did we mention, it’s pretty cool!<br/><br/><b>Why are we building the iUNITE platform?</b><br/>There’s a quote by Nelson Mandela where he says “Education is the most powerful weapon, which you can use to change the world”. We strongly believe in Nelson Mandela’s message and feel that the education he spoke of is not limited to just your regular schooling, but is a starting point for a very vast category of education. We feel one of the most powerful influences in the world is music. Historically known as the universal language because it transcends cultures, it speaks to people regardless of their spoken language. It inspires, encourages, and makes you feel. We are going to build the iUNITE platform to allow students around the world the opportunity to explore worlds outside of the world they’re use to. In this day and age, we have great opportunity to use the advance technology available to us to bridge the gap between cities, countries and cultures. There’s a heavy sense of isolation, people are unknowledgeable of the world around them, misinformed and in many cases ignorant towards cultures other than their own. It breeds fear, ignorance and war. We feel it’s simple. Technology has granted us the open door to communicate in real time to someone on the other side of the planet, so why not develop a platform that can provide an educational system that allows younger students the ability to learn about any culture they want, directly from a group of students within that culture? Doing so can start the shift of ignorance to factual knowledge, in which can shift the way generations start to think about the world outside of their own and start to erase that fear and build open communication for generations to come.<br/> <br/><b>Why do we need the money?</b><br/>We need to start beta testing the iUNITE platform and In order to do that we need to hire the engineers and programers who can build out the software and run the testing. The funds raised will allow us to secure the right development team, help towards finalizing our marketing material and allow us to bring on more schools and youth organizations, which involves traveling and supporting a small team.<br/><br/><b>Who’s behind the iUNITE platform?</b><br/>We’re not engineers, programers or silicon valley guys (Though we have a healthy love for tech, education and music :). We are a team of motivated individuals, led by two visionaries from the Bronx, NY who have a passion to do good in this world. Daimion John Peppers is a creative director, designer and web developer who started off in music entertainment and business management industries. Justin “Jus” Rolle is an entertainer, motivational life balance coach, who studied marketing and management. Together they co-own and operate micheck entertainment llc which is the company developing the iUNITE platform. micheck entertainment llc is a small entertainment company that started off in promotions and grew into artist management, strategic marketing and digital media design.

Sadly, no. </p>
<p>Glassdoor.com does a great job of showing reviews for full-time positions, but not very effectively for internships.  Online internship posting platforms like Indeed.com and Internships.com display job descriptions but with no authentic intern testimonial about what to really expect.  The Internwire.com founding team lived this experience across multiple universities, and vowed to deliver the platform that provides a complete solution to the internship process- <b>completely free for students.</b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We have the Internet, and we're not afraid to use it!</span><br/></p>
<p>Millions of university students across America use Ratemyprofessors.com to hand-select the best-reviewed professors before scheduling their classes.  It is time that students have a platform that offers the exact same power when seeking internships!  InternWire.com is that platform.  Now students everywhere will have the ability to post internship reviews, and enjoy reviews across any industry, any major, at any time.  It is time that every university student knows all of their options, and <b>chooses their career from abundance instead of scarcity.</b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">But our improvement in internship clarity doesn't end there! We understand that today's college students are much more interested in tapping through Snapchat stories than reading through generic company descriptions.  To best serve the interns of today, we are also becoming the first platform to show students </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">internship opportunity videos</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> from inside the company's walls.  At last! You as a student will know what your desk might look like, what sense of humor your boss has, and hear straight from the program manager about future career opportunities an intern at that company can expect.</span><br/></p>
<p>With the help of your contribution, we will be able to launch and spread InternWire.com to university students across America.  This means <b>thousands and thousands </b><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>of reviews</b> for students to efficiently search and filter through, and quickly find the direction to the career of their dreams!</span></p> </div> <div> <h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">A Viable Business Model</span><br/>
</h3>
</div><div> <p>It is important to note that this is not just a charity effort for students. InternWire.com has a viable, validated business model consisting of five steps:</p>
<p><b>Step 1)</b> Create a free and incredibly helpful platform for university students seeking internships.</p>
<p><b>Step 2)</b> Use modern marketing techniques to reach university students in order to generate lots and lots of intern traffic on InternWire.com.</p>
<p><b>Step 3)</b> Sell opportunities for employers to advertise their programs more effectively to the intern population on InternWire.com, at a lower cost than current intern advertisement methods.</p>
<p><b>Step 4)</b> Reinvest in the company, continuously perfecting a platform that positively impacts the career decisions of thousands of students.</p>
<p><b>Step 5)</b> Donate a dollar for every review to charity Pencils of Promise, in order to spread the gift of education throughout the Human Family.</p>

<h3>Together We Can</h3>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">InternWire.com is seeking to accomplish our $15,000 goal in order to offset a significant portion of our website development costs.  By getting debt out of the way, we will be able to launch our site and then use subsequent advertisement revenue directly towards spreading the word of InternWire.com to college campuses across America.  We have worked hard to make sure that InternWire.com is the right product to totally satisfy the needs of university students when it is delivered. Your donation allows that delivery to happen.</span><br/></p>
<p>If we do not reach our fundraising goal, we will have to significantly delay launch of our website in order to first pay off our debts.  This is why every donation is cherished!  If you believe in the platform described above, and believe that it would be useful to either yourself or a student you know, we would greatly appreciate you backing your belief with a donation, and sharing this page.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We know that money doesn't grow on trees.  If you truly cannot donate, please text a link to this campaign to someone who you believe could contribute.  Nearly everyone has either had an internship, is looking for an internship, or knows someone who is.  You are a rockstar!</p>
</div></div>","Summary Think of the college career fair experience for a minute.  Imagine yourself back in those fancy shoes, the long lines, the mechanical responses to the same generic questions, your sweaty palms, and your feigned interest in booth after booth.  How could you possibly know what the job was really going to be like in this setting?  You could throw a dart, and be well on your way to a career you guessed at.  Or you could look for a better way online.  Surely there were useful intern testimonials somewhere online right? Sadly, no. 
Glassdoor.com does a great job of showing reviews for full-time positions, but not very effectively for internships.  Online internship posting platforms like Indeed.com and Internships.com display job descriptions but with no authentic intern testimonial about what to really expect.  The Internwire.com founding team lived this experience across multiple universities, and vowed to deliver the platform that provides a complete solution to the internship process- completely free for students.
We have the Internet, and we're not afraid to use it!
Millions of university students across America use Ratemyprofessors.com to hand-select the best-reviewed professors before scheduling their classes.  It is time that students have a platform that offers the exact same power when seeking internships!  InternWire.com is that platform.  Now students everywhere will have the ability to post internship reviews, and enjoy reviews across any industry, any major, at any time.  It is time that every university student knows all of their options, and chooses their career from abundance instead of scarcity.
But our improvement in internship clarity doesn't end there! We understand that today's college students are much more interested in tapping through Snapchat stories than reading through generic company descriptions.  To best serve the interns of today, we are also becoming the first platform to show students internship opportunity videos from inside the company's walls.  At last! You as a student will know what your desk might look like, what sense of humor your boss has, and hear straight from the program manager about future career opportunities an intern at that company can expect.
With the help of your contribution, we will be able to launch and spread InternWire.com to university students across America.  This means thousands and thousands of reviews for students to efficiently search and filter through, and quickly find the direction to the career of their dreams!   
A Viable Business Model

 It is important to note that this is not just a charity effort for students. InternWire.com has a viable, validated business model consisting of five steps:
Step 1) Create a free and incredibly helpful platform for university students seeking internships.
Step 2) Use modern marketing techniques to reach university students in order to generate lots and lots of intern traffic on InternWire.com.
Step 3) Sell opportunities for employers to advertise their programs more effectively to the intern population on InternWire.com, at a lower cost than current intern advertisement methods.
Step 4) Reinvest in the company, continuously perfecting a platform that positively impacts the career decisions of thousands of students.
Step 5) Donate a dollar for every review to charity Pencils of Promise, in order to spread the gift of education throughout the Human Family.
As of August 2016, InternWire is nearly finished with Step 1!  Our beautifully designed website (we like to call it InternWire.com 2.0) will be totally finished by early September, just in time for students to prepare before career fair season.  See work-in-progress pictures of the new site below!  Special thanks to our contracted development company BlGrafika for their expertise and hard work, as well as Brianna Branco who is our Marketing and Design genius.  Sorry employers, she's ours and you can't have her.

<p>PepperSpray's objective is to continue the tradition of providing independent, non-commercial news and information. Our way of doing that is centered around media diversity.

<p>When the original PepperSpray Productions officially disbanded, a few video projects had been started that subsequently were left unfinished. As part of PepperSpray's re-birth, completing these are a priority. The three main projects focus on homelessness in Seattle, the election process, and local organization, <a href=""http://seasol.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Seattle Solidarity Network</a> (SeaSol). The footage for these is gathered, they just need to be edited together.</p>
<p>In addition to completing PepperSpray's former projects and continuing some of its traditions, PSM has also started new media series and brands that an audience is being built for. With its biggest expense covered by this funding PSM can afford to expand its membership and start an internship program to help complete these planned projects and create more.</p>

<h3>PepperSpray Productions projects</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Homeless in Seattle</strong> - This started as a documentary about homelessness in Seattle and how it relates to homelessness in the nation as a whole. A lot of footage was gathered for this project from protest, interviews with homeless Seattle residents and activists as well as a few crucial moments from Nicklesville. This footage could best be used for a web series about homelessness rather than one documentary. It would be more immediate and allow the project to tell more about the issues of homelessness in the city.</li>
<li>
<strong>the election process</strong> - This project is an examination of the American electoral process and history. It started as a small piece on the election process, but with the wide range of footage gathered from the historic 2008 election of Barack Obama to expert interviews on gerrymandering the project ballooned into a larger more in-depth piece. This is now something that would be more effective as a web series and political activist platform.</li>
<li>
<strong>Seattle Solidarity (<a href=""http://seasol.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sea Sol</a>) project</strong> - This documentary about the activist collective was suspended in the middle of post-production. PSM intends on finishing the production and use it as a launching pad for a web series that can draw attention to different campaigns carried out by <a href=""http://seasol.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sea Sol</a>.</li>

</p>
<p>Mammography
is recognized as the best preventative screening tool to image the

Cancer shows up in white in mammography and so does dense breast

<p>While
insurance companies can make it difficult to have access to
Ultrasound; that is unless something is seen on a Mammography

<p>A

<p>

<p>The

<p>Breast Density Notification Laws by State — Breast density notification 
laws have been put into effect in 27 states. A breast density 
notification law requires that physicians notify women who have 
undergone mammography and were found to have dense breast tissue. The 
intent of such a law was to give women the necessary information to 
decide on further action if they had dense breast tissue. Dense breast 
tissue makes it harder to identify cancer on a mammogram and may also be
 associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, according to the 
American College of Radiology (ACR). Women with dense breasts are 
encouraged to discuss with their physicians their possible increased 
risk of breast cancer and the difficulty that mammography may have in 
detecting tumors.<br/></p>

faced numerous challenges but was able to cope because of his talent in music
namely writing rap songs. I was able to get him a partial scholarship from a

2015 &amp; Feb.-June 2016. </p>
<p>The plan is basically to find 150 people

<p><b><i>Meeting Joker...</i></b></p>
<p>When I first
met Mohammad Saraddeh (aka Joker) he was 16 years old. I met him as part of a project I have been
working for at <a href=""http://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/jordan/camp-profiles?field=13"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Talbieh
Camp</a>, a
Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan. He immediately captured my heart with his warm
smile and positive attitude. At that time, Joker had been out of school for
around two years and he was at great risk given the harsh conditions at the camp and his
particular circumstances. A team of committed individuals and I worked with
Joker to help him return to school and successfully finish the tenth grade
which is considered a crucial milestone in the Jordanian educational system. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436183455/gx5lcfenwtnrr6jimfd3.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 506.00988700565px; height: 685px;""/></p><br/>
<p><b><i>Joker continues to light...</i></b></p>
<p>Joker’s
passion has always rested in rapping. He wrote rap songs that helped him cope
with hardships, and allowed him to express his thoughts about injustices that
he has perceived around him and challenge stereotypes about his community – the
refugee community. In a song he wrote to respond to people who discriminate against
camp dwellers and perceive youth in the camps as lazy, unintelligent, criminal,
and alien Joker says: </p>
<p></p>
<p><i>In our camp we have
creative youth </i></p>
<p><i>If the night falls,
they continue to light </i></p>
<p>...and

will not be able to pursue his studies unless with financial support from

</div></div>","Short SummaryMohammad Saradeeh, aka Joker has
faced numerous challenges but was able to cope because of his talent in music
namely writing rap songs. I was able to get him a partial scholarship from a
folk school in Denmark last year, and collected an amount to send him to
Denmark to study music for 4 months - around the same time of the year last
year. They loved him and gave him two additional partial scholarships Jan-June
2015 & Feb.-June 2016. 
The plan is basically to find 150 people
who are willing to donate each USD100 and on their turn ask three people to do
the same. This way we’ll be able to fundraise what should also cover his
university education in music. 
The funds will be received and
managed by IBDAA (a credible NGO in Jordan). Below is more details about Joker,
breakdown of the amount to be collected and IBDAA. 
You can help through one or more
of the following: 
1) 
donating an amount of
USD100 
2) 
Finding three other
friends/relatives willing to donate the amount of USD100 each 
3) 
Sharing the campaign and
updates via social media platforms at least twice a week 
4) 
Finding 10 people who are
willing to donate each USD100
Please skim through the brief
Story below! 
Thank you! The Story

Meeting Joker...
When I first
met Mohammad Saraddeh (aka Joker) he was 16 years old. I met him as part of a project I have been
working for at Talbieh
Camp, a
Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan. He immediately captured my heart with his warm
smile and positive attitude. At that time, Joker had been out of school for
around two years and he was at great risk given the harsh conditions at the camp and his
particular circumstances. A team of committed individuals and I worked with
Joker to help him return to school and successfully finish the tenth grade
which is considered a crucial milestone in the Jordanian educational system. 
Joker continues to light...
Joker’s
passion has always rested in rapping. He wrote rap songs that helped him cope
with hardships, and allowed him to express his thoughts about injustices that
he has perceived around him and challenge stereotypes about his community – the
refugee community. In a song he wrote to respond to people who discriminate against
camp dwellers and perceive youth in the camps as lazy, unintelligent, criminal,
and alien Joker says: 

In our camp we have
creative youth 
If the night falls,
they continue to light 
...and
Joker’s creativity paid off. It took him back to school, helped him produce a
small music album with support of the project that we ran in the camp, and made
people believe in his talent. Joker performing in Amman, Jordan during an event aimed at raising awareness on the conservation of the environment. Joker performing in Amman, Jordan for an event that aimed at making some Syrian refugee children happy. Joker performing in Amman, Jordan during an event aimed at raising awareness on the conservation of the environment. He received a generous partial scholarship from a
folk school in Denmark (Brandbjerg Hojskole) to attend one semester
from August to Dec. 2014. Joker was able to attend such an opportunity through
the help of individual friends, who either met or heard from me about him, covering
his travel costs, pocket money and the remaining amount of the tuition. While
for some this is a valuable learning opportunity, for Joker it has been rather a
life saving opportunity.  Joker made me
and all of those who believed in him proud. His teachers and the Brandbjerg
school staff have been very happy with his performance. He has also started
already paying back to society by helping with Syrian refugees in Denmark
through his school. So the school decided to give him another partial
scholarship to attend one more semester Jan-June 2015 and another one from
Feb.June 2016! 
While this is
great news, it is not enough. Joker needs to feel there is hope he will be able
to follow his dream and study music.  Studying
music in Jordan is almost as costly as it is in some countries in Europe. Joker
will not be able to pursue his studies unless with financial support from
people who are willing to help.   So what if Joker does not complete his
education?
I have seen many bright youth in the camp lose hope and with it any
aspiration because of poverty. Although I believe Joker has demonstrated
strength and perseverance, statistics remain alarming according to a  FAFO
survey of Jordan’s Palestinian refugee camps: 
Only half of 16 and 17-year olds enrolled in secondary education 
Only six per cent of both women and men in the age group 30 to 34
have a university degree

Only 11 per cent of both women and men in the age group 25 to 29
have a university degree
31 per cent are poor in households where the highest level of education attained is
secondary schooling 
Why Joker?
When I first met Joker, he was the one at most risk among the group of
youth we worked with. Most of the others were at school or about to finish high
school and enroll in university. He also showed great potential and talent.
While there are many Jokers in the camp, with individual efforts we only have
the capacity to work with one of them in terms of longer term education. I hope
by achieving significant success in this campaign you will be telling me that
there is hope we will be able to support more of the Jokers! (Joker visiting injured
Syrian refugee children in Jordan- permission obtained from family of the Syrian child to use the photo) Impact
 Pay it forward...
Imagine a
world where every young talent enjoys the ability to exercise the right to
education without exclusion. While this campaign is not about numbers in terms
of impact, but I hope it is seen as a campaign about a life and a small, but
important, part of the effort to achieve education for every gifted person
deprived of financial means. Joker is the older brother and very committed
towards his family and siblings. If you choose to support Joker you will be
helping him support his own siblings and their education.

<p><b>We are excited to announce that the Rio Rancho Rotary club made a generous grant donation of $1000 towards our project! </b></p>
<p>Casa Xalteva (CX) is a non-profit
Spanish language school and educational shelter for underprivileged youth in
Granada, Nicaragua. They provide Nicaraguan children and teens with scholarships
and the tools needed to become responsible, productive individuals that can
share these positive attributes with the local community. CX assists youth in
achieving their goals with educational, emotional, and social support.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Children from ages 6 to 18 come to CX from varied circumstances.  They come from homes with dirt floors which do not have entire walls or roofs; or homes that, at any given time may
or may not have running water or electricity. Many come from broken homes and
do not have any communication or
support from their parents.</p>
<p>At the most basic level CX
provides a safe, positive environment for children and teens to spend their
free time. In Nicaragua, one-third of all children never enroll in school, have
poor attendance or drop out before the sixth grade. Most of these children do
not learn the necessary reading and math skills to succeed in life
discontinuing before completing the first grade. Malnutrition, teenage pregnancy,
early marriages, child trafficking, sexual exploitation, and gang involvement
also threaten the well-being of Nicaraguan youth.  </p>
<p>Casa Xalteva is a loving community and
the children come either in the morning or the afternoon, before or after going
to school. CX provides a balanced breakfast and lunch that wouldn’t typically be
received in the home.  Lead Teacher Larry
Roblero and Children’s Welfare Coordinator Jazmin Rose Tinsley, guide and help the
children with their homework, research, and other tasks for school. On a daily
basis the children practice teamwork, leadership, non-violence, tolerance, and
respect for all through a varied and dynamic program, to help the children
become happy, healthy adults that have skills to build changes in their
community and to break the poverty cycle. The children's involvement with
international students and volunteers from all around the world gives them an
intercultural awareness that helps cultivate a healthy, global view. This helps
reinforce subjects taught in school, introduce entirely new experiences, and
foster team building. The education does not end with the students; CX has recently established strong relationships with the parents and families to
continue these practices in the home and the community.</p>

<p>An important part of the program is to provide a healthy lunch for all children at Casa Xalteva on a
daily basis. In Nicaragua, one of the main reasons for school drop out is
tardiness and lack of attendance.  A
majority of schools close their doors to children that arrive more than 15
minutes late.  Therefore, it is extremely
important to make sure lunch is ready on time and the children do not
have to rush to finish their food before heading to school.  The kitchen, which has served for almost
20 years, is worn out and cannot keep up with cooking demands.  The burners are old and function too
slowly to cook basic dishes in a timely manner and the refrigerator is too
small to store enough food for the week. There are currently 27 children in the program and by next year they would like to expand.  For that to become a reality, they need to
purchase new appliances and replace the old, broken cabinetry.  </p>
<p>Our project will greatly benefit the children of Casa
Xalteva by making sure their lunch is ready early enough that the students are
able to eat in a relaxed fashion before heading off to school in the afternoon.  The larger fridge will also reduce food waste
by keeping more food fresh thus<b> </b>saving
money that can be reinvested in the children’s program.   </p>
<p>The total cost of implementation of the new kitchen is $5,600. 
This amount will include the purchase of a larger refrigerator, a three-burner stove with oven, new cabinets and counter top, and the labor
required to install and/or construct each item.  </p>
<p><b>We are excited about the prospect of the new kitchen for Casa Xalteva and are extremely thankful for your support! Thank you! Muchísimas gracias!</b> </p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help:</p>
<p>Come take Spanish classes at Casa Xalteva! Or tell your friends! Come volunteer with the children's program! Help them with homework, teach English, or bring any of your favorite hobbies and share them with the kids! </p>
<p><b>Also, PLEASE SHARE our campaign with your family and friends! Let's make sure CX can build their new kitchen and expand to support more children in 2015 and beyond! </b></p>

<p>Canadians and Egyptians are working together to discover the past and forging important bonds for the future through common restoration projects.
You will be doing so much more than helping out a team of young Canadian
scholars.</p>
<p>Help Canadians uncover and restore the secrets of one of the
most significant archaeological sites in Egypt by sponsoring the restoration of an Egyptian
temple.</p>
<p>The Canadian Institute in Egypt is sending a Canadian team
of technicians from the University of Toronto,
Canada, to join the Institute’s team at Tel er-Rub’a (Mendes), Egypt in 2015,
120 miles north of Cairo. The Tel er-Rub’a site is unique: it has the tallest
building north of Cairo and south of Alexandria. This building (the naos – see
photograph) needs restoration. On June 9, 2014, a meeting was held at the
Mendes dig house. It was decided:</p>
<p>1.  The restoration of
the naos would require heavy equipment, such as cranes, front loaders, heavy
trucks, generators. These could not be allowed to run over ancient antiquities,
delicate and fragile, which have to be preserved.</p>
<p>2.  Therefore the team has to excavate east, west, and south of the naos to (a) make
sure no important remains lie under the surface in these areas, and (b) to
prepare a solid bed for the heavy equipment.</p>
<p>This is where you come in. 
Before proceeding with the actual restoration by architects and
engineers, these future archaeologists, under the guidance of Professors Donald
and Susan Redford’s field school at Mendes, have to ensure that no artifact is
left behind. Who knows what other secrets these budding Canadian archaeologists
will find?</p>
<p>Even the smallest donation can help these future
archaeologists and the team to achieve their goal.  You will be doing so much more than helping
out a team of young scholars.  You will
be fostering relations between Canada and Egypt in real, tangible ways.<br/></p>
<h1>What we need and what you get</h1>
<p>The team needs $8,000. Sponsor a team member, or a portion
of the restoration project. Sponsorships range from $5 (for 15 minutes of
excavation) to $1,000 (the costs of a participating team member). The funds will be equally divided among the participants to help with the airfare and living expenses of the dig. <br/></p>

<p>Solar Rollers, a non-profit energy education program, develops engineering design concepts at the high school level.
Competitive, creative high school design teams  are racing to build and design the fastest,
most efficient, solar powered remote controlled racecar.  Utilizing only the power of the sun, the teams
will compete in technical knowledge, endurance with solar power only, and
good old fashioned competitive racing</p>
<p>This award-winning program is already well
established in Colorado. The Solar Rollers are looking to grow into Texas.  I would like to
see it extend its reach to the high schools in Austin area for the 2015 season.
 There are at least 8 high school teams actively interested
in developing in the Austin area already. 
</p>
<p>To make this program really
take off, the Solar Rollers are looking for several sponsors that are interested in renewable energy, engineering design,
electronics, and construction of R/C solar powered cars and the arrays to power
them. The standard solar R/C race kit typically with all components start out around $1,000.  Each school is encouraged to fund raise to earn this.  We also need sponsors for the Trophy Race Event, about $11,000. </p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Who am I? </span></p>
<p>Anthony Parker is a local high school student at Khabele Strong in Austin Texas.  I was part of the group of students who
helped launched the Solar Rollers program in Carbondale, CO, in 2012.  I then organized and led my own high school

</div></div>","Short Summary

Solar Rollers, a non-profit energy education program, develops engineering design concepts at the high school level.
Competitive, creative high school design teams  are racing to build and design the fastest,
most efficient, solar powered remote controlled racecar.  Utilizing only the power of the sun, the teams
will compete in technical knowledge, endurance with solar power only, and
good old fashioned competitive racing
This award-winning program is already well
established in Colorado. The Solar Rollers are looking to grow into Texas.  I would like to
see it extend its reach to the high schools in Austin area for the 2015 season.
 There are at least 8 high school teams actively interested
in developing in the Austin area already. 

To make this program really
take off, the Solar Rollers are looking for several sponsors that are interested in renewable energy, engineering design,
electronics, and construction of R/C solar powered cars and the arrays to power
them. The standard solar R/C race kit typically with all components start out around $1,000.  Each school is encouraged to fund raise to earn this.  We also need sponsors for the Trophy Race Event, about $11,000. Who am I? 
Anthony Parker is a local high school student at Khabele Strong in Austin Texas.  I was part of the group of students who
helped launched the Solar Rollers program in Carbondale, CO, in 2012.  I then organized and led my own high school
team last year.  Now I would like to lead
the way in launching this program in Austin, Texas. Building the Solar powered race cars was not only fun but I learned advanced mathematics, physics, engineering, design, teamwork, and the list just goes on and on. But the bottom line is we are the future of the world and we are looking to you, the current leaders of the world, to help us. 
What We Need & What You Get   We need the $11,000 simply to pay for the Race Day Event.    Even if you can't give much to our cause, every dollar counts; and we will thank you profusely if all you can do is support us.
Your sponsorship will he honored on our Web site and on the Game day program.
The top 5 sponsors can hang a banner on Race Day at our event. Until our $11,000 goal is met nothing can be done with solar powered racing in Austin. The money you so generously donate to us will be placed in an escrow account until the goal is met.    The Impact 
By donating to start this project you will be making a considerable contribution to the education system. We high school students, are so in need of things to do that are fun yet complicated.    As a highschooler you don't get many chances to make an impact, so I helped create the Solar Rollers program to impact the lives of Hundreds.     Risks & Challenges  The biggest risk is that we are unable to begin this project for the 2014-15 year.  We will have to aim for the 2015-16 year instead.  My biggest challenge is that I may run out of time to personally check on each team and answer questions.  After we have been generously funded, the Solar Rollers program will eventually  reach out to a total of four states. With a goal of all the high schools in the world that this doesn't seem like much. But I am confident that with your help we could extend our reach across the globe.   Other Ways You Can Help If you can't donate, no sweat, spreading the word to your friends and family is another way you can help.

Our goal is to teach 200,000 Canadian women and youth to code by 2020.</p>
<p>We run one-day workshops for adults in 22+ cities (and counting) across Canada plus Girls Learning Code and Kids Learning Code, which are thriving youth programs for youth ages 6-17.</p>
<p>To date, we’ve taught over 24,000 women and youth in one of our programs across the country. It is exciting and heartening to know that Canadians of all backgrounds are getting a first taste of coding at our workshops, and leaving the event with a greater sense of self-confidence.

But to sustain this initiative, we need to engage teachers, parents and community members across the country.  All donations, regardless of the amount, help further our mission and allow us to reach more students.  Specifically, your financial contributions will help to get the code:mobile on the road and make the cross-Canada journey! Your support will help make our trip possible by contributing to costs associated with bringing on amazing team to deliver workshops across the country next Summer and by helping to cover operating costs like gas, parking, accommodations, insurance, CAA, regular maintenance checks and more. All of the important things that will keep the code:mobile trucking along. </p>

Think: a travelling computer lab on wheels (Canada's first coding truck)! But, it’s more than just a truck or a computer lab. It’s a cross-Canada journey that will bring hands-on, interactive technology education to Canadian youth.  We believe that computer programming and other technical skills are a tool of empowerment, and it is our mission at Ladies Learning Code to ensure that all Canadians -- particularly women and youth -- have access to these learning opportunities.  And, we need YOUR help! From May to September 2016, we want to visit our 22+ Chapter cities across Canada plus their surrounding cities and towns based on community requests. We’ll visit large and small communities, in privileged and underprivileged communities alike, stopping by at local parks, community centres, Summer Camps, street festivals, aboriginal reserves, hospitals and anywhere else we can park the truck and pop-up our lab. If we reach our funding goal, we estimate we'll travel approximately 35,000km coast to coast teaching over 10,000 kids to code next Summer! Help us inspire and teach kids that code has the power to change the world.

WHY DOES THIS MATTER? WHY TEACH CODE? Technology is everywhere and it’s not going anywhere. We want to equip Canadian youth with the critical skills they need to navigate the world we live in today and thrive in the future. We think it’s important for youth to learn to code for a few reasons:
Coding is a superpower. Learning to code let’s kids build -- not just consume the technology around them like video games, websites, robots and more. 
Coding helps kids develop new ways of thinking and foster problem-solving techniques that gives kids a competitive advantage when applying to colleges, internships or jobs - they are valuable skills that are in high demand. 
Coding helps kids understand the world around them better. If we teach biology and mathematics in order to understand the world around them, then knowing the basics of how computers communicate - and how to engage with them -should be a given.
Coding can help change the world empower kids to use technology as a creative tool to build solutions for problems or challenges people face everyday.
Coding is fun!  We want kids to experience the satisfaction and thrill of building something of their very own.

THE CODE:MOBILE APPROACHOur youth programs: Girls Learning Code and Kids Learning Code are all about coding, technology and changing the world – through teamwork, creativity, and, of course, technology. The code:mobile will be offering 1.5 to 3 hour hands-on coding sessions that integrate web making and game making and all of the core components that our youth programs are known and loved for. Components like:  Our content has been designed specifically with girls in mind and creating gender-balanced tech environments.We keep in mind a recurrent theme in research on gender and technology: girls approach the computer as a “tool” useful primarily for what it can do; boys more often view the computer as a “toy” or an extension of the self. At Ladies Learning Code, we don’t only teach “how” to build, but also “why” it is important. We offer an opportunity for girls and boys to learn about technology and collaborate together.Fun and engaging contentWe LOVE technology and want to pass it on. With the help of developers, designers and professional educators, we’ve created content that not only showcases beginner-friendly concepts, but also ideas to be excited about.The opportunity to learn and collaborate alongside like-minded studentsThrough hands-on team-based exercises kids will feel a part of a resourceful group who are all curious about technology, and find learning about it both intriguing and rewarding.Tons of supportWith a high ratio of kids to expert mentors, questions are always encouraged, discussion is open-minded, and learning is creative and challenging.We’re all about confidence and empowermentOur lead instructors, mentors, and guest speakers are ready to teach, motivate and inspire. These are people who are currently in the field of technology, in a professional role, or in a learning opportunity.We’re all about supporting the communities we visit to keep learning We want to ensure that every kid, parent and teacher that attends one of the code:mobile sessions has the support and resources to continue learning. As such, we’re creating a resource package of content and teaching materials to leave with each community and an opportunity for anyone to start their own code:club in their home, school or community centre with our support. WHAT’S LADIES LEARNING CODE DONE SO FAR?
Founded in 2011, we are a Canadian not-for-profit organization with the mission to become the leading resource for women and youth to become passionate builders - not just consumers - of technology by learning technical skills in a hands-on, social, and collaborative way. Our goal is to teach 200,000 Canadian women and youth to code by 2020.
We run one-day workshops for adults in 22+ cities (and counting) across Canada plus Girls Learning Code and Kids Learning Code, which are thriving youth programs for youth ages 6-17.
To date, we’ve taught over 24,000 women and youth in one of our programs across the country. It is exciting and heartening to know that Canadians of all backgrounds are getting a first taste of coding at our workshops, and leaving the event with a greater sense of self-confidence. That’s what digital literacy is all about! It’s this community that we can help grow and foster with your support. Learn more about our history and impact here.



STRETCH GOALS
$50,000

If we reach our funding goal of $50,000 we estimate we'll travel approximately 35,000km coast to coast, stopping in 40+ cities and teaching over 10,000 kids to code in the Summer of 2016. 
$75,000
If we raise $75,000 in funding, we'll have enough resources to keep the truck on the road for the Fall of 2016, too exposing another 5,000 kids to code. 
$100,000
If we raise $100,000 in funding, we'll have enough resources to extend our trip and/or do another cross-country tour in 2017 and/or get another truck and/or expand on our code:clubs curriculum. There’s a lot of possibilities here! 



I SEE MICROSOFT'S LOGO ON THE TRUCK. IF A MAJOR CORPORATION IS ALREADY SUPPORTING YOU, WHY SHOULD I HELP?
To date, we’ve been fortunate enough to have the support of many generous individuals and corporations like Microsoft, TELUS, Olson (who put together the awesome video) and more that have allowed us to purchase, retrofit the truck and put this campaign together. But to sustain this initiative, we need to engage teachers, parents and community members across the country.  All donations, regardless of the amount, help further our mission and allow us to reach more students.  Specifically, your financial contributions will help to get the code:mobile on the road and make the cross-Canada journey! Your support will help make our trip possible by contributing to costs associated with bringing on amazing team to deliver workshops across the country next Summer and by helping to cover operating costs like gas, parking, accommodations, insurance, CAA, regular maintenance checks and more. All of the important things that will keep the code:mobile trucking along. 



HELP US SPREAD THE WORD: JOIN THE CODE:SQUAD!
Ladies Learning Code has always been by the community, for the community. Our organization and programs are driven by learners, mentors, parents, teachers, sponsors, partners and volunteers who understand the importance of teaching and learning technical skills. Whether you donate to our campaign or not you can still help us reach our goal (and make history).  
How you can help:
Spread the word about the #LLCcodemobile on Facebook orTwitter.

Recruit a local group — girl guides club, school or community centre and request a visit from the code:mobile. 
Stay connected. Follow us on Facebook and on Twitter to stay up-to-date on our initiatives and programs and join our mailing list.





RISKS AND CHALLENGES

The team at Ladies Learning Code are social entrepreneurs and technologists that are super dedicated to making code:mobile and our cross-Canada journey happen. The real risks and challenges we face don't lie in completing this trip, but in the problems that we'll face without it.
Our backgrounds and passion for this cause make us the ideal team for this mission . If we raise our minimum funding goal, we do not anticipate any significant challenges or risks in completing our cross-Canada journey. 
As with all crowdfunding campaigns, there is always a risk of delay in delivering some of the rewards, but we've been careful to give ourselves more time than we think we'll need to make sure we get the rewards in a reasonable time.",9.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Quick Facts


1 billion people worldwide live with a disability.

People with disabilities in developing nations are disproportionately affected by poverty and excluded from all facets of society.

In developing countries there is an average of one physical therapist per 10,000 people.

Disability rights are human rights.

How We Help
Mobility
We provide appropriately fitted chairs to individuals in need and build the capacities of local partner organizations to ensure continued access and service.

<div>What we need is your support for those earthquake victims in the remote areas like Gorkha and Lamjung , where 7.8 rector scale earthquake had its epicentre. Dear donors, the entire village in Gorkha has been wiped out, whole  village with their livestock has been flattened to ground.

<div>Dear contributors with our money we may not be able to bring their dead ones back, bring their houses back but we can build a small huts for them to get some shelter.

<h4 style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">Here are a few typical ADHD traits that can be developed with understanding, perspective, and approach:</h4>
</div>
</div><div>
<h4><i>ADHD Super Powers </i></h4>
<p>1.<i>Risk Taking</i>: students with ADHD are intuitive thinkers and are more likely to act on opportunity and take business risks than miss an opportunity due to overanalyzing actions.</p>
<p>2.<i>Creativity</i>: “Thinking outside the box”— An abundance of thoughts and ideas come with the ADHD active mind. ADHD thinkers are creative problem solvers.</p>
<p>3.<i>Ability to Hyper Focus</i>: One way to think about ADHD is having a low boredom threshold—the ADHD brain becomes more easily frustrated with routine, and yet if they find something they love to do, students with ADHD can focus for hours on end. </p>
<p>4.<i>Multi-tasking</i>: The ADHD brain likes doing several tasks at one time. ADHDers are not necessarily better at multi-tasking than the general population; the difference is they love to multi-task. </p>
<p>5.<i>High Energy Level</i>: The ADHD brain thrives on stimulation – Entrepreneurs need the ability to manage chaos, unpredictability, and inconsistency. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Entrepreneurialism<b> and Dyslexia</b>
</h3>
<h4>People with dyslexia are likewise 2-3 times more likely to be Entrepreneurs compared to the general US and UK populations. <span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;""> Individuals with dyslexia proved more comfortable in a startup role because they have faced hard challenges from a very young age.</span>
</h4>
<h4><i>Delegation </i></h4>Entrepreneurs with dyslexia typically have more staff than non-dyslexic Entrepreneurs, are more likely to own more than one business, are able to grow their companies more quickly, and are more able to delegate.  Delegation is an example of the “coping strategies” folks with dyslexia employ to overcome their difficulties. <p></p>
<h4><i>Communication </i></h4>Having often struggled with written language, people with dyslexia often develop enhanced communication skills, which are an essential business tool when it comes to inspiring others to achieve a vision. <p></p>
<h4><i>Coaching</i></h4>
<div>These kids have often had teachers, parents, and counselors coaching them all their lives. It has been like havign a practive baord of directors. They know how to find mentors and use their resources of their communities.<br/>

THE GREENWOOD SCHOOL'S BREAKTHROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL TRAITS OF ADHD LEARNERS MEANS WE CAN HELP MORE KIDS THAN EVER. 
Entrepreneurialism and ADHD 
Creativity and Innovation are hallmarks of people with ADHD. From Richard Branson, to Charles Schwab, there are many powerful examples of successful Entrepreneurs who have ADHD. In fact, those who are diagnosed with ADHD are THREE TIMES more likely to be Entrepreneurs when compared to the general population. 

But without intervention kids with ADHD experience:


Problems succeeding at school
Problems at work, lost productivity, and reduced earning power
Problems with relationships
More driving citations and accidents
Problems with the law ( 40% of long term inmates are ADHD)

According to Dr. Joseph Biederman, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, ADHD may be one of the costliest medical conditions in the United States: “Evaluating, diagnosing and treating this condition may not only improve the quality of life, but could save billions of dollars every year""
With intervention these same kids can  grow-up to be wildly successful adults and now with The Greenwood School's breakthrough understanding of how to maximize the entrepreneurial traits these learners have we can help more kids than ever.

These kids have often had teachers, parents, and counselors coaching them all their lives. It has been like havign a practive baord of directors. They know how to find mentors and use their resources of their communities.


Entrepreneurialism and The Digital Age
To capitalize on this research (and frankly what we already know about our boys) we've created the first of its kind digital entrepreneurship program GREENWOOD ENTREPRENEURS aimed at transforming these unique skill sets into a successful marketplace of business and opportunity for these bright kids that society cannot afford to leave behind.
With speed and mobility the digital age has changed every major industry we know. The Greenwood Entrepreneur program gives our kids pragmatic, real-world  hands-on experience in building companies, solving problems, and selling themselves and their brand.

will be held from July 24-26 in New Jersey, for youth 15-21 years old. ECSS is a
 radical space for young people to examine local and global justice 
issues through a critical lens. </h3><p></p>
<h3>About ECSS</h3>
<p>ECSS (formerly 
DCDS) has been a community-funded project for 5 years and running!  With
 the banning of ethnic studies in many universities and public schools around
 the U.S., increased surveillance and policing of immigrant and people 
of color communities, and the recent global and local uprisings a part 
of the Occupy movement, it is important to support critical spaces of 
learning, questioning and base-building in our Desi communities.  Last 
year, 30 youth and adult allies from D.C., New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Massachusetts,
 Georgia, Louisiana, and Pennsylvania participated in our 3-day retreat 
to address issues of inequality, social justice and youth organizing 
through critical and Desi perspectives.</p>
<p>Desi refers
 to people whose ""origins"" are from Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, 
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, and the Maldives, but the diaspora
 spreads from Fiji to Trinidad, Kenya to the Persian Gulf, South Africa 
to Guyana, from Southall in Britain to Washington, DC and many places in
 between.  <br/><br/>ECSS is a FREE event and we want to keep it this 
way!  We need a little help to cover our primary costs : meals for young
 people, volunteers, and workshop coordinators and travel scholarships 
for youth outside of the NJ/NYC area.

<h3>
</h3><h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>100% of all funds raised go directly to ECSS project 
costs.  All organizers (which include youth alumni and adult allies) are
 volunteers, and housing and facilitator/guest honorariums are either 
non-funded or incur very small expenses.</p>
<p>This year our overall budget is approximately $4,500.  This includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>food (feeding up to 40 people, including healthy home cookin' from our kitchen)</li>
<li>transportation (including bus fare for out-of-state youth and speakers)</li>
<li>space rental (for 3 days)</li>
<li>$2500 for dorm residential space at Rutgers (for 2 nights) <br/>
</li>
<li>

East Coast Solidarity Summer (formerly known as DC Desi Summer) 
will be held from July 24-26 in New Jersey, for youth 15-21 years old. ECSS is a
 radical space for young people to examine local and global justice 
issues through a critical lens. 
About ECSS
ECSS (formerly 
DCDS) has been a community-funded project for 5 years and running!  With
 the banning of ethnic studies in many universities and public schools around
 the U.S., increased surveillance and policing of immigrant and people 
of color communities, and the recent global and local uprisings a part 
of the Occupy movement, it is important to support critical spaces of 
learning, questioning and base-building in our Desi communities.  Last 
year, 30 youth and adult allies from D.C., New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Massachusetts,
 Georgia, Louisiana, and Pennsylvania participated in our 3-day retreat 
to address issues of inequality, social justice and youth organizing 
through critical and Desi perspectives.
Desi refers
 to people whose ""origins"" are from Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, 
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, and the Maldives, but the diaspora
 spreads from Fiji to Trinidad, Kenya to the Persian Gulf, South Africa 
to Guyana, from Southall in Britain to Washington, DC and many places in
 between.  ECSS is a FREE event and we want to keep it this 
way!  We need a little help to cover our primary costs : meals for young
 people, volunteers, and workshop coordinators and travel scholarships 
for youth outside of the NJ/NYC area.  
What exactly happens at ECSS? Watch the videos from DCDS 2013, DCDS 2012, and DCDS 2010 to see what really goes down! 

What We Need
100% of all funds raised go directly to ECSS project 
costs.  All organizers (which include youth alumni and adult allies) are
 volunteers, and housing and facilitator/guest honorariums are either 
non-funded or incur very small expenses.
This year our overall budget is approximately $4,500.  This includes the following:

food (feeding up to 40 people, including healthy home cookin' from our kitchen)
transportation (including bus fare for out-of-state youth and speakers)
space rental (for 3 days)
$2500 for dorm residential space at Rutgers (for 2 nights) 


miscellaneous (the essentials like photocopies, folders, chart paper, and pens)

We share our adventures and our book and trauamteddy distributions with pictures on www.twitter.com/brehonadvisory 
We do this because every child needs
an opportunity to learn and to love to read. 
You can help us. 
You can knit traumateddies for us -
if you are time rich. 
You can donate money to fund more
books - if you are time poor. 
You can be our champion  -
follow us on social media if you too are learning to read and deal with
nighmares and just like children's books. You can help us print more books, and knit more teddies, and woolly jumpers (or sweaters, if you're American). You can start to learn the ABCs of Arabic here with a child-friendly video of Arabic ABCs.
For the grown ups: We at Brehon Advisory in partnership with Asala Publishers create, publish, distribute and educate with bilingual Arabic-English books that deal with the effects of trauma, dislocation and war for Syrian refugees and vulnerable host community children.   100% of donations received go to produce  the books and traumateddies. Here's what Education Journal Middle East says about us in their September 2015 issue: http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/launch.aspx?eid=41d0086d-925f-4a45-8468-932b9932d88b&pnum=38The technical stuff: The books are created by a team of PhD and ABD people (that means we love books so much we lived in a library for at least a decade). 

The books are written in Arabic first by a professor of child psychology. 


The books are shaped by talented Arab illustrators. 


The book are edited by English language professors and academic translators.


The books are the brain child of  a rogue professor of government in collaboration with a leading  children's book publisher. 


The books are distributed with an Arabic story teller wearing traditional dress. 


The traumateddies are knit by ladies across the UK and Ireland. 


The wool for the traumateddies is currently donated by an anonymous donor.

The woolly clothes, jumpers and sweaters, are created and delivered with love to the children we encounter where we see the greatest need.  (1,500 items to date).
What the teachers, schools and refugee volunteers tell us:
""We would be grateful for support with more books for teaching English to beginners and intermediate level."" Irbid, Jordan (Headmistress) 
“You delivered. The psychology students read the books to the children. It was very good. I am glad. Thank you.” Chatilla, Beirut Lebanon (Headmistress)
“We will put a copy of each book in the library so that all the students can read the stories at school as well as at home.” Headmaster International College, (Bedawi)
“We think this project is a success. Thank you once again for including us in it. Please do let us know when this activity will be repeated in future as we would love to stay part of it .Please bear us in mind in future.” Relief & Reconciliation ( Bekaa).
“It was our pleasure to have you at our centers in Beirut and in Bekaa, we appreciate your great job ...God Bless your efforts.” ""Great. Thanks so much for your continued support.""	 (Beirut Bekaa) Jusoor 
“There is a primary school in my hometown that would benefit from the books. Let's make it work” (UNICEF)

<p>Information Communication
Technology (ICT) is one of the fastest growing fields in Jamaica and women have

<p><b>Why an after-school program for rural girls?</b></p>
<p>Jamaican women and girls have
been largely left out of the growing ICT sector in Jamaica.  While there has been a program to improve

<p><b>How will your donations be used?</b></p>
<p>The goal is to raise funds needed

Help me help this amazing cause to continue changing lives in Urubamba!Thanks to each one of you,
Ania.About the foundation
We are Niños del Arco Iris, a foundation located in
the Valley of Urubamba, Cusco, Peru. Helena van Engelen (Netherlands) arrived to
Peru in the year 2001 to realize the sad reality of so many poor families in
rural areas of Cusco. There were too many children without any future, so she
decided to change that. The first thing she did was adopting seventeen homeless
children and provided them with nutrition, health, education, affection and a
home. From that moment, she knew that her goal in life was going to be helping
as many children as she could and give them the tools to achieve their dreams.
Helena sold her house in Holland to buy a 27,000 m2 piece of land in Urubamba
and throughout the years, more programs were implemented to the project, in
order to reach a greater scope for social development.
Fundacion Niños del Arco Iris provides education and health
care through the next social programs: 1. 
Niños del Arco Iris School: 
Its goal is to form real agents
of change for social development in Peru through education and values. 
· 
The children attend school from Monday to Friday
(8:00am – 4:30pm). 
· 
We have 140 deprived students from 1rst grade to
6th grade of primary. 
· 
They receive a healthy lunch at midday, that
helps them fight against anemia and malnutrition.
· 
 The
instilling of values is accomplished through everyday practice, including games
and environmental care. 
· 
From 2:00pm to 4:30pm we have extracurricular
activities and workshops such as computer classes, handcrafting, theatre,
typical dance classes and music classes. 
· 
Also, we provide medical and dental care.
2. 
CETPRO:
  Provides
technical education to deprived youth, so they can get into the labor market
with dignified jobs.  
· 
It offers two careers which are: Hospitality and
Services Management and Computing (I.T.). 
· 
Each career lasts two years, and they attend
classes from Monday to Friday from 8:00am to 1:00pm. 
· 
The foundation gets them internships in various
enterprises and hotels from the area and later, after graduation, they help
them find a job. 
· 
The instilling of values works on CETPRO in the
same way as in the school. 
3. 
Medical Center:
 
Accessible health care for the students’ families and other deprived
people from the area who need it. 
· 
We do 40,000 medical assistances each year.
· 
People can receive free medical or dental
assistance and they pay a minimum symbolic price just for medicines. Patients
who can’t even afford to pay the symbolic price are able to pay with their own agricultural

· 
These communities do not have any medical

Why do we need you?
We have donors in Peru and Holland but we are expanding our
boundaries to achieve new goals.  6th
grade has been implemented this year (new classroom and 25 more students). On
the other hand, we have new CETPRO students and the amount of patients in the
Medical Center is growing too. These means that our annual budget increased in
USD 20,000. This is a challenge for us but it also demonstrates good quality in

</div></div>","¿Por qué pedimos su apoyo? Las autoridades estatales y de la Universidad de Colima se han aliado para escamotear, desaparecer y desviar recursos que pertenecen a los trabajadores universitarios, recursos que son producto de años de esfuerzo:  A la fecha, las autoridades universitarias NO han cumplido sus compromisos ante los trabajadores.  El gobierno del estado, encabezado por Mario Anguiano, en contubernio con la Junta Local de Conciliación y Arbitraje, ha pisoteado los derechos, tanto contractuales como humanos, de los trabajadores universitarios, imponiendo junto con las corruptas autoridades universitarias a un líder sindical espurio y afín a sus intenciones perversas de desviar recursos.  Con su ayuda, podremos solventar los gastos legales que esta lucha contra la corrupción y el sindicalismo charro ha generado. 
   Cuánto y el por qué lo necesitamos:  Necesitamos 15 mil pesos mensuales ($15,000 MXN) , aproximadamente $800 dólares estadounidenses ($800 USD) exclusivamente para gastos legales. Por más que lo intentemos, nuestros esfuerzos personales no son suficientes. A la fecha, estamos atrasados por más de 6 meses en nuestras pagos por servicios legales.
Nos pusimos la meta de $50,000 USD por si acaso no logramos el objetivo, cualquier aportación suya será de gran ayuda para continuar nuestra lucha; por ello, ¡MUCHAS GRACIAS!     ¿Por qué aportar? Su ayuda le permitirá a miles de trabajadores universitarios afectados seguir la lucha por lo que justamente es suyo: recursos para su retiro digno.     Nuestros riesgos  La persecución de parte de las autoridades universitarias a los trabajadores ha sido constante, sabemos que corremos riesgos pero nonos importa, estamos hartos de la corrupción y la impunidad.

<b><u>Overview</u></b><br/>
Hi everyone! :) I have been given the incredible opportunity to
complete a 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training Program from October 2015 - February
2016.  I need to raise $2,800 to cover
the tuition costs to make my dream a reality! <br/><br/>
<b><u><span>Who
am I?</span></u></b> <br/>
My name is Emilie and I am 22 years old. I started practicing yoga shortly
after my brother Mike’s unexpected death on August 31, 2013. <br/>
<br/>
The Earth-shattering grief caused me to question everything about the world-
how could something like this ever happen? I felt like I was stuck in a dream I
couldn’t wake up from. Being without him couldn’t be the reality I was living.
Mike was not only my older brother, but my absolute favorite person in this
world- my best friend, and even a father figure as he was 8 years my senior. <br/>
<br/>
I turned to yoga to help me cope with the daily heartache. I first thought of
it through more of a fitness perspective- it would keep me busy and help me be
active, without being as intense as a P90x class, and the endorphin rush would
help naturally elevate my mood. However, the benefits have not only transformed
me physically (when I started, I couldn’t even touch my toes!) but have helped
change my mind and soul. <br/>
<br/>
What I’ve learned on the mat has translated to life off the mat. I have become

wonderful community of people with similar thoughts, stories, and backgrounds
and truly know compassion, acceptance and love. I know that without yoga I
wouldn’t have been able to make it through the loss of my brother- it helped me

my feelings. I was able to accept that everything does happen for a reason and that I have
the inner strength and outside support to get through whatever comes my way. <br/>

I want to complete yoga teacher training to not only deepen my practice, but to

injuries and increase flexibility and endurance, among many other things) but
also the mental and emotional benefits that come from dedicating time to yourself
on your mat, practicing mindfulness and gratitude, being still, and many other virtues
that are hard to truly learn in this crazy, unpredictable world we live in. <br/><br/>

Hi everyone! :) I have been given the incredible opportunity to
complete a 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training Program from October 2015 - February
2016.  I need to raise $2,800 to cover
the tuition costs to make my dream a reality! 
Who
am I? 
My name is Emilie and I am 22 years old. I started practicing yoga shortly
after my brother Mike’s unexpected death on August 31, 2013. 

The Earth-shattering grief caused me to question everything about the world-
how could something like this ever happen? I felt like I was stuck in a dream I
couldn’t wake up from. Being without him couldn’t be the reality I was living.
Mike was not only my older brother, but my absolute favorite person in this
world- my best friend, and even a father figure as he was 8 years my senior. 

I turned to yoga to help me cope with the daily heartache. I first thought of
it through more of a fitness perspective- it would keep me busy and help me be
active, without being as intense as a P90x class, and the endorphin rush would
help naturally elevate my mood. However, the benefits have not only transformed
me physically (when I started, I couldn’t even touch my toes!) but have helped
change my mind and soul. 

What I’ve learned on the mat has translated to life off the mat. I have become
much more patient, grateful, understanding, and kind. I was able to lean on a
wonderful community of people with similar thoughts, stories, and backgrounds
and truly know compassion, acceptance and love. I know that without yoga I
wouldn’t have been able to make it through the loss of my brother- it helped me
to truly know who I am, foster a healthy, nonjudgmental environment, and listen to
my feelings. I was able to accept that everything does happen for a reason and that I have
the inner strength and outside support to get through whatever comes my way. 

I want to complete yoga teacher training to not only deepen my practice, but to
help others come to the mat and find peace. I want to help others benefit from
not only the physical aspects of yoga (it has been known to improve chronic
injuries and increase flexibility and endurance, among many other things) but
also the mental and emotional benefits that come from dedicating time to yourself
on your mat, practicing mindfulness and gratitude, being still, and many other virtues
that are hard to truly learn in this crazy, unpredictable world we live in.

and our team collectively over 50 years. 
We have devoted our lives to the mission of preaching the word to
whoever is willing to listen. </span><br/></p>
<p>Over the last 5 years, my wife and I have been taught by God
revelations and biblical incites that are amazing and life changing.  The Lord has taught us personally so many revelations
and things that will impact the entire world in the next coming months and
years and very few are talking about it or even know about them.</p>
<p><b>We will be teaching and showing the world that the Bible
does gives us the clues to look for to give us the indication of when Jesus is coming back.</b> 
We will clearly show the world how Satan has used the statement that <i><b>“No
man knows the day and the hour” </b></i><b>(Matthew 24: 36-37)</b> to deceive the entire
Christian world.  This is a Parable from
Jesus to his Disciples and Satan has used it to keep the people who love the Lord and are committed
to following him, unprepared and not watching so they will become the <b>Unwise Virgins.
(Matthew 25: 1)</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>There is NOTHING more important that committed
Christians need to know at this time than this information!</b></p>
<p>The reason this message is so important to us is that the
entire purpose of all of us who are living a Christian life, is to, at some
point, be with Jesus and the Father in the Kingdom of God but everyone,
including myself, were deceived to think that no one knows when this day will
happen.  </p>
<p><b>We will show with proof from the bible that the bible and
Jesus shows his followers by revelation, exactly the signs
to look for.</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1348965/files/20150402060409-Blood-Moons-.png?1427979849"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>By the time we launch this campaign, within weeks the entire
world will know the signs to look for so we can be prepared and not deceived.  We will not give you the exact year, however,
the Lord says in his bible, that he will give us the signs to look for and we
can tell you, it’s a lot closer than you think, (A Lot Closer).  I know this may be a shock to you but you
will see it in your own bible.</p>
<p>The magnitude of this campaign is staggering and
worldwide.  It will impact the entire
world.  For the followers of Jesus, it is
what we have been waiting for our entire Christian walk, to become the Bride of
Christ.  For the non-believers, it will
be just like in the Days of Noah. <b>Matthew 24: 38-42</b></p>
<p>The Lord expects us who have been given the gift of knowledge and wisdom to teach it to His people and warn them of what is coming.  We are just obeying his command.</p>

<p>We need $68,000 to serve the poor and orphans and marketing materials to help us
spread the message worldwide.  There is tragedy going on around the world for Christians and we want to give them hope and a sense of peace in these last days.  We have seen some of the most devestating things with our own eyes and not filtered by the media of what is really going on around the world and we must do our part to help.  Just look at some of the pictures below and you can see that people are in a dire need of assistance just to live a normal life.</p>
<p>We will be using the funds to support different Christian Ministers and churches across the globe who are meeting the needs of the poor.  We are meeting ministers worldwide through our facebook group, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/themessiahiscoming/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/groups/themessiahiscoming/</a>   that have desperate situations in which they need financial support.  We will be providing them with sprirtual and financial assistance.</p>

We will be teaching and showing the world that the Bible
does gives us the clues to look for to give us the indication of when Jesus is coming back. 
We will clearly show the world how Satan has used the statement that “No
man knows the day and the hour” (Matthew 24: 36-37) to deceive the entire
Christian world.  This is a Parable from
Jesus to his Disciples and Satan has used it to keep the people who love the Lord and are committed
to following him, unprepared and not watching so they will become the Unwise Virgins.
(Matthew 25: 1)


There is NOTHING more important that committed
Christians need to know at this time than this information!
The reason this message is so important to us is that the
entire purpose of all of us who are living a Christian life, is to, at some
point, be with Jesus and the Father in the Kingdom of God but everyone,
including myself, were deceived to think that no one knows when this day will
happen.  
We will show with proof from the bible that the bible and
Jesus shows his followers by revelation, exactly the signs
to look for.


By the time we launch this campaign, within weeks the entire
world will know the signs to look for so we can be prepared and not deceived.  We will not give you the exact year, however,
the Lord says in his bible, that he will give us the signs to look for and we
can tell you, it’s a lot closer than you think, (A Lot Closer).  I know this may be a shock to you but you
will see it in your own bible.
The magnitude of this campaign is staggering and
worldwide.  It will impact the entire
world.  For the followers of Jesus, it is
what we have been waiting for our entire Christian walk, to become the Bride of
Christ.  For the non-believers, it will
be just like in the Days of Noah. Matthew 24: 38-42
The Lord expects us who have been given the gift of knowledge and wisdom to teach it to His people and warn them of what is coming.  We are just obeying his command.



The Lord put this message on our hearts and we will do
everything we can to get the Good News of the Kingdom of God preached in every
corner of the world.  
We pray you will support this mission.
God Bless You and Yours.

   What We Need & What You Get 
We need $68,000 to serve the poor and orphans and marketing materials to help us
spread the message worldwide.  There is tragedy going on around the world for Christians and we want to give them hope and a sense of peace in these last days.  We have seen some of the most devestating things with our own eyes and not filtered by the media of what is really going on around the world and we must do our part to help.  Just look at some of the pictures below and you can see that people are in a dire need of assistance just to live a normal life.
We will be using the funds to support different Christian Ministers and churches across the globe who are meeting the needs of the poor.  We are meeting ministers worldwide through our facebook group, https://www.facebook.com/groups/themessiahiscoming/   that have desperate situations in which they need financial support.  We will be providing them with sprirtual and financial assistance.


We will
use the money to meet the needs across the world and create the maximum exposure through several of the most
popular marketing venues:


Give financial aid to 30 + different churches who serve the poor

Send clothes and other items needed in the most needed areas

Assist with organizations that serve orphans in 3rd world countries
Develop and active video and  audio library of bible studies
Create printed bible studies for the people who don't have computers

Hosting live speaking events nationwideWith your donations and the Lord’s help, this mission will create a viral effect and the Lord’s message will be preached around the world by September 2015. The more money we raise, the more people we can reach.





Everyone who contributes will receive a copy of our E-book “Living the
Christian Life” Workbook.  Higher
contributions will receive different rewards such as copy of all of the
published videos on DVD, and recognition on our website.    The Impact 
With your help, we can shed light on a dark world about this
most important biblical truth the Lord wants us all to know about, The Day He
Is Coming Back.  The time is near and
Jesus is calling for his bride and does not want his true followers to suffer the wrath of God in the Great Tribulation which is coming on the earth.
Your donation will be the most significate donation you can
do for the people who hear the message and learn from it.  We can’t express the significance and the amount
of impact that your donation can make once this message hits the world but we
can say that Jesus said that once the message of the Kingdom of God is preached
around the world, He is coming to get his bride.  Matthew 24: 14We are the messenger, Jesus is the Message!
Your donation can make the world of difference!

to inspire young people to unleash their potential through experiential,
environmental education under sail.<strong> </strong> The <strong>vision </strong>i<em>s to empower generations of students to become
environmental stewards and transform their world through sailing. </em></p>
<p>Building a tall ship is part of our <b style=""font-weight: bold;"">greater goal of providing experiential learning experiences to youth</b>. Our partner Call of the Sea is currently serving 6,000 students per year on <i>Seaward</i>. <i>Matthew Turner</i> will allow 12,000 additional students per year to experience the powerful on-the-water programs where students experienced and learn seamanship, maritime history, marine ecology, teamwork, leadership and stewardship on day, overnight and ocean expeditions.</p><p></p><p>                                           </p><p>                                   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1363456/files/20150407134622-Confident_Boy_on_Halyard.jpg?1428439582"" src="""" style=""width: 318.09px; height: 256px;""/></p><blockquote>Students onboard Seaward learn teamwork as they raise the sails</blockquote><p>Our brigantine ship is

<p>Along with
specific lessons in seafaring history, navigation, seamanship, marine ecology
and science, students also gain teamwork, leadership and communication skills
as they take on responsibility for sailing the ship. The construction and
operating of a traditional tall ship will spark the inherent love of learning
that children of all ages possess, encourage them to see the rich ecological
environment and historical relevance of where they live, and to realize their
roles as stewards of their world. </p><p></p><p>                      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1363493/files/20150407135950-All_hands_on_deck.jpg?1428440390"" src="""" style=""width: 420px; height: 252px;""/></p><blockquote>Our Volunteers take a break from laying the frames for the deck. </blockquote>

His first vessel was the Nautilus in 1868, which out performed all other ship of the time and raised the bar in sailing ship design. While at the time, the East Coast was converting and producing mostly steam powered vessels, the Western States didn't have as easy access to coal and therefore continued to improve upon wind powered vessels. During his lifetime, Matthew Turner built 228 vessels which contributed to the success of many entrepreneurs of the time including some legacies that sill exist today including Matson Lines, Spreckles Sugar and C&amp;H sugar. </span></div><div><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></div><div><h3 style='color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 30px !important; letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Arial, sans-serif !important; font-size: 24px !important; font-weight: bold;'><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Who Are We?</b></h3></div><div>The vision behind building <i>Matthew Turner </i> was developed by Alan Olson with the dream to have a Tall Ship that can be used as the San Francisco Bay's own tall ship bringing children and adults alike to the water and create a connection to maritime history as well as to our natural world. The project got under way in late 2013 and has been steady for the past 18 months. Most recently Educational Tall Ship has merged with Call of the Sea (Executitve Director, Charlie Hart). Call of the Sea specializes in onboard educational programs for kids and adult aboard <i>Seaward</i>. This merger between the two organizations will allow more students to be reached in a more comprehensive way. Our office is staffed by few paid staff including Erika Dwyer, Program Director Call of the Sea and Meghan Hartnett, Development Associate <i>Matthew Turner. </i>Our 4 staff builders direct volunteers who work on building the ship. Our volunteer docents host school groups and work with teachers toe develop lesson plans.

If you are unable to donate funds and you would like to donate in other ways we accept donations in kind for materials (please contact our office for approval) and we also love volunteers to help build the ship. Please contact us and we can arrange for you to volunteer and get to work on building the ship. Please contact Meghan Hartnett, Development Coordinator at meghan@educationaltallship.org.
We would also love for you to share our effort amongst your friends and relatives. We have found that in addition to the desire to donate to our effort, many people are interested in our project for the sake of history or for the educational programs we provide. We would welcome interest from school groups as well who are interested in participating in our educational programs.


Who is Matthew Turner? 
Matthew Turner was a ship builder in the 1800's. He immigrated to the Bay Area from Lake Erie during the Gold Rush. After finding success and deciding to change focus to the production of ship building, to service the Gold Trade. His first vessel was the Nautilus in 1868, which out performed all other ship of the time and raised the bar in sailing ship design. While at the time, the East Coast was converting and producing mostly steam powered vessels, the Western States didn't have as easy access to coal and therefore continued to improve upon wind powered vessels. During his lifetime, Matthew Turner built 228 vessels which contributed to the success of many entrepreneurs of the time including some legacies that sill exist today including Matson Lines, Spreckles Sugar and C&H sugar. Who Are We?The vision behind building Matthew Turner  was developed by Alan Olson with the dream to have a Tall Ship that can be used as the San Francisco Bay's own tall ship bringing children and adults alike to the water and create a connection to maritime history as well as to our natural world. The project got under way in late 2013 and has been steady for the past 18 months. Most recently Educational Tall Ship has merged with Call of the Sea (Executitve Director, Charlie Hart). Call of the Sea specializes in onboard educational programs for kids and adult aboard Seaward. This merger between the two organizations will allow more students to be reached in a more comprehensive way. Our office is staffed by few paid staff including Erika Dwyer, Program Director Call of the Sea and Meghan Hartnett, Development Associate Matthew Turner. Our 4 staff builders direct volunteers who work on building the ship. Our volunteer docents host school groups and work with teachers toe develop lesson plans. Overall we are a fun group of people from all different walks of life, while we take our business seriously, we like to have fun and let loose. Come to one of our events and see our fun side, or volunteer on the ship build and sit and have a beer with us at the end of the day!

Hi there. We’re Sidekick Arts, a project developed by members of the Rogers Park Art Alliance in Chicago, IL.  


Our goal is simple: Connect working artists with partner schools to enhance classroom learning and school curriculum with presentations, demonstrations, and workshops.


But we need your help.

Hola. Somos ""Sidekick Arts"" (Compañero de Artes). Nuestro objetivo es simple: Conectar los artistas con los maestros para ayudar a expandir la educación artística para los estudiantes. Pero necesitamos tu ayuda.

Teachers and administrators know this, but their extremely busy schedules and tight budgets make it challenging to plan additional arts programming.

Los maestros y administradores saben esto, pero sus horarios son extremadamente ocupados y sus presupuestos ajustados hacen que sea difícil para planificar una programación de artes adicional.

That’s where you come in. See, we think the artists and the teachers are the heroes of this story, but every hero needs a good sidekick.

We are travellers,  explorers of both our outer and inner worlds. We see traveling as a tool to get in touch with other societies and as a chance to develop ourselves internally. In this way it is possible to become, even for a short time, part of that world, letting ourselves be shaped by the experience, by a new reality. </p><p>Our personal paths brought us here to Uganda for a volunteering experience, which is a powerful way to be deeply involved in the culture and the society. </p><br/><p>OVERVIEW OF OUR VOLUNTEERING</p><br/><p>Here in Mbale, a small city that survives mainly though the agricultural industry, we discovered a beautiful and unexpected reality, that deserves to be known, heard and helped.</p><p>The project that we are working for is to help and sustain local agricultural development. It has been surprising to find such a high degree of awareness in terms of organic, sustainable agriculture and the deeply ingrained respect for nature. A big contribution to this awareness has come from Slow Food, a non-profit international association which aims to give back value to food, respect the local procedures and the ecosystem, through the sharing and education of local knowledge and traditions. This means organic agriculture. This means respect of our earth and not exploit the soil - the land we live on. And this means respect for the producers. All of this really inspired us, and gave us hope for the future of not only Uganda, but Africa and the world.</p><br/><p>OUR PROJECT!!</p><br/><p>Our idea is to help a local farmer called Sam, whose farm is central to the ""Mugiti"" community - located just outside Mbale. This community counts about 2670 members spread in arround 700 households, all of them living through agriculture. They don't have electricity and have a very simple life. Their houses are built with self-made bricks with wooden roof covered with leafs. They take water from a well that has been donated by previous volunteers, and carries it with water cans to the respective areas. Sam utilises his farm as an important example and educational reference for the community and the development of his farming facilities has deeply impacted all of the families in the area.</p><p>This is not a conventional farm, focused on a business and a personal income, but a ""community farm"", a tool at the complete service of the social tissue that lives around it. Sam adheres to the <a href=""http://www.slowfood.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Slow Food</a> philosophy and he deserves assistance to further grow and guide his community, he is creating a better world and his farm could have the ability to act as an example for the greater community and the message will spread.</p><p>It is for this reason that we decided to start a crowdfunding project to help grow this community. We are conscious that as volunteers we are often just shooting stars - helping out for small periods of time but barely changing the world. That's why we had the idea of a creating a fund raising project. In this way we would be able to finance some of Sam's projects and the community, giving them the chance to start self-sustaining activities and enable them to take control of their futures. However the impact of this help would go far beyond the money raising - even if this is the main focus. This international help would provide more than a monetary value, it is giving them with the courage to keep going in this positive direction, knowing that they are not alone. We would be building a bridge between our countries and even though it is in a seemingly far away corner of our earth, it is our planet and our role to protect it.</p><br/><p>WHAT WILL THE FUND HELP US ACHIEVE?</p><br/><p>The projects that you can help make a reality are as follows (in order of priority):</p><br/><p>Tools (500 dollars)</p><p>The first expense that will be done is the purchase of necessary tools, not only for the projects that are to be started, but also for rutinary farm work. The amount of tools available is not enough as it is, and the constant use of these wears them, making it necessary to discard some or to spend money in repairing.</p><p>Allocating 500 dollars (aprox) will provide enough tools not only for the projects that are the aim of this campaign, but also for everyday use of the community.</p><p>Tools to be bought are mainly (but not limited to) :</p><br/><ul>
<li><p>Machetes</p></li>
<li><p>Water cans</p></li>
<li><p>Wheelbarrows</p></li>
<li><p>Hoes</p></li>
<li><p>Shovels</p></li>
</ul><br/><br/><p>Poultry Shelter (400 dollars)</p><br/><p>Benefits</p><br/><p>- Organic, self sustaining manure - utilising permaculture techniques, will be used throughout the farm and potentially as a viable means of income due to the high nutritional properties of chicken waste  </p><p>- Reduce death of young chickens - provide protection from predators and reduce the risk of death during the rainy season due to drowning</p><p>- Constant access to food through the use of troughs will promote faster, healthier growth</p><p>- Increase in reproduction efficiency and monitoring</p><p>- Source of food and income for the community</p><br/><br/><p>Bee Hive (100 dollars)</p><br/><p>Benefits</p><br/><p>- Promote a healthier environment through increased pollination which leads to empowering the fertility of the area as in the permaculture rules.</p><p>- Great means of income, of which can be reinvested into the community to develop other projects including the construction of a fishing farm</p><p>-  Medicinal purposes</p><p>- Sugar replacement - increase the self sustainability of the farm by reducing the need to source sugar from outside the community</p><p>- The low maintenance of the beehives will allow farmers to work on other products / harvesting…</p><br/><p>ABOUT DONATIONS</p><p>The idea is to donate an amount between the one suggested by us and linked to a Perk. However is possible to donate a free amount without receiving the Perk. To do this is enough to choose “No Perks, I just want to donate” at the moment of the donation, so to write the preferred amount without any Perk.</p><p>If you instead choose to receive the Perk you will be asked you address so to be shipped directly at your place.</p><p>Once chosen the amount/Perk you will be directed in the payment page, where you can choose between paypal or credit card.</p><br/><p>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP US!</p><p>We understand very well that not everybody can afford a donation.</p><p>No worries!! You can still help us out a lot!!</p><p>By spreading the message to everybody you know  if you think this project deserve it, and also using the social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Google+ ecc..</p><p>THANK YOUUUUUU!!!!!</p><br/><p>----------------------------------ITALIAN VERSION-----------------------------------------------</p><br/><p>CHI SIAMO?</p><br/><p>Siamo un gruppo di volontari di diverse nazionalità che si sono incontrati qui in Uganda a Mbale, cittadina a est non lontana dal Kenya, ognuno giunto qui dal proprio percorso ed esperienze di vita. Siamo viaggiatori, esploratori di mondi fuori e dentro di noi. Vediamo il viaggio come potente strumento per entrare in profondo contatto con altre società, culture e come un occasione per un profondo lavoro interiore. Vissuto in questo modo è possibile, seppur per un breve peridodo, diventare parter di quel mondo, fondersi e lasciarsi plasmare dall'esperienza, dalla nuova realtà. </p><p>I nostri percorsi personali ci hanno portato qui in Uganda per un esperienza di volontariato il quale è sempre un modo potente di farsi coinvolgere nella cultura e nella società. </p><br/><p>LA NOSTRA ESPERIENZA DI VOLONTARIATO</p><br/><p>Qui a Mbale, una piccola cittadina che vive principalmente attorno all'agricoltura locale, abbiamo scoperto una bellissima e inaspettata realtà, che merita di essere conosciuta, ascoltata e aiutata.</p><p>Il progetto per il quale stiamo lavorando è l'aiutare e dare supporto allo sviluppo dell'agricoltura locale. Ci ha stupito molto trovare qui un così alto grado di coscienza riguardo l'agricoltura biologica e sostenibile e un profondo rispetto per l'ecosistema. Un gran contributo per questa consapevolezza arriva dal movimento dello slow food, ""un associazione internazionale non-profit impegnata a ridare valore al cibo, nel rispetto di chi lo produce, in armonia con ambiente ed ecosistemi, grazie ai saperi di cui sono custodi territori e tradizioni locali"".</p><p>Ciò significa agricoltura biologica. Ciò significa rispetto per il pianeta e non sfruttamento incosciente del terreno, della terra su cui viviamo. E certamente significa rispetto per chi produce. Tutto questo ci ha davvero ispirato e dato grande speranza per il futuro, non solo di questo paese, ma dell'Africa e del mondo. </p><br/><p>IL NOSTRO PROGETTO!!</p><br/><p>Il nostro contributo in particolare va a Sam, un agricoltore locale, la quale fattoria è centrale della comunità ""Mugiti"" appena fuori dal centro di Mbale. Questa comunità conta circa 2670 membri distrubuiti in oltre 700 famiglie, che ruotano tutte attorno all'agricoltura. Non hanno corrente elettrica e vivono una vita semplicissima. Le loro case sono fatte di mattoni auto-prodotti e hanno tetti in legno coperti di foglie. Prendono l'acqua da un pozzo che è stato donato di recente da altri volontari e la trasportano alle loro case con delle taniche.</p><p>Qui Sam con la sua fattoria è un importante riferimento per tutta la comunità, e le sue strutture e progetti hanno forte impatto per tutte le famiglie della zona. Questa non è una fattoria convenzionale focalizzata sui profitti e il benessere di un singolo, ma bensì uno strumento al servizio della comunità che gli ruota attorno. Anche Sam aderisce ai concetti della <a href=""http://www.slowfood.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Slow Food</a> e merita d</p><p>avvero il nostro sostegno per guidare e sviluppare la sua comunità. Sta contribuendo ad un mondo migliore e la sua fattoria potrebbe diventare un buon esempio da seguire per membri di altre comunità.</p><p>Siamo tuttavia coscienti che noi come volontari siamo spesso come delle meteore, che passano per un breve periodo, partecipano ai progetti e danno una mano, ma non lasciano mai il segno contribuendo ad un cambio concreto. Abbiamo quindi pensato di organizzare una raccolta fondi per finanziare dei progetti che li possano mettere in condizioni di auto sufficienza. Qui va precisata una cosa molto importante. Una raccolta fondi per loro non significherebbe soltanto denaro per finanziare le iniziative, seppur sia il focus principale. Vorrebbe dire molto di più. Siginificherebbe dare visibilità a questa comunità, dare coraggio e una spinta verso la direzione virtuosa che hanno intrapreso facendo sapere loro che non solo soli ma hanno il supporto e l'ammirazione di molte persone. Questa iniziativa è alla fine un collegamento, un ponte che gettiamo tra i nostri paesi e questa realtà poco conosciuta ma meritevole, e che seppur distante da noi ha a che fare con la terra madre, col nostro pianeta e con l'impegno a rispettarlo e custodirlo.</p><br/><p>COME IMPIEGHEREMO I FONDI RICEVUTI?</p><br/><p>Il progetti che potremmo avviare con il vostro aiuto sono i seguenti (in ordine di priorità)</p><br/><p>Attrezzi e strumenti (500 dollari)</p><br/><p>I primi fondi verrebbero usati per l'acquisto di strumenti e attrezzi fondamentali, non solo per i progetti in fase di avvio, ma anche per i lavori di agricoltura quotidiani. Il numero attuale di attrezzature non è sufficiente e le poche presenti sono sottoposte ad un super lavoro rendendo necessarie riparazioni di fortuna e spese extra.</p><p>Partendo da 500 dollari potremmo rendere disponibili sufficienti strumenti per i progetti di cui si propone la campagna, come anche per l'uso quotidiano e futuro della comunità.</p><p>Gli attrezzi da acquistare sarebbero principalmente (ma non solo limitati a questi)</p><br/><ul>
<li><p>Maceti</p></li>
<li><p>Taniche d'acqua</p></li>
<li><p>Carriole</p></li>
<li><p>Zappe</p></li>
<li><p>Badili</p></li>
</ul><br/><br/><p>Pollaio (400 dollari)</p><br/><p>Benefici</p><br/><p>- Produzione di concime organico auto sostenibilie - usando tecniche della permacultura verrebbe usato per accelerare la produzione di hummus naturale - con la possibilità di produrre un entrata tramite la vendita di tale concime. </p><p>- Ridurre il tasso di morte di polli giovani, fornire protezione da potenziali predatori e ridurre il rischio di morte per annegamento durante la stagione delle piogge.</p><p>- Costante accesso al cibo grazie a mangiatoie promuoverebbe una crescita più rapida e sana </p><p>- Aumento delle riproduzioni e possibilità di monitoraggio delle stesse</p><p>- Fonte di cibo ed entrate economiche per la comunità</p><br/><p>Apicoltura (100 dollari)</p><br/><p>Benefici</p><br/><p>- Promuovere la salute dell'ambiente grazie all'aumentata impollinazione e come da permacultura un potenzialmento della fertilità dell'area.</p><p>- Ottima fonte di entrate, le quali verrebbero reinvestite dalla comunità per altri progetti tra i quali la costruzione di una ""fattoria di pesca""</p><p>-  Scopi medicinali</p><p>- Sostituzione dello zucchero - aumento della sostenibilità della fattoria riducendo la dipendenza dallo zucchero esterno alla comunità</p><p>- La poca necessità di lavoro e manutenzione permetterebbe ai fattori di dedicarsi ad altri prodotti e/o alla raccolta.</p><br/><p>PERKS/RICONOSCIMENTI</p><br/><p>Oltre a immaginare il gran beneficio che porterebbero le vostre donazioni abbiamo ovviamente anche dei pensierini pronti per voi!!</p><p>Questi sono i ""perks"" che vedete al lato in inglese, purtroppo li non c'è abbastanza spazio per tradurli in Italiano, li riportiamo quindi tradotti qui sotto:</p><br/><p>$5</p><p>Faraja (Incoraggiamento)</p><p>GRAZIE!!

VERSIÓN EN ESPAÑOL..................................................</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><span>Quienes somos?</span></p><br/><p>Somos un grupo de voluntarios que vienen desde todas partes del mundo a la ciudad del este de Uganda llamada Mbale, cada uno de nosotros en un camino distinto con experiencias de vida complementarias. Somos viajeros, exploradores del mundo. Vemos el viajar como una herramientas para ponernos en contacto con otras sociedades y como una oportunidad para desarrollarnos internamente. De esta forma es posible convertirse, por lo menos temporalmente, en parte del mundo, permitiendo que seamos marcados por la experiencia, por una nueva realidad.</p><br/><p>Nuestros caminos personales nos trajeron hasta Uganda para una oportunidad de voluntariado, la cual es una forma poderosa de estar profundamente involucrado en la cultura y la sociedad.</p><br/><br/><p>Resumen de nuestra experiencia</p><br/><p>Aquí en Mbale, una pequeña ciudad que sobrevive principalmente a través de la agricultura industrial, encontramos una bella e inesperada realidad que merece ser dada a conocer, ser escuchada y apoyada.</p><p>El proyecto para el cual trabajamos se basa en ayudar el desarrollo sostenible de la agricultura local. Ha sido sorprendente encontrar tan alto grado de conciencia en términos de agricultura orgánica y sostenible y el respeto por la naturaleza tan profundamente asimilado. Una gran contribución hacia esta conciencia viene de ¨Slow Food¨, una asociación internacional sin ánimo de lucro la cual busca devolver valor a la comida, respeto por los procedimientos locales y el ecosistema, compartiendo y educando respecto a las tradiciones y el conocimiento local. Esto es agricultura organica. Esto es respeto por la tierra y la no explotación del suelo en que vivimos.</p><p>Esto además significa respeto por los granjeros. Todo esto nos inspiró, y nos dio esperanza para el futuro no solo de Uganda, sino de África y el mundo.</p><br/><p>Nuestro proyecto!!</p><br/><p>La idea es ayudar a un granjero local llamado Sam, su granja es central para la comunidad ¨Mugiti¨ - ubicada justo afuera de Mbale. Esta comunidad cuenta con aproximadamente 700 hogares, todos viviendo a través de la agricultura. Ellos no cuentan con electricidad y tienen un estilo de vida muy simple. Sus casas son construidas con ladrillos manufacturados localmente, con techos en madera cubiertos con hojas. Ellos toman agua de pozos de agua donados previamente por otros voluntarios, y la llevan de vuelta a casa con contenedores. </p><p>La granja de Sam es utilizada como un importante ejemplo y referencia educacional para la comunidad, todos los desarrollos observados en esta granja han tenido un fuerte impacto en todas las familias del área.</p><p>Esta no es una granja convencional enfocada en los negocios y ganancias personales, es una ¨granja comunitaria¨, una herramienta para el servicio de las personas que viven alrededor.</p><p>Sam se adhiere a la filosofia de Slow Food, y merece apoyo para hacer crecer y guiar a su comunidad, él está creando un mundo mejor y su granja puede actuar como ejemplo para toda el área, permitiendo que el mensaje se difunda.</p><br/><p>Es por esta razón que decidimos empezar un proyecto de recaudación para ayudar a crecer la comunidad. Somos conscientes que como voluntarios a veces no tenemos el impacto deseado, ayudando por una pequeña cantidad de tiempo pero teniendo poco impacto a largo plazo. Al decidir crear una recaudación de fondos podremos ayudar a financiar los proyectos de Sam y a la comunidad en general, dándoles la capacidad de iniciar actividades sostenibles y a tomar control de su futuro. </p><p>Sin embargo, el impacto de esta ayuda lograría mucho más que la simple recaudación de fondos - aun teniendo en cuenta que este es el principal objetivo. Esta ayuda internacional provee más que un valor monetario, les está dando el coraje para continuar en esta positiva direccion, conociendo que no están solos. Estaríamos construyendo un puente entre nuestras naciones y a pesar de estar en esquinas opuestas de La Tierra, es nuestro planeta y nuestra responsabilidad es protegerlo.</p><br/><br/><br/><p>Qué lograremos con los fondos?</p><br/><p>Los proyectos que puedes ayudar a hacer realidad son los siguientes (en orden de prioridad):</p><br/><br/><br/><p>Compra de herramientas (500 dolares)</p><br/><p>El primer gasto que se hará es la compra de herramientas necesarias, no solo para los proyectos que están por empezar, sino tambien para trabajos rutinarios de granja. La cantidad de herramientas disponible no es suficiente en estos momentos, y el uso constante las desgasta, haciendo que sea necesario descartar algunas o gastar dinero en reparaciones.</p><p>Separando 500 dolares (aproximadamente) se proveerán suficientes herramientas no solo para los proyectos que busca impulsar esta campaña, sino para el uso diario de la comunidad.</p><p>Las herramientas que se compraran son: (pero no limitadas a)</p><br/><ul>
<li><p>Machetes</p></li>

<li><p>Incremento en la eficiencia de reproducción y de monitoreo.</p></li>
<li><p>Fuente de alimento y de dinero para la comunidad.</p></li>
</ul><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><p>Enjambre de abejas (100 dolares) 3 en total</p><br/><p>Beneficios:</p><br/><ul>
<li><p>Promover un medio ambiente más saludable a través de la polinización incrementada, lo cual lleva a mejorar la fertilidad del área, según las reglas de la permacultura.</p></li>
<li><p>Un excelente medio para generar dinero, el cual puede ser reinvertido en la comunidad para desarrollar otros proyectos, incluyendo la construcción de un estanque para peces.</p></li>
<li><p>Propositos medicinales.</p></li>
<li><p>Reemplazo para el azúcar, incremento en la autosostenibilidad de la granja al reducir la necesidad de obtener azúcar por fuera de la comunidad.</p></li>
<li><p>El bajo costo de mantenimiento de los enjambres de abeja permitirá a los granjeros trabajar en otros productos.</p></li>

We are travellers,  explorers of both our outer and inner worlds. We see traveling as a tool to get in touch with other societies and as a chance to develop ourselves internally. In this way it is possible to become, even for a short time, part of that world, letting ourselves be shaped by the experience, by a new reality. Our personal paths brought us here to Uganda for a volunteering experience, which is a powerful way to be deeply involved in the culture and the society. OVERVIEW OF OUR VOLUNTEERINGHere in Mbale, a small city that survives mainly though the agricultural industry, we discovered a beautiful and unexpected reality, that deserves to be known, heard and helped.The project that we are working for is to help and sustain local agricultural development. It has been surprising to find such a high degree of awareness in terms of organic, sustainable agriculture and the deeply ingrained respect for nature. A big contribution to this awareness has come from Slow Food, a non-profit international association which aims to give back value to food, respect the local procedures and the ecosystem, through the sharing and education of local knowledge and traditions. This means organic agriculture. This means respect of our earth and not exploit the soil - the land we live on. And this means respect for the producers. All of this really inspired us, and gave us hope for the future of not only Uganda, but Africa and the world.OUR PROJECT!!Our idea is to help a local farmer called Sam, whose farm is central to the ""Mugiti"" community - located just outside Mbale. This community counts about 2670 members spread in arround 700 households, all of them living through agriculture. They don't have electricity and have a very simple life. Their houses are built with self-made bricks with wooden roof covered with leafs. They take water from a well that has been donated by previous volunteers, and carries it with water cans to the respective areas. Sam utilises his farm as an important example and educational reference for the community and the development of his farming facilities has deeply impacted all of the families in the area.This is not a conventional farm, focused on a business and a personal income, but a ""community farm"", a tool at the complete service of the social tissue that lives around it. Sam adheres to the Slow Food philosophy and he deserves assistance to further grow and guide his community, he is creating a better world and his farm could have the ability to act as an example for the greater community and the message will spread.It is for this reason that we decided to start a crowdfunding project to help grow this community. We are conscious that as volunteers we are often just shooting stars - helping out for small periods of time but barely changing the world. That's why we had the idea of a creating a fund raising project. In this way we would be able to finance some of Sam's projects and the community, giving them the chance to start self-sustaining activities and enable them to take control of their futures. However the impact of this help would go far beyond the money raising - even if this is the main focus. This international help would provide more than a monetary value, it is giving them with the courage to keep going in this positive direction, knowing that they are not alone. We would be building a bridge between our countries and even though it is in a seemingly far away corner of our earth, it is our planet and our role to protect it.WHAT WILL THE FUND HELP US ACHIEVE?The projects that you can help make a reality are as follows (in order of priority):Tools (500 dollars)The first expense that will be done is the purchase of necessary tools, not only for the projects that are to be started, but also for rutinary farm work. The amount of tools available is not enough as it is, and the constant use of these wears them, making it necessary to discard some or to spend money in repairing.Allocating 500 dollars (aprox) will provide enough tools not only for the projects that are the aim of this campaign, but also for everyday use of the community.Tools to be bought are mainly (but not limited to) :
Machetes
Water cans
Wheelbarrows
Hoes
Shovels
Poultry Shelter (400 dollars)Benefits- Organic, self sustaining manure - utilising permaculture techniques, will be used throughout the farm and potentially as a viable means of income due to the high nutritional properties of chicken waste  - Reduce death of young chickens - provide protection from predators and reduce the risk of death during the rainy season due to drowning- Constant access to food through the use of troughs will promote faster, healthier growth- Increase in reproduction efficiency and monitoring- Source of food and income for the communityBee Hive (100 dollars)Benefits- Promote a healthier environment through increased pollination which leads to empowering the fertility of the area as in the permaculture rules.- Great means of income, of which can be reinvested into the community to develop other projects including the construction of a fishing farm-  Medicinal purposes- Sugar replacement - increase the self sustainability of the farm by reducing the need to source sugar from outside the community- The low maintenance of the beehives will allow farmers to work on other products / harvesting…ABOUT DONATIONSThe idea is to donate an amount between the one suggested by us and linked to a Perk. However is possible to donate a free amount without receiving the Perk. To do this is enough to choose “No Perks, I just want to donate” at the moment of the donation, so to write the preferred amount without any Perk.If you instead choose to receive the Perk you will be asked you address so to be shipped directly at your place.Once chosen the amount/Perk you will be directed in the payment page, where you can choose between paypal or credit card.OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP US!We understand very well that not everybody can afford a donation.No worries!! You can still help us out a lot!!By spreading the message to everybody you know  if you think this project deserve it, and also using the social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Google+ ecc..THANK YOUUUUUU!!!!!----------------------------------ITALIAN VERSION-----------------------------------------------CHI SIAMO?Siamo un gruppo di volontari di diverse nazionalità che si sono incontrati qui in Uganda a Mbale, cittadina a est non lontana dal Kenya, ognuno giunto qui dal proprio percorso ed esperienze di vita. Siamo viaggiatori, esploratori di mondi fuori e dentro di noi. Vediamo il viaggio come potente strumento per entrare in profondo contatto con altre società, culture e come un occasione per un profondo lavoro interiore. Vissuto in questo modo è possibile, seppur per un breve peridodo, diventare parter di quel mondo, fondersi e lasciarsi plasmare dall'esperienza, dalla nuova realtà. I nostri percorsi personali ci hanno portato qui in Uganda per un esperienza di volontariato il quale è sempre un modo potente di farsi coinvolgere nella cultura e nella società. LA NOSTRA ESPERIENZA DI VOLONTARIATOQui a Mbale, una piccola cittadina che vive principalmente attorno all'agricoltura locale, abbiamo scoperto una bellissima e inaspettata realtà, che merita di essere conosciuta, ascoltata e aiutata.Il progetto per il quale stiamo lavorando è l'aiutare e dare supporto allo sviluppo dell'agricoltura locale. Ci ha stupito molto trovare qui un così alto grado di coscienza riguardo l'agricoltura biologica e sostenibile e un profondo rispetto per l'ecosistema. Un gran contributo per questa consapevolezza arriva dal movimento dello slow food, ""un associazione internazionale non-profit impegnata a ridare valore al cibo, nel rispetto di chi lo produce, in armonia con ambiente ed ecosistemi, grazie ai saperi di cui sono custodi territori e tradizioni locali"".Ciò significa agricoltura biologica. Ciò significa rispetto per il pianeta e non sfruttamento incosciente del terreno, della terra su cui viviamo. E certamente significa rispetto per chi produce. Tutto questo ci ha davvero ispirato e dato grande speranza per il futuro, non solo di questo paese, ma dell'Africa e del mondo. IL NOSTRO PROGETTO!!Il nostro contributo in particolare va a Sam, un agricoltore locale, la quale fattoria è centrale della comunità ""Mugiti"" appena fuori dal centro di Mbale. Questa comunità conta circa 2670 membri distrubuiti in oltre 700 famiglie, che ruotano tutte attorno all'agricoltura. Non hanno corrente elettrica e vivono una vita semplicissima. Le loro case sono fatte di mattoni auto-prodotti e hanno tetti in legno coperti di foglie. Prendono l'acqua da un pozzo che è stato donato di recente da altri volontari e la trasportano alle loro case con delle taniche.Qui Sam con la sua fattoria è un importante riferimento per tutta la comunità, e le sue strutture e progetti hanno forte impatto per tutte le famiglie della zona. Questa non è una fattoria convenzionale focalizzata sui profitti e il benessere di un singolo, ma bensì uno strumento al servizio della comunità che gli ruota attorno. Anche Sam aderisce ai concetti della Slow Food e merita davvero il nostro sostegno per guidare e sviluppare la sua comunità. Sta contribuendo ad un mondo migliore e la sua fattoria potrebbe diventare un buon esempio da seguire per membri di altre comunità.Siamo tuttavia coscienti che noi come volontari siamo spesso come delle meteore, che passano per un breve periodo, partecipano ai progetti e danno una mano, ma non lasciano mai il segno contribuendo ad un cambio concreto. Abbiamo quindi pensato di organizzare una raccolta fondi per finanziare dei progetti che li possano mettere in condizioni di auto sufficienza. Qui va precisata una cosa molto importante. Una raccolta fondi per loro non significherebbe soltanto denaro per finanziare le iniziative, seppur sia il focus principale. Vorrebbe dire molto di più. Siginificherebbe dare visibilità a questa comunità, dare coraggio e una spinta verso la direzione virtuosa che hanno intrapreso facendo sapere loro che non solo soli ma hanno il supporto e l'ammirazione di molte persone. Questa iniziativa è alla fine un collegamento, un ponte che gettiamo tra i nostri paesi e questa realtà poco conosciuta ma meritevole, e che seppur distante da noi ha a che fare con la terra madre, col nostro pianeta e con l'impegno a rispettarlo e custodirlo.COME IMPIEGHEREMO I FONDI RICEVUTI?Il progetti che potremmo avviare con il vostro aiuto sono i seguenti (in ordine di priorità)Attrezzi e strumenti (500 dollari)I primi fondi verrebbero usati per l'acquisto di strumenti e attrezzi fondamentali, non solo per i progetti in fase di avvio, ma anche per i lavori di agricoltura quotidiani. Il numero attuale di attrezzature non è sufficiente e le poche presenti sono sottoposte ad un super lavoro rendendo necessarie riparazioni di fortuna e spese extra.Partendo da 500 dollari potremmo rendere disponibili sufficienti strumenti per i progetti di cui si propone la campagna, come anche per l'uso quotidiano e futuro della comunità.Gli attrezzi da acquistare sarebbero principalmente (ma non solo limitati a questi)
Maceti
Taniche d'acqua
Carriole
Zappe
Badili
Pollaio (400 dollari)Benefici- Produzione di concime organico auto sostenibilie - usando tecniche della permacultura verrebbe usato per accelerare la produzione di hummus naturale - con la possibilità di produrre un entrata tramite la vendita di tale concime. - Ridurre il tasso di morte di polli giovani, fornire protezione da potenziali predatori e ridurre il rischio di morte per annegamento durante la stagione delle piogge.- Costante accesso al cibo grazie a mangiatoie promuoverebbe una crescita più rapida e sana - Aumento delle riproduzioni e possibilità di monitoraggio delle stesse- Fonte di cibo ed entrate economiche per la comunitàApicoltura (100 dollari)Benefici- Promuovere la salute dell'ambiente grazie all'aumentata impollinazione e come da permacultura un potenzialmento della fertilità dell'area.- Ottima fonte di entrate, le quali verrebbero reinvestite dalla comunità per altri progetti tra i quali la costruzione di una ""fattoria di pesca""-  Scopi medicinali- Sostituzione dello zucchero - aumento della sostenibilità della fattoria riducendo la dipendenza dallo zucchero esterno alla comunità- La poca necessità di lavoro e manutenzione permetterebbe ai fattori di dedicarsi ad altri prodotti e/o alla raccolta.PERKS/RICONOSCIMENTIOltre a immaginare il gran beneficio che porterebbero le vostre donazioni abbiamo ovviamente anche dei pensierini pronti per voi!!Questi sono i ""perks"" che vedete al lato in inglese, purtroppo li non c'è abbastanza spazio per tradurli in Italiano, li riportiamo quindi tradotti qui sotto:$5Faraja (Incoraggiamento)GRAZIE!!

VERSIÓN EN ESPAÑOL..................................................Quienes somos?Somos un grupo de voluntarios que vienen desde todas partes del mundo a la ciudad del este de Uganda llamada Mbale, cada uno de nosotros en un camino distinto con experiencias de vida complementarias. Somos viajeros, exploradores del mundo. Vemos el viajar como una herramientas para ponernos en contacto con otras sociedades y como una oportunidad para desarrollarnos internamente. De esta forma es posible convertirse, por lo menos temporalmente, en parte del mundo, permitiendo que seamos marcados por la experiencia, por una nueva realidad.Nuestros caminos personales nos trajeron hasta Uganda para una oportunidad de voluntariado, la cual es una forma poderosa de estar profundamente involucrado en la cultura y la sociedad.Resumen de nuestra experienciaAquí en Mbale, una pequeña ciudad que sobrevive principalmente a través de la agricultura industrial, encontramos una bella e inesperada realidad que merece ser dada a conocer, ser escuchada y apoyada.El proyecto para el cual trabajamos se basa en ayudar el desarrollo sostenible de la agricultura local. Ha sido sorprendente encontrar tan alto grado de conciencia en términos de agricultura orgánica y sostenible y el respeto por la naturaleza tan profundamente asimilado. Una gran contribución hacia esta conciencia viene de ¨Slow Food¨, una asociación internacional sin ánimo de lucro la cual busca devolver valor a la comida, respeto por los procedimientos locales y el ecosistema, compartiendo y educando respecto a las tradiciones y el conocimiento local. Esto es agricultura organica. Esto es respeto por la tierra y la no explotación del suelo en que vivimos.Esto además significa respeto por los granjeros. Todo esto nos inspiró, y nos dio esperanza para el futuro no solo de Uganda, sino de África y el mundo.Nuestro proyecto!!La idea es ayudar a un granjero local llamado Sam, su granja es central para la comunidad ¨Mugiti¨ - ubicada justo afuera de Mbale. Esta comunidad cuenta con aproximadamente 700 hogares, todos viviendo a través de la agricultura. Ellos no cuentan con electricidad y tienen un estilo de vida muy simple. Sus casas son construidas con ladrillos manufacturados localmente, con techos en madera cubiertos con hojas. Ellos toman agua de pozos de agua donados previamente por otros voluntarios, y la llevan de vuelta a casa con contenedores. La granja de Sam es utilizada como un importante ejemplo y referencia educacional para la comunidad, todos los desarrollos observados en esta granja han tenido un fuerte impacto en todas las familias del área.Esta no es una granja convencional enfocada en los negocios y ganancias personales, es una ¨granja comunitaria¨, una herramienta para el servicio de las personas que viven alrededor.Sam se adhiere a la filosofia de Slow Food, y merece apoyo para hacer crecer y guiar a su comunidad, él está creando un mundo mejor y su granja puede actuar como ejemplo para toda el área, permitiendo que el mensaje se difunda.Es por esta razón que decidimos empezar un proyecto de recaudación para ayudar a crecer la comunidad. Somos conscientes que como voluntarios a veces no tenemos el impacto deseado, ayudando por una pequeña cantidad de tiempo pero teniendo poco impacto a largo plazo. Al decidir crear una recaudación de fondos podremos ayudar a financiar los proyectos de Sam y a la comunidad en general, dándoles la capacidad de iniciar actividades sostenibles y a tomar control de su futuro. Sin embargo, el impacto de esta ayuda lograría mucho más que la simple recaudación de fondos - aun teniendo en cuenta que este es el principal objetivo. Esta ayuda internacional provee más que un valor monetario, les está dando el coraje para continuar en esta positiva direccion, conociendo que no están solos. Estaríamos construyendo un puente entre nuestras naciones y a pesar de estar en esquinas opuestas de La Tierra, es nuestro planeta y nuestra responsabilidad es protegerlo.Qué lograremos con los fondos?Los proyectos que puedes ayudar a hacer realidad son los siguientes (en orden de prioridad):Compra de herramientas (500 dolares)El primer gasto que se hará es la compra de herramientas necesarias, no solo para los proyectos que están por empezar, sino tambien para trabajos rutinarios de granja. La cantidad de herramientas disponible no es suficiente en estos momentos, y el uso constante las desgasta, haciendo que sea necesario descartar algunas o gastar dinero en reparaciones.Separando 500 dolares (aproximadamente) se proveerán suficientes herramientas no solo para los proyectos que busca impulsar esta campaña, sino para el uso diario de la comunidad.Las herramientas que se compraran son: (pero no limitadas a)
Machetes
Recipientes de agua
Carretillas
Picas
Palas
Gallinero (400 dolares), 3 en totalBeneficios:
Estiércol orgánico y auto sostenible - utilizando técnicas de permacultura, este sera usado a travez de la granja y potencialmente será viable como un medio para generar dinero, esto debido a las altas propiedades nutricionales de los desechos de gallina.
Reducir el número de muertes de gallinas jóvenes, al proveer protección contra depredadores y al reducir el riesgo de muerte durante temporada de lluvias, debido a ahogamiento.
Accesso costante a comida por medio del uso de recipientes alimentadores, esto promoverá un crecimiento más rápido y saludable.
Incremento en la eficiencia de reproducción y de monitoreo.
Fuente de alimento y de dinero para la comunidad.
Enjambre de abejas (100 dolares) 3 en totalBeneficios:
Promover un medio ambiente más saludable a través de la polinización incrementada, lo cual lleva a mejorar la fertilidad del área, según las reglas de la permacultura.
Un excelente medio para generar dinero, el cual puede ser reinvertido en la comunidad para desarrollar otros proyectos, incluyendo la construcción de un estanque para peces.
Propositos medicinales.
Reemplazo para el azúcar, incremento en la autosostenibilidad de la granja al reducir la necesidad de obtener azúcar por fuera de la comunidad.
El bajo costo de mantenimiento de los enjambres de abeja permitirá a los granjeros trabajar en otros productos.
Acerca de las donacionesLa idea es donar un valor según los valores sugeridos conectados con un regalo. Sin embargo es posible donar un valor libre sin recibir el regalo. Para hacer esto solo debes seleccionar la opción ¨sin regalo, solo quiero donar¨ al momento de completar la donación, para escoger entonces el valor preferido sin recibir regalo.Si en vez de eso prefieres recibir el regalo, se te pedirá tu direccion para poder enviar el regalo directamente a tu hogar.Una vez escojas el valor, se te llevará a la pagina de pago, donde puedes escoger entre paypal o tarjeta de crédito.Donaciones:(tasa de conversión de Octubre 9 - 2015)Faraja (estimulo) $5 dolares - $ 14.470 pesos colombianosGracias!

<br/>
<span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">My name is Christopher LeBlanc. I am a 19 year old aspiring actor based in Ottawa, Canada. I have a dream of becoming a successful, working actor. I have been pursuing this dream for the past 3 years now. It all started when I was in the eighth grade, and a teacher of mine at the time told me that I had a talent for acting. She was my drama teacher, and she saw potential in me. At the time, I didn't want to act, I just wanted to be in the class and have fun. She even offered to write me a letter of recommendation for Canterbury high school (which was the high school of artistically talented students). I naively rejected, because I wanted to go to a school that all my friends were going to, and where I thought it would be easier for me to have a social life. In high school, that teacher and her suggestion ran through my mind every day. I often wondered had I made the right decision, maybe she was right and knew me better than I knew myself. I took drama every year in high school because of that teacher. I thoroughly enjoyed drama class, it was a place where I experienced freedom and really the only class that I was 110% engaged in. I didn't know what it was about the class, I just loved it. I got really involved with sports teams, I didn't have a favourite sport so I tried out for all the major sports (i.e Basketball, Football, Track &amp; Field and Rugby). I liked playing the sports but I thoroughly enjoyed and loved the performance part of the game. I loved being seen by all the parents and fans. I loved the entertainment that we were providing for the audience. That's where my heart was, it was in the performance. So, I stayed involved in the sports and drama class. When I was 16, I decided that I was going to become an actor because I loved performing and I wanted to live a life that I loved and that I could be happy in. So, I got an agent and began auditioning for roles. I auditioned for many things, and was fortunate enough to land a few small print ads, for LCBO, Maynards and Slidestand. I was in a play in my senior year of high school, and a buddy of mine and I won a Cappie award for best ensemble in a play for out performance.  I auditioned for the last 3 years and paid for acting workshops before paying for a private acting coach, whom I've benefitted a great deal from working with. A friend of mine suggested that I should contact an agency in Toronto. I did and when I got there, the agent I met with said that I had a great deal of potential and he would like for me to be a part of his roster, but he would love it if I went the American Academy of Dramatic Arts to train first. I told him I couldn't afford it, my family couldn't afford it, there was no way I could go to that school. He told me then, that I should start with a smaller agency, because he only works with established actors. I tried to convince him to take a chance on me, but business is business and he needs me to go to the school or nothing can happen. I went home, a little bummed but not the slightest bit discouraged. I looked up the Academy on the web, and it seemed like an incredible opportunity for any aspiring actor to have that kind of foundation in their performance. It gave them a </span><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;"">competitive</span><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;""> edge that was incomparable to what any private acting coach could offer. I thought it was worth a shot, to at least apply for it.  So, I applied for the school and sent in all the </span><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;"">necessary</span><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;""> documentation (i.e transcript, letters of recommendation, etc.). Everything was good, so I had an audition set up for the Academy. My audition went so well, that I got accepted earlier than I thought and I was offered a $12 thousand dollar scholarship to go to the academy. I have money saved up, however, it is not enough to cover tuition as well as the cost of living in LA. </span></span><br/>
</h3> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<p>What I need is $15 thousand USD to pay for the cost of living there. As well as to add on to the money I have saved and am taking from the bank in order to pay for the tuition. I will become successful, because I believe that I am the one. I will become successful, because I am confident, motivated and tenacious. I will out work all my fellow students at the academy, because I need this more than they do. I want to prove to myself and everyone else that you can achieve your dream, that you can do whatever it is that you want to do. I will achieve my goal because I want to motivate others to do the same. I want to inspire greatness in other people. I want to go into high schools and middle schools after my success and show them that if I can do it, you can do it too. You just have to believe and make the effort. It's not easy trying to be successful. But, I think it would be harder to be laying on my death bed and standing around me are the ghosts of the ideas and dreams that were given to me, saying why didn't you try. Why did you let your family talk you out of it. Why didn't you try to find the money for the academy other ways. Why did you give up? Why didn't you try to be all that you can be? That my friends will be much harder to deal with than anything that could be thrown my way on my journey to success. I will become successful, because I want to inspire the world with my success to achieve their own goals and dreams. When you're chasing your dream there is fire that burns inside you that makes you find the joy in life. It puts a smile on your face because everyday when you wake up and go after your dream, you just get this overwhelming sensation that life is beautiful and you're so excited to just be alive. I want to bring that joy of life to the earth, I want to bring happiness into peoples lives, I want to connect with people and I believe the best way to do that is through accomplishing my goals and dreams. I need your help to do this, I need that money to pay for school. I swear to you that it will not be for nothing. The money is going towards my education. I will be the next big thing, because my ""why"" is you. All of you! I'm doing this to better all our lives, and with that weighing on my shoulders, there is no chance that I'll give up. Anything is possible with motivation, confidence and tenacity. We will impact the world, because you believe in me, and I only want to serve the world with my talent.<br/><br/>I don't believe that there is any risk here. I ran the 400m sprint, when I competed in track and field. I learned a valuable lesson when I was training and competing. The lesson was that if you really want to become better at something, running faster in the 400m for instance, you just have to remember that you want that and every time that you train, you train your hardest. I dropped from 58seconds in the 400m to 50 secs in just 5 months.  I didn't want to always lose, so my technique got better, I developed efficiency in running, through focus and motivation. I say I don't believe there is any risk here, because I honestly will train at the academy the same way that I trained for the 400m, harder even, because this is my passion.

</div></div>","My name is Christopher LeBlanc. I am a 19 year old aspiring actor based in Ottawa, Canada. I have a dream of becoming a successful, working actor. I have been pursuing this dream for the past 3 years now. It all started when I was in the eighth grade, and a teacher of mine at the time told me that I had a talent for acting. She was my drama teacher, and she saw potential in me. At the time, I didn't want to act, I just wanted to be in the class and have fun. She even offered to write me a letter of recommendation for Canterbury high school (which was the high school of artistically talented students). I naively rejected, because I wanted to go to a school that all my friends were going to, and where I thought it would be easier for me to have a social life. In high school, that teacher and her suggestion ran through my mind every day. I often wondered had I made the right decision, maybe she was right and knew me better than I knew myself. I took drama every year in high school because of that teacher. I thoroughly enjoyed drama class, it was a place where I experienced freedom and really the only class that I was 110% engaged in. I didn't know what it was about the class, I just loved it. I got really involved with sports teams, I didn't have a favourite sport so I tried out for all the major sports (i.e Basketball, Football, Track & Field and Rugby). I liked playing the sports but I thoroughly enjoyed and loved the performance part of the game. I loved being seen by all the parents and fans. I loved the entertainment that we were providing for the audience. That's where my heart was, it was in the performance. So, I stayed involved in the sports and drama class. When I was 16, I decided that I was going to become an actor because I loved performing and I wanted to live a life that I loved and that I could be happy in. So, I got an agent and began auditioning for roles. I auditioned for many things, and was fortunate enough to land a few small print ads, for LCBO, Maynards and Slidestand. I was in a play in my senior year of high school, and a buddy of mine and I won a Cappie award for best ensemble in a play for out performance.  I auditioned for the last 3 years and paid for acting workshops before paying for a private acting coach, whom I've benefitted a great deal from working with. A friend of mine suggested that I should contact an agency in Toronto. I did and when I got there, the agent I met with said that I had a great deal of potential and he would like for me to be a part of his roster, but he would love it if I went the American Academy of Dramatic Arts to train first. I told him I couldn't afford it, my family couldn't afford it, there was no way I could go to that school. He told me then, that I should start with a smaller agency, because he only works with established actors. I tried to convince him to take a chance on me, but business is business and he needs me to go to the school or nothing can happen. I went home, a little bummed but not the slightest bit discouraged. I looked up the Academy on the web, and it seemed like an incredible opportunity for any aspiring actor to have that kind of foundation in their performance. It gave them a competitive edge that was incomparable to what any private acting coach could offer. I thought it was worth a shot, to at least apply for it.  So, I applied for the school and sent in all the necessary documentation (i.e transcript, letters of recommendation, etc.). Everything was good, so I had an audition set up for the Academy. My audition went so well, that I got accepted earlier than I thought and I was offered a $12 thousand dollar scholarship to go to the academy. I have money saved up, however, it is not enough to cover tuition as well as the cost of living in LA. 
   
What I need is $15 thousand USD to pay for the cost of living there. As well as to add on to the money I have saved and am taking from the bank in order to pay for the tuition. I will become successful, because I believe that I am the one. I will become successful, because I am confident, motivated and tenacious. I will out work all my fellow students at the academy, because I need this more than they do. I want to prove to myself and everyone else that you can achieve your dream, that you can do whatever it is that you want to do. I will achieve my goal because I want to motivate others to do the same. I want to inspire greatness in other people. I want to go into high schools and middle schools after my success and show them that if I can do it, you can do it too. You just have to believe and make the effort. It's not easy trying to be successful. But, I think it would be harder to be laying on my death bed and standing around me are the ghosts of the ideas and dreams that were given to me, saying why didn't you try. Why did you let your family talk you out of it. Why didn't you try to find the money for the academy other ways. Why did you give up? Why didn't you try to be all that you can be? That my friends will be much harder to deal with than anything that could be thrown my way on my journey to success. I will become successful, because I want to inspire the world with my success to achieve their own goals and dreams. When you're chasing your dream there is fire that burns inside you that makes you find the joy in life. It puts a smile on your face because everyday when you wake up and go after your dream, you just get this overwhelming sensation that life is beautiful and you're so excited to just be alive. I want to bring that joy of life to the earth, I want to bring happiness into peoples lives, I want to connect with people and I believe the best way to do that is through accomplishing my goals and dreams. I need your help to do this, I need that money to pay for school. I swear to you that it will not be for nothing. The money is going towards my education. I will be the next big thing, because my ""why"" is you. All of you! I'm doing this to better all our lives, and with that weighing on my shoulders, there is no chance that I'll give up. Anything is possible with motivation, confidence and tenacity. We will impact the world, because you believe in me, and I only want to serve the world with my talent.I don't believe that there is any risk here. I ran the 400m sprint, when I competed in track and field. I learned a valuable lesson when I was training and competing. The lesson was that if you really want to become better at something, running faster in the 400m for instance, you just have to remember that you want that and every time that you train, you train your hardest. I dropped from 58seconds in the 400m to 50 secs in just 5 months.  I didn't want to always lose, so my technique got better, I developed efficiency in running, through focus and motivation. I say I don't believe there is any risk here, because I honestly will train at the academy the same way that I trained for the 400m, harder even, because this is my passion. This is what I want to do with the rest of my life. I don't care how long it takes or how much it cost, I have to do this, no matter what happens. It's my time, I was born for a purpose and that purpose is to achieve my goal and then motivate everyone else do achieve theirs. Imagine what the world would be life if everyone lived their dream.

<p>I am Addis
and I recently got accepted at the <a href=""http://www.frankfurt-school.de/content/en.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Frankfurt School of Finance and Management</a> to pursue a two years <a href=""http://www.frankfurt-school.de/content/en/education_programmes/master/mib.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Master in International Business</a> with a regional specialization
on Africa. Frankfurt School offered me a scholarship of 20.000 Euro to cover
80% of the tuition fee with the condition that I pay the remaining 20%, plus
cover my living expenses. I am able to meet the first condition, but so far
it’s impossible for me to cover my living expenses. Based on German
regulations, a foreign student must have at least 8000€ which should cover all
costs for one year. </p>
<p>Despite my
financial difficulties I refuse to quit on my ambition. I want to do my MIB at Frankfurt School in order to contribute to my
continent’s development. The regional specialization during my studies will
enable me to understand business and economic aspects within Africa and to
apply my knowledge accordingly. This is why I decided to address a broader
audience with a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo in order to acquire the necessary
funds.</p><p><b>My Goal: <b>A Democratic Scholarship That</b> Provides Opportunities For Others</b><br/></p>
<p>This
campaign is not just about me. I believe it’s time to change the rules of the
game and create a “scholarship” opportunity in the most democratic way
possible: Raising funds for education through a crowdfunding campaign enables
each side, funders and future potentials to contribute to future change by
their respective means. In order to create change we need to help young
potentials to overcome the obstacles that have nothing to do with their
abilities, but the fact on which continent they were born.</p>
<p>In the near
future <span>I therefore want to provide</span> a platform, <strong>“<a href=""http://fundmystudies.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>fundmystudies</span></a></strong><strong>”,
</strong>to young people who face similar challenges so that they can
find the necessary support to tell their story to the international

<p><b>I. Do I need
a PayPal account to make a contribution?</b> </p>
<p><b>No.</b> All you

<p><b>II. Why is
the funding goal 9120€ when I need only around 8000€ to cover my living
expenses?</b></p>
<p>The funding
goal of 9120€ is calculated on the basis of the required amount of 8000€ plus
the fees charged by Indiegogo (4-9%) and the transaction fees that apply after
the completion of the campaign (3-5%).</p>
<p><b>III. What
will happen with the raised money if I do not reach the funding goal?</b> </p>
<p>Based on the
principles of ""Flexible Funding"" I will receive the raised funds
regardless of the campaign's success. I decided for ""Flexible
Funding"" because I will of course try to find ways to raise the lacking
amount in case I will not reach the funding goal fully. However, should I not
be able to start my studies in Frankfurt this autumn, I will return the money
to the contributors. 

</p><p><b><span>IV. How can

account of the campaign’s team member, <a href=""http://fundmystudies.org/about-us-2/team/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Eva Hanau</a>. In case I am successful and have the sufficient amount to apply
for a student visa, the money will be transferred to a ""blocked

use in order to be granted a student visa to Germany. The account allows me to
withdraw 670€ monthly. </p><b>V. 8000€ is a lot of money. Why can’t I just do a similar Master in Ethiopia? </b><br/><br/>I don’t think that I am an exception when I

of Germany’s leading business schools with a strong international focus.
Comparable programmes are not available in Ethiopia, nor will any Master
programme in Ethiopia enable me to have the exposure to an international

studying abroad. Therefore I am sure that this money is well-invested.<p><br/></p><div></div></div>","Zur deutschen ÜbersetzungAbout MeSelam!

<p><b>THE KIDS ARE ALL WRIGHT</b></p> <p>Help bring this Docuseries to television or other media outlets and share the Wright's story with the world!   The show has a veteran production company behind it with 20 years in Hollywood and credits like The Little Couple &amp; Modern Marvels. The Kids Are All Wright is currently under review at several networks - we need to create a buzz and prove there is an audience for Down Syndrome. </p>

<p>Teen sisters Lillie &amp; Emma Grace are remarkable on so many levels - their story is poignant with a future that seems to have already been written. They love their Siblings with Down Syndrome so much that they both feel having children of their own with Downs one day would be great - they claim they'd even adopt a baby or two with Downs one day!  15 &amp; 16 year old girls have enough to think about between school, hair, clothes, and boys - throw a 5 and 10 year old brother &amp; sister with Downs in the mix and things can quickly fly out of control! One sister values her quiet time and the other feels an obligation to help with a 10 year old's diapers. The contrast creates chaos and sisterly love can sometimes be stressed into a hard slap. Watch how this family overcomes the odds on a daily basis and manages the bumps and bruises along the way.</p>
<ul> <li>The production company: KMG has over 20 years in Hollywood  <a href=""kmgroupla.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(kmgroupla.com)</a> working on shows like The Little Couple, Modern Marvels, Rock of Love and the Surreal Life. KMG is working pro bono to bring The Kids Are All Wright to the world and show how life with Down Syndrome is challenging, rewarding and also wonderful! KMG has already committed over $700,000 of their own funds to help finance the first 3 episodes of the series.</li> <li>Your support will bring this show to media and broadcast outlets so that it may not only entertain, educate and endear you, the audience, but also serve as a guide to those who need to learn more about Down Syndrome. We hope you will help - even a dollar makes a difference!</li>

THE KIDS ARE ALL WRIGHT Help bring this Docuseries to television or other media outlets and share the Wright's story with the world!   The show has a veteran production company behind it with 20 years in Hollywood and credits like The Little Couple & Modern Marvels. The Kids Are All Wright is currently under review at several networks - we need to create a buzz and prove there is an audience for Down Syndrome. 
Watch the promo Supertease for this series here 

Teen sisters Lillie & Emma Grace are remarkable on so many levels - their story is poignant with a future that seems to have already been written. They love their Siblings with Down Syndrome so much that they both feel having children of their own with Downs one day would be great - they claim they'd even adopt a baby or two with Downs one day!  15 & 16 year old girls have enough to think about between school, hair, clothes, and boys - throw a 5 and 10 year old brother & sister with Downs in the mix and things can quickly fly out of control! One sister values her quiet time and the other feels an obligation to help with a 10 year old's diapers. The contrast creates chaos and sisterly love can sometimes be stressed into a hard slap. Watch how this family overcomes the odds on a daily basis and manages the bumps and bruises along the way.
 The production company: KMG has over 20 years in Hollywood  (kmgroupla.com) working on shows like The Little Couple, Modern Marvels, Rock of Love and the Surreal Life. KMG is working pro bono to bring The Kids Are All Wright to the world and show how life with Down Syndrome is challenging, rewarding and also wonderful! KMG has already committed over $700,000 of their own funds to help finance the first 3 episodes of the series. Your support will bring this show to media and broadcast outlets so that it may not only entertain, educate and endear you, the audience, but also serve as a guide to those who need to learn more about Down Syndrome. We hope you will help - even a dollar makes a difference!
   Give a little - Get A LOT!

<h3>Special Surfer Night</h3>
<div>
<p>
</p>
<p>Special Surfer Night is a free program for children and young adults with physical, mental or emotional disabilities. We
currently offer eligibility for 100 Special Surfers for each of the three summer nights we offer the program. We recruit hundreds of volunteers. We provide wetsuits, boards and adaptive equipment.  These
Special Surfers often are unable to participate in many sporting activities due
to mental or physical limitations. When they come surf with us, they are
unlimited in the physical sense, since the ocean and board (and volunteers) do
all the physical and mental work. </p>

<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What we need</h3>
<div>Aquaholics Surf Shop has been funding this program since 2004. With 100 kids on the roster, it has grown into something the shop can no longer fund. Now that we have established 501C3 Non-Profit status, we're asking for more help. We need boards, wetsuits, adaptive equipment, insurance, storage/transport trailer, web services, legal services &amp; staff. We have truly outgrown our little program. </div>
<div>
<p>We plan to buy 96 boards (we have a few from previous donors THANKS AGAIN!), 200 wetsuits (so many sizes need to be in multiples, and we need overlap), 6 adaptive chairs and tumble forms, harnesses, and straps, a trailer or van for storage and transport, incidentals like wetsuit shampoo, rinse buckets, signage, color coded tee shirts,  paper for forms, promo supplies, insurance, legal help and staffing. We've been at this for 11 years, we've got it wired! The budget for this is more than $55,000, (a lot more,) but we'll be happy to get what we can! </p>
<p>Here's what the budget looks like, for the event in it's entirety, we're hoping to raise all of the funds needed by surpassing our goal, but the indiegogo data suggests it's better to start small and GO BIG, so we're asking you to help us get a jump on the order by at least covering equipment costs. In case you're grabbing your calculator, this comes to $109,541. </p>

<div>
<div>This program is and has always been free. Often people suggest that we charge for this program. Not a chance. These kids and their families live everyday carrying a heavy load. Social, physical, mental. They have expenses we can't comprehend. This is our way of giving them an easy, free, no hassle mini vacation from the daily pressures of raising or caring for a kid or young adult (or being one) who constantly redefines what unconditional love requires. Pick a perk, contribute to our vision. Change a life, if even for a few hours. The vibe at these events is indescribable. You can feel the love. Some of these special surfers don't speak, walk or communicate. But when they surf, you can see the pure joy. </div>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Some of these kids live very limited lives. Some shouldn't get their faces wet.  Think of life in a wheelchair. How exciting it must be to ride a wave? Yahoo(!), and you can see it in their faces. </div>
<div>To ensure their safety, we have special crews of 6 ""Special Ops"" volunteers. We have lifeguards and EMTs. An ambulance comes and parks at the beach (also volunteer). The town waives the parking permit requirements.  The ""Dog Monitors"" keep the dogs away from fearful participants. The neighbors put up with the hundreds of cars bombarding their quiet streets.  Some neighbors provide water and electricity. Local establishments donate shuttle services. In short, this community ROCKS!  We have an amazing volunteer crew and OH!, we've received the Points of Light award... </div>

<p>My name is Shonee, and I have been a Special Surfer volunteer since the beginning. Every month in the Summer I look forward to Special Surfer night because you just feel so good after playing in the water with these kids! It's an addicting feeling, kind of like that first time you surf down the line, but even more fulfilling!</p>
<p>I have had parents come up to me afterwards in tears because they have never seen their child show such an emotional response to anything before... and that is an incredible thing to be a part of.</p>
<p>Many of these kids can't express themselves, but when they are cruising down these waves you see their faces light up and their eyes sparkle!</p>
<p>I also do this because I think it's important for these kids to do something fun without having their parents or caregivers hovering over them.  </p>

Is the owner of Aquaholics Surf Shop and the director of Aquaholics Special Surfers. We have been offering this program since 2004.  Special Surfer Night started with three kids and the program has expanded from there.





Special Surfer Night



Special Surfer Night is a free program for children and young adults with physical, mental or emotional disabilities. We
currently offer eligibility for 100 Special Surfers for each of the three summer nights we offer the program. We recruit hundreds of volunteers. We provide wetsuits, boards and adaptive equipment.  These
Special Surfers often are unable to participate in many sporting activities due
to mental or physical limitations. When they come surf with us, they are
unlimited in the physical sense, since the ocean and board (and volunteers) do
all the physical and mental work. 




What we need
Aquaholics Surf Shop has been funding this program since 2004. With 100 kids on the roster, it has grown into something the shop can no longer fund. Now that we have established 501C3 Non-Profit status, we're asking for more help. We need boards, wetsuits, adaptive equipment, insurance, storage/transport trailer, web services, legal services & staff. We have truly outgrown our little program. 

We plan to buy 96 boards (we have a few from previous donors THANKS AGAIN!), 200 wetsuits (so many sizes need to be in multiples, and we need overlap), 6 adaptive chairs and tumble forms, harnesses, and straps, a trailer or van for storage and transport, incidentals like wetsuit shampoo, rinse buckets, signage, color coded tee shirts,  paper for forms, promo supplies, insurance, legal help and staffing. We've been at this for 11 years, we've got it wired! The budget for this is more than $55,000, (a lot more,) but we'll be happy to get what we can! 
Here's what the budget looks like, for the event in it's entirety, we're hoping to raise all of the funds needed by surpassing our goal, but the indiegogo data suggests it's better to start small and GO BIG, so we're asking you to help us get a jump on the order by at least covering equipment costs. In case you're grabbing your calculator, this comes to $109,541. 



This is what it takes for the immeasurable fun value (for everyone involved) and life changing experience for these kids and their families. Join the fun, share a good vibe.

How you impact our Supersurfers



This program is and has always been free. Often people suggest that we charge for this program. Not a chance. These kids and their families live everyday carrying a heavy load. Social, physical, mental. They have expenses we can't comprehend. This is our way of giving them an easy, free, no hassle mini vacation from the daily pressures of raising or caring for a kid or young adult (or being one) who constantly redefines what unconditional love requires. Pick a perk, contribute to our vision. Change a life, if even for a few hours. The vibe at these events is indescribable. You can feel the love. Some of these special surfers don't speak, walk or communicate. But when they surf, you can see the pure joy. 


Risks & ChallengesSome of these kids live very limited lives. Some shouldn't get their faces wet.  Think of life in a wheelchair. How exciting it must be to ride a wave? Yahoo(!), and you can see it in their faces. 
To ensure their safety, we have special crews of 6 ""Special Ops"" volunteers. We have lifeguards and EMTs. An ambulance comes and parks at the beach (also volunteer). The town waives the parking permit requirements.  The ""Dog Monitors"" keep the dogs away from fearful participants. The neighbors put up with the hundreds of cars bombarding their quiet streets.  Some neighbors provide water and electricity. Local establishments donate shuttle services. In short, this community ROCKS!  We have an amazing volunteer crew and OH!, we've received the Points of Light award... 

                                     



Fans, Heroes and Bios...
Hero Shonee Strickland 






My name is Shonee, and I have been a Special Surfer volunteer since the beginning. Every month in the Summer I look forward to Special Surfer night because you just feel so good after playing in the water with these kids! It's an addicting feeling, kind of like that first time you surf down the line, but even more fulfilling!
I have had parents come up to me afterwards in tears because they have never seen their child show such an emotional response to anything before... and that is an incredible thing to be a part of.
Many of these kids can't express themselves, but when they are cruising down these waves you see their faces light up and their eyes sparkle!
I also do this because I think it's important for these kids to do something fun without having their parents or caregivers hovering over them.

<p>Hip Hop Saves Lives is a non profit organization that
teaches humanity through Hip Hop, because Hip Hop came from humanity. Its
original purpose was to keep the kids out of the streets, as an alternative to
gangs and violence. In the words of its founder Kool Herc ""it was just a
way to reach the kids, it just happened to come through music"".
</p>
<p>The program proved to diminish violence, increase their
thirst for learning, as the program educates teenagers about issues they
may have never discussed and have no true interest in until they
investigate it through rhyme.</p>

(a bit more than) three wordsWe aim to break the cycle of poverty for the orphans and

The method ?
The children are involved with the
creation of a music album, where they are the writers of their own songs, based
on their own experiences.Through music and work as a team
towards a common goal, they find a sense of belonging.We teach them about the world they
live in, about everyday heroes and inspiring personalities. We encourage them
to share their experiences.Their desire to learn is boosted,
directly associating their hobbies to a pleasant learning experience.« Music
for the children in the DRC » allow them self-expression, to expand their
minds and become a part of who they are. It gives them the opportunity to break
the cycle of poverty and find their place in society.
It is a model that has proven itself countless times
before!









Our goal is
to inspire these underprivileged children and teenagers, to show them that
they also have a chance to succeed in life, that they are talented and have the
right to dream of a better life. We have to believe in them first so that they
dare to believe in themselves.

for the children in Congo ».


The
project

Music is a powerful tool. It is especially powerful, when it
is used to inspire and reach children and teenagers, allowing them to learn
about themselves and the world they live in, giving them back the confidence
they lost as marginalized youth.
We will fly to the DRC to meet with these children and
teenagers in Kinshasa. The method that is used to reach those children has
proven itself multiple times before with street youth in the United-States, but
also in Ghana and Liberia.

The
youth are encouraged to express themselves and think about their fears, their
joys, and hopes, as well as the people that inspire them, encouraging them to
reflect upon the world they live in. Together, they choose together a topic
about which they are going to write.
2. 
We
help them translate their feelings into words and record a song, that they
write and perform.
3.  We shoot a full-length video for
each song and post them on Youtube, allowing the youth to have a voice beyond
the borders and despite their situation.
4.  We take some time to reflect their work and what they
have learned through it.
5.  Lastly, at the end of the project, a
digital album is created and offered as a perk and sold online.
This program gives
youth global education and the opportunity to express themselves through doing
what they love, all while making a difference.
If the funds raised are high enough, we plan to expand our
project to several cities in Congo to have a bigger impact and help more youth
to find their voice.
If the goal is not reached, all the funds
raised will support projects in the DRC for these same children.




About CongoChance 

Paul is an abandoned child. Just like him, 20,000 children roam the streets of
Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). They are orphans, teenagers or abandoned children.
Illiterate
and often stigmatized, they have no possibility to afford education or to find
a job, remaining in the cycle poverty.
To break this cycle, CongoChance takes in those children and
give them a home. It aims to restore their place in the Congolese society by
schooling them, as well as allowing them to grow through sport, theater and
language lessons given by volunteers. We don't only want to get those children
out from homelessness, we want to fill their childhood with happy memories and
positive experiences.


About Hip Hop Saves Lives  


Hip Hop Saves Lives is a non profit organization that
teaches humanity through Hip Hop, because Hip Hop came from humanity. Its
original purpose was to keep the kids out of the streets, as an alternative to
gangs and violence. In the words of its founder Kool Herc ""it was just a
way to reach the kids, it just happened to come through music"".

The program proved to diminish violence, increase their
thirst for learning, as the program educates teenagers about issues they
may have never discussed and have no true interest in until they
investigate it through rhyme.


We
don't just teach humanity. We create humanitarians.

>>> En français

En (un
peu plus) de trois mots





Nous visons à briser le
cycle de la pauvreté pour les orphelins et enfants abandonnés du
Congo en les aidant à réaliser leur potentiel et renforcer leur
confiance en soi.


La méthode ?


Les enfants sont
	impliqués dans la création d'un album de musiques, dans lequel ils
	sont auteurs et interprètes de leurs propres chansons, basées sur
	leurs expériences personelles. 
	


A travers la musique
	et le travail d'équipe pour la concrétisation d'un but commun, ils
	trouvent un sentiment d'appartenance.


Nous les
	sensibilisons au monde qui les entoure, aux héros de tous les
	jours, à des personnalités inspirantes. Nous les encourageons à partager leurs expériences. 
	


Leur envie de
	s'informer et d'apprendre est ainsi décuplée, associant
	directement, loisir et plaisir d'apprendre.




« Musique pour les
enfants de la RDC » leur permet de s'exprimer, se libérer et
s'ouvrir au monde, leur donnant ainsi l'opportunité d'enrayer le
cycle de la pauvreté et trouver leur place dans la société.


C'est
un modèle qui a déjà fait ses preuves à maintes reprises !



Notre but est d'inspirer ces enfants et adolescents des
milieux défavorisés, leur montrer que eux aussi ont une chance de réussir dans
cette vie, que eux aussi ont du talent et qu'ils ont le droit de rêver à une
vie meilleure. Il faut tout d'abord commencer par croire en eux pour qu'ils
osent croire en eux-mêmes.
CongoChance s'associe avec Hip Hop Saves Lives et
Nunnovation pour le projet « Musique pour les enfants de la RDC ».



Le projet
La musique est un outil puissant. Il est particulièrement
puissant lorsqu'il est utilisé pour inspirer et toucher ces enfants et
adolescents, leur permettant d'en apprendre plus sur eux-mêmes et le monde dans
lequel ils vivent. Le processus de création leur rend ainsi leur confiance
perdue, ayant toujours été marginalisés.
Nous partirons en RDC pour rencontrer ces jeunes à Kinshasa.
La méthode utilisée pour toucher ces enfants a déjà fait ses preuves de
multiples fois dans les rues des Etats-Unis, mais aussi au Ghana et au Liberia.
Nous voulons leur montrer le chemin et les encourager à s'exprimer, à écrire
sur leurs peurs, leurs joies et leurs espoirs, écrire sur les personnes qui les
inspirent, les encourager à réfléchir au monde dans lequel ils vivent.

Les jeunes sont encouragés exprimer leurs peurs, leurs joies et leurs espoirs, à trouver l'inspiration à travers leurs modèles et le monde qui les entoure.

Nous
     les aidons ensuite à transposer leurs sentiments en mots et nous
     enregistrons la chanson dont ils sont auteurs et interprètes. 
Une
     vidéo est filmée pour chaque chanson créée et nous la publions sur Youtube,
     permettant ainsi aux jeunes de porter leur voix au-delà des frontières et
     malgré leur situation.
Nous
     prenons du temps pour les faire réfléchir sur ce qu’ils ont appris par
     leur travail.
Finalement,
     à la fin du projet, un album digital est créé et vendu en ligne.


Ce programme donne l’opportunité aux jeunes de s’instruire
et s’exprimer par ce qu’ils aiment faire, tout en ayant un impact positif.
Si les fonds rassemblés sont assez élevés, nous planifions
d’agrandir le projets à plusieurs villes du Congo afin d’augmenter l’impact du
projet et aider plus de jeunes à trouver leur voix.
Si l'objectif n'est pas atteint, tous les
     fonds recueillis serviront à financer les projets en faveur de ces mêmes enfants.




A propos de CongoChance



Paul est un enfant abandonné. Tout comme lui, 20'000 enfants èrent
dans les rues de Kinshasa, la capitale de la République Démocratique
du Congo (RDC). Ce sont des orphelins, des adolescents ou des enfants abandonnés.


Illettrés
et souvent stigmatisés, ils n'ont aucun accès à l'éducation et à
l'emploi, condamnés au cycle de la pauvreté.


Pour briser ce cycle, CongoChance
accueille ces enfants et leur donnent une maison, une famille. Nous
visons à leur redonner une place dans la société congolaise en
leur donnant accès à l'éducation, mais aussi à des activités
sportives, du théâtre, des lessons de langues données par des
volontaires. Nous ne voulons pas seulement offrir un toit à ces
jeunes, mais remplir leur enfance de souvenirs heureux et
d'expériences positives.




A propos de Hip Hop Saves Lives  


Hip Hop Saves Lives est une
organisation non lucrative qui enseigne l'altruisme aux jeunes grâce
au Hip Hop. Son but original était de sortir les enfants des rues de
New York, d'offrir une alternative aux gangs et à la violence. Avec
les mots de son fondateur, Kool Herc : « C'était juste un
moyen d'atteindre les jeunes, cela s'est simplement passé par la
musique ».


Le programme de Hip Hop Saves Lives a
déjà fait ses preuves, diminuant la violence et augmentant la soif
d'apprendre de ces jeunes en leur ouvrant les yeux sur des
problématiques dont ils n'ont auparavant souvent jamais parlé et
pour lesquelles ils ne s'intéressaient même pas avant de s'y
pencher par la rhyme.


Nous
n'enseignons pas seulement l'altruisme. Nous créons des altruistes.




A propos de Nunnovation  



Nunnovation met à disposition de la
société africaine une plateforme en ligne pour présenter leurs
innovations, partager leurs histoires à succès, célébrer
l'excellence et récompenser les actions désintéressées
d'individus, d'organisations et de gouvernements. Leur objectif est
de motiver la population africaine à tendre vers l'excellence pour
une croissance durable dans le continent.

Alphabet Mat’ with different design for different age group. What we found is that the kids from slum areas drop out from
schools because they start to see alphabets and receive education at the age of
4-5 years. The main difference between the early childhood education of a privileged
kid and the kids from slum areas is the early exposure to the learning
material. Thus we have designed our alphabet play mat which is:

<ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Printed
on durable outdoor PVC vinyl, the same material used on billboards beside
streets and highways.</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>It
costs only US<b>$3</b> to print and distribute 1 mat; less expensive than a cup of
coffee.</li>
<li>We
can distribute it to the target group at zero cost to them. </li>
<li>The
mat is washable, multipurpose and weather proof. A highly suitable learning material for slum areas which will be with the kids 24/7.</li>
<li>Mat with different
design for different age group. Such as very basic mat for the age of 6
months to 2 years, mat with advanced elements such as 'idea of time (clock)', 'color recognition' for the age group of 2-4 years. A
mat for 0-6 months target group can be designed to encourage breast feeding and
natal care. Following is a sample design of an advanced mat which will help to learn time and color:</li>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1314727/files/20150322071614-clock1_-_Copy.jpg?1427033774"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<li>Kids love game and games have different stages that they have to win. We will monitor the progress of a child and reward him/her with next mat with appropriate design to have a sense of game and fun in learning. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Older
kids in the slum areas will become the facilitator of the younger group while
playing on the mat, making the learning process sustainable at slum area.</li>
<li>Parents of the kids at slum do not need to go through any training or expense to be able to facilitate the learning. The mat is designed to reduce word gap by having a visual impact.  <br/>

<p>Our initial
target is the <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcmediaaction/entries/91569231-a81a-3a61-a766-a69f695eec1f"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Korail slum area </a>in Dhaka city of Bangladesh. Our estimates show
that there are about 40,000 people living in that close community with about
10,000 kids. We want to distribute at least 5000 durable alphabet mats to the
age group of 2-4 &amp; 4-6 years old kids. Each mat will cost us $3 and in
total we are seeking US$15,000 to cover the production cost. <br/></p>
<p><i>If we are able to raise $15,000, it will allow us to provide early childhood education (ECE) material to 5000 kids at slum. For every extra $3, one more child will be helped. There are thousands more kids in need of ECE and don't stop donating at $15,000. The more money we raise, the bigger impact we will have. </i><br/></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.brac.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BRAC</a> is the
largest NGO of the world and as a team from <a href=""http://www.bracu.ac.bd"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BRAC University</a>, our costs to travel
to and from the slum area will be covered by the official vehicle. Our time for
this project is totally free as we are helping these kids to come out of the
cycle of the poverty.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We cannot
build a better society without sharing the cost of social improvement and you
will become the part of the next wave of early childhood change by contributing
to this cause. $3 or even $30 to sponsor 10 mats may not put a dent on your wallet
but it will change the life of a kid and beyond. Won’t you feel good to be able

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>The impact
is straightforward. Currently kids at slum do not have appropriate early childhood
education material which can assist to reduce word gap. This mat will make
alphabet a part of their household and learning will not seem so hard once they
will get to the level of formal education at schools. At the end, the number of
school dropouts will be reduced and these kids will break the cycle of poverty
with their education.</p>
<p>We randomly picked a family living in slum and given a mat to Sadia (4 years) and her brother Belal (2 years) shown in the image below. The sister took the leadership straightway and started to help her brother play on the mat and learn. We expected this outcome but we were surprised to see such immediate impact. <br/></p>

President Bill Clinton gives a challenge to the university students worldwide
through the HULT Prize competition. The challenge for 2015 is to improve the early childhood education at urban slum area. Five of us from BRAC University,
Bangladesh formed a team to provide a solution and we came up with a prototype;
we named our brand ‘Sneho’. 


The core product of our solution is a ‘Durable
Alphabet Mat’ with different design for different age group. What we found is that the kids from slum areas drop out from
schools because they start to see alphabets and receive education at the age of
4-5 years. The main difference between the early childhood education of a privileged
kid and the kids from slum areas is the early exposure to the learning
material. Thus we have designed our alphabet play mat which is:



Printed
on durable outdoor PVC vinyl, the same material used on billboards beside
streets and highways.

It
costs only US$3 to print and distribute 1 mat; less expensive than a cup of
coffee.
We
can distribute it to the target group at zero cost to them. 
The
mat is washable, multipurpose and weather proof. A highly suitable learning material for slum areas which will be with the kids 24/7.
Mat with different
design for different age group. Such as very basic mat for the age of 6
months to 2 years, mat with advanced elements such as 'idea of time (clock)', 'color recognition' for the age group of 2-4 years. A
mat for 0-6 months target group can be designed to encourage breast feeding and
natal care. Following is a sample design of an advanced mat which will help to learn time and color:

Kids love game and games have different stages that they have to win. We will monitor the progress of a child and reward him/her with next mat with appropriate design to have a sense of game and fun in learning. 


Older
kids in the slum areas will become the facilitator of the younger group while
playing on the mat, making the learning process sustainable at slum area.
Parents of the kids at slum do not need to go through any training or expense to be able to facilitate the learning. The mat is designed to reduce word gap by having a visual impact.  

Location and culture independent. Design of the mat can be updated easily to meet the local demand. 


Download and read a report on our full product and services and please visit our website www.sneho.org for more information.


   What We Need & What You Get 
Our initial
target is the Korail slum area in Dhaka city of Bangladesh. Our estimates show
that there are about 40,000 people living in that close community with about
10,000 kids. We want to distribute at least 5000 durable alphabet mats to the
age group of 2-4 & 4-6 years old kids. Each mat will cost us $3 and in
total we are seeking US$15,000 to cover the production cost. 
If we are able to raise $15,000, it will allow us to provide early childhood education (ECE) material to 5000 kids at slum. For every extra $3, one more child will be helped. There are thousands more kids in need of ECE and don't stop donating at $15,000. The more money we raise, the bigger impact we will have. 
BRAC is the
largest NGO of the world and as a team from BRAC University, our costs to travel
to and from the slum area will be covered by the official vehicle. Our time for
this project is totally free as we are helping these kids to come out of the
cycle of the poverty.


We cannot
build a better society without sharing the cost of social improvement and you
will become the part of the next wave of early childhood change by contributing
to this cause. $3 or even $30 to sponsor 10 mats may not put a dent on your wallet
but it will change the life of a kid and beyond. Won’t you feel good to be able
to help in this noble way? This video shows the expression of a 13 months old baby when she sees the play mat for the first time. 
We then went to a urban slum area to distribute our product and watch the impact in this video. Don't you want to gift the same joy to thousands of kids at slum? Please donate if you care.


The Impact 
The impact
is straightforward. Currently kids at slum do not have appropriate early childhood
education material which can assist to reduce word gap. This mat will make
alphabet a part of their household and learning will not seem so hard once they
will get to the level of formal education at schools. At the end, the number of
school dropouts will be reduced and these kids will break the cycle of poverty
with their education.
We randomly picked a family living in slum and given a mat to Sadia (4 years) and her brother Belal (2 years) shown in the image below. The sister took the leadership straightway and started to help her brother play on the mat and learn. We expected this outcome but we were surprised to see such immediate impact. 


The family and the community appreciated the product as well. They were very happy to receive a learning material for their kids which is very suitable for their living environment. They appreciated the fact that the product does not involve any technology and easy to understand and maintain. They want more of it!

We have seen teams answering this challenge with technology such as mobile push message and other means of innovation. But we believe technology alone is not the answer to a social problem. We need to establish a process which tackles the early childhood education issue at its root and prepare kids for the formal education at the age of 5-6 years. Sneho offers such solution with its products and services, and we are aiming to make a big impact in the target community.  Following is our prototype:

<p>Fundraising

 the number of girls we seek to advocate for, increases. Our
 first student Jessica Peter, has already completed the course in tourism

dutifully managed into the budget of the next young woman we intend to directly
seek sponsorship for, and so on.</span><p></p></span></div>
</blockquote> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<span>Many
 women in the local area are up against family and cultural odds when 
seeking a career, not just one on the mountain. At just 16 years old, 
Jessica visited Lake Manyara National Park on a school trip, and her eye
 happened to catch one of the few female guides operating in Tanzania. 
Never before had she considered a career in guiding as a feasible option
 but through this encounter she became inspired to pursue her studies at
 a local college. Jessica was extremely blessed, her mother and 
brother supported her dreams and funded her education; she successfully 
graduated in 2013. Unfortunately, unemployment is soaring in this region and many local companies do not adhere to fair hiring

years.</span><br/><br/><span>F.A.W.K. was formed with reputable and well organized allies. NGO was instituted to set up a basic framework, set objectives, and financial expectations.  Nyange Adventures, a local tour and guide company, is respected

outreach. They are an integral part of this program and without them it 
would not be possible. The
 support structure at Nyange, and hands on training they are offering, 
will introduce this young woman to the best chance she will have at 
succeeding as a self- supporting woman. Their staff of skilled and socially adept 
mountain guides, are excited for the opportunity to mentor her in this 
process. We hope that then, Jessica too will be the inspiration for many
 girls to come. When we met with her about this opportunity her words 
cemented the motivation behind this project, Jessica said, 'I was just 
surviving in the dark until now, and now there is light.' Help us bring 
light over the mountain, now and many more times to come.</span><br/><span></span><br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges<br/>
</h3>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<span>In
 light of the fact that there is already a number of women working the 
mountain or interested in working, the biggest challenge we face is 
finding women who have family support, confidence in themselves, and are
 committed to the time table it takes to complete; education, 
training, proficient English and licensing. Many young women are 
expected to marry or have children but even if they do choose to have a 
family, if they are committed to having a career, they do not need to 
give up guiding or a career in tourism.  African Impact Director, Gill Carter, has also 
partnered on this initiative and will provide free English classes, and 
guidance through a local women's support network. <br/></span><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>I
 certainly understand that some folks find themselves more fortunate 
than others and in a seemingly sea of worthy causes we must all pick the
 ones most dear to our hearts. It is with this notion I implore you, 
that even if you feel you are unable to make a donation at this time, 
your support through social media, friends and family and word of mouth 
is invaluable to our cause. </div><blockquote></blockquote><p></p></div>","Short Summary

mountain or interested in working, the biggest challenge we face is 
finding women who have family support, confidence in themselves, and are
 committed to the time table it takes to complete; education, 
training, proficient English and licensing. Many young women are 
expected to marry or have children but even if they do choose to have a 
family, if they are committed to having a career, they do not need to 
give up guiding or a career in tourism.  African Impact Director, Gill Carter, has also 
partnered on this initiative and will provide free English classes, and 
guidance through a local women's support network. 

Other Ways You Can Help I
 certainly understand that some folks find themselves more fortunate 
than others and in a seemingly sea of worthy causes we must all pick the
 ones most dear to our hearts. It is with this notion I implore you, 
that even if you feel you are unable to make a donation at this time, 
your support through social media, friends and family and word of mouth 
is invaluable to our cause.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

To put this into perspective, it is roughly a little more than 5 times the size of our existing training area.  It is located on the second floor with elevator and stair access and will be wheelchair accessible.We plan to begin renovations in May.  The vision of the layout will include an extra large training area, a large training area, and several washrooms.  We will expand our programs in the future to offer pre-shool classes, more childrens classes, classes simultaneously for parents and children in separate rooms, beginner, intermediate, and advanced martial arts kung fu classes, meditation and Ch’an workshops, tai ji yang and chen styles, pregnancy exercise programs, public events, and more!  A high capacity ventilation system ensures a well controlled and healthy air environment.The new space will also include the first Shaolin Tea Cafe in Canada, offering a unique and peaceful  place for people to sit down and enjoy high quality tea and snacks while enjoying the energy of the environment.  This is an important strategic venture as it will become a stronghold for traditional Shaolin culture in Canada and a basis for growth and expansion.  It is my extended vision in support of my Shi Fu’s vision, which is to help people and communities through the traditional Shaolin arts.  I want this space to be a place that you will continue to be proud of.  The profits will be used for projects to help children, adults and seniors in need; the deaf, the blind, the poor, and those with other disabilities.  Profits will also be used to build the first Shaolin Retreat Centre at Rice Lake where we already have access to 40 acres of donated land.  You will be able to stay there for a weekend or a whole week for self-cultivation or join in kung fu camp programs.With your help we will arguably have the largest Shaolin and kung fu establishment in the downtown Toronto area if not the entire city!The initial investment cost is quite significant and at this time I am seeking financial assistance to ease cash flow as well help further renovations and allow better facilities.  My target is to raise $30K by July 1st, 2015.  There are many ways that you can help and I encourage you to participate in the future and success of our community.Yours Truly,Shi Chang Dao35th Generation Shaolin Disciple",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

In Namibia, wealthy people live in close proximity to super poor communities. Our aim is to help in the communities wherever we can.


Our main projects focus on feeding and education of very poor children, as well as access to health care. We also aim to create awareness in the wealthier community and get everyone involved in helping where they can.

Feeding underpriviliged children:

Our feeding projects function by collecting food from individual donors, restaurants and by collecting funds to support existing Soup Kitchens throughout the poor community.
Education:
Education Projects currently are focusing on building, supplying and supporting Community Day Care Centers throughout the informal settlements, who look after pre-school children and feed/educate them, while their parents are out working/looking for work.

Access to Medical Care:
Dr. Dirk Redman is a local G.P and works in private practice. He helps the local community who struggle to get health care from the overloaded government clinics. He helps them with free consultations and medicine, working together with government clinics to help seriously ill patients and by raising funds to pay for specialized treatment for underprivileged children, such as physiotherapy, Occupational therapy, X-rays, Surgery, Hearing and vision testing etc.We are having local fund raising events and collection points for people from Swakopmund, Namibia to donate and get involved.

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>I have been accepted for a PhD placement at the University of Leeds next year, which is home to the Centre for Ethnic and Racism Studies. I will be under the supervision of the inspirational Dr. Shirley Tate. My research is called ‘Black British and Mixed Race identity: The intersectionality between race, class and political affiliation’. I wish to explore this area of study through trying to understand why we have simultaneously seen a rise in the activity of black liberationist groups in the UK, and the largest number of Black Minority Ethnic (BME) people voting for the Conservative party in the 2015 election. This opportunity is very exciting for me, but the cost of part time tuition fees for the first 2 years at the University of Leeds is £4750, well out of the financial reach of  myself and my family. However, I believe that my research is of real value to the black and left wing community, and projects such as mine are where we should invest our support if we wish to create material changes and narratives that support the world we envisage.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479842664/mvtuuotu7iccbjzrwb8w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Project in brief </h3>
<ul>
<li>This research looks  at black identity through the simultaneous growth of black liberation politics and BME people voting for the Conservative party. </li>
<li>This research hopes to promote public academia  that produces knowledge that can be understood by more people and used in a democratic way to mobilise people against contemporary issues like racism. </li>
<li> To promote crowdfunding as a means to create a better world by investing in economic activity and narratives that support our values rather than investing our money and time in systems that oppress us.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Research  </h2>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>At a social gathering just prior to Jeremy Corbyn’s first overwhelming mandate to lead the Labour Party, I was chatting to my friend about what Corbyn’s victory could mean for a resurrection of left wing politics in the United Kingdom. Before I could reach my conclusion I was interrupted by a girl of the same mixed British/ Caribbean heritage as me. “Oh you’re a bounty, black on the outside, white on the inside” she interjected. For her perhaps, it was not the place of black people to talk about politics, or maybe like myself and many black radicals she was disillusioned with the parliamentary system, I fear it was the former. I thought short and brief about my response ‘Fuck you!’ I drunkenly replied. At first I felt angry at her for policing my identity, but this soon disappeared into sympathy, her analyses of me was a reflection of how larger social structures place whiteness and blackness in a binary.  ‘Fuck you’ was my rejection to societies idea that places blackness outside of the intellectual life of politics and inside the stereotype of “tom-toms, cannibalism, intellectual deficiency, fetishism, racial defects, slave-ships” (Fanon, 1952 [2008]:92).  I want to provide a more academic answer to society's white/black binary than ‘fuck you’.</p>
<p>For myself politics is inseparable from the social construction of blackness. Black liberationist and anti-fascist groups have fought for the inclusion of BME people in the public sphere in countries such as the United Kingdom, where even today the facts suggest a disproportionate amount of BME people exist economically and culturally at the peripheries of society. We have seen a rise in the action and coverage of black liberationist groups in the wider public domain with the creation of groups like Black Lives Matter, which have reawakened the political discourses of the civil rights movement. Following global trends, the United Kingdom has seen groups rallying against the violence of the state against black bodies, the gentrification and destruction of ethnic minority communities and the coloniality of education. Simultaneously, we have seen a rise in BME conservatism with the Conservative party getting over 1 million BME votes, the largest it has ever achieved (Survation, 2015).  This Conservative victory came despite numerous displays of racism within the Tory Party (Smith, 2016), and the disproportionately negative effect of Tory austerity on the ethnic minority/ ‘Black’ community (Runnymede Trust, 2015). Some commentators have even had the temerity to suggest that Black conservatism is a sign Britain is a ‘post-racial society’, due to a ‘normalisation of the black presence in Britain’ (Goodhart, 2011). This research hopes to answer three key questions in order to understand how the BME community can better mobilise itself from the peripheries of society to the centre.  </p>
<h3>Research questions</h3>
<p>1. What is the relationship between race, class and political affiliation in the identity formation of people of black and mixed race heritage?</p>
<p>2. How do people of mixed race heritage negotiate these aspects of identity and in particular the intersections of blackness and whiteness in their own identities?</p>
<p>3. What are the assumptions behind individuals being perceived as ‘race traitors’?</p>
<h3>Methodology</h3>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/yXeR6N98Ons?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>This research is dedicated to producing knowledge that is public and decolonised, what I mean by this is that I shall reject the academic snobbery and elitism of most work produced in the ivory towers of the university and instead opt for an approach of producing knowledge that is more participatory. My research respondents will be given greater agency and the results will be more open to being understood by wider sections of the public. To understand what it means to be black and mixed race in contemporary Britain, I will be have three main cohorts of participants: members of black liberationist groups, BME Conservative voters and Mixed Race people. I will use three methods to investigate my key questions:</p>
<p>Semi-Structured interviews: Using a Critical Race Theorist (CRT) perspective I will use semi-structured interviews to understand the experience and knowledge of my participants. Using Kimberlé Crenshaw I will look at how the different social categories of race, class and political affiliation interact on multiple and often simultaneous levels to create identity, other categories like gender and sexuality will be explored. In the case of mixed race participants, a key focus will be on which particular aspect of their experiences they identify themselves or perceive others to associate as either blackness or whiteness. Once the research has started I will allow my participants to label themselves. I will then use thematic and discourse analysis to analyse the interview transcripts across the three participant cohorts, focusing on identifying which ideas around what it means to be black are stable and contested. I will then show my analyses to my participants and give them a chance to respond to my analysis of their interview. By doing this I hope to avoid the academic trope of labelling communities in ways they disagree with and not providing them with any means of criticism.</p>
<p>Ethnography: I will use ethnography to study Black Liberationist Groups this means immersing myself in their meetings, protests and online activity. I hope to understand how these groups mobilise to solve issues they believe to be in the black interest. I wish to negotiate access to groups like Black Lives Matter UK, London Black Revolutionists and Black student groups. Ethnography as a research methodology has been utilised to study the inner workings of political organisations. It is anticipated that this ethnographic fieldwork will develop insight into how these groups can better mobilise to oppose racism.</p>
<p>Open question/ Open 'creative' response: This will achieve greater equality between the power of myself the researcher and my participants by asking the participants to respond in any way they wish to the question: ‘What does it mean to be black (or however they identify) in Britain today?’. Knowledge can be produced in multiple pluriversal ways, yet Eurocentric academia prioritises essays written by academics/ experts. Black culture has used various vernacular art forms to express knowledge about Black experience from poets like Linton Kwesi Johnson and Dean Atta, to Grime and Rap Artists like Akala and Dizzee Rascal. My open question will allow my participants to respond in any way they wish. The knowledge produced by the open question will be open to wider audiences. The creative responses of my participants will be displayed online.</p>
<div> </div>
<h3>Research Impact </h3>
<p>I hope that my research will help to achieve three things: </p>
<p>1)From the ethnography of the black liberationist groups I wish to provide an analysis on how best these groups can mobilise the black community into a unified struggle against racism and its consequence. </p>
<p>2)  I want to start a discussion on black identity through the research website where the public can submit their own creative expression of what it means to be black. I hope through this website people can share experience and understand the broad nature of black identity and the need for solidarity against common issues. </p>
<p>3) I hope that this research will encourage more people from communities that exist at the  peripheries of society to invest and start small projects that challenge inequality. </p>
<p>lastly, I hope this research will promote research values. </p>
<h2>My research values </h2>
<h3>1: A rejection of the neo-liberal marketisation of education  </h3>
<p> At the same time as the government initiative 'Widening Participation' encourages more students from under-represented groups to go to university; there have been changes such as the increase of tuition fees to £9000 (of which I was in the first cohort of students to pay), and the abolition of student maintenance grants (from which I benefited immensely). These changes have left poorer students leaving university in huge amounts of individual debt, and disincentivised state school students from going to university. The marketisation of higher education entrenches social class immobility. Education is a social good and therefore shouldn’t depend on the wealth of a young person’s parents. Consequently, I believe that communities from under-represented groups should crowdfund academics and knowledge that will be empowering to the community and a challenge to the narratives of neoliberalism which creates social stagnation. The more individuals from minority groups we can get into institutions the more power we will have to change institutions from the inside for the benefit of all.  We have to be responsible and invest in economic activity and create narratives that challenge the status quo.</p>
<h3>2: The production of a public sociology</h3>
<p>This research will be a piece of public sociology; this is sociological knowledge that is created for wider non-academic communities. Too many academics write about important contemporary issues in a way that can only be understood by audiences within the ivory towers of the university. This means knowledge produced by the university is usually of no practical use to the communities that it is concerned with. This means only experts have the knowledge to make decisions, which could be made more democratically by the mobilisation of a well-informed community. This research will produce multiple forms of knowledge that can be digested by different communities in the forms of layman language, explanations of technical terms and the production of creative works by the researches participants. My goal is to become a public academic and produce knowledge that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>owned by the public</li>
<li>understood by the public</li>
<li>practical in solving contemporary problems relevant to the public</li>
</ul>
<h3>3: The decolonisation of knowledge</h3>
<p>As you will see in my research proposal I will decolonise my research process by producing pluriversal forms of knowledge. This means I am attempting to redress the unbalanced power dynamic between myself the researcher and the research respondents. Respondents will be able to identify themselves and everything written about them will be in layman language so that they can respond if they believe they have unfairly represented. Crowdfunding BME students also provides more routes into the academic profession in which they are highly unrepresented. Lack of BME staff means that BME students rarely see role models from their own communities and therefore the academy doesn't seem like their place. More BME staff would help to propel changes to university curriculums that are Eurocentric and ignore the contributions of non- white academics.     </p>

</div></div>","Introduction
I have been accepted for a PhD placement at the University of Leeds next year, which is home to the Centre for Ethnic and Racism Studies. I will be under the supervision of the inspirational Dr. Shirley Tate. My research is called ‘Black British and Mixed Race identity: The intersectionality between race, class and political affiliation’. I wish to explore this area of study through trying to understand why we have simultaneously seen a rise in the activity of black liberationist groups in the UK, and the largest number of Black Minority Ethnic (BME) people voting for the Conservative party in the 2015 election. This opportunity is very exciting for me, but the cost of part time tuition fees for the first 2 years at the University of Leeds is £4750, well out of the financial reach of  myself and my family. However, I believe that my research is of real value to the black and left wing community, and projects such as mine are where we should invest our support if we wish to create material changes and narratives that support the world we envisage.  

Project in brief 

This research looks  at black identity through the simultaneous growth of black liberation politics and BME people voting for the Conservative party. 
This research hopes to promote public academia  that produces knowledge that can be understood by more people and used in a democratic way to mobilise people against contemporary issues like racism. 
 To promote crowdfunding as a means to create a better world by investing in economic activity and narratives that support our values rather than investing our money and time in systems that oppress us.

Research  
Rationale
At a social gathering just prior to Jeremy Corbyn’s first overwhelming mandate to lead the Labour Party, I was chatting to my friend about what Corbyn’s victory could mean for a resurrection of left wing politics in the United Kingdom. Before I could reach my conclusion I was interrupted by a girl of the same mixed British/ Caribbean heritage as me. “Oh you’re a bounty, black on the outside, white on the inside” she interjected. For her perhaps, it was not the place of black people to talk about politics, or maybe like myself and many black radicals she was disillusioned with the parliamentary system, I fear it was the former. I thought short and brief about my response ‘Fuck you!’ I drunkenly replied. At first I felt angry at her for policing my identity, but this soon disappeared into sympathy, her analyses of me was a reflection of how larger social structures place whiteness and blackness in a binary.  ‘Fuck you’ was my rejection to societies idea that places blackness outside of the intellectual life of politics and inside the stereotype of “tom-toms, cannibalism, intellectual deficiency, fetishism, racial defects, slave-ships” (Fanon, 1952 [2008]:92).  I want to provide a more academic answer to society's white/black binary than ‘fuck you’.
For myself politics is inseparable from the social construction of blackness. Black liberationist and anti-fascist groups have fought for the inclusion of BME people in the public sphere in countries such as the United Kingdom, where even today the facts suggest a disproportionate amount of BME people exist economically and culturally at the peripheries of society. We have seen a rise in the action and coverage of black liberationist groups in the wider public domain with the creation of groups like Black Lives Matter, which have reawakened the political discourses of the civil rights movement. Following global trends, the United Kingdom has seen groups rallying against the violence of the state against black bodies, the gentrification and destruction of ethnic minority communities and the coloniality of education. Simultaneously, we have seen a rise in BME conservatism with the Conservative party getting over 1 million BME votes, the largest it has ever achieved (Survation, 2015).  This Conservative victory came despite numerous displays of racism within the Tory Party (Smith, 2016), and the disproportionately negative effect of Tory austerity on the ethnic minority/ ‘Black’ community (Runnymede Trust, 2015). Some commentators have even had the temerity to suggest that Black conservatism is a sign Britain is a ‘post-racial society’, due to a ‘normalisation of the black presence in Britain’ (Goodhart, 2011). This research hopes to answer three key questions in order to understand how the BME community can better mobilise itself from the peripheries of society to the centre.  
Research questions
1. What is the relationship between race, class and political affiliation in the identity formation of people of black and mixed race heritage?
2. How do people of mixed race heritage negotiate these aspects of identity and in particular the intersections of blackness and whiteness in their own identities?
3. What are the assumptions behind individuals being perceived as ‘race traitors’?
Methodology

This research is dedicated to producing knowledge that is public and decolonised, what I mean by this is that I shall reject the academic snobbery and elitism of most work produced in the ivory towers of the university and instead opt for an approach of producing knowledge that is more participatory. My research respondents will be given greater agency and the results will be more open to being understood by wider sections of the public. To understand what it means to be black and mixed race in contemporary Britain, I will be have three main cohorts of participants: members of black liberationist groups, BME Conservative voters and Mixed Race people. I will use three methods to investigate my key questions:
Semi-Structured interviews: Using a Critical Race Theorist (CRT) perspective I will use semi-structured interviews to understand the experience and knowledge of my participants. Using Kimberlé Crenshaw I will look at how the different social categories of race, class and political affiliation interact on multiple and often simultaneous levels to create identity, other categories like gender and sexuality will be explored. In the case of mixed race participants, a key focus will be on which particular aspect of their experiences they identify themselves or perceive others to associate as either blackness or whiteness. Once the research has started I will allow my participants to label themselves. I will then use thematic and discourse analysis to analyse the interview transcripts across the three participant cohorts, focusing on identifying which ideas around what it means to be black are stable and contested. I will then show my analyses to my participants and give them a chance to respond to my analysis of their interview. By doing this I hope to avoid the academic trope of labelling communities in ways they disagree with and not providing them with any means of criticism.
Ethnography: I will use ethnography to study Black Liberationist Groups this means immersing myself in their meetings, protests and online activity. I hope to understand how these groups mobilise to solve issues they believe to be in the black interest. I wish to negotiate access to groups like Black Lives Matter UK, London Black Revolutionists and Black student groups. Ethnography as a research methodology has been utilised to study the inner workings of political organisations. It is anticipated that this ethnographic fieldwork will develop insight into how these groups can better mobilise to oppose racism.
Open question/ Open 'creative' response: This will achieve greater equality between the power of myself the researcher and my participants by asking the participants to respond in any way they wish to the question: ‘What does it mean to be black (or however they identify) in Britain today?’. Knowledge can be produced in multiple pluriversal ways, yet Eurocentric academia prioritises essays written by academics/ experts. Black culture has used various vernacular art forms to express knowledge about Black experience from poets like Linton Kwesi Johnson and Dean Atta, to Grime and Rap Artists like Akala and Dizzee Rascal. My open question will allow my participants to respond in any way they wish. The knowledge produced by the open question will be open to wider audiences. The creative responses of my participants will be displayed online.
 
Research Impact 
I hope that my research will help to achieve three things: 
1)From the ethnography of the black liberationist groups I wish to provide an analysis on how best these groups can mobilise the black community into a unified struggle against racism and its consequence. 
2)  I want to start a discussion on black identity through the research website where the public can submit their own creative expression of what it means to be black. I hope through this website people can share experience and understand the broad nature of black identity and the need for solidarity against common issues. 
3) I hope that this research will encourage more people from communities that exist at the  peripheries of society to invest and start small projects that challenge inequality. 
lastly, I hope this research will promote research values. 
My research values 
1: A rejection of the neo-liberal marketisation of education  
 At the same time as the government initiative 'Widening Participation' encourages more students from under-represented groups to go to university; there have been changes such as the increase of tuition fees to £9000 (of which I was in the first cohort of students to pay), and the abolition of student maintenance grants (from which I benefited immensely). These changes have left poorer students leaving university in huge amounts of individual debt, and disincentivised state school students from going to university. The marketisation of higher education entrenches social class immobility. Education is a social good and therefore shouldn’t depend on the wealth of a young person’s parents. Consequently, I believe that communities from under-represented groups should crowdfund academics and knowledge that will be empowering to the community and a challenge to the narratives of neoliberalism which creates social stagnation. The more individuals from minority groups we can get into institutions the more power we will have to change institutions from the inside for the benefit of all.  We have to be responsible and invest in economic activity and create narratives that challenge the status quo.
2: The production of a public sociology
This research will be a piece of public sociology; this is sociological knowledge that is created for wider non-academic communities. Too many academics write about important contemporary issues in a way that can only be understood by audiences within the ivory towers of the university. This means knowledge produced by the university is usually of no practical use to the communities that it is concerned with. This means only experts have the knowledge to make decisions, which could be made more democratically by the mobilisation of a well-informed community. This research will produce multiple forms of knowledge that can be digested by different communities in the forms of layman language, explanations of technical terms and the production of creative works by the researches participants. My goal is to become a public academic and produce knowledge that is:

owned by the public
understood by the public
practical in solving contemporary problems relevant to the public

3: The decolonisation of knowledge
As you will see in my research proposal I will decolonise my research process by producing pluriversal forms of knowledge. This means I am attempting to redress the unbalanced power dynamic between myself the researcher and the research respondents. Respondents will be able to identify themselves and everything written about them will be in layman language so that they can respond if they believe they have unfairly represented. Crowdfunding BME students also provides more routes into the academic profession in which they are highly unrepresented. Lack of BME staff means that BME students rarely see role models from their own communities and therefore the academy doesn't seem like their place. More BME staff would help to propel changes to university curriculums that are Eurocentric and ignore the contributions of non- white academics.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>My name's Roberta Verdant. I'm a freelance writer and workshop facilitator. I believe in the de-stigmatisation of death and dying, and that dying and grieving people need more support of every kind. I want to help dying people to have the best deaths possible. This'll involve training as both a <a href=""http://soulmidwives.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Soul Midwife</a> - a companion to dying people - and as a <a href=""http://www.psychopomps.org/what-is-a-psychopomp.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">psychopomp</a> (a soul guide to the dying).  </p>
<p>I see this as a challenging, important, and profoundly beautiful service to provide for a largely death negative world. <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/roberta-verdant/death-midwife_b_8846322.html?"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here's a blogpost from me at The Huffington Post about it.</a></p>
<p><strong>Why I'm drawn to working with death</strong></p>
<p>My pull towards this path is threefold: personal, spiritual and social. These elements cross over.</p>
<p>I can't remember a time in my life when I wasn't aware of grief, and the hidden/secret quality death often commands in our world. Though I have lost people I love, those weren’t my first experiences of grief.  </p>
<p>I am a third generation descendant of Holocaust survivors. 40 of my ancestors were decimated by the Nazis. There were few survivors on that side of my family, but I have known several of them, to varying degrees: my grandmother, great aunts and great grandmother, all of whom survived concentration camps. Many years after her time in Auschwitz, my grandmother is now 92 years old.</p>
<p>I always loosely knew this part of my family's history, and grew up acutely aware of grief which wasn’t being communicated. At some point in my childhood, my grandmother first began to tell stories about that time. There were also stories never detailed to me, which I would later piece together.</p>
<p>As an adult, I've undertaken a vast amount of work to provide space for some of these stories. I've also weathered years of chronic physical illness, and found a lot of peace with my own mortality.</p>
<p>These various aspects of my experience have fed my conviction that we need space for our most difficult stories around death and dying - and for grief itself. Dying people need more care, support and companionship. Soul Midwives' training (followed by voluntary ‘sitting with the dying’) will teach me how to safely offer that.</p>
<p>I feel that within any community, people need to be supporting one another at every stage, in myriad ways. In my training, I’ll learn both holistic and practical methods of offering assistance to dying people, e.g. helping them to plan for their deaths.</p>
<p>I'm self-aware, boundaried, open and non-judgmental. I can't think of any more positive action I'd like to enact in this world than to go into communities and help support the dying. I'm also a Pagan, so dedicated to the practise of earth/nature spirituality. I believe in keeping my spirituality socially engaged. Companionship to the dying is (in part) my offering in those terms.</p>
<p>My Pagan path has always been partially a Shamanic one. Training in the role of psychopomp (a soul guide to the dying) feeds into this, and will serve as complementary to my study in Soul Midwifery.</p>
<p>Through training and volunteering, I envisage creating a metaphorical toolbag – but in order to do this, I need your help. My income as a writer isn’t high. Until recently, I had been housesitting almost full-time for several months, which means I've been able to keep many of my practical expenses low. However, I currently lack the funds necessary to start my training.</p>
<p>If you're able to financially contribute, I'm offering various rewards. </p>
<p><strong>Rewards</strong><br/><br/><strong>One, two or four letters from my journey</strong></p>
<p>I'll keep you informed of my progress as I undertake my journey to work with the dying, in the form of receiving one, two, or three letters. (Obviously, I'll never disclose confidential information within these). You'll be able to both get a sense of what your contribution has helped fund, and follow me on my path.</p>
<p><strong>One hour one-to-one Skype writing session</strong></p>
<p>My background is as a workshop facilitator. I love facilitating writing workshops. So here, I'm offering guided writing sessions. These can either focus on a topic of your choice, or be writing sessions I'll create on the themes of death and dying. </p>
<p><strong>One hour one-to-one Skype conversation about death and dying</strong></p>
<p>A conversation between the two of us on the themes of death/dying/mortality: these sessions aren't therapy, but offer non-judgmental time and space for you to share whatever you'd like on this theme.  </p>
<p><strong>I write for you!</strong></p>
<p>I'm a published author of prose, poetry and non-fiction, with a particular interest in rewriting fairy tales and mythology. So I'm offering to write for you. You provide a prompt (which we agree upon) and tell me whether you want me to write a story, poem, or rework a myth or fairy tale. I write it. It becomes your property (though please cite me as author!).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A breakdown of my costs</strong></p>
<p>£227: to pay off the balance of my psychopomp training.</p>
<p>£70: for my Soul Midwifery introductory training. This is a mini-bursary which Felicity Warner, who runs the Soul Midwives school, has very kindly offered me.</p>
<p>£750: to cover my Soul Midwives’ practitioner training, level one.</p>
<p>£350: to cover accommodation for the training. </p>
<p>£203: to cover travel expenses.</p>
<p>£85: to cover the 5% Indiegogo receives.</p>
<p><strong>Total: £1,685</strong></p>
<p>If I raise some funds but don't succeed in reaching my goal, I'll still be able to use any money raised towards my training. All contributions are most welcome. If you’re not able to financially contribute, sharing on my campaign (Indiegogo has helpful share tools), as well as telling others about the campaign and/or publicising it would be extremely helpful and much appreciated. </p>
<p>Here's a little beauty surrounding death: Bristol's lovely Arnos Vale cemetery. </p>

As an adult, I've undertaken a vast amount of work to provide space for some of these stories. I've also weathered years of chronic physical illness, and found a lot of peace with my own mortality.
These various aspects of my experience have fed my conviction that we need space for our most difficult stories around death and dying - and for grief itself. Dying people need more care, support and companionship. Soul Midwives' training (followed by voluntary ‘sitting with the dying’) will teach me how to safely offer that.
I feel that within any community, people need to be supporting one another at every stage, in myriad ways. In my training, I’ll learn both holistic and practical methods of offering assistance to dying people, e.g. helping them to plan for their deaths.
I'm self-aware, boundaried, open and non-judgmental. I can't think of any more positive action I'd like to enact in this world than to go into communities and help support the dying. I'm also a Pagan, so dedicated to the practise of earth/nature spirituality. I believe in keeping my spirituality socially engaged. Companionship to the dying is (in part) my offering in those terms.
My Pagan path has always been partially a Shamanic one. Training in the role of psychopomp (a soul guide to the dying) feeds into this, and will serve as complementary to my study in Soul Midwifery.
Through training and volunteering, I envisage creating a metaphorical toolbag – but in order to do this, I need your help. My income as a writer isn’t high. Until recently, I had been housesitting almost full-time for several months, which means I've been able to keep many of my practical expenses low. However, I currently lack the funds necessary to start my training.
If you're able to financially contribute, I'm offering various rewards. 
RewardsOne, two or four letters from my journey
I'll keep you informed of my progress as I undertake my journey to work with the dying, in the form of receiving one, two, or three letters. (Obviously, I'll never disclose confidential information within these). You'll be able to both get a sense of what your contribution has helped fund, and follow me on my path.
One hour one-to-one Skype writing session
My background is as a workshop facilitator. I love facilitating writing workshops. So here, I'm offering guided writing sessions. These can either focus on a topic of your choice, or be writing sessions I'll create on the themes of death and dying. 
One hour one-to-one Skype conversation about death and dying
A conversation between the two of us on the themes of death/dying/mortality: these sessions aren't therapy, but offer non-judgmental time and space for you to share whatever you'd like on this theme.  
I write for you!
I'm a published author of prose, poetry and non-fiction, with a particular interest in rewriting fairy tales and mythology. So I'm offering to write for you. You provide a prompt (which we agree upon) and tell me whether you want me to write a story, poem, or rework a myth or fairy tale. I write it. It becomes your property (though please cite me as author!).
 
A breakdown of my costs
£227: to pay off the balance of my psychopomp training.
£70: for my Soul Midwifery introductory training. This is a mini-bursary which Felicity Warner, who runs the Soul Midwives school, has very kindly offered me.
£750: to cover my Soul Midwives’ practitioner training, level one.
£350: to cover accommodation for the training. 
£203: to cover travel expenses.
£85: to cover the 5% Indiegogo receives.
Total: £1,685
If I raise some funds but don't succeed in reaching my goal, I'll still be able to use any money raised towards my training. All contributions are most welcome. If you’re not able to financially contribute, sharing on my campaign (Indiegogo has helpful share tools), as well as telling others about the campaign and/or publicising it would be extremely helpful and much appreciated.

<h3><strong>What is Let's Talk Equality?</strong></h3>
<p>Founded by two eighteen year old high school students, Let's Talk Equality is a project based on social entrepreneurship. Anna Hasselgren and Tilde Holm, founders of Let's Talk Equality and bloggers for Girls' Globe, wanted to expand the conversation about the current midwife crisis. White Ribbon Alliance is an incredible organisation that takes maternal health issues very seriously. They do amazing work in their Alert Villages, where the volunteers educate and help families realise the importance of maternal health. We need to support grassroots movements, just like the White Ribbon Alliance (WRA), to fight for things important to women and girls. Therefore, we will be visiting White Ribbon Alliance in Jakarta in February 2017, to document and produce a short documentary series in three parts, to be used to promote their work, raise awareness and inspire others to take action. The documentary films will include interviews with midwives, the head coordinator and also shoots from their Alert villages. </p>
<p>We must do something about the midwife crisis. In Indonesia, only 73% of babies are born attended by skilled personnel. With a little help from you, we can inspire others to make a difference for mothers around the world.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Climbing is a sport that teaches life skills that will benefit kids on an immeasurable scale, from the hard skills of knot tying, to the soft skills of encouraging a friend to get to that next hold and achieve that next level. It encourages relationship building, trust, mental and physical awareness, problem solving, fitness and of course fun and adventure!  Sadly in recent times, our community has been affected by youth suicides, drug addiction and overdose.  This programming can be used as a tool to create a proactive approach to our children, our community, mental health and wellness from a young age. Unfortunately to date our reactive approach has often come too late. This competition will allow us to introduce a large volume of kids to the sport of climbing, promoting leadership qualities, a healthy and active lifestyle while creating a positive culture of adventure in our community.    </p>
<h3>About Us</h3>
<p><strong>Hoodoo Adventures:</strong></p>
<p>Founded in 2007, Hoodoo Adventures provides quality outdoor adventures, Indoor Climbing and team events that truly highlight the best the Okanagan has to offer. Hoodoo Adventures has brought together some of the most energetic, personable and dedicated individuals in the industry. They have been selected for their passion, outstanding instructional skills, playful attitudes and their knowledge of safety management with a wide range of backgrounds, experience and qualifications.</p>
<p>In February 2016 Hoodoo Adventures expanded and built a climbing gym in the community of Penticton, a town world-renowned for its outdoor climbing. Since then the climbing gym has been providing exceptional climbing programs for youth and adults alike, however due the high cost of the build the gym is not complete and their offerings have been limited.  </p>
<p>Lyndie Hill, the founder of Hoodoo Adventures, is passionate about getting kids active and away from their screens.  She has spent 15 years developing successful programs that engage youth in outdoor activities and invested countless hours in fundraising efforts with the goal that all the children in the community will have equal opportunity at outdoor education.  </p>
<p><strong>YORS</strong></p>
<p>Founded in May 2016, The Youth Outdoor Recreation Society (YORS) is devoted to providing opportunities for mainstream and at-risk youth in the Okanagan to participate in outdoor recreation, education and leadership activities by subsidizing programming within the community. These activities will provide a platform to help youth develop and nurture their physical, emotional and intellectual selves by enhancing their relationship with, and confidence in the natural environment.</p>
<p><strong>Our Goal</strong></p>
<p>YORS in partnership with Hoodoo Adventure Company wants to host a kids climbing competition. We believe that an open competition  will be a great way to encourage and engage youth in the sport of climbing. Indoor climbing is a great activity for youth during the winter months and helps to promote a healthy and active lifestyle, keeping them busy and away from those screens!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>​ Our goal is to raise $10,000 which will be used to buy safety equipment and the supplies needed to host our climbing competition. Most of your contributions will be used to complete the safety/crash mats in the gym. Currently half of our gym has crash mats but we need to put them throughout the entire climbing area before we can have enough space to host a competition and full programming.</p>
<p>With the rest of the money we will purchase more kid friendly climbing holds and help subsidize school groups to come and try out the gym.  Given the small ratios of instructors to kids, climbing programs can be expensive, but this is also what makes them so unique and therapeutic.  In a classroom kids share their teachers with 25+ other children, when climbing kids have the opportunity to create a one on one bond/trust with their leader and their peers.  </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal we will continue to raise the remainder of the money through special events and fundraisers. </p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>Donations over that are $1000 or more will receive a free year membership at the climbing gym.</p>
<p>Donations of $200 or more will receive a free 10 punch pass that can be shared with others.</p>
<p>Donations of $40 or more will receive 10% off their next visit to Hoodoo Adventures Climbing Gym.</p>

Hilliard, III. </p><h3>What We Do:</h3><p>The primary mission of the ASA Restoration Project is to complete the excavation and restoration of two 2,700 year-old tombs located on the west bank of Luxor, Egypt near the Valley of the Kings and Queens.  The importance of this archeological and cultural work for Africans and African Americans is the direct connection to the history and legacy of the greatest people on earth.  Without a true and comprehensive understanding of the incredible ancestry of Black people, we remain lost and disconnected from our past which keeps us from fulfilling our ordained destiny.  So, everything in these tombs that is uncovered and restored is another critical piece of our history which serves as a reminder of who people of African ancestry are and our remarkable contributions to human civilization.</p><h3>Historical &amp; Cultural Significance:</h3><p>Dr. Elena Pischikova, director of the South Asasif Conservation Project, discovered these ancient tombs in 2006. Her partnership with the ASA Restoration Project has resulted in discoveries that have shed light on one of the most overlooked periods in Egyptian history. The tombs were built to honor Karabasken and Karakhamen who lived during the 8th century B.C. They were the final resting place for two members of the Kushite royal family that ruled Egypt during the 25th dynasty. Both tombs were carved into the limestone bedrock and each has a staircase that descends 20 feet into the earth and terminates at a large open-air sun court. At the western end of the sun court is a subterranean tomb that consists of pillared halls that lead to a burial chamber.</p><p>We now know that Karabasken was the mayor of the ancient city of Luxor – the administrative and religious capital of ancient Egypt. Karabasken also supervised the restoration of the Temples of Luxor and Karnak, which are two miles apart but are connected by an avenue of 1350 sphinxes and were the site of spectacular annual festivals. </p><p>We now know that Karakhamen was a priest at Karnak Temple, which is the largest temple in the world and the residence of Amen (the unseen presence of God Almighty). Karnak Temple is said to have housed over 83,000 priest and priestesses, while we don’t yet know the exact role Karakhamen played at Karnak, the size and grandeur of his tomb is an indicator his importance.</p><p>The tomb of Karakhamen is four times larger than the tomb of King Tut. Even though it was robbed of its treasures long ago, it contains a treasure trove of literary and architectural artifacts. Karakhamen’s tomb consists of two pillared halls inscribed with text from The Book of the Hours, The Book of the Dead and Pyramid Text. Every inch of his tomb was carefully carved with hundreds of lines of text and dozens of painted images. </p><p>Karakhamen’s burial chamber is 60 feet underground and is accessed via a large shaft. Its walls are beautifully adorned with painted images of the “weighing of the soul” and the 42 judges of the deceased. The ceiling is painted with a wonderful image of Nut, the goddess who represents the Milky Way.</p><h3>Why We Do It:</h3><p>The reconstruction of Karakhamen’s tomb can only be fully appreciated when looking at before and after photos of our work. One of our most significant accomplishments was the reconstruction of the western wall and False Door at the end of the 2nd pillared hall. This wall depicts offerings to Karakhamen and Ausar and was constructed 40 feet above the burial chamber.</p><p>The speed with which the 2nd pillared hall was reconstructed was made possible by the generosity of Douglas Barnes who purchased a stone cutting machine for us in 2014. We will unveil the newly restored 2nd pillared hall on September 24, 2016 at a ribbon cutting ceremony with the Governor of Luxor, Minister of Antiquities and other dignitaries. </p><p>In 2014 we began excavating in front of Karabasken’s tomb and uncovered a staircase that led to an impressive large open-air sun court that allowed us to directly access the underground tomb. We began excavating Karabasken’s burial chamber in June 2016 and we made one of our biggest discoveries to date. We uncovered a ramp that descended into the burial chamber at a steep 45˚ angle and found the burial chamber filled with flood debris. When the debris was removed weeks later we found the 2700 year-old surprise was patiently waiting for us for so many years. Protocol prevents me from revealing any more details until the Minister of Antiquities releases news of our discovery but believe me…it is huge!</p><p>Recent excavations of the superstructure surrounding both tombs revealed the ancient remains of pylons that were constructed at the entrance to the staircase, sun court and tomb. Since pylons were typically built at the entrances to temples, their presence now suggests that these tombs were originally built as Temple Tombs, similar to the ones built in ancient Kush.</p><h3>How Your Investment Can Make A Difference:</h3><p>Unfortunately, both tombs have been ravaged by man and nature since their construction. Over the centuries they have been used as a residence, stable and quarry by local residents. They have also been subjected to numerous floods that have covered them under millions of tons of debris. But thru the hard work of Dr. Pischikova, and the fundraising efforts of the ASA Restoration Project, we have been able to excavate and restore both tombs and slowly reconstruct the lives of Karabasken and Karakhamen.</p><p>Every year of excavation yields new discoveries that dramatically increase our understanding of the Kushite presence in ancient Egypt. The ASA Restoration Project is proud to be the first and only African American organization to fund excavations in Egypt and conduct primary research on the world’s oldest documented civilization.</p><p>We are grateful to the hundreds of people who have supported the work of the ASA Restoration Project through their generous contributions over the past eight years and we trust that the fruits of our labor have proven be a worthwhile investment. </p><p>We have done good work, but we still have much more work to do. The transformative impact of our discoveries for people of African ancestry cannot be overstated, so your gift can be impactful not just for the study of history, but for Black youth, families and communities in America and the world. Our annual expenses for excavation and restoration have doubled since we are now working in two tombs and the value of fundraising has never been greater. This new crowd funding campaign represents our desire to reach a larger audience and secure new investments so that we may close our 2016 season with the resources to purchase tools and equipment for our 2017 season to accelerate our work and create new discoveries that further validate the unparalleded impact of Africans on the world.</p><p>We invite you to share the information below with your family, friends and associates, and we are offering the following premiums for your continued support of our work.</p><ul>

It has expanded steadily since then and now offers a 3-6 year old kindergarten program as well, prompting us to change our name to 'Helena River Steiner School' this year. We also run a craft group where parents can learn new skills whilst making toys for the school, as well as a study group where people can learn about the philosophies that underpin Steiner education.  Both groups are open to wider community.</p><p>Our school has expanded quickly and we need primary classrooms and resources to sustain the education of our children as they grow older. There are also families in the wider community with primary age children who are very keen to move to a Steiner school once we have a class to offer them. The next step for us is to expand our programs for a primary classroom and all the resources and equipment that will require - inside and outside the classroom. We are in the process of applying for school registration (which will attract some funding), however, it is a long process and until then we need all the help we can to get established.</p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487605970/qvmtv9ejirnaworttmii.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3><h3>Our Location</h3><p>We are located in the very central suburb of Midland, just a two minute walk from the railway station, and within 1 km of the beautiful Helena River.

We want to be the literal owners of our fruits of labor. The ImpactAs we are dependent on funds that are generated by volunteers or guests who stay at our Fairstay, our means to invest in the garden are very limited. Through this campaign we would like to raise awareness but also try to raise funds to make a thorough investment in the garden so that the trees grow stronger and their roots can grow deeper.Fruitfriends  Laos is not a very big but definitely a transparant  organization. We have a local Laotian team and are founded by a Belgian-Laotian couple.Everybody who visits Laos is amazed by the enormous diversity of vegetables, fruits and non-timber-forest-products that are part of the daily life of Lao people. Our garden only represents only a small segment of that diversity.Through our garden we have two goals to accomplish:
Income generation by easy accessibility for (foreign) visitors in order to promote biological farming
Easy accessibility for local farmers in order to promote biological farming in the area
 The GardenA lot of Lao people use a 'slash and burn'-method in order to clear land. The problem with this method is that all the nutrients disappear and afterwards the remaining soil is dry and very poor.In the garden itself, we are looking at the future. We want to establish a sustainable 'food forest' but in order to do this we first need to have sufficient trees to provide a protective layer for the smaller layers. These trees need to grow before anything else can be possible. We believe in restoring the soil.Our trees have many purposes:
create a greater resistance against heavy rainfall or droughts
provide a larger amount of biomass to return to the soil (leaves, branches, fruit,...)
their roots will capture more nutrients in the soil
these roots will imrove the soil structure
prevention of erosion
preservation of water in the soil through their roots
 Other Ways You Can HelpYou can't contribute? Bo bpen nyang as we say here or no problem :), but spread the word! Maybe you know people who can contribute.Also, we will update the perks & media, so keep coming back to see what has changed.Make your trip to Laos or Southeast Asia for example unforgettable by combining this with a stay @ Fruitfriends Laos. Either as a volunteer or just as a guest to experience Lao culture and the beauty that is Vang Vieng.We have already established educational infrastructures in two villages, see below. For more information: http://www.fruitfriendslaos.orgFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/FruitFriendsLaosIn order to keep the rights to the garden and be able to water the plants for the next year, we need to gather 9000 dollars in total. If we do not reach this goal, well, first of all, we at Fruitfriends Laos will be very, very, very sad. This because we have lost the garden and also a good friend, Onkeo. Where will my contribution go to, since there is no more garden?Luckely Fruitfriends Laos has another destination for your support: investing in the building of a new school in a rural community of Vang Vieng. And we will update our campaignpage so to have our loyal supporters know where their contributions went to. What about my perks?Perks requiring the presence of the garden or Onkeo can of course not be fullfilled, since we have lost te garden. We will do our best to fullfill the other perks as soon as the campaign ends. Is Fruitfriends Laos a non-profit organisation?Yes, definitely but for technical reasons we can not use this titel in our indiegogo-campaign, since only US-bases non-profit-organisations can do this as they have to provide a Tax Identification Number (EIN or Employer Identity Number)... and we really don't have this as a Laos-based non-profit organisation. Hopefully this in the future non-US non-profits will be able to register on Indiegogo as well.",14.0,5,"1 Campaign
