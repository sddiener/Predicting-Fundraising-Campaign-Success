<p>The PureBalaton Eco Resort concept consists of 12 gorgeous thatched-roof residences and they are intended to open during the Summer of 2018. Each of the Eco residences will be a one-story structure with a small swimming pool located on the terrace. The living area will consist of six to eight beds, a living room, small kitchen and bath area. Within the resort, the main building will be placed facing a private lake and it will facilitate all common services like reception, restaurant, cafeteria and lobby. The Eco residences will feature excellent views of the surrounding landscape, including the charming turquoise lake Balaton. The parking area will be covered with solar panels serving as the energy supply of the Eco Resort. </p>

<p>We will combine the <strong>highest standards of hospitality, smart technologies, renewable energy sources to reach sustainable zero carbon emission operations with an affordable luxury guest experience.</strong> We will design and develop the first self-managing hotel system for various operations, which will serve our guests' convenience and greatly reduce energy consumption.</p>
<p>As global trends are trickling into the hospitality industry the <strong>smart technologies, mobile apps, ultra-personalized services and self-managing systems become essential.</strong> The concept of luxury seems to revise itself as exclusivity becomes fashionable. However the availability of <strong>new information technology not only allows for convenience, but it also helps in the optimization of energy consumption</strong>, which is an important factor for an Eco Resort such as PureBalaton. Thus some global trends allowed by advanced technologies may play together well with environment-friendly practices.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Why should I support European plant conservation project if my country of residence is out of Europe?</strong></p>
<p>A: Plants are universally recognized as a vital component of the world's biological diversity and an essential resource for the planet. Cultivated and wild plants across the globe are used to provide foods, medicine, fuel, shelter, decoration and materials for construction. So too, plants provide an array of ecosystems services, generating oxygen, sequestering carbon, reducing soil erosion to name but a few of the vital actions performed. Saving the biological diversity can be effective and successful only with worldwide unity and actions, regardless of where we live, we are part of the same ecosystem.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Q: Which threatened species planned to be conserved in PureBalaton Botanic garden?</strong></p>
<p>A: We plan to save and restore native deciduous trees, shrubs and wildflower meadows according to local plant conserving strategy aimed to be prepared from your donation.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Q: Is there any similar Eco Resort in Hungary with plant conservation and restoration program?</strong><br/>A: No, this is a completely new idea, and yet there is no similar Eco Hotels in Hungary and Central Europe, either.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Q: What happens to my money once I have donated?</strong><br/>A: The money will be put into a secure trust account and only used for the purpose of proceed this project.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Q: Is my donation tax deductible? </strong><br/>A: Unfornatelly not, we are not a registered charity.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Q: What are PureBalaton plans for the far future? </strong><br/>A: Our long term goal is Pure’YOURDESTINATION’ Eco Resort being a global brand with franchises all over the world providing tourists with all the advantages that has made franchise chains of a super Hospitality brand so successful, a recognizable brand, design, high quality service, marketing, social media presence. In addition our garden will be used for research and educational activities to proactively promote the development of other seed saving organisation, community groups and train future heritage gardeners and guardians.<br/> </p>

</div></div>","The potential impacts of growth on the environment, along with factors such as global climate change, have become particularly hot topics within the travel and tourism industry today. In order to launch our idea as a Startup enterprise we examined the relationship between the governing principles of Green tourism and environment protection, along with predictable trends in the future. 

The PureBalaton Eco Resort concept consists of 12 gorgeous thatched-roof residences and they are intended to open during the Summer of 2018. Each of the Eco residences will be a one-story structure with a small swimming pool located on the terrace. The living area will consist of six to eight beds, a living room, small kitchen and bath area. Within the resort, the main building will be placed facing a private lake and it will facilitate all common services like reception, restaurant, cafeteria and lobby. The Eco residences will feature excellent views of the surrounding landscape, including the charming turquoise lake Balaton. The parking area will be covered with solar panels serving as the energy supply of the Eco Resort. 


The PureBalaton Eco Resort is designed to put visitors in direct contact with nature by minimizing both the visual and environmental impact on the landscape with low-profile structures. 

We will accomplish a Green operation program and Green  purchasing policy to save as much as waste and energy is possible applying the current innovation.

We will combine the highest standards of hospitality, smart technologies, renewable energy sources to reach sustainable zero carbon emission operations with an affordable luxury guest experience. We will design and develop the first self-managing hotel system for various operations, which will serve our guests' convenience and greatly reduce energy consumption.
As global trends are trickling into the hospitality industry the smart technologies, mobile apps, ultra-personalized services and self-managing systems become essential. The concept of luxury seems to revise itself as exclusivity becomes fashionable. However the availability of new information technology not only allows for convenience, but it also helps in the optimization of energy consumption, which is an important factor for an Eco Resort such as PureBalaton. Thus some global trends allowed by advanced technologies may play together well with environment-friendly practices.

 
Garden guide system - The Interactive Botanical Garden
The people use traditional navigational signs for their everyday routes like roads, traffic signs, buildings, different maps. Today we have an easy way to get from A point to B point because the traditional signs and SMART tools help us. We feel safe when traveling and during navigation. But how do we feel our self in the nature? Without the conventional navigational signs? Most of us feel lost and uncomfortable, isn’t it?We have the knowledge for keeping the people feel safe when they are in nature far from the ordinary navigational signs. And more... Our idea supports our safety and give information about the nature surrounds us.

 
There are only a few option exists for real Zero-Carbon hotels when they choose a management system for its operation. These game changer hotels seriously consider emerging technologies like SMART tools, mobile, IoT, assets collaboration, big data should, predictive operation, energy management but these functions mostly missing from the current management systems. Now it is time to develop a new supporting tool, a totally new infrastructure for Zero-Carbon Eco hotels because these enabling green technologies can give us more advantages when collaboration each-other, operating on the highest level of synergies.








Pursuing green practices in a hotel operation is a win-win situation because we can reduce operational costs while also reducing harmful impacts on the environment.

According to our expectations and reports illustrated in the topic

Energy and water consumption costs may be reduced by more than 30 %
Carbon emission may be reduced by 35% due to the available and currently applied green technologies moreover implementing 14 ha (34 ac) botanical garden - can absorb 176 ton (388 th lb) Carbon Dioxide -  we can achieve carbon neutral operation; more info: http://www.purebalaton.com/project/market-overview

Solid waste will reduce significantly by 70% thanks to local purchase concept
Staff motivation, employee retention and community relations will be improved
We may benefit from higher customer loyalty

Q: Why should I support European plant conservation project if my country of residence is out of Europe?
A: Plants are universally recognized as a vital component of the world's biological diversity and an essential resource for the planet. Cultivated and wild plants across the globe are used to provide foods, medicine, fuel, shelter, decoration and materials for construction. So too, plants provide an array of ecosystems services, generating oxygen, sequestering carbon, reducing soil erosion to name but a few of the vital actions performed. Saving the biological diversity can be effective and successful only with worldwide unity and actions, regardless of where we live, we are part of the same ecosystem.
Q: Which threatened species planned to be conserved in PureBalaton Botanic garden?
A: We plan to save and restore native deciduous trees, shrubs and wildflower meadows according to local plant conserving strategy aimed to be prepared from your donation.
Q: Is there any similar Eco Resort in Hungary with plant conservation and restoration program?A: No, this is a completely new idea, and yet there is no similar Eco Hotels in Hungary and Central Europe, either.
Q: What happens to my money once I have donated?A: The money will be put into a secure trust account and only used for the purpose of proceed this project.
Q: Is my donation tax deductible? A: Unfornatelly not, we are not a registered charity.
Q: What are PureBalaton plans for the far future? A: Our long term goal is Pure’YOURDESTINATION’ Eco Resort being a global brand with franchises all over the world providing tourists with all the advantages that has made franchise chains of a super Hospitality brand so successful, a recognizable brand, design, high quality service, marketing, social media presence. In addition our garden will be used for research and educational activities to proactively promote the development of other seed saving organisation, community groups and train future heritage gardeners and guardians.",42.0,0,"1 Campaign

The kit, besides the bag, may include several accessories, described in the following.

<p><strong>Body of the bag</strong>: they are outlines in felt, made with natural wool only, in three different colors (brown, light brown, white), corresponding to the different fleece of the sheeps. The felt contains vegetable fibers. No chemical additive or colorant is present. This material, produced in Italy, was chosen because the wool is often considered a waste, since its use in the textile industry is continuosly decreasing for economic reasons. The outlines are already bunched and ready for easy assembly.</p>

<p><strong>Inserts in olive wood</strong>: they are several accessories (buckles, buttons, bottom of the bag, a pendant) made of Italian olive wood, coming not from the cutting of trees, but from the annual pruning.  </p>

<p><strong>Material for stitching</strong>: Natural hemp, product by the enormous potential  gone into disuse, but which during past years has supported the Italian agricultural economy. Its reintroduction is therefore desirable.</p>
<p><strong>Needles</strong>: in the kit two needles in olive wood are included. </p>
<p><strong>Booklet</strong>: in the kit there is also a booklet made of recycled paper. It has a cover in natural felt and tying in hemp yarn. Inside are some explanatory pages, with a strong scientific basis, but easy to read, showing the benefits for the environment related to this alternative form of trade, and the relationships with climate change. In the booklet there are also some blank pages for taking notes.</p>
<p><strong>Accessories</strong>: The Deluxe kit, besides the bag, includes a number of accessories, sold separately too, to be assembled: Tablet Case, Mobile Case, Multifunction Purse, Wallet. </p>

<p><strong>Customization</strong>: there are different options of customization. In particular, the customer can choose to use different buttons, other from the ones supplied by us, recycling old bags or dresses, or can add little pendants to the bag, making her/his personalized CareBag. Moreover, within the kit we provide an additional shoulder strap and an additional outline for the front of the bag, in white felt. <strong>You can color the white felt and /or the hemp string, available in the kit, with several natural materials</strong> <strong> </strong> <strong>(e.g. turmeric for yellow, turnip for pink) or with food colorants.</strong><strong> In this way, the customer can choose if having some of the pieces of the bag in brown, or white, or other colors.

<p><strong>CIRCULAR ECONOMY</strong>, the foundation of this project, is closely related to the concept of sustainable development, based on the idea of an economic system designed to regenerate itself, and on the creation of a sustainable production system that transforms or reuses materials previously wasted into goods and products with an economic value. </p>

<p>The basic concept of the project is expressed through the following simple key words:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Self-production (do it yourself)</strong>: defined as the new sustainable road of design. The self-production is related to the concept of hand-crafted and artisan production, based not on the speed of industry, but on the duration of action.  </li>
<li>
<strong>Modularity</strong>: You can add pieces, they are good alone or as a part of a set.</li>
<li>
<strong>Open source</strong>: the project idea is a form of Open source around people and their objects, where the factory is a social, territorial, entrepreneurial pattern composed of studios, small artisans laboratories, using internet as commercial channel. This represents a ""slow"" model of consumption; the price of the product is built through a pact of equity between those who design, those who produce, those who distribute and consumers.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project is the accomplishment of a ""<strong>multi skill concept</strong>"", a production process where the capabilities and contributions of all actors in the supply chain (<strong>designers, makers, web community, customers)</strong> are put together to arrive at the final product. The product is complete and assumes its final configuration thanks to the final customer, who can customize it; he knows that his product is a unique piece, because is not the result of an industrialized process, but of a self-production. </p>

<p>We are a small company, we worked mostly on services for greening the world. This is our first product. Right now we have the complete prototype, we know where to get materials, everything is ready for production. We are asking for<strong> your support to start our production</strong>.  We carefully calculated how much funding we need to start a level of production that can allow us to remain on the market and in the short term to begin also the production of other models of the bag. The environmental commitment involves some higher than normal costs, but we think this is right, we really want to make a difference.</p>

<p>According to our business plan, we will use about 40% of our funding goal for the raw materials, another 20% for packaging and shipping, 15% fixed costs, 15% services, about 10% for Indiegogo fees.</p>

That’s why we have a scientific approach in our production, always seeking for eco-innovation. <strong>Our mission is to make easier to be green.</strong> For five years we have been a service company. <strong>Chameleon</strong> is a brand by CARE. That's why our symbol is the chameleon. Chameleon is committed to Ecoevents, Ecomanagement and, starting from 2015, Ecocommerce. It means that we are starting with the CareBag project to provide green products also. But ours are not products only. With our products we want to keep to share and disseminate our educational message for the environment.</p>

<p>Despite this is a new project, we are confident that we have taken all the actions necessary to start the production, but.... we won't be able to make this happen without your support! <br/>Of course, all businesses face risks and challenges, but we have tried to minimize them. <br/>This is not just an idea, we have a complete working prototype for the CareBag.

For this reason we believe that there is no risk of the product not fulfilling our expectations, in terms of quality, shape, cost, environmental impact. The supply chain is minimized, because we have a potential substitute supplier for each raw material. We also can exclude our management problems, since manufacturing is based in one place only, just close to our company headquarter,  our eco-designer will follow personally the production, and we trust in this project becoming a success.

CareBag is an assembly kit for a bag and accessories entirely made with natural materials: natural felt, olive wood, hemp string. You can also buy assembly kits for accessories (mobile case, tablet case, wallet and multifunction purse). Make your own bag!  It is not just a bag, but a container of good practices and environmental sensibility. It is easy to assemble, easy to carry, simple and beautiful as the nature surrounding us. The main features of CareBag are: Eco-sustainability, Do It Yourself, Customization, Educational value.

Our market choices affect our Planet. If we choose CareBag instead of another bag we are paying more attention to the environment.  
You can help us to make a difference. Be part of our project. All together we can make a difference!
 

CareBag is an assembly kit for an eco sustainable bag, with customizable assembly paths, created by a green designer. Main features:  


Green Product: high quality, 100% eco sustainable and natural.  

Do it yourself: simple and fun product to assemble.  

Customization: alternative assembly paths, and creation of customized accessories.  

Educational value: a small booklet will be provided, with a strong scientific basis that will show the environmental advantages of the kit, useful also for taking notes.

Buying online a CareBag, a customer receives at home a package with components to be assembled, 100% natural and eco sustainable. Different options allow for a customization of the bag. The kit, besides the bag, may include several accessories, described in the following. You can buy the bag only, the bag with all the accessories, which is the “Deluxe” kit, or the accessories alone.
With CareBag, let also fashion be green, and especially available for all!
 

 

Body of the bag: they are outlines in felt, made with natural wool only, in three different colors (brown, light brown, white), corresponding to the different fleece of the sheeps. The felt contains vegetable fibers. No chemical additive or colorant is present. This material, produced in Italy, was chosen because the wool is often considered a waste, since its use in the textile industry is continuosly decreasing for economic reasons. The outlines are already bunched and ready for easy assembly.

Inserts in olive wood: they are several accessories (buckles, buttons, bottom of the bag, a pendant) made of Italian olive wood, coming not from the cutting of trees, but from the annual pruning.  

Material for stitching: Natural hemp, product by the enormous potential  gone into disuse, but which during past years has supported the Italian agricultural economy. Its reintroduction is therefore desirable.
Needles: in the kit two needles in olive wood are included. 
Booklet: in the kit there is also a booklet made of recycled paper. It has a cover in natural felt and tying in hemp yarn. Inside are some explanatory pages, with a strong scientific basis, but easy to read, showing the benefits for the environment related to this alternative form of trade, and the relationships with climate change. In the booklet there are also some blank pages for taking notes.
Accessories: The Deluxe kit, besides the bag, includes a number of accessories, sold separately too, to be assembled: Tablet Case, Mobile Case, Multifunction Purse, Wallet. 

 
Packaging: The shipping box is free of glue and made of certified PEFC cardboard.

Customization: there are different options of customization. In particular, the customer can choose to use different buttons, other from the ones supplied by us, recycling old bags or dresses, or can add little pendants to the bag, making her/his personalized CareBag. Moreover, within the kit we provide an additional shoulder strap and an additional outline for the front of the bag, in white felt. You can color the white felt and /or the hemp string, available in the kit, with several natural materials   (e.g. turmeric for yellow, turnip for pink) or with food colorants. In this way, the customer can choose if having some of the pieces of the bag in brown, or white, or other colors. All the tips and instructions for coloring are contained in our booklet, that will be provided together with the assembly kit. 


  
Assembling CareBag and all the accessories is not difficult at all, because all the outlines in felt are already bunched! Basically, you just have to insert the thread in the designated holes.
The assembly of the bag takes about one hour and a half, while the assembly of each accessory takes about half an hour. Moreover, we prepared step by step video instructions in which every single step is explained in details.
 


 
And following, just one of the video instructions for the accessories. You can watch all them on our YouTube channel.
MOBILE CASE

 
 
 
   
CIRCULAR ECONOMY, the foundation of this project, is closely related to the concept of sustainable development, based on the idea of an economic system designed to regenerate itself, and on the creation of a sustainable production system that transforms or reuses materials previously wasted into goods and products with an economic value. 



 
The basic concept of the project is expressed through the following simple key words:  


Self-production (do it yourself): defined as the new sustainable road of design. The self-production is related to the concept of hand-crafted and artisan production, based not on the speed of industry, but on the duration of action.  

Modularity: You can add pieces, they are good alone or as a part of a set.

Open source: the project idea is a form of Open source around people and their objects, where the factory is a social, territorial, entrepreneurial pattern composed of studios, small artisans laboratories, using internet as commercial channel. This represents a ""slow"" model of consumption; the price of the product is built through a pact of equity between those who design, those who produce, those who distribute and consumers.

This project is the accomplishment of a ""multi skill concept"", a production process where the capabilities and contributions of all actors in the supply chain (designers, makers, web community, customers) are put together to arrive at the final product. The product is complete and assumes its final configuration thanks to the final customer, who can customize it; he knows that his product is a unique piece, because is not the result of an industrialized process, but of a self-production. 
 
 

Our project is planet-friendly, as we explained before. However, we cannot avoid shipping your perks! We will compensate the CO2 emissions due to shipping with the planting of trees in a plot of land of our property. ONE PERK ONE TREE! 

Periodically, we will publish on our Facebook page photos of the trees planted.
If you choose the perk ""One week in Umbria, the green heart of Italy"", you will see the plantation. The field is just around the country house were you will stay.

 


People sensitive to the environmental message  
People who like the do-it-yourself or want to accept the challenge  
People who like useful objects and design  
People having a shop such as pub, etc., to organize groups for sharing the experience of assembling the bag

<p>Farr Hotels &amp; Resorts is a startup aiming to disrupt the $500 Billion Hospitality Industry, while also helping to improve the food and menus that are available at hotels throughout the country. </p>
<p>Many if not all of you have stayed in a hotel during your life. Very few of you have probably stopped to think about how bad the environmental impact of these hotels can be.

<p>Farr Hotels &amp; Resorts will work extremely hard to become the world leader in better hotel food.</p>
<p>Help us reach our goal, and help make the world a taster place.</p>

<h3>Origin of Leefz Hempwear</h3>
<p>About two years ago, Leefz was founded by three friends from The Netherlands to undertake action against one of the largest polluters in the world; the clothing industry. Leefz creates sustainable T-shirts from a material that has been used for centuries; hemp. Hemp fabric has many benefits like being naturally anti-bacterial, anti-microbial, breathable and it gets softer with every wash.</p>
<p>Traditional clothing is made from ordinary cotton and synthetic fabric which have huge negative impact on the environment. The clothing made from these fibers may be good for the profits of the major clothing brands but is devastating for the environment. Looking to make an alternative for ordinary clothing Leefz Hempwear was born.</p>
<p>Leefz Hempwear aims to be a pioneer in the sustainable clothing industry and wants to undertake action against the second largest polluter in the world.</p>
<p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565791090/ggoozll6xbtcwzbzhjz8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

</div>
<h3>Where are we now?</h3>
<p>After 2 years of research, samples and testing we discovered the best fit, feel and looks for our T-shirts. We have chosen a simplistic but beautiful design with the Leefz logo on the chest. The shirts are made from 55% hemp and 45% cotton. The hemp makes the shirt more sustainable, durable and tough. The cotton fiber is still needed to soften the fabric to keep the fabric nice and soft and to ensure a comfy fit.</p>
<h3>Why Not 100% Hemp?</h3>
<p>When Leefz started we aimed for 100% hemp, after receiving mutiple samples from multiple suppliers we found out that the shirt looses its softness and it can get very itchy. We found out that the blend of 55% hemp, 45% cotton gives the shirt a comfortable feel and fit.<br/><br/>This does not mean that Leefz is not searching for other ways to make the our shirt more sustainable. Currently we are looking into other materials like bamboo to blend with hemp to make our shirt even more environmental friendly!

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>To realize our first collection of hemp T-shirts and keep things like our website up and running we need €2500. If we reach the goal of €2500, we will also launch a white hemp T-shirt with a black Leefz logo. </li>
<li>If we don't reach our entire goal we still can ship out the black First Edition T-shirts but we will do it on a smaller scale. </li>
<li>With €2500 our research on shirts with a higher percentage of hemp will go way faster. Our goal is to keep the comfort the shirt has now, but to use a higher percentage of hemp. </li>

<h3>Backyard Aquaponics</h3>
<p>Aquaponics  refers to any system that combines conventional aquaculture (raising aquatic animals such as snails, fish, crayfish or prawns in tanks) with hydroponics (cultivating plants in water) in a symbiotic environment.</p>
<p>My name is Chuck Conti and I am on a mission. A mission to make food production more local. (And what is more local than your own backyard?) To make our food safer, healthier and readily available. For the last four years I have watched, read and searched for any information I could find on growing hydroponically and now, aquaponically. I have had great success growing hydroponically with NFT, DWC,Aeroponic and Flood and Drain Hydroponic systems that I designed and built with the information I have discovered.</p>
<p>There is a great injustice facing us all. Food is produced in this country by large corporations with profit in mind and no regard as to what the effect will be on peoples health. Food production where the more chemicals used on our food, the more profit. A lot of our food production is now controlled by chemical companies and it is time that we say enough is enough. It is time to take more control over the foods we feed our families and not leave it in the hands of a profit hungry chemical company.</p>
<p>By contributing to my campaign you will be helping to change how the world eats. Thinking globally and acting locally.</p>
<p>Some of the problems with our current system:</p>
<ul>
<li>16 million American kids struggle with hunger each year.</li>
<li>An estimated 48.8 million Americans , including 16.2 million children, live in households that lack the means to get enough nutritious food on a regular basis.</li>
<li>It is estimated that the average American meal travels about 1500 miles to get from farm to plate. Why is this cause for concern? There are many reasons: This long-distance, large-scale transportation of food consumes large quantities of fossil fuels, requires foods to be picked before ripe reducing their nutritional value and requiring preservatives to be sprayed on them.</li>
<li>Between 500 and 1,000 insect and weed species have developed pesticide resistance since 1945 which means stronger and more chemicals need to be used.</li>
<li>Genetically modifying our foods is then required (with unknown consequences) so that they are more resistant to those chemicals, delivering more poisons to your table.</li>
</ul>

Aquaponics  refers to any system that combines conventional aquaculture (raising aquatic animals such as snails, fish, crayfish or prawns in tanks) with hydroponics (cultivating plants in water) in a symbiotic environment.
My name is Chuck Conti and I am on a mission. A mission to make food production more local. (And what is more local than your own backyard?) To make our food safer, healthier and readily available. For the last four years I have watched, read and searched for any information I could find on growing hydroponically and now, aquaponically. I have had great success growing hydroponically with NFT, DWC,Aeroponic and Flood and Drain Hydroponic systems that I designed and built with the information I have discovered.
There is a great injustice facing us all. Food is produced in this country by large corporations with profit in mind and no regard as to what the effect will be on peoples health. Food production where the more chemicals used on our food, the more profit. A lot of our food production is now controlled by chemical companies and it is time that we say enough is enough. It is time to take more control over the foods we feed our families and not leave it in the hands of a profit hungry chemical company.
By contributing to my campaign you will be helping to change how the world eats. Thinking globally and acting locally.
Some of the problems with our current system:

16 million American kids struggle with hunger each year.
An estimated 48.8 million Americans , including 16.2 million children, live in households that lack the means to get enough nutritious food on a regular basis.
It is estimated that the average American meal travels about 1500 miles to get from farm to plate. Why is this cause for concern? There are many reasons: This long-distance, large-scale transportation of food consumes large quantities of fossil fuels, requires foods to be picked before ripe reducing their nutritional value and requiring preservatives to be sprayed on them.
Between 500 and 1,000 insect and weed species have developed pesticide resistance since 1945 which means stronger and more chemicals need to be used.
Genetically modifying our foods is then required (with unknown consequences) so that they are more resistant to those chemicals, delivering more poisons to your table.

През 2017 взех назаем видео камера, която за щастие отчасти полицията намери и ми върна, но към камерата вървяха аксесоари, които в последствие трябваше да платя, което ми струваше около 400лв, след като се върнах в България.

I am an adventurer with a free spirit. In 2016 together with my wife, we drove our legendary Opel Rekord built 1979, from Bulgaria to India. Our plan was to give birth to our first baby in India. We have started from Bulgaria in late October and have reached India in December just in time for the baby to be born which happened in January 2017. You can read more on the topic covered by Opel at – <a href=""https://opelpost.com/07/2017/samiras-first-trip/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://opelpost.com/07/2017/samiras-first-trip/</a></p><p>We have stayed in India until June 2017 when we flew back home. We left the car in India and in August 2017 I went back to pick it up. I had an ambitious plan, to drive from Shimla to Tabo and Spiti Valley and then if still possible to bring the car to Leh and from there to go over Kardungh La at 5615m above sea level, to continue to Srinagar and from there back to Amritsar and the border with Pakistan. Unfortunately, my adventure was stolen along the way. One night in a small village in Rajasthan where I was camping, my car was broken into. Somebody broke the side window at the driver side while I was not attending the car and stole all my belongings. I have overtrusted the villagers as I usually do and they have taken advantage of stealing all my camera equipment, in the face of my beloved Nikon Df along with 5 lenses Nikkor Ais 28mm f2.8, Nikkor Ais 105mm f2.5, Nikkor Ai 80-200mm f4.5, Nikkor AF 50mm f1.8, Samyang 14mm f2.8, and a camcorder which I have borrowed from a Bulgarian TV Station, but the worst was that they have also found and stolen my wallet with my travel documents, so I have lost my passport and the adventure was killed just at its birth. I was fortunate enough to have my car papers intact.</p><p>You may say I am stupid to leave my documents inside the car, but I can not break my perception to trust immensely people. When I am traveling I am roaming alone surrounded by people who have all the power to help me, to hinder my plans, to do anything with me. If I keep too much tension on what negative can happen it will eventually happen anticipating it, or I will live through it any second I am in a foreign land. My principle is to surrender and to embrace whatever life serves me. And life has plenty of surprises at hand. I was penniless and the people from the police department gathered money - a total of 7000 INR - 100 EUR, to help me with the travel expenses, to get with the car to Delhi to report at the embassy of my country. I was also released paying toll road tax with a special letter prepared by them. A heart-touching gesture of people with an immense heart.</p><p>A week after the robbery, the police found and returned to me my driving license and the borrowed camcorder, the rest was never found.</p><p>Next, I went through a tough process on acquiring a temporary passport stamped with all the necessary visas, which at one point seemed impossible to be done from inside India and I was very close to go back to Bulgaria by air just because of some ridiculous bureaucracy rules. Thanks to the help of some open-minded government officials of 3 different countries I was free to go limited only by the duration of my temporary passport which the Bulgarian government has issued to be valid for only 30 days from which 15 were lost on visas and the remaining 2 weeks were a hectic driving back home through 4 countries. A friend of mine Radoslav Kolev came to India after I had acquired all the needed documents and helped me drive the car back to Bulgaria. Here you can find pictures of the return trip taken by him on his phone - <a href=""http://kolev.info/files/rekordtrip/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://kolev.info/files/rekordtrip/</a></p><p><strong>Mission</strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553263982/lcpfiqtnmc3aqa2cuxw9.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p>The Opel Rekord is a legendary car. Seldom you can see it on the road nowadays. Year by year it is getting more and more difficult to maintain it because of lack of spare parts. Luckily my car is still running. It will be a great tribute to this car to say thank you for the service with one epic adventure. An epic car deserves an epic adventure for its anniversary birthday. The Opel turns 40 this year. It will be a way to say thank you to the engineers who put together such a remarkable piece of machinery. During the years when changing parts, I heard the comment from technicians repairing my vehicle ""Look how thoughtfully this is done!"" addressing a part of a key assembly.</p><p>My plan is again to go by road from Bulgaria to India, en route to drive on some spectacular roads in Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan. In India to attempt the route, Shimla, Spitti Valley and then Leh and Kardung La going back to Srinagar and back to the border with Pakistan. If there is time, the weather permits and the crew is well we can attempt the Karakoram highway on the way back. The product of the adventure will be a pool of photos and video footage featuring the car in all these locations. After returning I will put together a spectacular, fine-art, 200+ pages large format photo book and a short film documenting the adventure.</p><p>At the moment I am not able to finance a journey like this, let alone to buy or rent equipment in replacement of my stolen one, to document it. With my wife, we have two babies now to take care of and all our resources are centered there. I can see the idea happen only with community support, a community with a passion for machinery made to last.</p><p>So far I have only received compliments on that I still drive such a car on a regular basis. Some years ago, when stuck with problems which I was lucky enough to solve on the road other people were joking pointing out that the car deserves to be sent for scrap, my answer was that before it goes for scrap I will drive it to India. India is already an achieved goal, behind our back are also trips to Germany, France and one to Cyprus through Turkey and the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The wheels of the Opel rolled in Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Italy, France, Monaco, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, India, Cyprus. And with your help and my dedication I would be happy to drive and support the car to reach the highest motorable road in Ladakh.</p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>The funding will be spent to cover the following needs:</p><p>carnet de passage/insurance for the vehicle - 1000EUR will cover the price for the carnet and a security deposit to the Bulgarian Automobile Association and insurance with partial road assistance in Turkey;</p><p>visas and other entry permits - multi-entry visas are required for Iran and Pakistan and a single entry for India. Price per person - Iran - 150EUR, Pakistan - 100EUR, India - 50EUR. 600EUR needed for the driver and co-driver.</p><p>fuel and other consumables for the car. The car runs on LPG and Benzine. LPG is available in Bulgaria and Turkey. In Iran and Pakistan LPG is not available, on my last trip I could not manage to find any. In India, LPG is available at some locations. The car spends about 10l fuel per 100km. Price for fuel in Iran in 2016/2017 was 1/3 to Europe, in Pakistan 1/2 to Europe, in India and Turkey it is the same as in Europe.</p><p>Estimated approximate distance per country one way. This is the bare minimum to reach our goal:</p><p>Turkey - 1700 km;</p><p>Iran - 2500 km;</p><p>Pakistan 1700 km;</p><p>India 2200 km;</p><p>Regarding the price of fuel, we will drive 2500 at maybe 1/3 the regular price, 1700 km at 1/2 the regular price and 3900 km at the regular price. Calculated for the bare minimum distance of 8100 km one way we will need around 620EUR. We will need to maintain the car along the way changing oil, adding coolant, changing air filters, rotate or maybe change tires, pay for toll roads so let us have the minimum of 2000 EUR to reach our goal with minimum safety.</p><p>renting/buying camera equipment, tripods, and mounts. This section will need about 4000EUR to get a few lenses with a decent DSLR, a tripod, 360-degree camera with proper mounts and storage. From my former equipment, I have remaining Atomos Ninja Star HD recorder, Nikkor Ais 50mm f1.8 lens, Samyang 100mm f2.8 Nikon mount and Nikon FM2 with 10 rolls of expired slide film. A DSLR camera in the range of Fuji XT3, Nikon D750 capable to be connected to Atomos recorder costs above 1500EUR, add two more lenses, storage cards, backup storage, extra batteries, car battery charger with a battery bank and the price runs over 4000EUR;</p><p>unexpected - 1500EUR, if we need to abandon the trip, evacuate ourselves, do a major repair on the car, etc.</p><p>hotel/food - 1500EUR for the Opel crew will be sufficient to drive in limited comfort for the time span middle of July - middle of November.</p><p>Total the goal runs to 10600EUR. I have set the goal to 13001USD to cover the fees applied by Indiegogo, Indiegogo reserved funds, for a bank and currency transfers. If the goal is met and there is still funding, the money will be used on getting more equipment like a drone to film the car from the air, to fit the car with some spare parts, to cover more distance going to more locations. The fundraising is fixed because in my view I will not be able to accomplish it to the fullest with a flexible goal.</p><p>Because I really want the community to take part in this adventure I am offering you to join me. There are 7 PERKS offered to any of you willing to be part of the Opel adventure.  You hop aboard at an arranged in advance location. As an Opel crew member you can participate to spend valuable time together, by telling us stories, discussing, planning the route, navigating, building camps, preparing food, maintaining the car, do plenty of photographs, shoot video, or do anything which will not compromise the vehicle, the passengers safety, nor harm the environment nor the people around us, in general to be a good and trustworthy companion willing to give a hand when needed. We will be 3 persons in the car with you, space will be a bit cramped, but still not unbearable because we stop frequently visit places, hike, shoot photos and video or just enjoy a view. You will share our humble meals and I will provide with a tent when camping, the rest is on you. Each PERK is for the duration of crossing a country, which may take 10-15 days. If you are willing to join us for the whole trip you can get all the PERKS in one direction and join us for the whole distance hopping in and out any time you want.</p><p>“Take only photos and leave just the tracks of the vehicle behind” is our motto.</p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>Documenting a trip like this brings hundreds of technical challenges like adjusting the fuel mixture at high altitude or maneuvering the car at road conditions above the car capabilities. People also need to acclimatize to the altitude. For the section of the road Tabo - Valley - Keylong - Leh I have already acquired car drivers roaming in the area and all of them report the road as difficult but not impossible for a car like the Opel. Nevertheless, it will be a technical and human challenge to overcome all difficulties and successfully drive to the Kardungh La pass. It is a pure adventure to accomplish such an endeavor and documenting with photos and video footage the progress of the trip is a great tribute to the car manufacturers and engineers behind the Opel Rekord, to the car owners and to all people supporting this goal.</p><p>As we live in a consumer-oriented world where business competes on increased sales we are producing more and more unusable garbage. Driving with the 40 years old Opel I would like to bring up again the awareness to people to make things to last and save natural resources when planning to produce the next good for nothing contraption to sell to the public.</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>We will drive through some not quite secure countries in the Middle East, acquiring visas and permits to visit places may be hindered. The car is well maintained, but nevertheless we may experience a malfunction in the middle of nowhere, weather changes may deteriorate road conditions we must be prepared to abandon the vehicle or change the route or shorten the time of the trip or break the trip due to illness of the crew, irreparable problems with the vehicle, car accidents etc.</p><p>Health issues may arise, high altitude acclimatization is needed, roads are of a changing state in the mountains.</p><p>The car does not have airconditioner, but there is a working heater which will be very useful when the temperatures drop.</p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>If you live in any of the countries we will go through it will be great if you can offer us shelter, help us with clever planning the route telling us in advance of hidden obstacles, hang out with us, exchange stories, help us do a technical check up on the car, oil changes, any other maintenance we may require. You can donate us photography equipment, car navigating tools, camping gear, special tools for the car, just send us a message that you are there for us to help us.</p><p><br/> </p></div>","НакраткоЗа всички български поддръжници, става дума за пътешествие с поразклатен и поръждясал, но все още в перфектно движение Опел Рекорд, модел 1979 година до най-високите проходими за коли превали в света, които се намират в Ладах, Индия.Като говорим за пътешествия, аз имам две такива по суша в посока Индия.

I had an ambitious plan, to drive from Shimla to Tabo and Spiti Valley and then if still possible to bring the car to Leh and from there to go over Kardungh La at 5615m above sea level, to continue to Srinagar and from there back to Amritsar and the border with Pakistan. Unfortunately, my adventure was stolen along the way. One night in a small village in Rajasthan where I was camping, my car was broken into. Somebody broke the side window at the driver side while I was not attending the car and stole all my belongings. I have overtrusted the villagers as I usually do and they have taken advantage of stealing all my camera equipment, in the face of my beloved Nikon Df along with 5 lenses Nikkor Ais 28mm f2.8, Nikkor Ais 105mm f2.5, Nikkor Ai 80-200mm f4.5, Nikkor AF 50mm f1.8, Samyang 14mm f2.8, and a camcorder which I have borrowed from a Bulgarian TV Station, but the worst was that they have also found and stolen my wallet with my travel documents, so I have lost my passport and the adventure was killed just at its birth. I was fortunate enough to have my car papers intact.You may say I am stupid to leave my documents inside the car, but I can not break my perception to trust immensely people. When I am traveling I am roaming alone surrounded by people who have all the power to help me, to hinder my plans, to do anything with me. If I keep too much tension on what negative can happen it will eventually happen anticipating it, or I will live through it any second I am in a foreign land. My principle is to surrender and to embrace whatever life serves me. And life has plenty of surprises at hand. I was penniless and the people from the police department gathered money - a total of 7000 INR - 100 EUR, to help me with the travel expenses, to get with the car to Delhi to report at the embassy of my country. I was also released paying toll road tax with a special letter prepared by them. A heart-touching gesture of people with an immense heart.A week after the robbery, the police found and returned to me my driving license and the borrowed camcorder, the rest was never found.Next, I went through a tough process on acquiring a temporary passport stamped with all the necessary visas, which at one point seemed impossible to be done from inside India and I was very close to go back to Bulgaria by air just because of some ridiculous bureaucracy rules. Thanks to the help of some open-minded government officials of 3 different countries I was free to go limited only by the duration of my temporary passport which the Bulgarian government has issued to be valid for only 30 days from which 15 were lost on visas and the remaining 2 weeks were a hectic driving back home through 4 countries. A friend of mine Radoslav Kolev came to India after I had acquired all the needed documents and helped me drive the car back to Bulgaria. Here you can find pictures of the return trip taken by him on his phone - http://kolev.info/files/rekordtrip/MissionThe Opel Rekord is a legendary car. Seldom you can see it on the road nowadays. Year by year it is getting more and more difficult to maintain it because of lack of spare parts. Luckily my car is still running. It will be a great tribute to this car to say thank you for the service with one epic adventure. An epic car deserves an epic adventure for its anniversary birthday. The Opel turns 40 this year. It will be a way to say thank you to the engineers who put together such a remarkable piece of machinery. During the years when changing parts, I heard the comment from technicians repairing my vehicle ""Look how thoughtfully this is done!"" addressing a part of a key assembly.My plan is again to go by road from Bulgaria to India, en route to drive on some spectacular roads in Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan. In India to attempt the route, Shimla, Spitti Valley and then Leh and Kardung La going back to Srinagar and back to the border with Pakistan. If there is time, the weather permits and the crew is well we can attempt the Karakoram highway on the way back. The product of the adventure will be a pool of photos and video footage featuring the car in all these locations. After returning I will put together a spectacular, fine-art, 200+ pages large format photo book and a short film documenting the adventure.At the moment I am not able to finance a journey like this, let alone to buy or rent equipment in replacement of my stolen one, to document it. With my wife, we have two babies now to take care of and all our resources are centered there. I can see the idea happen only with community support, a community with a passion for machinery made to last.So far I have only received compliments on that I still drive such a car on a regular basis. Some years ago, when stuck with problems which I was lucky enough to solve on the road other people were joking pointing out that the car deserves to be sent for scrap, my answer was that before it goes for scrap I will drive it to India. India is already an achieved goal, behind our back are also trips to Germany, France and one to Cyprus through Turkey and the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The wheels of the Opel rolled in Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, Italy, France, Monaco, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, India, Cyprus. And with your help and my dedication I would be happy to drive and support the car to reach the highest motorable road in Ladakh.What We Need & What You GetThe funding will be spent to cover the following needs:carnet de passage/insurance for the vehicle - 1000EUR will cover the price for the carnet and a security deposit to the Bulgarian Automobile Association and insurance with partial road assistance in Turkey;visas and other entry permits - multi-entry visas are required for Iran and Pakistan and a single entry for India. Price per person - Iran - 150EUR, Pakistan - 100EUR, India - 50EUR. 600EUR needed for the driver and co-driver.fuel and other consumables for the car. The car runs on LPG and Benzine. LPG is available in Bulgaria and Turkey. In Iran and Pakistan LPG is not available, on my last trip I could not manage to find any. In India, LPG is available at some locations. The car spends about 10l fuel per 100km. Price for fuel in Iran in 2016/2017 was 1/3 to Europe, in Pakistan 1/2 to Europe, in India and Turkey it is the same as in Europe.Estimated approximate distance per country one way. This is the bare minimum to reach our goal:Turkey - 1700 km;Iran - 2500 km;Pakistan 1700 km;India 2200 km;Regarding the price of fuel, we will drive 2500 at maybe 1/3 the regular price, 1700 km at 1/2 the regular price and 3900 km at the regular price. Calculated for the bare minimum distance of 8100 km one way we will need around 620EUR. We will need to maintain the car along the way changing oil, adding coolant, changing air filters, rotate or maybe change tires, pay for toll roads so let us have the minimum of 2000 EUR to reach our goal with minimum safety.renting/buying camera equipment, tripods, and mounts. This section will need about 4000EUR to get a few lenses with a decent DSLR, a tripod, 360-degree camera with proper mounts and storage. From my former equipment, I have remaining Atomos Ninja Star HD recorder, Nikkor Ais 50mm f1.8 lens, Samyang 100mm f2.8 Nikon mount and Nikon FM2 with 10 rolls of expired slide film. A DSLR camera in the range of Fuji XT3, Nikon D750 capable to be connected to Atomos recorder costs above 1500EUR, add two more lenses, storage cards, backup storage, extra batteries, car battery charger with a battery bank and the price runs over 4000EUR;unexpected - 1500EUR, if we need to abandon the trip, evacuate ourselves, do a major repair on the car, etc.hotel/food - 1500EUR for the Opel crew will be sufficient to drive in limited comfort for the time span middle of July - middle of November.Total the goal runs to 10600EUR. I have set the goal to 13001USD to cover the fees applied by Indiegogo, Indiegogo reserved funds, for a bank and currency transfers. If the goal is met and there is still funding, the money will be used on getting more equipment like a drone to film the car from the air, to fit the car with some spare parts, to cover more distance going to more locations. The fundraising is fixed because in my view I will not be able to accomplish it to the fullest with a flexible goal.Because I really want the community to take part in this adventure I am offering you to join me. There are 7 PERKS offered to any of you willing to be part of the Opel adventure.  You hop aboard at an arranged in advance location. As an Opel crew member you can participate to spend valuable time together, by telling us stories, discussing, planning the route, navigating, building camps, preparing food, maintaining the car, do plenty of photographs, shoot video, or do anything which will not compromise the vehicle, the passengers safety, nor harm the environment nor the people around us, in general to be a good and trustworthy companion willing to give a hand when needed. We will be 3 persons in the car with you, space will be a bit cramped, but still not unbearable because we stop frequently visit places, hike, shoot photos and video or just enjoy a view. You will share our humble meals and I will provide with a tent when camping, the rest is on you. Each PERK is for the duration of crossing a country, which may take 10-15 days. If you are willing to join us for the whole trip you can get all the PERKS in one direction and join us for the whole distance hopping in and out any time you want.“Take only photos and leave just the tracks of the vehicle behind” is our motto.The ImpactDocumenting a trip like this brings hundreds of technical challenges like adjusting the fuel mixture at high altitude or maneuvering the car at road conditions above the car capabilities. People also need to acclimatize to the altitude. For the section of the road Tabo - Valley - Keylong - Leh I have already acquired car drivers roaming in the area and all of them report the road as difficult but not impossible for a car like the Opel. Nevertheless, it will be a technical and human challenge to overcome all difficulties and successfully drive to the Kardungh La pass. It is a pure adventure to accomplish such an endeavor and documenting with photos and video footage the progress of the trip is a great tribute to the car manufacturers and engineers behind the Opel Rekord, to the car owners and to all people supporting this goal.As we live in a consumer-oriented world where business competes on increased sales we are producing more and more unusable garbage. Driving with the 40 years old Opel I would like to bring up again the awareness to people to make things to last and save natural resources when planning to produce the next good for nothing contraption to sell to the public.Risks & ChallengesWe will drive through some not quite secure countries in the Middle East, acquiring visas and permits to visit places may be hindered. The car is well maintained, but nevertheless we may experience a malfunction in the middle of nowhere, weather changes may deteriorate road conditions we must be prepared to abandon the vehicle or change the route or shorten the time of the trip or break the trip due to illness of the crew, irreparable problems with the vehicle, car accidents etc.Health issues may arise, high altitude acclimatization is needed, roads are of a changing state in the mountains.The car does not have airconditioner, but there is a working heater which will be very useful when the temperatures drop.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you live in any of the countries we will go through it will be great if you can offer us shelter, help us with clever planning the route telling us in advance of hidden obstacles, hang out with us, exchange stories, help us do a technical check up on the car, oil changes, any other maintenance we may require. You can donate us photography equipment, car navigating tools, camping gear, special tools for the car, just send us a message that you are there for us to help us.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1>A bee problem</h1>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you just saw our video up there, this will sound familiar to you: <b>bees
are dying faster than they did before. And this is important because one of
three meals we eat is only possible because of bees, with great significance in
global economy and health.</b></p>
<p>There are problems with beekeeping
that one cannot control, like monocultures or pesticides. The so-called Colony
Collapse Disorder (CCD). But there are other challenges that beekeepers can
face. </p>

The problem is that <b>regular beekeeping is hard work</b>, and there’s no way to run from
that. It involves regular visits, unnecessary and disturbing inspections and a
time consuming logistic effort. Naturally combining the typical difficulties of
the bees (like winter or invaders) with the most recent ones (CCD), the result is
systematic losses for beekeepers.<br/><br/><i>Bees demand dedication, care
and all the love they deserve.</i>
</div>
<div>
<p>With <b>APiS Technology</b> we
can’t manage to save them all but we are seriously improving things.</p>
<p>Apis Technology was born from the
need to change things we find bee unfriendly. We saw many beekeepers making
mistakes that could be avoided with the use of harmless technology.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b><i>But that is about to change.</i></b></p>

<h3>A BEE-FRIENDLY APPROACH</h3>
<p>When we talk about technology it may seem scary for those who just want to keep things natural with the bees. Well, we want you to know that we get that.</p>
<p>Our team worked the last two years to create a way to bring a smart non-offensive hive and monitor technology. And we mean non-offensive in every way. We assure you that bees will not be affected by radiation or anything else that may disturb them. The idea is to make things better for them. <u>Never</u> the opposite.</p>
<p>Let’s cut to the chase.</p>
<p>First we must tell you that we did an intensive research to find the best materials to fit our hive and the best technics to improve our monitoring technology. The result is an apparently traditional beehive, but prettier, safer, more comfortable and mostly more efficient.</p>
<p><em>By keeping things natural (but better) for bees, this technology will change the way beekeeping goes.</em></p>

Apis Technology is the ultimate tool for professional, hobbyist and
scientist beekeepers. It was designed to improve the way beekeepers manage their
apiaries, the comfort and safety of the bees, and to provide feasible data to
your private devices. 
In the last two years, we worked like crazy and we are now good to go
straight to the pre-sale of the early units of Apis Technology products. This
is a unique opportunity for you to be one of the first to get it and be a
part of our cause.

A bee problem

If you just saw our video up there, this will sound familiar to you: bees
are dying faster than they did before. And this is important because one of
three meals we eat is only possible because of bees, with great significance in
global economy and health.
There are problems with beekeeping
that one cannot control, like monocultures or pesticides. The so-called Colony
Collapse Disorder (CCD). But there are other challenges that beekeepers can
face. 

The problem is that regular beekeeping is hard work, and there’s no way to run from
that. It involves regular visits, unnecessary and disturbing inspections and a
time consuming logistic effort. Naturally combining the typical difficulties of
the bees (like winter or invaders) with the most recent ones (CCD), the result is
systematic losses for beekeepers.Bees demand dedication, care
and all the love they deserve.


With APiS Technology we
can’t manage to save them all but we are seriously improving things.
Apis Technology was born from the
need to change things we find bee unfriendly. We saw many beekeepers making
mistakes that could be avoided with the use of harmless technology.
But that is about to change.

APiS Monitoring System




Apis monitoring system is beekeepers’ best friend
Suitable to any beehive
Tracks bees’ activity in real time

Are bees foraging? Are they
producing? Is there anything wrong with one of my apiaries or beehives? Apis Monitoring System automatically analyzes everything for you.This way you can reduce and
manage the visits to each apiary, making it easier to you and much more
peaceful to the bees. All the beekeeper has to do is to check the computer,
smartphone or tablet. Your bees are just one quick click away.









If something goes wrong with
your girls, you receive an immediate notification
You can be sure that your bees are safe


Features 





Apis monitoring system analyzes the state of your colony and sends all the information to the platform, sending you a personal notification in case of alarm. Example: your new queen just started laying. You will get a notification to party hard.More:
You can monitor the hive performance. With Apis Technology we are able to check the honey production of the colony, with aggregate or individual readings, assess the production of honey even before the harvest or check the working level of bees each day.
You’ll be able to control threats. We obviously can’t avoid big animals next to the hives or parasites taking care of our bees, but we can predict something bad is happening and send an immediate notification so the beekeeper can protect the girls.





HOW TO USE IT

needs to be connected to the internet. This network mechanism allows you to
place all your hive monitors the way you want, and shift them, without a
problem. Truly a masterpiece.
The
only thing you have to do is to bolt or place it at the center of the apiary.
As simple as that.
Hive MonitorThe Hive Monitor is the brain
of each beehive. This module reads everything about what happens inside the
beehive with the swarm, like knowing if the queen is laying, assess if the
temperature is comfortable and if the level of humidity is between the sanity
levels.

The
Hive Monitor Module was designed to be as scalable as possible. This means that
our goal was to make this product affordable to every beekeeper and handy
enough to be easily placed inside the beehive without any effort.

Our team worked the last two years to create a way to bring a smart non-offensive hive and monitor technology. And we mean non-offensive in every way. We assure you that bees will not be affected by radiation or anything else that may disturb them. The idea is to make things better for them. Never the opposite.
Let’s cut to the chase.
First we must tell you that we did an intensive research to find the best materials to fit our hive and the best technics to improve our monitoring technology. The result is an apparently traditional beehive, but prettier, safer, more comfortable and mostly more efficient.
By keeping things natural (but better) for bees, this technology will change the way beekeeping goes.

Timeline



Team
We are beekeepers, engineers,
designers, managers, sons and boyfriends, but above all we are bee lovers.






We need you


We chose to sell the first
units of APiS technology products through a crowdfunding campaign, so we can produce
our products at an industrial scale and read all your suggestions to turn
this into a disruptive system.
Your contribution will help us
to:
- 
Fine tune
the hardware to make the products cheaper
- 
Launch the
pre-series and obtain the regulatory approvals
- 
Start the
manufacturing process


Risk & Challenges
We
are committed to bring you the finest products, and won't settle for anything
less. We will work closely with our manufacturing partners to ensure that the APiS
products come in perfect form and function in a timely manner.
Please be aware that we are constantly trying to improve our products so the final version can be slightly different than the one being presented.
We are dedicated to our project timeline and will
keep you informed on the status of our progress on a regular basis. Thank you so
much for all your support and contributions.


Frequently Asked Questions




How many products does APiS have? Do I
need to purchase all of them?
APiS Technology’s product line
consists of a beehive and a hive monitoring system. If we put the hive and the hive monitoring system together we get our Smart Hive. You can purchase the hive, the hive monitoring system
or both. The hive monitoring system needs a Hive Monitor and a Communication Module and
they heavily depend on each other. Then
you can add a bee counter and a scale, they are optional.
What is an APiS Hive?
An APiS Hive is a langstroth beehive
that is thermally more efficient then the common ones.
For whom is the Hive Monitoring System for?
The Hive Monitoring system is a tool for every professional,
hobbyist or scientist beekeeper.
Can I apply the APiS Monitoring System
into my current beehives?
Yes. We want this to be as affordable as
possible so we have designed it so you can use it in your current beehives, whatever
the kind their kind. However, if you use an APiS beehive, you will have some
sensors already installed in it.
Do the APiS Monitoring System disturb the bees?
Not in any way. The life of the bees stays untouchable. We will even prevent
some inspections, which helps to not disturb the girls.
Can I inspect the hive without turning
the APiS Monitoring System off?
Yes. You can inspect a hive like you
always did. You just have to take out the temperature probe when you're
inspecting the brood box and put it in again when the inspection is over. No
harm for any one.
How many should I buy if I have multiple apiaries?
You should buy at least one Communication Module per
apiary and one Hive Monitor per hive that you want to monitor.
If I don't have GSM network at my
apiary, can I use the Hive Monitoring System?
Yes. If you don't have GSM network at your apiary, the Hive Monitoring System can record all the data in a SD card and you can download it
to the APiS platform after.
When can I buy one?
You can pre-order at Indiegogo
starting September 7th, 2015.
How is it powered?
The APiS Hive Monitor is powered by 2 AA
batteries and the APiS Communication Module is powered by 4 AA batteries. The Scale and the
bee counter are connected to the hive monitor. The batteries are not included.
How long will the battery last?
Our first tests point to around 2-3 months. But we are constantly trying to improve our systems.

What kind of SIM card can I use with the monitoring system?
You can use whatever SIM card you want as long as it has a data plan for internet. The SIM card is not included.

Is the shipping
cost included?
The shipping cost will be
added at check-out based on the shipping destination.
Does it come with tech
support?
For tech support, please email
info@apistech.eu.

When do you ship?
In early 2016 (targeting April).

Can I get a refund?
Pre-orders are not refundable.

<h2>Using the unit.</h2>
<p><b>1) </b>These units are designed to be used when dusting, sweeping and brooming your home/office. Put it on and let it run for 3-4 hours. </p>
<p>Note: Brooming only removes the bigger visible particles and unfortunately also lifts &amp; spreads the fine thin dust into the air-space which stays back hanging in the air while you are breathing it in, thinking your room has been cleaned. Later within 24 hours it has settles back on things all around you. By disturbing it you only make it easy for the dust to enter your breathing system. Trap it before it hurts you. Where cross-ventilation is lacking, the importance of the unit grows exponentially. After that if used with care the unit should last you for a long time.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>2)</b> FILTER PADS and their Maintenance</p>
<p>Very important. Keep an eye on the filter pad. If it looks dirty clean it as per instructions</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Remove the filter by opening the top, then wash it and replace it along the same lines back into place.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b>3)</b> For disinfecting the room, pure camphor or any camphorated balm, petroleum jelly based can be used and for fragrance, any essential oil, oil based perfume will do too.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><b>How long will it take for Safe Air to be delivered?</b></p>
<p>-We expect to finish delivering Safe Air to our supporters by the end of September 2016. We will distribute our products from Delhi, India.</p>
<p><b>We need extra filters. How will that work? How long can the filter last?</b></p>
<p>We will provide with extra filters and with washing and reuse the original pack should last you a long time. More can be ordered from us. Sent by post easily.</p>
<p><b>Do you deliver beyond India?</b></p>
<p>Yes, we can. All we need is just a little extra shipping cost. Please message us at <b>namastesafeair@gmail.com</b> directly if you want to order outside the India.</p>
<p><b>I like the design, the video demonstration, and everything, but can Safe Air really work great?</b></p>
<p>We have spent months, day in and day out, in our lab to carefully design, model, and test Safe Air. You will not find any similar product that has the same set of functions as Safe Air. You will witness the effect of our product not only by numbers or data, but also from the breath that you take every second in your office or at home. If you do not like our product, we will be happy to refund 100% of the cost.<br/><br/><b>What about Ionisers and Ozone?</b></p>
<p><b>IONISERS</b> only help the dust to settle down. This is not required in Safe-Air.</p>
<p><b>Ozone is used for disinfection. </b>Too much ozone is hazardous to health. Camphorating is better.<br/><br/></p>
<p><b>THE ANSWER IS IN REMOVING THE OFFENDING PARTICULATE MATTER!</b></p>

1) These units are designed to be used when dusting, sweeping and brooming your home/office. Put it on and let it run for 3-4 hours. 
Note: Brooming only removes the bigger visible particles and unfortunately also lifts & spreads the fine thin dust into the air-space which stays back hanging in the air while you are breathing it in, thinking your room has been cleaned. Later within 24 hours it has settles back on things all around you. By disturbing it you only make it easy for the dust to enter your breathing system. Trap it before it hurts you. Where cross-ventilation is lacking, the importance of the unit grows exponentially. After that if used with care the unit should last you for a long time.

2) FILTER PADS and their Maintenance
Very important. Keep an eye on the filter pad. If it looks dirty clean it as per instructions

Remove the filter by opening the top, then wash it and replace it along the same lines back into place.



3) For disinfecting the room, pure camphor or any camphorated balm, petroleum jelly based can be used and for fragrance, any essential oil, oil based perfume will do too.

Yes, we can. All we need is just a little extra shipping cost. Please message us at namastesafeair@gmail.com directly if you want to order outside the India.
I like the design, the video demonstration, and everything, but can Safe Air really work great?
We have spent months, day in and day out, in our lab to carefully design, model, and test Safe Air. You will not find any similar product that has the same set of functions as Safe Air. You will witness the effect of our product not only by numbers or data, but also from the breath that you take every second in your office or at home. If you do not like our product, we will be happy to refund 100% of the cost.What about Ionisers and Ozone?
IONISERS only help the dust to settle down. This is not required in Safe-Air.
Ozone is used for disinfection. Too much ozone is hazardous to health. Camphorating is better.
THE ANSWER IS IN REMOVING THE OFFENDING PARTICULATE MATTER!

<h3>The Sunderbans</h3>
<p>The Sundarbans mangrove forest, one of the largest such forests in the world (140,000 ha), lies on the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers on the Bay of Bengal. It is adjacent to the border of India’s Sundarbans World Heritage site inscribed in 1987. The site is intersected by a complex network of tidal waterways, mudflats and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests, and presents an excellent example of ongoing ecological processes. The area is known for its wide range of fauna, including 260 bird species, the Bengal tiger and other threatened species such as the estuarine crocodile and the Indian python. </p>
<p>The Sundarbans is very vulnerable to a variety of anthropogenic activity, including intensive boating and fishing, dredging, tourism and port activities, operation of mechanized boats, excavation of sand from the riverbed, and the establishment of coal power plants.There are a number of endangered species in the Sundarbans, including two river dolphins and an endemic bird, the masked finfoot, which are even more at risk because of these environmental threats.

We will be raffling this awesome e-bike regardless of the number of tickets sold.  But we hope to sell all 200.

Key objectives in brief
Purchase the Isle of TaneraMor
Restore the ruined buildings to provide additional accommodation 
Weatherproof the 'Herring Station' 
Continue the tree planting programme across the island
Modernise the islands energy supplies to be fully renewable and sustainable
Build an education infrastructure for traditional arts, crafts and techniques
In more detail...The nine cottages on the Isle are rented out during the holiday season (April-September) and can be used as a base for a relaxing holiday.Courses are run on the island to teach people all manner of skills and crafts and we would like to expand the courses offered.
There are several ruins of cottages on the island which could be restored in the style of a traditional 'Crofters' cottage. The two room design consisting of a bedroom and a living space is not large but would allow the occupants to sample traditional accommodation first hand. A roof covered with turf in the traditional manner gives excellent insulation and protection against storms. These would make ideal accommodation for one or two people who are looking for a tranquil escape, or for them to take part in one of the courses run on the island .The old 'Herring Station' would have a roof fitted to make it into a large covered area from which we could run a Boat Building Academy, like this one in Lyme Regis (http://www.boatbuildingacademy.com/). Teaching people how to build traditional wooden crafts is an important way to keep the traditions alive as well as teaching them valuable skills. We will run short and long-term courses with recognized qualifications at the end. We want to glaze part of the roof and use the space underneath as a greenhouse and grow non-hardy plants such as tomatoes and peppers. There are many other ideas we have to turn the island into a cultural education center and they will take time and money to implement them.About meMy name is Paul Wyman and for many years I have had a passion to live in the Scottish Isles. When I saw Tanera Mor was for sale I spent a lot of time daydreaming about what I could do if I owned it, but short of winning the lottery there would be no way to realize my dreams. My other passion is gardening and vegetable growing and to become self sufficient by growing all my own food.  I have run the Gardeners Calendar website as a resource to help people learn to grow their own food. My only opportunity to realize these dreams would be to 'crowdfund' the money to buy Tanera Mor and then combine my passions.

The competition will be designed and run once the island is purchased.There is a plan to install a high definition camera overlooking the plots of land and it will be controlled via a webpage so you can see what the weather is like at anytime, and you can watch the 'aurora borealis' on clear nights.What if we don't reach the full £2.5 million?Whilst we would like to buy the Isle as a whole Tanera Mor is being sold off in three lots priced at £430,000, £700,000 and £820,000 so we can buy part of it if we don't reach the full figure.Please help us reach our goal by forwarding the campaign link to as many people as possible. Thank you",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Our end goal is for MAGARU to be accessible to all homes, so that we can increase the quality and sustainability in an average household.</p>

<p>In order to do all this we need to manufacture our first collection and find people that like MAGARU. But that’s just the beginning. </p>

</div></div>","Like paper to create origami, we have created furniture with the folds of a single sheet of steel. We are joining the circular economy way of designing and producing, by creating strong sustainable pieces of furniture that can be manufactured locally. A tribute to the practicality of a simple, intelligent design. All of the MAGARU pieces are made of steel. A strong, sustainable material folded into the best simple shapes in order to avoid weak points. Designed to be adaptable, thanks to its delicate lines and minimal design. Each piece is available in 5 different colours.   Still is considered one of the most sustainable materials, is 100% recyclable and 75% of the steel produced in Spain is already recycled.

We like to support independent manufacturers and save the planet of unnecessary shipping. Also our designs can be made from anywhere with the right facilities and it is more efficient financially, so everyone wins. This is why, as we grow, we will make sure we find other partners around the world, so we can support your local economy as well as ours.
 

 

 



 

 
We are a group of designers and makers that got chatting about the fact that we couldn't afford the pieces we were making for our clients. We love what we do and the way we do it, this is why we wanted to start a new brand that becomes a realistic alternative for people like us: Quality furniture that we don't need to replace, made with a sustainable material and affordable to most people. We have done this thanks to an efficient design and optimising resources that reduce the manufacturing costs.

 


 

 
All the MAGARU pieces are manufactured using laser cut and bending the steel. Back in our workshop we give the final touches, like softening sharp edges or removing any imperfections. This allows us to quality check each piece before sending it to paint.
 

 

 
We have used all the pieces in our offices and homes. We have tested them in extreme circunstances to make sure you can enjoy each MAGARU piece safely.

<p>The inception of Project Eco Earth can be traced back to when we were walking through one of the famous nature trails of Uttarakhand, India. We identified the problem of how those areas are not at all able to manage the plastic being generated by the tourists. Almost all the plastic waste is either disposed of in drains or is burnt away. We went on to other trails and found large heaps of plastics being dumped in every corner of the mountains.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The issues revolving around plastic waste have long been acknowledged. However, the efforts made to combat it have been minimal. While the rates of plastic consumption are rising alarmingly, developments in its waste management have not picked up. It is well known that once introduced into the environment, plastic is capable of staying in the system for over 500 years. Before degrading entirely, plastic disintegrates into tiny particles that have hazardous impacts. According to UN estimates India generates about 25,940  tons of plastic waste per day (TPD) if we talk particularly in the tourism circuits of Uttarakhand the number. Even when statistics state that India recycles 10% of its plastic, a major chunk of plastic waste in the oceans comes from India. Tourism is one of the fastest growing industries in our country. More tourists equal more waste, and more waste inevitably translates into a larger environmental footprint. This is not just a problem for the areas where establishing an efficient waste management system is challenging, like small islands or remote, sparsely populated areas. Even major tourist sites fail to pay heed to this alarming issue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This plastic waste is capable of traveling hundreds of kilometers, getting lodged into the ecosystem, leeching out chemicals that affect every possible life form. Many studies have investigated the potential uptake of hydrophobic contaminants emerging from mismanaged plastic waste, which then get bioaccumulated in the food chain. Plastic is made using toxic additives like BPA, BPS, and Phthalates which can easily dissolve out into whatever material is kept inside it. Scientists have studied and illustrated how this can serious health defects like thyroid, mental breakdown, bad stomach, cell disruptions, DNA mutation and even higher stages of cancer. The harmful chemicals like PCBs, DDT, and PAH, which get absorbed in the plastic debris that floats in the sea water, have a varied and harmful range of chronic effects like endocrine disorders. The plastic that flows out in water bodies gets ingested by marine life forms exposing them to dangers of either poisoning or choking. Besides this, waste dump sites attract animals which feed on the easily available food waste and in the process, ingest the plastic interspersed with it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A lot of single-use plastic is thrown in the tourism circuits and due to lack of resources and ideas on how to deal with it, therefore, it either ends up in the rivers, chokes nallahs, litter around the trails or just lies somewhere in the corner of the mountains. Project Eco Earth is an environment-friendly solution to tackle the plastic problem around the globe by introducing easy to handle portable and efficient machines to up-cycle plastic and develop products which can be used for a long duration. As previously stated, we are going to develop a set of four machines namely Shredder, Extrusion, Injector, and Compressor. The shredded plastic flakes go into the extrusion machine to create threads of plastic which directly can be used to make door handles, vases, baskets, etc. Similarly, the injector gives out the melted plastic directly inside small molds to make small products like wall tiles. The compressor is a device which comes in the picture when we need to create big products like chairs, buckets, sheets, bricks, etc.</p>
<p><strong>The main Goals and Objectives of this project, therefore, are -</strong></p>
<p>• Reduce Plastic in the urban and rural landfills, mainly starting with tourist hotspots</p>
<p>• Create sustainable material from the plastic waste collected</p>
<p>• Promote DIY machines to set micro entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>• Create employment</p>
<p>The Machines are uniquely designed by our team throughout the globe to fit in a small workspace in order to be easy to handle, maintain and deliver the most efficient outcomes, before starting with the machine handling it should be very clear of what type of plastic we are going to deal with and whether it is pre segregated or not so that we can keep the products categorically as every category of plastic melts at a different temperature and if not understood properly can cause serious damage to the machine as well as will degrade the quality of the outcome.</p>
<p>The Shredder is designed in such a way that it can shred even the hardest plastic with a motor of 3Hp and 70 RPM, it goes slow and steady and gives equal pressure at every blade to a perfect same sized flakes of plastic the pain is to get used to segregate plastic categorically and use only one at a time the idea is to keep all the categories segregated so that in future the products can again be recycled and keep up the vicious circle.</p>
<p>Now these flakes enters the Extrusion machine where these shredded plastic flakes takes a new shape all together the machine is basically a heating tube with a 1.5 Hp motor connected at 60-70 RPM .once the temperature reaches the melting point of a particular category of plastic ,the flakes of the same categories goes inside the machine and keeps throwing a thread of the same material which either can be rolled in a thread form, or cut continuously at an interval to get pallets of the category which can be used as a secondary virgin material and molded into other shapes and forms . This machine is also capable of creating rod-like the structure of various shapes and castes you want to and have a nozzle to decide what shape coming out of the tube and of course the dimension of it.</p>
<p>These pallets now can be used to put into the third machine i.e. Injection machine which is small similar heating tube machine as that of the Extrusion but doesn’t have a motor (its manual) and also is standing vertical, pointing downwards which once preheated to a certain temperature it intakes the pallets into its semi funnel fitted in the rod and goes straight into the tube, a mould is already fixed in the nozzle and is waiting to be injected, the melted plastic then pushed and pooped into the cast to take desired shapes. This machine can process only a limited quantity and that is the reason why we can only make small products out of this machine and for big products we use a compressor.</p>
<p>The Compressor creates products like baskets, tubs, vases, big tiles etc. The machine is a uniquely finished design which is fitted with an oven at the top of it with a small circular hole at the floor of the oven and a solid 5mm steel sheet at the ceiling inside, once a cast of product filled with flakes/ pallets enters into the oven chamber its is pushed from below wising a mechanical jack manually and given the shape provided the oven was preheated and was set to a temperature already.</p>
<p>All the machines are equipped with temperature controllers where heating takes place and speed regulator where the motor runs sometimes both using PID controllers and latest temperature regulators, in the shredder there exists a controller device which sometimes allows the motor to automatically reverse the shredding if stuck with a thick plastic piece.</p>

</div></div>","The inception of Project Eco Earth can be traced back to when we were walking through one of the famous nature trails of Uttarakhand, India. We identified the problem of how those areas are not at all able to manage the plastic being generated by the tourists. Almost all the plastic waste is either disposed of in drains or is burnt away. We went on to other trails and found large heaps of plastics being dumped in every corner of the mountains.
 
The issues revolving around plastic waste have long been acknowledged. However, the efforts made to combat it have been minimal. While the rates of plastic consumption are rising alarmingly, developments in its waste management have not picked up. It is well known that once introduced into the environment, plastic is capable of staying in the system for over 500 years. Before degrading entirely, plastic disintegrates into tiny particles that have hazardous impacts. According to UN estimates India generates about 25,940  tons of plastic waste per day (TPD) if we talk particularly in the tourism circuits of Uttarakhand the number. Even when statistics state that India recycles 10% of its plastic, a major chunk of plastic waste in the oceans comes from India. Tourism is one of the fastest growing industries in our country. More tourists equal more waste, and more waste inevitably translates into a larger environmental footprint. This is not just a problem for the areas where establishing an efficient waste management system is challenging, like small islands or remote, sparsely populated areas. Even major tourist sites fail to pay heed to this alarming issue.
 
This plastic waste is capable of traveling hundreds of kilometers, getting lodged into the ecosystem, leeching out chemicals that affect every possible life form.

get a taste of the Green way of life.<br/><br/>Part of that commitment
is the use of solar and wind power to meet our energy needs. 
We have vacuum tube solar panels that supply much of our guests' hot
water needs and until recently a 1.5 kw wind turbine provided as much
as half our electricity.<br/><br/>In the last twelve months the West of
Ireland has been lashed by some incredibly ferocious storms and our
windmill was seriously damaged.  Blades were shattered and the generating hub/turbine was destroyed.  When we came to do the assessment of what was needed we also discovered that the storage batteries, probably the biggest cost in the whole system, also need to be replaced  We are looking to repair the
windmill and upgrade the battery storage. We need all the help we
can get!</p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get.</h3>To complete the proposed repair we need €6000: 
	

<ol>
<li>New upgraded batteries for storage - €3000</li>

<h3>The Impact.</h3>
<p>Contributing to our project will mean much more than just
repairing the wind turbine hardware.</p>
<p>One of our key goals here at Crann Og is to educate people about
the benefits of sustainable energy production, to inform them of the

<h3>The Sh*t Show Summary</h3>
<p>We are a team of climbers and adventures and poop pun fanatics, passionate about protecting our favorite mountain destinations. In our combined years of being in wild places around the world, we have been stunned and disappointed by how poorly our poopoo is being managed in these sacred sites. </p>
<p>Seeing these mountains of crap around our beloved peaks has made us ask what we can do about it (besides being personally equipped pooper scoopers). And the solution we came up with? Starting a non-profit dedicated to solving these waste management problems in the great outdoors: DO GOOD SHIT. </p>
<p>We teamed up with Toilet Tech Solutions and their leading Poop Professor, Geoff Hill (the guy has a PhD in this crap). He filled us in on all of his toilet technology and his idea of where a good place to launch this project would be: Torres del Paine National Park, Chile. </p>
<p>By supporting this project, you will be contributing to the installation of three tech toilets within the park. Help us make sure that this magical destination keeps its shit together, instead of having it strewn along its winding trails. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Need For Toilets &amp; Paper </h3>
<p>Torres del Paine National Park receives over 250,000 visitors per year, with an annual increase in visitation of almost 10%. And all of those visitors, they don't just take pretty pictures and hike around. They POOP. A LOT. Which makes the need for toilet infrastructure an obvious and timely issue. </p>
<p>The Torres del Paine Legacy Fund already has a chunk of this project funded. However, we currently still face a $10,000 funding gap. </p>
<p>*The paper breakdown $$$ : </p>
<p>Toilet stalls (with recycled plastic T&amp;G lumber) : $6,300</p>
<p>Structural floors : $1,500</p>
<p>Decomposing vaults : $2,200</p>
<p>Total: $10,000</p>
<p>-Our goal is to get this project funded and the toilets installed as soon as the weather window opens in late November/early December 2019 (Southern Hemisphere guys). Our team will be traveling down to perform the installation in cooperation with Dr. Geoff Hill and volunteers. </p>
<p>*Donations to this campaign will go to our partner non-profit, Lewis &amp; Clark College, which consistently ranks as one of the nations top colleges in terms of environmental responsibility and sustainability by the Sierra Club and the Princeton Review. Lewis &amp; Clark will spend 100% of the proceeds on the project costs described above.*</p>
<h3>The Toilet Tech</h3>
<p>We will be installing Toilet Tech Solutions' genius waste-diverting toilets. Basically, these backcountry poop units divert urine away from solid waste (we're the only mammals that actually do these businesses in the same place) so that it can be efficiently broken down by native soil invertebrates and bacteria. </p>
<p>These toilets demand no pumping of smelly vaults, no nasty port-a-potties, no slinging barrels, none of that icky - just a simple annual maintenance of about 2 hours. </p>
<p>TTS has already installed 160 toilets in 9 different countries/states at more than 1,000,000 toilet uses per year. These projects are already out there working. And we want to take it down to Torres.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Shit Risks </h3>
<p>We know that cleaning up this shit won't be easy. Luckily, the TTS/DGS/Legacy Fund is on top of it. Some foreseeable issues and solutions: </p>
<p>*Site assessment and installation planning: these initial stages have been underway for nearly 3 years now. Obstacles including compliance and permitting, toilet use loads, waste disposal strategy, soil and site analysis have been examined and overcome. </p>
<p>*Logistics: high mountain installations are labor intensive and weather dependent. That's why we are waiting for the weather to clear in Nov/Dec. There are a lot of variables here including shipping delays and toilet transport hiccups. However, the toilets have already been ordered for manufacture and we are prepared to be on the ground coordinating all of these logistics. </p>
<p>*Proper implementation: site preparation, excavation, construction, unit installation. The founder of TTS himself, Geoff Hill, will be accompanying the DGS team down to make sure that this implementation process goes smoothly. He's installed toilets as high up as 10,000' at Mount Rainier's Camp Muir. He knows what he is doing and will be able to adequately train our team for endless installations to come. </p>
<p>We've got our sh*t dialed - help us make this project a reality! </p>

<h3>Nourish to Flourish</h3>
<p>Flourish Foods started as a tiny idea way back in December 2017 - I'd come home from living in the US where buying in bulk from hoppers was fairly standard for dry foods, and I was trying really hard to reduce our waste even further.  We had an under-1 year old and already did as much as possible with reuseables and non-consumables, yet had this content battle with plastic food packaging.  </p>
<p>I asked on Facebook on 31st December 2017 ""is there such a thing as a food weigh house anymore?""</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528716336/ngk2girri9qy7pbddp0y.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I expected that as I live in a big, progressive, city, this would absolutely exist and amending our shopping habits slightly would be such an easy win for us ... the response was less than resounding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528716384/bvutxcmpb55otmcwjdws.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>23 weeks ago I began this journey with a baby, a full-time job and not enough free time to sleep never mind build a brand, but I started working on it anyway - and now, here we are at the final junction before opening and the response from people in Manchester has been overwhelming!</p>
<p>It's the final hurdle and I can't think of any better way to cross the finish line than alongside, and in collaboration with, all the wonderful people who have followed Flourish on this journey.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Plastic Activist and why so Drastic?</h3>
<p>Plastic is a useful material, we can't deny it.  It's fairly cheap to mass produce, it's durable and it's accessible.  It is unlikely we will ever do away with all plastics, however, single use plastics, pitched as ""disposable"" are literally changing our planet, and not for the better.  Plastics have infiltrated rock formations (<a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/06/rocks-made-plastic-found-hawaiian-beach"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/06/rocks-ma...</a>), appeared in the food chain (<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/14/sea-to-plate-plastic-got-into-fish"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/f...</a>) and of course the now all too familiar narrative of trash in our oceans.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528793332/s1vdlp1ut3liiyee7khn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In March this year the devastating news came to Manchester, here, in our beautiful city, we're home to the Riverbed that has the largest number of plastic particles; at 517,000 plastic particles per square meter the River Tame was found to have double the number of micro plastics of any other previously recorded waterway, higher than the beaches off South Korea (<a href=""https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/river-tame-plastic-pollution-microbeads-14407335"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/gr...</a>).  Something in our city has to change.</p>
<p>The global statistics are frightening;</p>
<ul>
<li>15 million tonnes of plastic were produced in 1964, by 2014 this figure had risen to 311 million tonnes a figure set to double in the next 20 years.  Single use plastic packaging made up 26% of this figure - that's about 81 million tonnes in 2014; (<a href=""https://newplasticseconomy.org/assets/doc/EllenMacArthurFoundation_TheNewPlasticsEconomy_Pages.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://newplasticseconomy.org/assets/doc/Ellen...</a>);</li>
<li>Greenpeace estimate that 12.7 million tonnes of plastic end up in the ocean each year (<a href=""https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/what-we-do/oceans/plastics/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/what-we-do/oceans...</a>);</li>
<li>The UN ""State of Plastics"" report notes that <p><i>""The most common single-use plastics found in the environment are, in order of magnitude, cigarette butts, plastic drinking bottles, plastic bottle caps, food wrappers, plastic grocery bags, plastic lids, straws and stirrers, other types of plastic bags, and foam take-away containers. These are the waste products of a throwaway culture that treats plastic as a disposable material rather than a valuable resource to be harnessed""  </i>(<a href=""https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/25513/state_plastics_WED.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500...</a>) and goes onto suggest that 50% of plastic WASTE generated in 2015 was packaging (<a href=""https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/25496/singleUsePlastic_sustainability.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500...</a>).</p>

</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528793408/zzmwrj0vaim71btxbk3x.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It's really important we start to realise that there is no ""thrown away"" for plastics, and single use plastics are causing a global epidemic where in 2009 there was a measured 6 x more plastic in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre than Plankton (<a href=""https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/5208645/Drowning-in-plastic-The-Great-Pacific-Garbage-Patch-is-twice-the-size-of-France.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environm...</a>).  </p>
<p>Plastics do not corrode, or breakdown, they only photodegrade, which means they break down into smaller and smaller pieces (which we now know as micro plastics) but never back to their base components in the same way that metal does for example.  Although a plastic bottle can be recycled, it can never be a plastic bottle again in the same way that a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again, as plastic degrades each time it is recycled.  Refuse first; reduce, reuse and recycle second.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528793377/x6yebo4ooitahqgixois.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>We have an opportunity here in Manchester to show that, once again, we're a city of ideas, we're a city of change, we're a city of innovation, of community and we don't shy away from new ideas and new ways of doing things.  Lets do it for our city, for our waterways and for our world.</strong></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Up to now I have self-funded Flourish including up front rent, marketing, training programmes, website builds, samples and mailboxes.  I have used time off work, and reduced hours which have impacted my salary to get us to where we are now.  But, it isn't enough to get us open.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528798057/hijt79imwro4nj5z73qo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our opening figure is low, £6,600.  If we reach our goal we will actually receive £6,270 as Indiegogo charges a 5% fee of monies raised.  </p>
<p>Of that £6,270 we will also be charged a 0.30p transaction fee every time a card is used to fund us PLUS 3% of the amount pledged on that card by Stripe (so for a £10.00 pledge we will receive £9.40, a £20 pledge we will receive £19.10, a £40.00 we will receive £38.50 and so on before loosing 5% to Indigogo).  We will also need to pay VAT on any funding pledges that carry a physical reward and we will have to pay a one time fee of £25.00 to have pledges transferred to us from Indiegogo.  After fees, and charges we should be left with circa. £6,000.</p>
<p>The campaign will pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Till System </li>
<li>Scales </li>
<li>Mobile Handwash System </li>
<li>Initial Orders </li>
<li>Stock Storage </li>
<li>Shop Fittings </li>
</ul>
<p>If we smash the target then we will buy in the following as levels allow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Terracycle boxes - We will have basic Teracycle anyway but the mixed stream Terracycle boxes are quite expensive but we will buy them in for the launch if funding allows.  These boxes will allow you to bring your hard to recycle items from home and recycle them with us to raise money for local charities;</li>
<li>Nutrimilk Machine - This is the machine that will allow us to make nut and oat milks freshly while you wait.  It also makes nut butter in small quantities;</li>
<li>Nut Butter Machine - the large self-serve but butter grinders are very expensive and usually require importing so if we totally smash the target we will work towards getting one of these in at Flourish too.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>I know everyone has been dying to know what the perks are and we made a decision to keep things simple - we flirted with a complex campaign, with many levels of, and types of reward; but, every time we costed it , it came out the same - we'd need a lot more in the funding pot to buy the rewards, to give to you, to thank you for funding us, which meant charging you more for a bag, or a jar, or whatever - we thought you'd just prefer a useful perk that cost less - so we decided to give out something we can do for free, that benefits you, <u><strong>and will never be available again.</strong></u>  Because we also know that some of our non-food items are popular we will be running a pre-order system for them, which will be launched separately to the crowdfunding campaign.</p>

<h3>The Impact of your Contribution</h3>
<p>We're running a Fixed-Funding campaign; what that essentially means is that we either reach our goal and get funded, or, we don't.  We've chosen this approach to the campaign to protect you, our customers, as, if we don't reach the goal we can't feasibly open and stock Flourish anyway.  We're aiming for the smallest amount possible to get started, and anything less just wouldn't cut the mustard (seeds).  If we fail, then everyone who has pledged to get us open will be refunded in full.  It's riskier for us, but I feel more comfortable knowing that you are protected. </p>
<p>You contribution will have a direct, and measurable, impact on plastic use within the Greater Manchester area.  We will be tracking and publishing the volume of plastic saved on our website in (almost) real time so not only will you be able to see what we have created and saved together as a whole, but what your specific purchases contribute to that figure whenever you shop.  </p>
<p>Annie Leonard, Executive Director of Greenpeace USA, claimed this month (June 2018) that,</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">""Recycling alone will never stem the flow of plastics into our oceans; we have to get to the source of the problem and slow down the production of all this plastic waste. Think about it: if your home was flooding because you had left the faucet on, your first step wouldn’t be to start mopping. You’d first cut the flooding off at its source – the faucet. In many ways, our plastics problem is no different""</p>
<p>Your contribution helps close that faucet here in Manchester, it turns off the tap.</p>
</div><div>

</div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","Nourish to Flourish
Flourish Foods started as a tiny idea way back in December 2017 - I'd come home from living in the US where buying in bulk from hoppers was fairly standard for dry foods, and I was trying really hard to reduce our waste even further.  We had an under-1 year old and already did as much as possible with reuseables and non-consumables, yet had this content battle with plastic food packaging.  
I asked on Facebook on 31st December 2017 ""is there such a thing as a food weigh house anymore?""

I expected that as I live in a big, progressive, city, this would absolutely exist and amending our shopping habits slightly would be such an easy win for us ... the response was less than resounding.
 

23 weeks ago I began this journey with a baby, a full-time job and not enough free time to sleep never mind build a brand, but I started working on it anyway - and now, here we are at the final junction before opening and the response from people in Manchester has been overwhelming!
It's the final hurdle and I can't think of any better way to cross the finish line than alongside, and in collaboration with, all the wonderful people who have followed Flourish on this journey.
 
Plastic Activist and why so Drastic?
Plastic is a useful material, we can't deny it.  It's fairly cheap to mass produce, it's durable and it's accessible.  It is unlikely we will ever do away with all plastics, however, single use plastics, pitched as ""disposable"" are literally changing our planet, and not for the better.  Plastics have infiltrated rock formations (http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/06/rocks-ma...), appeared in the food chain (https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/f...) and of course the now all too familiar narrative of trash in our oceans.  

In March this year the devastating news came to Manchester, here, in our beautiful city, we're home to the Riverbed that has the largest number of plastic particles; at 517,000 plastic particles per square meter the River Tame was found to have double the number of micro plastics of any other previously recorded waterway, higher than the beaches off South Korea (https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/gr...).  Something in our city has to change.
The global statistics are frightening;

15 million tonnes of plastic were produced in 1964, by 2014 this figure had risen to 311 million tonnes a figure set to double in the next 20 years.  Single use plastic packaging made up 26% of this figure - that's about 81 million tonnes in 2014; (https://newplasticseconomy.org/assets/doc/Ellen...);
Greenpeace estimate that 12.7 million tonnes of plastic end up in the ocean each year (https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/what-we-do/oceans...);
The UN ""State of Plastics"" report notes that ""The most common single-use plastics found in the environment are, in order of magnitude, cigarette butts, plastic drinking bottles, plastic bottle caps, food wrappers, plastic grocery bags, plastic lids, straws and stirrers, other types of plastic bags, and foam take-away containers. These are the waste products of a throwaway culture that treats plastic as a disposable material rather than a valuable resource to be harnessed""  (https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500...) and goes onto suggest that 50% of plastic WASTE generated in 2015 was packaging (https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500...).



It's really important we start to realise that there is no ""thrown away"" for plastics, and single use plastics are causing a global epidemic where in 2009 there was a measured 6 x more plastic in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre than Plankton (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environm...).  
Plastics do not corrode, or breakdown, they only photodegrade, which means they break down into smaller and smaller pieces (which we now know as micro plastics) but never back to their base components in the same way that metal does for example.  Although a plastic bottle can be recycled, it can never be a plastic bottle again in the same way that a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again, as plastic degrades each time it is recycled.  Refuse first; reduce, reuse and recycle second.

We have an opportunity here in Manchester to show that, once again, we're a city of ideas, we're a city of change, we're a city of innovation, of community and we don't shy away from new ideas and new ways of doing things.  Lets do it for our city, for our waterways and for our world.


What We Need & What You Get
Up to now I have self-funded Flourish including up front rent, marketing, training programmes, website builds, samples and mailboxes.  I have used time off work, and reduced hours which have impacted my salary to get us to where we are now.  But, it isn't enough to get us open.

Our opening figure is low, £6,600.  If we reach our goal we will actually receive £6,270 as Indiegogo charges a 5% fee of monies raised.  
Of that £6,270 we will also be charged a 0.30p transaction fee every time a card is used to fund us PLUS 3% of the amount pledged on that card by Stripe (so for a £10.00 pledge we will receive £9.40, a £20 pledge we will receive £19.10, a £40.00 we will receive £38.50 and so on before loosing 5% to Indigogo).  We will also need to pay VAT on any funding pledges that carry a physical reward and we will have to pay a one time fee of £25.00 to have pledges transferred to us from Indiegogo.  After fees, and charges we should be left with circa. £6,000.
The campaign will pay for:

Till System 
Scales 
Mobile Handwash System 
Initial Orders 
Stock Storage 
Shop Fittings 

If we smash the target then we will buy in the following as levels allow:

Terracycle boxes - We will have basic Teracycle anyway but the mixed stream Terracycle boxes are quite expensive but we will buy them in for the launch if funding allows.  These boxes will allow you to bring your hard to recycle items from home and recycle them with us to raise money for local charities;
Nutrimilk Machine - This is the machine that will allow us to make nut and oat milks freshly while you wait.  It also makes nut butter in small quantities;
Nut Butter Machine - the large self-serve but butter grinders are very expensive and usually require importing so if we totally smash the target we will work towards getting one of these in at Flourish too.

The Perks
I know everyone has been dying to know what the perks are and we made a decision to keep things simple - we flirted with a complex campaign, with many levels of, and types of reward; but, every time we costed it , it came out the same - we'd need a lot more in the funding pot to buy the rewards, to give to you, to thank you for funding us, which meant charging you more for a bag, or a jar, or whatever - we thought you'd just prefer a useful perk that cost less - so we decided to give out something we can do for free, that benefits you, and will never be available again.  Because we also know that some of our non-food items are popular we will be running a pre-order system for them, which will be launched separately to the crowdfunding campaign.

The Impact of your Contribution
We're running a Fixed-Funding campaign; what that essentially means is that we either reach our goal and get funded, or, we don't.  We've chosen this approach to the campaign to protect you, our customers, as, if we don't reach the goal we can't feasibly open and stock Flourish anyway.  We're aiming for the smallest amount possible to get started, and anything less just wouldn't cut the mustard (seeds).  If we fail, then everyone who has pledged to get us open will be refunded in full.  It's riskier for us, but I feel more comfortable knowing that you are protected. 
You contribution will have a direct, and measurable, impact on plastic use within the Greater Manchester area.  We will be tracking and publishing the volume of plastic saved on our website in (almost) real time so not only will you be able to see what we have created and saved together as a whole, but what your specific purchases contribute to that figure whenever you shop.  
Annie Leonard, Executive Director of Greenpeace USA, claimed this month (June 2018) that,
""Recycling alone will never stem the flow of plastics into our oceans; we have to get to the source of the problem and slow down the production of all this plastic waste. Think about it: if your home was flooding because you had left the faucet on, your first step wouldn’t be to start mopping. You’d first cut the flooding off at its source – the faucet. In many ways, our plastics problem is no different""
Your contribution helps close that faucet here in Manchester, it turns off the tap.

Risks & Challenges
Our biggest challenge up until now has been appropriate space; space that would allow us to be authentic to ourselves, space that is reasonably priced and flexible to a start-up and space that would allow to build small and work from there (from tiny acorns).  We are so pleased to have been accepted into the Afflecks family and can't wait to get open now!
Our beautiful little unit is cosy, so, we can't stock everything we initially intended to and this will be a challenge as the reason supermarkets are so popular is because it allows busy people to do one shop, under one roof.  We are going to need to stack as much as we can, as high as we can but we're going to do everything we can to make it work in this space.   
A further risk at the moment is time, to open by 1st August we need to get everything moving as quickly as possible!

<p>We Ahmed Alaa, Mahmoud Habashy, Mohamed Hossany, and Ola Adel, are senior students at Zewail City of Science and Technology, Egypt's National Project for Scientific Renaissance. We are majoring in Environmental Engineering.</p>
<p>We had won the <strong>Hult Prize</strong> National Round here in Egypt and we are going to attend a 6-week accelerator, representing Egypt as a Finalist of Hult Prize Awards Program. We will be <strong>the first Egyptian team</strong> who has this opportunity to attend the annual accelerator held by Hult Prize. We will have a chance to work on our innovative ideas tackling the challenge of Harnessing the Power of Renewable Energy. After the accelerator, the best 6 teams will have a chance to present at the Global Finals of the program, present their solutions at the UN. The accelerator will be held at <strong>Ashridge, United Kingdom from July 22<sup>nd</sup> till September 1<sup>st</sup>, 2018</strong>.</p>
<p>90 million kilograms of animal waste/manure are produced every day in Egypt and large numbers of deaths occur due to the improper management of animal waste. The primary source of animal waste results from farmers who own livestock, so we believe that our project will greatly impact the farmer’s life and the energy sector, by turning the slurry, a liquid-like material that produces from a biogas unit and farmers find a difficulty in dealing with, into a cheaper and healthier fertilizer for plants.</p>
<p>Attending the accelerator will help us to better implement our idea and back to Egypt with enough knowledge and skills to change the community into a better way, hoping to save the poor farmers and their families’ lives, who suffer from diseases that could be due to the pathogens present in the waste. So, we think our journey won’t complete without your kind contributions and help.</p>
<p><strong>Hult International Business School</strong> will be responsible for our accommodation and food during our visit there. But, we have to cover our visa and flight tickets, so we are raising funds to secure them. We were successfully able to collect <strong>$1200</strong> so far, and <strong>$3300</strong> is left. As we need $4500 in total for the whole team.</p>
<p>Your shares, donations and help will really paint the world around us. So, with your support, we will be able to continue our dream. At the end, thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened.  Happiness never decreases by being shared.</p>

We promote environmental education through courses, seminars, action learning workshops, consultations and counselling.AIM: To promote Environmental Education and Environmental protection in Nigeria using Permaculture ethics and principles.OBJECTIVES:To organize permaculture seminars, courses, action learning workshops, conferences, consultations and exchange programs for people and development organizations.To organize counselling for farmers.To arrange training for children and vocational training institution for youths and women.OUR STRENGHT:We already have 5years experience working on the project, so we have a better knowledge of the environment, resources, strength, weakness, opportunities and threats.1: the unique features of the land with its slanty form descending towards the swamp and Badagry lagoon displaying an edge effect.2: we already have trees and shrubs grown over the last 5 years.3: We have passionate volunteers working to ensure the success of the project.4: The project is situated on Gberefu peninsular popularly known as “Point of no return”, a tourist attraction site.5: The land in which the project is situated is in between the sea and the Lagoon.WEAKNESSES:1: Our structures are dilapidated.2: We do not have security.3: The project is not yet sustainable.OPPORTUNITIES:1: We may get support from tourist visiting the peninsular.2: We may get contract from the State Government or Federal Government of Nigeria. if we get the project right as a model for sustainability.3: we will live in abundance as a community if we get it right.THREATS:If we don’t get the proper and timely support, other investors have come threatening to dominate the peninsular. If they succeed the natural greens will give way to the so called “developments” and the peninsular will become vulnerable.If we get proper and timely support:1:- The project will bring people close to nature, to value and appreciate nature and so people will learn to better protect their environment.2:- Deforestation will reduce and tree planting will increase.3:- People will learn organic farming systems.4:- People will learn to adapt renewable resources and services.5:- Poverty rates will reduce as people start applying permaculture ethics and principles.6:- Violence will reduce as people learn to live in harmony with nature through permaculture ethics and conflict resolution programs.7:- Domestic flora and fauna will start to immigrate to contribute to our ecosystem structure and significantly improve the micro climate conditions. PROJECT PLAN AND TIMELINEFrom 15th March 2018, construction and rehabilitation will begin. By 30th March, construction will be fully completed.
Our volunteers will start arriving in the beginning of April.

We shall again kick start our weekend seminars/workshops and film shows (ecological).
In May/June, planting, water gardening and water management.

June-July: Water catchment, purification and storage.

August-September: liquid organic fertilizers and tree planting programs, gardening.

October-November: Seminars on conflict resolution, peace initiatives, community building.

December-January: Evaluation and Celebrations.

February-March: We shall study patterns, application of patterns then we shall round up with innovative skill acquisition programs.

Palawan has been elected most beautiful island in the world three years in a row.
The famous Bacuit bay (El Nido) drives more and more tourists every year into the Northern Province.
However, there is still so much to discover and explore… and so much to protect and restore.
Sibaltan is on the East coast of Palawan directly opposite side from El Nido (less than one hour drive on concrete road) and offers the most amazing sunrises, diving, island hopping, treks...
So close to the booming city of El Nido, yet absolutely untouched and unspoiled.
It has many islands to explore, a much richer marine life (Dugong, turtles, sharks, whales…etc) and yet very few tourists ever wonder there.
Nature is still predominant and the area radiates with a feeling of quietness.
As El Nido is getting overcrowded, Tourism will only grow bigger in Sibaltan, and its essential to start protecting this pristine area as soon as possible.
 List Environmental Issues of the Area
Local fishermen still practice bomb fishing in some areas with disastrous impact on the magnificent reefs and the marine life.
Anchoring from island hopping also destroys coral on wide areas.
Cyanide fishing has been observed and must be stopped.
Turtle egg poaching is common
Sharks are being sold on the market, babies mostly (hammerhead and black tips).
Turtles are being caught and smuggled to Vietnam and China
Sea cows (Dugong) are getting fewer as human activity disturb their habits.
Horseshoe Crabs are being hunted for pharmaceutical purpose and rapidly declining.
Plastic wastes are everywhere and need collecting and recycling.
 What we CAN do:
Restore the bombed reef
Push towards a more responsible fishing
Educate locals and kids to the value of an healthy dive site
Protect and nurse turtle eggs
Protect Horseshoe crabs and coconut crabs
Collect and recycle plastics
Setup mooring boy for island hopping and diving boats
Educate locals and lead campaigns about waste management and re-use policy
Collect data for the scientists to measure the health of the sea and its evolution.
Learn from the local how to live in an always better symbiosis with nature and the use of its amazing gifts.
Limit our own impact on the environment

At present I live in Berlin, Germany, where I work for one of the archaeological companies and plan to start Geoinformation and Environmental Earth Science course this year.I took part in a number of archeological projects in Germany, Poland, Russia, Lebanon Colorado, US and I would like to start my own research in Alaska between 20th of July and 15th of August. My plan, primarily, is to gather information regarding early settlement in America. The tribes that migrated from Asia and resettled in the New World more than twelve thousand years ago.I also got a chance to participate in Walakpa Archaeological Salvage thanks to an archaeologist Anne Jansen. The second part of my project is dedicated to people currently living in Alaska. I’m going to make a photo journal and conduct a survey regarding their everyday life in the extreme environmental conditions and present their opinion on climate changes as well as their plans for future. What I need to complete this mission? The most expensive is the ticket, this is approximately 1,400€. The total cost of the expedition including all the equipment is estimated at 3,000 €.I intend to spend around 700€ on printing photographs, educational materials and organization of exhibitions in Berlin and Warsaw in October- November 2017. My project takes place in Barrow, North Alaska, however, the majority of the time I am going to stay 20 km Southwest of Barrow in Walakpa , this is where the Archaeological Salvage Project takes place. The conditions at the archeological site are very rough and we have to stay in tents in the extreme weather conditions. In my free time I’m going to conduct my own research, collecting samples and evidence of early settlement in the area and changes that happened during thousands of years. Additionally, I would like to interview local people and ask them how they experience global warming and what are their views for future. Do we really have to be afraid of it?  As I will need to stay for a couple of weeks in a tent I need to buy special thermo active clothing to avoid hypothermic shock. Furthermore, because of the lack of electricity and Internet at the excavation site I now need to plan my research step by step and try to be prepare for every possibility. You could help in many ways; I just need to know that my project is important not only for me but also for others.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:</p>
<p>EVA (Electric Visionary Aircrafts) is developing the first world electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft. We designed this aircraft to open a third dimension in cities and remove traffic stress and CO2 from our lives.</p>
<p>Recently we realized by talking to firefighters that our technology could save many people trapped in wildfires. For decades the number of lives taken by wildfires has not decreased, every year thousands of people die trapped in their homes, on the roads or trapped because they wanted to rescue and protect other people.</p>
<p>We cannot get used to that!</p>
<p>This is why we have decided to launch a special project to operate our technology where it will save lives. This week more than 40 people died in California, what if we could have sent several aircraft to rescue them. </p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign you will help to rescue people, you will no more look at news on TV commenting wildfires and counting victims, you will be part of the fight to rescue people! </p>
<p>We need 500,000 to provide 2 test aircraft to organizations such as Calfire in California or Securite Civile in France. </p>

<p>Our strategy is simple:</p>
<p>1. Identify</p>
<p>2. Protect</p>
<p>3. Rescue</p>
<p>We first locate people trapped or confirm their presence with our Valkyr. A unique unmanned Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft which can be carried on firefighters trucks or leave from a firefighters base. We send X01 aircraft, our larger VTOL to protect the evacuation area with water or fire retardants. Finally one or several X01 in rotation land vertically to lift people and remove them from immediate danger. </p>
<p>The Valkyr is right now being built, it will fly December 21. A full carbon structure, 26 engines for a better maneuverability and redundancy (we can lose up to 30 percent of our engines and will still fly), folding wings, dual batteries, advanced cooling system. The same technology applies to the X01.</p>

<h3>Why We’re Mobilizing the Next Generation to Speak Up for Ocean Conservation</h3>
<p>There is a new wave of resistance rising on the horizon. </p>
<p>The Trump Administration and Congress are busy turning back a generation of gains for our ocean including shrinking or eliminating <strong>marine sanctuaries</strong> and <strong>monuments</strong> in order to expand offshore oil drilling while denying the impact of fossil-fueled climate change. These poor decisions are harming jobs, livelihoods, communities and the environment.</p>
<p><strong>What’s on the chopping block? </strong>More than <strong>425 million acres of land, water, and coastline</strong> including marine sanctuaries and national marine monuments. Our current administration and Congress are pushing to sell our cultural heritage by moving forward with a proposal that could potentially open up 95 million acres in the<strong> Gulf of Mexico</strong> to new drilling as well as areas in the <strong>Atlantic</strong>, <strong>Pacific</strong> and <strong>Arctic Ocean.</strong></p>
<p>An oil spill could spell disaster as we saw with the Deepwater Horizon blowout catastrophe of 2010. <strong><a href=""https://www.thepetitionsite.com/takeaction/891/791/272/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sign our petition and say ‘NO!” to offshore drilling.</a> </strong></p>
<p>A poll by Marine Conservation Institute in August 2017, found that out of the <strong>86,000 </strong>public comments submitted to the Department of Commerce on the fate of America’s blue parks,  <a href=""https://blog.marine-conservation.org/2017/08/overwhelming-support-for-marine-monuments-and-sanctuaries.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>99 percent were in favor of protecting them!</strong></a></p>
<p>With widespread support, now is the perfect time for a March for the Ocean on June 9th, 2018! <strong>Blue Frontier Campaign</strong> along with a growing number of partners including <strong>Mission Blue</strong>, <strong>350.org</strong>, <strong>Ocean Futures Society</strong>, the <strong>National Aquarium</strong>, <strong>PADI</strong> and <strong>Earth Guardians</strong> are effectively leading the wave. We’re building an inclusive and diverse coalition, and unifying around <strong>World Oceans Day</strong> weekend to send a message to Congress, this Administration and the WORLD that, <strong>“THE OCEANS ARE RISING AND SO ARE WE!”</strong></p>

Join and share!Estoy haciendo esta campaña porque me importa la vida, nuestro planeta, la naturaleza y nuestros ríos. Cuando tuve una crisis personal, la Madre Tierra me ayudó a sanarme a mí misma y ahora es mi turno de darle una retribución. Si no tomamos acción ahora  a un nivel ambiental, social y legal, tendremos escasez de agua potable y de ríos vivos en 10 años. ¡Únete y comparte! THE PROBLEM El problema More than 50% of the world´s rivers are polluted such as: Salween, Danubio, Plata River, Bravo River, Ganges, Nilo, Indo, Murray-Darling, Mekong, Yangtze, Matanza River, Cuyahoga, Buriganga, Marilao, Sarno River, Citarum, Mississipi River, Doce River, Yellow, Passaic River. Across the world our rivers are dying, because of human waste, plastic trash and factory runoff that are common sources for pollutants found within rivers. Pollution of rivers has profound implications on aquatic and land-based wild life and people who depend on the rivers for food. Adversely, the pollution is affecting their health.Más del 50% de los ríos del mundo están contaminados como: Salween, Danubio, Río de la Plata, Río Bravo, Ganges, Nilo, Indo, Murray-Darling, Mekong, Yangtze, Río Matanza, Cuyahoga, Buriganga, Marilao, Río Sarno , Citarum, Río Mississipi, Río Doce, Amarillo, Río Passaic. Alrededor del mundo, los ríos están muriendo, debido a los desechos humanos, la basura plástica y el residuo de la fábricas que son fuentes comunes de contaminantes que se encuentran en los ríos. La contaminación de los ríos tiene profundas implicaciones en la vida silvestre y acuática, y en las personas que dependen de ellos para obtener alimentos. De manera adversa, la contaminación está afectando su salud. 

More than 80% of wastewater generated by society returns to the ecosystem without having been treated or reused.

1.8 million people use water from polluted rivers for consumption, so they have the risk of contracting serious diseases.

2 million tons of waste are thrown every day in the rivers of our planet.
If things do not change, we will have 40% less water for human consumption and only 20% of Living Rivers by 2030.
 
Más del 80% de las aguas residuales generadas por la sociedad regresa al ecosistema sin haber sido tratada o reutilizada.  
1.8 millones de personas usan el agua de ríos contaminados para consumo por lo que corren el riesgo de contraer enfermedades graves.
Más del 50% de los ríos en el mundo están contaminados por desechos humanos, basura sobre todo plásticos y residuos industriales.
2 millones de toneladas de desperdicios se tiran cada día en los ríos de nuestro planeta.
Si las cosas no cambian, tendremos 40% menos de agua para consumo humano y sólo el 20% de Ríos Vivos para el 2030.

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our medicinal farm is unique in the world. It contains medicinal plant genetics from around the world. From South East Asia, to the Amazon, and the Congo Basin, we have collected rare medicinal plants and are breeding them to provide them back to you, our community. We will need all your help in this fight against Big Palm Oil to keep our plants alive as a seed bank, a conservation project, and as a community benefit for all. </p>
<p>Bulk African Trade has two other plots of land, deep in the rainforest where we plant more of our medicinal plants. But this is the only plot of land with road access, we need a new land with road access as our main farm to move supplies and materials in and out. Those of you who know us, know we provide you with the best products available, and we have excellent customer support of something doesn't go right, as sometimes happens when working with live plants. </p>
<p>We also work with ground breaking technology, recording our farm activities and plants on the immutable ledger of the blockchain with earth.archive project. This is a one-of-its-kind project which records and conserves records of conservation and sustainability project like ours. </p>
<p>We are not an NGO, we are Social Entrepreneurs working to better our company and those involved with it.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have our lawyer fighting against the injustice of the Palm Oil company dumping their kaolin waste on our farm and their intention to make our land a dump site.</p>
<p>We carry the risk that our legal fees will not give us rights to the land. In this case we are fighting a two sided fight. We're also evacuating our plants to a new land. We will need to funds to purchase a new land and move our operations there instead of suffering the mal-intentioned behavior of PCC Organic Oils Palm Company.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot buy any of our products to help out. We can also use your help by spreading the word and sharing our cause. We are fighting against Big Palm Oil and it will not be easy. The more people are on our side, then the better chances we have to getting our medicinal plants our alive. </p>
<p>If you simply just want to send us donations, we will gladly accept your help.</p>

We are also looking for compensation for our farm house on the land, used by our employees at the farm. Our farm house at Abenase, GhanaEdwin at last year's installation of our grid electricity poleOur generator is running the irrigation pumps now after PCC cut off our grid electricityPCC Palm Oil does not want to give us any compensation for their actions. We are a small farming company of only 10 employees and they are an international multibillion dollar company who wish to crush our medicinal farm with no mercy. They purchased the public electrical transformer which also feeds our pumps and have cut off our electricity which we need for irrigation. We have a generator to keep our pumps functional, but this shows how they want to kill our plants with no consideration to their value.

€2,000 New Farm Land
€500 Re-potting, watering supplies, and transplanting materials
€500 Miscellaneous unforeseeables 
 
Our Perks for our contributors are our best deals yet. Check them on the side bar, and if you don't see what you like, ask us and we will make the deal you want!
If we do not reach our goal, all the funds collected will still help towards helping us fight for our rights and move our farm plants and nursery to a new land
 

The Impact
Our medicinal farm is unique in the world. It contains medicinal plant genetics from around the world. From South East Asia, to the Amazon, and the Congo Basin, we have collected rare medicinal plants and are breeding them to provide them back to you, our community. We will need all your help in this fight against Big Palm Oil to keep our plants alive as a seed bank, a conservation project, and as a community benefit for all. 
Bulk African Trade has two other plots of land, deep in the rainforest where we plant more of our medicinal plants. But this is the only plot of land with road access, we need a new land with road access as our main farm to move supplies and materials in and out. Those of you who know us, know we provide you with the best products available, and we have excellent customer support of something doesn't go right, as sometimes happens when working with live plants. 
We also work with ground breaking technology, recording our farm activities and plants on the immutable ledger of the blockchain with earth.archive project. This is a one-of-its-kind project which records and conserves records of conservation and sustainability project like ours. 
We are not an NGO, we are Social Entrepreneurs working to better our company and those involved with it.  
 

Risks & Challenges
We have our lawyer fighting against the injustice of the Palm Oil company dumping their kaolin waste on our farm and their intention to make our land a dump site.
We carry the risk that our legal fees will not give us rights to the land. In this case we are fighting a two sided fight. We're also evacuating our plants to a new land. We will need to funds to purchase a new land and move our operations there instead of suffering the mal-intentioned behavior of PCC Organic Oils Palm Company.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot buy any of our products to help out. We can also use your help by spreading the word and sharing our cause. We are fighting against Big Palm Oil and it will not be easy. The more people are on our side, then the better chances we have to getting our medicinal plants our alive. 
If you simply just want to send us donations, we will gladly accept your help.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We are Damla and Fred. Damla is an agricultural engineer from Turkey, Fred an aerospace engineer from Germany. Our ways crossed in 2011 in Torino - Italy during our Erasmus exchange semester. We wanted to do something about the situation our world is in but didn't really know how to do this. It was during this time when the idea for our farm/living-model was born.</p>
<p>Even though life on our planet, especially our life as humans is in a problematic condition, when looking at the consequences and tendencies of our actions, there are ways towards a bright future. These ways require changes within the whole society - our consciousness. Such a change cannot be done overnight.</p>
<p>The purpose of our project is to show ways and enable change towards a sustainable life. This includes the normal life and lifestyle, agriculture, and conservation/restoration of nature.</p>
<p>We are motivated by our will to make a change, by our love for nature, and by the belief that we are the creators of our own destiny.</p> <p>You can read all about our project on our website</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.waytopecu.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.waytopecu.com</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need financial support to be able to buy farmland and to finance the initial work on the land, which includes water collection and -storage systems, simple housing, a workshop, tools, and equipment. If funding exceeds the initial requirements, it will help to develop the project to full size in a shorter time and therefore enable us to support our surroundings earlier. A detailed and frequently updated cost analysis is shown on our website:</p>
<p>To be more specific, our estimated costs, broken down to development levels, are:</p>
<p><strong>0)</strong> Purchase farmland: 35,000$</p>
<p><strong>I) </strong>Initial work: 51,000$ --&gt; Overall 86,000$</p>
<p><strong>II) </strong>Full autonomy: 65,000$ --&gt; Overall 151,000$</p>
<p><strong>III)</strong> Full size: 121,000$ --&gt; Overall 272,000$</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The main goal for us is to raise funds high enough to initiate the levels <strong>0)</strong> and <strong>I)</strong>. </p>
<p>Our project will start in any case and independent of the funding. However, without it, we have to collect money for at least 10 more years before we can start.</p>
<p>This means YOU can help us make a change NOW.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>What qualifies us to successfully build-up this project? - Damla knows the scientific and practical side of farming and processing plants. On top of this, we are educating ourselves in the field of natural farming/permaculture for more than six years. Fred is proficient in the topic of renewable energies and already developing parts of the later needed technology (e.g. wind turbine, distiller, ...). Apart from this, we are developing the entire farm concept as detailed and realistic as possible, to have a guideline throughout its construction. The results can be seen on our website.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Natural farming:</strong></p>
<p>Is there a risk that it doesn't work? - There is no risk that it doesn't work. However, it can take some years until a system of natural farming is established, especially if the soil quality must be improved/revived in the beginning. We expect a time of 2-5 years (up to 10-15 years for trees/orchard).</p>
<p>Will the harvest be comparable to chemical farming? - The harvest of natural farming is, in fact, comparable and can exceed the harvest of chemical farming while only using a fraction of the invested energy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Commercial strategies - earning money:</strong></p>
<p>How will we avoid going bankrupt? - We will not stand on only one leg. Our plan is to earn money with three main strategies (growing and processing of medicinal herbs, bamboo, and hemp), and optional side strategies that are not fixed yet (small series production of sustainable technology, e.g. wind turbines; educational tourism; café/part-time-restaurant/exchange-library; ...). If one strategy temporarily fails, we will be able to compensate.</p>
<p>How can you grow hemp in Turkey? - Growing industrial hemp under strict and monitored conditions is legal in several states of the Turkish Republic. However, we are sure that this will be a bureaucratic challenge - one that we are ready to take.</p>

<p>We will open a whole new section on our webpage that follows the development of the project. It will display all project-related expenses. This is not only assurance for everybody who funds us but it will also serve as a guideline for others who are in the planning of a comparable project.</p>

<h3>Umgebindehaus</h3>Wir sind eine 3-köpfige Familie: 
Mutter Susanne, Vater Carl-Philip und Sohn Luke. Wir wohnen in einem 
Plattenbau im 5. Stock, was sehr anstrengend für meine (gelegentlich 
schwangere) Frau ist. Wir wollen nur noch zurück in die Natur.<br/><br/>Die Oberlausitz ist eine ostsächsische Bergregion an der Grenze zu Polen und Tschechien. Sie ist bekannt für ihre typischen <b>Umgebindehäuser</b>
 - 200-500 Jahre alten Häusern, die komplett aus Holz, Lehm und 
Natursteinen gebaut sind. Eine Blockstube im Erdgeschoss gewährleistet 
gute Dämmung selbst im tiefsten Winter. Ein Fachwerk um die Blockstube 
herum gebaut setzt weitere Stockwerke auf.<br/><br/>Viele Umgebindehäuser 
sind in gutem Zustand, weil sie bewohnt sind. Aber es gibt auch 
verlassene Umgebindehäuser. Wir wollen in solch eines ziehen und dies 
sanieren. Wir wollen so viel wie möglich originale Materialien 
einsetzen, da diese Jahrhunderte halten werden.
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Was wir tun wollen</h3> <p>Alte Holzhäuser sind gemütlich, doch dieses Haus wurde das 
letzte mal vor dem zweiten Weltkrieg renoviert. Es gibt eine Menge zu 
tun, bevor es sich dort wieder komfortabel wohnen lässt:
</p>
<ul> <li>Neue Fenster einsetzen</li>
<li>Lehmputz an der Fassade erneuern</li>
<li>Dämmung des Unterbodens mit Glasschotter (momentan ist nur Erdreich darunter)</li>
<li>Dabei Einbau einer Fußbodenheizung</li>
<li>Erneuerung der Elektrik</li>
<li>Wasserleitungen und Plumpsklo durch modernere Varianten ersetzen<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wir können dieses Haus für 20.000 Euro kaufen. Unser Plan ist, noch 
weitere 60.000 Euro in die Renovierung zu investieren. Insgesamt 
benötigen wir also etwa 80.000 Euro. Wir haben das Kampagnen-Ziel auf 
25.000, sodass wir zumindest das Haus und einige Werkzeuge kaufen 
können, um anzufangen.
</p>
<p>Sollten wir mehr Geld einsammeln, als wir brauchen, ist das kein 
Problem. Das Haus hat 3 Stockwerke, von dem wir vorerst nur das erste 
renovieren. Die anderen Stockwerke reservieren wir für Gäste und mehr 
Kinder.

<h3>Warum solltest du uns unterstützen?</h3>
<p>Meine Frau ist Vollzeit-Mutter und ich bin Selbstständiger - beste 
Voraussetzungen für eine Kreditvergabe, oder? Zusätzlich halten wir 
nicht viel von Zins-Verschuldungen (ganz abzusehen von der Grundschuld). Wir sehen einen Bank-Kredit als

<h3>Wann wollen wir das tun?</h3>Nachdem die Finanzierung steht, wollen wir das Haus im September 
2016 kaufen. Die Kündigungsfrist unserer alten Wohnung beträgt 3 Monate.
 Wir werden die Zeit nutzen, uns ein kleines Ofen-Zimmer herzurichten, 
wo wir den Winter überdauern können. Von dort aus können wir anfangen, 
am Haus zu arbeiten.<br/><br/>Nach etwa einem Jahr harter Arbeit denken 
wir, dass das Haus in einem Zustand ist, dass man gut darin leben kann.

<p>We will be able to buy this house for 20,000 Euro. Our plan is to invest about 60,000 Euro in renovation. So we need 80,000 Euro in total. We set our campaign goal at 25,000 Euro so that we can at least buy the house and some tools to start working.<br/></p>
<p>It is not a problem if we collect more money than we need.. The house has three floors and for the moment, we are only plan to renovate the ground floor. The other floors are reserved for guests and more children.<br/></p>

are to run over a longer period (at least three years), in order to have a

the incidence of light on and under the structure as well as soil data
(temperature, carbon content and moistness at different depths) in many

sub-structure for the photovoltaic facility will be somewhat more expensive,
since it has to be erected higher than usual to give enough clearance for
tractors.
Crop cultivation under the PV modulesScientific
literature shows that there are plants that deliver an identical or even higher
return in partial shade compared to those exposed to direct sunlight. According
to our sources this even includes plants such as lettuce, rye or potatoes.
In
order to be able to make scientifically relevant statements, the experiments
are to run over a longer period (at least three years), in order to have a
better understanding of the influence of the weather and the climate. For this,
it is necessary to install numerous, different sensors, which continuously and
simultaneously measure the weather data (temperature, precipitation and wind),
the incidence of light on and under the structure as well as soil data
(temperature, carbon content and moistness at different depths) in many
positions.
The
electricity generated and the food products will be sold and the proceeds
reinvested.  However, this will only
result in a small contribution to the project financing.
If
we do not achieve the funding objective, we will, depending on the volume,
erect a smaller PV facility and research fewer plants with our partners. If we
get more than our objective, we can conduct more research or even erect a
second research facility.What you give us and what you getAs
a perk we will give you our findings: Since many people have a small garden or
terrace and can doubly use their own areas in future. Thus it is not a
donation, it is an investment in our and your future!The
project is very important, since it is:• 
globally a forerunner.• 
directly relevant for many regions worldwide (like aride regions e.g. Northern Africa, Middle East...)• 
produces organic products and ecological power in parallel.• 
delivers scientific knowledge.• 
can demonstrate how well PV facilities can protect the plants
from the negative effects of the climate change, such as droughts, storm, hail
and torrential rain.• 
can make regions economically more independent with more
self-production of food and power.The
consequencesEvery
project contains risks. Since Patrick already owns the land, and has
appropriate references and the approval to erect a photovoltaic facility, this
project has a high probability of implementation. He has already invested his
own capital.
However,
the facility approved by the authorities is a ""normal"" facility. It
is now a question of submitting the changes to the facility and obtaining the
approval of the authorities. If
the changes are not approved, we plan to build the approved facility, making
minor modifications, so that an approval by the authorities is no longer
necessary.The
more support we get from you, the better. So join us and take a look at our perks in the right column.Our goal is to generate at least 500,000 USD. With this amount we can create a smaller system with only one species of plant. With a total of 1,000,000 USD we would be able to set up a scientifically relevant project with various kind of vegetables and crops.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>My son and I are working to protect the sea turtle populations that nest on the pacific coast of Nicaragua, near Puerto Salinas. Our focus is to provide smale scale solutions to problems in Nicaragua, especially those affecting the local ecology and living conditions. We work with the philosophy to help conserve the natural environment and benefit the local communities where we operate.</p>
<p>The area near Puerto Salinas is rich with bio-diversity, including turtle hatching areas going back milennia. But they have been poached for generations for food and income, so we want to change that by buying the eggs from the poachers for the same price and re-nesting the eggs in a secure turtle hatchery. It's a win-win scenario.</p>
<p>We also want to make this self sustaining, so we will start by building 2 cabanas (one room buildings) where visitors can stay. The rental income will be use solely to fund future operations of the hatchery and this hostel.</p>
<p>Over the past year, we've been negotiating with a local resort developer to donate land for a turtle hatchery and hostel on their property. This was the hardest part. In our agreement, they've stipulated that we raise the money needed to build the hatchery and the first two cabanas (the 'hostel') in the first year, and cover all operational costs for the first year.</p>
<p>Once the cabanas are built, they can be rented to visiting backpackers, small groups and families who want a truly unique experience working with the turtles. The rental income will be used solely to hire local staff, buy the eggs from the poachers, build more buildings on the lot, and generally run the operation.</p>
<p>Visitors will be able to help with the turtle hostel (i.e. releasing the turtles), as well as participate in the outdoor and water activities provided by the Playa Tesoro Resort.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Based on local quotes, we need $17,500 to build the hatchery, 2 cabanas and support building. The first years' operation costs include $1,000 for onsite staff, and $3,500 to buy the eggs from the locals.</p>
<p>We have smaller perks to make you feel good if you cannot visit us, and larger perks if you want to visit us to see the turtles during their hatching season. To really see the excitement of helping in the release of the turtles, <a href=""https://youtu.be/igiDeJLX0dQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">watch this video</a>.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, YOU WILL HELP SAVE UPTO 5000 TURTLE EGGS IN THE FIRST YEAR AND PROVIDE A STABLE INCOME FOR NATIVE NICARAGUANS. And you are sending a message that you support the ecology!</p>
<p>If this campaign is really successful, we can start to build another 2 cabanas, install a night camera linked to our website, perform an extensive beach cleanup, improve the planned education center, and add a unique water collection system on the site for the local community (as an alternative to using local stream and waterways).</p>

We are now expanding our concept into a second location and will open  New Jersey's FIRST dedicated plastic-free grocery store in Montclair.  This store will offer all the key grocery essentials and categories from dry goods and fresh produce to dairy and fresh-baked breads-- all free of packaging and plastic waste.Imagine being able to shop for all the following without waste or plastic packaging :
beans, grains, rice and pastas
cooking oils, honey, syrup and vinegars
spices, snacks and cereals
bulk coffee and loose leaf teas
local eggs, milk, dairy and cheeses
fresh farm produce
artisanal fresh-baked breads 
alternative mylks
frozen foods and refrigerated refills (condiments, etc.) 
 We also will open a store that represents and directly supports the local community. In addition to continuing our support of small, organic farmers, we will expand our offerings through partnerships with several Montclair specialty businesses, including Paper Plane Coffee for bulk coffee beans and Le French Dad Boulangerie for fresh-baked breads. And by highlighting local businesses as much as possible we will also be filling our store with high quality products as sustainably as possible.We also will carry locally made items prepared foods like pasta sauce, condiments and hummus -- all in returnable, fully sanitized, reusable containers that never get thrown away: a true closed-loop refill system! You simply bring back the empty jar when you're finished and swap it out for a new one. We don't want more stuff to throw away in the trash and we don't want our food sources or supply chains to be part of the problem.Our previous experience has shown that not only is this possible, but that shopping this way provides a successful way to partner with and grow small businesses within the community. A true win-win!We will build off of our existing experience, but we need YOU and our #refillrevolution community to help us turn our full vision into reality. With this campaign, we are looking to raise $20,000 to properly outfit our shop with:

gravity bins -- bulk storage for dried goods (e.g. beans, grains, rice) that allow for contact-free dispensing

produce merchandisers -- refrigeration to properly keep loose produce fresh and sold in a way that easily allows customers to access it

dairy refrigeration  -- refrigeration for returnable glass milk jugs, farm fresh eggs and other refrigerated essentials
 Want to see our stretch goals? The more money we raise, the more we can do:And remember, we're building Dry Goods Refillery to directly support Montclair and the surrounding community. After you donate feel free to contact us and let us know what you want to see most in the shop!We are so grateful for each and every dollar contributed toward this campaign. To thank you for your support, we're providing a selection of perks including items from our grocery assortment that highlight some of our favorite local and sustainable offerings. We appreciate contributions from anyone who believes in a low-waste grocery mission; nevertheless our success is dependent on the support of our local community. Therefore please note that any products in our rewards will be for local pick up only, and arranged only after the end of our fundraising campaign. Shipping worldwide creates a lot of additional waste and negatively contributes to our planet's carbon footprint -- going against our company’s mission. If you wish to choose your donation amount or donate without a perk:

PROBLEM: Packaging pollution is a serious problem. Single-use plastics account for 50% of plastics produced and are one of the most common items found in our oceans (NRDC). SOLUTION: Dry Goods Refillery will expand upon our existing efforts and eliminate unnecessary plastic packaging for all the items typically purchased in a grocery store. We will offer the option of BYOC (bring your own container) and also a closed-loop system to reuse and replace containers._______________________________________________________________PROBLEM: We have a food waste problem. The average American household wastes over 30% of their food purchased (AAEA) and that waste most likely ends up in a landfill where it generates harmful levels of methane gas, a leading contributor to climate change (EPA). SOLUTION: Our store will allow customers to purchase their items by weight, taking as much or as little as they like --  preventing food waste while saving on costs. We also will partner with the locally owned commercial composting service Java's Compost to ensure any waste we incur is properly disposed of and composted._______________________________________________________________PROBLEM: Recycling is not working. Most attempts at recycling are just ""wish-cycling."" According to the EPA, only 35% of what is placed in the bin actually gets recycled and only 8% of plastics are repurposed into something new. SOLUTION: Our core mission is to eliminate plastic packaging whenever possible.  Any we do obtain will be disposed of properly through our partnership with TerraCycle, a New Jersey company and innovative leader in recycling hard-to-recycle materials.Watch this recent video interview we did at our Maplewood shop to learn more about our family, our story and how fun refilling can be. Want to see more of our press coverage?

<h2>The Key To This Project</h2>
<p>We're building the stays, but the last key to opening Azhen Resort is the spa... That's where we need your help.</p>
<p>We want to build the most effective, natural, eco conscious hydrotherapy spa!</p>
<p><strong>Here's where we're at now:</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603679492/i5v47lanxfuql82ew6ds.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>This is a unique design because it is:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>100% off-grid using solar power and wood fire</li>
<li>100% mobile designs that don't harm the environment beneath it and can be picked up and moved; and, </li>
<li>Uses only fresh spring water with no chemical additives, using an ionization filtering process.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here's what we want to turn it into:</strong></p>
<p>We want to bring our functional designs to a new level of beauty and create a full hydrotherapy spa.</p>

<p>So what the heck is hydrotherapy? Honestly... probably one of the best things you'll ever experience.</p>
<p>It's a ""circuit spa"" meaning you make your way through a stunningly designed landscape of a variety of spa features.</p>
<p>Specifically you're supposed to go Hot &gt; Cold &gt; &amp; Relax </p>
<ul>
<li>Hangout in wood fire saunas, cedar hot tubs or the steam room;</li>
<li>Then go for a super quick cold plunge in a tub or outdoor shower;</li>
<li>Then read a book in a relaxing solarium with a view, or maybe have a nap or ponder your thoughts in a hammock, and finish it off in a glowing warm salt room;</li>
<li>And repeat! All day long if you want...</li>

<p>Everything you do and learn while you stay with us will reflect all over the world, like a ripple effect... but you’re not just dropping one stone in the pond, you’re dropping dozens.</p>
<p>Everything is <strong>sourced from meaningful suppliers</strong>, from the furniture and decor to the soap and shampoo.</p>
<p><strong>Our partners for making this impact are</strong> Charity Water, One Tree Planted, The Foundry (mental health care providers), Central Okanagan Food Bank, Muller Motors (renewable energy research) and a variety of alternative energy labs startups, and multiple local Indian bands and Elders in the local area. Indigenous education and offerings will take place on the land.</p>
<p>Some initiatives are worldwide and others are local, depending on what makes sense. So of course at each new Azhen location, we'll be partnering with new partners local to that area.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Location &amp; Map</h2>
<p>This the first location of many is in the Okanagan, BC, Canada</p>

<h3>About The Founders</h3>
<p><strong>Jaymie Friesen</strong></p>
<p>Jaymie has been planning to create this space since he was a teenager. His journey has taken him on side tracks through 20 jobs, 5 businesses, inventions, mental health battles, travelling to over 15 countries, joining the army, electrical and physics programs in university, seeing over 40 different styles of health and wellness practitioners, taking years off for meditation and study of the mind, and ultimately finding what it means to live a healthy, conscious, happy life. All that time, this dream lived in his mind - a place to foster awareness, open-mindedness, healing, and living with nature... where we all belong. Now the search is over, and it's coming to life.</p>
<p><strong>Shelby Friesen</strong></p>
<p>Shelby was living an exciting life as an entrepreneur and metal fabricator with lack of sleep, poor nutrition, and high stress... he eventually woke up one day and found himself bedridden from severe anxiety and depression. After 6 months of his ongoing illness doctors and traditional practitioners were still unable to figure out what was wrong with him. He desperately tried anything and everything and discovered powerful healing through nutrition, mindset and physical activity... leading him down a path of conscious living and personal growth. Shelby sold his business RYD Motorsports, a successful brand of custom engineered automotive parts, to pursue Azhen and create personal development courses to help others live incredible, healthy lives, and find their passion. </p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p><strong>Safe Budgeting</strong></p>
<p>While we have a budget sheet and business plan detailed with costs and suppliers, budgeting is always a risk. We have identified the risks and setup backup plans for each of them. Some of these include a general 10% markup on everything for room for error, backup investors that are kept up to date on the project, buying things used and refurbishing, stockpiling of materials when we find good deals, optional backup financing for things, and more. At the end of the day... This is a passion project that we have dedicated our lives to, and it will be happening one way or another, and we have planned for this.</p>
<p><strong>Staying On Time &amp; Stopping Delays</strong></p>
<p>To shorten timelines we have partnered with experienced skilled builders for the dwellings that require it, and will be pre-fabricating many of the dwellings and spa features at an on-grid location so that they are quicker and easier to build and after the Indiegogo campaign is complete we can transport them and set them up. We are a family of contractors with over 100 years of combined experience building everything from barns to high end homes and custom equipment. The main risks with timelines is going to be manufacturing, shipping and logistics of necessary materials, and seasonality. We have acquired timelines from our suppliers and partners, extended them for extra room, and set reasonable timelines for ourselves, keeping the state of worldwide logistics in mind (due to COVID). We have mitigated seasonality (winter and weather conditions) by finding an on-grid heated location to pre-fabricate our stays. </p>
<p><strong>Professional Cleaners &amp; COVID Safety</strong></p>
<p>We have partnered with professional cleaners that will be for free on the land as caretakers, that own a cleaning business specializing in airbnb and resort management. Everyone will be consulted about COVID prior to their stay, and every stay and amenity will be sanitized, and free masks and sanitizer will be available for everyone. This is 160 acres, with dwellings well spaced out so that you can easily stay distanced from others and enjoy all the amenities. All hot tubs will be equipped with a brand new ionization filtration system. </p>
<p><strong>Preventing Forest Fires</strong></p>
<p>Forest fires are not uncommon in the area, luckily the government is logging the crown land around us so we will have a 1 mile fire break on all sides of us. We have worked with local fire fighters and fire prevention consultants and have a fire prevention plan in place, including an industrial emergency sprinkler system and the majority of the housing is mobile or component style housing that can be removed from the property in a short amount of time (hours). All of the housing, spa and community buildings are built with fire mobility and fire prevention in mind. The mile wide fire break around us will be replanted with gardens and used for permaculture farming.</p>
<p><strong>Bylaws &amp; Building Permits: Best Zoning In The Country</strong></p>
<p>Our first location is in Rock Creek (35 minutes from Osoyoos, 1 hour from Big White Ski Resort, 1.5 hours from Kelowna International Airport) in ""Electoral Area E"" which is zoned as a ""no zone"" area. This rare land zoning means that there is no limit to the amount or type of structures that we can build, only that they have to meet BC builders code. This means, for example, that we could build a skyscraper, a roller coaster, or anything we want, so long as it meets the builders code. This makes it incredibly easy because we don't have any bylaws, and it's easy to get permits and insurance for unique dwellings. You can find this on this interactive government map: <a href=""https://rdkb.sgrc.selkirk.ca/default_HTML5.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://rdkb.sgrc.selkirk.ca/default_HTML5.htm</a> (Regional District of Kootney Boundary) by opening the map, and selecting the ""Layers"" option, scrolling down the zoning, and you'll find ""Electoral Area E - no zoning"" and can see the area.</p>

<h2>The Resort Ecosystem &amp; More Amenities</h2>
<h3>A Regenerative Economy</h3>
<p>A Linear Economy is when items are used and thrown away.</p>
<p>A Recycling Economy is when items are recycled into new things.</p>
<p>The world operates mainly on a linear economy right now. Although we do have recycling programs... 97% of plastic, for example, may NOT be recycled in North America. Even when it's picked up at your curb. I've worked in the environmental sector for years, diving deep into these issues to find a solution.</p>
<p>Everything that is produces goes back to the earth eventually.</p>
<p>We believe in an economy where things come from the earth, and can go back to the earth the same way.</p>
<p>This means we eliminate waste all together, refurbish or up-cycle materials to keep them in use, and use regenerating natural systems like compostable materials.</p>
<p>All the products you use here from the plastic-free toiletries to the furniture and power systems, are a part of a carbon-positive Regenerative Economy.</p>
<h3>Power Systems</h3>
<p>Everything is entirely off-grid, running completely off the land with solar and wind power. In the future we would like to experiment with additional forms of alternative energy including geothermal, magnetic motors, and more, to demonstrate their use the public.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603680808/ndnuccmjuurgn7c5580e.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Bathrooms &amp; Showers</h3>
<p>All toilets are state of the art compost toilets. You wouldn't know the difference between a regular toilet (no smelly outhouses around here!). This technology is odourless, clean, and can be turned into compost.</p>
<p>Showers at the spa will be Nebia showers, which use 50-65% less water than a traditional shower head, with 40% more water coverage, offering a unique spa-like shower experience.</p>
<p>We're big on bathrooms! This will be no ordinary ""camp"" bathroom experience. This will be individual private bathrooms overlooking an outdoor garden with indoor and outdoor shower options.</p>
<h3><strong>More Info About The Spa</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>It will face two directions with the most gorgeous views on the property to enjoy at any of the stations (the green borders on the map);</li>
<li>We want it to be stunningly landscaped with gardens for an immersive nature experience, and feature stone walkways;</li>
<li>We want it to operate year-round from 7am-10pm, enjoy it for as long as you want.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every backer gets a copy of all the Do It Yourself (DIY) information for this project so you can see how it's been built and could even build it yourself.</p>
<p>The resort will be equipped with Nebia shower systems, using 50% less water and providing you with a one-of-a-kind spa shower experience.</p>

What Unique Stays Are We Building Here?
Discover that living sustainably is fun and exciting! Or try glamping with one of our wall tents or tiny homes. Or bring your own!
Hobbit Homes

Building Supplier: Green Magic Homes. Completion Date Goal: June 2021.

One of the most sustainable types of dwellings, the ""hobbit"" home is fully insulated by the earth and the vegetation around and on top of it;
The roof acts as a rain water catchment system and is filtered for drinking, showers, cooking and growing food;
This is made with an eco friendly biopolymer/fibre mix, and comes in lightweight panels that are assembled on site, reducing the carbon footprint of delivery and construction by over 85% compared to a traditional home.
We are also very interested in cob homes!

 
Traditional Treehouses

Building Plans & Photo Credit: Nelson Treehouse (can buy plans of your own here!). Est. Completion Date: June 2021.
Traditional treehouses showcase conscious building using the same wood that is already existing on the land, fully sustainable, and nothing imported (most buildings import up to 50% of their materials).
 
Yurts, Wall Tents, Tipis & GeoDomes

Current Phase: We already have some and are ordering an additional 5 geodomes, 5 luxury insulated wall tents. Est. Completion Setup Date: February 2021.
Our ancestors, from many cultures, travelled often for food, with seasons, and to attend gatherings. They lived in ""mobile"" housing that they could take down and easily resurrect. When you stay in these, you can learn how they were used, built, and even help build one yourself!

Here we combine ancient culture with more modern yet still traditional-inspired furnishings and finishings;
Each unit has a spacious outdoor entertaining area with wood burning fire places and comfy spaces to feel at home in nature year round.

 
Tiny Homes, Converted Busses & Vans

Building Supplier & Photo Credit: Sunshine Tiny Homes. (Sunshine Tinyhomes has financing partners and makes it easy to get into affordable living! Check them out!) Est. Completion Goal: April, 2021. (We were hoping to have one sooner but they're going fast! They do great work.)
It's our goal to let you experience the greatest sustainable ways of living, and tiny homes, converted busses and converted vans are a must! Many people have dreamt of living in one, or maybe you just want to experience it first? Try it here with renovated vans and busses and learn what it's all about.

These options are widely known for their freedom, mobility, and affordability;
Tiny homes are a fraction of the cost and material compared to other types of homes, and we reuse and repurpose up to 70% of materials.

 
The Key To This Project
We're building the stays, but the last key to opening Azhen Resort is the spa... That's where we need your help.
We want to build the most effective, natural, eco conscious hydrotherapy spa!
Here's where we're at now:

This is a unique design because it is:

100% off-grid using solar power and wood fire
100% mobile designs that don't harm the environment beneath it and can be picked up and moved; and, 
Uses only fresh spring water with no chemical additives, using an ionization filtering process.

Here's what we want to turn it into:
We want to bring our functional designs to a new level of beauty and create a full hydrotherapy spa.
 
Example of Hydrotherapy Spa Immersed in Nature with an Incredible View
So what the heck is hydrotherapy? Honestly... probably one of the best things you'll ever experience.
It's a ""circuit spa"" meaning you make your way through a stunningly designed landscape of a variety of spa features.
Specifically you're supposed to go Hot > Cold > & Relax 

Hangout in wood fire saunas, cedar hot tubs or the steam room;
Then go for a super quick cold plunge in a tub or outdoor shower;
Then read a book in a relaxing solarium with a view, or maybe have a nap or ponder your thoughts in a hammock, and finish it off in a glowing warm salt room;
And repeat! All day long if you want...

 

Proposed Azhen Hydrotherapy Spa: In a Prime Location For The Best View
 
You're Giving Back in a BIG Way
You can learn what conscious living is all about, all while giving back...


*Stay or retreat actually plants 10 trees, not 3!
Everything you do and learn while you stay with us will reflect all over the world, like a ripple effect... but you’re not just dropping one stone in the pond, you’re dropping dozens.
Everything is sourced from meaningful suppliers, from the furniture and decor to the soap and shampoo.
Our partners for making this impact are Charity Water, One Tree Planted, The Foundry (mental health care providers), Central Okanagan Food Bank, Muller Motors (renewable energy research) and a variety of alternative energy labs startups, and multiple local Indian bands and Elders in the local area. Indigenous education and offerings will take place on the land.
Some initiatives are worldwide and others are local, depending on what makes sense. So of course at each new Azhen location, we'll be partnering with new partners local to that area.
 
Location & Map
This the first location of many is in the Okanagan, BC, Canada
But don't worry! If this isn't near you, we are already scouting for a second location and will be expanding around the world. 
Back us today to get your vote in on the next location.
Map of The First Location

Green borders indicate the best views. Stays are located in areas that offer views of the surrounding mountains, valleys, sunrises and sunsets;
We are located in Rock Creek, 35 minutes from Osoyoos, 90 minutes from Kelowna & Kelowna International Airport;
Only 35-60 minutes away from some of the best wineries, ski resorts, and tourism destinations in North America.

 
About The Founders
Jaymie Friesen
Jaymie has been planning to create this space since he was a teenager. His journey has taken him on side tracks through 20 jobs, 5 businesses, inventions, mental health battles, travelling to over 15 countries, joining the army, electrical and physics programs in university, seeing over 40 different styles of health and wellness practitioners, taking years off for meditation and study of the mind, and ultimately finding what it means to live a healthy, conscious, happy life. All that time, this dream lived in his mind - a place to foster awareness, open-mindedness, healing, and living with nature... where we all belong. Now the search is over, and it's coming to life.
Shelby Friesen
Shelby was living an exciting life as an entrepreneur and metal fabricator with lack of sleep, poor nutrition, and high stress... he eventually woke up one day and found himself bedridden from severe anxiety and depression. After 6 months of his ongoing illness doctors and traditional practitioners were still unable to figure out what was wrong with him. He desperately tried anything and everything and discovered powerful healing through nutrition, mindset and physical activity... leading him down a path of conscious living and personal growth. Shelby sold his business RYD Motorsports, a successful brand of custom engineered automotive parts, to pursue Azhen and create personal development courses to help others live incredible, healthy lives, and find their passion.

Risks & Challenges
Safe Budgeting
While we have a budget sheet and business plan detailed with costs and suppliers, budgeting is always a risk. We have identified the risks and setup backup plans for each of them. Some of these include a general 10% markup on everything for room for error, backup investors that are kept up to date on the project, buying things used and refurbishing, stockpiling of materials when we find good deals, optional backup financing for things, and more. At the end of the day... This is a passion project that we have dedicated our lives to, and it will be happening one way or another, and we have planned for this.
Staying On Time & Stopping Delays
To shorten timelines we have partnered with experienced skilled builders for the dwellings that require it, and will be pre-fabricating many of the dwellings and spa features at an on-grid location so that they are quicker and easier to build and after the Indiegogo campaign is complete we can transport them and set them up. We are a family of contractors with over 100 years of combined experience building everything from barns to high end homes and custom equipment. The main risks with timelines is going to be manufacturing, shipping and logistics of necessary materials, and seasonality. We have acquired timelines from our suppliers and partners, extended them for extra room, and set reasonable timelines for ourselves, keeping the state of worldwide logistics in mind (due to COVID). We have mitigated seasonality (winter and weather conditions) by finding an on-grid heated location to pre-fabricate our stays. 
Professional Cleaners & COVID Safety
We have partnered with professional cleaners that will be for free on the land as caretakers, that own a cleaning business specializing in airbnb and resort management. Everyone will be consulted about COVID prior to their stay, and every stay and amenity will be sanitized, and free masks and sanitizer will be available for everyone. This is 160 acres, with dwellings well spaced out so that you can easily stay distanced from others and enjoy all the amenities. All hot tubs will be equipped with a brand new ionization filtration system. 
Preventing Forest Fires
Forest fires are not uncommon in the area, luckily the government is logging the crown land around us so we will have a 1 mile fire break on all sides of us. We have worked with local fire fighters and fire prevention consultants and have a fire prevention plan in place, including an industrial emergency sprinkler system and the majority of the housing is mobile or component style housing that can be removed from the property in a short amount of time (hours). All of the housing, spa and community buildings are built with fire mobility and fire prevention in mind. The mile wide fire break around us will be replanted with gardens and used for permaculture farming.
Bylaws & Building Permits: Best Zoning In The Country
Our first location is in Rock Creek (35 minutes from Osoyoos, 1 hour from Big White Ski Resort, 1.5 hours from Kelowna International Airport) in ""Electoral Area E"" which is zoned as a ""no zone"" area. This rare land zoning means that there is no limit to the amount or type of structures that we can build, only that they have to meet BC builders code. This means, for example, that we could build a skyscraper, a roller coaster, or anything we want, so long as it meets the builders code. This makes it incredibly easy because we don't have any bylaws, and it's easy to get permits and insurance for unique dwellings. You can find this on this interactive government map: https://rdkb.sgrc.selkirk.ca/default_HTML5.htm (Regional District of Kootney Boundary) by opening the map, and selecting the ""Layers"" option, scrolling down the zoning, and you'll find ""Electoral Area E - no zoning"" and can see the area.
 
Our Qualifications
We are a family of trades. Jaymie is an electrician by trade, but has a passion for wood working and has built homes from the ground up. Shelby is a metal fabricator and erector, experienced with building larger scale projects and machine operating. We are surrounded by qualified family members and contractors in every trade specializing in high end custom homes, and have partnered with specialized builders when needed. 
Jaymie is an environmental entrepreneur, and Shelby is a natural health and nutrition entrepreneur, with combined 7 businesses under their belt with 20+ years experience.
Azhen is their full-time focus and lifelong passion.
 
The Resort Ecosystem & More Amenities
A Regenerative Economy
A Linear Economy is when items are used and thrown away.
A Recycling Economy is when items are recycled into new things.
The world operates mainly on a linear economy right now. Although we do have recycling programs... 97% of plastic, for example, may NOT be recycled in North America. Even when it's picked up at your curb. I've worked in the environmental sector for years, diving deep into these issues to find a solution.
Everything that is produces goes back to the earth eventually.
We believe in an economy where things come from the earth, and can go back to the earth the same way.
This means we eliminate waste all together, refurbish or up-cycle materials to keep them in use, and use regenerating natural systems like compostable materials.
All the products you use here from the plastic-free toiletries to the furniture and power systems, are a part of a carbon-positive Regenerative Economy.
Power Systems
Everything is entirely off-grid, running completely off the land with solar and wind power. In the future we would like to experiment with additional forms of alternative energy including geothermal, magnetic motors, and more, to demonstrate their use the public.

Bathrooms & Showers
All toilets are state of the art compost toilets. You wouldn't know the difference between a regular toilet (no smelly outhouses around here!). This technology is odourless, clean, and can be turned into compost.
Showers at the spa will be Nebia showers, which use 50-65% less water than a traditional shower head, with 40% more water coverage, offering a unique spa-like shower experience.
We're big on bathrooms! This will be no ordinary ""camp"" bathroom experience. This will be individual private bathrooms overlooking an outdoor garden with indoor and outdoor shower options.
More Info About The Spa

It will face two directions with the most gorgeous views on the property to enjoy at any of the stations (the green borders on the map);
We want it to be stunningly landscaped with gardens for an immersive nature experience, and feature stone walkways;
We want it to operate year-round from 7am-10pm, enjoy it for as long as you want.

Every backer gets a copy of all the Do It Yourself (DIY) information for this project so you can see how it's been built and could even build it yourself.
The resort will be equipped with Nebia shower systems, using 50% less water and providing you with a one-of-a-kind spa shower experience.

wild. In fact, government scientists have acknowledged that these fish could
breed with wild salmon. </p>
<p>Canada’s
federal government has shrouded almost every aspect of its dealings around GM
salmon in acloud of secrecy, denying any public
scrutiny of its processes. Living Oceans and Ecology Action are trying to shed

help Canada’s Ecology Action Centre and Living Oceans Society take the Canadian federal government to court over its approval of the manufacture of genetically
modified salmon eggs! $10, $20, $200 – every cent counts in this historic
fight.
Late last
November, the Government of Canada okayed the manufacture and export of GM salmon eggs by Aquabounty, Inc., an American company whose production facility is at Bay Fortune, PEI. This salmon, engineered to grow twice as fast as a
natural wild Atlantic salmon, may well be the world’s first genetically
modified food animal on the market for people to eat. Right now, the
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Health Canada are assessing whether
its flesh will be approved for our supermarket shelves.
Here at Ecology Action Centre and Living Oceans Society, we believe that the approval for manufacture of this
GM salmon is unlawful under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
We say the Canadian government failed to properly assess the risks,
particularly to wild salmon stocks if this new fish were to escape into the
wild. In fact, government scientists have acknowledged that these fish could
breed with wild salmon. 
Canada’s
federal government has shrouded almost every aspect of its dealings around GM
salmon in acloud of secrecy, denying any public
scrutiny of its processes. Living Oceans and Ecology Action are trying to shed
light on how a genetically modified animal could reach approval for commercial
production without one ounce of public input.
We are
bracing ourselves for what may be a protracted and costly court battle
involving preliminary motions, expert witnesses and volumes of evidence.  We expect this lawsuit and our public
campaign will last for at least a year. Lawyers at the Canadian legal charity Ecojustice
are doing their work pro bono, but all the other costs are mounting up.
So please - - contribute to this campaign and help us reach
our goal. Every donation helps us cover the costs of this court case. 
Help us out!
Tell everyone! Every time you share the news about our
campaign you are helping us to spread the word and reach new supporters, and
that can make or break a campaign. Ask your friends and family to donate and
help put a hold on the world's first GM food animal. And every share, tweet, and

Hundreds of thousands of people lost their homes, even today, 8 years later, many remain displaced, and many areas remain heavily contaminated with radioactive material. It strongly impacted the agricultural sector in Fukushima, on which the local economy strongly depended. Many are reluctant to come back after the Great East Japan Earthquake, the Tsunami that followed, and the nuclear accident. </p><p>However, some have stayed to rebuild their communities and are turning Fukushima into a symbolic place for renewable energy. With the support of local residents, grass-root movements have made community projects in renewable energy flourish in Fukushima. Coming together as a community, they have achieved remarkable results. ISEP has worked relentlessly to help these community projects flourish all over Japan. We would like interns to experience first-hand how the people in Fukushima have built their own community power projects and how they are revitalizing the area. Additional funds raised will go towards the development of community power projects in Japan.</p><p>During their visit to Fukushima, ISEP interns will visit 2 community power companies: Ai Power and Iitate Denryoku, and Tsuchiyu, who have made impressive results. In addition, interns will stay with locals and hear their stories about Fukushima and what they did to rebuild their region.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560830579/ybytjnu5kegged8mh5cv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>Normichi Chiba, founder of Iitate Denryoku together with ISEP interns at Oguni Power plant during their visit in 2018.</i></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>- WHAT IS COMMUNITY POWER? -</strong></h2><p>Community power are power projects where there is a strong engagement of the local community in the power project, and where the local residents are the beneficiaries. Unlike large electric companies, community projects ensure the inclusion and participation of the local community. </p><p>Community power has had prominent examples in Japan and has been an important aspect for introducing renewable energy in Japan. Japan’s history with community power dates back to the 2000's, with one of the prominent examples being in Hokkaido, the North of Japan,where wind turbines were funded by Hokkaido’s people. After the Fukushima accident, community power accelerated, with more than a 1000 community projects in Japan today, with many of them located in the Fukushima area, including Ai Power and Iitate Denryoku. </p><p>In addition, community engagement also ensures that local knowledge is transferred, which is often lost by big developers. ISEP interns will learn more about why local know-how is important in the case of renewable energy.</p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>-WHAT WILL THEY DO IN FUKUSHIMA?-</strong></h2><p>During this trip, interns will learn first-hand how community projects were developed and how communities work together for a common cause.</p><p>The visit will last 3 days, and they will visit Iitate Power, Ai Power, learning about both community solar energy and community geothermal energy. In addition, the interns will have the opportunity to experience the daily activities of local Fukushima farmers, and hear about how they got through the Fukushima disaster, as well as a hot spring hotel near the Tsuchiyu hydroelectric plant and the Tsuchiyu geothermal power plant. The schedule mentioned is tentative, and the activities might change order, depending on the availability of the local organizations in Fukushima. </p><h3><strong>Day 1:</strong></h3><p><strong>Travel from Tokyo to Fukushima</strong></p><p>Fukushima is located around 300 kilometers (approx. 185 miles) from Tokyo. Interns will do the trip by train, which brings them to Fukushima in less than 2 hours. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560909322/sxegqwkacxrmufsoroep.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Tsuchiyu Binary geothermal plant and Sansuiso Hotel’s small hydro</strong></p><p>In Tsuchiyu, interns will learn about the binary geothermal plant which the locals use. This is a sustainable and clean way to generate energy. Japan is famous for its many natural hot springs, which can be used to generate renewable energy, but locals are concerned this will contaminate the hot spring water. However, in this case, the pump has no negative impact on water quality. interns will learn how this is possible. The binary geothermal plant can have an output up to 400 kilowatts, which is a substantial amount for the community.</p><p>Then, the interns will be able to stay at the Sansuiso hotel in the Tsuchiyu area, which uses in addition a small hydroelectricity plant and which can generate up to 140 kilowatts.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560830640/wshhxxxaggmoo9f5nm34.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>ISEP interns in 2018 in front of the Tsuchiyu Geothermal Power plant.</i></p><h3><strong>Day 2:</strong></h3><p><strong>Visit of Ai Power and the Oguni Power plant: </strong></p><p>Ai Power has a very strict policy to only include local stakeholders in their project.

Hundreds of thousands of people lost their homes, even today, 8 years later, many remain displaced, and many areas remain heavily contaminated with radioactive material. It strongly impacted the agricultural sector in Fukushima, on which the local economy strongly depended. Many are reluctant to come back after the Great East Japan Earthquake, the Tsunami that followed, and the nuclear accident. However, some have stayed to rebuild their communities and are turning Fukushima into a symbolic place for renewable energy. With the support of local residents, grass-root movements have made community projects in renewable energy flourish in Fukushima. Coming together as a community, they have achieved remarkable results. ISEP has worked relentlessly to help these community projects flourish all over Japan. We would like interns to experience first-hand how the people in Fukushima have built their own community power projects and how they are revitalizing the area. Additional funds raised will go towards the development of community power projects in Japan.During their visit to Fukushima, ISEP interns will visit 2 community power companies: Ai Power and Iitate Denryoku, and Tsuchiyu, who have made impressive results. In addition, interns will stay with locals and hear their stories about Fukushima and what they did to rebuild their region.Normichi Chiba, founder of Iitate Denryoku together with ISEP interns at Oguni Power plant during their visit in 2018.- WHAT IS COMMUNITY POWER? -Community power are power projects where there is a strong engagement of the local community in the power project, and where the local residents are the beneficiaries. Unlike large electric companies, community projects ensure the inclusion and participation of the local community. Community power has had prominent examples in Japan and has been an important aspect for introducing renewable energy in Japan. Japan’s history with community power dates back to the 2000's, with one of the prominent examples being in Hokkaido, the North of Japan,where wind turbines were funded by Hokkaido’s people. After the Fukushima accident, community power accelerated, with more than a 1000 community projects in Japan today, with many of them located in the Fukushima area, including Ai Power and Iitate Denryoku. In addition, community engagement also ensures that local knowledge is transferred, which is often lost by big developers. ISEP interns will learn more about why local know-how is important in the case of renewable energy. -WHAT WILL THEY DO IN FUKUSHIMA?-During this trip, interns will learn first-hand how community projects were developed and how communities work together for a common cause.The visit will last 3 days, and they will visit Iitate Power, Ai Power, learning about both community solar energy and community geothermal energy. In addition, the interns will have the opportunity to experience the daily activities of local Fukushima farmers, and hear about how they got through the Fukushima disaster, as well as a hot spring hotel near the Tsuchiyu hydroelectric plant and the Tsuchiyu geothermal power plant. The schedule mentioned is tentative, and the activities might change order, depending on the availability of the local organizations in Fukushima. Day 1:Travel from Tokyo to FukushimaFukushima is located around 300 kilometers (approx. 185 miles) from Tokyo. Interns will do the trip by train, which brings them to Fukushima in less than 2 hours. Tsuchiyu Binary geothermal plant and Sansuiso Hotel’s small hydroIn Tsuchiyu, interns will learn about the binary geothermal plant which the locals use. This is a sustainable and clean way to generate energy. Japan is famous for its many natural hot springs, which can be used to generate renewable energy, but locals are concerned this will contaminate the hot spring water. However, in this case, the pump has no negative impact on water quality. interns will learn how this is possible. The binary geothermal plant can have an output up to 400 kilowatts, which is a substantial amount for the community.Then, the interns will be able to stay at the Sansuiso hotel in the Tsuchiyu area, which uses in addition a small hydroelectricity plant and which can generate up to 140 kilowatts.ISEP interns in 2018 in front of the Tsuchiyu Geothermal Power plant.Day 2:Visit of Ai Power and the Oguni Power plant: Ai Power has a very strict policy to only include local stakeholders in their project. In the case of the Oguni Power plant, Ai Power’s largest solar plant, eight local governments, two local companies, five local banks and 47 residents were involved. Here, interns will learn about community involvement and local know-how in Fukushima’s energy projects. Image taken on last year's visit, view on the Oguni power plant from Oguni University.Visit to ""Oguni University"":The Aizu Electric Power Company does not only build power plants, but they also want to raise awareness of the benefits and importance of renewable energies among the general public and children. Therefore, they established the Oguni University right next to the solar park and offer tours to the Oguni Power Plant for everyone interested in it. The ISEP interns will also visit the Oguni university and learn more about renewables. Oguni University is not an official university, but the learning center is nicknamed as ""Oguni Univerity"". ISEP interns at Oguni University, during their visit in 2018.Stay at the local Fukushima agricultural center and meeting with local farmer's about their experience after the nuclear disaster.After a day of learning about renewable energy, ISEP interns will have the opportunity to stay with a local family in Fukushima at a farm. Here, they will have the opportunity to learn about how each family was affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake, the tsunami and the nuclear leak at the Fukushima Daiichi reactor. Although 8 years has past, since the Fukushima disaster, the Fukushima region is far from having entirely recovered. Apart from the nuclear contamination, many areas were entirely destroyed because of the earthquake and tsunami. An estimated 25 million ton of debris and rubble was created, destroying houses, cutting access to electricity and water. Day 3:Visit to Iitate DenryokuIitate village is located about 39 km northwest of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power plant. In Iitate, ISEP interns will learn about the impact of Fukushima on the Iitate village and the response of local residents. In particular, they will visit Iitate Denryoku where they will learn about community power. Even after 8 years after the nuclear disaster, many parts of Iitate remain contaminated with nuclear waste, and the land can often not be used for agricultural purposed. Especially the forests and areas removed from resident housing are still to be decontaminated. ISEP interns will learn about the impact of radiation and the rules of the decontamination processes.ISEP interns in Iitate together with Norimichi Chiba, during their visit in 2018.Return to Tokyo and continuing support to Iitate Denryoku and Ai PowerAt the end of the third day, the interns will return to Tokyo and reflect about their trip. Interns will in addition write a report which reflects their experience and what they have learned. In addition, ISEP staff and our interns will help both Iitate Denryoku and Aizu Denryoku with translations or other services as a contribution to their efforts to make renewable energy flourish in Fukushima.  - THE STORY BEHIND AI POWER -Ai Power was established in 2013 and is located in Aizuwakamatsu in order to make Fukushima a self-sufficient region using renewable energy and to eliminate nuclear energy. Many local businesses in Fukushima were strongly affected by the Fukushima Nuclear disaster. The Yamatogawa Sake Brewery has been no exception. Sato Yauemon’s family has been running the Yamatogawa sake brewery for generations and is considered an important figure in the local region. Website: https://aipower.co.jpSato Yauemon, founder of Ai Power, photo's retrieved from http://www.energy-democracy.jp/751 and https://greenz.jp/2016/11/24/aizu_denryoku/ Depending on rice and clean water resources from the region, Yauemon became strongly concerned with the impact that the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster on the region. Taking his responsibility as a business leader in the region, Yauemon decided to start Ai Power together with the local community in Aizuwakamatsu. Ai Power's Model for community power, retrieved from https://aipower.co.jp/companysummary Last year, ISEP Interns Visited both Oguni University and the Oguni Solar power plant. The Oguni solar plant is Ai Power’s first megasolar project and has a capacity of 1000 kilowatts. Such a large energy plant is generally only operated by large energy companies and is an impressive achievement for community power.ISEP interns visiting the Oguni power plant in 2018.Today, Ai power’s energy production can generate close to 6000 kilowatts in capacity, on the map below, you can see a number of Ai Power’s projects. As you can see, Ai Power has worked relentlessly to increase Fukushima’s energy independency and provide clean energy to the citizens of Fukushima.Ai power projects, photo retrieved from https://aipower.co.jp/business - THE STORY BEHIND IITATE DENRYOKU -          Iitate Denryoku was started in 2014 by Norimichi Chiba after the Fukushima accident. Chiba used to work in a company in Tokyo, but after the devastation from Fukushima, he went back to his home region and to help the Iitate community to establish its own community power project. The aim of Iitate Denryoku is to establish a “Stadtwerk”, a municipal power utility.Website: http://iitatepower.jp/works/index.html  Iitate Village and the Fukushima Nuclear Accident:Iitate village, where Iitate Denryoku is located, has been part of the direct evacuation zone from the Fukushima Nuclear Accident. Even today, a large part of Iitate is part of the restricted area, and residents are not allowed to live there and parts of the region cannot be used for agriculture. Instead, renewable energy projects are being constructed through community power projects.Below, you can see a map showing the areas most affected by nuclear radiation and the areas where people will be able to live again soon, those where you can't live yet and those where you can't stay long. As can be seen on the map, Iitate Village is in the direct contamination zone.  Map retrieved from: http://fukushimaontheglobe.com/the_earthquake_a... Iitate Projects:Solar panels from Iitate Denryoku, pictures retrieved from http://iitatepower.jp/works/index.html  Iitate Denryoku currently has 42 operational plants, from which 14 are solar sharing projects and another 22 projects are currently being developed. So far Iitate Denryoku has made the following projects:- Solar power- Solar sharing, combining agriculture and solar energyRecently, Iitate Denryoku has been working on Solar Sharing projects, combining agriculture and solar energy, in the areas of Fukushima where agriculture has been permitted. Agro-solar combines the agricultural fields with crops and solar panels. In this case, solar panels are installed above the fields, while permitting enough sunlight to penetrate the fields, as can be seen from the image below. Such projects allow to increase renewable energy capacity without taking away agricultural land, highly desirable in Japan where there is a high population density. Read more about Iitate here: https://medium.com/thebeammagazine/solar-sharin... Solar sharing initiative in Fukushima.   - WHY IS THIS PROJECT IMPORTANT? -- WHY CROWDFUNDING? -The Fukushima Disaster and growing evidence of climate change are showing that our current energy system is broken. We need to make the transition to a safe and sustainable system. Too often we think that we cannot have any impact, but community projects, such as the ones our interns will visit, are evidence of how citizen participation has an impact. This trip leaves a lasting impact on how our interns perceive renewable energy projects. It also encourages them, to take this knowledge home and share it in their home countries or in their future jobs, as many of our interns work in climate and energy related industries. We are using crowdfunding for this project, as we believe that as many as people as possible should be able to support these projects. As community power is a community effort, we believe that raising funds to educate our interns is to be equally a community effort. - ABOUT ISEP -Who are we?The Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies (ISEP) was founded in 2000 by Tetsunari Iida and we are located in Tokyo, Japan. Our focus is on promoting renewable energy in Japan and across the globe. We work on a large variety of projects, including providing consultancy services to local communities to develop energy independence, advocacy to Japanese government official, as well as assisting with the development of community projects. In addition, ISEP develops quality research and publishes the Energy Chart, which illustrates Japan energy data. We have a global network, and frequently work on projects with other countries. Last year we worked with the Danish government on biomass and worked with Mali Folkecenter, an NGO from Mali, on solar power . We have also been part in the global community power conferences.About the ISEP Interns:Each year, we welcome interns from around the globe. At ISEP they learn about energy policies, initiatives and get an insight in the real-life challenges of the energy sector, in particular in Japan. This year alone, we have had interns from Germany, Australia, Bulgaria, Belgium, France, UK, Japan and China. We offer them the opportunity to directly work with us on projects, and we continuously benefit from the knowledge they bring from their home countries. ISEP’s involvement in community power:ISEP has worked with numerous community power projects in Japan, and has closely collaborated with Danish initiatives, such as the Samsoe Academy. Some of the examples are both Iitate Denryoku and Ai Power, but also the Hokkaido Green Fund, and the Community Power Association of Japan. To find more information about ISEP, please visit our website: https://www.isep.or.jp/en/ - COST BREAKDOWN -The ideal target is to reach 3040 USD. With each target reached, we will be able to send an additional intern. Please see the details of the cost breakdown below. Prices below, are displayed in US Dollars:* Tsuchiyu Onsen uses a hydroelectric plant, to show support to this initiative, ISEP interns stay at this hot spring hotel. In addition, to show the voluntary support of our interns, 50% of the fee is paid by the interns themselves to stay here.  ** To thank the local Fukushima community power projects, ISEP will offer a free service to them in collaboration with the interns, such as publishing an article or providing an English translation for them. In addition, remaining funds which are not used for the trip will be used towards the development of community power projects in Japan.- TESTIMONIALS -Over the years, ISEP has sent many of its interns to community projects in Japan, including international interns. Last year, 3 interns were sent to Fukushima with a similar visit to the one that the interns will do this year. Their experience shows how Fukushima has impacted not only Japan but countries around the globe. - ABOUT THE INTERNS -This year, we would like to send an international group of 6 interns to the Fukushima area, and spread the word about community power around the globe. We have gathered what some of our interns have to say about why they would like to go to Fukushima and learn about community power.   - THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT -Throughout the crowdfunding process, we will provide you with update on our progress. In addition, once our interns have gone to Fukushima, we will make a report with pictures and share it with our supporters. Please support us by sharing this project with your network, the further we reach the more impact we will have!

<p>Si
 el turismo de aventura es la idea de hacer una cosa diferente de lo que
 había hecho antes, ¿por qué no ofrecer la oportunidad para todos los 
que quieren buscarlo? Alihuen Sendero Accesible es un recordatorio de 
que todos somos capaces de buscar algo más allá de nosotros mismos.</p>
<p>Sin
 importar la edad, habilidad o capacidad, Alihuen Sendero Accesible 
ofrece precisamente eso. El sendero mezcla la belleza de Chiloé con la 
accesibilidad y la inclusión que rara vez se encuentran en muchos de los
 parques naturales de Chile. La granja ecológica Alihuen se construye 
sobre la base de la sostenibilidad, educación y extensión a la 
comunidad, y ha creado un nuevo estándar para la re-forestación y la 
permacultura en Chile (y en el extranjero, también!)</p>
<p>Al hacerlo, 
estamos trabajando para crear un movimiento local impulsado por los 
partidarios locales e internacionales que dan vida a la educación del 
medio ambiente, la agricultura ecológica, la conservación del agua y el eco-turismo en Chile.</p>
<p>Así, en 2016, vamos a ampliar nuestras 
actividades con el Sendero Accesible, que tiene como objetivo desactivar
 la etiqueta de aventura y redefinir lo que el acceso a actividades al 
aire libre significa ... para todos.</p>

</div></div>","Haz click aquí para Español!In a nutshell…If adventure is that idea of doing just one thing differently than you would have done before, then why not offer that opportunity to everyone who wants to seek it? Alihuen’s Accessibility Trail is a reminder that we are all capable of seeking something beyond ourselves.Regardless of age, ability, or capacity, Alihuen’s Accessibility Trail offers just that. The trail blends the rare beauty of Chiloe (Chile’s “Magic Island”) with the accessibility and inclusivity rarely found within many of Chile’s natural parks.The Alihuen ecofarm is built on a foundation of sustainability, education, and community outreach, which has created a new standard for reforestation and permaculture within Chile (and abroad, too!).In doing so, we’re working to create a local movement powered by local and international supporters alike that brings to life environmental education, organic farming, water conservation, and ecotourism in Chile.So, in 2016, we’ll expand our programming to be more inclusive with Alihuen’s Accessibility Trail, which aims to disable the label of adventure and redefine what access to the outdoors means…for everyone.About UsThe FamilyJeroen, Grecia, Gabriel & TamaraJeroen Beuckels is an award-winning permaculture and reforestation advocate, trained chef, father of 2, and co-founder of Alihuen. Originally from Belgium, his love for the outdoors (and sharing them) began with food, and having worked and trained in 7 countries, Alihuen was the next logical step. Eco-farming and ecotourism allow him to combine his love for being in nature, growing, preparing, and sharing good food, and ultimately preserving the environment through the planting of native trees on a large scale.
Grecia Maldonado Barria is a modern artisan, mother of 2, and co-founder of Alihuen. A Chilote (native of Chiloé, Chile) by birth, her woven crafts incorporate traditional Chilote patterns as well as designs of her own inspiration, drawing from nature to use native plant fibers and recycled (found) objects both from the forest and the sea. An advocate for women-driven micro-businesses, Grecia began her love affair with the loom about 7 years ago, and has since participated in exhibitions, workshops, and fairs throughout Chile, where she displays her own craft as well as imparts these skills to generations young and old.

The Farm


Located in the Chepu region of Chiloé, Chile’s “Magic Island” at the north end of Chilean Patagonia, we practice and teach conservation, permaculture, organic agriculture and ecotourism at Alihuen. Through these sustainable approaches to land management, we are returning exhausted pasture land to its native abundance as a thriving forest.
Our goal with the farm is to one day reconnect the forests of northern Chiloé with the large forested areas of the Chepu River and the Chiloé National Park to the south. In the past 7 years, we have planted about 22,000 native trees in an effort to reforest the “lost” forest and connect isolated forest patches to the adjacent national park; creating passages for wildlife.
The Community

From all over the world, the Alihuen community now includes a family of individuals from 15 countries, many different backgrounds and cultures, and multiple interests and characteristics.
15 countries7 projects10 years lapsed9 partnerships
Our community isn’t limited just to the volunteers who come to us through the World Wide Organization for Organic Farming (WWOOF) and WorkAway, but also through international and national organizations including WikingerReisen, FairChile, the Trekking Chile Foundation, the Organization of Forestry Engineers for the Native Forest (AIFBN), Chile’s National Forest Service (CONAF), and the International Dendrology Society.
What unites the community that has grown around Alihuen is an interest in learning and spreading the key themes behind permaculture and sustainability. Using their various skills and talents, these volunteers have each left their mark on Alihuen to make it what it is today.
What Will the Money Do?


We will be conducting this campaign in stages, due to the long-term and on-going nature of this project. As stages are completed here on Indiegogo, we will be able to update donors on the progress of the project and where the money of future stages will go. To give donors an idea of where their money will go now and in the future, the following steps break down our budget.Here’s how we’ll spend the $23,000:$11,000: Eco-friendly trailblazing (literally). We’ll buy treated materials for the path, and work with WWOOF and Work Away volunteers that are a critical part of Alihuen to actually build the trail. $9,500: Production of 16 “experience panels” describing the flora, fauna, and ecosystem surrounding the trail, these will be available in Braille, English, and Spanish.$1,500: Wheelchair accessible toilets$1,000: Prize production costs - buying materials for the handmade local crafts and promotion material like eco-friendly printed postcards. 
EspañolEn una palabra…


Si
 el turismo de aventura es la idea de hacer una cosa diferente de lo que
 había hecho antes, ¿por qué no ofrecer la oportunidad para todos los 
que quieren buscarlo? Alihuen Sendero Accesible es un recordatorio de 
que todos somos capaces de buscar algo más allá de nosotros mismos.
Sin
 importar la edad, habilidad o capacidad, Alihuen Sendero Accesible 
ofrece precisamente eso. El sendero mezcla la belleza de Chiloé con la 
accesibilidad y la inclusión que rara vez se encuentran en muchos de los
 parques naturales de Chile. La granja ecológica Alihuen se construye 
sobre la base de la sostenibilidad, educación y extensión a la 
comunidad, y ha creado un nuevo estándar para la re-forestación y la 
permacultura en Chile (y en el extranjero, también!)
Al hacerlo, 
estamos trabajando para crear un movimiento local impulsado por los 
partidarios locales e internacionales que dan vida a la educación del 
medio ambiente, la agricultura ecológica, la conservación del agua y el eco-turismo en Chile.
Así, en 2016, vamos a ampliar nuestras 
actividades con el Sendero Accesible, que tiene como objetivo desactivar
 la etiqueta de aventura y redefinir lo que el acceso a actividades al 
aire libre significa ... para todos.


Sobre nosotros

La Familia

Jeroen, Grecia, Gabriel & Tamara
Jeroen Beuckels es chef, agricultor, padre de 2, promotor de re-forestaciones y co-fundador de Alihuen. Originario
 de Bélgica, su amor por la naturaleza (y compartirla) comenzó con la 
comida y después de haber trabajado en 7 países, Alihuen era el 
siguiente paso lógico.La agricultura ecológica y el turismo 
sustentable le permita combinar su amor por estar en la naturaleza, 
preparar y compartir una buena comida y en última instancia, preservar 
el medio ambiente a través de la plantaciones de árboles nativos a gran 
escala.Grecia Maldonado Barria es una artesana moderna, madre de 2, y Chilota (nativa de 
Chiloé) por nacimiento. Sus tejidos incorporan patrones tradicionales 
chilotes, así como diseños de su propia inspiración, dibuja la 
naturaleza usando fibras de plantas nativas y recicla objetos, tanto del
 bosque y el mar.Partidario de micro-empresas conducidas por 
mujeres, Grecia comenzó su historia de amor con el telar hace unos 7 
años, y desde entonces ha participado en exposiciones, talleres y ferias
 a lo largo de Chile. Muestra su propio trabajo, así como enseña estas 
habilidades para generaciones de jóvenes y adultos.
La Granja

Situado en la localidad de Chepu, en la Isla Grande de Chiloé, 
practicamos y enseñamos la conservación, la permacultura, la agricultura
 orgánica y el eco-turismo. A través de estos enfoques sostenibles para 
la gestión de la tierra, estamos volviendo pastizales agotados a su 
origen nativo como un floreciente bosque.
Nuestro objetivo con la 
granja es que un día vuelva a conectar los bosques del norte de Chiloé 
con las grandes zonas boscosas del río Chepu y el Parque Nacional 
Chiloé, al sur. En los últimos 8 años, hemos plantado cerca de 22.000 
árboles nativos en un esfuerzo para reforestar el bosque ""perdido"" y 
conectar los parches aislados de bosque al parque nacional adyacente. 
Con este trabajo creamos corredores para la fauna silvestre.

<p></p>
<p>Plastic wastes are not biodegradable, thus even after land-filled, plastics last over
a hundred years, contaminating the surface of the earth endangering the inland ecology
and creating gabage patches in the Oceans, devastating marine
life as well. </p>Dioxins are considered to be one
of the most dangerous poisons in the environment, generated by burning chlorinated hydrocarbons like waste plastics in the
incinerators. Dioxins are suspected to cause cancer, also cause severe
reproductive and developmental problems, and damage the immune and hormonal
systems.
<p></p>
<p>Waste plastics are high molecular polymers
hence when heated excessively, pyrolyzed to low molecular gas and vapors which
condense to oil by cooling. Plastoil is diesel like oil converted from waste
plastics by catalytic-pyrolysis process.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Obviously plastic-to-oil
project is the best solution to prevent massive Dioxin generation from
the incinerators worldwide. It was a policy to develop a
practical plastic-to-oil process in the past decade, but all the projects ended up in
fruitless results. Existing local plastic-to-oil facilities reveals serious
drawbacks; </p>
<p>1)<span> Inefficiency in safety system, </span>causing repeated fire hazards and explosion, threats safety of the operators and the facility.</p>
<p>2)<span>  </span>Low yield
outputs excessive residue built-up which is scraped out manually from the pyrolyzer, exposing operators to toxication.</p>
<p>3)<span>  G</span>as leakage and combustion without neutralization and recycling, seriously pollutes the
environment. </p>
<p>Consequently, local incinerators kept on burning waste plastics, despite the risk of Dioxin generation. Millions of tons per
year of waste plastics are fed to the incinerators in Korea alone, overloading
the costly Dioxin emission control systems.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">At an Exhibition, in
2002, I happen to learn that waste plastics could be converted to oil by applying my professional expertise, which inspired me to develop the plastic-to-oil process
to recycle waste plastics to valuable oil and to prevent generation of Dioxins. I took on  chemical engineering career, since I graduated Seoul National University in 1972,
joined fine chemical company, leading agricultural chemical projects as Project Manager, founded Duretek Inc. in 1995, an engineering company engaged in waste treatment and recycling
projects, as CTO to present.

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>I devoted myself in the development of
plastic-to-oil process ever since, by starting a bench scale test, Plastoil
pilot plant was constructed in Icheon(2004) and consequently in Ilsan(2010). Adopting 40 years of specialty experiences, based on insight into the fail-safe system, determined to achieve State-of-the-Art process,
ensuring operators' safety, preventing pollution, and commitment to save the ecology, fail-safe nitrogen sealed, fully
automated continuous, SCADA controlled, Plastics Catalytic-pyrolysis Recycling(PCR) process
was developed. (Registered Patent KP1180580 2012)</p>

<ul> </ul>
</div> <p><br/></p></div>","Short Summary 





Plastic wastes are not biodegradable, thus even after land-filled, plastics last over
a hundred years, contaminating the surface of the earth endangering the inland ecology
and creating gabage patches in the Oceans, devastating marine
life as well. Dioxins are considered to be one
of the most dangerous poisons in the environment, generated by burning chlorinated hydrocarbons like waste plastics in the
incinerators. Dioxins are suspected to cause cancer, also cause severe
reproductive and developmental problems, and damage the immune and hormonal
systems.

Waste plastics are high molecular polymers
hence when heated excessively, pyrolyzed to low molecular gas and vapors which
condense to oil by cooling. Plastoil is diesel like oil converted from waste
plastics by catalytic-pyrolysis process.

Obviously plastic-to-oil
project is the best solution to prevent massive Dioxin generation from
the incinerators worldwide. It was a policy to develop a
practical plastic-to-oil process in the past decade, but all the projects ended up in
fruitless results. Existing local plastic-to-oil facilities reveals serious
drawbacks; 
1) Inefficiency in safety system, causing repeated fire hazards and explosion, threats safety of the operators and the facility.
2)  Low yield
outputs excessive residue built-up which is scraped out manually from the pyrolyzer, exposing operators to toxication.
3)  Gas leakage and combustion without neutralization and recycling, seriously pollutes the
environment. 
Consequently, local incinerators kept on burning waste plastics, despite the risk of Dioxin generation. Millions of tons per
year of waste plastics are fed to the incinerators in Korea alone, overloading
the costly Dioxin emission control systems.
At an Exhibition, in
2002, I happen to learn that waste plastics could be converted to oil by applying my professional expertise, which inspired me to develop the plastic-to-oil process
to recycle waste plastics to valuable oil and to prevent generation of Dioxins. I took on  chemical engineering career, since I graduated Seoul National University in 1972,
joined fine chemical company, leading agricultural chemical projects as Project Manager, founded Duretek Inc. in 1995, an engineering company engaged in waste treatment and recycling
projects, as CTO to present. (www.dure.com)

I devoted myself in the development of
plastic-to-oil process ever since, by starting a bench scale test, Plastoil
pilot plant was constructed in Icheon(2004) and consequently in Ilsan(2010). Adopting 40 years of specialty experiences, based on insight into the fail-safe system, determined to achieve State-of-the-Art process,
ensuring operators' safety, preventing pollution, and commitment to save the ecology, fail-safe nitrogen sealed, fully
automated continuous, SCADA controlled, Plastics Catalytic-pyrolysis Recycling(PCR) process
was developed. (Registered Patent KP1180580 2012)



 PCR process features three
unique, outstanding performances comparison to the existing unpractical plastic-to-oil
process;

1)  Fail-safe system comprised of nitrogen-sealed
auto-feeding system, seals off oxygen from entering and keeps hazardous gas
from leaking out the process, aided by SCADA control system, ensures total
safety of the operators and the facilities.

2)  Yield of
Plastoil, conforming to GRM2101 KS specification, upgraded by re-pyrolyzing the
separated wax, adopting its unique catalytic-pyrolysis process achieves 80%.
3)   Chlorine
contaminants in the gas generated by the pyrolysis process is quenched in
the gas scrubber and neutralized, fully recycled to self-suffice the fuel
consumption without polluting the atmosphere.
The prototype Plastoil plant will be installed to evaluate and certify the performance of the PCR
process, to acquire the official approval, which would motivate commercial scale
Plastoil projects to be launched by the local provinces to convert up to one million tons
per year of waste plastics in Korea. Furthermore tens of millions of tons per year of
waste plastics eventually, would be converted to oil worldwide, to clean-up the floating island of waste plastics in the Oceans and to help bring
Dioxin free World to reality. 


































What We Need & What You Get

 

The treating capacity of the prototype Plastoil plant is 50 kg of waste plastics per hour and the cost of the project is $500,000-. It would take about three months to fabricate and install the equipment and three months to test run, optimizing and commissioning, to confirm the safety of the operators and pollution control performances, evaluated and certified  to acquire official approval.




 If the funding goal is not met, the treating capacity of the prototype could be reduced to match the fund, within tolerable level.

Bishop, acting as his own lawyer, has launched an appeal (for which he has had to pay hundreds of dollars already). He didn't know he would also be required to pay for the transcript of the flawed ruling, but he is. That's were you come in. He can't afford this additioanl fee.

Michael Bishop is waging another lawsuit against the Army Corps of Engineers -- accusing the federal government of not giving Texas equal protection under the Clean Air and Water Act, among other things.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The Center for Sustainable Practice in the Arts is a hybrid organization dedicated to gathering and redistributing information about sustainable practices in art making.  This project marks our first initiative to solve one of the major dilemmas of creating art on the ground:  Wasted Materials!  We will travel to Prague this summer to focus on the environmental impact of production at the 2011 Prague Quadrennial and will creatively repurpose the waste generated from this 10-day design conference of over seventy exhibiting countries.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Organizing team members include Ian Garrett and Miranda Wright (co-founders of the Center for Sustainable Practice in the Arts), Sarah Peterson (Production Manager, Theater Artist, New York CSPA Associate), Moe Beitiks (artist, cultural volunteer, and writer for inhabitat, CBOT, and the CSPA), Misa Rygrova (leading researcher on this topic in the Czech Republic), and James McKernan (faculty at York University and Technical Director for the PQ's Scenofest).  </p>

<h3>The PQ</h3>
<p>The Prague Quadrennial of Performance Design and Space is a leading world artistic event – a
presentation of contemporary work in a variety of performance design
disciplines and genres including costume, stage, lighting, sound design, and
theatre architecture for dance, opera, drama, site-specific, multi-media
performances, and performance art. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Founded in 1967, the
Prague Quadrennial has presented work from more than 70 countries on 5

professionals, students, and spectators from all over the world. At the most
recent Quadrennial in 2007, 35,000 visitors came to enjoy installations,
photos, videos, and live performances of work ranging between theatre and
visual arts, as well as more than 500 events, workshops, performances,
presentations, lectures, and discussions. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project will be a significant catalyst for the advancement of sustainability in theater and design.  It is an opportunity to develop a comprehensive case study on community engagement in creative resource management.  As a performance, it will examine the relationship of production communities from around the world to their use of materials practically and dramaturgically.  It will create new methods for distributing large amounts of previously used materials quickly, test the limits of a community's ability to absorb the material, and develop a mode of a working network of materials exchange.  </p>

<p><b>THE CHALLENGE: Raise $5000 for the an OCPS Green Tag website project</b></p>
<p>Reducing energy costs for schools is a focus for all school districts in these fiscally challenging times. The Orange County Public Schools Solar Energy Program helps schools reduce costs by generating energy at nine OCPS schools  and  in many cases, transferring excess energy back to the grid. The OCPS Solar Program, which was started back in 1999, has by the end of June 2014, generated an estimated 2084 MWhrs of energy. This has resulted in savings, at current Florida energy prices, worth $208,400 conserving over 1400 tons of Carbon.</p><p>The Orange County Public Schools Solar program has brought together school administrators, code officials, teachers, students, parents, solar industry professionals, researchers, emergency management and utility personnel to work toward a common goal. It has created a community of solar advocates throughout Orange County and successfully engaged our students in the amazing power of renewable energy. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/849923/files/20140911101241-IMG_7804.jpg?1410455561"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>The money allotted for the maintenance of OCPS campuses is prioritized based on keeping the schools running. The loss of use of our OCPS solar panels does not affect the day to day running  of the schools and has therefore received a very low priority. With virtually no maintenance or priority, the efficiency of these systems can be reduced and eventually lead to malfunctioning. The OCPS Energy Management team estimates that OCPS will need $6500 / year to keep our solar systems maintained. Just as you would get your oil changed and car checked each year, or you would get a physical from your doctor, these solar systems need to be cleaned, inspected, and repaired as well. </p>
<p>In order to keep these donated solar systems efficient and in working order, <b>OCPS would like to create a website that will allow the purchase of Renewable Energy Certificates</b> created from the generation of pollution free energy.

</div></div>","Short Summary
THE CHALLENGE: Raise $5000 for the an OCPS Green Tag website project
Reducing energy costs for schools is a focus for all school districts in these fiscally challenging times. The Orange County Public Schools Solar Energy Program helps schools reduce costs by generating energy at nine OCPS schools  and  in many cases, transferring excess energy back to the grid. The OCPS Solar Program, which was started back in 1999, has by the end of June 2014, generated an estimated 2084 MWhrs of energy. This has resulted in savings, at current Florida energy prices, worth $208,400 conserving over 1400 tons of Carbon.The Orange County Public Schools Solar program has brought together school administrators, code officials, teachers, students, parents, solar industry professionals, researchers, emergency management and utility personnel to work toward a common goal. It has created a community of solar advocates throughout Orange County and successfully engaged our students in the amazing power of renewable energy. The money allotted for the maintenance of OCPS campuses is prioritized based on keeping the schools running. The loss of use of our OCPS solar panels does not affect the day to day running  of the schools and has therefore received a very low priority. With virtually no maintenance or priority, the efficiency of these systems can be reduced and eventually lead to malfunctioning. The OCPS Energy Management team estimates that OCPS will need $6500 / year to keep our solar systems maintained. Just as you would get your oil changed and car checked each year, or you would get a physical from your doctor, these solar systems need to be cleaned, inspected, and repaired as well. 
In order to keep these donated solar systems efficient and in working order, OCPS would like to create a website that will allow the purchase of Renewable Energy Certificates created from the generation of pollution free energy. These Certificates are also called ‘Green Tags’ and will be sold to generate funds for maintaining the Solar Energy System that Orange County Public Schools operates.
The cost of the Green Tag Website is estimated to be $5000.
THE GREEN TAG WEB SITEIn America today, most of the electricity generated is through the burning coal and fossil fuels, which directly contributes to the production of pollution, greenhouse gases, and many believe:  climate change. We understand that the reduction of this pollution will aid in keeping our local and global environment healthy. Through the production of electricity using renewable sources, such as the light of the sun, our goal of reducing pollution becomes a reality. Currently, OCPS utilized nine systems using  Photovoltaics (PV) and solar thermal panels, which produce pollution free electricity and heat.  
GREEN TAGS are called by many names. They are also known as:
•  Green Certificates  
•  Green Credits
•  Renewable Energy Credits (RECs)
Green Tags represent an individual’s support for clean, alternative energy. The Green Tag website which we will develop after the successful Iniegogo campaign will be used to allow members of the public access to purchasing these Green Tags. The Green Tags website will allow the public the ability, in a small or large way, to show support of the production of clean electricity generated on the campuses of our nine OCPS schools. 
Funds Raised
The goal of this project is to raise $5000.  If this Indiegogo Campaign receives more than the required $5000 for the creation of the Green Tags website, the excess amount will go directly into our Green Tags Program. 
The Impact
A successful launch of the Green Tags program will:
Aid in the establishment of the OCPS Green Tags Program which will create funding for maintenance and education: 

Half of the money will go specifically toward the maintenance of the current solar installations and all future installations. This includes paying for repair and preventative maintenance in the following ways:
            1.  Clean Solar Panels            2.  Check the Performance of Solar System             3.  Inspect for Operational Failures and Structural Damage            4.  Inspect for Insect, bird and animal damage            5.  Replace any damaged equipment
Half of the money raised will go directly back to the nine schools who currently have solar installations on their campuses. This money will that goes to the schools will be used for STEM and renewable energy education of the staff and students at the principal’s discretion. If there are additional solar schools added during the green tags program, the money will go toward these schools as well.Provide a unique opportunity for over 11,000 students every year to learn about solar energy and ways that it helps their community and save energy.Help a public school system save on energy expenses and maintain equipment provided to the tax payers that is worth over ($500,000) five hundred thousand dollars.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Richard Francis. I fell in love with Maine when I was a student at Bowdoin College and later, in 1999, I moved there from my hometown, New York City. I bought land and built a house, doing most all of the work myself, with the exception of the foundation. I became an avid gardener and nature lover, always conscious of the need to preserve the environment. I designed the house keeping that in mind – it’s heated with wood; a passive hot water heater keeps us warm from March to November, and we grow most of our own fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago I decided to build an addition to the house and run an eco-friendly and pet friendly Bed &amp; Breakfast. The work has now begun in earnest. I’m a free-lance musician and a composer and the extra income would allow me more time for music. Just as important, doing this would be a way to act on how I think about the Earth and our relationship to the planet.</p>
<p>The reason for this Indiegogo campaign is to enable me to complete the structural additions to allow this dream to come through.</p>
<p>The additions will consist of: 1) Three single or double-occupancy rooms 2) A two-level apartment for larger groups</p>
<p>3) A common room with a wood cook stove/oven.</p>
<p>4) A heated greenhouse where we can produce our own vegetables year round.</p>
<p>5) I oriented the house from the beginning with many roof surfaces facing South and West so we will install solar panels.</p>
<p>     The partially finished addition for the B&amp;B is now temporarily resting on small cement pads. My next step is to put in steel reinforced cement posts create the permanent foundation. The existing septic system needs to be expanded, and I need to buy more lumber, roofing materials, insulation, plumbing and electrical supplies, and appliances.</p>
<div>
<p>          Here is an approximate breakdown of costs:</p>
<p>Foundation--about $3,000 (rent excavator at $250/day, and buy steel and cement)</p>
<p>Septic system--about $4,000  (hire someone to add more pipe and sand)</p>
<p>Insulation--about $2,000 (I install this myself)</p>
<p>Plumbing and Electrical---about $3,000 (piping, wiring, appliances, fixtures: I do the installation myself)</p>
<p>Lumber--about $4,500 (I do the work)</p>
<p>Roofing materials---about 3,000 (I do the work)</p>
<p>Drywall and Paint-- about $2,000 (I do the work)</p>
<p>Misc. such as nails, screws, drill bits, saw blades etc.---about $500</p>
<p>Solar Power: for $15,000 we can provide electricity to the entire building (I do the installation).</p>

The total is $4200 but, we already have invested in some of these expenses using our own savings. We also plan on gathering more money through selling some of our belongings we no longer need and possibly even having a pledge party with our local friends and community.Whatever amount is raised above our goal will go to help pay for my next 4 week onsite build that I must do to graduate from the program.If we do not reach the goal ALL money raised will go to pay for as much of the expenses as possible and we will make it happen somehow regardless.How Earthships Impact The PlanetThey Do Great Work Around The WorldDon't Worry if You're Short on CashIf you want to help out in some other way besides cash, that's no problem.

<p></p></div>","Pristine
rainforest… cascading waterfalls, monkeys playing, butterflies fluttering,
cutter ants marching, birds creating music, ancient Maya ruins… welcome to the
Maya Mountain Marine Corridor in southern Belize.
This is an urgent appeal for our fragile
planet.We talk of conserving the Earth, of reducing our carbon emissions, of “doing
our bit” but what have you done today to
make a difference? If the answer is “not enough”, don’t just sit there with
a frown! You could be part of saving 1,110 acres of tropical
rainforest in one of the most pristine parts of Mesoamerica. You could give
endangered wildlife, such as jaguars and tapirs, a place to roam free from hunting. You could be part of reducing climate change by locking up hundreds of thousands of tons of carbon that may
otherwise go up in smoke. And, because the coral reefs downstream rely on these
forests to filter crystal clear water, by protecting the forest, you
could help preserve the incredible Belize Barrier Reef. View
over the Rio Grande: The ‘Seven Hills Range’ is visible
in the background and in the foreground, you can see one of the ranger stations
of the Toledo Institute for Development and Environment. The land we
seek to purchase lies upstream from here, to the left of this image, and is likewise
carpeted by lush forest.
Our
Campaign
The Toledo Institute for Development and
Environment (TIDE) is a non-profit  conservation organization based in Belize’s
southernmost district, Toledo. We have the opportunity to purchase and protect
1,110 acres of tropical broadleaf forest and we are seeking your support.
The piece of rainforest in question lies by
the banks of the Rio Grande in the heart of one of the world’s
biodiversity havens, the Maya Mountain Marine Corridor in Toledo. The image
below shows a view from the river with the land we wish to purchase on the left
bank.
The Maya Mountain Marine Corridor stretches
from the pristine old-growth rainforest of the Maya Mountains to the coral
reefs of the Snake Cayes (Map 1). It is an unspoiled place that
provides a glimpse into the past, a route back to a different world when
forests blanketed Mesoamerica and the underwater theatre of the coral reef
played out in all its natural glory.
The Maya Mountain Marine Corridor supports no
less than 48 globally threatened or endangered species. At least 20 of these
occur in the parcel of forest we seek to purchase, including jaguar, Baird’s
tapir, Yucatan black howler monkey, keel-billed motmot and the Central American
river turtle, known locally as ‘hicatee’.
Map 1: The Maya Mountain Marine Corridor is made up of the Port Honduras
Marine Reserve and the watersheds of the six rivers that flow into it,
including the Rio Grande.

The purchase of this land will help complete
an important wildlife corridor that TIDE has been working on for 12 years (Map
2). The neighboring land parcels are already managed for conservation.
The sale price of the land is $300,000. Our longstanding
partner, the Quebec Labrador Foundation, and its supporters have already
secured $250,000. We therefore only need to raise a further $50,000 to purchase
this remarkable piece of rainforest. We seek to raise at least 10% of that
total with this campaign.
If we succeed, we will place the land under a
permanent conservation agreement and manage it to make sure the forest is
protected in reality and not just on paper.
If we fail to purchase the land, it will most likely be sold to a developer who will replace the ancient forest with a monoculture of banana or citrus with devastating consequences for the forest and harming the downstream aquatic and marine ecosystems.
Please donate to protect this amazing natural treasure.
Map 2: The 1,110-acre parcel of land that we seek to purchase (highlighted
in red) will complete an important wildlife corridor by connecting conserved
lands owned by TIDE (to the northeast, northwest and southwest) with conserved
lands owned by a private eco-tourism resort (to the west). It also plays an
important role in protecting the Rio Grande, which runs by the eastern and
southern boundaries, and the Port Honduras Marine Reserve downstream.

What you
could be part of protecting
Due to its remoteness, this 1,110-acre parcel of
tropical rainforest has largely been spared from logging and hunting. Ancient
trees still tower above the main forest canopy and wildlife is abundant.
The forest provides habitat to hundreds of
species of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians. TIDE has captured images of
some of its inhabitants using camera traps.
Big cats still thrive in the area because
their prey – animals such as agoutis, peccaries, deer and armadillos – are
still plentiful. A healthy puma like the one above is a sign of a healthy
ecosystem.
The iconic jaguar is a symbol of stealth and
deadly beauty. These big cats share the forest with three smaller cat species,
the ocelot, the margay and the jaguarundi.
Weighing in at around 20 lbs, the ocelot is
about ten times smaller than the jaguar.
Baird’s tapir is the national animal of Belize.
The forest we invite you to conserve forms part of one of the last strongholds
for this endangered animal.
Protecting the forest will also protect aquatic
species, such as this critically endangered ‘hicatee’ turtle. The stretch of
the Rio Grande that runs past the forest in question contains one of the
world’s last populations. Forested riverbanks are necessary to maintain the deep river channel that hicatees require. In the picture above,
TIDE ranger Louis Ishim (left) and terrestrial ecologist Elmar Requena pose
with an adult female they are measuring to determine the status of the
population.
Morelet’s crocodile is another Rio Grande
resident. It is a conservation success story, having bounced back from near
extinction.
As if you needed another reason to donate, there is another huge reason why this forest deserves protection – Belize is home to the world’s second longest barrier reef, the Belize
Barrier Reef, home to thousands of amazing and colorful species, such as this
nudibranch in the Port Honduras Marine Reserve.

Corals depend on crystal clear waters. Sadly, this makes them extremely vulnerable to pollution from the land. When the forest is cleared, soils erode under the heavy tropical rains and plumes of muddy brown water extend out to sea for many miles, smothering corals and killing them.But all is not lost. The Belize Barrier Reef is still healthy compared with most Caribbean reefs and one of the main reasons is that Belize still enjoys 62% forest cover. The Maya Mountain Marine Corridor has 90% forest cover and the Rio Grande has excellent water quality.The river empties into the Port Honduras Marine Reserve, which boasts some of the healthiest coral gardens in the entire Belize Barrier Reef.

regular monitoring to detect threats and patrols to prevent hunting, logging or other harm.

<p><b>Our Mission</b></p>
<p>At Deepthi, we believe strongly that Luxury can be Green and Green can be Luxury. It is possible for us to strike a balance between a luxurious lifestyle and care for the environment. Just because a skin/hair product is of natural or organic origin it does not have to look, feel and smell like goo. And, they don't have to cost an arm and a leg. The technology, the processes and ingredients needed to create truly luxurious products that are completely natural and totally harmless to our environment while being affordable are all available.</p>
</div>
<p><b>Beauty Products and the Environment</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The harm that we cause to our Earth by carelessness is not always as obvious as what the picture of the seals in distress depicts. The synthetic beauty products out there are all full of toxic chemicals like Petroleum derivatives, Parabens etc.,that are bad not just for our bodies but also to the Earth we call our home. To take a specific example, Cyclopentasiloxane, a very commonly used Silicone compound in Skin and Hair Conditioners is associated with 'persistent bio-accumulation in wildlife' in Canada's PBT list and 'tumor causing in animals' by a Dow Corning's report.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Another fact that is very commonly neglected is that many Organic standards ignore the delivery systems (bottles, caps, pumps etc.,). Even the so called 'Certified Organic' products from many manufacturers use components that are made of not only non-recyclable material but also produce fumes that harm the environment during their manufacture.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>How are we different?</b></span></p>
<p>Every aspect of Deepthi's operations is conducted with its impact on the environment in mind. All the bottles, cap, pumps etc., that our products come in are recyclable. Even the shipping materials we use are either fully recyclable or bio-degradable.</p>
<p>The Verdana products have </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>No Petroleum derivatives</li>
<li>No Silicones</li>
<li>No Parabens</li>
<li>No Mineral Oil</li>
<li>No Pthalates</li>
<li>No Sulphates</li>
<li>No Phosphates</li>

<li>No Synthetic Fragrances</li>
<li>No GMO's</li>
<li>No Animal Testing</li>
<li>No Animal derived ingredients</li>
<li>No Compromise</li>
</ul>
<div>Our products are manufactured under GMP guidelines  and are validated under CTFA/ FDA guidelines for Safety, Functionality and Performance.</div>
<div>And, these products have been very carefully priced to make as many converts as possible of the non-believers.</div>
<div><b>Current Status of the Project</b></div>
<div>The first phase of the project has been completed with the launch of our 6 Premium Skin and Hair care products. Organic Certifications under Ecocert as well as USDA NOP standards have been obtained. Efforts to spread the message and actively market the products are underway.</div>
<div>The second phase of the project involves 6 additional products ( Organic Aftershave, Toner, Face Serum etc.,). These products are under development, with the first ones undergoing validation tests. Future development work will include Green Home Care products.</div>
<div>The project has reached a stage where we need a little bit of push from behind to face the headwinds that are typical in an effort like this. </div>
<div>Hence this campaign.</div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The Campaign
We invite you to join us in doing our bit to keep our environment livable and sustainable while at the same time enjoying a healthy lifestyle. This mission is illustrated by our twin motto ""Kind To Your Skin. Kind To Our Earth"". 

As a start-up facing tough competition from the makers of Synthetic beauty products, we are asking for your support in the form of purchases of our Premium Certified Organic products at special prices only available as part of this campaign. While these products make wonderful Christmas gifts, 10% of the funds coming from you will go to a Conservation Charity of your choice. We also ask for your help in spreading this message of ""Kind To Your Skin. Kind To Our Earth"". Please read on for more details. Who are we?                  

                                   
Deepthi Organics LLC, located in Kernersville, NC is a start-up that is certified under both USDA NOP and Ecocert organic standards. This is rare among end-product manufacturers, particularly among start-ups. We just recently launched six Premium Skin and Hair care products and are working on more for launch in the next few months. The Deepthi products come under the Verdana ('verde' = Green) brand name. 
We have been featured on:

                 
                    
                     

                     

                     

Our Mission
At Deepthi, we believe strongly that Luxury can be Green and Green can be Luxury. It is possible for us to strike a balance between a luxurious lifestyle and care for the environment. Just because a skin/hair product is of natural or organic origin it does not have to look, feel and smell like goo. And, they don't have to cost an arm and a leg. The technology, the processes and ingredients needed to create truly luxurious products that are completely natural and totally harmless to our environment while being affordable are all available.

Beauty Products and the Environment
The harm that we cause to our Earth by carelessness is not always as obvious as what the picture of the seals in distress depicts. The synthetic beauty products out there are all full of toxic chemicals like Petroleum derivatives, Parabens etc.,that are bad not just for our bodies but also to the Earth we call our home. To take a specific example, Cyclopentasiloxane, a very commonly used Silicone compound in Skin and Hair Conditioners is associated with 'persistent bio-accumulation in wildlife' in Canada's PBT list and 'tumor causing in animals' by a Dow Corning's report.
Another fact that is very commonly neglected is that many Organic standards ignore the delivery systems (bottles, caps, pumps etc.,). Even the so called 'Certified Organic' products from many manufacturers use components that are made of not only non-recyclable material but also produce fumes that harm the environment during their manufacture.
How are we different?
Every aspect of Deepthi's operations is conducted with its impact on the environment in mind. All the bottles, cap, pumps etc., that our products come in are recyclable. Even the shipping materials we use are either fully recyclable or bio-degradable.
The Verdana products have 


No Petroleum derivatives
No Silicones
No Parabens
No Mineral Oil
No Pthalates
No Sulphates
No Phosphates
No Formaldehydes
No Synthetic Preservatives
No Synthetic Fragrances
No GMO's
No Animal Testing
No Animal derived ingredients
No Compromise

Our products are manufactured under GMP guidelines  and are validated under CTFA/ FDA guidelines for Safety, Functionality and Performance.
And, these products have been very carefully priced to make as many converts as possible of the non-believers.
Current Status of the Project
The first phase of the project has been completed with the launch of our 6 Premium Skin and Hair care products. Organic Certifications under Ecocert as well as USDA NOP standards have been obtained. Efforts to spread the message and actively market the products are underway.
The second phase of the project involves 6 additional products ( Organic Aftershave, Toner, Face Serum etc.,). These products are under development, with the first ones undergoing validation tests. Future development work will include Green Home Care products.
The project has reached a stage where we need a little bit of push from behind to face the headwinds that are typical in an effort like this. 
Hence this campaign.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>NCSU's EcoCAR2 team is a multi-disciplinary team made up of students from North Carolina State University competing in EcoCAR2: Plugging into the Future.  The team is run like a small business, we design and build a vehicle, but also have to manage the team and market the vehicle.  More information about the team can be found at our website:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.NCSUEcoCAR2.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.NCSUEcoCAR2.com</a></p>
<p>or on our Facebook page:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.ecocar2.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ecocar2.org</a></p>
<p>The NCSU EcoCAR 2 team is looking to raise enough money to fund a Mechanical Engineering Capstone Design class next semester.  This last semester the Senior Design class was a huge success.  Through the class we had a battery installation tool, engine bay mounts, and quieter exhaust system designed and built.  You can read more about the previous Senior Design class at our blog:</p>
<p><a href=""http://ncsuecocar2.com/Site/blog.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://ncsuecocar2.com/Site/blog.html</a></p>
<p>This next semester we are looking to have Senior design classes work on the fuel system, the cooling system, suspension, and engine control.</p>
<p>We will have a news report about us on News 14 Carolina based out of Charlotte on December 16th.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to host a Senior Design class we need to raise $10,000.  This money goes to support the class who will need to purchase parts and services.  At the end of the semester there is a competition with the winning team receiving $100 per student, 2nd place winning $50, and 3rd winning $25.</p>
<p>This is a good oportunity for business's looking to get their name out in the community.  We are very active amongst the middle and high schools of North Carolina and attend a lot of green energy events that happen in the Raleigh area.  Sponsorship will also expose your company to industry leaders and government agencies like GM, ANL, Department of Energy, Freescale, dSPACE, The Mathworks, and others. </p>
<p>We have several offerings to reward our supporters ranging from recongnition  on our website to actually being a judge at the final competition or having your logo placed upon the vehicle.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal of $10,000 there are two options we may follow depending on how close we are to reaching our goal.  If we are close to $10,000 we will cover the difference with our budget, but if the gap is too large the money will go into our budget and be used on components we need to finish the vehicle.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>From the EcoCAR2 website:</p>
<p><span>""The competition's mission is a vital one: offer an unparalleled hands-on, real-world experience to educate the next generation of automotive engineers. The competition challenges 15 universities across North America to reduce the environmental impact of a Chevrolet Malibu without compromising performance, safety and consumer acceptability.""</span></p>
<p>This is the second AVTC or Advanced Vehicle Technology Competition that NC State University has participated in.  We are one of the smaller teams and any contribution will help.  </p>

<h3>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Hello, my name is Christian Wilson and every where I look, I dream about being like Indiana Jones and finding buried treasure. </span><br/>
</h3>
<p>From the first time I went SCUBA diving, 20 some odd years ago, I have been fascinated with the thought of finding artifacts and buried treasure.  Whether it's some piece of jade necklace from the orient or gold coins from Spain or France, I want to discover something that's been lost at sea.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Now I live on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, and I've lived here for about 10 years and in that time I've read about and heard about so much stuff that's been lost in this area, that it makes me dizzy.  I've read that the infamous Black Beard the pirate made it this far north and came ashore to have a look around.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I'm asking for funding that will allow me to take 5 local teens and go searching for artifacts and buried treasure on shorelines and underwater up and down the east coast.  My plan is to search at least a dozen shorelines in the geographical area and as much of the adjacent underwater areas as we can.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I've given the IndieWilson campaign a 60 day deadline, any longer than that and I'm afraid the water will get to cold for searching or diving in and around the Chesapeake Bay area.  If I get funded any sooner though, IndieWilson will begin!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If everything goes well, this is something I'm going to do again and again with possibly bigger groups and different locations.  IndieWilson will travel!  I hope to use my past experience as a Social Studies teacher and a SCUBA diver to engross kids in things they usually just read about in the classroom or watch on television, adventure, discovery and excitement.  From finding artifacts and buried treasure to asking, ""Where did this come from""?  Kids will learn about the history of the local area and see how the ocean works in hiding the treasures that have been lost there.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I'm a stay-at-home parent for my three kids, so my income is extremely limited.  Although my sister-in-law has a boat that I can borrow and a buddy who's a certified PADI Dive Master that will volunteer his time, there's still equipment that I'd need to purchase to accomplish this campaign like;</p>
</div><div>
<div>   Metal Detectors, I'm hoping to be able to afford the models that work underwater as well as</div>
<div>   on land.</div>
<div>   Digging equipment,  for when we find something.</div>
<div>   Diving wetsuits and diving masks for the underwater searching.</div>
<div>   Surface supplied air compressor for underwater searching, so they won't have to </div>
<div>   learn to SCUBA.</div>
<div>   Boat fuel, we'll need a boat to get to some of the planned search locations.</div>
<div>   Maps and charts of the search areas.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If I don't reach my funding goal at the end of 60 days, then I'm still taking the kids to search for buried treasure and learn about the environment, but our locations will be on beaches closer to home.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And now some perks for my donors:</div>
<div>For your donation of $5 you will receive a photo of your name written in the sand at a search site.</div>
<div>For your donation of $15 you will receive several pieces of sea glass from a search site and a photo of your name written in the sand at that search site, (before the tide washes it away).</div>
<div>For your donation of $25 you will receive a photo with any message you want in the sand and 1oz. of the sand where it was written, along with sea glass from the shore of the search site.</div>
<div>For your donation of $50 you will receive a 30 minute video of a beach with your name or message on it and sea glass from that shore as the waves lap at the shore to relax to.</div>
<div>For your donation of $75 you will receive your own private beach (sand, sea shells, sea glass and drift wood) built from one of the search sites along with a 30 minute video of the beach it was built from.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>For your donation of $2500.00 or more of the funding, we will donate the first artifact found to a museum of your choosing, if you don't care then we will still donate it, in your name, to the appropriate local museum.</div>

Their alliance is called The International Council of Thirteen Indigenous Grandmothers.  The Grandmothers Council fulfills an ancient prophecy found among many indigenous peoples: that a group of elderly women will come together to save Mother Earth when she is in peril.<br/><br/>Since the founding of the Council in 2004, the Grandmothers have been traveling the globe to spread a message of peace, goodwill and the need to protect Mother Earth.  In response to the prophecy, the Grandmothers have held 11 Council Gatherings and numerous other events in North, Central, and South America, Europe, India, Australia, and Japan. </p>

<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
<p>The Grandmothers' Mission Statement says:<br/><br/>- We represent a global alliance of prayer, education and healing for our Mother Earth, all Her inhabitants, all the children, and for the next seven generations to come.<br/>- We are deeply concerned with the unprecedented destruction of our Mother Earth and the destruction of indigenous ways of life. We believe the teachings of our ancestors will light our way through an uncertain future.<br/>- We look to further our vision through the realization of projects that protect our diverse cultures: lands, medicines, language and ceremonial ways of prayer and through projects that educate and nurture our children.<br/><br/>The Grandmothers are active in many causes on behalf of their communities: they work to prevent their lands being destroyed by illegal logging and mining, to keep their waterways from being poisoned, to protect wildlife on the brink of extinction, to free their youth from  poverty, abuse and addictions, and to halt the systematic genocide of their people and the loss of their cultural heritage. The Grandmothers' work is done through prayers, education, actions, and empowerment, for the healing of our Mother Earth, all her inhabitants, all the children, and for the next seven generations to come.<br/> </p>
<h2>A Global Alliance</h2>
<p><br/>The 13 Grandmothers come from all over the world. They are:</p>

<h3><strong>Why Nepal? Why Now?</strong></h3>
<p>When they first formed their alliance, the Grandmothers vowed to travel to each other's homeplaces until they had gone all the way around the circle. This November, it's Grandmother Aama Bombo's turn to host the 12th Council in Nepal. This Gathering, ""Praying for Peace in the Land of the Buddha"" <strong>puts a strong prayer in motion at a crucial time for our planet, in a place where prayer really matters.<br/><br/></strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Nepal in the Himalayan Mountains"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://myimaginenation.com/images/nepal-himalayas.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"" title=""Nepal in the Himalayan Mountains""/></p>
<p><strong>The 12th Gathering --  in 2012</strong><br/><br/>November of 2012 is on the cusp of what some believe will be the Great Awakening, when the Mayan calendar finishes its cycle in December.  In Grandma Aama Bombo's tradition, this year of 2012 marks the transition from the Age of Destruction to the Age of Truth. May it be so!<br/><br/>This Gathering is the 12th Council Gathering -- but it's not the last. Next year the story will continue, as the Grandmothers begin visiting the homeplaces of their Ambassadors, such as Maori Grandmother Pauline Tangiora in Gisbourne, New Zealand, and Wise Elder Saami Grandmother Laila Spik, in her summer home in the far north of Sweden.<br/><br/></p>
<h3><strong>Save Our Planet</strong></h3>
<p>With each Gathering, the Grandmothers' global community has grown. Their prayers and healings have been experienced by thousands, and their community has become increasingly inclusive and diverse.  But bringing the Grandmothers together from all over the world is costly: each Gathering costs about <strong>$200,000</strong> to organize. <br/><br/>We've already raised over $100,000, but <strong>we need your help</strong> to ensure the safe passage of our elderly Grandmothers, their travel companions, and their translators to the remote land of Nepal. <strong>The Grandmothers hold traditions that must be protected; they carry prayers that must be heard.</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Birthplace of Buddha"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://myimaginenation.com/images/buddha.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"" title=""Birthplace of Buddha - Nepal""/><strong>Currently, the Grandmothers need another $90,000 to complete their funding for the 12<sup>th</sup> Gathering in Nepal. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: all donors of $25 and more will receive a tax-deductible receipt for their donations, since the Grandmothers are a program of the Center for Sacred Studies, a California  501(c)3 nonprofit organization.<br/><br/></strong>With 11 Gatherings successfully completed, the Grandmothers want to carry their prayer to the Land of the Buddha.  Attending a Gathering can be a magical and transformative event - no matter how many people attend, the Grandmothers will pray for them all - no matter how many people come forward for healing, the Grandmothers will welcome them all. </p>

<h3><strong>How the World Benefits</strong></h3>
<p>In this highly significant year of 2012, the Grandmothers are inviting everyone to join the prayer to <strong>Save Our Planet</strong>. ""Grandmother power"" is now a global phenomenon. No longer relegated to the footnotes of history, grandmothers are finding their voices and their power to protect their tradtions and their healing practices, in an effort to ensure the survival of the world for their children, their children's children, and for the next seven generations to come.</p>
<p>The Grandmothers Council has already inspired many other grandmothers, elders, women's organizations, environmental organizations and wisdom keepers to step forward to join the movement to <strong>Save Our Planet</strong>. The world benefits by joining the Grandmothers in their prayer for peace.</p>

<p>Experience the clearing and healing of the 13 sacred centers of the body after applying the Grandmother Plant Oil on the body, which will assist in relaxation through meditation or sleep.<br/><br/>The Flordemayo""s Healing Plant Oil comes from the Grandmother plant. It is a sacred plant. The Grandmothers told me that the reason it is called a Grandmother plant is because it is one of the original plants that taught all the other plants their medicine. When we need teaching and guidance, we think of elders and wisdom. The Grandmother plant is the source we want and need in order to come into this wisdom. As we use the plant, it starts moving through us at a cellular level which helps release and restructure our light bodies.”</p>

<a name=""aama"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Aama Bombo</h4>
<p>Buddhi Maya Lama, who is also known as Aama Bombo (Mother Shaman), was born in the remote village of Melong in the Eastern part of the Bagmati Zone, Nepal, 65 years ago. Her father was a renowned shaman in the Nepalese Tamang tradition. Aama became a shaman in spite of the Tamang tradition that women are not supposed to practice shamanism. In the early days, her father restricted her in every way from practicing shamanism. However, when her father died at the age of eighty, his spirits and other gods and spirits started visiting and teaching her to be a shaman, against the prevailing cultural values of Tamang society.</p>
<p>Today, Aama has achieved great renown in Nepal. She treats around 100 patients every morning at her house in Boudhnath, near Kathmandu. Patients come to visit her from around the country, as well as from India and Tibet. She does not discriminate against those she heals, treating the poorest of the poor as well as the Royal<br/> Family of Nepal with equal dedication and respect. <a href=""http://www.grandmotherscouncil.org/node/46"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><br/></a></p>

<p>Born the youngest of 15 children in the highlands of Central America, Flordemayo was found at an early age – like others in her family – to have the gift of Sight. By age four, she was being trained in the art of curanderismo, which had been handed down from mother to daughter for many generations.

<p><em>Today we live in a forgotten world, crowded with illusions and lacking meaning. So much war, such desecration! All the while, how magnificent the Creation that holds comfort and peace. It contains the elements of which we are created and which make us brothers to Nature. It has the four directions that guide us. So simple and beautiful, it inspired our journey here, in these days now. And in spite of all the war, a spark of hope expands inside us, a message that comes to us from our ancestors, our grandparents, great- grandparents, great-great-grandparents who inspire us with their courage and protect us from all forgetfulness. Through time prophesies have foretold that the moment of humanity’s transmutation would arrive, and that women would be at the forefront of this process. And here we are, bringing our seed.</em></p>

Who Are the 13 Indigenous Grandmothers?
The Thirteen Indigenous Grandmothers are women of prayer, and women of action.  Above all, they are women of wisdom. See the award winning documentary on the Grandmothers "" For the Next 7 Generations""; click on image to see trailer.
In 2004, 13 Indigenous Grandmothers from around the world joined together to Save Our Planet. Their alliance is called The International Council of Thirteen Indigenous Grandmothers.  The Grandmothers Council fulfills an ancient prophecy found among many indigenous peoples: that a group of elderly women will come together to save Mother Earth when she is in peril.Since the founding of the Council in 2004, the Grandmothers have been traveling the globe to spread a message of peace, goodwill and the need to protect Mother Earth.  In response to the prophecy, the Grandmothers have held 11 Council Gatherings and numerous other events in North, Central, and South America, Europe, India, Australia, and Japan.

 After 11 successful Gatherings that have resulted in worldwide support for their prayer for peace, the Grandmothers are seeking funds to hold their 12th Council Gathering, ""Praying for Peace in the Land of the Buddha"", scheduled for November 8-11, 2012 in Kathmandu, Nepal.

Mission Statement
The Grandmothers' Mission Statement says:- We represent a global alliance of prayer, education and healing for our Mother Earth, all Her inhabitants, all the children, and for the next seven generations to come.- We are deeply concerned with the unprecedented destruction of our Mother Earth and the destruction of indigenous ways of life. We believe the teachings of our ancestors will light our way through an uncertain future.- We look to further our vision through the realization of projects that protect our diverse cultures: lands, medicines, language and ceremonial ways of prayer and through projects that educate and nurture our children.The Grandmothers are active in many causes on behalf of their communities: they work to prevent their lands being destroyed by illegal logging and mining, to keep their waterways from being poisoned, to protect wildlife on the brink of extinction, to free their youth from  poverty, abuse and addictions, and to halt the systematic genocide of their people and the loss of their cultural heritage. The Grandmothers' work is done through prayers, education, actions, and empowerment, for the healing of our Mother Earth, all her inhabitants, all the children, and for the next seven generations to come. 
A Global Alliance
The 13 Grandmothers come from all over the world. They are:
 
 
Aama Bombo (Tamang - Nepal), Agnes Baker-Pilgrim (Elected Chairperson - Takelma, Confederated Tribes of Siletz - Grants Pass, Oregon, USA), Beatrice Long-Visitor Holy Dance (Oglala Lakota - Black Hills, South Dakota, USA),  Bernadette Rebienot (Omyene - Gabon, Africa),  Clara Shinobu Iura (Amazonian Rainforest, Brazil), Flordemayo (Mayan - Highlands of Central America/ New Mexico), Julieta Casimiro (Mazatec - Huautla de Jimenez, Mexico), Margaret Behan (Arapaho/Cheyenne - Montana, USA), Maria Alice Campos-Freire (Amazonian Rainforest, Brazil), Mona Polacca (Hopi/Havasupai/Tewa - Arizona), Rita Pitka Blumenstein (Yup’ik - Alaskan Tundra, USA), Rita Long-Visitor Holy Dance (Oglala Lakota - Black Hills, South Dakota, USA), Tsering Dolma Gyaltong (Tibetan)
The 13 Grandmothers full bios can be found here. 
Why Nepal? Why Now?
When they first formed their alliance, the Grandmothers vowed to travel to each other's homeplaces until they had gone all the way around the circle. This November, it's Grandmother Aama Bombo's turn to host the 12th Council in Nepal. This Gathering, ""Praying for Peace in the Land of the Buddha"" puts a strong prayer in motion at a crucial time for our planet, in a place where prayer really matters.

The 12th Gathering --  in 2012November of 2012 is on the cusp of what some believe will be the Great Awakening, when the Mayan calendar finishes its cycle in December.  In Grandma Aama Bombo's tradition, this year of 2012 marks the transition from the Age of Destruction to the Age of Truth. May it be so!This Gathering is the 12th Council Gathering -- but it's not the last. Next year the story will continue, as the Grandmothers begin visiting the homeplaces of their Ambassadors, such as Maori Grandmother Pauline Tangiora in Gisbourne, New Zealand, and Wise Elder Saami Grandmother Laila Spik, in her summer home in the far north of Sweden.
Save Our Planet
With each Gathering, the Grandmothers' global community has grown. Their prayers and healings have been experienced by thousands, and their community has become increasingly inclusive and diverse.  But bringing the Grandmothers together from all over the world is costly: each Gathering costs about $200,000 to organize. We've already raised over $100,000, but we need your help to ensure the safe passage of our elderly Grandmothers, their travel companions, and their translators to the remote land of Nepal. The Grandmothers hold traditions that must be protected; they carry prayers that must be heard.
Currently, the Grandmothers need another $90,000 to complete their funding for the 12th Gathering in Nepal. 
Note: all donors of $25 and more will receive a tax-deductible receipt for their donations, since the Grandmothers are a program of the Center for Sacred Studies, a California  501(c)3 nonprofit organization.With 11 Gatherings successfully completed, the Grandmothers want to carry their prayer to the Land of the Buddha.  Attending a Gathering can be a magical and transformative event - no matter how many people attend, the Grandmothers will pray for them all - no matter how many people come forward for healing, the Grandmothers will welcome them all. 

How the World Benefits
In this highly significant year of 2012, the Grandmothers are inviting everyone to join the prayer to Save Our Planet. ""Grandmother power"" is now a global phenomenon. No longer relegated to the footnotes of history, grandmothers are finding their voices and their power to protect their tradtions and their healing practices, in an effort to ensure the survival of the world for their children, their children's children, and for the next seven generations to come.
The Grandmothers Council has already inspired many other grandmothers, elders, women's organizations, environmental organizations and wisdom keepers to step forward to join the movement to Save Our Planet. The world benefits by joining the Grandmothers in their prayer for peace.

In most cultures, women and elders are the caretakers of the family and the protectors of the children and children's children. It is no wonder these elderly women are standing up and taking a leading role to make a difference. If we do not act now to help Save Mother Earth, what will happen to our children’s children?

 Claim this Perk -  Flordemayo""s Healing Plant Oil


Experience the clearing and healing of the 13 sacred centers of the body after applying the Grandmother Plant Oil on the body, which will assist in relaxation through meditation or sleep.The Flordemayo""s Healing Plant Oil comes from the Grandmother plant. It is a sacred plant. The Grandmothers told me that the reason it is called a Grandmother plant is because it is one of the original plants that taught all the other plants their medicine. When we need teaching and guidance, we think of elders and wisdom. The Grandmother plant is the source we want and need in order to come into this wisdom. As we use the plant, it starts moving through us at a cellular level which helps release and restructure our light bodies.”

Grandmother Bios


Aama Bombo
Buddhi Maya Lama, who is also known as Aama Bombo (Mother Shaman), was born in the remote village of Melong in the Eastern part of the Bagmati Zone, Nepal, 65 years ago. Her father was a renowned shaman in the Nepalese Tamang tradition. Aama became a shaman in spite of the Tamang tradition that women are not supposed to practice shamanism. In the early days, her father restricted her in every way from practicing shamanism. However, when her father died at the age of eighty, his spirits and other gods and spirits started visiting and teaching her to be a shaman, against the prevailing cultural values of Tamang society.
Today, Aama has achieved great renown in Nepal. She treats around 100 patients every morning at her house in Boudhnath, near Kathmandu. Patients come to visit her from around the country, as well as from India and Tibet. She does not discriminate against those she heals, treating the poorest of the poor as well as the Royal Family of Nepal with equal dedication and respect. 
 


Agnes Baker-Pilgrim
We grandmothers have come from far and wide to speak the knowledge we hold inside. In many languages we have been told it is time to make the right changes for our families, for the lands we love. We can be the voice for the voiceless. We are at the threshold. We are going to see change. If we can create the vision in our heart, it will spread. As bringers of light, we have no choice but to join together. As women of wisdom we cannot be divided. When the condor meets the eagle—thunderbirds come home.
The oldest living member of her tribe, the Takelma Indians, originally from Southern Oregon. Agnes is a world renowned spiritual leader, member of the Historic Society and keeper of the Sacred Salmon Ceremony. 
 

Beatrice Long-Visitor Holy Dance
We are here with a prayer for our generations, for our grandchildren who are suffering, for our children’s grandchildren. How are we going to survive? Our government is taking everything from us. Our people want our Black Hills back. The only way to survive is through prayer.

Beatrice is a member of the Council of Language Elders, focusing on Oglala Lakota language immersion and teaching their native tongue to children and to elders. 

Bernadette Rebienot
Nothing happens in my country without consulting the women. Our wise people, our elders, they are like libraries. We consult them whenever we need to make large decisions. Every five years, in my country, it is the women who make a peace march. It is the grandmothers who for one month go into the forest to prepare for this peace march. They fast, they pray and invoke the ancestors. When the grandmothers speak, the president listens.
Born in Libreville, Gabon of the Omyene linguistic community, widow and mother of ten, grandmother of twenty-three. Before retiring, Bernadette worked as an educator and school administrator.

 Clara Shinobu Iura
In these latest times we live in, when killing seems almost natural, we are here in these days of prayer so that we can illuminate a consciousness for this planet that is in agony. Inside our hearts, I believe each of us present at this gathering feels great hope. This is a seed being planted.

Humanity is at a crossroads, we can only go one way, as one can’t go in two directions at the same time. We do not know what we need to do as a human species, there is only one place to go and that is into the light, as one tribe. 


Julieta Casimiro
We need to keep hope alive. It is like a never-ending story. In my village there is violence. What is happening in my village is happening in the world. At this moment, we need our faith. We need to make that faith stronger so we can continue doing our spiritual work and continue helping others.

Maria Alice Campos-Freire
 
Today we live in a forgotten world, crowded with illusions and lacking meaning. So much war, such desecration! All the while, how magnificent the Creation that holds comfort and peace. It contains the elements of which we are created and which make us brothers to Nature. It has the four directions that guide us. So simple and beautiful, it inspired our journey here, in these days now. And in spite of all the war, a spark of hope expands inside us, a message that comes to us from our ancestors, our grandparents, great- grandparents, great-great-grandparents who inspire us with their courage and protect us from all forgetfulness. Through time prophesies have foretold that the moment of humanity’s transmutation would arrive, and that women would be at the forefront of this process. And here we are, bringing our seed.
 
In the church of the Eclectic Cult of the Santo Daime, spiritual leaders are called “padrinhos” (godfathers) and “madrinhas” (godmothers).

Founder of Centro Medicina do Floresta (Forest Medicine Center), where, since 1989, she develops research and healings with the plants of the Amazon, as well as education of children and youngsters for the preservation of Nature and sustainable development. A member of the Alliance of Peoples of the Rainforest, she is an activist in the defense of their traditions and patrimony.


Mona Polacca
Indigenous people have come through a time of great struggle, a time of darkness. The way I look at it is like the nature of a butterfly. In the cocoon, a place of darkness, the creature breaks down into a fluid and then a change, a transformation, takes place. When it is ready and in its own time, it begins to move and develop a form that stretches and breaks away from this cocoon and emerges into this world, into life, as a beautiful creature.
We grandmothers, we have emerged from that darkness, see this beauty, see each other and reach out to the world with open arms, with love, hope, compassion, faith and charity.
Mona, a Hopi/Havasupai /Tewa elder, has a Master of Social Work degree. She serves on several United Nations committees on indigenous people's issues and is a featured author, speaker, and educator on indigenous people's human rights, aging, mental health, addiction and violence. She is also the President/CEO and faculty of the Turtle Island Project, a non-profit program that promotes a vision of wellness by providing trans-cultural training to individuals, families, and healthcare professionals. 

Rita Pitka Blumenstein
The past is not a burden; it is a scaffold which brought us to this day. We are free to be who we are—to create our own life out of our past and out of the present. We are our ancestors. When we can heal ourselves, we also heal our ancestors, our grandmothers, our grandfathers and our children. When we heal ourselves, we heal Mother Earth.

Tsering Dolma Gyaltong
I’d like to talk about problems in the world and what the sources of these problems are. I am Tibetan, so I will speak about the situation in Tibet, which affects all of us. Tibetans took very good care of the land, but now it is becoming a place where radioactive waste from products all over the world is being buried. It is a danger for everyone.
Tsering Dolma was born in Tibet in 1929. Because of the Communist invasion of Tibet, she escaped along with her family from Tibet in 1958 to India. In 1972, she and her family (four children) came to Canada as refugees. She returned to India and became one of the founding members who revived the Tibetan Women’s Association (TWA).During the next ten years, she served as an executive member of TWA and established over 30 branch offices worldwide. In 1995, Tsering Dolma attended the Fourth World Women’s Conference held in Beijing, China. She faced many threats and dangers as she along with others openly criticized the Chinese government and its treatment of the Tibetan people and especially Tibetan women. She now resides in Toronto and remains as an advisor to the TWA.

About Mother Nature's Ambassadors
Since Mother Nature cannot speak for herself, we hereby symbolically appointed four guardian spirits to act as emissaries for IMAGINE NATION, which are the four Tamas: Peace-tama, Love-tama, Music-tama, and Earth-tama. Tama (たま) in Japanese means perfect/jewel and in Native American language means thunderbolt. The mascots will go to schools, to the UN, to TV shows and around the world to promote peace and the protection of Mother Earth. For the next generation of children, we want them to know peace and about the blessings from Mother Earth.

Ambassador Music-Tama is a noble white Siberian saber tooth tiger cub prince born along the borders of Russia and China. He is the only one born from his tribe in the last 30 million years.

<p></p></div>","INTRODUCTION

                                   

            The Wireless Safety Group is Asking for Your Help With Our Efforts to Hold Cellular Service Providers Accountable for High Levels of RF Radiation Generated by Their Wireless Facilities: 
            We believe that over time, this form of environmental pollution will take a terrible toll on our health and economy if we fail to take action now.  Industry experts claim that it will be necessary to install cellular base stations within a one to three mile radius of each other in order to serve customers in large metropolitan areas like San Francisco (where there are approximately 850 installations and more being approved monthly).   
            Although the City predicted there would be approximately 350 base stations installed over a ten-year period (from 1996), it is clear that demand for cellular services has exceeded everyone’s expectations.  This is a pattern across the United States that is expected to continue into the foreseeable future. 
 







HEALTH CONCERNS


          


              If we lived in a perfect world where people did not have health problems, there would be less concern about RF radiation exposure. However, in reality, people do have medical issues, and they are not being vetted when cellular base stations are proposed. In fact, RF radiation levels that may be considered safe for some people may be a serious problem for others.
             Children are a good example: their immune systems are not fully developed until they reach their late teens. As a result, they are more susceptible to environmental pollutants like RF radiation. The same is true of pregnant women and their unborn children. The elderly also suffer from compromised immune systems (due to the aging process), and are more vulnerable. 
            In addition to immune system deficiency, there is also a matter of neurobehavioral problems that may be attributed to this type of environmental pollution. Many doctors and scientists believe that the sharp rise in autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and other maladies is associated with wireless technology. 
            There is also concern about other reactions to RF radiation that may include memory loss, mood disorders, sleep problems and impaired cognitive functions.  Some people associate these issues with living near cellular base stations while others may not have considered the possible connection.   
            Sadly, most people do not have a choice of whether a cellular base station will be installed in their neighborhood or on a building close to where they work.  Individuals can limit their use of cell phones and other wireless devices to reduce RF radiation exposure as a precautionary measure, but people living and working next to cellular base stations do not have that option.




 
WHY THE WIRELESS SAFETY GROUP WAS FORMED

                               


            According to the FCC, when the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was enacted by Congress, cellular base stations were typically operating at 100 to 200 watts effective radiated power.  This was considered a relatively low level, and people were not overly concerned about possible health effects from RF radiation exposure created by the wireless technology. Today, however, many cellular base stations run as much as 6,000 to 10,000 watts of power in order to provide service to customers in densely populated areas.
    
            Unfortunately, government agencies are not looking at the cumulative effect of this radiation, and the industry is telling people not to worry about it because it is perfectly safe.  We do not agree with the service providers’ claim, and believe it is time to question the environmental impact of this emerging technology.   
            We plan to establish a better metric for measuring and monitoring RF radiation levels to ensure that the public is safe from long-term exposure.  We believe that this is necessary because current FCC guidelines are outdated and no longer apply to the new wireless services.  Even the scientific community admits that there is uncertainty about the possible consequences.  Our goal is to make sure that service providers only use the actual amount of power needed to serve their customers rather than trying to dominate the marketplace by outdoing their competitors.   




WHO WE ARE
            We have been working on consumer issues involving the telecommunications industry for more than 40 years.  David Wilner (President of the Wireless Safety Group) founded Consumers’ Lobby Against Monopolies (CLAM) in the early 1970s to challenge unlawful utility activities.  This included a successful argument before the California Supreme Court that resulted in a landmark decision allowing consumer advocates to receive attorney fees in complaint cases before the California Public Utilities Commission when that agency fails to act in the public interest.  As a result, an advocates’ trust fund was created to encourage public participation in regulatory matters. 
            We have also been involved in a number of successful appeals before the FCC concerning telecommunications funding for large school districts as well as other regulatory cases involving disputes with common carriers.  Marie Wilner (VP of the Wireless Safety Group) has been involved in these activities conducting legal research, drafting pleadings, participating in discovery, and other matters involving public and private advocacy.  With more than 30 years of experience, she has the background needed to pursue projects involving cellular base station issues.  
            We also work with scientists, doctors, and engineers that have many years of experience in this field, and share our concern about health issues facing the general public as well as the potential drain on our health care system due to many illnesses that could be avoided by prudent use of the wireless technology.   





OUR PRIMARY GOAL
            The first step is to warn local government officials about the risks associated with wireless technology, and encourage them to act to strike a balance between consumer demand and a safe environment.  Right now, the focus is on stimulating the economy (which is good), but little or no attention is being paid to long-term health effects.  Local ordinances concerning the siting of cellular base stations must be amended to emphasize the importance of health and safety to ensure that service providers are held accountable for their actions.    
          
            At present, local agencies are reluctant to assess health and safety issues due to a federal preemption that forbids them from considering these matters when they are reviewing proposals for the installation of cellular base stations on rooftops and other locations.  In certain instances, however, some of the services being offered by the cellular companies are not subject to FCC jurisdiction and therefore local agencies do have authority to take these matters into consideration.  This is also true if the proposed facilities fail to meet FCC guidelines -- which we claim is often the case because service providers use excessive RF power levels. 
            This is very important to consider because deferring such issues to the FCC has not been productive.  The agency is busy auctioning frequencies in the radio frequency spectrum to service providers (which has generated more than $25 billion to the US Treasury to date), and they are left to work out private agreements amongst themselves as to how they share those frequencies.   As far as the FCC is concerned, the cellular industry is deregulated, and agency oversight is unnecessary.     
            We are in the process of contacting local decision-makers across the United States to make them aware of this situation, and the need to revise current wireless telecommunications service guidelines to take these things into consideration.  See our Letter San Francisco's Mayor Edwin M. Lee: http://www.WirelessSafetyGroup.com/LettertoMayo....  In addition, steps must be taken at the FCC level to remind the agency that its responsibility is to protect the public interest first instead of being influenced by the industry’s desire to make more money.
 
            At the State level, it is vital that legislators understand all the implications of wireless technology, and why it is important to serve their constituents with the same level of enthusiasm they show the cellular service providers.  Public health has to be first on their agendas, and corporate interest should be second.    
            In addition, public awareness is also very important.  A good start would be the requirement that local agencies post all applications for cellular base station installations (and upgrades) on their Web sites so the public is aware of what is taking place in their neighborhoods.  Service providers should also be required to give notice to their customers (through bill inserts) when new installations are planned.  




 
HOW YOU CAN HELP

                                             


            There is a lot that needs to be done to give consumers a greater say in the future of the cellular industry, and this will require sufficient funding to be effective.  It is important to keep in mind that the cellular industry has unlimited financial resources, top experts, attorneys, and lobbyists to protect their interest (which is making money).  Those that are concerned about health and safety matters should support our efforts to make sure these issues are properly addressed.    
 
            We are currently working with people that are opposed to cellular base stations in their neighborhoods which include reviewing land use restrictions, applications for Conditional Use Permits, RF studies, and compliance reports that are required for approval.  We also question service providers about the type of equipment and power levels they are proposing.  We do these things to ensure that people’s due process rights are protected when land use is considered by local agencies for installation of cellular base stations.     
 
            At present, it is mostly up to private individuals to bear the burden of challenging the installation of cellular base stations.  In our view, it would be more equitable if this responsibility is shared by a larger number of people.   
            
            We rely on contributions to fund our efforts on behalf of the public.  Occasionally, we receive funding from non-profit organizations.  However, with the downturn in the economy, this source has become very limited.  Therefore, we must rely on individuals to help out.  All donations large or small are greatly appreciated.  Please support this important cause.

The Colorado River is the Most endangered river in the United States.  Our Grand Valley Hamlet has created a Movement called Water Comes First. This movement is about bringing awareness to the people about the energetics of Gratitude to elemental beings, such as the Colorado River and the springs, creeks, lakes, the weather and it's rains and snows. </div><div>It takes time, money and great effort to mobilize our people to a different way of thinking. If you give gratitude to someone, you build a relationship with them. This is how it works with water, too. But this is a huge mind shift, to the heart. </div><div>Help us to remember our relationship to this finite being, this gift we call water. Help the weather workers and the Sacred Water Keepers do their part in building awareness of being in right relationship to the source of life.</div><div>We need $2500 to cover expenses of indigeneous weather workers coming here to help us with our ceremonies and work with the water. They are our teachers and we are doing the work from our hearts. If we reach the entire goal we will pay back money that we personally used to fund our Nahuatl weather work teacher to help us work with rain here on the Grand Mesa. We will also be bringing him back to teach us the song of the Colorado River, to build awareness of the need for this type of sacred activism.  </div><div>Since the initial program for Water Comes First and the specific work on the Grand Mesa, a sacred site for weather, we have had rains (since July) and snows that have exceeded our usual annual rainfall. What we thought would be a drought in this specific area was not. </div><div>When the Colorado River reaches Her Mother, the Pacific Ocean again (she hasn't made it to Her in many years) the Ocean will be grateful and begin to send rains again to the Southwest.

The Colorado River is the Most endangered river in the United States.  Our Grand Valley Hamlet has created a Movement called Water Comes First. This movement is about bringing awareness to the people about the energetics of Gratitude to elemental beings, such as the Colorado River and the springs, creeks, lakes, the weather and it's rains and snows. It takes time, money and great effort to mobilize our people to a different way of thinking. If you give gratitude to someone, you build a relationship with them. This is how it works with water, too. But this is a huge mind shift, to the heart. Help us to remember our relationship to this finite being, this gift we call water. Help the weather workers and the Sacred Water Keepers do their part in building awareness of being in right relationship to the source of life.We need $2500 to cover expenses of indigeneous weather workers coming here to help us with our ceremonies and work with the water. They are our teachers and we are doing the work from our hearts. If we reach the entire goal we will pay back money that we personally used to fund our Nahuatl weather work teacher to help us work with rain here on the Grand Mesa. We will also be bringing him back to teach us the song of the Colorado River, to build awareness of the need for this type of sacred activism.  Since the initial program for Water Comes First and the specific work on the Grand Mesa, a sacred site for weather, we have had rains (since July) and snows that have exceeded our usual annual rainfall. What we thought would be a drought in this specific area was not. When the Colorado River reaches Her Mother, the Pacific Ocean again (she hasn't made it to Her in many years) the Ocean will be grateful and begin to send rains again to the Southwest. Grandmother Ocean is forgetting the song of the Colorado River, and therefore, like forgetting the words to any song, She doesn't know to send the rains back to the Southwest.The Colorado River needs your help.

<p>The project started in 2006 when David Solberg, an expert in sustainable energy, started an
international project and concluded that environmental issues such as climate change, water scarcity, and air pollution were the result of the inefficient use of non-renewable resources and excessive dependency on fossil fuels. Due to this, Solberg came up with an innovative methodology that uses the
concept of Exergy. <br/></p>

<p>PATRONS</p>
<p>Seacoast residents are politically, socially, and environmentally progressive — and they want to support like-minded, environmentally conscious businesses. Yet they face a dilemma when they want to eat out or order in. The Seacoast has many local restaurants with amazing food and service, but some still rely on unsustainable practices and environmentally detrimental single-use plastics. We believe the restaurant-going public should not have to choose between enjoying a great meal or boycotting a restaurant for the betterment of the environment.</p>
<p>THE RESTAURANTS</p>
<p>The Seacoast food and beverage industry is a vibrant, growing scene — many of these restaurants, breweries, and cafes want to adopt more environmentally conscious practices, yet don’t possess the knowledge or resources to reach their sustainability goals. We are creating programs to educate these restaurants and provide resources to help them convert away from single-use plastics, helping them protect the places their patrons and community love.</p>
<p>THE EARTH</p>
<p>In the end, our biggest beneficiary is our planet. The environment, wildlife, and our fellow humans will all enjoy a better future when we work together toward leaving the planet in better shape for future generations.</p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Just like everywhere else in the world we have a single-use plastic problem. Plastic bags, cups, straws, utensils, and to-go containers. There are processes that we're all stuck in, the ""on the go"" culture where convenience is the main concern. This way of life is creating a huge plastic pollution problem around the world. It's littering our streets, the oceans, and working its way into the food chain.</p>
<p>The Seacoast community is ready for a challenge, ready to lead the way and set an example of how a community of concerned citizens and committed restaurants can work together to inspire positive change.</p>

Our community has the opportunity to stand as one and definitively support a healthier environment. Let’s do this together.</p>
<p>Sustainable Seacoast is already seeing incredible success. Currently, we have signed on 17 member restaurants that have committed to reducing their impact on the environment, with your help we will continue to convert more restaurants! Our first steps have resulted in new sustainability commitments like eliminating plastic bags and adopting “straw on demand’ programs that will keep thousands of straws out of landfills and our nearby ocean.

<p>First conceived over five years ago and having gone through a series of preparatory testing phases, the Arctic Ocean expedition named descriptively as the Dark Ice Project is one of a kind. Its concept is the work of polar expedition leader Alex Hibbert and brings back into the fray trusted past teammates. George Bullard was Alex's partner on the record-breaking 1374-mile Long Haul expedition and James Wheeldon has worked with Alex in the Greenlandic High Arctic and in Iceland's notorious winter months.</p>
<p>This trio have researched, reworked and optimised their audacious plan to combine genuine, novel and <strong>useful</strong> environmental science with one of the most ambitious exploratory polar expeditions of times past or present.</p>
<p><strong>The Phases of the Expedition</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>BOAT. Launching from some of the northernmost shores of land anywhere on Earth (exact location is currently under wraps), the team will travel north in a modified science craft through the last weeks prior to the onslaught of the winter freeze-up.</li>
<li>DRIFT. Using special equipment, they will set up a floating, drifting headquarters on the dynamic sea ice of the Arctic Ocean. This phase will allow for many weeks of the most ambitious scientific work. All will occur in the darkness of polar winter.</li>
<li>SKI. Once in position and taking into account weather, drift and dozens of other factors, the Dark Ice team then take to skis and complete the final few hundred miles across pressure ridges and open water to the North Pole. Theirs will be the first to reach the North Pole in true winter conditions and without resupplies. They will have lightweight science instruments with them in order to continue their work and widen the sphere of discovery.</li>

<h3><strong>Why we need you!</strong></h3>
<p>As with any major journey, we will be partnering with a series of corporate allies, scientific grants and academic funding bodies. This complex network will ensure that every cog in the machine works on schedule and meets with success.</p>
<p>Of course, funding is tight. It always is, and in the world of polar expeditions, the last decade has made this even harder. As well as highly-specialised science goals with top universities and international environmental institutions, the team are passionate about 'open science' - that is, more basic yet still important data of a variety of types we can publish free, to the public.</p>
<p>This is where you come in. Woven into our journey will be our open science work and we need your assistance to make this as big, and as valuable to all, as possible.</p>
<p><u><span>T</span>he more we raise, the more we can do. Simple.</u> £10,000 is a bare minimum and we implore you to help us smash through that initial target.</p>
<p><strong>Why are we qualified? Why us?</strong></p>
<p>Despite all being under the age of 32, the team have between them nearly a thousand days of serious, independent Arctic experience. They also hold a major polar world-record (the longest unsupported Arctic journey in history). A shared focus is for innovation - not copying previous ventures but instead driving their 'craft' forwards.</p>
<p>The team also bring a formidable scientific background to the table. There is no point doing science if it isn't done properly. The quality of data matters. Two science degrees from Oxford University and one from Edinburgh University will ensure that the surveying will be thorough and the data relevant.</p>

<p>This data will be raw, whilst digestible, and released for free, global use by schools, citizens or higher educational organisations. Open Science.</p>
<p><i>*We can add to this with funding that exceeds our base target - please help us do more.*</i></p>
<p>Why? The Impact? This is clear: Climate Change is still one of the least understood existential threats to our planet, civilisation and the nature we live amongst.

</div></div>","JOIN US TO UNCOVER THE SECRETS OF THE POLAR NIGHT
This unique Arctic science project will involve a multi-phase expedition, culminating in a world-first winter journey to the Geographic North Pole. The preceding months will allow the team to collect an array of scientific data never before possible.
Vast gaps exist in scientists' knowledge of the melting sea ice across the vast Arctic Ocean. Whilst more is learned each year about the changing climate in the sunny season - spring and summer - the months of winter darkness are still a forbidding enigma. 

The Dark Ice Project
First conceived over five years ago and having gone through a series of preparatory testing phases, the Arctic Ocean expedition named descriptively as the Dark Ice Project is one of a kind. Its concept is the work of polar expedition leader Alex Hibbert and brings back into the fray trusted past teammates.

</div> <div> <h3>Why 50/50?</h3>
<p>50/50 strikes a perfect balance between ambitious and realistic energy targets. Right now, the debate over our global energy future is divisive, with oil, gas and nuclear companies pitted against renewables.

</ul>
<p>While the <a href=""http://www.wri.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WRI</a> drafted these policy recommendations for developing world governments, we at the 50/50 Campaign believe they ought to apply to all players in the global energy system regardless of place or politics, as well as to governments in both the 'developed' and 'developing' world.

<p>The 50/50 Campaign website will have three moving parts: a Smart Energy Policies Petition, a Power Map and a Power Blog. We'll also organize a conference AND with your help we'll invest 10% of all funds raised in a UK-based community renewable energy scheme. Together these 5 actions are at the Campaign's core. <br/></p>
<h4>1. Smart Energy Policies Petition: </h4>
<p>The most important part of the website will be the online petition. This is our call to action. Our aim is to collect as many online signatories as possible in support of the 50/50 target and Smart Energy Policies. Those who sign the petition will be making a pledge to put the Smart Energy Policies into practice in how they invest in, produce and consume energy. We don't need to wait for governments to act to build a sustainable future, we can do it with people power!<br/></p>
<h4>2. Power Map:</h4>
<p>Renewable energy SMEs will be rewarded for signing the Smart Energy Policies Petition and linking back to the 50/50 Campaign website from their websites, by receiving a unique place on our Power Map. The Power Map will have a dedicated space on the 50/50 Campaign website, pinpointing and displaying contact information for renewable energy SMEs across the globe who have pledged to put Smart Energy Policies into practice. The purpose of the Power Map will be to show our support for fledgling companies in the renewable energy market by providing them with some free, top notch digital advertising. <br/></p>
<h4>3. Power Blog:</h4>
<p>Power Blog will also have a special place on the 50/50 Campaign website - a place to form the knowledge hub, a one-stop-shop for expertise by some of the world's leading energy investment and sector experts. Power Blog will feature a wide range of original multimedia content and will include opinion articles on renewable energy and investment trends drawing attention to the 50/50 Campaign and providing some thought leadership. Nuovi have the skills and talent to deliver a specialist blog that can make some serious headway in getting the Campaign message out to major market players. <br/></p>
<h4>
</h4>
<h4>
</h4>
<h4>4. Annual Conference:</h4>
<p>We're currently working on organizing a half-day conference for early February 2015 called 'Impact Investing and Renewable Energy: Bridging the Gap.' The Conference will feature expert panelists in impact investing and renewable energy from around the UK, US and globe. We're already busy securing support from our affiliates at University Business Schools and are looking forward to an event that can act as a launching pad for the 50/50 Campaign. <br/></p>
<h4>
</h4>
<h4>5. Community Energy Project: </h4>
<p>We at BlueWorks Global are BIG on community renewables and local empowerment. To demonstrate how people power can lead to a global renewable energy transformation, we're going to put our money where our mouth is by investing 10% of total funds raised for the 50/50 Campaign into a community renewable energy project based in the UK. The community project chosen will be invited to table at our annual conference and to network with investors - which will hopefully help them with raising enough cash to meet their own fund-raising target. We're open to suggestions for a project, so please get in touch with the Campaign organizers if you have any suggestions. </p>

THIS PROJECT: The second sidewalk storybook - Fukushima Response: Chieko’s Story will be produced by a group of local artists and activists on Saturday and Sunday, October 27-28, 2012. We will create the second production of a new art form in color chalk on the sidewalk at Penry Park in Petaluma, California. This 100-foot storybook will contain 12 panels of text and images that are each 8 feet in length. The tale is based on the true story of Chieko Shiina, who was displaced by the nuclear power plant disaster in Japan on March 11, 2011. (See story below.)


We will also create a  DOCUMENTARY VIDEO which will include the production of the 100 foot long storybook. The video will depict artists and volunteers creating the 12 chapter storybook and will include interviews with participating artists, anti-nuclear activists and passersby. This educational, community-building project will help to broaden international support and serve as a cautionary tale about the very real dangers of nuclear power.
Ten percent of the funds we raise for this project will be donated to Fukushima Response. Please check out the website below. http://fukushimaresponse.org


 
“Fukushima Response: Chieko’s Story”This original story was adapted from public speeches by Chieko Shiina who was displaced by the destruction of the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, Japan on March 11, 2011.
By Tim Nonn, Beth Meredith and Eric Storm 
Chapter One
Story: Explosion and evacuation at Fukushima.
Text: Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster: March 11, 2011. As radiation spread, 200,000 residents were evacuated around the nuclear power plants operated by Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO).
Images: (1) nuclear power plant explodes; (2) residents flee in terror.
Chapter Two
Story: Chieko Shiina, a woman who lives near Fukushima, is angry and sad about losing her business and way of life. 
Text: After 3/11 my life was turned upside down. I was shocked to realize I couldn’t grow vegetables without contamination and my grandchildren could longer visit me. Burning contaminated wood was like having a tiny nuclear power plant in my home. (40 words))
Images: (1) Chieko stares sadly at a photograph of her children and grandchildren; (2) she burns wood in a stone oven.
Chapter Three
Story: Chieko faces the hard reality of her life, which had been drastically changed by the disaster. She must decide where to live.
Text: For thirteen years I worked hard to create my home and farm, but now I had to leave it. I was sad and angry. Where should I live? I had the chance to move to an area with less radiation. 
Image: Chieko sits in a garden in deep thought. Above her head are two bubbles. One shows a nice way of life far away from Fukushima. The other shows her daughter and two grandchildren in the devastated city of Fukushima. 
Chapter Four

The movement’s vision became “to call on all people to join in a peaceful revolution, to honor Indigenous sovereignty, and to protect the land and water.” This movement continues to grow while providing support for Indigenous issues worldwide, such as Protecting Mauna Kea, Stopping Bill C-51, and Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and Two-Spirit Peoples.(MMIWG2S). As we continue to grow and move forward, more than ever we must focus on, and work with, solutions that will help create the change necessary and ensure the sustainability of future generations. <br/><br/>Goal: Our goal is to present at the Healing Our Spirit Worldwide conference being held November 15-19, 2015, in Hamilton, New Zealand. The conference attracts Indigenous elders, academics, and youth from around the world by providing a platform that allows them to share their unique Indigenous worldviews. <br/><br/>Our presentation will use a solution-focused approach through nehiyaw and Anishinaabe laws.  We will focus on food sovereignty and reclaiming our traditional ways to eating and living a healthy way of life. Our message is to learn to live off the land, become self-sustainable, and empower our communities to self-determination.<br/><br/>Our workshop proposal has been accepted by the conference committee. Now we need your support to help us get there. <br/> <br/>Presenters<br/>Sylvia McAdam (Saysewahum) is a nehiyaw lawyer and a co-founder of the Indigenous-led global movement Idle No More. She received a Law Degree from the University of Saskatchewan and a Human Justice Degree from the University of Regina. She is an advocate for Treaty, a speaker, an author, and a direct descendant of Treaty peoples. She recently released her book Nationhood Interrupted: Revitalizing nêhiyaw Legal System.<br/><br/>“Healing our Spirit Worldwide needs to hear our Indigenous voices to represent as Idle No More organizers. We believe we will bring a unique perspective by explaining that when we say “healing” we must also speak on behalf of those that have no voice; the animals, plants, waters, winged ones, and so forth, who are our relatives need healing as well. We have incorporated and interwoven their struggles in terms of land devastations, water contamination, and air pollution. Human healing is one aspect of a much bigger healing and protecting in this pivotal time in which all of creation faces a catastrophe. Our actions will unfold the future.”<br/><br/>Shawn Johnston is a Two-Spirit Anishinaabe originally from Couchiching First Nations located in Treaty #3 Territory.  He recently graduated with his Masters in Social Work from Wilfrid Laurier University. He is currently the Events Coordinator for the Waterloo Aboriginal Education Centre located at the University of Waterloo. Shawn was recently honoured by Western University as the recipient of its Young Alumni Award. He accepts the award this fall.  <br/><br/>“Being an organizer for Idle No More has allowed me to find my own voice and help advocate for others. It is my goal to continue educating others within my community about issues impacting the First Peoples of Turtle Island. I complete this work for my nieces and nephews, as well their children. I have felt the impact that assimilation by a so-called “government” has had on my community. I do not want to see this happen for our future generations and will do what I can to help protect the generations of today. There is so much work that we still need to do and in order for change to take place, we need to do this together.”<br/><br/>Where will the funds go?<br/>The funds raised will help cover costs of our registration, travel, and meals for the duration of our stay. We estimate a total of $8280 is needed for both of us to attend this international gathering. <br/> <br/>Return travel: Saskatoon, Canada, to Hamilton, New Zealand (Sylvia McAdam) $2250<br/>Return travel: Toronto, Canada to Hamilton, New Zealand (Shawn Johnston) $2250<br/>Accommodations for four nights $2000<br/>Meals for five days ($40/day/person) $400<br/>Registration ($690/person) $1380<br/><br/>TOTAL $8280<br/><br/>Impact:<br/>The impact of Sylvia and Shawn’s involvement in this conference will be felt both by other conference attendees in Hamilton, New Zealand, and by members of their respective home communities. As leaders in both the global Idle No More movement and their local communities, Sylvia and Shawn will bring to the conference important grassroots understandings of the issues faced by Indigenous peoples on Turtle Island.  This insight will contribute to and deepen the discussions at the international Healing Our Spirit Worldwide conference. In addition, the learning and relationships that Sylvia and Shawn will have the opportunity to develop while at the conference will contribute to their work in their home communities.</p></div>","Boozhoo, Tansi, Hello,Over three years ago, the Idle No More movement emerged and drew worldwide attention to issues impacting not only Indigenous people, but everyone living on Mother Earth.

As we continue to grow and move forward, more than ever we must focus on, and work with, solutions that will help create the change necessary and ensure the sustainability of future generations. Goal: Our goal is to present at the Healing Our Spirit Worldwide conference being held November 15-19, 2015, in Hamilton, New Zealand. The conference attracts Indigenous elders, academics, and youth from around the world by providing a platform that allows them to share their unique Indigenous worldviews. Our presentation will use a solution-focused approach through nehiyaw and Anishinaabe laws.  We will focus on food sovereignty and reclaiming our traditional ways to eating and living a healthy way of life. Our message is to learn to live off the land, become self-sustainable, and empower our communities to self-determination.Our workshop proposal has been accepted by the conference committee. Now we need your support to help us get there.  PresentersSylvia McAdam (Saysewahum) is a nehiyaw lawyer and a co-founder of the Indigenous-led global movement Idle No More. She received a Law Degree from the University of Saskatchewan and a Human Justice Degree from the University of Regina. She is an advocate for Treaty, a speaker, an author, and a direct descendant of Treaty peoples. She recently released her book Nationhood Interrupted: Revitalizing nêhiyaw Legal System.“Healing our Spirit Worldwide needs to hear our Indigenous voices to represent as Idle No More organizers. We believe we will bring a unique perspective by explaining that when we say “healing” we must also speak on behalf of those that have no voice; the animals, plants, waters, winged ones, and so forth, who are our relatives need healing as well. We have incorporated and interwoven their struggles in terms of land devastations, water contamination, and air pollution. Human healing is one aspect of a much bigger healing and protecting in this pivotal time in which all of creation faces a catastrophe. Our actions will unfold the future.”Shawn Johnston is a Two-Spirit Anishinaabe originally from Couchiching First Nations located in Treaty #3 Territory.  He recently graduated with his Masters in Social Work from Wilfrid Laurier University. He is currently the Events Coordinator for the Waterloo Aboriginal Education Centre located at the University of Waterloo. Shawn was recently honoured by Western University as the recipient of its Young Alumni Award. He accepts the award this fall.  “Being an organizer for Idle No More has allowed me to find my own voice and help advocate for others. It is my goal to continue educating others within my community about issues impacting the First Peoples of Turtle Island. I complete this work for my nieces and nephews, as well their children. I have felt the impact that assimilation by a so-called “government” has had on my community. I do not want to see this happen for our future generations and will do what I can to help protect the generations of today. There is so much work that we still need to do and in order for change to take place, we need to do this together.”Where will the funds go?The funds raised will help cover costs of our registration, travel, and meals for the duration of our stay. We estimate a total of $8280 is needed for both of us to attend this international gathering.  Return travel: Saskatoon, Canada, to Hamilton, New Zealand (Sylvia McAdam) $2250Return travel: Toronto, Canada to Hamilton, New Zealand (Shawn Johnston) $2250Accommodations for four nights $2000Meals for five days ($40/day/person) $400Registration ($690/person) $1380TOTAL $8280Impact:The impact of Sylvia and Shawn’s involvement in this conference will be felt both by other conference attendees in Hamilton, New Zealand, and by members of their respective home communities. As leaders in both the global Idle No More movement and their local communities, Sylvia and Shawn will bring to the conference important grassroots understandings of the issues faced by Indigenous peoples on Turtle Island.  This insight will contribute to and deepen the discussions at the international Healing Our Spirit Worldwide conference. In addition, the learning and relationships that Sylvia and Shawn will have the opportunity to develop while at the conference will contribute to their work in their home communities.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>We need your
help to save New Zealand’s largest organic heritage or heirloom Seed and Tree
collection by 6<sup>th</sup> June 2014. We are asking for your support for this
campaign to secure the land the New Zealand organic heritage seed collection
grows on before we lose it.</p>
<p><b>Background: 30 years of organic heritage seed
saving</b></p>
<p>Koanga
Institute founded by Kay Baxter has spent 30 years building up a living
library comprising of hundreds of heritage fruit and vegetables that are in
danger of extinction and being lost. <i><b>These seeds are either from New Zealand or
brought here from England, Scotland, Croatia, Germany, France, South Africa,
pacific islands and other parts of the world with our ancestors when they
settled in New Zealand. Some of the seed lines do not exist any longer in their
country of origin.</b></i></p>Kay says ‘Old people who sent us in
their sacred seeds 30 years ago understood the sacredness of
their seeds, that had been in their families for generations. The next
generation was the generation that stopped gardening and they had no body to
pass their seeds to. 

<p>We were all over the TV and media at that time
Country Calendar etc and they saw us and their seeds began flowing into our
mail box , with their stories and recipes in wobbly hand writing… we felt so
humbled.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/591589/files/20140520044140-kay_and_the_seeds.jpg?1400586100"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>In 1994 the UN estimated that 94 percent of vegetables and 85 percent of
apple varieties have already been lost and a further 3% of the remaining biodiversity
was lost every year after that. <span>Our
ecologists tell us and we can see that life as we know it on earth is dependant
on our biodiveristy and all the connections. With way less than 10% of the food
plants we had 100 years ago we are on a knife edge right now!!</span></p><p><span></span></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F_9jD7ZfWuEA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_9jD7ZfWuEA&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F_9jD7ZfWuEA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>The Koanga
Institute a <b>registered charitable trust in New Zealand</b> has saved 800+
seed lines and 400+ fruit trees and berries varieties. Some of these lines have
international importance, particularly the corn collection, which is one of the
largest collections not affected by genetic engineering, came here with our
ancestors. This collection has many ecological and nutritional characteristics
that will be invaluable for the future of regenerative agriculture and our
health in New Zealand and potentially worldwide.  The home for this
collection is in Wairoa, Northern Hawkes bay on leased land.  3 years ago
Koanga Institute found the right land to literally and figuratively plant our
roots. It took 5 years to find this land. This land has:</p>
<ul>
<li>good soils
     and  water, a great climate for growing seeds</li>
<li>3+
     years of investment in the <span>soil
     minerals and biology for growing nutrient dense seeds</span>
</li>
<li>enough area for our collections, growing
     areas, forest
     gardens, isolation gardens ( super important) and nursery,</li>
<li>isolation from horticulture and GE crops,</li>
<li>a large farmhouse, and several sheds, enough
     area to add several small cabins for interns and staff accommodation in
     the future,</li>
<li>a supportive community around us, the potential to develop a full
     campus to train future seed savers and gardeners to care for the next
     generations of heritage seeds and support regenerative agriculture in
     other communities, using the many models on our demonstration site to do
     that</li>
</ul><p><b>Why are the seeds in danger on the 6<sup>th</sup> of June?</b></p>
<p>Koanga
Institute does not own the land its organic heritage seed and tree collection is
located on, it leases it. The current owners and mortgage holders want to sell
it now. If Koanga Institute wants to buy the land it must come up with the
funds by the 6<sup>th</sup> of June or be evicted with its heritage seed and
tree collection on the 16<sup>th</sup> of July.</p>
<p>Whilst Koanga
Institute can sustain its operational activities through seed sales and
educational offerings, it does not have the capacity for such a large capital
investment. The land asking price is NZD $705,000
(USD 609,000). Initially we were given to the 29<sup>th</sup> of June to raise
the funds. This deadline has now been moved forward to the 6<sup>th</sup> of
June. If we do not pay on the 6<sup>th</sup> of June we will be evicted on the
16<sup>th</sup> of July. <b>This platform takes donations from USD10.00 which converts roughly to NZD12.90 and no extra fees.</b> Please note this website pays out even if the full target is not reached. If the full target is not reached we will continue to search for other means to top up the fund.<br/></p>
<p>We are doing everything in our power to raise funds from national
speaking tours, national workshops, online crowd fundraising, looking for
business sponsorship, offering memberships, but we need your help.So far we have raised USD129,000</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/595237/files/20140521125519-seeds_2.jpg?1400702119"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><b>Why are heritage or heirloom organic seeds
so important?</b>
<p>We know from taste, our feelings and
from science, that our heritage food plants contain the potential for providing
us with far more nutrition than modern industrial food plants could. We can see
the direct link between nutrient dense food and health, and between highly mineralized
soils and health. Seeds before industrialization… were selected for </p>
<p><span>•<span> 
</span></span>Local soils and
environment, they did well in our own garden situations</p>
<p><span>•<span> 
</span></span>Selected to
nourish people</p>
<p><span>•<span> 
</span></span>Selected to
disease resistance and health in local environment</p>
<p><span>•<span> 
</span></span>Taste, and
usefulness in the kitchen</p>
<p><span>•<span> 
</span></span>These seeds
were all an amazing collection of genetic material, that nourished us, grow
well in our soil and climate area, had the genetic blueprint to survive climate
change. </p>
<p><span>•<span> 
</span></span>Industrial system has selected for production, shelf life, toughness,
harvesting all at once, and many other reasons. The responsibility of the
system is to the shareholders, it is all about financial returns, they are not
responsible to you and I and our health.</p>
<p><b>The implications of this are</b></p>
<p><span>•<span> 
</span></span>Most of our seeds produce fruit, vegetables that are flavorless and
uninviting. so they process it and add loads of fillers, homogenizers, colors
and flavors and preservatives to make
it taste better and sell better and make money </p>
<p><span>•<span> 
</span></span>Many of our seeds contain enzyme blockers which mean they cannot pick up
key minerals from the soil anymore, they can never be nutrient dense and we
don’t get key minerals in our bodies i.e. manganese. Most hybrid seeds are like
this. Organic food grown from hybrid seed (not organic or heirloom or heritage
seed) will not contain these minerals any more than non-organic food</p>
<p><span>•<span> 
</span></span>we cannot save our own seeds from these seeds</p>
<p><span>•<span> 
</span></span>seeds bred and selected in the industrial system are bred to need industrial
inputs</p>
<p><span>•<span> 
</span></span>The implications of using seed that has been grown in soils that have
been treated with round up or seeds that are RoundUp Ready GE seeds are
large<span>  and not life affirming. </span>The latest information shows us that seeds grown in
systems where glyphosate has been used carry the glyphosate in the seed, and
the food grown from that seed, a for generation after generation and
(glyohosate is patented as an anti microbial/ anti life<span>  product). The implications for our health are
enormous. </span></p><p><b>About Koanga Institute</b></p>
<p>Kay Baxter realised the trees and seeds hold our stories,
they tell us who we are! She began saving New Zealand heritage seeds after the
nuclear disaster in Russia Chernobyl, when she realised our absolute
vulnerability being almost totally dependant here in this land on seed from
countries in the Northern hemisphere ( at that point under a nuclear cloud).</p>
<p>Kay with partner Bob Corker founded Koanga Institute. ‘We
were simply acting on our gut feelings however after 25 years of living with
these seeds, of growing them in our food gardens, and of them being all our
children and now grandchildren know in their lives we have come to understand
just ho every critical they are for our future’. </p>
<p>The F.A.O told us all 20 years ago that we had 10% of the
vegie varieties left that we’d held in the world 100 years before that. They
are still being lost at a rate of 3% a year, 
that means in our estimation we’re really lucky if we have 3% left. Our
ecologist tell us and it’s easy to see stat life as we know it depends upon
diversity and integration. If we only have 3% or less of our for plants
left  we’re not doing well and the implications are enormous. The knew
science of epigenetics is also now showing us that our own heritage food plants
communicate with our DNA more clearly than somebody else’s food , and that for
our DNA to remain intact and not deteriorate we need certain levels of minerals
and vitamins etc. The only food plants we have that were selected and held and
grown to nourish us are those we co evolved with, our heritage food plants.
They are our ancestors gift to us, they are our most precious Toanga (sacred
treasure).</p>

settled in New Zealand. Some of the seed lines do not exist any longer in their
country of origin.Kay says ‘Old people who sent us in
their sacred seeds 30 years ago understood the sacredness of
their seeds, that had been in their families for generations. The next
generation was the generation that stopped gardening and they had no body to
pass their seeds to. 

We were all over the TV and media at that time
Country Calendar etc and they saw us and their seeds began flowing into our
mail box , with their stories and recipes in wobbly hand writing… we felt so
humbled.
In 1994 the UN estimated that 94 percent of vegetables and 85 percent of
apple varieties have already been lost and a further 3% of the remaining biodiversity
was lost every year after that. Our
ecologists tell us and we can see that life as we know it on earth is dependant
on our biodiveristy and all the connections. With way less than 10% of the food
plants we had 100 years ago we are on a knife edge right now!!
The Koanga
Institute a registered charitable trust in New Zealand has saved 800+
seed lines and 400+ fruit trees and berries varieties. Some of these lines have
international importance, particularly the corn collection, which is one of the
largest collections not affected by genetic engineering, came here with our
ancestors. This collection has many ecological and nutritional characteristics
that will be invaluable for the future of regenerative agriculture and our
health in New Zealand and potentially worldwide.  The home for this
collection is in Wairoa, Northern Hawkes bay on leased land.  3 years ago
Koanga Institute found the right land to literally and figuratively plant our
roots. It took 5 years to find this land. This land has:

good soils
     and  water, a great climate for growing seeds
3+
     years of investment in the soil
     minerals and biology for growing nutrient dense seeds

enough area for our collections, growing
     areas, forest
     gardens, isolation gardens ( super important) and nursery,
isolation from horticulture and GE crops,
a large farmhouse, and several sheds, enough
     area to add several small cabins for interns and staff accommodation in
     the future,
a supportive community around us, the potential to develop a full
     campus to train future seed savers and gardeners to care for the next
     generations of heritage seeds and support regenerative agriculture in
     other communities, using the many models on our demonstration site to do
     that
Why are the seeds in danger on the 6th of June?
Koanga
Institute does not own the land its organic heritage seed and tree collection is
located on, it leases it. The current owners and mortgage holders want to sell
it now. If Koanga Institute wants to buy the land it must come up with the
funds by the 6th of June or be evicted with its heritage seed and
tree collection on the 16th of July.
Whilst Koanga
Institute can sustain its operational activities through seed sales and
educational offerings, it does not have the capacity for such a large capital
investment. The land asking price is NZD $705,000
(USD 609,000). Initially we were given to the 29th of June to raise
the funds. This deadline has now been moved forward to the 6th of
June. If we do not pay on the 6th of June we will be evicted on the
16th of July. This platform takes donations from USD10.00 which converts roughly to NZD12.90 and no extra fees. Please note this website pays out even if the full target is not reached. If the full target is not reached we will continue to search for other means to top up the fund.
We are doing everything in our power to raise funds from national
speaking tours, national workshops, online crowd fundraising, looking for
business sponsorship, offering memberships, but we need your help.So far we have raised USD129,000Why are heritage or heirloom organic seeds
so important?
We know from taste, our feelings and
from science, that our heritage food plants contain the potential for providing
us with far more nutrition than modern industrial food plants could. We can see
the direct link between nutrient dense food and health, and between highly mineralized
soils and health. Seeds before industrialization… were selected for 
• 
Local soils and
environment, they did well in our own garden situations
• 
Selected to
nourish people
• 
Selected to
disease resistance and health in local environment
• 
Taste, and
usefulness in the kitchen
• 
These seeds
were all an amazing collection of genetic material, that nourished us, grow
well in our soil and climate area, had the genetic blueprint to survive climate
change. 
• 
Industrial system has selected for production, shelf life, toughness,
harvesting all at once, and many other reasons. The responsibility of the
system is to the shareholders, it is all about financial returns, they are not
responsible to you and I and our health.
The implications of this are
• 
Most of our seeds produce fruit, vegetables that are flavorless and
uninviting. so they process it and add loads of fillers, homogenizers, colors
and flavors and preservatives to make
it taste better and sell better and make money 
• 
Many of our seeds contain enzyme blockers which mean they cannot pick up
key minerals from the soil anymore, they can never be nutrient dense and we
don’t get key minerals in our bodies i.e. manganese. Most hybrid seeds are like
this. Organic food grown from hybrid seed (not organic or heirloom or heritage
seed) will not contain these minerals any more than non-organic food
• 
we cannot save our own seeds from these seeds
• 
seeds bred and selected in the industrial system are bred to need industrial
inputs
• 
The implications of using seed that has been grown in soils that have
been treated with round up or seeds that are RoundUp Ready GE seeds are
large  and not life affirming. The latest information shows us that seeds grown in
systems where glyphosate has been used carry the glyphosate in the seed, and
the food grown from that seed, a for generation after generation and
(glyohosate is patented as an anti microbial/ anti life  product). The implications for our health are
enormous. About Koanga Institute
Kay Baxter realised the trees and seeds hold our stories,
they tell us who we are! She began saving New Zealand heritage seeds after the
nuclear disaster in Russia Chernobyl, when she realised our absolute
vulnerability being almost totally dependant here in this land on seed from
countries in the Northern hemisphere ( at that point under a nuclear cloud).
Kay with partner Bob Corker founded Koanga Institute. ‘We
were simply acting on our gut feelings however after 25 years of living with
these seeds, of growing them in our food gardens, and of them being all our
children and now grandchildren know in their lives we have come to understand
just ho every critical they are for our future’. 
The F.A.O told us all 20 years ago that we had 10% of the
vegie varieties left that we’d held in the world 100 years before that. They
are still being lost at a rate of 3% a year, 
that means in our estimation we’re really lucky if we have 3% left. Our
ecologist tell us and it’s easy to see stat life as we know it depends upon
diversity and integration. If we only have 3% or less of our for plants
left  we’re not doing well and the implications are enormous. The knew
science of epigenetics is also now showing us that our own heritage food plants
communicate with our DNA more clearly than somebody else’s food , and that for
our DNA to remain intact and not deteriorate we need certain levels of minerals
and vitamins etc. The only food plants we have that were selected and held and
grown to nourish us are those we co evolved with, our heritage food plants.
They are our ancestors gift to us, they are our most precious Toanga (sacred
treasure).

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Poachers are members of organized criminal networks, armed, trained, and ready for rigors of night fighting in the tough terrain of the African Bush. With about 400 rangers to patrol all of Kruger National Park, they need aircrafts that are tough, reliable, easy to repair, and able to perform their mission with relatively little human assistance.  Current military UAVs require more personnel for operation than manned aircraft.

<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The wcUAVc challenges the world to develop an unmanned aircraft able to fly day and night, independent of weather, and with a high degree of autonomy well beyond that of military aircraft - all under $3,000.</span></div>
<b>The 3-Tier Goal:</b><ul>
<li>Create an awareness for endangered species worldwide.</li>
<li>Energize creative, innovative, and inventive people around the world to contribute towards a UAV that provides an immediate counter to ongoing poaching before the rhinos, elephants, and other endangered species become extinct.</li>
<li>Provide sustainable long-term strategic &amp; tactical solutions for anti-poaching and wildlife trafficking through a collaboration of advanced integrated systems.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Counter Poaching Games</b></h2>
<p>In the spring of 2015, teams competing in the wcUAVc around the world will travel to South Africa to demonstrate their aircraft's ability in a day and night simulated poaching scenario to detect and locate poachers through the integration of sensors, embedded systems, and communications able to relay accurate and timely intelligence to park rangers. </p>

</div>","Innovation. Invention. Intervention                                           The international Wildlife Conservation Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Challenge (wcUAVc) fosters innovation and invention in the design, fabrication, and utilization of unmanned aircraft or drones that emphasizes
integration of sensors
embedded systems
communications
open source 
 in a robust and high endurance aircraft, that assists with counter poaching and illicit wildlife trafficking of endangered species. The wcUAVc is the largest and most distributed aircraft research effort in the world with 139 teams in over 29 countries on 6 continents composed of students, hobbyists, academics, and corporations.                                                                                                    Kashmir-Robotics is the technology and wildlife security division of Kashmir World Foundation (KwF) who acquired the Technology Assisted Counter Poaching (TACP) network.  The network includes scientists and engineers with experience in countering poaching and trafficking of wildlife through application of sensors, communications, and computational technologies; and integrated robotics systems including unmanned aircraft and ground systems.                       The Global War Against PoachingThe rhino horn is one of the most valuable materials on Earth, worth more than six times the value of gold on the streets of Vietnam and China, where it is believed to have great medicinal power. Criminal networks linked to human, drug, and arms trafficking profit on this superstition, while environmentalists race to educate potential consumers about the fallacy of rhino horn medicine. The wcUAVc's innovative teams around the world are racing to invent the first counter poaching drones to prevent poachers from killing critically endangered species at risk of extinction.  South Africa's Kruger National Park is home to 73% of the world's rhino population where 3 rhinos are killed everyday.          


 
Poachers are members of organized criminal networks, armed, trained, and ready for rigors of night fighting in the tough terrain of the African Bush. With about 400 rangers to patrol all of Kruger National Park, they need aircrafts that are tough, reliable, easy to repair, and able to perform their mission with relatively little human assistance.  Current military UAVs require more personnel for operation than manned aircraft. Achieving a breakthrough


in level of autonomy while driving costs down
requires leveraging new open source technology base
sensors 
processors
communications 
developed for smart phones and other personal electronic devices; and it requires innovation and invention in design, fabrication, and operation of aircraft.


The Challenge
The wcUAVc challenges the world to develop an unmanned aircraft able to fly day and night, independent of weather, and with a high degree of autonomy well beyond that of military aircraft - all under $3,000.
The 3-Tier Goal:
Create an awareness for endangered species worldwide.
Energize creative, innovative, and inventive people around the world to contribute towards a UAV that provides an immediate counter to ongoing poaching before the rhinos, elephants, and other endangered species become extinct.
Provide sustainable long-term strategic & tactical solutions for anti-poaching and wildlife trafficking through a collaboration of advanced integrated systems.

Counter Poaching Games
In the spring of 2015, teams competing in the wcUAVc around the world will travel to South Africa to demonstrate their aircraft's ability in a day and night simulated poaching scenario to detect and locate poachers through the integration of sensors, embedded systems, and communications able to relay accurate and timely intelligence to park rangers. 






                       




WE NEED YOUR HELP
In transitioning the innovative technology solutions to applications that will help save wildlife from extinction. We need your contributions to help facilitate wildlife conservation research and development efforts.
-Assessing technology requirements 
-Integrating training programs for park rangers
-Deploying technology solutions into the parks 
-Implement educational programs to help local communities sustain technology solutions
This is bigger than we anticipated so this will help us cover the costs for the counter poaching games and help support our competing teams in their travel to South Africa!

The vast majority of our squad have been together 2-3 years and all attend schools in the croydon areas, with Elmhurst School for Boys being the majority. We have coached this squad voluntarily since the very beginning and through our own hard work over these years we have kept the nucleus of the team together. Most of our past and current squad members are all residents in croydon and as some of you may be aware croydon has a lot of social housing and a lot of run down council estates where most of our players come from. Each year through our own fundraising we have managed (only just) to provide the boys with a new kits, although this has been funded by sponsorship through connections from ourselves most of the time we have still had to purchase other essential football equipment. We have always taken the squad away at the end of every season to either Butlins on a UK soccer camp or Flamingo Land for a weekend camping. This provides some of the squad the only chance to leave croydon on what they would consider a holiday. We believe that this trip would help them not only socially but also on the acedemic aspects aswell. We hope this covers all our hopes and aims and gives you an insight into what we hope to achieve and that you can help towards this goal. We are very passionate about this squad as keeping them together playing football and having a bit of structure is keeping them from hanging about on the streets and maybe getting themselves into trouble or worse.</p><div>

Each year through our own fundraising we have managed (only just) to provide the boys with a new kits, although this has been funded by sponsorship through connections from ourselves most of the time we have still had to purchase other essential football equipment. We have always taken the squad away at the end of every season to either Butlins on a UK soccer camp or Flamingo Land for a weekend camping. This provides some of the squad the only chance to leave croydon on what they would consider a holiday. We believe that this trip would help them not only socially but also on the acedemic aspects aswell. We hope this covers all our hopes and aims and gives you an insight into what we hope to achieve and that you can help towards this goal. We are very passionate about this squad as keeping them together playing football and having a bit of structure is keeping them from hanging about on the streets and maybe getting themselves into trouble or worse.
What We Need & What You Get
 

we aim to raise the £990. needed in order to complete the funding for this tour

<p>One councillor, Wayne Helliar, stated that ""we should not be spending taxpayer dollars to run a business that competes with private enterprise.""</p>
<p>We think that this is unsound logic on the part of folks like Mr. Helliar. In the words of the council Mayor, ""it's like cutting off your nose to spite your face."" </p>
<p><strong>ABOUT THE PARK</strong></p>
<p>Sioux Narrows Provincial Park is a beloved camping spot for thousands of individuals and families, including many regulars from Winnipeg. </p>
<p>The park is operated by the municipality, but the land is owned by Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources.</p>
<p>The park is frequented by loyal patrons year after year because it offers: </p>
<ul>
<li>a unique, pristine natural setting teeming with wildlife</li>
<li>excellent management that ensures a quiet, family-friendly atmosphere</li>
<li>several private campsites, hiking trails, a beach, and boat launch</li>
<li>close proximity to the town of Sioux Narrows and its businesses</li>
</ul><p><strong>OTHER PARK CLOSURES</strong></p>
<p>As part of a new trend in Ontario, the provincial government closed Caliper Lake Provincial Park last year -- to the continuing disapproval of businesses in nearby Nestor Falls. Sioux Narrows is the only provincial park left in the region, and it's run by the municipal government. </p>
<p><strong>UNSOUND PLANNING </strong></p>
<p><strong>We think that this is unsound economic planning on the part of the council; that</strong><strong> they're not fully considering the revenue the park tourists contribute to the community when they buy fishing licences, gas, and food at local restaurants.</strong> </p>
<p>Since nearby private campgrounds do not offer the same unique features as SNPP, it's unlikely to think that patrons of the provincial park will flock to these so-called ""competitor"" campgrounds. Instead, the town will likely lose the traffic and business associated with the park’s tourist population.</p>
<p>New ""attractions"" such as the sparsely frequented Sportfishing Centre (at a total cost of $726,000.00 to the community) will likely prove to be a bigger year-over-year drain on tax revenue.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>// WHAT WE WANT TO DO</strong></h2>
<p><strong>First, we want to help pay off the park's modest $50,000.00 debt.</strong> The target amount of $53,500.00 includes fees payable to Indiegogo.</p>
<p>If about <em>500 people donate $100.00 (or 1000 people donate $50.00)</em>, we will have paid off the park's debt, removing this as an excuse to close the park! </p>
<p><strong>Second,</strong> <strong>we want to help the park restructure</strong> and promote so that it can stay open for many years to come.</p>
<p><strong>Third, we will encourage the Province of Ontario to transfer operations of the park to a new non-profit <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_land_trust"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Community Land Trust</a> </strong>(CLT) specifically set up to manage the park.  </p>
<p><strong>If the municipality closes the park anyway</strong>, a new Community Land Trust will invest the money in an ongoing campaign to keep the park open, or re-open the park after its closure. If this campaign fails, we will undertake to create a private park that retains the characteristics of Sioux Narrows Provincial Park.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>// HOW MUCH WE NEED TO DO IT</strong></h2>
<p><strong>If we raise anything up to $53,500, </strong>we will help pay off the park's operating line of credit.</p>
<p><strong>If we raise $60,000-80,000,</strong> we will help the park restructure and promote. We will also ask Ontario's Provincial Government to transfer operations of the park from the municipality to a new non-profit Community Land Trust (CLT) set up to run the park over the long-term. </p>
<p><strong>If we raise $80,000+</strong> we will set up a foundation dedicated to the ongoing management of Sioux Narrows Provincial Park by a new CLT. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>// WHAT YOU GET</strong></h2>
<p>As a Sioux Narrows enthusiast, we will credit you with a stay at the campground with your donation of $50.00 or more. It's like a cash advance to the park. </p>
<p>Remember, if roughly <em>500 people donate $100.00 <em>(or 1000 people donate $50.00)</em></em>, we will have paid off the park's debt! </p>
<p>Your favourite campground has a chance at staying open for many years to come. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>// THE BROADER IMPACT</strong></h2>
<p>Setting up a Community Land Trust (CLT) could set a precedent for how public assets can be maintained in the years to come as governments face cash crunches and make poor investments. </p>
<p>CLTs have been in existence for centuries, and have been experiencing a renaissance over the last fifty years due to the need for new tools to restore, operate, and develop public assets such as parks -- on a financially sustainable basis.</p>
<p>Under a “land first” operation strategy, they have proven successful tools for maintaining and operating public assets that local governments have otherwise had difficulty operating during this period of economic deregulation.</p>

Giant Sequoias can be 'finicky' for the first 3-5yrs of their life. Environmental changes and shock can cause the trees the stop growing, or even die off.  We have been in contact with several individuals and organizations who have successfully raised Giant Sequoias, both here at Lake Bluff Bird Sanctuary, and in the Pacific Northwest.  They have been a tremendous help thus far, and have offered to assist with knowledge and troubleshooting whenever needed.     Other Ways You Can Help Can't make a contribution right now? That doesn't mean you can't help!  Speaking the word about this campaign far and wide is almost as good as cash!  Please, PLEASE take a moment to share this campaign on your social media pages and profiles, and do it often. Get your friends and family to share the campaign as well. Every face that sees it, is a potential contributor.  We thank you for your help. After that, there are other ways to chip in:  We will need volunteers! Help with moving the trees, planting the trees this spring, and maintaining the trees through the summer and fall. And then again next year. And the next year. And the year after that!  Want to help?  It would make for an AWESOME family event. Bring the kids! Let's get them involved, watch them grow up together. Resources! If you have anything that might be of use to a couple people trying to raise giant trees, (landscape supplies, commercial truck, etc), please be sure to drop us a line! It will surely come in handy when it comes to plant.   THANK YOU to everyone who has made this a possibility. And thank you to everyone who has made a contribution in some way. It's humbling to see a community come together and make 'make an idea grow'!",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>My name is Sam Love and if
you hate roadside plastic bags that can get into our food chain as much as I do
this is your chance to fund the centerpiece of a children’s educational
campaign on this critical issue. </p>
<p>Plastic in our oceans and inland
waters is becoming a crisis. You’ve seen the alarming pictures of the massive
floating plastic gyres in the ocean but even worse is that most of the plastic
in the ocean is now broken down into such small pieces we don’t even see them. The
tragedy is that marine animals are devouring the petrochemicals and they are
getting into the food chain. We are only now understanding the environmental
impact of this. I believe education can play an important role in making people
more aware of the problem so I’m launching an Indiegogo campaign to fund a
children’s book, <i>My Little Plastic Bag</i>,
that will be the centerpiece for a campaign that can build awareness about this
critical issue. Supporting this campaign is your chance to do something about
it. </p>
<p><b>Just consider this one fact.</b>
A United Nations study found over 46,000 pieces of plastic per square mile in
many parts of the ocean. </p>
<p>In the
child friendly pictures and story we see a plastic bag tossed out by a careless
child. No one picks it up and it is cut into small slivers by a mower. The
pieces wash into a stream, an estuary and the ocean. As sunlight and the tides break
up the plastic, smaller fish and other sea creatures ingest the tiny bits.
Bigger fish eat the smaller fish and the chemicals concentrate up the food
chain until the plastic comes back to the family as fish on their dinner plate.</p>
<p><b>Where did the book idea come from?</b></p>
<p>I was on the national staff
of the first Earth Day and I have worked over the years with numerous
environmental campaigns. My articles on energy and the environment have been
published in magazines such as Smithsonian and now I write poetry that highlights
the cracks in our culture. </p>
<p>The idea for this children’s
book came from my poem “The Downstream Loop” in my book <i>Converging Waters</i>.  It traces
the flow of a plastic bag through the ecosystem until the chemicals come back
to a family’s dinner plate. Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment featured it in an
issue of their wonderful environmental magazine <i>Eno</i>. Several people suggested it
could make a children’s story so I am now working with Samrae Duke, an
accomplished illustrator, to simplify the poem’s language and create compelling
illustrations. It will be perfect for reading to children 4 to 8. </p><p><b>It will  educate them on two important ecological
concepts: </b></p>
<p><b>1.
There is no away.  </b></p>
<p><b>2.
There are cycles in nature. </b></p>
<p>This will give
teachers and parents a great teaching tool to build awareness of environmental
stewardship. It will be available for sale through book distribution channels
including Amazon. To make sure the message gets out I am partnering with my
local River Keepers group to place copies in the hands of every children’s
librarian and second grade teacher in our North Carolina watershed if enough
funds are raised. With your help we can
make this happen.</p>
<p>By backing this campaign, you'll not only preorder this
beautiful and informative book to share with your family or friends, but you
will help bring to life this educational campaign about the damage we are doing
to the Earth’s waters. <b>Each and every pledge helps make this possible.</b></p>
<p>The goal of this Indiegogo project is to raise money for the
first phase of the project, which is paying for production of the book. Additional funds will be used to provide free copies to the River Keepers for distribution to schools and libraries.</p>

</h3>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Think back to your childhood.  We all chased a butterfly in a field or down the sidewalk at some time or another, right?  Most likely, one of those butterflies was a Monarch butterfly; they used to be one of the most commonly seen and recognized butterflies of all. In fact, some call the Monarch the King of the Butterflies.  All hail the Monarch!</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Here's the catch: In the past two years, according to Monarch Watch, the Monarch butterfly population has declined at a rate of 82%, a figure catching everyone by surprise.  </span></p>

<p><i>You might be asking yourself, “Why?”  Good question!</i></p>
<p>There are a few different factors to consider:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Climate change</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">, which affects everything, is also affecting the butterflies.  Wildfires, droughts, and floods are ruining all of the places Monarchs need to be.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Deforestation</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> in Mexican forests. After the Monarchs have made the 1,500+ mile journey across Canada and the United States, they expect to have a nice, relaxing winter in the picturesque Michoacan mountains in Mexico, the one place every single one of their ancestors has wintered.  But what’s this?  Thousands of acres of these woods are simply no longer there.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Disappearing breeding habitat</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">.  Once the Monarchs start to thaw out (literally!), they begin the trek north to pass along their amazing history to their future generations.  They expect to be able to lay eggs on Milkweed plants all along the journey – in Texas, Iowa, Toronto, and everywhere in between – but lately, have found the plant destroyed.  The main reason for this recent decline is because of the widespread use of <b>glyphosates, like Roundup</b>, which kills everything in its path except <b>genetically modified crops</b> (soybean and corn, mainly) immune to the deadly herbicide.  Without milkweed along the way, adult monarchs have nowhere to lay their eggs.  You might suggest they just lay the eggs elsewhere, but the milkweed plant is the only thing the baby larva eat to survive.  The loss of the milkweed plant is detrimental to the survival of the Monarch species on many levels.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why is This Important?</h3>
<p>The loss of the milkweed and monarch populations is concerning, yet this points to a much bigger and widespread situation.  Monarch butterflies are just one of the many thousands of types of pollinators.  Pollinators play a vital role in spreading the seed of fruits, vegetables, wildflowers, and trees.  To put it simply, pollinators are crucial for production of important agricultural crops, including corn, wheat, rice, apples, oranges, tomatoes, and squash.</p>
<p><i>In nature, everything is related.  In our world, everything is interconnected.</i></p>
<p>Without milkweed and other pollinating plants, butterflies, bees, moths, wasps, flies, and beetles (all pollinators!) will have no place to feed, breed, or survive.  Without these insects, the production of the food we eat will be impacted on an international level.</p>
<p><i>Survival of the Milkweed and Monarch represents survival for the rest of us.</i></p>

<p><i>:Enter 99 Counties:</i></p>

<p>This provides us an opportunity to collaborate with conservation boards, non-profits, schools, or camps in each county.  During the planning and preparation stages of the project, we will reach out to contacts, referrals, and supporters of the project located in each county.  The conservation board in each county will need to be involved, so that they are aware of what we are doing and can ideally provide support.  Most of the counties have some sort of nature preserve area or park, and these will be targeted as planting locales.  <br/></p>
<p>We love this project because it is accessible to everyone. All ages can participate and help plant seeds during one of our events or in their own backyards! In each county, we will do our best to arrange a planting event, inviting certain groups to join us and help plant.  To make these connections, we will ask conservation boards and non-profits for recommendations. </p>

</div></div>","""Happiness is a butterfly, which when pursued, is always just beyond your grasp, but which, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you.""                                                                                          - Nathaniel Hawthorne


Let's Talk.

Think back to your childhood.  We all chased a butterfly in a field or down the sidewalk at some time or another, right?  Most likely, one of those butterflies was a Monarch butterfly; they used to be one of the most commonly seen and recognized butterflies of all. In fact, some call the Monarch the King of the Butterflies.  All hail the Monarch!
Here's the catch: In the past two years, according to Monarch Watch, the Monarch butterfly population has declined at a rate of 82%, a figure catching everyone by surprise.  



You might be asking yourself, “Why?”  Good question!
There are a few different factors to consider:



Climate change, which affects everything, is also affecting the butterflies.  Wildfires, droughts, and floods are ruining all of the places Monarchs need to be.


Deforestation in Mexican forests. After the Monarchs have made the 1,500+ mile journey across Canada and the United States, they expect to have a nice, relaxing winter in the picturesque Michoacan mountains in Mexico, the one place every single one of their ancestors has wintered.  But what’s this?  Thousands of acres of these woods are simply no longer there.


Disappearing breeding habitat.  Once the Monarchs start to thaw out (literally!), they begin the trek north to pass along their amazing history to their future generations.  They expect to be able to lay eggs on Milkweed plants all along the journey – in Texas, Iowa, Toronto, and everywhere in between – but lately, have found the plant destroyed.  The main reason for this recent decline is because of the widespread use of glyphosates, like Roundup, which kills everything in its path except genetically modified crops (soybean and corn, mainly) immune to the deadly herbicide.  Without milkweed along the way, adult monarchs have nowhere to lay their eggs.  You might suggest they just lay the eggs elsewhere, but the milkweed plant is the only thing the baby larva eat to survive.  The loss of the milkweed plant is detrimental to the survival of the Monarch species on many levels.




Why is This Important?
The loss of the milkweed and monarch populations is concerning, yet this points to a much bigger and widespread situation.  Monarch butterflies are just one of the many thousands of types of pollinators.  Pollinators play a vital role in spreading the seed of fruits, vegetables, wildflowers, and trees.  To put it simply, pollinators are crucial for production of important agricultural crops, including corn, wheat, rice, apples, oranges, tomatoes, and squash.
In nature, everything is related.  In our world, everything is interconnected.
Without milkweed and other pollinating plants, butterflies, bees, moths, wasps, flies, and beetles (all pollinators!) will have no place to feed, breed, or survive.  Without these insects, the production of the food we eat will be impacted on an international level.
Survival of the Milkweed and Monarch represents survival for the rest of us.




:Enter 99 Counties:
The 99 Counties Project We hope to plant butterfly milkweed in all 99 counties of Iowa, documenting the journey via our website blog and social media along the way.  


This provides us an opportunity to collaborate with conservation boards, non-profits, schools, or camps in each county.  During the planning and preparation stages of the project, we will reach out to contacts, referrals, and supporters of the project located in each county.  The conservation board in each county will need to be involved, so that they are aware of what we are doing and can ideally provide support.  Most of the counties have some sort of nature preserve area or park, and these will be targeted as planting locales.  
We love this project because it is accessible to everyone. All ages can participate and help plant seeds during one of our events or in their own backyards! In each county, we will do our best to arrange a planting event, inviting certain groups to join us and help plant.  To make these connections, we will ask conservation boards and non-profits for recommendations. 
What We Need & What You Get
 To succeed, we need seeds!  



By funding this project, you will be allowing us to purchase native Butterfly Milkweed seeds, Asclepias.  We have allotted for one ounce per county, although if our funds allow us to purchase more, we would certainly do that!  Current market price for one ounce of seed is $30.


We will also be traveling across the state a handful of times to carry out the planting events.  We will be contacting county conservation boards and other entities to coordinate travel and event dates, but logistically we'd need to make a few different trips.  We'll most likely couch-surf or camp, so our travel costs will only include gas and the occasional meal.


Finally, your funding will go to marketing efforts, including promotional postcards and flyers.  We will be using social media and digital means, but still see a need to reach those populations in Iowa who may not have access to internet or those who don't tweet.  


If we don't reach the entire goal, we'll do as much planting as we can with the funds we get.  Obviously, reaching the entire goal is ideal, as we don't want any counties to feel left out!

  The Impact By planting at least one ounce of Butterfly Milkweed seed in each of the 99 counties in Iowa, we will have made a small, yet powerful step in the right direction. Certainly, 99 ounces is a drop in the bucket compared to the total loss of 82% of milkweed in the state of Iowa.  However, our hope is that the education and advocacy that will happen along the way will make an impact in changing the ideas and misconceptions of Iowans.  By partnering with county conservation boards, schools, camps, or non-profits, we hope to spread a message of urgency about the decline of both the milkweed and monarch populations.

Gaining momentum for this essential need is only possible with your support.

  Risks & Challenges We will most likely face uninformed opinions, or perspectives that may have a different priority than our own. We will face farmers whose livelihood depends on a clean, milkweed-free crop.  We will face county boards ignoring our call.  Still, we will persevere.  Don't worry: we are expecting to get our hands dirty.
The 99 Counties Project will take many weekends to complete.  However, we are avid travelers and are a tad obsessed with exploring this state of Iowa.  Meeting interesting folks from all over the state whilst planting something that contributes to the survival of a species sounds like enough of a motivation to us.
Perhaps the greatest risk of all is that, even when successful with the 99 Counties Project, our efforts may not make enough of a significant difference in the milkweed and Monarch populations.  Glyphosates may still prevail.

We
are Shaheen Niksefat, Michael Ginsburg, Mark Weikel, and Roby Sturgill, four
undergraduate students from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville with a
passion for the outdoors. We are very excited to partner with Ijams Nature
Center in a campaign to raise funds to purchase a floating dock in the widely
revered Mead’s Quarry. Our goal is to raise $2,600 to fund the dock, which will
be an integral part for the summer programs.
Ijams is a
300-acre urban ecosystem that features 10 miles of trails that spans over a
variety of terrain. Founded in 1910 by Harry Ijams, it is one of the oldest
parks in Tennessee. A renowned bird-watching hotspot, Ijams offers plenty of
hiking, biking, and picnic opportunities along with marble quarries to explore,
river boardwalks, and beautiful wildflowers. With your help we can add this
dock to the extensive list of attractions at this park.
What We
Need and What You Get
Ijams
Nature Center needs help purchasing the floating dock, so that Ijams can
continue to provide a natural escape for the Knoxville community.  To reach our goal of helping Ijams purchase a
floating dock for Mead’s Quarry, our goal is to raise a total of $2,600 for
Ijams Nature Center. Your donations will help Ijams provide a safe, exciting, and
well-maintained area for the Knoxville area to enjoy.

<h3>About the Tar Sands</h3>
<p>Canada's Tar sands are believed to be the second largest oil reserve on earth (next to Saudi Arabia) and represent an enormous economic opportunity for Canada and Big Oil. Unfortunately, the economy and the environment do not always share the same priorities, often one flourishes at the other's expense.</p>
<p>The current oil sand mining methodologies are driven by cost and technology limitations, resulting in processes that make this mining operation one of the world's greatest environmental threats. Global demand and capitalism continue to drive priorities, positioning  environmental concerns far behind profits.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is overly idealistic to suggest this oil should not be mined, but it is completely reasonable to suggest there is a more responsible way to do it. Big Oil is realizing record profits at the expense of our environment. This hunger for profit results in catastrophic moral and ethical compromises.</p>
<p>The Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines Proposal is an extreme example of Big Oil's thirst for profit and disregard for the environment. The proposal puts thousands of square miles of wilderness at risk in the name of profit. This is not acceptable, especially considering Big Oil's history of system failures.</p>
