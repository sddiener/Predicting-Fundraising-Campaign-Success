<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We are 2 engineers and 2 cousins and we were tired of spending +30% of our travel budget on Airport transfers. We created Tindrive to solve this issue.</li>
<li>This crowdfunding Campaign will help us launch Tindrive in a first target city where Airport transfers are expensive (Paris for instance)</li>
<li>Contributors will help us achieve a cheap driving experience (€0.8/km) in this target city.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We need €20000 to launch Tindrive with 3 used electric cars and 2 motivated drivers for 6 months to showcase the app (already available on the app store and Google play) in the targeted city (for instance Paris).</li>
<li>These first cars on Tindrive will demonstrate our business model and our competitive price of €0.8/km, making for example a drive to Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport at €19 from Paris Downtown compared to €54 with Uber</li>
<li>If we don't reach your entire goal the funds will go into buying the sensors we need for our different internship proposals (cf. PM2.5 dynamic monitoring, dB level dynamic monitoring, 4G/5G/wifi dynamic monitoring)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>By contributing to this Project you will help end the oligopoly Taxis/Uber have on airport transfers and make the airport transfers as small fraction of the total travel budget as it should always have been. In addition you will help car owners - all car owners, including  2-doors car, older cars, convertibles, etc - who are not accepted on Uber/Taxis to make some extra Money with their cars. Indeed, Tindrive is legal and available for all, since it is a car rental service.</li>
<li>This is not our first app/Project and you can check out our Barterx app if you are curious. Basically we get things done.</li>
<li>The Tindrive app is ready and we want to demonstrate it with first users and vehicles. Do not hesitate to try it yourself.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Tindrive uses a sharing economy business model which utilises already existing assets like cars. Tindrive do not have to purchase these cars. This is a major benefit – at least in terms of the cost structure. It can help to scale up the business extremely fast. But it can also limit this. If potential car owners ar not willing to join Tindrive, it will fail. And this critical mass problem (or chicken and egg problem)  is why we want to start with our own cars for a few months.</li>
<li>By demonstrating the financial benefits of renting the Wheel of the 3 cars we will operate thanks to this Campaign Tindrive intends to attract some car owners who cannot presently work for Uber/Taxis, because their cars are not accepted (ex:2-doors or leisure activity vehicles or light commercial vehicles) and solve this chicken and egg issues typical of sharing economy platforms.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>If you cannot contribute financially to this Campaign but you are tired of expensive airport transfers fares or if your car does not qualify on Uber/Taxi you can support us by downloading our app and register as a user or as a car owner.</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share Tools to spread the Word: there is an alternative to Uber/Taxi and it is cheaper because you drive. It is called Tindrive.</li>
</ul>

<p>My name is Roger Artola and I am a film maker and car enthusiast. I have been working in the film industry for the past eight years. Something I would always notice on my way to different productions were people pulled over on the side of the road. I would stop to help when I could, but what I found was most people didn’t have road side assistance. They would call a friend and hope they weren’t busy or ask a stranger to help. Most of the time it would be something simple like running out of gas or needing a jump. These days most people don't have the time to wait hours on end for a tow truck and even if they did have AAA, they had to make sure they weren’t maxed out on their service for the year. These situations are where the Rode Syde app could have really come in handy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The key to a successful app is function and reliability. With your contributions we can maximize the apps potential and insure a strong launch for this app. I believe this app has the potential to be very successful.</p>
<p>Every cent that is raised for this campaign will go towards developing this app properly. I want this to be an app for the people. The idea behind Rode Syde is to give something back to the community, offering both financial freedom and quick access to top notch road side assistance. My goal for this app is to always put the people first. We are excited for the fun perks we are providing. We will be rewarding those who back us with Jumps, gas refills, car washes,  and so much more. If for some reason we do not make our goal, we will still be pressing forward with this project doing everything we can with what we’ve received.</p>
<p>Rode Syde is my way of giving back to society and giving the power back to the people. As a successful business owner of a production company, I am confident that my passion for technology and helping others can be merged into this one app where everyone benefits. I have big plans for reward systems for both the Rode Syde providers and the service requesters.</p>
<p>With any business there will always be challenges. The biggest challenge will be making something that is user friendly and fun to use. With your help we can insure that we have the team capable of molding that reality. Even if you are unable to contribute to this project, a simple repost or share can do wonders for us. We thank you for being a part of Rode Syde in any capacity.    </p>

</div></div>","Did you generally get into this trouble?
You want to drive a car happily but your seat is not your favorite position. And you don't know where it is.
  

Seatmemo is the answer.
No more frustration of driving position!
Seatmemo is a pair of small devices attached to the front seat of your car.

*The size is the approximate size of the prototype version. A little change in size may occur in the final version.

 

How do they work?
There are 2 parts of Seatmemo that assist you by indicating the exact seat position.
The backrest part is attached at the side of the backrest area.
LED light will show up when your backrest angle is exactly at your incline angle.

The bottom part is attached at the side of of the seat.
LED light will show up when your seat is exactly at your position.

 
And after your position is set.

You can switch off the LED light.

 
Solved!!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Gavin Wilding and I am the inventor and CEO of Griffen Securities which has invented the Griff-Lock Car Immobilizer System - a unique protection for your car from the sophisticated car thieves of today.</p>
<p>We have at last come up with a 4-point system that cannot be circumvented unlike others on the market place. As soon as you switch off the vehicle ignition, the Griff-Lock locks down your car and can only be started by you once you activate our unique rolling code with your FOB.</p>
<p>We have done all the testing necessary to bring this to the market and are now ready to go into production.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have already spent a considerable amount of money to get to this point and now are looking to raise 495,000 USD for our Campaign to invest in production and our marketing plan.</p>
<p>Come join us on this journey and with a donation of just $345 you will receive a full Griff Lock system - a saving of over 30% of the retail price!</p>
<p>This is a onetime special offer to Indiegogo customers during this launch period.</p>
<p>Donate just $100 and you will receive a Griff Lock Hat and T-Shirt.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Why are so many cars still being stolen today?</p>
<p>Over 750,000 cars were stolen last year in the US alone. One of the main reasons for this is down to the car manufacturers who have simply not invested in a fool proof system. If a car is stolen then they can sell another one!! It's pure economics..</p>
<p>The problem with this is that our insurance premiums are now at an all-time high as we the public pay for this, now is our chance to protect our property and hopefully reduce our costs of motoring.</p>
<p>We are excited at the prospect of lower premiums and stopping the car thieves earning from this.</p>
<p>We will make every effort to contact the insurance companies to ensure that all cars fitted with the Griff-Lock receive a discount in premiums and we have already had a lot of interest from them re our product. </p>
</div><div>
<p>Now is the time to protect your Car.</p>
<p>We have a saying at Griff-Lock ''If you can't start it, you can't steal it''</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">VIP-Riders may choose their three favorite drivers and lock them into their VIPR Rider's Account so whenever they need a ride, and if any of their favorite drivers are driving, they may select the one they want.

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">My First Promise is to our Designated Drivers, VIPR will not be offering shared rides!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Being a driver myself, I find that I'm like most drivers, I've grown to dislike ""pool"" or ""shared"" rides. I personally find them frustrating and there seems to be too many personalities and miles to drive for very little money, plus some riders are not considerate of the other passengers or the driver.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>I truly believe that with the multiple income streams generated through the niche market that we're creating our VIPR Designated Drivers, Party Concierges, the iSexy Party Network® and VIPR as a whole will be financially just fine without offering shared rides!</span></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535167529/b6cw6x0zlxoahaiaqqkp.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">My Second Promise is that VIPR Designated Drivers will never lose the opportunity of driving with us as long as manually driven vehicles exist and continue to be manufactured because VIPR and the iSexy Party Network® will always be dedicated to and thankful for our Designated Drivers!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">As far as the future of Self-Driving Cars with VIPR, I'm not sure if we'll ever use them because the safety of our riders, dedicated drivers &amp; pedestrians is paramount to me!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">But if I do decide to add Self-Driving Cars, I already know that each car will be occupied by an iSexy Party Network Party Concierge, seated in the driver's seat, riding along for added security, to answer any questions about VIPR, the iSexy Party Network® and what exciting iSexy things the VIP-Riders can do around town!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533588506/lzmpz5hclsywq7afmmcu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">To make VIPR stand out from all the other services, all Authorized VIPR Designated Drivers will have the option of installing and using our <a href=""http://isexypartynetwork.net/affiliates/reps/blainevk/drivers.php#redbeats"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RedBeats.net - DJ Mixing Board &amp; Music Pool</a> in their vehicle, FREE-OF-CHARGE!</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I wanted the public to get involved with the early development of VIPR, so I set-up this crowd-funding campaign which will not only help raise the money needed to purchase the rideshare app, but through the <i>""VIPR Party Town Contest &amp; Raffle!""</i>, contributors will help decide the next Official VIPR Party Town by nominating their hometown* and if it wins by popular vote, all their entries will be placed in the raffle for a chance to Win a Free Maiden Voyage VIPR Hometown Ride! *Each hometown must have at least 25 nominations to be eligible to win!</p>

<p>Back in 1992, I purchased an antique Military Dog Tag Machine to help bring attention to the ""Gays in the Military"" issue and in July on Gay Pride Weekend in Atlanta, GA. I made and sold over $700.00 in Military Dog Tags! <br/><br/>I'm not implying that me selling Dog Tags made a difference, but ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" was passed on July 19, 1993, allowing closeted members of the military to serve without question while prohibiting those in the military who was openly gay to serve. It wasn't perfect, but it was a start. With the current administration, we have to continue fighting to gain/keep our equal rights.</p>

Click the Contact Us! button below and enter your information. Thanks!</p>

</div></div>","Atlanta, Georgia, USA -- At the iSexy Party Network® LLC, I not only want to help our Very Intelligent Partiers find Amazing Shopping Experiences, Discounts, Free Stuff and Outrageous Party Atmospheres with unique iSexy Games & Entertainment, but I'm truly concerned for their safety and well-being while doing so.
To accomplish this, I decided to develop my own Rideshare Service for the iSexy Party Network, originating first from my hometown of Atlanta, Georgia!
 

VIPR is not a stand-alone rideshare company, it's a service of the iSexy Party Network® adding value to our brand by transporting our VIPs to and from our Official iSexy Party Network Hot Spots.
Our VIPR Designated Drivers are also Party Concierges who are helpful and knowledgeable of what's happening within the iSexy Party Network®.

I not only want to offer affordable, safe & reliable rides but want to reward our riders for using my service. So, I'm giving VIP-Riders 50 Party Points for every $1 Spent on Every Ride, redeemable for any of the thousands of quality products found in our Party Points Gift Mall.

VIP-Riders may choose their three favorite drivers and lock them into their VIPR Rider's Account so whenever they need a ride, and if any of their favorite drivers are driving, they may select the one they want. This will help build strong Rider-Driver Relationships and a strong feeling of familiarity, comfort, and safety!

Every Year, one week before a VIP-Rider's birthday, I will add a Birthday Ride Credit to their VIPR Rider Account, good for up to 25 Miles, that they may use From or To their Birthday Celebration or wherever they wish to go and they may invite as many friends as there are available seats in the Snake!

VIPR will be marketed directly to our Official iSexy Party Network Hot Spots, by our VIPR Designated Drivers/Party Concierges, and when they agree to become an Official VIPR Pick-Up Spot I'll share a 5% commission with them on every ride originating from their business address!

The Official VIPR Pick-Up Spot may keep the 5% Commission.
I can add it back into their VIPR Business Account as a VIPR Ride Credit.
I can donate their Commissions directly to the Charity of their choice!


Authorized VIPR Designated Drivers may also become an Official iSexy Party Network Party Concierge, and vice versa, generating two streams of income simultaneously!

My First Promise is to our Designated Drivers, VIPR will not be offering shared rides!
Being a driver myself, I find that I'm like most drivers, I've grown to dislike ""pool"" or ""shared"" rides. I personally find them frustrating and there seems to be too many personalities and miles to drive for very little money, plus some riders are not considerate of the other passengers or the driver.
I truly believe that with the multiple income streams generated through the niche market that we're creating our VIPR Designated Drivers, Party Concierges, the iSexy Party Network® and VIPR as a whole will be financially just fine without offering shared rides!

My Second Promise is that VIPR Designated Drivers will never lose the opportunity of driving with us as long as manually driven vehicles exist and continue to be manufactured because VIPR and the iSexy Party Network® will always be dedicated to and thankful for our Designated Drivers!
As far as the future of Self-Driving Cars with VIPR, I'm not sure if we'll ever use them because the safety of our riders, dedicated drivers & pedestrians is paramount to me!
But if I do decide to add Self-Driving Cars, I already know that each car will be occupied by an iSexy Party Network Party Concierge, seated in the driver's seat, riding along for added security, to answer any questions about VIPR, the iSexy Party Network® and what exciting iSexy things the VIP-Riders can do around town!

To make VIPR stand out from all the other services, all Authorized VIPR Designated Drivers will have the option of installing and using our RedBeats.net - DJ Mixing Board & Music Pool in their vehicle, FREE-OF-CHARGE!
This will give their VIP-Riders complete control over selecting and playing their favorite music genres and they may even mix it themselves from the comfort of the back seat, if they wish, making the ride not only enjoyable but interactive, crazy fun and groovy!

I wanted the public to get involved with the early development of VIPR, so I set-up this crowd-funding campaign which will not only help raise the money needed to purchase the rideshare app, but through the ""VIPR Party Town Contest & Raffle!"", contributors will help decide the next Official VIPR Party Town by nominating their hometown* and if it wins by popular vote, all their entries will be placed in the raffle for a chance to Win a Free Maiden Voyage VIPR Hometown Ride! *Each hometown must have at least 25 nominations to be eligible to win!
VIPR will become the flagship of the iSexy Party Network! It will be...

Your designated driver in minutes, getting you there safely, even to the grocery!
Transportation to and from our Official iSexy Party Network HotSpots.
A knowledge bank of where to shop and party, ask your Party Concierge!
A Redbeats.net Disco on wheels! Let's Groove Tonight!
An easy way to collect Party Points, don't burn any brain cells over this one!
A rolling recruiting station, as a VIPR Designated Driver/Party Concierge, you may sign new VIPs, Party Concierges, Official iSexy Party Network HotSpots, VIPR Pick-Up Spots, and VIPR Designated Drivers into your network.
Income for VIPR Designated Drivers & Party Concierges.
Income for our VIPR Pick-up Spots.
Income for Charitable Organizations.

Military Dog Tags



 
Back in 1992, I purchased an antique Military Dog Tag Machine to help bring attention to the ""Gays in the Military"" issue and in July on Gay Pride Weekend in Atlanta, GA. I made and sold over $700.00 in Military Dog Tags! I'm not implying that me selling Dog Tags made a difference, but ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" was passed on July 19, 1993, allowing closeted members of the military to serve without question while prohibiting those in the military who was openly gay to serve. It wasn't perfect, but it was a start. With the current administration, we have to continue fighting to gain/keep our equal rights.

Monster Ballchain Necklace


 
Back in ©1992, with the Military Theme still on my mind, I also created the Monster Ballchain Necklace offering a more modern, fashionable, masculine, subtle hint-of-the-military necklace that literally looks amazing with anything a guy could wear; Shirtless, Semi-casual, even draped over a tie while wearing a Dress Suit!

<p>I am the administrator of a Facebook group ( <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/groups/218158413247618/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/groups/218158413247618/</a>) created in February of this year to collect all the owners of the Yamaha 600 TTR in the world who have encountered the same problem, rather handicapping, relating to the lack of availability of the rear fender on the market in relation to the exit of production, years ago and the lack of interest of the manufacturer (ed Yamaha) to proceed with a further limited production to meet this need.</p>
<p>I personally find it important to fix this problem definitively, as the lack of availability of a rear mudguard, a component that often breaks or deteriorates in relation to use, not only constitutes for any rallie or enduro motorcyclist a strong limitation to the use of the bike, but, especially for a vintage motorbike which in order to be registered in the register of vintage motorcycles must only mount original parts, becomes a very evident problem.</p>
<p>All of you, owners of a Yamaha 600TTR, now finally have the opportunity to get this much coveted component and to be able to put even some more in addition, as a spare for the future.</p>
<p>As all of you already had information weeks ago through the Facebook group ""TTR600 - Acerbis / YAMAHA Belgarda"", we have already selected the Italian manufacturer <a href=""https://www.cemoto.it/index.php/company/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cemoto.it/index.php/company/</a> and we are ready to go.</p>
<p>It will take approximately 60 working days, after this fundraising campaign is completed to get the finished product ready for shipment.</p>
<p>In order to be able to start production we have identified the minimum amount to reach equal to Euro 45,000 which corresponds to approximately 530 mudguards for a cost of approximately Euro 85 each.</p>
<p>In short, the 45,000 euros will be allocated for around 25,000 euros to mold production, around 15,000 euros to production, packaging and logistics and around 5,000 euros to fundraising costs.</p>
<p>If we do not reach the target amount, we will have two choices, either, or all the payments will be returned, or, against adhesion of the subscribers who will have already formalized their payments, the residual amount to reach the target amount it will be shared on the quantity of rear fenders already subscribed, to allow the start of production.</p>
<p>I come personally from the management of groups of companies also operating in the sector of plastic and similar components for the first installation of the car sector, consequently I am ready to face any problems of the path, but, I need all of you to let me help all of you in this, now multi-year problem, of lack of this component.</p>
<p>As already anticipated in recent months in the FB group the production of the mudguard will take place in POLYPROPYLENE COPOLYMER resistant to frost and UV with the affixing of a fabric with glass fiber of the size of 200x150mm under the right side in order to avoid burns of the plastic through the muffler.</p>

Yamaha), weitere, wenn auch begrenzte, Produktionen durchzuführen, um diesen Bedarf zu decken.</p>
<p>Ich persönlich halte es für wichtig, dieses Problem endgültig zu lösen, da die fehlende Verfügbarkeit eines hinteren Kotflügels, einer Komponente, die im Rahmen der Nutzung oft bricht oder sich verschlechtert, nicht nur für jeden Rallye- oder Enduro-Motorradfahrer eine ernsthafte Einschränkung darstellt, sondern vor allem , bei einem Oldtimer-Motorrad, das zur Eintragung in das Oldtimer-Motorradregister nur Originalteile montieren darf, wird zu einem ganz offensichtlichen Problem.</p>
<p>Sie alle, Besitzer einer Yamaha 600TTR, haben endlich die Möglichkeit, sich dieses begehrte Bauteil zu besorgen und noch ein paar weitere als Reserve für die Zukunft bauen zu können.</p>
<p>Wie Sie alle vor Wochen in der Facebook-Gruppe ""TTR600 - Acerbis / YAMAHA Belgarda"" informiert wurden, haben wir den italienischen Hersteller <a href=""https://www.cemoto.it/index.php/company/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cemoto.it/index.php/company/</a> bereits ausgewählt und können loslegen.</p>
<p>Am Ende dieser Spendenaktion dauert es ungefähr 60 Werktage, bis das fertige Produkt versandfertig ist.</p>
<p>Für den Serienstart haben wir einen Mindestbetrag von 45.000 Euro ermittelt, was rund 530 Kotflügeln bei einem Preis von jeweils rund 85 Euro entspricht.</p>
<p>Zusammengefasst werden von den ca. 45.000 Euro ca. 25.000 Euro für den Bau des Werkzeugs, ca. 15.000 Euro für Produktion, Verpackung und Logistik sowie ca. 5.000 Euro für Spendenaufwendungen bereitgestellt.</p>
<p>Sollten wir den Zielbetrag nicht erreichen, haben wir zwei Möglichkeiten: Entweder erstatten wir alle Zahlungen zurück oder, mit Zustimmung von Abonnenten, die ihre Zahlungen bereits formalisiert haben, wird der Restbetrag bis zum Erreichen des Zielbetrags durch die Anzahl der Schutzbleche geteilt bereits bestätigt, so dass der Produktionsstart möglich ist.</p>
<p>Ich persönlich komme aus der Geschäftsführung von Konzernen, die auch im Bereich Kunststoffe und ähnliche Komponenten für die Erstmontage des Automobilbereichs tätig sind, also bin ich bereit, mich auf dem Weg zu allen Problemen zu stellen, aber ich brauche Sie alle, um in der Lage zu sein , wiederum, um Ihnen bei diesem dauerhaften Problem des Fehlens dieser Komponente zu helfen.</p>
<p>Wie bereits in den letzten Monaten in der FB-Gruppe geplant, erfolgt die Fertigung des Kotflügels aus frost- und UV-beständigem POLYPROPYLEN-COPOLYMER mit einem Glasfasergewebe der Dimension 200x150mm unter der rechten Seite, um ein Durchbrennen des Kunststoffs durch den Schalldämpfer zu vermeiden. </p>

Yamaha) к дальнейшему ограниченному производству для удовлетворения этой потребности.</p>
<p>Я лично считаю важным решить эту проблему окончательно, так как отсутствие заднего брызговика, компонента, который часто ломается или портится в связи с использованием, не только составляет для любого мотоциклиста ралли или эндуро сильное ограничение на использование крыла. велосипед, но, особенно для старинного мотоцикла, который для того, чтобы быть зарегистрированным в реестре старинных мотоциклов, должен иметь только оригинальные детали, становится очень очевидной проблемой.</p>

<p>Короче говоря, 45 000 евро будут выделены примерно на 25 000 евро на производство пресс-форм, около 15 000 евро на производство, упаковку и логистику и около 5 000 евро на сбор средств.</p>
<p>Если мы не достигнем целевой суммы, у нас будет два варианта: либо все платежи будут возвращены, либо, против согласия подписчиков, которые уже формализовали свои платежи, остаточная сумма для достижения целевой суммы будет можно разделить на количество уже подписанных задних крыльев, чтобы можно было начать производство.</p>

<p>Как уже предполагалось в последние месяцы в группе FB, производство брызговиков будет происходить из ПОЛИПРОПИЛЕНОВОГО СОПОЛИМЕРА, устойчивого к морозу и ультрафиолетовому излучению, с прикреплением ткани со стекловолокном размером 200x150 мм под правой стороной во избежание ожогов. пластик через глушитель.</p>

Si nous n'atteignons pas le montant cible, nous aurons deux choix, soit, soit tous les versements seront restitués, soit, contre adhésion des souscripteurs qui auront déjà formalisé leurs versements, le montant résiduel pour atteindre le montant, il faudra se partager sur la quantité d'ailes arrière déjà souscrites, pour permettre le démarrage de la production.
Je viens personnellement de la direction de groupes d'entreprises opérant également dans le secteur des composants plastiques et similaires pour la première installation du secteur automobile, par conséquent je suis prêt à faire face à tous les problèmes du chemin, mais, j'ai besoin de vous tous pour laisser Je vous aide tous dans ce problème, maintenant pluriannuel, de manque de ce composant.
Comme déjà anticipé ces derniers mois dans le groupe FB la production du garde-boue se déroulera en POLYPROPYLENE COPOLYMERE résistant au gel et aux UV avec l'apposition d'un tissu en fibre de verre de la taille de 200x150mm sous le côté droit afin d'éviter les brûlures de le plastique à travers le silencieux.

Soy el administrador de un grupo de Facebook (www.facebook.com/groups/218158413247618/) creado en febrero de este año para recopilar a todos los propietarios de Yamaha 600 TTR en el mundo que se han encontrado con el mismo problema, bastante perjudicial, de relación a la falta de disponibilidad del guardabarros trasero en el mercado en relación a la salida de producción, hace años ya la falta de interés del fabricante (ed Yamaha) por proceder con una producción más limitada para cubrir esta necesidad.
Personalmente me parece importante solucionar definitivamente este problema, ya que la falta de disponibilidad de un guardabarros trasero, un componente que a menudo se rompe o se deteriora con el uso, no solo constituye para cualquier motociclista de rallies o enduro una fuerte limitación al uso del bicicleta, pero, sobre todo para una moto de época que para ser inscrita en el registro de motos de época sólo deben montar piezas originales, se convierte en un problema muy evidente.
Todos ustedes, propietarios de una Yamaha 600TTR, ahora finalmente tienen la oportunidad de hacerse con este codiciado componente y de poder poner aún más, como repuesto para el futuro.
Como todos ustedes ya tenían información hace semanas a través del grupo de Facebook ""TTR600 - Acerbis / YAMAHA Belgarda"", ya hemos seleccionado al fabricante italiano https://www.cemoto.it/index.php/company/ y estamos listos para ir.
Tomará aproximadamente 60 días hábiles, después de que se complete esta campaña de recaudación de fondos, para que el producto terminado esté listo para su envío.
Para poder iniciar la producción hemos identificado la cantidad mínima a alcanzar igual a 45.000 euros que corresponde aproximadamente a 530 guardabarros por un coste aproximado de 85 euros cada uno.
En definitiva, los 45.000 euros se destinarán por unos 25.000 euros a la producción de moldes, unos 15.000 euros a la producción, envasado y logística y unos 5.000 euros a los costes de captación de fondos.
Si no alcanzamos el monto objetivo, tendremos dos opciones, o bien, o se devolverán todos los pagos, o, en contra de la adhesión de los suscriptores que ya habrán formalizado sus pagos, el monto residual para alcanzar el monto objetivo se compartirá sobre la cantidad de guardabarros traseros ya suscritos, para permitir el inicio de la producción.
Vengo personalmente de la gestión de grupos de empresas que también operan en el sector del plástico y componentes similares para la primera instalación del sector del automóvil, en consecuencia estoy listo para enfrentar cualquier problema del camino, pero, necesito que todos ustedes se dejen Los ayudo a todos en este problema, ahora de varios años, de falta de este componente.
Como ya se anticipó en los últimos meses en el grupo FB la producción del guardabarros se realizará en POLIPROPILENO COPOLÍMERO resistente a las heladas y a los rayos UV con la fijación de un tejido con fibra de vidrio del tamaño de 200x150mm debajo del lado derecho para evitar quemaduras de el plástico a través del silenciador.

Ich bin der Administrator einer Facebook-Gruppe (www.facebook.com/groups/218158413247618/), die diesen Februar gegründet wurde, um alle Yamaha 600 TTR-Besitzer weltweit zu versammeln, die auf das gleiche ziemlich wichtige Problem in Bezug auf die mangelnde Verfügbarkeit auf dem Markt gestoßen sind des hinteren Kotflügels aufgrund der vor Jahren erfolgten Produktionseinstellung und aufgrund des mangelnden Interesses des Herstellers (Hrsg. Yamaha), weitere, wenn auch begrenzte, Produktionen durchzuführen, um diesen Bedarf zu decken.
Ich persönlich halte es für wichtig, dieses Problem endgültig zu lösen, da die fehlende Verfügbarkeit eines hinteren Kotflügels, einer Komponente, die im Rahmen der Nutzung oft bricht oder sich verschlechtert, nicht nur für jeden Rallye- oder Enduro-Motorradfahrer eine ernsthafte Einschränkung darstellt, sondern vor allem , bei einem Oldtimer-Motorrad, das zur Eintragung in das Oldtimer-Motorradregister nur Originalteile montieren darf, wird zu einem ganz offensichtlichen Problem.
Sie alle, Besitzer einer Yamaha 600TTR, haben endlich die Möglichkeit, sich dieses begehrte Bauteil zu besorgen und noch ein paar weitere als Reserve für die Zukunft bauen zu können.
Wie Sie alle vor Wochen in der Facebook-Gruppe ""TTR600 - Acerbis / YAMAHA Belgarda"" informiert wurden, haben wir den italienischen Hersteller https://www.cemoto.it/index.php/company/ bereits ausgewählt und können loslegen.
Am Ende dieser Spendenaktion dauert es ungefähr 60 Werktage, bis das fertige Produkt versandfertig ist.
Für den Serienstart haben wir einen Mindestbetrag von 45.000 Euro ermittelt, was rund 530 Kotflügeln bei einem Preis von jeweils rund 85 Euro entspricht.
Zusammengefasst werden von den ca. 45.000 Euro ca. 25.000 Euro für den Bau des Werkzeugs, ca. 15.000 Euro für Produktion, Verpackung und Logistik sowie ca. 5.000 Euro für Spendenaufwendungen bereitgestellt.
Sollten wir den Zielbetrag nicht erreichen, haben wir zwei Möglichkeiten: Entweder erstatten wir alle Zahlungen zurück oder, mit Zustimmung von Abonnenten, die ihre Zahlungen bereits formalisiert haben, wird der Restbetrag bis zum Erreichen des Zielbetrags durch die Anzahl der Schutzbleche geteilt bereits bestätigt, so dass der Produktionsstart möglich ist.
Ich persönlich komme aus der Geschäftsführung von Konzernen, die auch im Bereich Kunststoffe und ähnliche Komponenten für die Erstmontage des Automobilbereichs tätig sind, also bin ich bereit, mich auf dem Weg zu allen Problemen zu stellen, aber ich brauche Sie alle, um in der Lage zu sein , wiederum, um Ihnen bei diesem dauerhaften Problem des Fehlens dieser Komponente zu helfen.
Wie bereits in den letzten Monaten in der FB-Gruppe geplant, erfolgt die Fertigung des Kotflügels aus frost- und UV-beständigem POLYPROPYLEN-COPOLYMER mit einem Glasfasergewebe der Dimension 200x150mm unter der rechten Seite, um ein Durchbrennen des Kunststoffs durch den Schalldämpfer zu vermeiden.

Я являюсь администратором группы в Facebook (www.facebook.com/groups/218158413247618/), созданной в феврале этого года, чтобы собрать всех владельцев Yamaha 600 TTR в мире, которые столкнулись с той же проблемой, скорее затруднительной, касающейся из-за отсутствия на рынке задних крыльев в связи с прекращением производства несколько лет назад и отсутствием интереса производителя (ред. Yamaha) к дальнейшему ограниченному производству для удовлетворения этой потребности.
Я лично считаю важным решить эту проблему окончательно, так как отсутствие заднего брызговика, компонента, который часто ломается или портится в связи с использованием, не только составляет для любого мотоциклиста ралли или эндуро сильное ограничение на использование крыла. велосипед, но, особенно для старинного мотоцикла, который для того, чтобы быть зарегистрированным в реестре старинных мотоциклов, должен иметь только оригинальные детали, становится очень очевидной проблемой.
Все вы, владельцы Yamaha 600TTR, теперь, наконец, имеете возможность получить этот столь желанный компонент и иметь возможность добавить еще несколько в качестве запасного на будущее.
Поскольку все вы уже получили информацию несколько недель назад через группу Facebook «TTR600 - Acerbis / YAMAHA Belgarda», мы уже выбрали итальянского производителя https://www.cemoto.it/index.php/company/ и готовы к идти.
После завершения кампании по сбору средств подготовка готового продукта к отправке займет около 60 рабочих дней.
Чтобы начать производство, мы определили минимальную сумму, которую необходимо достичь, равную 45 000 евро, что соответствует примерно 530 брызговикам по цене примерно 85 евро каждый.
Короче говоря, 45 000 евро будут выделены примерно на 25 000 евро на производство пресс-форм, около 15 000 евро на производство, упаковку и логистику и около 5 000 евро на сбор средств.
Если мы не достигнем целевой суммы, у нас будет два варианта: либо все платежи будут возвращены, либо, против согласия подписчиков, которые уже формализовали свои платежи, остаточная сумма для достижения целевой суммы будет можно разделить на количество уже подписанных задних крыльев, чтобы можно было начать производство.
Я пришел лично из руководства групп компаний, также работающих в секторе пластмасс и аналогичных компонентов для первой установки автомобильного сектора, поэтому я готов столкнуться с любыми проблемами пути, но мне нужно, чтобы все вы позволили Я помогу всем вам в решении этой многолетней проблемы отсутствия этого компонента.
Как уже предполагалось в последние месяцы в группе FB, производство брызговиков будет происходить из ПОЛИПРОПИЛЕНОВОГО СОПОЛИМЕРА, устойчивого к морозу и ультрафиолетовому излучению, с прикреплением ткани со стекловолокном размером 200x150 мм под правой стороной во избежание ожогов. пластик через глушитель.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Oasis travel systems   </h3>
<p>Hello everyone, my name is Joseph White and I am very excited to bring my idea to life and change transportation for our youth. While we enjoy the heated and cooled seats of our vehicles, our little ones are still in the stone age surrounded by plastics that offer no extended comfort. While my only background in this is being a father myself, I am here to take action and change this issue to better our children.  In the early days of parenthood, I noticed my child was never truly comfortable in her car seat or stroller. No matter what I set the Air condition to she seemed to always have a sweaty back. While also seeing that in cold weather the only answer was to bundle her up so much that she looked like a pink marshmallow with an adorable smile. So I began to think of ways to change this and help her and all other children to be as comfortable as they would want to be, thus Oasis Travel System began. I believe the impact this will have goes far beyond mere additional comfort but increased safety while traveling and more pleasurable outings. Cooling during hot weather will reduce the risk of heat ailments and heating during cold weather will reduce the risk of colds from cold weather. Without the addition of extra layers while traveling in cold weather children will be fastened into their seats properly without the possibility of slipping out in the event of a collision. Furthermore an uncomfortable child is a cranky child and a cranky child is a stressed parent... With your help I know we can change the world of transportation for our little ones, making them and us a lot happier and able to enjoy our moments together more.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Funding and Perks</h3>
<p>Currently we are Patent pending and moving forward toward a prototype.  I have funded this solely myself up to this point and need your help to reach the finish line.  All funds will go toward product research, development, prototype development, patent fees, attorney fees, advertisement, and production. While perks are still being thought up, I feel  custom patterns and personalized covers will be exactly the sort of perk offered. I would really like feed back on what type of perks really interest the group so as to make everyone happy.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Global Impact</h3>
<p>While I know there are contributors in the group that aren't parents, I know this is an area everyone can rally around. The impact this will have for children goes beyond words. The addition of safety and comfort this will give children will change this sector forever. Children are more susceptible to heat and cold extremes, affecting their health and wellbeing. Without the ability to properly regulate their own body temperatures they can fall prey to heat sickness and hypothermia. By offering a heating and cooled seat and stroller, the risks are cut down and their comfort increased. </p>
</div><div>

<h3>Other Ways to Help</h3>
<p>While funding is much appreciate to reach this goal, it isnt the only way people can help. Merely getting the word out to peers and contacts will increase the product visibility and aid in possible larger company assistance with production.</p>

The result is a patented Aerospace design that is completely unique and enables our bike to be manufactured in our hometown. The Celaris adds a new chapter to Windsor’s long history as a hotbed of Canadian manufacturing.Striking good looks and a smooth, quiet ride.Our choice of primary drive ratio, patented rider seating position, and the bike’s light weight, give the rider a very low and stable centre of gravity. This makes the bike all but disappear and you will glide along like never before. Riding is believing.The Celaris puts the rider in a safe riding position. Riding upright helps you to see better. This enhances your ability to look around and behind you. This is another aspect of our revolutionary design.Be seen and be safe.The highly reflective mirror finish has eye-catching style, allows easy maintenance, and has great visibility. You will let drivers know where you are by day and especially at night. Reflect the bustle of life.   The Celaris has an innovative frame that's hand-folded from aluminum and formed stainless steel sheet metal.

<h3>A Better Way to Travel</h3>
<p>""It's just a one-hour flight.""<br/><br/>Four hours later -- after getting up at 4 in the morning, struggling through traffic to the distant airport, winding through endless lines, being poked and prodded by security, sitting wedged in a 17-inch middle seat between two 20-inch fellow travelers -- you're standing curbside , waiting for your ride the last half hour downtown, feeling like you've already put in most of a day's work before even beginning.</p>
<p>There's a better way.</p>
<p>Dreamstar Lines is developing a premium overnight passenger rail service between selected major city pairs. We focus on the sweet spot for our service -- the ""500-mile gap"" that's too far to drive, too near to fly, but exactly one good night's sleep apart in a rolling hotel.</p>
<p>This isn't your grandparents' sleeping car -- but they'd wish it was.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help us obtain the critical access agreements to track and terminals that will enable us to be up and rolling by 2019.  In return, we'd love to invite you to ride our first route -- Los Angeles to San Francisco -- at an exclusive early-bird price.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Trains need to run on tracks. We don't own any, so we need access to tracks owned by others. We are in negotiations with the owners of tracks and terminals for access agreements.</p>
<p>Identifying how we can run without interfering with existing train movements takes expert analysis, which costs money.  We need roughly $80,000 in funding to enable us to achieve this critical milestone. </p>
<p>Once achieved, that opens the way for the additional investments we need to begin service. We're working with our manufacturers to finalize the design of our luxury double-deck sleeping cars and our vendors to provide first class service, and with federal agencies in connection with low-cost public and/or guaranteed financing for our rolling stock.</p>
<p>Your contribution will have a double effect. Beyond the funds alone, your contributions will demonstrate the demand for this service.  We've done market research and found an overwhelmingly positive response -- but nothing beats a pre-order.  We don't just want funders -- we want customers.  If we can point to a few thousand riders willing to put their money where their enthusiasm is, that's great momentum.</p>
<p>So in return for your contribution, you'll receive an overnight ride on the first Dreamstar route -- ""Dreamstar Somnium"" -- from Los Angeles Union Station to downtown San Francisco.  Depending on what you contribute, you'll enjoy a private roomette, executive bedroom, queen stateroom, first-class suite, or even the top-of-the-line Tycoon Suite.<br/><br/>Plus a hat.  Everybody needs another hat.</p>
<p>We are targeting a launch date of July 2019.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Personal Invitation:</h3>
<p>Four years ago, I had a series of morning meetings in the San Francisco Bay area. I quickly found out there's no easy way to get there for those. Yes, it's a one-and-a-half hour flight -- but that time in the air (climbing to 30,000 feet and then almost immediately heading right back down again) is bookended by hours of ground time, none of it pleasant.<br/><br/>I wondered if there was a better way.</p>
<p>I looked at Amtrak -- but while they do run overnight routes, there's none along the California coast (the existing service is a 14-hour daytime run to the East Bay, which takes too long). When I asked them why, they explained that Amtrak (though it makes valiant efforts to maintain a national rail network) simply doesn't have the resources to expand any additional long-distance services, particularly in the face of determined political opposition against subsidized rail.<br/><br/>Now, it's all well and good to ""dream of things that never were, and ask why not?"" But the ""why not?"" can't be a rhetorical question. There's often a very good reason why not.<br/><br/>But here -- after extensive, diligent, skeptical effort to find out why a service like ours doesn't already exist -- we can conclude that there is no good reason why it shouldn't.  The demand for the service evidently exists, and the costs can be kept manageable.  (We've been pleasantly surprised more than once to find our cost estimates were too high.)</p>
<p>We started this project because, quite simply, we wanted to use it. We want you to contribute because we think you'll love it, too.</p>

<p>3. Adoption. The ultimate risk is simply this: Will enough people ride with us?

""It's just a one-hour flight.""Four hours later -- after getting up at 4 in the morning, struggling through traffic to the distant airport, winding through endless lines, being poked and prodded by security, sitting wedged in a 17-inch middle seat between two 20-inch fellow travelers -- you're standing curbside , waiting for your ride the last half hour downtown, feeling like you've already put in most of a day's work before even beginning.
There's a better way.
Dreamstar Lines is developing a premium overnight passenger rail service between selected major city pairs. We focus on the sweet spot for our service -- the ""500-mile gap"" that's too far to drive, too near to fly, but exactly one good night's sleep apart in a rolling hotel.
This isn't your grandparents' sleeping car -- but they'd wish it was.
Your contribution will help us obtain the critical access agreements to track and terminals that will enable us to be up and rolling by 2019.  In return, we'd love to invite you to ride our first route -- Los Angeles to San Francisco -- at an exclusive early-bird price.

What We Need & What You Get
Trains need to run on tracks. We don't own any, so we need access to tracks owned by others. We are in negotiations with the owners of tracks and terminals for access agreements.
Identifying how we can run without interfering with existing train movements takes expert analysis, which costs money.  We need roughly $80,000 in funding to enable us to achieve this critical milestone. 
Once achieved, that opens the way for the additional investments we need to begin service. We're working with our manufacturers to finalize the design of our luxury double-deck sleeping cars and our vendors to provide first class service, and with federal agencies in connection with low-cost public and/or guaranteed financing for our rolling stock.
Your contribution will have a double effect. Beyond the funds alone, your contributions will demonstrate the demand for this service.  We've done market research and found an overwhelmingly positive response -- but nothing beats a pre-order.  We don't just want funders -- we want customers.  If we can point to a few thousand riders willing to put their money where their enthusiasm is, that's great momentum.
So in return for your contribution, you'll receive an overnight ride on the first Dreamstar route -- ""Dreamstar Somnium"" -- from Los Angeles Union Station to downtown San Francisco.  Depending on what you contribute, you'll enjoy a private roomette, executive bedroom, queen stateroom, first-class suite, or even the top-of-the-line Tycoon Suite.Plus a hat.  Everybody needs another hat.
We are targeting a launch date of July 2019.

Personal Invitation:
Four years ago, I had a series of morning meetings in the San Francisco Bay area. I quickly found out there's no easy way to get there for those. Yes, it's a one-and-a-half hour flight -- but that time in the air (climbing to 30,000 feet and then almost immediately heading right back down again) is bookended by hours of ground time, none of it pleasant.I wondered if there was a better way.
I looked at Amtrak -- but while they do run overnight routes, there's none along the California coast (the existing service is a 14-hour daytime run to the East Bay, which takes too long). When I asked them why, they explained that Amtrak (though it makes valiant efforts to maintain a national rail network) simply doesn't have the resources to expand any additional long-distance services, particularly in the face of determined political opposition against subsidized rail.Now, it's all well and good to ""dream of things that never were, and ask why not?"" But the ""why not?"" can't be a rhetorical question. There's often a very good reason why not.But here -- after extensive, diligent, skeptical effort to find out why a service like ours doesn't already exist -- we can conclude that there is no good reason why it shouldn't.  The demand for the service evidently exists, and the costs can be kept manageable.  (We've been pleasantly surprised more than once to find our cost estimates were too high.)
We started this project because, quite simply, we wanted to use it. We want you to contribute because we think you'll love it, too.
Somewhere between six and twenty percent of the public has an aversion to flying. I'm not one of them (particularly if I can get a window seat -- I'm still pretty much a kid that way). But a ""short hop"" flight involves a lot more driving and standing around and being manhandled than flying. All of us deserve another option.So does the earth.

<h2>Trefecta closes the Indiegogo campaign early but nonetheless successfully.</h2>
<p><strong>Trefecta will close the crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo. Since the launch of the Trefecta RDR, it appears that Indiegogo is not geared to a product in the higher price range and interested dealers and patrons encountered problems with payments.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As such Trefecta now invites our loyal Indiegogo customers to order directly from Trefecta B.V. once Indiegogo has refunded you (within 5 business days after the campaign closes). We will be able to offer a range of payment options including an instalment plan, this way we can avoid any payment issues as suffered with Indiegogo.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strong interest in our Trefecta RDR overall and the instalment option in particular has led to the potential achievement of our minimum goal of 25 Trefecta RDR eBikes sold. Naturally, we will need all our patrons to make the switch in order to achieve it. Our apologies for the inconvenience this causes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Because of the success, we can continue to build our order book directly with our customers via the special Trefecta RDR website. There you will find all the information you need and you can fill-out an order form with your details and which Trefecta RDR package you prefer. After submission we will contact you directly to discuss further details and payment options.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We want to thank everyone who has contributed to achieving our goal and for anyone who has not yet ordered a Trefecta RDR, please visit the <a href=""https://rdr.trefectamobility.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RDR.TrefectaMobility.com</a> website and order your RDR now!</strong></p>

<p>The new Trefecta RDR uses either a 250w, 500w or 920w mid-drive motor from German brand TQ. Whichever power output you choose there’s a stunning 120Nm of torque available. That’s more than twice what most mid-drive motors will provide.</p>

<h3>Unmatched Design</h3>
<p>We have chosen to finish the Trefecta RDR's in natural aluminium, the upper frame untreated while the powertrain is finished in matt black. Aluminium is a durable and fully recyclable material that forms its own protection through natural oxidation, thus giving a wonderful patina through life. A nod to classic racing motorcycles of yesteryear that had aluminium fuel tanks, thereby building a fun yet sustainable bridge between our past and our future mobility requirements.</p>

</div></div>","Trefecta closes the Indiegogo campaign early but nonetheless successfully.
Trefecta will close the crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo. Since the launch of the Trefecta RDR, it appears that Indiegogo is not geared to a product in the higher price range and interested dealers and patrons encountered problems with payments.
As such Trefecta now invites our loyal Indiegogo customers to order directly from Trefecta B.V. once Indiegogo has refunded you (within 5 business days after the campaign closes). We will be able to offer a range of payment options including an instalment plan, this way we can avoid any payment issues as suffered with Indiegogo.
Strong interest in our Trefecta RDR overall and the instalment option in particular has led to the potential achievement of our minimum goal of 25 Trefecta RDR eBikes sold. Naturally, we will need all our patrons to make the switch in order to achieve it. Our apologies for the inconvenience this causes.
Because of the success, we can continue to build our order book directly with our customers via the special Trefecta RDR website. There you will find all the information you need and you can fill-out an order form with your details and which Trefecta RDR package you prefer. After submission we will contact you directly to discuss further details and payment options.
We want to thank everyone who has contributed to achieving our goal and for anyone who has not yet ordered a Trefecta RDR, please visit the RDR.TrefectaMobility.com website and order your RDR now!
 
The Trefecta RDR Go anywhere, do anything
The Trefecta RDR is the ideal eBike to take on a challenging off-road trail and yet with the road kit installed the RDR is the fast and relaxed solution for your every day inter-urban commutes. The Trefecta RDR offers you best value based on Performance, Range and Design without compromising on the values the Trefecta brand is known for since 2012: offering you the ultimate riding experience with the freedom to go where you want, when you want.
 

Trefecta’s aim is to create the game, instead of changing it. By focusing on true innovation we create the norm and set the standard for the products of tomorrow. We are very proud to introduce the new Trefecta RDR speed pedelec, a more affordable version of our famous Trefecta DRT Pro race pedelec. The bike has been designed to tackle almost any terrain and to transport you in style thanks to sophisticated suspension and styling, a powerful motor with unusually long range (due to a large battery).
The Trefecta RDR represents the culmination of 7 years work to develop and produce an eBike powerful and durable enough for international military peacekeeping and professional use. The goal is to lock-in and secure the final investment needed to bring the core technologies developed to the consumer market in serial production.
The range of special perks on offer is highlighted by the Trefecta RDR ABS RK (10 units available at this special offer first come first served price) offering extraordinary value for money.

<p>I’ve started and run multiple businesses before, and even sold one to Apple Computer. So I know what it takes to carry through on all the big and little tasks to get a company going. And we at Booster Batteries know electric vehicles are the future and we want to be a big part of that.</p>
<p>As an engineer, I love finding solutions to problems. Especially when those solutions can really make a difference in people’s lives. So when I heard of biking friends being stranded miles from home with a dead battery or having to push up a long hill because their battery wasn’t powerful enough, I wanted to find a perfect solution. Bigger batteries are available, but they’re VERY expensive. Plus it seemed wasteful to replace the expensive existing stock battery and replace it with something even more expensive.</p>
<p>So why not just add to the existing stock battery instead? Just like adding an extra battery to a flashlight to make the bulb burn brighter, a Booster Battery connected to the stock battery can add more power or greater range. </p>
<p>To get our first round of distribution we’ll need at least $20k. That will give us the final testing and certification we need to start shipping product. Any extra funds raised will allow us to add additional perks and start making Booster Batteries for more varieties of eBikes. Even if we don’t make our $20k goal, we’ll still be shipping out our perks. Remember, we already have factory samples of Booster Batteries and are currently finalizing production.</p>
<p>Our first perks are Booster Batteries that fit right inside the triangle frame box of the very popular Sondors eBikes. We have both Power Boosters - that provide more hill-climbing power - and Range Boosters - that allow the bikes to go a greater distance on a single charge. These Booster Batteries will come with everything needed to connect up to the existing Sondors battery, including all cables and even a special charger for the Power Booster.</p>
<p>We’ll also offer a solar charger that can be used to recharge the Power Booster off sunlight alone, so it’s perfect keeping your eBike charged while camping. This solar charger can also be kept on the dashboard of a car to help keep your car battery fully charged and ready during periods when the car isn’t used - such as in an airport parking lot.</p>
<p>We’ll be adding other perks over time to help make your Sondors eBike more usable. Such as hard-to-find items like gearing and racks and fenders. But we’ll soon add additional booster batteries for other bikes, skateboards, wheelchairs, and maybe someday even for cars!</p>
<p>Even if you don’t have a Sondors, or even an eBike, yet, you can still help us in the push to get more people out of cars and onto bikes. With an eBike, even injuries or bad hips and knees can’t stop you from getting where you’re going. Please use the share tools on this site to get the word out!</p>

<h3>About Rydiah Rhoden</h3>
<p>My name is Rydiah Rhoden, I am a freshman biology major at Clark Atlanta University. I am  18 years old and I'm from Philadelphia,PA. Here at CAU I founded two businesses RyDesignz and Rydes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About Rydes</strong></p>
<ul><li>Rydes is a ride-share business created specifically for college students. At this moment we're only based in the Atlanta University Center ( Clark Atlanta University, Spelman College and Morehouse College) I started Rydes last semester as a Freshman at Clark Atlanta University. The reason I started Rydes was because one of my closest friends told me how much they were paying to go back and forth to work each day. She was working to pay off her school fees and as a college student I know that it's very important to save money.  Soon after starting Rydes, other students started asking for Rydes as well and that's when I realized that students are actually looking for a cheaper way to travel- especially students within the AUC  where more than half of the students are from out of state. </li></ul>
<p><i><strong>How did it work? </strong></i></p>
<p>Last semester, AUC Students would text me with their pickup and drop-off location and the number of passengers. I would then give them an estimate for their Ryde, I would pick them up...drop them off and even wait for them if needed. </p>
<p>This semester, because the demand for Rydes is increasing, I've been holding informational sessions and recruiting other students to become a driver. While in the process of hiring other students, I realized that it's very difficult to connect Ryders with drivers without the development of an app. I'm not always available to respond to text messages this semester due to my academic schedule and I do not want to give up on this idea because so many students actually need transportation off campus. As an out of state student myself,  I know not to go anywhere alone and I often have to look over my shoulder, </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<ul>
<li>After speaking with several app developers the estimated price to develop an app is between $10,0000-$20,000</li>
<li>If i do not reach my entire goal, I will put the funds into a business account for Rydes and continue to raise funds by hosting a series of fundraising events on and off campus. </li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>My first time completing a Ryde was on October 21st, 2017! Since then, Rydes have been going through a lot of trials and tribulations, there were days where we received no Rydes at all and there were days when I wanted to give up on the idea as a whole- but I didn't. As Rydes continues to expand, I know that there will be a lot more risks and challenges, but I am willing to grow and learn from these challenges. Rydes is something I am extremely passionate about, it's not for me it's for my peers and other college students. I know that this is a great Idea and I really hope that others can see it too. </p>

With more than 220 million registered drivers in the U.S., turning these small changes in individual behavior into habits would produce major improvements in safety, air quality, and environmental health that benefit us all.</p><p><strong>Developing Our App — Where the Rubber Meets the Road for Driving2Save</strong></p><p>As our community members have told us, and we know from experience, it is hard to remember everything we need to do to save money, drive safer, and reduce our emissions.

By issuing real-time alerts, the App will enable drivers to take immediate corrective action to increase their safety and improve their fuel economy.</p><p>If there is a child and/or a pet in the car, the App will issue a post-drive reminder to make sure you do not leave either of them unattended in the car.</p><p><strong>Post-Drive Reports</strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549735461/hqvw5qo13zxbvbkfncui.jpg"" src=""""/></strong>After your drive, the App will issue you a digital “report card” that grades your drive, notes your achievements, and lists the corrective alerts that were issued during your drive.  With a tap of your finger, you can get detailed information on each aspect of your drive.  The report reinforces good driving habits and ensures drivers identify areas for improvement.  The report can also be shared automatically with third parties.</p><p><strong>Positive Feedback</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549735920/oacbyi1o3asr6ygetxfe.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Although corrective alerts are important, a positive user experience combined with positive feedback will ensure that drivers continue to use the App and realize all the financial, health and safety, and environmental benefits of doing so.

Parents can automatically receive a report via email every time their teen finishes a drive. And because the teen knows that every drive is being monitored, he or she is likely to drive much more responsibly. If a parent does not receive a driving report from their teen driver following a drive, this means the teen has either removed the parent from his or her sharing list or elected not to use the App in conjunction with a particular drive. Either way, the failure to receive a report alerts a parent to potentially irresponsible driving by their teen driver.   </p><p><strong>The App has other health and safety benefits for parents and their children as well.</strong></p><p style=""width:40%;float:left;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549835625/vee0cv5jvnwkzpli4bde.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>When sitting in traffic, the air inside our cars contains extraordinary levels of pollution.

This is not only a safety hazard, but it substantially reduces fuel economy, costing them an extra $60/year on gas and reducing the life of their tires. It takes two minutes every two weeks to avoid these costs by checking tire pressure.  The Driving2Save App supplies the necessary reminder.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Anyone who wants to save money</strong></p><p>In addition to saving drivers money on gas and vehicle maintenance, the App can also help them save money on car insurance. There are now many insurance providers that use Apps or sensors to monitor their insureds’ driving. For responsible drivers, this often results in a substantial reduction in their premiums. The Driving2Save App has been designed to alert drivers to behaviors that would be considered risky by many insurers. Thus, drivers who consistently avoid triggering corrective alerts from the Driving2Save App, and who participate in a monitoring program with their insurance company, could <a href=""https://driving2save.com/picking-the-right-car-insurance-if-you-are-driving2save/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">substantially reduce their insurance premiums</a>.</p><p><strong>Eco-Conscious Drivers</strong></p><p>If you drive a gas-powered car, the best way to be more eco-conscious is to increase your fuel economy, which will reduce your particulate matter and greenhouse gas emissions.  The Driving2Save App has many features designed to save you money and help you save the planet by increasing your MPG.</p><p style=""width:40%;float:left;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549852849/y7lp0ry8fpuugousf1k4.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Unnecessary idling is one of the worst driving behaviors for your pocketbook and our planet:  You burn gas and produce emissions without actually moving. It is the driving equivalent of leaving all the lights on in your empty house.  And just like leaving the lights on unintentionally, many of us idle inadvertently several times a week, including when we start our car before we are ready to drive and when we wait in our car with the engine running before picking up a child or spouse. The Driving2Save App will prevent this by monitoring vehicle speed and distance.  If it detects excessive idling, it will issue an alert.</p><h3>The World’s Most Useful Driving App</h3><p><strong>The Driving2Save App delivers in ways that other Apps cannot.</strong></p><ul>
<li>By including vehicle maintenance and other pre-drive reminders, and issuing real-time audio driving alerts, the Driving2Save App includes more features and functionality to promote safe and efficient driving than other driving Apps.</li>
<li>Enabling users to select functions and feedback mechanisms, the App serves as a valued assistant rather than a backseat driver, eliminating the unpleasant user experience that has plagued many first-generation safe driving Apps.  </li>
<li>Explicitly protecting driver data, users do not have to worry that their information is being shared with insurance companies and other third parties.  </li>
<li>Reducing operations and maintenance costs, the App will more than pay for itself.</li>
</ul><p>With these and other features, and the ability to add functionality over time, the Driving2Save App will enable anyone who is interested in protecting his or her family, saving money, or helping the environment to become a more conscientious driver. And by building a community of conscientious drivers, we can have an enormously positive <strong><i>impact </i></strong>on health, safety, and the environment. For all these reasons, the Driving2Save App will be the world’s most useful driving App. </p><h3>We Need Your Help to Develop this Amazing App</h3><p>We need to raise $95,900 to develop this App and improve the lives of drivers everywhere.

Thank you for your support!</p></div>","Our MissionDriving2Save was founded in October 2017 to build a brighter future by creating and empowering a community of conscientious drivers.This is an increasingly important mission because each year in the U.S.:Since our founding, we have leveraged our online and social media platforms to encourage tens of thousands of drivers to make small changes in their behavior that can substantially reduce their risks on the road and save them hundreds of dollars per year.  We want to make an even greater impact. With more than 220 million registered drivers in the U.S., turning these small changes in individual behavior into habits would produce major improvements in safety, air quality, and environmental health that benefit us all.Developing Our App — Where the Rubber Meets the Road for Driving2SaveAs our community members have told us, and we know from experience, it is hard to remember everything we need to do to save money, drive safer, and reduce our emissions. The Driving2Save App will make it easy for everyone to develop better driving habits by providing drivers with customized and timely reminders, real-time alerts, and post-drive feedback. The Driving2Save App will improve lives and substantially increase our positive impact.How it WorksSet-Up Is EasyDuring set-up, you will answer questions that allow you to customize the App to match your car, routines, and feedback preferences.  With the App, you will get an assistant rather than a backseat driver. Using the App Is Even EasierPre-Drive PromptsBefore you get behind the wheel, the App will give you the option of checking traffic and picking a route to save time, aggravation, and gas.  At various intervals, it will also remind you to check your tire pressure, remove excess weight from your car, and remove your unused roof rack (if you have one) in order to improve safety and fuel economy.  If you have a child and/or a pet, the App will ask whether they are coming with you to ensure they are not left unattended at the end of the drive.Driving AlertsDuring your drive, the App will monitor acceleration and braking (and several other driving characteristics) for behavior that reduces fuel economy and/or poses safety risks.  Based on your preferences, the App will issue a real-time audio alert (to avoid distracted driving) each time it detects certain behavior, such as: overly aggressive acceleration; severe braking; or excessive speed.  (The alert will also be briefly displayed on the screen as a backup notification). By issuing real-time alerts, the App will enable drivers to take immediate corrective action to increase their safety and improve their fuel economy.If there is a child and/or a pet in the car, the App will issue a post-drive reminder to make sure you do not leave either of them unattended in the car.Post-Drive ReportsAfter your drive, the App will issue you a digital “report card” that grades your drive, notes your achievements, and lists the corrective alerts that were issued during your drive.  With a tap of your finger, you can get detailed information on each aspect of your drive.  The report reinforces good driving habits and ensures drivers identify areas for improvement.  The report can also be shared automatically with third parties.Positive FeedbackAlthough corrective alerts are important, a positive user experience combined with positive feedback will ensure that drivers continue to use the App and realize all the financial, health and safety, and environmental benefits of doing so. The App has several mechanisms for providing positive feedback, including: 
Highlighting when your gas mileage exceeds the EPA Combined Estimate (which means you are saving money on gas and reducing your emissions);
Celebrating milestones and achievements and making it easy to share them on social media; and
Displaying your driving trends so that you can see your progress over time.  
The App’s Features Deliver Significant Savings,Safety and Environmental BenefitsThe App is Perfect For:ParentsThe health and safety of our children is our number one concern as parents, and the App has many features that can help us keep them safe and provide us with peace of mind, from correcting our aggressive driving behavior, to ensuring we do not leave a child unattended in a car, to monitoring teen driving.The App has been designed to provide peace of mind to parents of teen drivers (like our Founder): The report sharing function is ideal for parents who want to monitor how safely their teens are driving. Parents can automatically receive a report via email every time their teen finishes a drive. And because the teen knows that every drive is being monitored, he or she is likely to drive much more responsibly. If a parent does not receive a driving report from their teen driver following a drive, this means the teen has either removed the parent from his or her sharing list or elected not to use the App in conjunction with a particular drive. Either way, the failure to receive a report alerts a parent to potentially irresponsible driving by their teen driver.   The App has other health and safety benefits for parents and their children as well.When sitting in traffic, the air inside our cars contains extraordinary levels of pollution. This pollution has been linked to asthma and other respiratory illnesses, and is especially harmful to children and the elderly.  With so many parents driving their children to and from school and extra-curricular activities in heavy traffic, it is critical that they take steps to reduce the pollution in their cars. The best way to do this is to recirculate the air. The App will monitor vehicle sped over time and issue an alert to recirculate the air whenever it determines the vehicle is likely sitting in traffic. Pet OwnersJust as no child should be left unattended in a hot car, nor should any pet.The App will remind drivers to take their pets with them after they have parked their cars.Anyone who drives their own car for a livingIf you drive your own car for a living, the more it costs you to operate and maintain your car, the less money you take home. The App helps you save money on gas and certain maintenance costs. It also improves your safety on the roads, which is especially important if you are responsible for the well-being of passengers.Even with Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS) included in all cars for the past decade, many drivers still drive on underinflated tires because they drive older cars or their TPMS does not show individual tire pressure (and only alerts when pressure is catastrophically low). This is not only a safety hazard, but it substantially reduces fuel economy, costing them an extra $60/year on gas and reducing the life of their tires. It takes two minutes every two weeks to avoid these costs by checking tire pressure.  The Driving2Save App supplies the necessary reminder. Anyone who wants to save moneyIn addition to saving drivers money on gas and vehicle maintenance, the App can also help them save money on car insurance. There are now many insurance providers that use Apps or sensors to monitor their insureds’ driving. For responsible drivers, this often results in a substantial reduction in their premiums. The Driving2Save App has been designed to alert drivers to behaviors that would be considered risky by many insurers. Thus, drivers who consistently avoid triggering corrective alerts from the Driving2Save App, and who participate in a monitoring program with their insurance company, could substantially reduce their insurance premiums.Eco-Conscious DriversIf you drive a gas-powered car, the best way to be more eco-conscious is to increase your fuel economy, which will reduce your particulate matter and greenhouse gas emissions.  The Driving2Save App has many features designed to save you money and help you save the planet by increasing your MPG.Unnecessary idling is one of the worst driving behaviors for your pocketbook and our planet:  You burn gas and produce emissions without actually moving. It is the driving equivalent of leaving all the lights on in your empty house.  And just like leaving the lights on unintentionally, many of us idle inadvertently several times a week, including when we start our car before we are ready to drive and when we wait in our car with the engine running before picking up a child or spouse. The Driving2Save App will prevent this by monitoring vehicle speed and distance.  If it detects excessive idling, it will issue an alert.The World’s Most Useful Driving AppThe Driving2Save App delivers in ways that other Apps cannot.
By including vehicle maintenance and other pre-drive reminders, and issuing real-time audio driving alerts, the Driving2Save App includes more features and functionality to promote safe and efficient driving than other driving Apps.
Enabling users to select functions and feedback mechanisms, the App serves as a valued assistant rather than a backseat driver, eliminating the unpleasant user experience that has plagued many first-generation safe driving Apps.  
Explicitly protecting driver data, users do not have to worry that their information is being shared with insurance companies and other third parties.  
Reducing operations and maintenance costs, the App will more than pay for itself.
With these and other features, and the ability to add functionality over time, the Driving2Save App will enable anyone who is interested in protecting his or her family, saving money, or helping the environment to become a more conscientious driver. And by building a community of conscientious drivers, we can have an enormously positive impact on health, safety, and the environment. For all these reasons, the Driving2Save App will be the world’s most useful driving App. We Need Your Help to Develop this Amazing AppWe need to raise $95,900 to develop this App and improve the lives of drivers everywhere.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Driver's Elbow Pad is a patent-pending ""elbow pillow"" for long-distance drivers to be more comfortable and less distracted by pain (even if only momentarily), therefore safer. When long distance drivers ""rest"" their arm on the door's window frame and rotate their arm to safely hold the steering wheel with both hands, this position exposes the Ulnar Nerve, normally concealed inside the elbow. It is then exposed to bumpy roads and ""torsional vibrations"" of the engine pistons firing thousands of times per minute, which causes the door to vibrate slightly but non-stop.

<p>Surveys at random truck stops reported that <strong>56%</strong> of truck drivers have experienced this pain but often don't report it to managers or medical staff due to fear of having their hours cut.

That is the reason for us to develop Taxie®. Our design allows transportation like Taxi and Uber to carry a child car seat all the time. Children between 15months to 12 years old will protect at the latest ECE-R129 standard.Taxie® by Trafold® created to help drivers provide a better service. Taxie® designed for children of 76cm and above with a scalable product the size of a piece of hand luggage. Just unlock the base, flip it over, adjust the headrest, and you are good to go. When you finish, simply fold it back up and store it in the boot – leaving plenty of room for passenger luggage. 


 


  Award-winning DesignA professional car seat needed to design for children of different height and weight. We carefully designed the car seat and tried hard to provide the best protection during impacts from different directions. We first study children in every age level and use that data to design the car seat then we use the computer impact simulation technology widely used in the automobile industry to improve and fine-tune the structure and design.Therefore, we designed Safe-T® Clamp and Safe-T® Wing Safe-T® Clampnot only effectively hold car seat onto the vehicle seat, but also can use hold the build-in child seat belt in place while being used as a booster seat.Safe-T® Winglocated on both sides of the car seat, allow the car seat to adjust its side protection volume without weakening car seat protection structure. So that all children over 76cm will be protected.Moreover, we removed all unnecessary steps for installation, and the result is Taxie® is 25% quicker to install.Taxie® is a foldable child safety seat designed for taxis and cabbies.We see there is growing concern about the hygiene of public transport, and that lead us to develop Safe-T® Shield protection. Safe-T® ShieldTaxie®'s unique Safe.T® Shield application on child car seats. Keeps taxi drivers and passengers safe. Trafold® has developed Safe.t® Shield and incorporated it into the Taxie® child car seat. But how can this work? 1. The integral bacterial and fungal protection2. Easy clean coating3. Night Safety Feature

Safe-T® Shield Sanitized hygiene seat stops bacteria and fungi spreading, and it's very easy to clean.
 Compare to other child car seats* Taxie® by Trafold® is a convertible child car seat that has been designed and engineered to comply with worldwide regulatory standards. On delivery, Taxie® will comply with UN ECE R129/03 for most countries.Taxie® is the smallest ECE-R129 child car seat with the dimension 304x551x440mm (12x21.7x17.3inch)


Installation for a child over 95cm



Installation for a toddler under 105cm

 Test and Risk Taxie® has been tested based on the ECE-R129 standard, and we are confident to go into production to prepare for the final test.With the early help from the Automotive Research & Testing Center (ARTC) and now our Computer Aid Engineer analyzes specialist, Taxie® professional car seat has pass CAE test on both front/rear/side-impact requirement stated in ECE-R129. CAE is a professional tool that widely uses in the automobile industry.

<p>The stock EBR 1190RX/SX cylinders are made of nicasil-coated aluminum. This is a very heat-efficient material, but not the strongest you can put in the cylinder. Spun-cast ductile iron is much stronger, especially in the areas where the EBR cylinders are cracking.</p>

<h3><strong>ESPAÑOL</strong></h3>
<p>Mi nombre es Carlos Casallas, tengo 34 años de edad, soy técnico automotriz, trabajo en mecánica hace 17 años, vivo en Bogotá Colombia, me apasionan los vehículos y es necesario un cambio de conciencia pensando en el cuidado del medio ambiente para no seguir contaminando, eso me llama la atención de los <strong>VEHÍCULOS ELÉCTRICOS</strong> ya que es una tecnología más limpia e innovadora, <strong>CON TU AYUDA</strong> queremos realizar la conversión de un vehículo prototipo e impulsar estas conversiones en mi país.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3><strong>¿QUÉ ESTAMOS BUSCANDO?</strong></h3>
<p>Necesitamos <strong>USD 20.000</strong> para un <strong>vehículo eléctrico prototipo</strong>, este dinero será invertido de esta forma:</p>
</div>

<li>Gastos de importación e impuestos. USD 2.000</li>
<li>Modificación de la licencia del vehículo para cambiar el tipo de combustible a ""Eléctrico"". USD 300</li>
<li>Fabricación de soportes para motor y baterías, fabricación del acople del motor eléctrico. USD 2.200<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503118412/mrjjid03z5tdcxxyritu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</li>
<li>Compra de cables de conexión, contactores, relés y demás accesorios. USD 1.000</li>
<li>Pago de arriendo de taller (servicios, herramienta y mano de obra). USD 1.500</li>
<li>Imprevistos. USD 1.000</li>
</ul>
<p>Si estás en Colombia <strong>con tu donación puedes participar</strong> en todo el proceso de la conversión :), si estás en otro país y si quieres puedes recibir todo el registro de video y fotográfico del proceso de la conversión en tiempo real :)</p>
<p>Si no se recauda el dinero completo, se buscarán inversionistas externos para completar el dinero y llevar a cabo la conversión del vehículo prototipo.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>¿QUÉ IMPACTO TIENE TU APORTE?</h3>
<p>¿Sabías que mueren más de <strong>17.000</strong> personas diarias en el mundo por la contaminación ambiental?, pero en <strong>5</strong> años de usar un vehículo eléctrico se ha dejado de emitir al medio ambiente más de <strong>20.000</strong> kilos de gases contaminantes, con tu ayuda en este proyecto estás contribuyendo a disminuir este número de muertes.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503118757/hdmjatz7jcx3zeuluthb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Riesgos y desafíos </h3>
<p>Hay un riesgo inicial y es no conseguir los recursos económicos completos para la conversión del vehículo prototipo, en este caso el plan B es buscar inversión externa.</p>
<p>Hay un desafío y es que en mi país Colombia no hay mucha conciencia ambiental lo cual representa trabajo para que las personas interioricen esta visión.</p>
<p>Otro desafío es que los precios de la conversión inician en <strong>USD 8.000</strong> y hay que trabajar en que las personas comprendan que son más las ventajas que las desventajas como el ahorro de dinero en combustible y en mantenimiento.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Otras formas en las que puedes ayudar</h3>
<p>Ayúdanos a difundir esta campaña en caso que no puedas aportar económicamente para que más personas puedan apoyar una forma real de cuidar el medio ambiente.</p>

</div></div>","ESPAÑOL
Mi nombre es Carlos Casallas, tengo 34 años de edad, soy técnico automotriz, trabajo en mecánica hace 17 años, vivo en Bogotá Colombia, me apasionan los vehículos y es necesario un cambio de conciencia pensando en el cuidado del medio ambiente para no seguir contaminando, eso me llama la atención de los VEHÍCULOS ELÉCTRICOS ya que es una tecnología más limpia e innovadora, CON TU AYUDA queremos realizar la conversión de un vehículo prototipo e impulsar estas conversiones en mi país.
 

¿QUÉ ESTAMOS BUSCANDO?
Necesitamos USD 20.000 para un vehículo eléctrico prototipo, este dinero será invertido de esta forma:



Compra de vehículo a convertir. USD 2.000

Compra de baterias de litio, motor eléctrico y accesorios importados desde China. USD 10.000

Gastos de importación e impuestos. USD 2.000
Modificación de la licencia del vehículo para cambiar el tipo de combustible a ""Eléctrico"". USD 300
Fabricación de soportes para motor y baterías, fabricación del acople del motor eléctrico. USD 2.200

Compra de cables de conexión, contactores, relés y demás accesorios. USD 1.000
Pago de arriendo de taller (servicios, herramienta y mano de obra). USD 1.500
Imprevistos. USD 1.000

Si estás en Colombia con tu donación puedes participar en todo el proceso de la conversión :), si estás en otro país y si quieres puedes recibir todo el registro de video y fotográfico del proceso de la conversión en tiempo real :)
Si no se recauda el dinero completo, se buscarán inversionistas externos para completar el dinero y llevar a cabo la conversión del vehículo prototipo.
 

¿QUÉ IMPACTO TIENE TU APORTE?
¿Sabías que mueren más de 17.000 personas diarias en el mundo por la contaminación ambiental?, pero en 5 años de usar un vehículo eléctrico se ha dejado de emitir al medio ambiente más de 20.000 kilos de gases contaminantes, con tu ayuda en este proyecto estás contribuyendo a disminuir este número de muertes.
 
Riesgos y desafíos 
Hay un riesgo inicial y es no conseguir los recursos económicos completos para la conversión del vehículo prototipo, en este caso el plan B es buscar inversión externa.
Hay un desafío y es que en mi país Colombia no hay mucha conciencia ambiental lo cual representa trabajo para que las personas interioricen esta visión.
Otro desafío es que los precios de la conversión inician en USD 8.000 y hay que trabajar en que las personas comprendan que son más las ventajas que las desventajas como el ahorro de dinero en combustible y en mantenimiento.
 
Otras formas en las que puedes ayudar
Ayúdanos a difundir esta campaña en caso que no puedas aportar económicamente para que más personas puedan apoyar una forma real de cuidar el medio ambiente.
Si requieres más información con gusto será otorgada.

<p>Overview</p>
<p>Capricorn X is the world’s first carbon battery integrated, foldable, electric bike. Capricorn X envisions and captures the heart of the global capital of technology and bicycle metropolis: Tokyo, Japan. Since 2014, our technology provider PJP Eye has researched and developed a carbon battery called ""Cambrian™""at their research center in Kyushu University: Fukuoka, Japan. This innovative battery is here to change the world, from Japan. The battery is made from organic materials but doesn't use rare metals which harm the earth making it recyclable.  The battery has a  life cycle of  more than 10,000 times compared to 3000 times in the case of Li-ion batteries. This is why we are proud to present the 10-year warranty on our battery.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587480830/ijmvegwrmuozljlkwlo3.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/><br/>The big feature of this battery for the e-bikes is Super RapidCharging Technology ™ Compared to other bikes out on the market whose charging time is more than 4 hours, our Capricorn only needs 20 min to get fully charged. You can then travel another 18 miles/30km easily with a top speed of 15 mph/25km/h!  In the time it takes for you to enjoy a cup of coffee, you recharge your bike back up to full power. Since our battery can accept large electric currents, with certain types of proprietary EV chargers, our Capricorn can be charged.</p>
<p>Not only the battery, but our Capricorn also has all the functions bikes need to have for daily use. Capricorn X changes the way you travel by the whole new level of convenience. </p>

<p>Lab6 emerged from the most innovative city in the world - Tokyo. Short for Laboratory 6, Lab6 was created to develop and distribute products using the world's most innovative technology - carbon battery, ""Cambrian™"". Cambrian was developed by PJP Eye Ltd. inherited business from Power Japan Plus famous for its Dual Carbon Battery. </p>

<p>Hiroaki Nishina, the chairman of Lab6 and CEO of PJP Eye LTD. runs two UN organizations in NYC. Nishina and PJP Eye's goal is to create a sustainable world with carbon battery ""Cambrian"". Currently our Capricorn integrates a single carbon battery inside, however  in the future we plan to mass produce dual carbon batteries. Our dream is to deliver electricity to anyone anywhere on this planet.</p>

At times it's been tough, but we've learned from our mistakes and emerged stronger. In particular, we’ve nailed two key areas the last year - manufacturing and logistics.  </p>

Capricorn X is the world’s first carbon battery integrated, foldable, electric bike. Capricorn X envisions and captures the heart of the global capital of technology and bicycle metropolis: Tokyo, Japan. Since 2014, our technology provider PJP Eye has researched and developed a carbon battery called ""Cambrian™""at their research center in Kyushu University: Fukuoka, Japan. This innovative battery is here to change the world, from Japan. The battery is made from organic materials but doesn't use rare metals which harm the earth making it recyclable.  The battery has a  life cycle of  more than 10,000 times compared to 3000 times in the case of Li-ion batteries. This is why we are proud to present the 10-year warranty on our battery.
 

The big feature of this battery for the e-bikes is Super RapidCharging Technology ™ Compared to other bikes out on the market whose charging time is more than 4 hours, our Capricorn only needs 20 min to get fully charged. You can then travel another 18 miles/30km easily with a top speed of 15 mph/25km/h!  In the time it takes for you to enjoy a cup of coffee, you recharge your bike back up to full power. Since our battery can accept large electric currents, with certain types of proprietary EV chargers, our Capricorn can be charged.
Not only the battery, but our Capricorn also has all the functions bikes need to have for daily use. Capricorn X changes the way you travel by the whole new level of convenience. 
 

 

 
Lab6 emerged from the most innovative city in the world - Tokyo. Short for Laboratory 6, Lab6 was created to develop and distribute products using the world's most innovative technology - carbon battery, ""Cambrian™"". Cambrian was developed by PJP Eye Ltd. inherited business from Power Japan Plus famous for its Dual Carbon Battery. 
 
 
 
Hiroaki Nishina, the chairman of Lab6 and CEO of PJP Eye LTD. runs two UN organizations in NYC. Nishina and PJP Eye's goal is to create a sustainable world with carbon battery ""Cambrian"". Currently our Capricorn integrates a single carbon battery inside, however  in the future we plan to mass produce dual carbon batteries. Our dream is to deliver electricity to anyone anywhere on this planet.
                          
For our first step, we intend to make everyday travel sustainable. Capricorn X is our first and best product offered right now in the market. 



 
We have completed mass production of Capricorn X and are currently optimizing parts, configurations, and logistics. To scale up the production, we have set a goal of $150,000 for this campaign. We want to give these bikes to everyone around the world so they can experience the ease of new technology. 
 

 
Everyone who  participates in our Super RapidCharging campaign will get it at least 20% off of the retail price – and will be the first to be offered a 10-year premium battery warranty for no charge.

A wise man once said that you need to fail and hit rock bottom before you can succeed. Although we haven't quite hit rock bottom, we definitely faced challenges. At times it's been tough, but we've learned from our mistakes and emerged stronger. In particular, we’ve nailed two key areas the last year - manufacturing and logistics.  
We're now ready and confident that all points from ordering to delivery will live up to expectations.
 

 
We’re not only building a bike or a brand but rather planting the seeds for a vision of a sustainable carbon future  with our backers. We’re constantly improving both the bikes and our own performance, listening to feedback intently.
In essence, our bikes are made by each one of you. Everyone who purchases a bike, gives us feedback and cuts down on global emissions is making a difference. Lab6 is creating a sustainable world: for everyone, built by everyone.
 

 
We won the Tech Rocketship Award from the British Embassy of Tokyo for the future of the mobility award 2020.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Let's Storm the Streets!</p>

<p>Thundrblade is a high quality carbon inline skate frame with a battery-powered motor inside. It has a wireless controller, swappable batteries and can be attached to your favorite inline skate boot. The frame fits two offroad wheels or LED wheels for evening fun.</p> <p>Thundrblade features a system of regenerative brakes that can be used even while skating without the motors on. Electric assist mode is in development as well. With it you can experience the thrill of speed without a drop of sweat as you carve through the streets.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525374421/gwts6ddrx9hytbiwv2mv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Electric inline skates: the pros</h2> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Thundrblade: the better powered option</h3>
<p>Deciding between skates and other powered last mile solutions? You don’t have to give up your favorite mode of transport anymore! Safer, easier to learn and more maneuverable on crowded streets, Thundrblade surpasses powered boards. Feel more in control (and don’t send a powered bullet of a board crashing into people or cars if you fall).</p> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Ride electric or not, it’s your choice!</h3>
<p>Thundrblade inline skate system is a hybrid - that means it will never leave you stranded without juice in the batteries. Ran out of spare batteries? Use it as normal skate! Switch between motors and your own power within seconds. Regen brakes naturally work in both cases.</p> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Batteries running low? Swap ‘em!</h3>
<p>Rather than a heavy big battery we went for lighter, swappable ones, so your feet are always light enough for your tricks or commute. Swapping the battery doesn’t require tools and can be done on the go.</p>

<h3>It's about time</h3>
<p>E-boards have been on the market for over a decade and e-skates are still nowhere to be found. Let's put inline skating back on the map!</p>
<p>Since Thundrblade is actually easier to skate than normal inline skates, it has the potential to appeal to people that would never skate otherwise. We will take inline skating to people that have never skated before.</p>
<p>We've had test riders with no previous skating experience being able to ride Thundrblade in about 10 minutes on average.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Back Thundrblade today</h2>
<p>We have been working hard, with no funds or fancy tools, for the past 2 years to bring this dream to reality. More than 20 prototypes and countless tests later, we have a great prototype. Now is the time to show the world that skating is the best way to move around, both for leisure and transportation! For that, we need funding, and only you can help us make this happen! Back us or refer us to friends, and then storm the streets on Thundrblades!</p>

<p><strong>Q: Can I skate normally with Thundrblade?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, Thundrblade is designed to skate just like a normal inline skate when you want to or when batteries are dead.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do you ship worldwide?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we will ship worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How much </strong><strong>is the shipping cost</strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>A: The shipping cost will be paid before we ship your Thundrblade, we didn't add it into our Indiegogo campaign just to make sure you don't pay more than you need, we will ship it with the lowest rate possible in April 2019 to your country.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is Thundrblade hard to learn?</strong></p>
<p>A: Thundrblade is easier to skate than a normal inline skate since it has regen brakes, and you don't need one-foot balance to push. We will have video tutorials on how to ride and skate with Thundrblade.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I grind with Thundrblade?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, Thundrblade is not meant for grinding.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I do tricks/jumps with Thundrblade?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, Thundrblade can withstand anything a normal Urban skate can. It can handle tricks and jumps</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I Thundrblade if it's rainy outside?</strong></p>
<p>A: Thundrblade components can withstand rain, but the motors and brakes will not work optimally when the pavement is wet. We advise the use of off-road tires and disengage of the motor for wet pavement skating.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens when I need spare batteries or parts later in the future?</strong></p>
<p>A: We will sell all the parts including the batteries on our website</p>
<p><strong>Q: If I break my remote controller will I be able to order a new one?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, we will offer replacement controllers on our website.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I test ride a Thundrblade?</strong></p>
<p>A: Unfortunately we have only one prototype available right now, so test riding is going to be difficult until we have the production version ready.</p>
<p><strong>Q:  What is the max weight limit for Thundrblade?</strong></p>
<p>A: The maximum weight limit is 120kg/270pounds</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does Thundrblade come in different sizes?</strong> </p>
<p>A: Thundrblade frame is only one size, but our complete setup has all shoe sizes from US 6/EU 38 to US10.5 EU 44. Refer to the sizing chart bellow. If you have feet bigger or smaller than this we suggest getting the Thundrblade Frame System option and looking for a skate boot from a different brand.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What is ""Regenerative Braking""?</strong></p>
<p>A: When you brake Thundrblade, it uses its motors to apply resistance to the wheels generating electricity in the process. This electricity is put into the batteries recharging them.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I recharge the batteries skating using the Regenerative Brakes?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, you could, but it would take a really long time. Regenerative brakes extend the total range of Thundrblade, especially in the case of a really long downhill where you control your speed using the regenerative brakes.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How long does it take to charge the battery?</strong></p>
<p>A: The Thundrblade battery pair charges fully in around 2 hours</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I order spare batteries/charger?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes. There's a perk for extra batteries, just add the value to your pledge.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT?</strong></p>

</div></div>","Thundrblade Electric Inline Skate
Let's Storm the Streets!


Thundrblade is a high quality carbon inline skate frame with a battery-powered motor inside. It has a wireless controller, swappable batteries and can be attached to your favorite inline skate boot. The frame fits two offroad wheels or LED wheels for evening fun. Thundrblade features a system of regenerative brakes that can be used even while skating without the motors on. Electric assist mode is in development as well. With it you can experience the thrill of speed without a drop of sweat as you carve through the streets.

Electric inline skates: the pros Thundrblade: the better powered option
Deciding between skates and other powered last mile solutions? You don’t have to give up your favorite mode of transport anymore! Safer, easier to learn and more maneuverable on crowded streets, Thundrblade surpasses powered boards. Feel more in control (and don’t send a powered bullet of a board crashing into people or cars if you fall). Ride electric or not, it’s your choice!
Thundrblade inline skate system is a hybrid - that means it will never leave you stranded without juice in the batteries. Ran out of spare batteries? Use it as normal skate! Switch between motors and your own power within seconds. Regen brakes naturally work in both cases. Batteries running low? Swap ‘em!
Rather than a heavy big battery we went for lighter, swappable ones, so your feet are always light enough for your tricks or commute. Swapping the battery doesn’t require tools and can be done on the go.

Two wheels for comfort
Drain covers, tactile tiles or historic pavement in the way? Don’t feel the uneven surfaces and cracks thanks to the 110 and 125 mm size of our wheels. Want to know more about Thundrblade technology? Read our FAQ!

What can I do with a pair of TBs?
Commute with Thundrblade
You can finally skate to work or school and not come in all sweaty! Thundrblade is a perfect last mile solution, especially paired with an open boot. No need to carry your work shoes extra, just wear them!

 

Why use Thundrblade:
With electric skates, crowded sidewalks are no longer a problem. Watch our video to see how easily you can change from sidewalk to streets with Thundrblade
Avoid traffic with ease! On Thundrblades, you can easily maintain a 25-30 km/h speed, which is quicker than a car in a rush hour in many cities anyway and faster than any bicyclist.
125 mm PU wheels can take drains and even those pesky tactile pavement tiles.
Never again worry about parking or traffic, just take your Thundrblades! It’s also better for the environment.
Be a professional on skates! Our Thundrblade Complete Setup comes with everything you need out-of-the-box. 
Power(ed) workout
Is skating your favorite exercise, but your more experienced friends left you behind on that weekend group ride again?
If you’re recuperating after an illness, or just getting into condition, ride in assist mode and have a lot more fun!
Why use Thundrblade:
Use the assist mode to warm up safely and then use your own power to skate.
Go offroad with ease. BMX trails, parks, rougher country trails are not a problem with offroad wheels.
Give your dog a workout too! Watch how Daniel e-skates with his dog.
 Let them try to catch you!

Explore!
If you love exploring new cities, it’s time for Thundrblade. Experience urban areas, parks or even countryside without your feet hurting after a long day of sightseeing! Watch how Daniel explored Tokyo, Osaka and even Aoi Matsuri festival in Kyoto.

Why use Thundrblade:
See more landmarks and sights in a day
Get a unique “feel” for the city
With motors on your feet you don’t feel the weight of your backpack
Take things off the road with our offroad wheels! Watch a video of a BMX trail ride.

Imagine how much you could see at a fair :) Get to know your city a lot better!
Tinkerer
Have you seen our motorized frames and immediately thought of ways to use them in your own skate rigs? Do you want them completely your way? By all means, start crafting!
Why use Thundrblade:
Try out many rigs! Our carbon frame is compatible with most skate boots on the market and two wheel sizes. Watch a wheel and boot change on the early prototypes(final design will change).

No need to compromise! Build what suits you. See what you can create with our motorized inline frames. Back the Thundrblade Frame System perk and receive a pair of frames, batteries, wheels all the tools necessary. We won’t even assemble them together for you!
ElecTricks
With Thundrblade, you can do a host of tricks! While not suitable for grinding, a lot of fun awaits you, especially with the LED wheels. What can I do with my Thundrblades?
Check out the LED wheel fun

Ever tried going 25mph fast in reverse?
Skated with only one Thundrblade?
Skate off-road

Have a lightsaber duel!

Jump obstacles and ramps with more speed.
 
Kill the boredom, have some fun and make awesome trick videos yourself with the Thundrblade Complete Setup perk - a set of blades, a Carbon Fiber freestyle boot, offroad and LED wheels. You can’t grind, but you can fly!
 
How it works
Thundrblade is a ""Frame System"" which means all the electronics, batteries and motors are inside the frame. You can use your preferred skate boot with Thundrblade or you can get our Complete Setup that comes with high-end carbon fiber skate boots so you can Thundrblade right out-of-the-box.
Compatible with UFS and SSM 165mm


Examples of boots

 
Push the Wireless Remote Controller stick forward to accelerate and pull it back to brake. The brake is especially useful on long descents since you can control your speed safely maintaining both feet on the ground and optimal body balance.


 
To go in reverse the same logic applies, pull backward. When in Reverse push forward to brake.

 
LED Wheels increase visibility and safety for night skating.

 
Thundrblade also comes with off-road tires.
 
 
You can skate normally or use the motors at any time. Our exclusive motor disengage system allows skating without any resistance when using human power just like a normal skate

 
Swap batteries on the fly for an unlimited range.

 
Uphills are officially fun! Thundrblade can go up inclines of up to 20% rate.

 
Thundrblade can handle jumps and urban skating. This makes easy to avoid obstacles such as curbs and oncoming traffic.

The system uses wheel speed differentiation to turn left and right, which means Moboster stays parallel to the ground at all times.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q. What’s wheel speed differentiation?</strong></p><p>A. The difference in individual wheel speed.  Moboster is powered by two motorized rear wheels, and when one wheel turns slower than the other, it creates drag and turns the vehicle.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q.

Why doesn’t Moboster have more range?</strong></p><p>A. We wanted to keep Moboster lightweight and portable, so we had to balance between range and weight.  Moboster uses the most advanced battery systems available with the highest power density, but unfortunately, the range is still limited by current battery technology.  Also, in our studies, most use case scenarios for small electric rideables won’t go over the 10 miles range.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q. Is the battery swappable?</strong></p><p>A. Currently no.  Swappable batteries require more moving parts and separable connectors, which can become highly unreliable due to vibration.  In order to eliminate vibration, it would mean more parts to secure the batteries and thus making Moboster heavier.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q. How did you keep the price low?</strong></p><p>A. Our engineers are all seasoned professionals who are highly experienced with sourcing and manufacturing.  Our headquarter is located in Taiwan, where a lot of the high-end electronics are manufactured.  Being close to our supply chain also cuts a lot of the cost down.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Q.

Our engineers are all seasoned professionals who are highly experienced with sourcing and manufacturing.  Our headquarter is located in Taiwan, where a lot of the high-end electronics are manufactured.  Being close to our supply chain also cuts a lot of the cost down. Q. How can you guarantee that Moboster will be delivered?A. All our engineers have worked on products that went into mass production, and Moboster won’t be an exception. Q. Did Moboser’s lead engineer really worked for NASA?A. Yes he did. Q. When will the attachments and hardware upgrades be available?A. We have many of them planned, and once we have our initial funding, we’ll get designing right away.  This is also why this campaign is so important to us, it speeds up the creation of all the neat things that can be added to the Moboster. Q. Why aren’t there any stretch goals?A. We want to be focused on making the best product possible within the timeline we have set, stretch goals would bring a lot of uncertainties to that.  So for now, no stretch goals are planned.  But, that’s not set in stone. Q. How will I keep the firmware updated?  Will there be a phone app?A. Yes, a phone app is in the plan, and we’ll reveal the app as soon as it’s ready for the public.  The app will be able to update Moboster’s firmware, along with other fun tweaks, either through WiFi or Bluetooth.  We also have an extra secret sauce called Particle Electron, and will reveal more on that later on as well.",35.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Uber has been one of the biggest enablers of free-market capitalism in the last decade, allowing persons with just the use of their car and smartphone, to successfully launch their own business, work their own hours, earn a decent wage, and take charge of their lives. As Ethiopia continues to strive for economic development and the betterment of its people, we look to create similar opportunities within our country. My name is Habtamu Tadesse, founder of ZayRide, and I am currently on the fast track to transforming the taxi hailing sector in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Since its launch in our capital city of Addis Ababa, ZayRide has already gained over 15,000 registered users, and completed over 1000 rides. Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with persons spending less times waiting for taxis, no longer needing to walk long distances to main roads just to get a ride. Safety is one of our biggest concerns, and drivers go through extensive background checks, so we know who they are, where they are, and what they look like. The ZayRide app itself has been built to function on slower internet speeds, so it has the potential to be applied anywhere in Africa, with minimalized features and low resolution images.</p>
<p>Although we have managed to grow the business to it’s current level of success, I believe that ZayRide, that began with nothing more than my own personal savings, has the potential to go much further. That is why I have begun this campaign, in the hopes of raising US$100,000.</p>
<p>With the funds raised, I am hoping to hire a software engineer and developer to further improve upon the existing app interface. I am also in the process of trying to set up a ZayRide call center, that would not only provide much needed jobs, but allow persons without smart phones to call and request our service. In an effort to help spread the love, we would also like to implement a training course, that would teach local drivers to speak basic English – a necessary skill in the third largest international diplomatic community in the world.</p>
<p>To those who donate, thank you for your contribution, and I hope that you will continue to follow ZayRide’s progress in the coming year. Even if you are unable to donate at this time, sharing this campaign with family and friends would go a long way in helping to spread the word. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to send a message. Ethiopia has one of the fastest growing economies in the world, let us help it grow a little faster.</p>

<p><b>GLEAMFIRE is a high-efficiency car washing system.</b> Its patent pending design filters your wash water, providing a superior clean while requiring less water and less effort than using a bucket.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1385707/files/20150415103119-Panel_Before_After.jpg?1429119079"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">
<b style=""font-weight: bold; background-color: initial;"">GLEAMFIRE cleans better </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">than conventional wash methods by filtering out dirt. If you really care about your car's finish, you wash it by hand. Until now, that's meant using a bucket—but the bucket has a fatal flaw: the dirt you take off your car accumulates in the bucket, where it sloshes right back onto your wash mitt. After a while you might as well wash your car with sandpaper.</span>

<div style=""text-align: left;"">By filtering the water, GLEAMFIRE removes abrasive particles. That means the grit you take off your car <b>stays</b> off. No more rubbing it into the finish. No more changing out bucket water halfway through a wash.</div>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><br/></div>

</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Those filters also mean <b>GLEAMFIRE saves water</b>. It only takes 1.5 gallons to clean a car. That's a 50-85% reduction compared to a bucket wash. We all know water is a precious resource, whether we live under water restrictions or not. When you use less water, you also use less soap, which means less runoff and less waste. That's easier on the planet and easier on your wallet.</div>

</div></div>","GLEAMFIRE is a high-efficiency car washing system. Its patent pending design filters your wash water, providing a superior clean while requiring less water and less effort than using a bucket.



GLEAMFIRE cleans better than conventional wash methods by filtering out dirt. If you really care about your car's finish, you wash it by hand. Until now, that's meant using a bucket—but the bucket has a fatal flaw: the dirt you take off your car accumulates in the bucket, where it sloshes right back onto your wash mitt. After a while you might as well wash your car with sandpaper.



By filtering the water, GLEAMFIRE removes abrasive particles. That means the grit you take off your car stays off. No more rubbing it into the finish. No more changing out bucket water halfway through a wash.






Those filters also mean GLEAMFIRE saves water. It only takes 1.5 gallons to clean a car. That's a 50-85% reduction compared to a bucket wash. We all know water is a precious resource, whether we live under water restrictions or not. When you use less water, you also use less soap, which means less runoff and less waste. That's easier on the planet and easier on your wallet.


We support the Water Use it Wisely initiative.






GLEAMFIRE is easy to use. No squatting or kneeling required. The handle locks so you can carry it around, and since it uses less water it's a lot lighter than a bucket. Once you load the wash mitt into the unit, you have everything in one tidy, self-contained package, making it easy to move from one area of your car to another. No more long walks to the bucket, no more slopping water all over the place, no more bending and kneeling. Just a fast, efficient wash. 








Wash your way with GLEAMFIRE. Whether your car is in the garage, on the street, in the driveway, or on blocks in a cornfield, GLEAMFIRE can wash it there. Have a favorite wash soap? You can use it (you just won't need as much, because you're saving water). No hose? No problem. Just use a no-rinse soap and a microfiber towel (we include them with the system, along with a nice fresh wash mitt).

  ""A 1.5 Gallon Car Wash?"" April 24, 2015


 Podcast Interview - April 28, 2015


Can't believe it until you see it for yourself? Here's a 15-minute demo video.









It all started because of founder John Lohavichan's love of keeping his car shiny. Ever since high school, John has washed and waxed his cars by hand.

When John moved to New England, winter car washing presented a problem. 

A hose was out of the question as his garage had no drain, and it was below freezing outside. Using a bucket meant freezing hands, a wet floor and, very dirty wash water. He knew there had to be a better way.

One day, John was pondering this problem as he fed the fish in his aquarium.
And then inspiration struck!
The water in the fish tank stays clean because it circulates through filters. If he used a similar approach with car wash water, he reasoned, it would be possible to clean better while using a lot less water.

The next day he began experimenting with a discarded soda bottle and Gleamfire was born.



But it didn't stop there. Over one and a half years, 13 different prototypes were built. We also collaborated with three design firms to refine our vision.

Today, GLEAMFIRE's patent pending design has come a long way from the soda bottle:








By pre-ordering a Gleamfire, you will help bring high-efficiency car washing to life. The funds raised will be used for tooling so that we can start manufacturing. 








VISION
John Lohavichan is the Founder of Gleamfire. He wanted to figure out a new way to wash his car in his garage during the winter. Thinking about this problem while feeding his fish gave the spark to try filtering car wash water and Gleamfire was born. He’s an MBA from Vanderbilt University and has 20 years of experience as a Product Manager building software products for startups and financial firms.

We are helping student athletes by reducing brain injuries and concussions caused by helmet to helmet contact.Independent tests have shown that the unique drag-reducing capabilities of KLY-MAX Super Sealant on football helmets allows glancing blows rather than blunt force helmet to helmet contact.  It reduces the chance of concussion or brain injury. Note: A portion of every sale will go towards reducing the incidence of athletic brain injury.“We have been using the product for 3 months and the the results have been truly amazing!""  L. Boese also stated, ""KLY-MAX Super Sealant has worked so well on our football helmets, that I have just begun applying it to all our lacrosse helmets and soon to be applied to batting helmets for both our men's and women's programs.”L. Boese, Santa Ana CAAthletic Equipment Inventory Manager We are asking for supporters to help us raise funds and be the first to receive this breakthrough product and help us introduce KLY-MAX Super Sealant to the world.  Anti-Drag Technologies, LLC has removed any risk of participating in the funding of our project, as we are proud to say that we are debt free and in full production as a solely owned company.The challenge we face as a small independent company is getting our message out. We believe the power of the people is our solution.  We are raising funds to run a digital and social media marketing campaign.  Your contribution will be used to drive awareness through social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and other marketing medias.  Indiegogo allows small companies like us with breakthrough products to display their technology and create awareness about its benefits.  Join us in introducing the award winning KLY-MAX Super Sealant to the world.KLY-MAX Super Sealant!

Customers will be updated via email and social/blog updates along the way.</p><p><strong>Q: Will you the bike arrive as described?</strong></p><p>Everything we’ve advertised is confirmed. Probably we are going to give some extra cm to the saddle, and use a memory foam inside the saddle.</p><p><strong>Q: Why did you launch first on Kickstarter and then IndieGoGo? </strong></p><p>Well, we realised IndieGoGo has a more inherent audience for our product and we can extend the campaign after the new EU regulations, so we needed to reach and get a brand new strategy to see our Magma around the world. </p><p><strong>Q: Why is Magma cheaper now than the first launch? </strong></p><p> We had numerous meetings with our suppliers, explaining our plans and visions. They agreed to cut their margins to see the project starts. We have their support because they love the product and visions. The price is safe to guarantee to be safe in business and offer the lowest price possible. </p><p><strong>Q: Does Magma come in different sizes? </strong></p><p>No. Magma is built in one frame size to fit a variety of riders 5'2"" (160cm) and above (Vincenzo is 6'6"" 198cm). Sitting in different positions on the saddle will allow for a comfortable upright riding position and plenty of room to move around to find your comfort.</p><p><strong>Q: What colours does it come in?</strong></p><p>Signature Grey, Matte Black, Magma Red and Ferrari Yellow. </p><p><strong>Q: What is called the shipyard where you are manufacturing the frames?</strong></p><p>Tec Service Italia S.r.l. <a href=""http://www.tsiweb.eu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.tsiweb.eu/</a>  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltBR0jpab-Q"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltBR0jpab-Q</a></p><p><strong>Q: Can I use Magma in rain and mud?</strong></p><p>Yes, all our connectors are completely waterproof and protected, <strong>Fenders and rack</strong> will be added as accessories once the campaign will finish and you can add them with 20% off on the retail price. </p><p><strong>Q: Is Magma single speed? How can I handle different ride scenarios? </strong></p><p>Yes, 24T/55T and our in-built motor torque sensor will just give you the right amount of power you need.  </p><p>A torque sensor is a constant effort bike (the speed will vary if your effort changes).</p><p>Now the benefits of the torque sensor bike are:</p><ul>
<li>it will use less battery power and your range will be longer</li>
<li>It feels more naturally like a bike – you control the speed through your pedals, the more you push the faster you go. So for example at the traffic light the sensor will compensate your effort giving you the right amount of power to take the bike rolling, you don’t have to fiddle with the controls much, you will feel like flying! </li>
</ul><p><strong>Q: How much weight can Magma handle? </strong></p><p>Magma looks really thin and fragile but is built with Italian chromoly 25crMo4 Tensile strength RM: 750-1000N/mm2 which is durable, high quality and light. Sourced in Milan and coated with naval technologies, the frames will be practically untouchable by the elements, making it last forever, it can handle riders up to  130kg.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I put a friend on the back?</strong></p><p>Yes, you can but ride carefully at your own risk. Max ‘total’ rider weight is rated at 130kg.</p><p><strong>Q: What’s the top speed?</strong></p><p>The Magma EU can reach a top speed of 16 mph (25 km/h) in street-legal using pedal-assist, with throttle power up to 6 mph. Magma + in off-road, pedal-assist power continues through to 55km/h mph.</p><p><strong>Q: Is it street legal?</strong></p><p>Magma 250W EU is totally legal in Europe. Magma + is not legal on public roads.  You will need to refer to your local laws for specifics.</p><p><strong>Q: Do I need a license to ride Magma?</strong></p><p>No. You will need to refer to your local laws for full details. It is possible to limit top speed with minor programming details which we make readily available on our website.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I ride the bike without the motor?</strong></p><p>Yes, you can pedal Magma just like any other bike.</p><p><strong>Q: How fast can I go with just the throttle?</strong></p><p>Magma's throttle will provide continuous power to the motor up to 6 mph on EU version (set it on the display)</p><p><strong>Q: How much does Magma weigh?</strong></p><p>It weighs approximately 22kg, however we are continuously working with our engineers to drop  the weight, complete with battery and all parts. </p><p><strong>Q: How long does Magma battery last? How far can I go?</strong></p><p>The battery inside Magma and Magma +  are built to last up to 60 miles (80km)  with the pedal assist - depending on rider weight, terrain, and other factors. </p><p><strong>Q: Can I lock the battery? Is the battery removable?</strong></p><p>Our batteries are protected by a locking mechanism and securely located in the down tube. You can remove it and take it home or charge on the bike.</p><p><strong>Q: How long does it take for the battery to charge?</strong></p><p>From fully depleted to fully charged, the battery takes around 5-6 hours to charge with the stock 2A charger. Using any other chargers besides the provided charger (or Quick Charger) will void the warranty.</p><p><strong>Q: How do I charge the battery?</strong></p><p>You can either charge the battery while it is on the bike or take the battery off the bike and charge it using any normal household outlet.</p><p><strong>Q: Does the bike come with a charger?</strong></p><p>Yes.  The bikes ship with our standard 2A charger.</p><p><strong> Q: Does pedaling or breaking Magma charge the battery?</strong></p><p> No.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I ride Magma on the sand or snow?</strong></p><p>Sure you can but make sure you do a detail cleaning afterwards so you don’t wreck your drive train. That’s not under warranty.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I choose different tires?</strong></p><p>Sure we are going to give you the opportunity to swap to the Vee Rubber <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532585343/ctweitbbjd4wqci8cbbo.jpg"" src=""""/> </p><p><strong>Q: Do you ship outside the EU?</strong></p><p>Yes</p><p><strong>Q: What assembly is required?</strong></p><p>Install the quick-release front wheel, install the pedals, tighten the stem and you’re ready to go.</p><p><strong>Q: How is Magma delivered and is it easy to assemble?</strong></p><p>Magma comes delivered with instructions and requires minimal assembly. If you don't have much experience with bikes, we recommend that you visit your local bike shop to ensure your safety.</p><p><strong>Q: How much does shipping cost?</strong></p><p>Shipping is FREE by UPS Included in the cost of the bike in EU states. </p><p><strong>Q: What kind of warranty do you offer?</strong>  </p><p>- 1 Year coverage on electrical components</p><p>- 2 Year coverage on mechanical components</p><p>- Lifetime coverage on frame</p><p>We do not offer warranty on parts such as tires, disc brakes, and belt due to normal wear. </p><p><strong>Q: What kind of accessories do you currently have or can I expect in the near future?</strong></p><p>We are regularly working to develop more accessories and options based on demand. Please let's discuss about it, <strong>we are developing  side bags, racks, net...</strong></p><p><strong>Q: What about spare parts? Can any bike shop assist me?</strong></p><p>Magma battery is custom made and available to buy from us, the same about the frameset  which is hand made in our Italian Factory. The rest of the components are standard, meaning that you can upgrade your bike as you desire with other parts.</p><p><strong>Q: Who is responsible for any additional taxes?</strong></p><p>The backer is responsible for tax. Within EU states <strong>no hidden prices. No additional Tax.</strong> </p><p><strong>Q: Can I test ride a Magma ?</strong></p><p>Test rides are currently only available at our office in Glasgow UK and Pozzallo Italy .

How can I handle different ride scenarios? Yes, 24T/55T and our in-built motor torque sensor will just give you the right amount of power you need.  A torque sensor is a constant effort bike (the speed will vary if your effort changes).Now the benefits of the torque sensor bike are:
it will use less battery power and your range will be longer
It feels more naturally like a bike – you control the speed through your pedals, the more you push the faster you go. So for example at the traffic light the sensor will compensate your effort giving you the right amount of power to take the bike rolling, you don’t have to fiddle with the controls much, you will feel like flying! 
Q: How much weight can Magma handle? Magma looks really thin and fragile but is built with Italian chromoly 25crMo4 Tensile strength RM: 750-1000N/mm2 which is durable, high quality and light. Sourced in Milan and coated with naval technologies, the frames will be practically untouchable by the elements, making it last forever, it can handle riders up to  130kg.Q: Can I put a friend on the back?Yes, you can but ride carefully at your own risk. Max ‘total’ rider weight is rated at 130kg.Q: What’s the top speed?The Magma EU can reach a top speed of 16 mph (25 km/h) in street-legal using pedal-assist, with throttle power up to 6 mph. Magma + in off-road, pedal-assist power continues through to 55km/h mph.Q: Is it street legal?Magma 250W EU is totally legal in Europe. Magma + is not legal on public roads.  You will need to refer to your local laws for specifics.Q: Do I need a license to ride Magma?No. You will need to refer to your local laws for full details. It is possible to limit top speed with minor programming details which we make readily available on our website.Q: Can I ride the bike without the motor?Yes, you can pedal Magma just like any other bike.Q: How fast can I go with just the throttle?Magma's throttle will provide continuous power to the motor up to 6 mph on EU version (set it on the display)Q: How much does Magma weigh?It weighs approximately 22kg, however we are continuously working with our engineers to drop  the weight, complete with battery and all parts. Q: How long does Magma battery last? How far can I go?The battery inside Magma and Magma +  are built to last up to 60 miles (80km)  with the pedal assist - depending on rider weight, terrain, and other factors. Q: Can I lock the battery? Is the battery removable?Our batteries are protected by a locking mechanism and securely located in the down tube. You can remove it and take it home or charge on the bike.Q: How long does it take for the battery to charge?From fully depleted to fully charged, the battery takes around 5-6 hours to charge with the stock 2A charger. Using any other chargers besides the provided charger (or Quick Charger) will void the warranty.Q: How do I charge the battery?You can either charge the battery while it is on the bike or take the battery off the bike and charge it using any normal household outlet.Q: Does the bike come with a charger?Yes.  The bikes ship with our standard 2A charger. Q: Does pedaling or breaking Magma charge the battery? No.Q: Can I ride Magma on the sand or snow?Sure you can but make sure you do a detail cleaning afterwards so you don’t wreck your drive train. That’s not under warranty.Q: Can I choose different tires?Sure we are going to give you the opportunity to swap to the Vee Rubber  Q: Do you ship outside the EU?YesQ: What assembly is required?Install the quick-release front wheel, install the pedals, tighten the stem and you’re ready to go.Q: How is Magma delivered and is it easy to assemble?Magma comes delivered with instructions and requires minimal assembly. If you don't have much experience with bikes, we recommend that you visit your local bike shop to ensure your safety.Q: How much does shipping cost?Shipping is FREE by UPS Included in the cost of the bike in EU states. Q: What kind of warranty do you offer?  - 1 Year coverage on electrical components- 2 Year coverage on mechanical components- Lifetime coverage on frameWe do not offer warranty on parts such as tires, disc brakes, and belt due to normal wear. Q: What kind of accessories do you currently have or can I expect in the near future?We are regularly working to develop more accessories and options based on demand. Please let's discuss about it, we are developing  side bags, racks, net...Q: What about spare parts? Can any bike shop assist me?Magma battery is custom made and available to buy from us, the same about the frameset  which is hand made in our Italian Factory. The rest of the components are standard, meaning that you can upgrade your bike as you desire with other parts.Q: Who is responsible for any additional taxes?The backer is responsible for tax. Within EU states no hidden prices. No additional Tax. Q: Can I test ride a Magma ?Test rides are currently only available at our office in Glasgow UK and Pozzallo Italy . Please contact us to schedule an appointment.Q: Can I get a refund?Please refer to Indiegogo's refund policy. Learn MoreTransparency starts hereWe will be using only Italian chromoly 25crMo4 Tensile strength RM: 750-1000N/mm2 which is durable, high quality and light. Sourced in Milan and coated with naval technologies, the frames will be practically untouchable by the elements, making it last forever.We work with China and Taiwan daily, this allows us to build the bicycles to our specifications and offer more affordable, and simple products. When we build Magma in Italy it’s something different for the emotions, we can feel the final goal and the people and their stories involved, which we will introduce with your pledge.As with all overseas trades and suppliers, unforeseen complications can pop up, we will always try our best to mitigate them. The project is ambitious, we will have the support from Shanghai and our factory manager to complete on time and to the specifications, we can use trusted on market components without complicating the manufacturing process and deliver on time. They have more than 15 years experience in bike building and they are happy to be part of our project. Our mechanics in U.K. will be trained on the specific components and the quality check will be followed closely to assure the perfect process by Lorenzo. Every bike will be CE certificated, not just printed on the box,  every welding certificated, every part you are buying will be traceable from day1. Transparency and engagement in the process are our first priority.The framesets once finished and coated in Sicily will be shipped to U.K. by sea where the assembling process will be finalised, being in Europe this means we will have It in the U.K quickly. We prefer to ship our final products from U.K. from our first campaign we know it’s reliable and already assured by our existing contract with UPS.The motor and all the components will be shipped from MAC Motor (and Samsung for battery cells), I'm in touch with one of the cofounders and they are happy to cooperate with this project, they invited us to Interbike International Expo in USA on next September, they are leaders in the electric bike motors and we are proud to use their products.The belt drives system will be shipped from Germany, where I’m daily in contact with Chris and Frank from Gates (Bosh' Sister), they assisted us from day 1, supporting last year with our Crono and again a streamlined process as they are within Europe .We are forecasting with safe margins the supply capacity, we can be sure to supply 300 frames within a month using one single dims, if the demands are bigger we can double it easily using 2 dims and 2 productions lines.From our first campaign we learned that for customers outside the EU it would have been really efficient to ship a container, shipping a container it means we can add spare parts for the after sales assistance.For EU customers forget any issues, this is an EU product so it will be extremely easy to manage.Our plan is to place a local Hub per country which has more than 100 backers.For a hub we’d be able to guarantee a local storage for parts and replacements, making it even easier for our customers. This is something we learned from our previous campaign.We are proud to start this project firstly for the social impact, the shipyard in low working demand, so providing work to 30 employees converting part of the structure to a modern business model. And bring on the market a unique product to feel proud to use everyday knowing the story you are supporting.Summing up:Italy(MAGMA frameset)-Scotland(assembling and storing)-China (motor and batteries)- Germany (belt and sprockets)Deliveries will be managed directly with UPS and FREE on bikes within EU.To non EU customers obviously there will be import and VAT fees to be paid, we want to be transparent on it too.We prefer to be clear now and not disappoint anyone.We just want to make sure you will have the best products and get Involved in our project as parts of it. Once the production starts in Sicily, we want to plan an open day for you backers in Sicily , visiting our facilities and one of the best place in Italy for food and holidays.",26.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Best things come in two. For that reason we have brought two different Juanas, very similar, but at the same time very different.</p>
<p>Don't get fouled by the appearances as at first glance they seem identical. We are glad to present: <strong>Juana La Cubana and Juana la Loca.</strong></p>
<p>The major difference between them is the <strong>power</strong>. Juana La Cubana has a 250w36v Bafang motor and a 36v13.6ah samsung battery with a maximum speed of 25km/h. On the other hand, Juana La Loca has a 750w48v Bafang motor and a 48v17.5ah samsung battery with a maximum speed of 45km/h.</p>
<p>But there's more. <strong>Juana La Loca comes equipped with a big badass motorcycle front light and a thumb throttle.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Juana la Cubana </strong>is fully compliant with the EU regulation. Juana la Cubana falls into the ""pedaled"" category, which means you can ride it like any normal bike, on public and private streets and without any license, license plate or vehicle registration</p>
<p>Even though <strong>Juana la Loca </strong>can be legally sold in the EU, it can not be ridden on public streets without doing a prior vehicle registration with your local traffic administration. It is considered a ""motor cycle"" and therefore needs a license and an assurance. Juana is not responsible for doing vehicle registrations and use the clients does.</p>
<p>You can check all the specs in the next table:</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>We recommend European riders to select Juana la Cubana (250w) since you will be able to ride it anywhere without the need of a license, license plate or vehicle registration.</strong></p>

Even though Juana la Loca can be legally sold in the EU, it can not be ridden on public streets without doing a prior vehicle registration with your local traffic administration. It is considered a ""motor cycle"" and therefore needs a license and an assurance. Juana is not responsible for doing vehicle registrations and use the clients does.
You can check all the specs in the next table:

We recommend European riders to select Juana la Cubana (250w) since you will be able to ride it anywhere without the need of a license, license plate or vehicle registration.
 

 
 

 

We are Alex and Pablo, two best friends from Spain. We both share a passion for bicycles, design and sustainability. Our vision was to create cool, unique and powerful e-bikes that are not only extremely fun to ride but also would drop jaws along its way.

We are hungry and knowledgeable - Pablo has extensive experience in the mobility industry and Alex in manufacturing and logistics. We also share entrepreneurial skills and business development talents. This unique mix , brings out the best of both to ensure an enormous success.
 
 

 
Even though Juana is already incredible as it comes, we understand if you want additional add-ons to make your Juana as unique as possible and to fit it to your needs.

 

 

 
We don't like to over complicate things.
 
We are dreamers, but we also keep our feet on the ground. That is why our goal is to raise 20.000€. This amount will be enough for us to start producing the first Juanas and spread the word.
If you back our project for a Juana, get ready to be treated like you deserve – early backers will have the unique opportunity to fully customize their own Juana. 
If we don't reach the goal, we will continue to work and listen to your feedback. Money will be refunded and we promise to come back stronger than ever. We won't stop working, we want to be the best.
We won't lie, this will not be an easy journey, but we are dreamers, we are fighters, we are hard workers and we will never stop reinventing ourselves. E-bike regulation is strict and has many limitations. Moreover, import and export barriers are difficult to overcome. 
While we will find more hurdles on the way, we are not afraid. We see problems as challenges and we love them. We never said this would be easy but impossible does not exist in our dictionary.

 

 
We want to lead the future of mobility by taking care of our planet, but we cannot do it alone.
Don´t worry if you cannot make a contribution - spreading the word is one of the best ways you can help. Indiegogo’s sharing functionalities are great, but any other way you can spread our work will be greatly appreciated. Mention us on Twitter, share the Juana on your Instagram story (https://www.instagram.com/juanacletas/), or post our bikes on your Facebook feed.

<p>To accomplish this goal, we have developed the Locke-T Sensors. These devices are attached to one screw in each wheel in the car.

<p>In every technology development there are several challenges. In the Locke-T development the first one was to design a PCB as tiny as a watch battery that could fit in the screw head and the rim, and we made it possible. Then the next challenge was to make a beautiful but simple design for the Sensor capable to operate under extreme climate and the heat of the screw when you hit the road, and we got it. The next challenges are the correct code writing and the Alfa and Beta testing of the PCB's but we are getting the job done.</p>

We do know how to develop technology devices and how to manufacture, but we need your help to spread the word so we can keep going on the development and launch our first production.
We will be asking some of our first contributors to be a part of our BTP (Beta Testing Program) where they will get a Locke-T Beta version to test it and give us some feedback to  get it perfect.


Where we are in the development




We have finished the prototype of the Locke-T Sensors plastic case and we are developing the first set of electronics prototypes of these and the Locke-T master. We are in the stage of writing the code for the wireless communication protocol between the Locke-T Sensors, Master and Smartphones. The next stage is Testing the electronic prototypes with the code and the App and make the first Debug.

Development Timeline
June / July 2015.-  App, Master and Sensor Code writing
August 2015.-  Alfa PCB testing and corrections 
September 2015.-  Beta PCB testing 
October 2015.- Alfa plastic case testing and corrections (if any)
November / December 2015.- Beta plastic case testing and Beta testing with contributors.
January 2016.- Public Release

What you get with your order of Locke-T

Each Locke-T System Comes with the following:


1 Master
4 Screw Sensors (with CR2032 batteries included)
Power and signal wires
Free LOCKE-T App to be downloaded from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store 


Challenges

In every technology development there are several challenges. In the Locke-T development the first one was to design a PCB as tiny as a watch battery that could fit in the screw head and the rim, and we made it possible. Then the next challenge was to make a beautiful but simple design for the Sensor capable to operate under extreme climate and the heat of the screw when you hit the road, and we got it. The next challenges are the correct code writing and the Alfa and Beta testing of the PCB's but we are getting the job done.

Technical Details 


The Sensor measures are 23x30 mm like shown in the image above. This makes it fit perfectly in the rim and it is available for the 2 most common measures of screws: 17mm and 3/4"".




IMPORTANT: PLEASE SELECT THE CORRECT MEASURE OF YOUR SCREWS (17mm OR 3/4"").


Operational Temperature Range: -40 to 85ºC
Locke-T Sensor Battery Life: up to 1 year (at 25°C rated temperature)
Wireless communication: Bluetooth 4.0
Locke-T Master Power Source: 12-24 VDC (car's battery). 
Locke-T Sensor battery: CR2032 (common watch battery)
Detection mode: 2 laminated pins working as a push button (if making contact with the screw, the sensor is active and detecting. If is not making contact with the screw, the sensor is active but not detecting the screw). 


Extra Sensor for your spare tire?



If you have your Spare Tire exposed in the back of your car, you can get One Extra Sensor and Add it to your Locke-T System. Each System can monitor and communicate with up to 5 Sensors.

FAQs:

<p>The
 idea of the Leafxpro became real when we decided that riding our 
bicycles on sunny days just wasn't enough. We questioned ourselves why 
people tend to use limiting transportions when they can have the freedom
 of just picking up their bikes and ride as they please without the 
stress of car congestions, schedules or overcrowded buses and trains! So we started
 thinking that there had to be an efficient, durable, versatile, 
comfortable, stylish, ergonomic and easy to use way to ride from A to B,
 even with bad weather conditions.<br/>
</p>
<p>During the last
 two years we researched, designed and tested the best materials and structures so we 
could create the easiest and safest bicycles umbrella: the Leafxpro!</p>
<p>We
 need your help to speed up the manufacturing process so we can deliver 
to the promise of becoming a sustainable mobility product and improve peoples lives.</p>
<p>Thanks for your support!</p>

<p>The Leafxpro kit is modular so that the user can adjust the degree of protection depending on all kind of weather conditions.<br/><br/>There are two accessories that can be attach to the Leafxpro: the Storm Accessory and the Baby Accessory.</p>
<p>The Storm Accessory provides rear 
and side protection to the rider, and the two side panels can be 
detached through a couple of zippers.<br/><br/>The Baby Accessory provides
 protection to children transported in their baby seats. This accessory 
can also be combined with the Storm Accessory to provide safety to both,
 the rider and the child.</p>

<p>After placing the permanent fasteners on the bike, the Leafxpro is 
very easy to assemble or disassemble without the need of special tools.</p>
<p>This mounting process is simple and fast (about 1 minute) with just a few steps:<br/><br/>- The structure is removed from the bag and expanded;<br/><br/>- The structure is secured by fasteners to the bike;<br/><br/>- The structure is tensioned</p>

<p>To create a protective material that is light, functional, easy to use and secure,<br/>our engineers had to take inspiration from mother nature.<br/>The
 main goal was to create a product with a high performance form factor 
and at the same time it needed to be resistant enough to withstand winds
 up to 50mph (80km/h) so it wouldn't gain the umbrella effect.<br/><br/>We
 submitted the Leafxpro to a lot of tests so we could find out the true 
resistance of the entire structure and the most impressive one is shown 
below where the entire structure of the Leafxpro supports the weight of 
the bicycle without any dificulty! Truely impressive!</p>

<p>Aerodynamics was a critical in the development process of the 
structure. It was essential because through it cyclists can easily 
overcome the resistance of air, even when there are very strong 
headwinds!</p>

<p>The wedge-shaped form factor of the front, combined with all 
aerodynamic flow channels on the side and rear, provide a smooth ride.</p>

</div>","The
 idea of the Leafxpro became real when we decided that riding our 
bicycles on sunny days just wasn't enough. We questioned ourselves why 
people tend to use limiting transportions when they can have the freedom
 of just picking up their bikes and ride as they please without the 
stress of car congestions, schedules or overcrowded buses and trains! So we started
 thinking that there had to be an efficient, durable, versatile, 
comfortable, stylish, ergonomic and easy to use way to ride from A to B,
 even with bad weather conditions.

During the last
 two years we researched, designed and tested the best materials and structures so we 
could create the easiest and safest bicycles umbrella: the Leafxpro!
We
 need your help to speed up the manufacturing process so we can deliver 
to the promise of becoming a sustainable mobility product and improve peoples lives.
Thanks for your support!



                   








The Leafxpro kit is modular so that the user can adjust the degree of protection depending on all kind of weather conditions.There are two accessories that can be attach to the Leafxpro: the Storm Accessory and the Baby Accessory.
The Storm Accessory provides rear 
and side protection to the rider, and the two side panels can be 
detached through a couple of zippers.The Baby Accessory provides
 protection to children transported in their baby seats. This accessory 
can also be combined with the Storm Accessory to provide safety to both,
 the rider and the child.


STORM ACCESSORY











BABY ACCESSORY

















After placing the permanent fasteners on the bike, the Leafxpro is 
very easy to assemble or disassemble without the need of special tools.
This mounting process is simple and fast (about 1 minute) with just a few steps:- The structure is removed from the bag and expanded;- The structure is secured by fasteners to the bike;- The structure is tensioned


The Leafxpro and it's accessories are highly adjustable to the height of
 the user,  optimizing therefore the aerodynamics of the product and the
 comfort for the user. 

                  



To create a protective material that is light, functional, easy to use and secure,our engineers had to take inspiration from mother nature.The
 main goal was to create a product with a high performance form factor 
and at the same time it needed to be resistant enough to withstand winds
 up to 50mph (80km/h) so it wouldn't gain the umbrella effect.We
 submitted the Leafxpro to a lot of tests so we could find out the true 
resistance of the entire structure and the most impressive one is shown 
below where the entire structure of the Leafxpro supports the weight of 
the bicycle without any dificulty! Truely impressive!


RESISTANCE TEST





Aerodynamics was a critical in the development process of the 
structure. It was essential because through it cyclists can easily 
overcome the resistance of air, even when there are very strong 
headwinds!


The wedge-shaped form factor of the front, combined with all 
aerodynamic flow channels on the side and rear, provide a smooth ride.






The Leafxpro and it's accessories are highly compatible with almost any city bike! 




Your bicycle may have a handlebar with different formfactors (straight, 
curved or U-shaped). The only requirement is it must have a width 
between 48cm and 65cm.
















































The Leafxpro is lightweight, compact 
and easy to transport. It accommodates quite easily anywhere and it can 
also be carried on the bike or on the back of the cyclist in a simple 
and quick way.

<h3><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Q:  How much weight can SMARTIE handle?</strong></i></p>
<p>A: SMARTIE can handle up to 240lbs / 109kg</p>
<p><i><strong>Q:  What size rider does this fit?</strong></i></p>
<p>A: <strong> </strong>SMARTIE is designed to fit riders from 5'0 to 6'2""</p>
<p><i><strong>Q:  How much does SMARTIE weigh?</strong></i></p>
<p>A: SMARTIE weighs 13.6 kg (30lbs) without battery &amp; 16 kg (35lbs) w/ battery</p>
<p><i><strong>Q: Can the battery be removed?</strong></i></p>
<p>A: Yes, the battery has a lock and it can be removed</p>
<p><i><strong>Q: How is SMARTIE delivered and is it easy to assemble?</strong></i></p>
<p>A:  SMARTIE is shipped 100% fully assembled. However, you may want to have it tuned up and checked out at your local bike store once you receive it.</p>
<p><i><strong>Q: Can I still bike SMARTIE if the battery runs out of power?</strong></i></p>
<p>A: Yes of course! If the battery runs out of power you can still ride SMARTIE the same as you would a regular bicycle.</p>
<p><i><strong>Q: How far can I ride on battery power?</strong></i></p>
<p>A: SMARTIE comes with a 9ah LG lithium ion battery. You can go up to 35  miles on a single charge.</p>
<p><i><strong>Q: Can I charge the battery by pedaling?</strong></i></p>
<p>A: No. Regenerative braking require a Direct Drive Motor which is heavy and not typically used in ebikes. They don’t offer a freewheeling mechanism that insulates the rider from the motor. That’s fine when your battery is charged but once your battery runs out of juice it means that when you pedal, not only do need to move yourself and the bike, but you also need to push against the resistance of the heavy motor. That can make for some very tired legs!</p>
<p><i><strong>Q: What kind of warranty do you offer?  </strong></i></p>

Why Did We Develop SMARTIE?
We believe that more people should get outside and be active! SMARTIE is a high tech & fun way of getting to work or around town that doesn't require the use of your car. It's great for getting exercise and it helps cuts down on car pollution. Plus, did we mention...It's Fun!

We knew that the SMARTIE had to be safe. That why we loaded it with safety features!
 
Bright, Integrated Headlight
The bright headlight helps you see where you're going when it's dark out. It also helps you be seen. The light runs on the bike's battery power so you never have to worry about changing batteries.
 

 

Colorful Handle Bar Side Lights - Choose & change the light color (red when braking.)
 
We know that bikes can sometimes be hard to see... so we made the SMARTIE to be seen from all sides! It' s safe & it's cool!
The side lights can be changed to the color of your choice when running and they turn red when you brake.

Q:  What size rider does this fit?
A:  SMARTIE is designed to fit riders from 5'0 to 6'2""
Q:  How much does SMARTIE weigh?
A: SMARTIE weighs 13.6 kg (30lbs) without battery & 16 kg (35lbs) w/ battery
Q: Can the battery be removed?

Q: How is SMARTIE delivered and is it easy to assemble?
A:  SMARTIE is shipped 100% fully assembled. However, you may want to have it tuned up and checked out at your local bike store once you receive it.
Q: Can I still bike SMARTIE if the battery runs out of power?
A: Yes of course! If the battery runs out of power you can still ride SMARTIE the same as you would a regular bicycle.
Q: How far can I ride on battery power?
A: SMARTIE comes with a 9ah LG lithium ion battery. You can go up to 35  miles on a single charge.
Q: Can I charge the battery by pedaling?
A: No. Regenerative braking require a Direct Drive Motor which is heavy and not typically used in ebikes. They don’t offer a freewheeling mechanism that insulates the rider from the motor. That’s fine when your battery is charged but once your battery runs out of juice it means that when you pedal, not only do need to move yourself and the bike, but you also need to push against the resistance of the heavy motor. That can make for some very tired legs!

<h2>About</h2>
<p>We started and are based out of proud and strong Lethbridge, Alberta. We started because of you. We started because you demanded an airline that took care of you when flying at a height we never thought could be reached. You are family and together we will reach greater heights </p>
<p>The problem in the Airline industry today is that consumers are currently treated as Cattle, Sort of like a number on the screen. These companies now focus on the amount of money they can Squeeze out of each individual Client. Before loyal airlines was started One of The clients I interviewed talked about how she spent over 200 dollars Cad on baggage fees for a vacation trip to Mexico, isn’t that ridiculous, but that isn’t even the tip of the iceberg the U.S. airline industry rake in $4.6 billion last year alone on baggage fees. Think about the last time you paid baggage fees </p>
<p>Secondly, There are a lot of high-cost low-quality airlines out there. Individuals pay up to 200 dollars per trip just to fly out of the Lethbridge Airport in a dingy propeller plane alone. In America the pay half of what we pay and fly out of a regional jet.</p>
<p>Finally, there is no consumer loyalty. Airlines Overbook flights just so they will be able to make the maximum profit per-fight. Which causes paying consumers to lose their seats. There was even a publicized incident, which I am sure you all know about, where they forcibly dragged a paying customer of the plane. when the whole world was outraged, they did some digging into his background and tried to shame him for losing his medical license. Isn’t that just disgusting?</p>
<p>Let’s Talk about the loyal Airline Advantage? Your First Baggage Free up to 25kg, Free Food While Traveling any distance longer than 25 mins, A hostess Included in every flight and Finally first-Class Service for every single costumer.</p>

We have spent years working on road-tested prototypes, which never cease to turn heads, and are now coming out on Indiegogo to give the world a chance to become part of our story. Nobe vehicles are the perfect fusion of ageless beauty and modern technology. There is room for three people, and luggage, with range and speed to match — Nobe can easily manage the daily commute, in all weather conditions, and will be happy joining you for a roadtrip as well. The Tripulse 3-wheel drive system optimises stability and output, giving better traction than most cars on the road today, even on sand and snow. The Delta Frame cage comes from our background in building racing cars and utilises the triangular shape of the car for extra strength. Unlike most other cars, the Nobe can also be endlessly upgraded with new bodies, seats, batteries and even motors, putting an end to our throwaway society.</p><p>Our mission is to change the car industry by bringing fun, class and sustainability back. We have worked incredibly hard to reach this point and hope you will join us in getting your own Nobe, and to make a sustainable, fun future for everyone.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562139798/reuiceqejx3erffbeziw.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>Unique Technology</h3><p> </p><p>✅Three wheel layout optimised for efficiency, speed and stability</p><p>✅ Tripulse all-wheel drive system gives traction in all conditions</p><p>✅ Delta Frame safety cage based on race car technology</p><p>✅ Innovative dual-battery system</p><p>✅ Quality and style both in engineering and design</p><p>✅ Car panels are recyclable</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565167634/woeumhspw7goxzjil3hy.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Structurally the triangle is the strongest geometric shape — stronger than rectangles or squares. Nobe's triangular shape not only helps to improve drag, it provides a sturdy foundation. The engineers at Nobe have backgrounds in developing racing cars, and that knowledge has been used to develop the unique Delta Frame which provides a strong safety barrier. As the frame is separate from the panels, panels can be changed without causing structural problems. If an accident occurs, the frame can also be safely and easily mended to keep that Nobe on the road.</p><p>The Tripulse drive system delivers balances power to all three wheels, giving Nobe superior traction compared to regular 2-wheel-drive cars. Nobe can easily tackle difficult conditions and has great ground clearance to allow it to get through snow and slush. Tripulse also allows Nobe to turn in tight circles, which makes city driving pleasurable.</p><p>The twin battery system allows you to plug our unique battery bag for those occasions when you need that extra bit of range.</p><p>Additionally Nobe has all the usual practical features you would expect from a daily driver, such as air-conditioning, lighting, ABS regenerative brakes and audio.</p><h3>A Car for Life</h3><p>At Nobe, we are making electric driving desirable with an upgradeable, recyclable and sustainable car that doesn’t compromise on style. We want to build a future that means end to the notion of the disposable car, and we have four roads to achieving it:</p><ul>
<li>We will make it easy for you to upgrade the batteries, motors and other electronics as technology evolves and we advance the Nobe model, meaning your vehicle is cutting edge for its entire, very long, lifespan.</li>
<li>We’ll make it possible for you to upgrade other hardware too. Whether it's wear and tear, external damage or simply a desire to change its colour, you can swap exterior panels for new and recycle the old ones with us.</li>
<li>We are a sustainable car maker that will never knowingly contribute to waste. Nobe belongs on the road, not the scrapyard.</li>
<li>The Nobe production facilities will be Nanofactories, making max 2000 cars per year, with new markets emerging we will bring new Nanofactories to these markets and not waste energy on shipping.</li>
</ul><h3> </h3><h3>Nobe team</h3><h3><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/346733105?portrait=0""></iframe></div></h3><p><strong>Our history</strong></p><p>In 2016 we set out to build a modern classic car where vintage design wasn’t the only thing that would stand the test of time. We dreamed of building a vehicle that harked back to decades past, yet innovative in sustainable design, protecting the planet without compromising driving experience.</p><p>Over the past three years we worked tirelessly to develop a model that blended classic car design with innovative technology and are now ready to let our first vehicle onto the road.  </p><p> GENEVA MOTORSHOW: Out of 139 cars BBC picked 10, Nobe 100 among them!</p><blockquote type=""cite""><div dir=""ltr"">

We have spent years working on road-tested prototypes, which never cease to turn heads, and are now coming out on Indiegogo to give the world a chance to become part of our story. Nobe vehicles are the perfect fusion of ageless beauty and modern technology. There is room for three people, and luggage, with range and speed to match — Nobe can easily manage the daily commute, in all weather conditions, and will be happy joining you for a roadtrip as well. The Tripulse 3-wheel drive system optimises stability and output, giving better traction than most cars on the road today, even on sand and snow. The Delta Frame cage comes from our background in building racing cars and utilises the triangular shape of the car for extra strength. Unlike most other cars, the Nobe can also be endlessly upgraded with new bodies, seats, batteries and even motors, putting an end to our throwaway society.Our mission is to change the car industry by bringing fun, class and sustainability back. We have worked incredibly hard to reach this point and hope you will join us in getting your own Nobe, and to make a sustainable, fun future for everyone. Unique Technology ✅Three wheel layout optimised for efficiency, speed and stability✅ Tripulse all-wheel drive system gives traction in all conditions✅ Delta Frame safety cage based on race car technology✅ Innovative dual-battery system✅ Quality and style both in engineering and design✅ Car panels are recyclableStructurally the triangle is the strongest geometric shape — stronger than rectangles or squares. Nobe's triangular shape not only helps to improve drag, it provides a sturdy foundation. The engineers at Nobe have backgrounds in developing racing cars, and that knowledge has been used to develop the unique Delta Frame which provides a strong safety barrier. As the frame is separate from the panels, panels can be changed without causing structural problems. If an accident occurs, the frame can also be safely and easily mended to keep that Nobe on the road.The Tripulse drive system delivers balances power to all three wheels, giving Nobe superior traction compared to regular 2-wheel-drive cars. Nobe can easily tackle difficult conditions and has great ground clearance to allow it to get through snow and slush. Tripulse also allows Nobe to turn in tight circles, which makes city driving pleasurable.The twin battery system allows you to plug our unique battery bag for those occasions when you need that extra bit of range.Additionally Nobe has all the usual practical features you would expect from a daily driver, such as air-conditioning, lighting, ABS regenerative brakes and audio.A Car for LifeAt Nobe, we are making electric driving desirable with an upgradeable, recyclable and sustainable car that doesn’t compromise on style. We want to build a future that means end to the notion of the disposable car, and we have four roads to achieving it:
We will make it easy for you to upgrade the batteries, motors and other electronics as technology evolves and we advance the Nobe model, meaning your vehicle is cutting edge for its entire, very long, lifespan.
We’ll make it possible for you to upgrade other hardware too. Whether it's wear and tear, external damage or simply a desire to change its colour, you can swap exterior panels for new and recycle the old ones with us.
We are a sustainable car maker that will never knowingly contribute to waste. Nobe belongs on the road, not the scrapyard.
The Nobe production facilities will be Nanofactories, making max 2000 cars per year, with new markets emerging we will bring new Nanofactories to these markets and not waste energy on shipping.
 Nobe teamOur historyIn 2016 we set out to build a modern classic car where vintage design wasn’t the only thing that would stand the test of time. We dreamed of building a vehicle that harked back to decades past, yet innovative in sustainable design, protecting the planet without compromising driving experience.Over the past three years we worked tirelessly to develop a model that blended classic car design with innovative technology and are now ready to let our first vehicle onto the road.   GENEVA MOTORSHOW: Out of 139 cars BBC picked 10, Nobe 100 among them!

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b></b></span></p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;""></b></p>
<p><b>Economical </b>- design the inclusive concept to be affordable. to do so we share some responsibilities: b(u)y your self  means getting tools+materials+disposals (some are part of any basic household) will save you a lot of money while letting me focus on the jigless kit critical design attributes. all the  ""around the kit stuff""  can be bought at any local hardware shop or over the internet. the kit includes all the essentials (tubes, profiles,lugs cores and microstructure) all other 'means of production' are easy to get any where. <b>Less than 1 kg package weight</b> - saves a lot on international shipping rate. </p>
<b>Location </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">- no need for designated space for building your bicycle frame, most making process can be done in your living room, while listing your favorite music.</span><br/><p></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""></p>
<p><b>Schedule </b>- at your own pace. after work, on weekends, the next holiday,  it should take about 15-20 hours to complete one frame.</p>
<p><b>Tools* </b>- your old basic tool box should be enough, check the b.o.m for a full list. </p>
<p><b>Materials*</b> - at your local hardware\online shops.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>Know how</b> - fully documented footage,  video tutorials of the making process, will be published on the indiegogo campaign page as well as on tagmenot.com               no need for professional skills or pre knowledge. bring on just tons of curiosity..</p>

<p>_____________________________________________________________________________<b>Q&amp;A</b></p>
<p><b>1. can i use the JIGLESS kit to build a lot of bicycle frames?</b></p>
<div> A kit is  one  bicycle frame. if you are planning  to become a professional bike builder you should look for heavy duty  equipment and  professional training.<br/><br/><b>2. is there any special tools needed for the project?</b><p></p>
<p>if you will look at your toolbox you might find most tools</p>
<p><b>3. <b>do i need a workshop for my frame project?</b></b><br/></p>
<div>most process can be done at the comfort of your  living room.</div>
<div><b>4. do i need pre knowledge or advanced technical skills to make my own frame?</b></div>
<div>the jigless kit was designed for use by a person that never thought he will build a bicycle. having additional knowledge or maker skills it's always a good idea, but totally necessary.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div><b>5. does the jigless kit includes wheels, saddle, handlebar...?</b></div>
<div>the kit includes all frame structure essentials (metal tubes and printed parts).</div>
<div>no other components is supplied with kit.</div>

AND THE JIGLESS

_____________________________________________________________________________
Building  a bicycle from scratch  is a multidisciplinary experience, an excited fabrication process involving art and science, combining design and engineering for the sake of creating a unique bond between the machine and you. With the JIGLESS kit you are about to expand and redefine the D.I.Y concept like never before. taking it to next level of F.I.Y - fabricate it yourself.

The  best bicycle you will ever ride is  a bicycle you build your self, and it should be simple.

_____________________________________________________________________________
JIGLESS is about Reinventing  the way bicycle frame is fabricated.                                  After deep observation on bicycle  frame manufacturing and production technologies, long research and study on materials and engineering, extensive experience in building custom made bicycle, designing fixtures and jigs and riding my bikes thousands of miles, it's about time initiating the first fully operational domestic fabrication unit, unleash the power of 3D desktop printer, in the favor of a new  bicycle frame building concept, made by YOU. 

_____________________________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________________________
The JIGLESS kit is  a  comprehensive  bicycle frame building method, based on 3d parametric printed parts, for anyone who wish to explore and challenge the domestic fabrication capabilities. 
_____________________________________________________________________________


_____________________________________________________________________________

Parametric 3d printed Micro-Structures.
 one of many issues the project deal with is reducing kit's parts weight without  compromising accuracy and tolerance. this led to a whole new building concept: MS (about 2-5 gram each) holding and connecting tubes in place during the making process. the overall package weight  (printed and metal parts for frame) is around 1 kg. in fact the JIGLESS is the lightest bicycle frame building complete system ever produce before. why is that so important?  it reduces the shipping cost dramatically for you. 
____________________________________________________________________________


 


_____________________________________________________________________________
The JIGLESS kit contains a full set of pre cut light aluminum  profiles+tubes and 3D printed parts made of PLA. No special tooling or heavy duty hardware is needed for the JIG (it's jig less, remember?) setup and the frame building process. In fact the kit includes one screw only.
_____________________________________________________________________________


_____________________________________________________________________________
Tubes and profiles are pre-cut to precise measurement,  no need for tube mitering.

...second jigless bicycle frame is now on thy way, updates soon..
_____________________________________________________________________________
Simplicity by accessibility:  domestic manufacturing outcomes should be hi end and low cost. the process of making should be silent, clean and generally speaking, maintain a minimum impact on the surroundings, i would like an extra small footprint please...  for that reason: A workshop, heavy industrial machinery, expansive power tool, exotic hand tools and professional experience are not required to execute your own made jigless frame project.  

_____________________________________________________________________________
THE JIGLESS METHODIs divided into 4 modules, each module consist of easy to follow steps for completing your bicycle frame:
1. setup - denim harvest, measuring, masking, marking tubes
2. tacking - connecting tubes and lugs cores together
3. wrapping - reinforcing lugs and tubes with composite (epoxy+denim fiber) 
4. finishing -  filing, sanding, coating lugs
*Exclusive footage and Detailed  tutorials will be published during the campaign.


_____________________________________________________________________________


MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE BY ALL MEANS


Economical - design the inclusive concept to be affordable. to do so we share some responsibilities: b(u)y your self  means getting tools+materials+disposals (some are part of any basic household) will save you a lot of money while letting me focus on the jigless kit critical design attributes. all the  ""around the kit stuff""  can be bought at any local hardware shop or over the internet. the kit includes all the essentials (tubes, profiles,lugs cores and microstructure) all other 'means of production' are easy to get any where. Less than 1 kg package weight - saves a lot on international shipping rate. 
Location - no need for designated space for building your bicycle frame, most making process can be done in your living room, while listing your favorite music.

Schedule - at your own pace. after work, on weekends, the next holiday,  it should take about 15-20 hours to complete one frame.
Tools* - your old basic tool box should be enough, check the b.o.m for a full list. 
Materials* - at your local hardware\online shops.
Know how - fully documented footage,  video tutorials of the making process, will be published on the indiegogo campaign page as well as on tagmenot.com               no need for professional skills or pre knowledge. bring on just tons of curiosity..
More info - useful links covering many aspect of  bicycle at the bottom of the page.
*while waiting your kit to arrive, you can take care the b.o.m (bill of materials and tools) so you are ready to start your project as soon as you get your kit.

_____________________________________________________________________________









The jigless kit and assembly instructions were developed  according to TAG.ME.NOT best knowledge and practice. By using JIGLESS KIT, you accept the inherent risk of fabricate things yourself. tag.me.not is  not responsible on your making process and results. 
Always make sure you use your mind and senses, engage with your surroundings, because no one can do so for you.

_____________________________________________________________________________Q&A
1. can i use the JIGLESS kit to build a lot of bicycle frames?
 A kit is  one  bicycle frame. if you are planning  to become a professional bike builder you should look for heavy duty  equipment and  professional training.2. is there any special tools needed for the project?
if you will look at your toolbox you might find most tools
3. do i need a workshop for my frame project?
most process can be done at the comfort of your  living room.
4. do i need pre knowledge or advanced technical skills to make my own frame?
the jigless kit was designed for use by a person that never thought he will build a bicycle. having additional knowledge or maker skills it's always a good idea, but totally necessary.


5. does the jigless kit includes wheels, saddle, handlebar...?
the kit includes all frame structure essentials (metal tubes and printed parts).
no other components is supplied with kit.

We are all accustomed to the visual pollution caused by constantly growing number of cars parked on sidewalks, yards, and even lawns. We do not even notice it, but take a moment to look around and you will find that instead of green and nice environment around us there is one large parking lot.</p><div>
<p>According to world's statistics, the number of households with two or more cars has accelerated by more than half a million in the past year, This creates a major issue to find a room for all family vehicles in the yard or garage. Furthermore, people are used to store many other things in garage, so it limits space for both car, and other things like bike or lawn mower. Obviously, it’s not comfortable and it creates a risk of car being scratched. Besides, home owners who have no garage are exposed to car theft or vandalism actions. Also, they are more sensitive to weather impact.</p>
<h3>CARLIFT is a Smart Solution of this Problem</h3>
<p>Our proposed underground car parking system ensures owner’s comfort, guarantees full vehicle protection, and at the same time has no visual impact on surrounding area. Our system is designed to accommodate almost any type of car, including luxury ones and SUV’s.</p>
<p>Compared with traditional garage, up to <strong>70% less land area</strong> &amp; up to <strong>50%</strong> <strong>smaller building volume </strong>are <u>needed for parking an equivalent number of cars</u>.<br/>This gives its owner such <strong>benefits </strong>as:<br/><i><strong>- adding more parking spaces;<br/>- utilizing more area for non-parking purposes;<br/>- maintaining a clean environment by maximizing green spaces.</strong></i></p>
<p>The system involves installing a concrete pit that is equipped with elevating platform (hydraulic scissors lift  with up to 5 tons (11023.11 lbs)<strong> </strong>load capacity) which hosts the vehicle on the required level (ground floor or basement). </p>
<p>The pit walls are made of reinforced concrete and are waterproof. It is entirely invisible from outside, as top platform is covered with the same material as nearby ground (asphalt, gravels, grass, etc.), thus ensuring that the system blends in perfectly with surrounding area.</p>
<p>We are not the ones, who have invented this type of parking, but we are definitely the first to present you <strong>a</strong> <strong>really smart and user friendly underground car parking system</strong>. <br/>Let us introduce our unique features below:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537552678/dn0h818h8bndenrdypb3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>With garage car lift, you can <strong>double your parking space</strong> by parking car underneath another one. This way cars can be <strong>moved independently</strong>. No need to pick and choose who gets garage privileges anymore! No need of planning parking according to who needs to leave the house first!</p>

<p>It helps to position car on parking platform and avoid any damage during parking lot movement. System consists of <strong>infrared sensors</strong> and <strong>LED display</strong> – located in front of driver’s eyes, to navigate and inform driver on car position by showing <strong>animated instructions.</strong></p>

<p><strong>GPS</strong> <strong>location tracker </strong>identifies once system owner's smartphone has reached <strong>“home zone” </strong>and thus sends <strong>automatic notification </strong>on the mobile phone asking for a confirmation on lift movement. You can also set <strong>desired distance</strong>, or create a <strong>time schedule</strong> in the app window “settings”.</p>

<p>A fully automated ventilation (AV) system to obtain continuous air exchange, to control and reduce air humidity, to prevent condensation, and to reduce moisture from cars (rain, snow, ice, etc.). Our AV system considerably helps to prevent mold and corrosion. It consists of <strong>ventilation unit with heat exchanger</strong>, air <strong>temperature </strong>&amp; air <strong>humidity </strong>sensors, and <strong>carbon monoxide </strong>sensor.</p>

<p>System is intended to remove accumulated water from the pit (appearing due to precipitation, ground water leakage, melted snow on car wheels, etc.). Water is removed to ground or user’s existing rainwater drainage system. A <strong>circular gutter</strong> around the upper platform is set up to prevent water entering the pit. At the bottom of the pit a slope is created and a <strong>drainage pump</strong> is installed. Next, two<strong> water level electrodes </strong>are mounted. Once the first electrode is triggered, the drainage pump automatically turns on. If the second electrode is triggered- user receives a <strong>warning </strong>through smartphone.</p>

<p>Designed to protect lifting platform from freezing shut to the ground during winter. It consists of an<strong> electrical</strong> <strong>heating mat </strong>going over the entire ground-level lifting platform, outdoor and indoor <strong>temperature sensors</strong>, and relative<strong> humidity sensor. </strong>The control box measures the weather parameters and according to a control algorithm, determines when there is a risk of freezing. Once risk is detected, electrical heating mat automatically turns on and heats the platform. Another sensor is installed inside the platform's construction, to protect platform from overheating.</p>

<p>The system is designed to protect surrounding ones and avoid any injuries when system operates in automatic mode (platform starts raising automatically when user reaches “home zone”).<br/>The following measures are taken to avoid any possible injuries of kids or pets being near the parking place: <strong>audible alarm</strong> automatically turns on during parking lot movement. In case <strong>motion detector</strong> with 6 m (19.7 ft) radius detects any movement, the system stops and user receives notification through the app. The audible alarm and motion detector are installed in the manual control panel outside.</p>

<p>My name is Liutauras. I am an engineer, a husband, a daddy of eight-year-old’s daughter, as well as a founder of CARLIFT. A few years ago, my family and I have built a private house on a countryside. I was watching my daughter playing with other kids near the house, and an idea grew in mind - we all want to live in a green, cozy and beautiful environment. But in a reality cars are getting more and more into our space. Instead of green healthy neighborhood we live in one huge parking lot. Kids are forced to play around the cars and inhale toxic fumes, rather than on the green yards and playgrounds.</p>
<p>I have shared my idea and vision with more people.. And one day we became a real team. We told ourselves - we will create a product that will not only help millions of people to live in a cleaner, greener and more comfortable environment, but this product will be better than anything else that has been created so far. We have been working on technical and IT solutions for more than a year, and <strong>today we are ready to produce a prototype of the smartest underground parking system. </strong>To make it real, we need further investments and therefore we need your help.</p>
<p><strong>Support us, together we can do this!</strong></p>

We are all accustomed to the visual pollution caused by constantly growing number of cars parked on sidewalks, yards, and even lawns. We do not even notice it, but take a moment to look around and you will find that instead of green and nice environment around us there is one large parking lot.
According to world's statistics, the number of households with two or more cars has accelerated by more than half a million in the past year, This creates a major issue to find a room for all family vehicles in the yard or garage. Furthermore, people are used to store many other things in garage, so it limits space for both car, and other things like bike or lawn mower. Obviously, it’s not comfortable and it creates a risk of car being scratched. Besides, home owners who have no garage are exposed to car theft or vandalism actions. Also, they are more sensitive to weather impact.
CARLIFT is a Smart Solution of this Problem
Our proposed underground car parking system ensures owner’s comfort, guarantees full vehicle protection, and at the same time has no visual impact on surrounding area. Our system is designed to accommodate almost any type of car, including luxury ones and SUV’s.
Compared with traditional garage, up to 70% less land area & up to 50% smaller building volume are needed for parking an equivalent number of cars.This gives its owner such benefits as:- adding more parking spaces;- utilizing more area for non-parking purposes;- maintaining a clean environment by maximizing green spaces.
The system involves installing a concrete pit that is equipped with elevating platform (hydraulic scissors lift  with up to 5 tons (11023.11 lbs) load capacity) which hosts the vehicle on the required level (ground floor or basement). 
The pit walls are made of reinforced concrete and are waterproof. It is entirely invisible from outside, as top platform is covered with the same material as nearby ground (asphalt, gravels, grass, etc.), thus ensuring that the system blends in perfectly with surrounding area.
We are not the ones, who have invented this type of parking, but we are definitely the first to present you a really smart and user friendly underground car parking system. Let us introduce our unique features below:

With garage car lift, you can double your parking space by parking car underneath another one. This way cars can be moved independently. No need to pick and choose who gets garage privileges anymore! No need of planning parking according to who needs to leave the house first!


It helps to position car on parking platform and avoid any damage during parking lot movement. System consists of infrared sensors and LED display – located in front of driver’s eyes, to navigate and inform driver on car position by showing animated instructions.


GPS location tracker identifies once system owner's smartphone has reached “home zone” and thus sends automatic notification on the mobile phone asking for a confirmation on lift movement. You can also set desired distance, or create a time schedule in the app window “settings”.


Installation incorporates a fast-charging station, mounted in the pit, and an electrical socket, integrated in a convenient location on the platform's pillar for charging electric vehicles, while your car is parked underground. 


A fully automated ventilation (AV) system to obtain continuous air exchange, to control and reduce air humidity, to prevent condensation, and to reduce moisture from cars (rain, snow, ice, etc.). Our AV system considerably helps to prevent mold and corrosion. It consists of ventilation unit with heat exchanger, air temperature & air humidity sensors, and carbon monoxide sensor.


System is intended to remove accumulated water from the pit (appearing due to precipitation, ground water leakage, melted snow on car wheels, etc.). Water is removed to ground or user’s existing rainwater drainage system. A circular gutter around the upper platform is set up to prevent water entering the pit. At the bottom of the pit a slope is created and a drainage pump is installed. Next, two water level electrodes are mounted. Once the first electrode is triggered, the drainage pump automatically turns on. If the second electrode is triggered- user receives a warning through smartphone.


Designed to protect lifting platform from freezing shut to the ground during winter. It consists of an electrical heating mat going over the entire ground-level lifting platform, outdoor and indoor temperature sensors, and relative humidity sensor. The control box measures the weather parameters and according to a control algorithm, determines when there is a risk of freezing. Once risk is detected, electrical heating mat automatically turns on and heats the platform. Another sensor is installed inside the platform's construction, to protect platform from overheating.


In a standard CARLIFT set, hydraulic scissors lift has 5 tons (11023.11 lbs) load capacity (lower and upper platform loads up to 2,5t (5511.6 lbs). It can also be customized upon request, adapting to heavier vehicles, i.e. SUV`s or trucks. 


The system is designed to protect surrounding ones and avoid any injuries when system operates in automatic mode (platform starts raising automatically when user reaches “home zone”).The following measures are taken to avoid any possible injuries of kids or pets being near the parking place: audible alarm automatically turns on during parking lot movement. In case motion detector with 6 m (19.7 ft) radius detects any movement, the system stops and user receives notification through the app. The audible alarm and motion detector are installed in the manual control panel outside.


You can control whole underground car parking system through our smartphone application. Everything, starting from inside/outside temperature, air humidity, settings of all devices are displayed and can be configured through the app.
How it works:

Whole system is controlled by the main controller, installed in the control box;
All devices (sensors, switches, electric motors, etc.) are connected to the main controller;
The main controller is connected to the Internet via Cable, or Wi-Fi;
Main controller is constantly exchanging data with the app – sends information on each device and receives control commands from the app.
In case of troubles with communication, or internet connection loss, you can always reach main functions in manual control mode.
Main controller  keeps history data of all parameters, so our engineers are available to connect to each individual CARLIFT system and troubleshoot most of the problems remotely via internet.
To prevent unauthorized logins, all accounts are password protected.

 

CARLIFT Smartphone Application

 



Color Themes
Four application themes are available: Dark Grey, Marine Blue, Forest Green and Indigo Purple. Because we all love to customize our life.. and apps! :)

CARLIFT smartphone application is suitable both for Android and iOS operating systems, and will be available at App Store and Google Play.

With CARLIFT our environment could look greener. Just imagine, clean, aesthetic, comfortable and safe environment. We could have green yards, flower gardens, chill zones, and kids playgrounds instead of parking lots near our homes.




According to European insurance companies there are multiple car damage and property loss cases registered in car parking lots. This indicates that such parking is a perfect place to thieves and offers poor security. With CARLIFT's anti-theft system , you'll be able to feel absolutely calm.How it works:There are position switches on both, lifting platform and service trapdoor. If an unauthorized opening is detected an audible alarm turns on and user receives an immediate notification on mobile. CARLIFT can also be connected to user's burglar system, and immediately notify security company of a break-in case.

The main controller can be connected to the internet via a cable or Wi-Fi. Keep in mind, that you can use CARLIFT in manual mode and internet connection is not vital for system to operate.

A service trapdoor is installed to get to underground space by ladder for system maintenance and repairs. The service trapdoor is locked with electromagnetic lock (which is unlocked by turning a key on the outside control panel). The inside light automatically turns on once position switches located on service trapdoor are triggered. 

CARLIFT offers its user remote monitoring and failure diagnosis of all devices (e.g. defrost, drive assist, ventilation, drainage, motion detector, etc.) and gauges (e.g. temperature, CO level, water level) through the app. If any fault is detected, user receives notification. It is possible to fix multiple issues remotely through the app.User can always connect with our maintenance specialists (24/7 customer support) for their advice or troubleshoot.

<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>What are we raising funds for and how do we plan to pull it off?</strong></p>
<p>We are asking for your support to help us spread the word on our great social project. First, we are planning to start an advertisement campaign on Chicago's Blue Line Trains, which run to O'Hare Airport. The minimum monthly fee for such advertisement is $3,000. We need to advertise our service for at least 3 months to have a successful campaign. If we receive more than $10,000 during our Indiegogo campaign, we will be able to share information about our services on a larger scale. </p>
<p>In exchange for your support, we have created several types of membership plans to our services. The description of the plans is in the pledge section.</p>
<p><strong>5. Which passenger flight rights are violated most frequently?</strong></p>
<p>The most frequently violated air passenger right is the right for reimbursement and compensation. There is a great Latin phrase: “ignorantia legis neminem excusat,” which basically means that ignorance of law excuses no one. For air passengers, this phrase means that even when one doesn’t know or use his or her rights, it doesn’t mean that one doesn’t have or cannot use those rights.

<p><strong>7. Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>There are absolutely no risks, since from the time of our establishment, we have already helped thousands of air passengers.</p>

</div></div>","1. Do you know that each year 8 million air passengers are entitled to compensation for a delayed, canceled or overbooked flight? Surprisingly, only 2 percent of those passengers file a claim with airlines!


 
2. Do you know that you can be entitled to compensation of up to $700 when your flight is delayed, or canceled?



 
3. Do you know that you can be entitled to reimbursement of up to $1,600 when your luggage is damaged, delayed, or lost on an international flight?


4. What are we raising funds for and how do we plan to pull it off?
We are asking for your support to help us spread the word on our great social project. First, we are planning to start an advertisement campaign on Chicago's Blue Line Trains, which run to O'Hare Airport. The minimum monthly fee for such advertisement is $3,000. We need to advertise our service for at least 3 months to have a successful campaign. If we receive more than $10,000 during our Indiegogo campaign, we will be able to share information about our services on a larger scale. 
In exchange for your support, we have created several types of membership plans to our services. The description of the plans is in the pledge section.
5. Which passenger flight rights are violated most frequently?
The most frequently violated air passenger right is the right for reimbursement and compensation. There is a great Latin phrase: “ignorantia legis neminem excusat,” which basically means that ignorance of law excuses no one. For air passengers, this phrase means that even when one doesn’t know or use his or her rights, it doesn’t mean that one doesn’t have or cannot use those rights. As a matter of fact, perhaps because of this reason, the law allows one to file a flight-related claim up to 2 years (or even 7 years in UK) after the issue occurred.
It is important to keep in mind, however, that the kinds of rights afforded to air passengers depend on the country of their residence. They also depend on one’s departure and arrival points. In what follows we make some important distinctions: 
A. In the United States, for example, in the event of domestic delays and cancelations, airlines are not statutorily obligated to compensate anything, and this is a cold and cruel fact. In the event of overbookings in the US, consumer rights protection allows compensation of up to $1350 when you are bumped from a flight.  
More information about your rights in the event of an overbooking in the US is available on our website: 
www.eurodelays.com


 
B. European Union air passenger regulations have a different approach to targeting flight-related issues and efficiently protect air passengers. 

For example, in the events of a flight delay, cancelation, or overbooking, one can receive up to $700 in cash compensation. Some of our clients have received several thousand dollars in compensation for just one flight. Additionally, in some specific circumstances, airlines have to provide their customers hotel accommodations as well as food and refreshments. When dealing with extraordinary circumstances such as strikes, social events, weather conditions, etc. the air passenger has the right to be reimbursed for their ticket.

<p><br/><strong><font color=""#E51075"">Alien Electronics LTD </font> is a UK company that was established in 2012. In the early years we began by researching and developing products for the radio control and electric vehicle market. Initially we supplied parts for private and commercial clients.  However, over the last few years, with a background and passion for electric mobility, we have begun to design and develop full electric vehicles. </strong></p>

<strong><font color=""#E51075"">This campaign is important </font> </strong>to us as we will be able to launch our first complete electric vehicle in mass production and then start the next new vehicle development we have been working on. </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<strong>Being in this market </strong>already has helped us to develop the vehicle in full and has kept the<strong> relationship with our longstanding partners and suppliers very strong. </strong>We have made most of the necessary agreements with our manufacturers prior to launching this campaign. This helps to minimise risk for any potential obstacles and delays along the way. </li></ul>

<div style=""width:70%;float:right;margin-left:10px;"">
<p><font color=""#E51075""><strong>DUAL SENSORED ELECTRONIC SPEED CONTROLLER:</strong></font></p>
<p>The dual channel ESC has been developed for perfect control of the power train. <strong><font color=""#E51075"">The new ECU</font></strong> <strong>is able to monitor engine speed, vehicle speed, and other factors then ensure a perfect power output for a smooth ride.</strong> The 2 motors are separately controlled to ensure <strong>optimal traction</strong>. This function can be tuned by selecting the different riding modes. Here are a few of the ESC specifications;</p>
<ul>
<li>power of 45A continuous current for each motor with a peak of 100A</li>
<li>
<strong>field-oriented control</strong> for a more precise and efficient operation</li>
<li>refresh rate of the throttle signal <strong>50Hz to 450Hz</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>optical signal transmission</strong> system to avoid interference</li>
<li>high performance microprocessor</li>
<li>temperature, voltage, current and signal loss <strong>protection</strong>
</li>
<li>integrated energy recovery system that uses the motors as a generator while braking to recover battery energy</li>
<li><strong>programmable riding mode</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><br/><font color=""#E51075""><strong>DUAL SENSORED HUB BRUSHLESS MOTORS:</strong></font><strong><strong>  </strong></strong></p>
<p>These motors have been developed for maximum reliability and designed for maximum efficiency. The problem with skateboard HUB motors is the heat. Heat generation means loss of efficiency, therefore power. With the design and parts used for the internal components, these motors are more efficient. <strong>Their case includes a <font color=""#E51075"">CNC designed FAN</font> that helps to cool the motor during the rotation.</strong> The air is forced inside the motor from the middle of the deck and expulsed from the external by the holes on the outside plate. Internal components are all waterproof. <strong><font color=""#E51075"">Ceramic bearngs</font></strong> help to keep the temperature lower and are maintenance free. The motors are 95% <strong>Freewheeling</strong> if not powered so the board feels like a normal longboard if pushed. An 83mm size urethane wheel is used on the motor. This can be easily replaced if needed, simply by taking off the retainer outside plate and pulling out the wheel. The longer length of the motor can, magnet and stator make them <strong>more powerful</strong> compared to the majority of the HUB motors available on the market. </p>

<p>The Electronic cover has been made by an injection moulding process. Here is located the <strong>core of the system</strong>, the logic and power board. The integrated <strong><font color=""#E51075"">5V USB port</font></strong> is perfect to charge the remote control, but can be used for any device that requires a 5V supply like a smartphone or similar. The design incorporates an<font color=""#E51075""> <strong>integrated handle</strong></font> for transportation. This helps the user to keep the deck vertical instead of horizontal so the transport in urban environments is much easier as the board takes up less space.</p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><br/><font color=""#E51075""><strong>11S3P - 18650 SONY BATTERY PACK:</strong></font><strong><strong>  </strong></strong></p>
<p>Why Sony? Well, the brand speaks for itself. We chose the <font color=""#E51075""><strong>SONY</strong> <strong>VTC6</strong></font> after a long period of testing. Compared with other high end batteries these run at a slightly higher voltage and lower temperature by delivering a higher current. Very few batteries can handle high current as well as these. <strong>Why 11S3P?</strong> Most of the battery packs used on electric skateboards are 10S2p or 4P. Using 11S means having a higher voltage.  The advantage is to have a lower current draw, so the motor can run cooler, and at a higher speed. 3P with a 3000mah cell means a <strong><font color=""#E51075"">9000mAh</font></strong> battery pack. <strong><font color=""#E51075"">9000mAh</font></strong> gives an impressive range of <strong><font color=""#E51075"">48 Km</font></strong> <strong>with top performances</strong>, and still keeps the weight low compared with a bulky 4P battery.</p>

<p>Bushings, pivot cups and washers are probably the smallest parts of the hardware, <strong>but very important in terms of comfort and control</strong>. The main factor to consider is their shape and durometer.

<p>Bearings are an important part of any set up. <strong><font color=""#E51075"">Si3N4</font></strong> <strong>bearings are lighter, harder, and stronger</strong>. They are designed to handle more friction and be cooler, which allows them to roll faster and longer. <strong><font color=""#E51075"">Titanium</font></strong> coated with a built-in spacer, they have a much higher heat tolerance than steel ball bearings. <strong><font color=""#E51075"">Ceramic bearings</font></strong> are waterproof so there is no risk of rust if not lubricated. These bearings are used on the front wheels and in the HUB motors.</p>

In the early years we began by researching and developing products for the radio control and electric vehicle market. Initially we supplied parts for private and commercial clients.  However, over the last few years, with a background and passion for electric mobility, we have begun to design and develop full electric vehicles. 

 

This campaign is important  to us as we will be able to launch our first complete electric vehicle in mass production and then start the next new vehicle development we have been working on. 

Being in this market already has helped us to develop the vehicle in full and has kept the relationship with our longstanding partners and suppliers very strong. We have made most of the necessary agreements with our manufacturers prior to launching this campaign. This helps to minimise risk for any potential obstacles and delays along the way. 
 
​
 


We chose INDIEGOGO  because we believe that our backers will play a crucial role in the launch and further development of this vehicle. Through INDIEGOGO  we’re not just pre-selling our product, we are joining a passionate community of innovators and visionaries. We are really excited about the launch and the continuation of our journey.  Most importantly we are excited about fulfilling our promise to our backers. 
Making a revolutionary product is never easy.  You have our assurance though that we will always try our best to make sure everything goes according to plan and to meet the promised deadlines successfully once we reach our funding goal.

 

​

All the funds  will be used for the mass production and future development of additional ""add on"" parts that can be easily swapped making the product fully upgradable.  This means that any new part can be used on an existing PREDATOR  with no need to buy the latest model.
We really appreciate all the help of contributors, existing clients and people that can simply share this project and spread the word. Everyone who helps us in the making of the PREDATOR V4R , will get it at lower price and will be the first to be offered exclusive perks and a special  cupon code to be used in our webstore for a special discount on every product.
 

 




The all new  APS PREDATOR V4R combines the most important aspects, we believe people today are looking for, in an electric vehicle; Innovation, safety, performance and materials. With the PREDATOR V4R our engineering experts have designed and developed a top spec product with the help and assistance of customer feedback over the years. The V4R has been extensively tested to ensure a user friendly electric longboard with top end components. An electric longboard is not a toy, it is an electric vehicle, and as such the use of composite, metal, and aerospace grade materials make the difference in the look, weight and handling of the board. Every part of the Longboard, from a simple washer to the main battery has been designed and made to the highest specification. We have tested and compared our board with many electric longboards that the market offers today, from the cheapest to the most expensive to ensure that the V4R is the best all round product. Due to different client requirements the complete electronics and hardware assembly have been designed in a way that the rider can easily swap to any deck in 10 minutes by using the hardware provided. All the parts used are standard longboard fitment. We have created a deck that is ergonomic to suit a large variety of clients. The ride experience is perfectly balanced, and the product is not too extreme or too moderate. All parts including the deck size, wheels, trucks, electronics have been designed to meet the best compromise between performance and comfort.
  
 
The beautifully designed Maple and CARBON FIBRE deck allows fantastic control and stability when riding and provides at the same time flexibility and vibration absorption. The custom made SONY battery pack gives an Incredible 48 Km range. The innovative speed controller and motors combo allows a top speed of 55 Kmph.  These performances are possible thanks to the 2x long stator sensored brushless HUB motors with 1600 Watt peak power per motor. Power output, brake force and riding mode can be selected by the user through the remote control (and an APP in second development) so anyone can choose the power output most suitable. Safety first.
 

 
A weight and pressure sensor added on to the deck can detect the rider position then smart cut off the power to reduce the risk of the rider falling off. If the sensor will detect a complete loss of the rider weight the board will automatically stop.

For the ultimate in electric skateboard technology and performance, look no further than the PREDATOR V4R.  An exciting addition to city transportation. 

 
All of what you have read about our product so far is the result of years of extensive research and testing. The outcome is an uncompromising, perfectly balanced longboard, with a sleek design, sharp edges and impressive performances.  Compact, light and easy to carry in an urban environment, this is a crafted product we designed with a passion for innovation. 
 

 

 

 
COMPONENTS USED FOR THE PRODUCT:
 


DUAL SENSORED ELECTRONIC SPEED CONTROLLER:
The dual channel ESC has been developed for perfect control of the power train. The new ECU is able to monitor engine speed, vehicle speed, and other factors then ensure a perfect power output for a smooth ride. The 2 motors are separately controlled to ensure optimal traction. This function can be tuned by selecting the different riding modes. Here are a few of the ESC specifications;

power of 45A continuous current for each motor with a peak of 100A

field-oriented control for a more precise and efficient operation
refresh rate of the throttle signal 50Hz to 450Hz


optical signal transmission system to avoid interference
high performance microprocessor
temperature, voltage, current and signal loss protection

integrated energy recovery system that uses the motors as a generator while braking to recover battery energy
programmable riding mode

 
DUAL SENSORED HUB BRUSHLESS MOTORS:  
These motors have been developed for maximum reliability and designed for maximum efficiency. The problem with skateboard HUB motors is the heat. Heat generation means loss of efficiency, therefore power. With the design and parts used for the internal components, these motors are more efficient. Their case includes a CNC designed FAN that helps to cool the motor during the rotation. The air is forced inside the motor from the middle of the deck and expulsed from the external by the holes on the outside plate. Internal components are all waterproof. Ceramic bearngs help to keep the temperature lower and are maintenance free. The motors are 95% Freewheeling if not powered so the board feels like a normal longboard if pushed. An 83mm size urethane wheel is used on the motor. This can be easily replaced if needed, simply by taking off the retainer outside plate and pulling out the wheel. The longer length of the motor can, magnet and stator make them more powerful compared to the majority of the HUB motors available on the market. 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 


ABS ELECTRONICS ENCLOSURE:  
The Electronic cover has been made by an injection moulding process. Here is located the core of the system, the logic and power board. The integrated 5V USB port is perfect to charge the remote control, but can be used for any device that requires a 5V supply like a smartphone or similar. The design incorporates an integrated handle for transportation. This helps the user to keep the deck vertical instead of horizontal so the transport in urban environments is much easier as the board takes up less space.
 
11S3P - 18650 SONY BATTERY PACK:  
Why Sony? Well, the brand speaks for itself. We chose the SONY VTC6 after a long period of testing. Compared with other high end batteries these run at a slightly higher voltage and lower temperature by delivering a higher current. Very few batteries can handle high current as well as these. Why 11S3P? Most of the battery packs used on electric skateboards are 10S2p or 4P. Using 11S means having a higher voltage.  The advantage is to have a lower current draw, so the motor can run cooler, and at a higher speed. 3P with a 3000mah cell means a 9000mAh battery pack. 9000mAh gives an impressive range of 48 Km with top performances, and still keeps the weight low compared with a bulky 4P battery.
 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 


BATTERY CHARGER:
INPUT: 100-120 \ 220-240v AC, 50-60 Hz
OUTPUT: 5Ah - 46.2v
CHARGER PLUG: EU standard with US, UK, AU adapter
ALLOY CASE with FAN and LED light for charging indicator
FUSED
 
ABS BATTERY ENCLOSURE: 
As is the Electronic enclosure, the battery cover has been made by an injection moulding process. A useful LCD display  has been added to check the battery status.


 
 
 
 
 


 


BMS (battery management system):  
The BMS has been developed by a Chinese company specialising in PCM/BMS/CMB/PCB exclusively. To ensure best quality, the company is not only equipped with advanced manufacturing facilities, but also with an in house strict QC management system and it employs well experienced engineers and skilful workers. With its small size this BMS is built in the battery to keep everything as compact as possible. With its impressive continuous current of 80A and pulse of 120A, the BMS can deliver the current that the motor needs during hard acceleration and heavy working conditions. Cell voltage balance, temperature monitor, cut off protections, gauge monitor are just few of the BMS features.
 
184MM CNC MACHINED ALIEN PRECISION TRUCK: 
The advantages of using precision trucks is to have more precise tolerances on all the components for a better riding experience that is fluid and responsive. The bushing design provides a stable center without compromising on maneuverability and the wheels have a better grip on the ground.

 
 
 

 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 



BUSHINGS:
Bushings, pivot cups and washers are probably the smallest parts of the hardware, but very important in terms of comfort and control. The main factor to consider is their shape and durometer. Rider weight and riding style are important aspects.  We chose the bushing to have a perfect balanced Longboard that is stable at high speed and keeps a good agility. The bushing washers are Titanium CNC machined.
CERAMIC BEARINGS:  
Bearings are an important part of any set up. Si3N4 bearings are lighter, harder, and stronger. They are designed to handle more friction and be cooler, which allows them to roll faster and longer. Titanium coated with a built-in spacer, they have a much higher heat tolerance than steel ball bearings. Ceramic bearings are waterproof so there is no risk of rust if not lubricated. These bearings are used on the front wheels and in the HUB motors.
 

 

 

 
 



 
 
 



 
CNC MACHINED TITANIUM BOLTS:
Every bolt, from the trucks kingpin to the case screws are made in Titanium grade 5. Why did we choose to use expensive Titanium hardware? To give you an idea, a 5-grade Titanium bolt is 4 times stronger than a 316 stainless steel bolt at nearly half of the weight.
 
DECK:  
A 7 ply Canadian maple and 1 ply CARBON FIBRE structure make the 40"" deck extremely light and strong. The electronics and battery are separate in 2 different boxes placed on the rear and front of the board. This makes the deck extremely flexible in the middle and gives the feeling of riding on a normal longboard.
 

 

 

 
 
 
 

 

 


REMOTE CONTROL:
The ergonomic remote control has 2 modes to familiarise with the performances, perfect for beginners with low mode and first-time users. High mode will allow the system to use its full power and acceleration with hill climb capabilities of up to 30% grade. Forward and reverse action on the trigger can be reversed to better suit the riders style. The LCD display on the remote will show the rider info like real monitor motors temperature, battery capacity, speed and others useful information. Riding mode can be selected to best suit any rider requirements.
WHEELS:  
The well-known 83mm Alien wheels are the perfect balance for traction and slide response. Not as hard as 76mm and not as soft as 90mm, these 83mm wheel with a 78A durometer will allow a good grip and low wheel wears. The core design reduces weight while providing precision riding. Excellent traction control and smooth riding

 
 

 

 
 
 
 


LIGHTS: 
LED lights are used on the front and rear of the deck to add safety and visibility during night rides. The lights are super bright CREE LED, integrated in both the front and rear ABS enclosures of the deck.",35.0,0,"1 Campaign

A freeboard typically has 6 wheels: four normal longboard-style wheels at each corner and two spring-locked center wheels. The center wheels can turn freely in all directions, allowing the board to ""slide"" laterally. This mimics the traditional ""side-to-side"" motion of snowboard riding. By putting pressure on the corner wheels, the rider is able to control the board.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615855697/uzecrykqknhsrhtmzgdi.jpg"" src=""""/></p><div style=""text-align: center;"">

<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">In addition to snowboarding, the feeling of going down a steep hill with a freeboard is hard to beat, but sometimes there are no hills or even a slight bump in the road. That's where the electric drive kit comes into use and turns any street into fresh powder.  This is the first electric drive kit for freeboards just like the Mellow drive was for standard skateboards. Add the drive kit to your board and you can ride when and wherever you want. The two in-wheel motors can smoothly accelerate you to top speeds of up to 25 mph / 40 km/h and bring you up-hills to a 30% grade. </p>

I've been snowboarding for over 20+ years but never heard of freeboarding. I discovered freeboarding thru my Instagram feed where a company called Leiftech advertised their electric skateboard that moved like a snowboard. They used catchy phrases like ""Snowboard all year round"", ""Snowboard the streets"" and ""Start your season that never ends"" and I got intrigued. ​The Leiftech board (nowadays called the Summerboard) seemed really expensive ($1800) and I started looking around for other options. And that's when I discovered freeboarding and the Freebord community. </p><p> </p><p>After watching 100+ hours of freeboarding I decided to buy my own board. I couldn’t really let go of the thought of an electric freeboard version so I decided to try to build my own out of my newly bought freeboard. I really like to mix electronics with mechanics so this project suited me well. The first prototype idea was to combine the One Wheel and the Freebord but eventually, I decided to make the prototype as simple as it could be, with no pressure sensors or advanced gyro programming and I went for a simple remote controller to control the speed. ​</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616592051/nvxpdch4s2qeolhacoqh.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><div>

</div></div></div>","This 6-wheel specialized skateboard is called a freeboard. A freeboard typically has 6 wheels: four normal longboard-style wheels at each corner and two spring-locked center wheels. The center wheels can turn freely in all directions, allowing the board to ""slide"" laterally. This mimics the traditional ""side-to-side"" motion of snowboard riding. By putting pressure on the corner wheels, the rider is able to control the board. 
 
 

 
In addition to snowboarding, the feeling of going down a steep hill with a freeboard is hard to beat, but sometimes there are no hills or even a slight bump in the road. That's where the electric drive kit comes into use and turns any street into fresh powder.  This is the first electric drive kit for freeboards just like the Mellow drive was for standard skateboards. Add the drive kit to your board and you can ride when and wherever you want. The two in-wheel motors can smoothly accelerate you to top speeds of up to 25 mph / 40 km/h and bring you up-hills to a 30% grade. 
 

 
      

 

 
 

 
​
      In 2018 when I moved from Sweden to the US I had no idea there was something called a freeboard. I've been snowboarding for over 20+ years but never heard of freeboarding. I discovered freeboarding thru my Instagram feed where a company called Leiftech advertised their electric skateboard that moved like a snowboard. They used catchy phrases like ""Snowboard all year round"", ""Snowboard the streets"" and ""Start your season that never ends"" and I got intrigued. ​The Leiftech board (nowadays called the Summerboard) seemed really expensive ($1800) and I started looking around for other options. And that's when I discovered freeboarding and the Freebord community.  After watching 100+ hours of freeboarding I decided to buy my own board. I couldn’t really let go of the thought of an electric freeboard version so I decided to try to build my own out of my newly bought freeboard. I really like to mix electronics with mechanics so this project suited me well. The first prototype idea was to combine the One Wheel and the Freebord but eventually, I decided to make the prototype as simple as it could be, with no pressure sensors or advanced gyro programming and I went for a simple remote controller to control the speed. ​

The first freeboard was created in 1996 by Steen Strand (Snap Inc, Icon Aircraft) in Palo Alto, CA while studying for his master’s in product design at Stanford University. Steen wanted to find a way to bring the snowboard ride to the street and began developing prototypes of a skateboard that could slide, drift and stop just like on snow.

Share your journey with others and even know when someone is messing with your ride.
 

 
Is someone messing with your motorcycle? Is someone stealing your motorcycle? Ridesafe will notify you with exactly what is going on including live location tracking so you can sort it out!
 
 

 
Share your memorable journey with anyone anywhere so they know what you're up to. You can now save and track each of your trips, speeds, angles, and acceleration to brag with your friends. If you have a fitness tracker Ridesafe is the tracker for your motorcycle.
 

We don’t like to think about it but when the worse happens we want to make sure we are covered. If you have an accident RideSafe will notify a loved one and contact medical services with your GPS location and medical profile. 
 
 


RideSafe is a dedicated device for motorcycles that integrates the standard Emergency Call system. We are setting out to increase road safety for everyone and enhance your cruising experience. Very excited to continue our journey with your support!  
RideSafe was developed as an IoT device to increase driver safety, reduce emergency services response times, record your rides, and share your performance via a mobile app and desktop. The standalone device is the most integrated and optimized emergency and performance solution for bikers!
The embedded device is your quick-thinking assistant that can save your life and improve your experience on the road. It aligns your touring experience to future trends. Using complex algorithms, the device integrates easily with your motorcycle and comes with a user-friendly app.


We started small in 2015 with a simple idea to bring more safety on the road. Ever since then, we have grown into a close-knit community with a strong focus on automotive embedded software as well as passion for smart bikes. Our next step is thinking big! Both in terms of plans and community members. Together we stand a chance to reduce accidents, improve our tour experience, and share all our amazing achievements.



The device can be fully managed from your iPhone or Android phone, and it takes up little space in the battery box of your bike. The software is developed by a team of expert engineers and it is optimized in-house for the hardware. Within a small estate, the embedded device integrates top-notch technologies and takes action in critical situations.
We wrote more than 2,000,000 lines of code and rode over 100,000 minutes on the track so that we could optimize the device. But we geared up and went the extra mile! We have been continuously improving the device for over 2 years, adding new features requested by bikers who’ve tried out the device.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>An article released on August 11, 2016 states, ""More than 200,000 crashes involved debris on U.S. roadways during the past four years, according to a new study released by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, resulted in approximately 39,000 injuries and more than 500 deaths between 2011 and 2014. AAA is calling for drivers to properly secure their loads to prevent dangerous debris.</p>
<p>Nearly 37 percent of all deaths in road debris crashes resulted from the driver swerving to avoid hitting an object. Over-correcting at the last minute to avoid debris can increase a driver’s risk of losing control of their vehicle and make a bad situation worse.</p>
<p>More than one in three crashes involving debris occur between 10:00 a.m. and 3:59 p.m., a time when many people are on the road hauling or moving heavy items like furniture or construction equipment.</p>
<p>Debris-related crashes are much more likely to occur on Interstate highways. Driving at high speeds increases the risk for vehicle parts to become detached or cargo to fall onto the roadway</p>
<p>About two-thirds of debris-related crashes are the result of items falling from a vehicle due to improper maintenance and unsecured loads. The most common types of vehicle debris are:</p>
<p>Parts becoming detached from a vehicle (tires, wheels, etc.) and falling onto the roadway</p>
<p>Unsecured cargo like furniture, appliances and other items falling onto the roadway</p>
<p>Tow trailers becoming separated and hitting another vehicle or landing on the roadway""</p>

<p><br/>With a 40% increase in debris related accidents since the study began, 16 states including Texas and Washington have implemented laws holding drivers responsible for improperly securing items on pickup truck and debris falling from their vehicle.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The greatest risk associated with road debris is that one more person becomes maimed or is killed due to roadside rubbish. We can't count on the county inmates from the  Department Of Corrections to make sure our highways are clear of dangerous debris in the road.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge our company faces is raising enough capital to get the Cargo Divider System to market. Once we get past this initial stage, BedLock Systems, LLC can have a significant impact on how vehicles secure their cargo.</p>

Risks & ChallengesThe challenges with the service would be competing with Uber and Lyft.  However, we plan to focus on the security and personal aspects that our service provides.  Can you imagine the feeling of being picked up by a well dressed security professional for your rides? Can you imagine sending a package or freight with security? This is what we plan to create - a feeling of safety in logistics.  
Other Ways You Can Help
Please remember that any amount helps.  However, if you are unable to help financially, please get the word out by using the share tools. 
Thanks in advance for your consideration in helping J Seven grow into reality.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Tideline has been operating a commuter ferry service between the Berkeley Marina and Pier 1.5 since March 2017.</p>
<p>We have received many requests to add another boat for this route .  Here is what people are saying about Tideline...</p>
<p>""a life changing experience""</p>
<p>""a favorite part of the day""</p>
<p>""refreshing and invigorating"" </p>
<p>Tideline would like more people to experience a friendly, fast and affordable commute, that is why we are crowdfunding more lines of service between Berkeley and San Francisco</p>
<p>We are pre-selling monthly passes at $290 and one Roundtrip Tickets at $16.  We need $7,500 to launch, but more importantly we need committed riders to keep the service going.</p>
<p>Here is the proposed schedule:</p>
<p>Berkeley Departures:                                                     San Francisco Departures:</p>
<p>8:00am and 9:00am                                                        8:30am and 9:30am</p>
<p>5:30pm and 6:30pm                                                        6:00pm and 7:00pm</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each one-way trip takes 25-30 minutes between the Berkeley Marina and Pier 1.5 in San Francisco (including boarding and disembarking). Riders board at the K Dock at Berkeley Marina in front of Harbormaster’s office (next to Hana Japan Restaurant). The Berkeley Marina is on bus line 81, which goes to UC Berkeley, BART, and the Berkeley Capitol Corridor Amtrak Station. Our riders are also permitted to park for free across the street in the South Sailing Basin gravel parking lot near the UC Aquatic Center.</p>
<p>We have been so lucky to receive so much support for our service.  Tideline appreciates you sharing our campaign on social outlets like Facebook, Twitter and even Next Door.  Everybody deserves a great commute.</p>

<h3>
<strong>Hello! My name is Don Ladanyi and I am a bio-medical engineer with degrees in law, engineering and medicine</strong>. I have been a new product developer since 1962 with my first endeavor being a team member in the development of the very first portable heart defibrillator. You can find me on LinkedIn.</h3>
<p>Recently, I went all-in on the development of Essential Powder® for the FASTEST temporary relief of occasional acid reflux (GERD), heartburn and indigestion anywhere. And it's a big hit for We Got The Beet, LLC.  Unfortunately, I let the DynaVizor® project slide to the side for lack of ""essential"" funding on my part...</p>
<p>But fortunately, I have an in-place agreement with the world's largest manufacturer of window tint films to do a one day production run of the DynaVizors® that would normally cost $10,000 for the service. All I have to do is come up with the raw materials, that being (1) the relatively expensive photochromic dyes, (2) the carrier, a clear window film substrate and (3) the clear coat, solvent-based matrix material that will contain the photochromic dyes and our patented photochromic longevity technology.</p>
<p>Any additional funding beyond my stated $20,000 goal will be used to buy more of the necessary materials to do an even bigger single day production run. The finished DynaVizor® products will be sold in pairs for $19.95 via our website at <a href=""http://www.dynatint.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.dynatint.com</a> and through ""As-Seen-On-TV"" independent marketers that have promised significant TV air time when the product actually becomes physically available.</p>
<p>There is no product like this anywhere in the marketplace and certainly not one that can claim the years of longevity that the DynaVizor® product can deliver. And it even works <u>behind</u> windshield glass! A huge stumbling block for any potential competitors.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my stated goal, then the funds available will hopefully be enough to do a small pilot run of several hundred pairs (or maybe even a thousand) of the DynaVizors® rather than 15,000.</p>
<p>As of today, we have over 2,700 Facebook ""Likes"" with just about as many ""Followers"" eagerly awaiting this product's introduction. Now, that's some amazing Facebook ""Follower"" numbers!</p>
<p>Oh, and what are the main features and benefits of the DynaVizor®? </p>
<p>1. It's a true ""peel &amp; stick"" product. If you don't align it up to quite your liking, just peel it back off and start to lay it down again. It's that easy!</p>
<p>2.It is totally clear at night yet darkens proportionally to the intensity of the daytime sunlight. It even works on rainy, cloudy, overcast days. It's that sensitive. </p>
<p>3. It transitions FAST and automatically. Sun and it goes dark, no sun and it quickly fades to clear.</p>
<p>4. Great for people with sight challenges that have to avoid bright sunlight but offers clear, unobstructed, night-time vision.</p>
<p>5. Superior UV sunlight eye and skin protection. For truckers, placing the DynaVizors® on a side window can avoid the commonplace ""farmer's tan.""</p>
<p>6. Perks? Indiegogo funders will get a special and sizable discount once the DynaVizor® product hits the market (via our website). </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Experimentation</h3>
<p>Thanks to Elizabeth Brennan and Yongji Wang, we tested the effectiveness of using dividers to decrease germ spread in public spaces. <strong>Viruses use air particles </strong>breathed out by humans<strong> as their medium of transmission.</strong> We simulated this event by using <strong>water molecules, a medium that has comparable fluid dynamics</strong>. We placed lego blocks throughout a liquid tank to represent seats in a public space. Yellow liquid, representing someone's breath, was released from a syringe at one of these seats. We found that the yellow liquid spread much faster and farther when no dividers were present as opposed to when dividers were in place. The results indicate that <strong>using dividers decreases the spread of germs</strong> from someone's breath throughout a public space. This also brings us to a grander conclusion that<strong> </strong>breaking airflow can be more important than social distancing. Below are some images from our fluid dynamic simulation of an airplane-like seating arrangement approximately 10 seconds after yellow liquid was released:</p>

<p><strong><u>The Inspiration behind The Chopper by Revolve Electric Bikes</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>July 1969:</u></strong></p>
<p>In July 1969, a movie was released called the “Easy Rider” starring Peter Fonda. That movie introduced the world to the motorcycle known as the Chopper. The Chopper motorcycle is distinctive with it’s trademark type handlebars, wheels and extended frame. The Chopper was created and designed in the 1960’s.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581082276/o8ugm6kgms5wddlkchj6.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong><u>August 2018:</u></strong></p>
<p>Revolve has been a major player in the Electric Bike market since 2010. We are always searching for new designs and upgrading components. August 2018 is when we made a decision to develop The Chopper as an electric bike. We used the unique handlebars- when one sees these handlebars, they immediately say- “it’s a Chopper”. We decided to have two different size tires. One 24” in the rear and a smaller 20” in the front. The tires are 4” wide providing true motorcycle traction. The frame had to be developed to be longer than a traditional bike frame so one can extend their legs. Look how comfortable Peter Fonda looks riding the Chopper. We have designed ours for your riding comfort. Whether your height is 5’2” or 6’7”- one size fits all. Adjust the seat and handlebars and you will look as comfortable as Peter Fonda. Lastly, we added the best quality components to this bike- Bafang motor, Tektro hydraulic brakes and Samsung battery.</p>
<p>Frankly, there is no other electric bike in the market that duplicates this bike in design and quality.  </p>
<p><strong><u>February 2020:</u></strong></p>
<p>Revolve is launching on Indiegogo the opportunity for you to have your own Chopper. For those that take advantage of this opportunity during the 30 days this program is running, they will receive significant discount in price and delivery by May 2020.  Please either sign up so we can update you on the launch date on Indiegogo or send an email to <a href=""mailto:RevolveEbikes27@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RevolveEbikes27@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong><u>History of Revolve Electric Bikes:</u></strong></p>
<p>Revolve began importing electric bikes to both the US and Europe in June 2010. Since that time, we have created over 75 different models, manufactured and sold thousands of bikes. We are based in New York. We have two warehouses (NY and California). This has been our way to satisfy our dealers and consumers anywhere in the US conveniently.</p>
<p>Revolve is a company that was created to sell electric bikes.  All bikes are powered by batteries.  Prior to launching any of our products, management of Revolve devotes extensive time assuring that quality is a priority.  To accomplish this mission, we have visited our suppliers of batteries and bicycles to ascertain that quality is uppermost in their minds-not just ours. Using the best components also is a priority. We have ordered production models from potential manufacturers and subjected the bikes and vehicles to rigorous tests before accepting these manufacturers as suppliers.  Every product comes with a warranty.  Parts such as brakes and wheels which are subjected to normal wear and tear are not covered by warranties.</p>
<p>We do not just create, manufacture and sell bikes. We order and stock spare parts in the warehouses. We carry spare parts for all Revolve EBikes, even for some that are 9 years old. We have a network of dealers we use across the US that will service a Revolve bike, if needed. For the most part, most of the request are for replacement batteries after 3-5 years of use.</p>
<p>We are accessible to you by either email (<a href=""mailto:Revolveebikes27@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Revolveebikes27@gmail.com</a>) or by phone (212-897-7771). We respond to emails or phone calls immediately. Essentially- we are there for you.</p>
<p>We are now asking you to back us on Indiegogo because we are not new or strangers to this industry. You are backing a company that has passed the test of time in selling thousands of bikes to satisfied customers.</p>
<p><strong><u>Product Description:</u></strong></p>
<p>The Chopper is your way to escape. The 750w Bafang motor allows you to cruise at speeds up to 27mph and conquer any hill in your path. The bike is powered by a 48v 14ah Samsung cell battery. You will comfortably travel ranges from 30-50 miles. Our 22amp controller which is waterproof, allows you to ride in all types of weather. The front and rear lights both operate from the battery. Once you turn on your lights, both lights will be illuminated. The LCD display screen, which is multi-colored, tracks your battery level, speed, pedal assist level and distance traveled. The beige comfortable seat comes with matching comfort hand grips.</p>

<p><strong><u>Why should I buy the Chopper?</u></strong></p>
<p>The Chopper was designed to create a comfortable ride, with a powerful motor, long-lasting battery and a unique look. We also discovered that of the limited quantity we sold, many were purchased by former motorcycle riders and the reviews were great.</p>
<p>To create that comfortable ride, most people like to sit straight up without bending. The Chopper type handlebars do just that, plus the handlebars can be adjustable to exactly your desired position. We added a nice large seat and cushy handgrips.</p>
<p>To make it powerful, we are using a 750 Bafang motor with a 22amp waterproof controller. The combination of a motor with a large controller is essential to make sure the power is captured when needed. This combination will allow you to cruise at 27mph and not allowing any hill to be an obstacle. This is one of the best electric motors in the market and in some circles better than Bosch. The Chopper has both throttle and 5 levels of pedal assist.</p>
<p>Since you will be travelling at a good speed, we want to make sure you can stop. The brakes are hydraulic disc made by Tektron.  </p>
<p>The battery is lithium. It has 48volts/14amp hours. The cells are Samsung.</p>
<p>The unique look is obvious. We are using two different size Kenda fat tires. The front is 20” x 4.0 and the rear is 24” x 4.0. The frame is long so the rider can sit up and stretch out their legs. Since 2010, Revolve Electric Bikes has led by design. There is no other company offering this design or quality.</p>
<p>Since Revolve has been around for just about 10 years, we have a network of dealers throughout the country that can service an electric bike. As electric bikes become more popular, more and more dealers will become available.</p>
<p>Aside from the attributes just mentioned, this bike normally sells at dealers for $2,999.00. If you want delivery by May 2020, we are prepared to sell it, including free shipping for $1,499.00. That is a 50% discount- do not hesitate. Go to Indiegogo and back us as soon as you can.</p>

<p>Sophies Angels is a new, female only, personal passenger service which has begun is Wellington New Zealand with our first and only driver, and founder; Sophie Denman.  Our goal is to provide an alternative transport option to female clients who are seeking a safer and more comfortable way to get around. </p>
<p>Sophie has been a driver in the passenger transport industry for over a year and in that time she realised two things:</p>
<p>1 – There are women who do not feel safe, or comfortable, or respected, when taking taxis or their alternatives.  This problem is made worse for young women who want to socialise and go out at night.</p>
<p>2 – Sophie could not earn a living wage working as she was as a full time driver.  Due fuel costs, taxes, insurance and the cost to maintain her own vehicle, and the companies percentage she was effectively paying the company to drive people from place to place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is where Sophies Angels began.  To take Sophie’s own personal experiences and those of her passengers and turn it into a revolution in the transport industry.  A company where the customers feel safe, and the drivers can earn fair pay.  A company that understands why women do not feel safe, and acknowledges it.  Where we strive to remove and reduce the dangers and threats, by first admitting that they are there. </p>
<p>All our vehicles will have live video streaming to our monitoring centre, and this will be recorded so we can investigate complaints, and to deter any misconduct.  Our drivers will all require passenger endorsements and a clean driving record, as well as have the supportive and protective attitude that makes her an Angel.</p>
<p>Our initial goal here is to develop a smart phone App to connect our clients to our drivers, to arrange bookings and to report feedback.  We need a large amount of money to achieve this.  We are asking for NZ$100,000.00 to develop the App and start hiring additional drivers.</p>
<p>If we reach $300,000.00 we will invest in a fleet of vehicles and lease office space for administration and support staff.  We will also plan to approach the New Zealand Police and government as well as local support agencies to provide a free emergency service for women in need.</p>
<p>If we surpass one million dollars in donations we will begin nationwide operations in New Zealand and develop plans to go worldwide.</p>

Answer : We are expecting, with planned gearing and from research, to be above 60 mph but for saftey reasons plan to be under 80 mph stock. As with most anything powered, you can increase that number with modification.   • What customization options do you plan to offer? Answer : We plan to offer  various power plant options, a choice of three body styles and your personal frame color/design, interior color, and wheel  color.  We want to give as many options as we can so each kart can be uniquely you.  •What if I want to use a snow mobile or rotax engine? Answer:  As we grow we plan to offer adapter plates for adding jack shafts and other motor mounts to retro fit an existing kart or be able to order it when ordering the kart new. •Where will these be made? Answer: These will be hand-built in the DFW area of North Texas, U.S.A.  *Disclaimer: These karts are serious adult karts only meant for licensed drivers age 16 or older.    Risks and challengesSome of the challenges we have faced have been to locate the right parts for the scale of the car we are building. It took a few years of research to locate certain parts and the frame images required. At this time, the remaining challenge is a steady supply of power plants of up to four cylinder/four cycle 600cc motors.",4.0,0,"4 Campaigns
