<p><strong><a href=""http://www.bartzbarbecue.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bartz Barbecue</a></strong> is a Texas Style Barbecue Pop-Up located in Los Angeles California. We have been in business since July 2016 and have been doing pop-ups at breweries and festivals all over Los Angeles. Currently we are looking to expand our catering business and have recently acquired a both a new van and a food trailer to help us with the catering business. The new food trailer is coming without any kitchen equipment inside of it. The purpose of this campaign is to help us raise enough money to put in a stove, fryer, refrigerator, steam table, electric food warmer and 20 quart mixer. Below is a diagram of the trailer we are getting built currently. </p>

<p>We have had a huge demand for catering but have not been able to fulfill a lot of the requests because we have been so focused on the popup businesses and also did not have a permanent spot to park our smoker and the new food trailer. We recently have acquired a  spot in Hawthorne, CA that will allow us to have a permanent spot to cook both on our smoker and kitchen trailer.  By helping with the campaign you will help us relieve some of the financial burden that we have undertaken to get this part of the business off the ground. </p>
<p>What we are offering as perks are all our T-shirts, Hats, and Hoodies up for sale. We get a lot of requests for these so here is your chance to purchase one and also help us out get new equipment for this trailer. We are also offering these barbecue and beer dinners. The dinners will take place at<strong> <a href=""http://www.laaleworks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LA Ale Works</a> </strong>in their private room they have. For two hours you can eat all the barbecue and drink all the beers you would like. Any BBQ left over at the end will can be taken home. Since we will be cutting back on the pop-ups in 2020 this will be a great way to eat some food and hang out with us it a more relaxed setting than at a normal pop-up. These events are limited to 20 people. If they sell out we will add additional dates to the campaign. </p>

<p>In addition, we are also offering catering jobs at discounted prices for anyone who help support this campaign. We have several options already listed. If you want a custom catering job that does not fit in the ones listed. Please contact us through the link above and we will add a custom perk for you.  We also are offering to anyone who does a perk $500 or more will get their name engraved on the new food trailer. There is also a perk for $250 that will get your name on the trailer.</p>
<p><strong>For those of you who follow us we did say we are stopping pop-ups after 2019. We know this has disappointed many of you.  To clear this up we will still be doing pop-ups for special events and also will still be doing some pop-ups at LA Ale Works. We should have clarified that we are not going to have a regular pop-up schedule all over town like we had been doing. Therefore, if you support this campaign it will not help end the pop-ups. In fact if we meet or exceed our goal it will be a lot easier for us to do more pop-ups in 2020. </strong></p>

<p>Nutrition has played an important role in my life. From weight struggles topping the scale at 245 pounds, I began to recognize the power of nutrition at an early age and have since transformed my life.</p>
<p>Throughout my journey I encountered another struggle- obtaining an adequate amount of protein from convenient foods while always on the go. I was sick of mixing protein shakes in water bottles. I wanted to enjoy the taste of my favorite foods with the protein content I desired!</p>
<p>With over 10 years in the consumer packaged good industry, I  have gained the knowledge and experience allowing me to take action.  I decided to create the solution to a problem that many of us face on a daily basis while simultaneously impacting the world!</p>

Our goal is to raise $40,000.  20% or more of funds raised will be donated to help charity: water provide clean, safe drinking water to people in need.  The remaining funds raised will go towards our first production run which will enable TOPBiT to come to market and continually donate 10% of our profits to work towards closing the gap of those living without clean water.
Together, we will make a difference!

 




 

Tim Galligan

Nutrition has played an important role in my life. From weight struggles topping the scale at 245 pounds, I began to recognize the power of nutrition at an early age and have since transformed my life.
Throughout my journey I encountered another struggle- obtaining an adequate amount of protein from convenient foods while always on the go. I was sick of mixing protein shakes in water bottles. I wanted to enjoy the taste of my favorite foods with the protein content I desired!
With over 10 years in the consumer packaged good industry, I  have gained the knowledge and experience allowing me to take action.  I decided to create the solution to a problem that many of us face on a daily basis while simultaneously impacting the world!

Founded in 2014, Grey Matter Distillery is Jacksonville’s First Craft Distillery and a cornerstone of Jacksonville's craft spirt marketplace.  We started Carve Craft Vodka with the goal of producing a high quality spirit here in Jacksonville, our home and community.  When we opened our doors we were not able to have tastings or real direct customer interaction.   In addition, our starting budget was much less than other distilleries.  By operating on a slim budget and doing everything ourselves, we were able to get a space that fit our needs and get our product on the shelf.  We did this in a small, 1800 Sq-ft warehouse in Arlington.  Our goal has always been to move to a retail friendly area, grow our product line, and be a part of the local community.  Our new Headquarters will provide a customer facing, community driven experience fully capable of tours, tastings, and other special events which provide value to the surrounding areas.  

What We Need & What You Get
We need funding to facilitate our move and do a killer build-out/Experience for our loyal customers:

Moving a distillery is quite the undertaking.  We already have the equipment and materials needed, but logistics and overall expense of a new facility buildout are steep.  We will need new electricians, plumbers, architects to name a few, which will help us get from point A to point B.
With your support, we will finally achieve the distillery experience our supportive Jacksonville community deserves.  We are extremely excited for the opportunity to better serve the community we love.
The initial funds will go towards producing and barreling Single Barrel Live Oak Whiskey.  The rest will go towards the build-out of Grey Matter Distillery 2.0.


The Impact
The new location will give us the ability to expand and offer new products that we did not have the ability to do before:

Making great products locally has always been our goal.  This new location will give us the ability to do more and bring more local success to the Jacksonville Community
With our small footprint we have been able to grow our brand already.  We have worked with dozens of local charities and this venue will give us the ability and do more to support them and our community.


Risks & Challenges
Let's be real...This will be difficult, and likely our biggest challenge to date.  We are ready.  This has been 6 years in the making, and it is time to deliver the experience you deserve. 

We run our business with a low overhead and do things fiscally responsible.  With help from our friends and community, we will have a fully operational and customer friendly distillery by 2021.
The first time around it took a while to get the city on board to support us.  This time is different.  We have already been in talks with the city and they are excited to ge this project to fruition.

They can not replace your daily intake of specific drugs, vitamins, and food.<br/><br/>3. <strong><i>What happens if I eat a Tea Bonbon? </i></strong><br/>Congratulations! You are not alone, and we tried! As long as you do not get choked, you will digest the Tea Bonbon.<br/><br/>4. <strong><i>Can I drink Tea Bonbons iced in the summer time?</i></strong><br/>You can add ice-cubes to refresh your teas or cold brew your tea following our instructions “How to Play.” Drinking hot tea in summer is not a risk for your health either.<br/><br/>5. <strong><i>Is the Tea Bonbon organic?</i></strong><br/>At this stage, the Tea Bonbons are not organic (since 100% organic flowers are rare!). Our goal is to become organic first by sourcing and testing organic raw material, and then further control our quality by planting in our fields all the necessary ingredients we need for crafting each Tea Bonbon in our organic tea farm!<br/><br/>6.<i><strong> Where does the Tea inside Tea Bonbon come from?</strong></i><br/>They are mostly from the region of Pu’erh, in Yunnan Province, China. Yunnan is worldwide famous among the tea connoisseurs for having the best quality teas in the world!<br/><br/>7. <strong><i>Do Tea Bonbons contain caffeine?</i></strong><br/>Different type of tea contains different amount of caffeine. Brainstorming has the most amount of caffeine, and sweet home has the least amount because of the fermentation process of its tea base, Puer. In general, whole-leaf teas also release less amount of caffeine because of its smaller contact with water. <br/><br/>8. <strong><i>Can pregnant and breastfeeding women drink Tea Bonbons?</i></strong><br/>Just as coffee, tea intake should be reduced during pregnancy and breastfeeding stage. Good Morning Bonbon should be taken with extra caution because of the mint in the recipe. </p><p><br/>9. <strong><i>Is the Tea Bonbon becoming bitter after some time in a cup?</i></strong><br/> No. We crafted our Tea Bonbons thinking with our customer’s habits. We know you may forget to take the tea out of the mug. Therefore we balanced the ingredients of each receipt to avoid astringency and bitterness.<br/><br/>10. <strong><i>Can I put the Tea Bonbon inside a bag filter or metal filter?</i></strong><br/>Definitely yes. You can also chew and eat the tea leaves and flowers if they flow to your mouth.<br/><br/>11. <strong><i>Are you going to have more set-ups in the future?</i></strong><br/>Definitely yes. This is our beginning; we are currently working on new recipe tailoring to yoga and so on. Coming soon!<br/><br/> </p><p><u>Tea Plantation related: </u><br/><br/>1.<i><strong> How does an organic farm look like and its difference from ordinary tea farms?</strong></i><br/>On the process, we are glad to send you more pictures and videos of our farm if you write us an email at <u>info@teaplays.com</u>. You will get a real enriching experience visiting it in person if you click on our last perk!

Blended teas, my personal favorite, however, mostly are with artificial fragrances, which look and smell amazing when open, but taste very plain after steeping. China has a rich heritage of tea, and now produces close to 40% of the world’s consumption. Although we have high quality teas of great varieties, most of China’s current tea exports are of the lowest grade! Our mission is to bring China’s high-quality tea to the forefront, with our breadth of knowledge of how teas and herbs work by making tea drinking fun, convenient, and sharable.Concept of Tea Plays:
Health: Effective herbal recipes tailored to different occasions of a day.
Fun: A candy-like treat, for you or for sharing with others as a gift.
Purpose: Make a healthy impact by bringing the best quality tea and herbal knowledge to the rest of the world and in return, being able to nourish the very last link of the whole value chain, the tea farmers.
   Good Morning: Refreshment 
Dianhong black tea from the Yunnan area of China: selected black tea with honey aroma which is the best breakfast drink. You can add half amount of milk to the blend to enhance the rich and silky taste of your tea.
Mint: the best morning tea ingredient for its invigorating aromas, as well as its herbal function of easing queasy stomachs, calming anxiety and helping keep focused.
Calendula: a flower of the family of daisies which is traditionally used for radiation therapy and anti-inflammation treatment of skin and throat. It helps to detox for a fresh start.
 Brainstorming: Energizer 
Dancong Oolong tea from the Fenghuang Mountain in Canton province, China: a partially-fermented tea from camellia sinensis plant which has the aroma of orchid. It contains caffeine and theophylline and is used to sharpen thinking skills and improve mental alertness.
Ginseng: Containing anticancer substances, it is a traditional remedy for improving thinking ability and cognition and boosting energy, when taken in a long-run. 
Licorice Roots: The natural sweetness of licorice roots helps create a positive energy to cope with your complex work, be it at the office or during a busy day of classes. 
 After Lunch: Digestive
Raw Puer tea from the Yunnan area of China: an exquisite tea type for top tea lovers for its fresh smell and the sweet aftertaste. It is commonly used for weight loss, keeping a nice figure, or lowering your blood pressure.
Hawthorn: a household digestive assistants helping you ease yourself back into work after your meal.
Jasmine flower: freshens up your mouth breath after your lunch.
 Sweet Home: Calming
Fermented Puer tea from the Yunnan area of China: reddish-brown in color, it has an earthy smell, and very mellow taste and silky-smooth texture
Rose buds: apart from known as a powerful antioxidant herb, rose also has great calming effect on the nervous system providing relief from anxiety and stress. Its intake aids in preventing and treating symptoms of depressive disorders such as persistent feelings of sadness and hopelessness, loss of interest, irritability, and insomnia.

How many Tea Bonbons can I drink per day?The carefully crafted four bonbon set-ups are safe to drink during a day. 2. Can Tea Bonbons replace my medication and vitamins intake?Tea Bonbons have wellness effects, but they are not therapeutic. They can not replace your daily intake of specific drugs, vitamins, and food.3. What happens if I eat a Tea Bonbon? Congratulations! You are not alone, and we tried! As long as you do not get choked, you will digest the Tea Bonbon.4. Can I drink Tea Bonbons iced in the summer time?You can add ice-cubes to refresh your teas or cold brew your tea following our instructions “How to Play.” Drinking hot tea in summer is not a risk for your health either.5. Is the Tea Bonbon organic?At this stage, the Tea Bonbons are not organic (since 100% organic flowers are rare!). Our goal is to become organic first by sourcing and testing organic raw material, and then further control our quality by planting in our fields all the necessary ingredients we need for crafting each Tea Bonbon in our organic tea farm!6. Where does the Tea inside Tea Bonbon come from?They are mostly from the region of Pu’erh, in Yunnan Province, China. Yunnan is worldwide famous among the tea connoisseurs for having the best quality teas in the world!7. Do Tea Bonbons contain caffeine?Different type of tea contains different amount of caffeine. Brainstorming has the most amount of caffeine, and sweet home has the least amount because of the fermentation process of its tea base, Puer. In general, whole-leaf teas also release less amount of caffeine because of its smaller contact with water. 8. Can pregnant and breastfeeding women drink Tea Bonbons?Just as coffee, tea intake should be reduced during pregnancy and breastfeeding stage. Good Morning Bonbon should be taken with extra caution because of the mint in the recipe. 9. Is the Tea Bonbon becoming bitter after some time in a cup? No. We crafted our Tea Bonbons thinking with our customer’s habits. We know you may forget to take the tea out of the mug. Therefore we balanced the ingredients of each receipt to avoid astringency and bitterness.10. Can I put the Tea Bonbon inside a bag filter or metal filter?Definitely yes. You can also chew and eat the tea leaves and flowers if they flow to your mouth.11. Are you going to have more set-ups in the future?Definitely yes. This is our beginning; we are currently working on new recipe tailoring to yoga and so on. Coming soon! Tea Plantation related: 1. How does an organic farm look like and its difference from ordinary tea farms?On the process, we are glad to send you more pictures and videos of our farm if you write us an email at info@teaplays.com.

We will take you to our farms and show how the everyday life of the tea farmers is, the authentic Chinese tea culture, and the fascinating modern management of an organic tea plantation in the combination of rich tea-making tradition and heritage. 2. How are the tea farmers compensated?The farmers receive a fixed income + a variable depending on the amount of fresh tea leaves and their equivalent quality that they pick and summon. To avoid applying pesticides to the trees, our farm adopted the innovative approach, paying a bonus to the farmers who manually catch worms ($0.003/worm), and to whom bringing insects to the laboratory for analysis. With this method, we have a preventive system to avoid insect plagues.  3. How is your tea farm organized? The entire organic tea farm (300 hectares) is split into two parts, each part having a manager and a team of farmers. The farmers live in the tea mountain, so is the school where their children go to during the day. There are different regular learning and recreation activities to encourage them and other family members to have a stable and fulfilled life, e.g., Fridays tea tasting, Saturdays night school, and monthly Birthday parties, etc. If you feel like participating in any of these activities (e.g., Summer English or reading training to the children during summer holiday), do not hesitate to contact us!",32.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Bread &amp; Butter Oakland will be a unique and much needed addition to Oakland's Pill Hill neighborhood!  There are no other plant-based cafes within walking distance to the growing residential and office units nearby.  We will highlight fresh local ingredients in every dish (offering support to many other small businesses and farms) while also being mindful of the convenience factor that is necessary during a busy work day.  Like many buildings in Pill Hill, the one that houses our cafe dates back to the 1920's.  The area has a rich history in providing medical care to its residents.  Just as the neighborhood is undergoing a renaissance, we believe Oakland's food offerings should reflect the growing need for fresh, nutritious, and environmentally conscious eating options.  Bread &amp; Butter is committed to making delicious, nostalgic, and creative food from a plant-centered perspective, providing low environmental impact disposables, and incentives for using reusable serve ware. We will also offer a lower cost community meal option each day to provide greater accessibility to more patrons. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We realize that there are risks involved in opening a cafe.  As with most businesses, it is not a sure thing.  Yet with Alicia's years of culinary experience and community following and Sheila's enthusiasm, commitment and determination, we feel confident that we will succeed despite challenges along the way.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that giving financially might not fit into your life at this time. But, you can still be part of the Bread &amp; Butter community. Please share this campaign far and wide!! Send it to your friends and family via email, share it on Facebook and Instagram (it’s easy to do with the linked icons), talk about us to everyone who will listen! Help us create a wonderful space to gather, connect, and enjoy a delicious meal. </p>

<h3>The Porta Presso: The first truly portable espresso machine.</h3>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510791269/ql3tzviga4jbm0nuoswd.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Available now at <a href=""https://theportapresso.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ThePortaPresso.com</a></strong></h3>
<p>While you appreciate good coffee, you don’t have the resources to hand-craft the perfect espresso coffee anytime, anywhere. So we created The Porta Presso to give you a barista experience wherever you are.</p>
<p>Traditionally it’s the job of a barista to accurately brew any given bean into that perfect cup of espresso coffee. However, The Porta Presso has been designed to brew coffee in a specific, precise and consistent way anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>The world’s first portable lithium battery operated espresso machine that is able to grind beans, boil water, extract coffee and heat/froth milk all seamlessly in a compact state of the art device.</p>
<p><u>All orders include free worldwide shipping.</u></p>
<p>View updates of The Prota Presso development <a href=""https://theportapresso.com/updates"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>here</strong></a></p>
<h3>THE DESIGN</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510794594/xpasrvr1expjyzmn2if4.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Porta Presso has already undergone an intense design phase to get to the near perfect design that it is today. With its sleek form guided by its functional parts. It will have carefully honed mechanisms combined with smart technologies in a coffee maker that is sleek, stylish and minimalistic. Each aspect of The Porta Presso has been carefully designed to ensure that it is truly portable whilst maintaining a high quality of coffee by making The Porta Presso lightweight, compact and a practical addition to any situation.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510794715/lalbeqnezeb4bqsgjniu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
<ol>
<li>Fill The Porta Presso with fresh beans, tap water and milk (optional) at the start of your day or trip into the appropriate clearly labelled slots. The Porta Presso will hold enough milk, water and coffee beans to make a cup of coffee. The milk and water level will be physically visible.</li>
<li>When you are ready to brew, twist the planetary grinder 3 times to grind your fresh beans and twist the dial 90° to compact your grinds. </li>
<li>Turn The Porta Presso on, you will then choose your type of coffee via the built-in LCD screen on downloadable smart device app and The Porta Presso will do the magic for you, boiling the water to the required extraction temperature of 98°, applying the optimal pressure of 17 bar the coffee will be reluctant to pour for the first 9 seconds to ensure a rich flavour. </li>
<li>The total pour time will be approximately 27 seconds before the milk that has been heated to 65° (unless customized by the user) is added and the appropriate amount of froth achieved.</li>
</ol>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510791329/zzextpa2jqpptolz7juq.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>

<h3>FUNCTIONAL PARTS</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510791524/iajo78evxe06cszqeaf3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>GRINDING/COMPACTING</strong></p>
<p>The grinding and compacting of the beans will be an important stage to ensure you get a high-quality barista tasting coffee. Why is that? If the beans are not finely ground or properly compacted, the resulting coffee will be weak. On the other hand, if the beans are ground too fine or compacted too tight then when the water passing through to make the shot will take too long to pass through the grind thus resulting in a terribly tasting burnt coffee.</p>
<p>That is why after extensive research and testing The Porta Presso will come preset on the optimal settings for that perfect grind and compacting. And for you coffee experts, The Porta Presso will have the option to change your settings to your preference if you prefer a slightly different setting.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510791389/shknsgelyuslmpmmm9yc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>How will The Porta Presso grind and compact the beans?  The Porta Presso has a built-in planetary geared grinder and compactor which is easy to use yet effective. The planetary grinding system will hold up to 57g of coffee beans (3 coffees worth). The grinder will effectively grind at a 1:5 twist ratio simply meaning you only need to twist the grinder 3 times either way to grind the perfect amount of 19g of coffee grinds. The compactor will be integrated into the grinder and requires the user to simply twist the top 90º. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510918743/vrwkvubgfp6wepbprklq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>LCD SCREEN</strong></p>
<p>The Porta Presso will feature a 30x55mm built in LCD screen which serves an array of purposes. The LCD screen allows the user to refine their coffee so that its just how they like it with the option to simply use the pre set coffee settings. Users will have full control over the temperature, strength and amount of froth so that each person’s coffee can be personalised to their liking. With the option to adjust a pre-set coffee or start from scratch and fully customise your own coffee and save it so that The Porta Presso will remember your settings for next time. </p>
<p>The Porao Presso’s LCD screen can also be used to show the time remaining on a brew once it has commenced so that you know when your coffee's ready. It also shows battery life and remaining CO2, alerting you when either is running low.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>DRINKING CUP</strong></p>
<p>The Porta Presso Cup has been intuitively designed so that it is sleek and minimal, yet it fits into a standard cup holder. The Porta Presso cups come in an assortment of colours so that you can get the cup that is right for you. The cup is able to be seamlessly attached and detached from The Porta Presso machine, curating a whole new user experience.</p>

<p><strong>REPLENISHING BEANS &amp; C02</strong></p>
<p>To make The Porta Presso even more easy for coffee drinkers, you will be able to conveniently order fresh bean sachets and/or CO2 canisters from The Porta Presso app or website.  They can be delivered to your doorstep at the touch of a button.  Choose from a one-off delivery or a subscription.  Alternatively, use your own!</p>

<p>We are a young couple (18 and 20) from Auckland, New Zealand with a love of coffee!  Having both worked as baristas in the past we saw the opportunity to create something that had never been done before.   </p>
<p>Our love for coffee led us to searching the global marketplace for an espresso coffee machine that could make a great tasting coffee and was entirely portable. After discovering that there was no existing product that could grind/compact beans, boil water and heat/froth milk the idea for The Porta Presso was born.With an ever-growing demand for coffee, we envision The Porta Presso as something that will make a practical addition to any situation. For the past year, we have teamed up with and worked alongside leading New Zealand product design company Global Design Production to turn our concept into a reality.  We appreciate any help and support we can get on this journey!  </p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><strong>WHY C02?</strong></p>
<p>After extensive research and careful consideration, we decided to opt for the C02 canister concept over a mini water pump that we had also designed. This is because the C02 canister allows The Porto Presso to be able to function with a smaller battery and thus have a sleek, stylish and minimalistic appeal on the go whilst having all of the functionalities of a traditional espresso coffee machine, allowing it to be easily portable. Each canister will be able to make at least 15 coffees and has been designed to be extreamly user friendly to replace. You will easily be able to buy extra canisters from your local shops or via The Porta Presso's website to get them delivered to your door.</p>
<p><strong>WHY BEANS?</strong></p>
<p>A coffee isn’t a coffee without the authentic taste of freshly ground beans. We envisioned that The Porta Presso would create a coffee that is as authentic as the coffee you would get from your local barista. Nobody likes the unauthentic taste of coffee capsules and pre-ground, dry beans. However should you find yourself without any fresh beans, The Porta Presso will still allow you to use pre-ground beans.</p>
<p><strong>Is the Porta Presso easy to clean?</strong></p>
<p>All the parts you will need to clean will be 100% removable and dishwasher safe - the grind waste compartment, the milk container and the water container - the grinder is also able to be washed. Simply throw them in the dishwasher for a good cleaning if you're done with your Porta Presso for the day. If you're wanting to make another cup of coffee simply dispose of the used grinds and attach the clean cup or simply rinse out the already used cup and you're good to go again.</p>
<p><strong>Is international shipping free?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, international shipping is free for all perks. </p>
<p><strong>What does the PortaPresso include?</strong></p>
<p>All Porta Presso's include The Porta Presso, a charger, manual, 1 cup, and 2 CO2 canisters to get you started.</p>
<p><b>Where can I buy CO2 canisters?</b></p>
<p>You can purchase these from most cycling stores, our website and/or subscription service and inevitably in most major supermarket chains.</p>

<h3><strong>STRETCH GOALS</strong></h3>
<p><strong>$150,000 - CHARGING DOCK</strong></p>
<p>The Porta Presso charges with a standard micro USB charging cord which is common among devices with the option to plug it into a wall socket, a car cigarette lighter or any other USB supported charging devices.</p>
<p>Our stretched goal is to make a wireless charging dock that will allow you to simply place your Porta Presso onto it at the end of the day and simply pick it back up again when you are ready to use it.  If we reach this stretch goal, everyone who pledged towards a Porta Presso will also receive a wireless charging dock.</p>

Available now at www.ThePortaPresso.com
While you appreciate good coffee, you don’t have the resources to hand-craft the perfect espresso coffee anytime, anywhere. So we created The Porta Presso to give you a barista experience wherever you are.
Traditionally it’s the job of a barista to accurately brew any given bean into that perfect cup of espresso coffee. However, The Porta Presso has been designed to brew coffee in a specific, precise and consistent way anytime, anywhere.
The world’s first portable lithium battery operated espresso machine that is able to grind beans, boil water, extract coffee and heat/froth milk all seamlessly in a compact state of the art device.
All orders include free worldwide shipping.

THE DESIGN

The Porta Presso has already undergone an intense design phase to get to the near perfect design that it is today. With its sleek form guided by its functional parts. It will have carefully honed mechanisms combined with smart technologies in a coffee maker that is sleek, stylish and minimalistic. Each aspect of The Porta Presso has been carefully designed to ensure that it is truly portable whilst maintaining a high quality of coffee by making The Porta Presso lightweight, compact and a practical addition to any situation.

HOW IT WORKS

Fill The Porta Presso with fresh beans, tap water and milk (optional) at the start of your day or trip into the appropriate clearly labelled slots. The Porta Presso will hold enough milk, water and coffee beans to make a cup of coffee. The milk and water level will be physically visible.
When you are ready to brew, twist the planetary grinder 3 times to grind your fresh beans and twist the dial 90° to compact your grinds. 
Turn The Porta Presso on, you will then choose your type of coffee via the built-in LCD screen on downloadable smart device app and The Porta Presso will do the magic for you, boiling the water to the required extraction temperature of 98°, applying the optimal pressure of 17 bar the coffee will be reluctant to pour for the first 9 seconds to ensure a rich flavour. 
The total pour time will be approximately 27 seconds before the milk that has been heated to 65° (unless customized by the user) is added and the appropriate amount of froth achieved.


 
FUNCTIONAL PARTS

GRINDING/COMPACTING
The grinding and compacting of the beans will be an important stage to ensure you get a high-quality barista tasting coffee. Why is that? If the beans are not finely ground or properly compacted, the resulting coffee will be weak. On the other hand, if the beans are ground too fine or compacted too tight then when the water passing through to make the shot will take too long to pass through the grind thus resulting in a terribly tasting burnt coffee.
That is why after extensive research and testing The Porta Presso will come preset on the optimal settings for that perfect grind and compacting. And for you coffee experts, The Porta Presso will have the option to change your settings to your preference if you prefer a slightly different setting.

How will The Porta Presso grind and compact the beans?  The Porta Presso has a built-in planetary geared grinder and compactor which is easy to use yet effective. The planetary grinding system will hold up to 57g of coffee beans (3 coffees worth). The grinder will effectively grind at a 1:5 twist ratio simply meaning you only need to twist the grinder 3 times either way to grind the perfect amount of 19g of coffee grinds. The compactor will be integrated into the grinder and requires the user to simply twist the top 90º. 

LCD SCREEN
The Porta Presso will feature a 30x55mm built in LCD screen which serves an array of purposes. The LCD screen allows the user to refine their coffee so that its just how they like it with the option to simply use the pre set coffee settings. Users will have full control over the temperature, strength and amount of froth so that each person’s coffee can be personalised to their liking. With the option to adjust a pre-set coffee or start from scratch and fully customise your own coffee and save it so that The Porta Presso will remember your settings for next time. 
The Porao Presso’s LCD screen can also be used to show the time remaining on a brew once it has commenced so that you know when your coffee's ready. It also shows battery life and remaining CO2, alerting you when either is running low.

 
DRINKING CUP
The Porta Presso Cup has been intuitively designed so that it is sleek and minimal, yet it fits into a standard cup holder. The Porta Presso cups come in an assortment of colours so that you can get the cup that is right for you. The cup is able to be seamlessly attached and detached from The Porta Presso machine, curating a whole new user experience.


REPLENISHING BEANS & C02
To make The Porta Presso even more easy for coffee drinkers, you will be able to conveniently order fresh bean sachets and/or CO2 canisters from The Porta Presso app or website.  They can be delivered to your doorstep at the touch of a button.  Choose from a one-off delivery or a subscription.  Alternatively, use your own!

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>Thank you for checking out our Mug Club pre-sale.  Who is Artifice Ales &amp;  Mead?  We are your neighbors, we live here in Manheim.  We are starting this project in Manheim to build a legacy and sink our roots deeper into the community. Time and time again we hear from folks how this community is ready for something big to come here.  We couldn't agree more!  We really hope this is what you had in mind.</p>
<p>Our experience: We are the owners and operators of Meduseld Meadery in Lancaster.  Meduseld has grown in the three years that we've been operating, and we are bursting at the seams with our production space.  Renovating the old Bickels Chip factory at the REO Manheim Marketplace into a brewery/restaurant is going to give us the space we need to expand our Mead production and branch out into brewing Beer.  We are also going to be a full service restaurant that is focusing on being a Gastropub.  A Gastropub is a style of restaurant that focuses on Food and Beverage pairings.</p>
<p>We're not using the typical fund raising format.  We want to offer our Mug Club Membership so folks who've been following our progress can get the jump on it and not miss out if they can't get to us right away when we open.  Additionally, we feel that offering Axe Throwing Memberships (and tiers that combine both) will help strengthen the bonds between us and the community we're trying to foster at Artifice.  We will use the extra funds to support two different aspects of our business that will provide our community with more goods and services...an initial lot of barrel cooperage for aging special Beer and Mead, and finishing our Axe Throwing Range/Event Space.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why are we doing pre-sales?</h3>
<p>We are launching this campaign to build awareness to our upcoming opening late in 2020.  The more Memberships we pre-sell means we'll be able to finish our covered patio, which will house our Axe Throwing/Event Venue...which will give us additional capabilities we want to offer our community. </p>
<p>The Event Venue is an out-building addition that will house our Axe Throwing Ranges and possibly a second bar.  It will be rent-able space for our community and local businesses to use for their gatherings, as well as a separate but connected area to enjoy the Sport of Axe Throwing during our regular hours.  </p>
<p>The budget we have now is sufficient to cover the costs of construction and purchase our equipment and furnishings...so either way we will be enjoying a pint together over a plate of excellent food!   </p>
<p>This is what we need in order to enhance your experience with us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addition Finishes will require $45,000...we need half of that to get started.  This covers finishing the structure with garage doors on both of the open sides, a bar, and more furnishings, as well as a second range.</li>
<li>Left over funds will go directly into purchasing barrels for aging our products.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The impact of your purchase:</h3>
<p>If we don't reach our funding goal it will restrict our capabilities initially.  We are almost finished building this Gastropub, so regardless of the results of this campaign we're due to open in April.  We thought we would offer some of our memberships ahead of time, and build some excitement around our project.  We can't wait to strengthen our ties to the local community and build a community hub!  </p>
<p>Some perk Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mug Club members will get an exclusive branded mug and a FREE beer on scheduled Membership days, plus other perks.</li>
<li>Axe Throwing enthusiasts will get a lot of mileage out of their throwing passes.</li>
<li>Pro Tip: Pick the tier you want that supports your future involvement with us...some include rare bottle release privileges for the die hard beer enthusiast.</li>
<li>These perks make great gifts for your hard to shop for family members! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Some of the Risks to our project...the aftermath 2020, Covid-19...by now we don't have to tell you that the restaurant industry has taken a huge hit.  We had these plans in motion from the beginning of the year, and we're sticking to them.  If we didn't believe in our ability to execute, or the ability of our community to show us support, you wouldn't be reading this.  We're going to get through the other side of this stronger together, but we could use your support to make this even better!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, or maybe you don't want a membership? Here is how you can still help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.</li>
<li>Like, Share, Follow and comment on our Social Media pages.</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>

Our experience: We are the owners and operators of Meduseld Meadery in Lancaster.  Meduseld has grown in the three years that we've been operating, and we are bursting at the seams with our production space.  Renovating the old Bickels Chip factory at the REO Manheim Marketplace into a brewery/restaurant is going to give us the space we need to expand our Mead production and branch out into brewing Beer.  We are also going to be a full service restaurant that is focusing on being a Gastropub.  A Gastropub is a style of restaurant that focuses on Food and Beverage pairings.
We're not using the typical fund raising format.  We want to offer our Mug Club Membership so folks who've been following our progress can get the jump on it and not miss out if they can't get to us right away when we open.  Additionally, we feel that offering Axe Throwing Memberships (and tiers that combine both) will help strengthen the bonds between us and the community we're trying to foster at Artifice.  We will use the extra funds to support two different aspects of our business that will provide our community with more goods and services...an initial lot of barrel cooperage for aging special Beer and Mead, and finishing our Axe Throwing Range/Event Space.   

Why are we doing pre-sales?
We are launching this campaign to build awareness to our upcoming opening late in 2020.  The more Memberships we pre-sell means we'll be able to finish our covered patio, which will house our Axe Throwing/Event Venue...which will give us additional capabilities we want to offer our community. 
The Event Venue is an out-building addition that will house our Axe Throwing Ranges and possibly a second bar.  It will be rent-able space for our community and local businesses to use for their gatherings, as well as a separate but connected area to enjoy the Sport of Axe Throwing during our regular hours.  
The budget we have now is sufficient to cover the costs of construction and purchase our equipment and furnishings...so either way we will be enjoying a pint together over a plate of excellent food!   
This is what we need in order to enhance your experience with us:

Addition Finishes will require $45,000...we need half of that to get started.  This covers finishing the structure with garage doors on both of the open sides, a bar, and more furnishings, as well as a second range.
Left over funds will go directly into purchasing barrels for aging our products.


The impact of your purchase:
If we don't reach our funding goal it will restrict our capabilities initially.  We are almost finished building this Gastropub, so regardless of the results of this campaign we're due to open in April.  We thought we would offer some of our memberships ahead of time, and build some excitement around our project.  We can't wait to strengthen our ties to the local community and build a community hub!  
Some perk Highlights:

Mug Club members will get an exclusive branded mug and a FREE beer on scheduled Membership days, plus other perks.
Axe Throwing enthusiasts will get a lot of mileage out of their throwing passes.
Pro Tip: Pick the tier you want that supports your future involvement with us...some include rare bottle release privileges for the die hard beer enthusiast.
These perks make great gifts for your hard to shop for family members! 


Risks & Challenges
Some of the Risks to our project...the aftermath 2020, Covid-19...by now we don't have to tell you that the restaurant industry has taken a huge hit.  We had these plans in motion from the beginning of the year, and we're sticking to them.  If we didn't believe in our ability to execute, or the ability of our community to show us support, you wouldn't be reading this.  We're going to get through the other side of this stronger together, but we could use your support to make this even better!

<h2>Our mission</h2>
<p>is to <strong>catalyze change in environmental conservation, women’s empowerment, and agricultural productivity by adding value to traditional farming systems and connecting our specialty products to high-value gourmet food markets.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Business Summary </h2>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Subsistence farmers in Guatemala struggle to feed their family. Crop yields are very low and market prices are even lower, resulting in malnutrition and poverty across Guatemala (<a href=""http://www.avivara.org/aboutguatemala/povertyinguatemala.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">1</a>) . Approximately half of Guatemala's population is malnourished (<a href=""https://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/global-health/nutrition/countries/guatemala-nutrition-profile"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2</a>), and the rate is even higher among indigenous children as 8 out of 10 children suffer from malnutrition (<a href=""https://www.unicef.org/guatemala/english/overview_18012.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">3</a>). </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>EarthEmpower provides resources for women farmers to sustain their traditional production to feed their families and communities.

<h2>Why Invest In Us </h2>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Economic opportunities, as well as food security and nutrition for rural populations, are urgently needed.  We also consider that social justice and equality at an international level is tied closely to a history of the interrelated economies and politics of Latin America and the United States. Years of top-down development approaches and exploiting export agriculture has resulted in little economic advancement and often worsening family nutrition. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">To find real solutions to these real problems, we must include the people who are most affected and ensure they have a voice in their own development.  Women farmers must be leaders in our organization to see real change. We must no long except status quo. Innovative and alternative pathways towards impact are necessary. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We are leaders and we gave up on the status quo long ago.  <strong>We believe in real change and that is why we work in different ways.</strong></p>

We are a three-man homebrewing company from Sonoma County, California. We have been hard at work, brewing and developing our business model for over 7 years, and we feel ready to share our craft with the world! We are planning to move into the market as a nano/micro-brewery with a taproom and occasional food service. We will serve other local beers until we are properly licensed.

<p>We eventually see a Bug Wagon brick and mortar edible insect outlet in several major metropolitan areas in America (NYC, L.A., Chicago, Dallas etc.), specializing in all things edible insects; also holding regular Bug &amp; Booze pairings, outreaches at local youth &amp; civic groups, schools, and events at select local restaurants and popular nightspots.</p>
<p>We see multiple Bug Wagons eventually roaming various sections of the country on designated routes; pulling into fairs, festivals, expos, wine rooms, beer houses, select restaurants, local nightspots, youth &amp; civic groups, and schools.</p>
<p>Oh, and a parade or two once in a while.</p>
<p>We see an edible insect educational extravaganza with dynamic crowd presentations, fun bug &amp; booze nightspot events, digital media, online marketing, and an ever-increasing demand for edible insects. All while our beautifully decorated unique Bug Wagons travel past tens of millions of motorists on the highways and byways of our routes.</p>
<p>This is only a part of the entire vision.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Adventurous Journey!</h3>
<p>We will travel the highways and byways of the United States, bringing the joy of bugs to all of our appearances. From bullwhip demonstrations to scorpion shot nights; from taste tests to cooking demonstrations; or from the local elementary school to the largest fairs and festivals in the country.</p>
<p>The Bug Wagon pop-up extravaganzamart will be overflowing with edible insects and ready to not only show the world all of the benefits that bug protein delivers to the human body, but also all the benefits of bug farming to the environment, and all of the benefits of bugs as feed, medicine, and fertilizer, as well.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Benefits of Bugs to People and Planet</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>""Bugs. Planet Friendly Protein.""</strong></p>
<p>Edible insects use much less water and land, and produce much less methane than traditional protein sources like beef, pork, or poultry, yet are equally as healthy, and in some cases, actually healthier. They are definitely better for both people <i>and</i> the planet, as our ever-dwindling resources are having a very hard time keeping up with our ever-increasing population. The United Nations says that by 2050, we are going to have a problem trying to feed the world unless we do something now because of the resource drain.</p>

<p>We believe edible insects are a part of the answer. We're not asking people to completely replace their normal protein sources with edible insects, but if everyone set aside just one or two days per month to enjoy a delicious bug-based dish, the impact would be enormous.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What We Need</strong></h2>
<p>Our vision is big, deep, and wide, and we eventually want to cover the Earth. But we have to start somewhere. All visions have a beginning, and ours begins with one van, one pop-up tent (fully stocked), and our Maiden Voyage tour (October/November 2019).</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our First Van (of many)</h3>
<p>We already have a van, a used Plymouth Voyager (the picture is an artist's concept, but the finished version will appear very similar) that needs some mechanical work.

There will also be administrative costs of licensing, insurance, etc.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Pop-Up Tent</h3>
<p>We also need to purchase a 10'x10' festival pop-up canopy with a back wall, custom printing, all display fixtures and other little pop-up store necessities, and cover things like payment services, inspection and licensing fees, and other costs.  Stocking the tent with goods will be a breeze.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">About Cricket Man's Bug Wagon Vision</h3>
<p>Long ago I was a cook in the Coast Guard. I went through the USCG's (then-called) Subsistence Specialist school in Petaluma, which utilized the Culinary Institute of America's curriculum for institutional cooking. I was a state certified child day care administrator for over 10 years, farmed crickets for local pet stores for over 10 years, and in 2017 I started the <i>Ento Nation</i> podcast and infozine which now has reader/listeners in over 200 countries.</p>
<p>I am a bug lover.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564272097/cvzki9fyazgf0bizotmr.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>“Cricket Man is the undisputed </i></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>voice of the edible insect industry.”</i></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><strong><i>-David George Gordon (aka The Bug Chef), author, The Eat-a-Bug Cookbook</i></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the last two years I have come to know scores of people involved with bugs, from CEO's of edible insect companies, bug cooking experts, and food manufacturers, to entomologists, entomological thought leaders, and bug farmers from all over the world. People have been listening to and clicking on <i>Ento Nation</i> for many reasons, but a large part of what we do revolves around farming, cooking and eating bugs, and when it comes to edible insects, the <i><a href=""https://entonation.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ento Nation</a></i> is where people go to get answers.</p>
<p>When I was a child in the 60's my hippie parents (my sister and I were literally among the first ""Flower Children"") used to set up a booth at certain fairs in Northern California. My dad made and sold jewelry at these fairs. I would dress up as a clown or mime and perform on the entertainment stages, and wander the fair randomly passing out candy to people. I even started doing it for friends and family birthdays, with my little sister joining in to help (see pic below circa 1972). This was before clowns got really creepy...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564373574/yjtakko1qjotpuiscq97.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I fell in love with the whole idea of traveling with a festival and bringing joy to festive crowds. I even wanted to join the traveling circus! But as I grew, well-meaning people let me know that what I wanted to do was not a ""real"" job. So I let go of that dream.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564266596/jj2dvrpt9d5rgeiznntw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Now, decades later, I find that dream has never left me. I got the initial idea for the whole Bug Wagon vision about a year ago, and have been developing it ever since (with help from Aly Moore, much Mahalos, Aly).</p>
<p>FYI, I will not be dressing up as a clown. </p>
<p>When life handed me a cancer scare a few months ago, there was about two weeks  between ""We want to biopsy for cancer."" and ""Benign! No cancer!"" During those two weeks I did a lot of thinking and soul searching. Unless you've been through that kind of thing, I can't tell you how freeing it is to come out alive and with another chance.  It opened my eyes, woke me up, and changed my life completely.</p>
<p>I refuse to be on my deathbed thirty years from now wondering what would have happened had I pursued my Bug Wagon dream with all of my heart and soul. I'm doing that right now, and I will never quit.</p>
<p>I believe in this idea. I believe it is a <i>good idea</i>.</p>
<p>The more people that hear our message, the more people that become interested in the whole idea of entomophagy (eating bugs on purpose). And that's what we're here to do: introduce people to the benefits of bugs to their bodies and to the planet in a positive way.</p>
<p>I am going to chase and fulfill this lifelong dream of bringing joy to people in a festival atmosphere, while at the same time truly helping to make the world a better place, and also helping further several worthy industries involved in the bug business.<i> </i></p>
<p><strong>One final note:</strong> I want to close with what I always like to share...</p>
<p>You don't have to wait for all of this sustainability stuff we talk about all of the time to kick in to start making the world a better place, you can do so right this very day. All you have to do is treat each and every person that you come in contact with each day with kindness, dignity and respect. Treat them as a VIP, as if they are the most important person in the world at that moment. Open a door for someone, ask to help carry something for a stranger, let the other person go in traffic, let someone go in front of you in line, smile, be nice, try to help. You do that, and you're already making the world a better place, and spreading half the message of the Bug Wagon!</p>

The Benefits of Bugs to People and Planet
""Bugs. Planet Friendly Protein.""
Edible insects use much less water and land, and produce much less methane than traditional protein sources like beef, pork, or poultry, yet are equally as healthy, and in some cases, actually healthier. They are definitely better for both people and the planet, as our ever-dwindling resources are having a very hard time keeping up with our ever-increasing population. The United Nations says that by 2050, we are going to have a problem trying to feed the world unless we do something now because of the resource drain.

We believe edible insects are a part of the answer. We're not asking people to completely replace their normal protein sources with edible insects, but if everyone set aside just one or two days per month to enjoy a delicious bug-based dish, the impact would be enormous.
What We Need
Our vision is big, deep, and wide, and we eventually want to cover the Earth. But we have to start somewhere. All visions have a beginning, and ours begins with one van, one pop-up tent (fully stocked), and our Maiden Voyage tour (October/November 2019).

Our First Van (of many)
We already have a van, a used Plymouth Voyager (the picture is an artist's concept, but the finished version will appear very similar) that needs some mechanical work. We need to get it running safe & sound and road ready; get it painted in the festive Bug Wagon décor, add the sponsor logos, and cover the costs of a short, proof-of-concept tour of roughly a dozen fairs, festivals, schools, civic groups, hot nightspots, select restaurants, and a parade or two in the Southern California area. There will also be administrative costs of licensing, insurance, etc.
The Pop-Up Tent
We also need to purchase a 10'x10' festival pop-up canopy with a back wall, custom printing, all display fixtures and other little pop-up store necessities, and cover things like payment services, inspection and licensing fees, and other costs.  Stocking the tent with goods will be a breeze. We have already worked out deals with over a dozen companies that will be supplying us with edible insects and related products, and more are being added all the time.
We'll be an edible insect extravaganzamart!
 

 
About Cricket Man's Bug Wagon Vision
Long ago I was a cook in the Coast Guard. I went through the USCG's (then-called) Subsistence Specialist school in Petaluma, which utilized the Culinary Institute of America's curriculum for institutional cooking. I was a state certified child day care administrator for over 10 years, farmed crickets for local pet stores for over 10 years, and in 2017 I started the Ento Nation podcast and infozine which now has reader/listeners in over 200 countries.
I am a bug lover.

 
“Cricket Man is the undisputed 
voice of the edible insect industry.”
-David George Gordon (aka The Bug Chef), author, The Eat-a-Bug Cookbook
 
Over the last two years I have come to know scores of people involved with bugs, from CEO's of edible insect companies, bug cooking experts, and food manufacturers, to entomologists, entomological thought leaders, and bug farmers from all over the world. People have been listening to and clicking on Ento Nation for many reasons, but a large part of what we do revolves around farming, cooking and eating bugs, and when it comes to edible insects, the Ento Nation is where people go to get answers.
When I was a child in the 60's my hippie parents (my sister and I were literally among the first ""Flower Children"") used to set up a booth at certain fairs in Northern California. My dad made and sold jewelry at these fairs. I would dress up as a clown or mime and perform on the entertainment stages, and wander the fair randomly passing out candy to people. I even started doing it for friends and family birthdays, with my little sister joining in to help (see pic below circa 1972). This was before clowns got really creepy...

I fell in love with the whole idea of traveling with a festival and bringing joy to festive crowds. I even wanted to join the traveling circus! But as I grew, well-meaning people let me know that what I wanted to do was not a ""real"" job. So I let go of that dream.

Now, decades later, I find that dream has never left me. I got the initial idea for the whole Bug Wagon vision about a year ago, and have been developing it ever since (with help from Aly Moore, much Mahalos, Aly).
FYI, I will not be dressing up as a clown. 
When life handed me a cancer scare a few months ago, there was about two weeks  between ""We want to biopsy for cancer."" and ""Benign! No cancer!"" During those two weeks I did a lot of thinking and soul searching. Unless you've been through that kind of thing, I can't tell you how freeing it is to come out alive and with another chance.  It opened my eyes, woke me up, and changed my life completely.
I refuse to be on my deathbed thirty years from now wondering what would have happened had I pursued my Bug Wagon dream with all of my heart and soul. I'm doing that right now, and I will never quit.
I believe in this idea. I believe it is a good idea.
The more people that hear our message, the more people that become interested in the whole idea of entomophagy (eating bugs on purpose). And that's what we're here to do: introduce people to the benefits of bugs to their bodies and to the planet in a positive way.
I am going to chase and fulfill this lifelong dream of bringing joy to people in a festival atmosphere, while at the same time truly helping to make the world a better place, and also helping further several worthy industries involved in the bug business. 
One final note: I want to close with what I always like to share...
You don't have to wait for all of this sustainability stuff we talk about all of the time to kick in to start making the world a better place, you can do so right this very day. All you have to do is treat each and every person that you come in contact with each day with kindness, dignity and respect. Treat them as a VIP, as if they are the most important person in the world at that moment. Open a door for someone, ask to help carry something for a stranger, let the other person go in traffic, let someone go in front of you in line, smile, be nice, try to help. You do that, and you're already making the world a better place, and spreading half the message of the Bug Wagon!
Chirpety-Chirp!

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Sunrise Bagel &amp; Coffee Co. is a dream project of mine that has been in the works for 5 years. I have always wanted to bring my east coast food culture to the mountains of Colorado. I have a background in nutrition, including food production and safety, have worked in several small cafes and coffee shops over the course of my life, and have experience managing large budgets and teams of people. Maybe more importantly is that I love food, I love people, and I love creating spaces for community to gather. I think Sunrise Bagel &amp; Coffee Co. will not only bring quality breakfast and lunch options to the Glenwood Meadows area, but it will be a place to have productive meetings, spend a day working outside the office, organize with your friends and neighbors, or grab some delicious food before heading for a hike or to the slopes.</p>

I also know the deep value of community that people feel in this part of Colorado and want to involve the community as much as possible in the making of this business.</p>

<p>We are rolling Kuvée out regionally to ensure quality service and fast shipping times. The first batch of Kuvée Bottles will ship to California &amp; Massachusetts residents in October 2016. We will ship more Kuvée Bottles to California, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon and Washington in December 2016, just in time for the holiday season. Rest assured, as long as you live in a state that allows Direct to Consumer wine shipments, we will be coming your way in early 2017. If you live in a state that's marked ""not available"" on the map, we're unfortunately not allowed to ship to you. Kuvée is currently only available in the United States - other countries to follow! </p>

<div><b>Who can order Kuvée?</b></div>
<div><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The first batch of 1000 Kuvée Bottles will ship to California &amp; Massachusetts residents in October 2016. Our first priority is creating an awesome customer experience, so we’re taking it slow, making Kuvée available to California &amp; Massachusetts residents first. Why? California is the largest wine market in the US and Massachusetts is home base to many of our friends, family and loyal beta users. Soon after, we will ship more Kuvée Bottles to additional major wine markets such as New York in December 2016, just in time for the holiday season. But rest assured, as long as you live in a state that allows direct to consumer wine shipments we’ll will be coming your way soon.</span></div>
<div>
<div><b>I live outside the US - will Kuvée be available to me?</b></div>
<div>We’re aiming to bring the Kuvée experience to other countries outside the US in the future, but cannot currently accept pre-orders from other countries.<br/>
</div>
<div>
<b>What are the advantages of pre-ordering a Kuvée before it ships in October?</b><br/>
</div>
<div>You’ll be amongst the first and select few Kuvée owners who are helping us bring this amazing new product to market. Your valuable feedback will help us develop new software features and improve our selection of wines and overall experience. In addition, depending on your perk of choice, you’ll save up to 50% off the future retail price including valuable bundles of our delicious wine to get you started!<br/>
</div>
<div><b>How does buying wine through Indiegogo work?</b></div>
<div>You're not technically buying the wine through Indiegogo, you're buying a voucher for our 4 Founder Wines (and maybe vouchers for wine credit too). <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">This voucher is a receipt of payment for four bottles of premium wine that have been ordered by you from the producer of wine that may be used with the Kuvee Bottle.  Payment in full for the wine was transmitted directly to the wine producer, who will confirm acceptance of your order and your purchase, as well as your eligibility to receive wine in your state and an attestation of your age, prior to shipping.</span><p></p>
<p>Presuming your order is accepted by the producing winery, the wines will be shipped to you from the winery on the same date the Kuvee Smart Bottle ships.</p>
</div>
<div>
<b>How many glasses are in each Kuvée Wine?</b><br/>
</div>
<div>Each Kuvée Wine contains 5 glasses, or 750ml of wine, same as a standard wine bottle you might purchase from your favorite shop.<br/>
</div>
<div>
<b>Is it possible to pour wines I already own into Kuvée?</b><br/>
</div>
<div>No. We fill following the same process and standards as glass bottles. This guarantees that the wine is filled under the watchful eye of our winemakers to assure maximum freshness and quality is delivered to you.<br/>
</div>
<div>
<b>Does Kuvée Wine require special storage or handling?</b><br/>
</div>
<div>Our wines don’t require any special handling. However, we suggest that when wines are not in use, you keep them in your refrigerator (both white and red wines). This makes sure they’re always handy, and more importantly, never too warm.<br/>
</div>
<div>
<b>How do I purchase more wine?</b><br/>
</div>
<div>There are three ways to order wine from Kuvée: from the Bottle’s touchscreen, via our mobile app, or at kuvee.com. To begin, visit kuvee.com and create an account with your billing, credit card and shipping information. When you are ready to purchase wines from your Kuvée Bottle, the smart label will lead you through prompts to connect to your WiFi network and then link the Kuvée Bottle to your account. In less than a minute or two you’ll be ordering more wines right from your Kuvée Bottle’s touchscreen. If you’re away from your Kuvée Bottle, you can always order more wine by downloading our app, or visiting kuvee.com to place an order from your phone, tablet or computer.</div>
<div><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>Will Kuvée wines be available in stores or shops other than kuvee.com?</b><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Not at this time. It’s possible you may find our wines in the tasting rooms of our partner wineries, or they may even be available through their online stores; but for now, we have no plans to sell our wines through brick and mortar retailers. This way we can afford to deliver the richness of the Kuvée experience, and we don’t have to charge a premium for our wines.<br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>How long will the Kuvée Bottle operate between charges?</b><br/></span></div>
A fully charged Kuvée Bottle will support up to 6 hours of activity, which allows you to use the touch screen label and access all of the sensor-generated drinking tips. When not in use, the bottle electronics will go to sleep, significantly extending battery life. The simplest thing to do is to just place your Kuvée Bottle back on the charging dock at the end of the day and let it recharge overnight.<br/>
</div>
<div>
<b>Do I have to connect to WiFi to use Kuvée?</b><br/>
</div>
Nope, but if you’re not connected to WiFi, you miss out on several key Kuvée features. Without WiFi you can’t shop for or purchase wines directly from the Kuvée Bottle. The indicator for drinking life remaining on each open wine package is disabled. You won’t have access to new wines, associated stories and interesting factoids through the Kuvée Bottle until an internet connection is established.<br/>

Craving something different? Simply eject the wine from your Kuvée Bottle, insert another wine, and pour.

Purchase your favorite wines from the WiFi connected Kuvée Bottle, for the same prices you'd pay in store.


Kuvée wines are 750ml, just like a regular wine bottle. 



Your wines are shipped right to your door. Once you're ready to enjoy, just insert your wine into the Kuvée Bottle. 



Kuvée keeps your wine fresh for up to 30 days, so mix it up and enjoy the wine you love whenever the mood strikes. Switching between wines is easy. 


Don’t know which wine to choose? Kuvée learns what you like and recommends more wines for you to try. And if you need more wine, you can order right from the Bottle through the integrated touchscreen display. 


Oh, and when you want to pour a glass, just tilt and pour like you would pour from a normal wine bottle!















 You might recognize our launch partners: they make some of the best wine in California. We're working with wineries like Bonny Doon, B.R. Cohn, Pine Ridge, Round Pond, Girard, and Schug to bring many of their most popular labels to the Kuvée marketplace. Don't see your favorite wine on the list? Not to worry -- we're just getting started and are actively growing our list of wineries and labels. By the time we start shipping in October, you'll be able to choose from at least 48 different yet delicious wines ranging from bold reds to fragrant whites. 














We are a seasoned team of wine lovers, winemakers, technologists, designers, engineers and marketers, with backgrounds from places like Keurig, Bladelogic, iRobot, Harvest Automation, Brontes Technologies, Rethink Robotics, MIT, and more. Every single one of us is passionate about making wine more accessible, affordable, convenient and most of all, fun.
Our wine experts, Vijay and Nils, are working with Masters of Wine and Master Sommeliers to bring a curated selection of wines to your fingertips. We are building a community of wine drinkers who give us their honest feedback and also suggest new wines to add to our growing selection.

  Kuvée is a team of experienced entrepreneurs, engineers, and marketers. We've been around for over two years, and have raised Venture Capital funding from places like General Catalyst, Founder Collective, and Bolt. A small group of wine lovers has helped us with their feedback since October 2015. Production at our manufacturing facilities has already begun and is on track for the schedule described above and we have already established relationships with a dozen top-notch wineries.

Who can order Kuvée?
The first batch of 1000 Kuvée Bottles will ship to California & Massachusetts residents in October 2016. Our first priority is creating an awesome customer experience, so we’re taking it slow, making Kuvée available to California & Massachusetts residents first. Why? California is the largest wine market in the US and Massachusetts is home base to many of our friends, family and loyal beta users. Soon after, we will ship more Kuvée Bottles to additional major wine markets such as New York in December 2016, just in time for the holiday season. But rest assured, as long as you live in a state that allows direct to consumer wine shipments we’ll will be coming your way soon.

I live outside the US - will Kuvée be available to me?
We’re aiming to bring the Kuvée experience to other countries outside the US in the future, but cannot currently accept pre-orders from other countries.


What are the advantages of pre-ordering a Kuvée before it ships in October?

You’ll be amongst the first and select few Kuvée owners who are helping us bring this amazing new product to market. Your valuable feedback will help us develop new software features and improve our selection of wines and overall experience. In addition, depending on your perk of choice, you’ll save up to 50% off the future retail price including valuable bundles of our delicious wine to get you started!

How does buying wine through Indiegogo work?
You're not technically buying the wine through Indiegogo, you're buying a voucher for our 4 Founder Wines (and maybe vouchers for wine credit too). This voucher is a receipt of payment for four bottles of premium wine that have been ordered by you from the producer of wine that may be used with the Kuvee Bottle.  Payment in full for the wine was transmitted directly to the wine producer, who will confirm acceptance of your order and your purchase, as well as your eligibility to receive wine in your state and an attestation of your age, prior to shipping.
Presuming your order is accepted by the producing winery, the wines will be shipped to you from the winery on the same date the Kuvee Smart Bottle ships.


How many glasses are in each Kuvée Wine?

Each Kuvée Wine contains 5 glasses, or 750ml of wine, same as a standard wine bottle you might purchase from your favorite shop.


Is it possible to pour wines I already own into Kuvée?

No. We fill following the same process and standards as glass bottles. This guarantees that the wine is filled under the watchful eye of our winemakers to assure maximum freshness and quality is delivered to you.


Does Kuvée Wine require special storage or handling?

Our wines don’t require any special handling. However, we suggest that when wines are not in use, you keep them in your refrigerator (both white and red wines). This makes sure they’re always handy, and more importantly, never too warm.


How do I purchase more wine?

There are three ways to order wine from Kuvée: from the Bottle’s touchscreen, via our mobile app, or at kuvee.com. To begin, visit kuvee.com and create an account with your billing, credit card and shipping information. When you are ready to purchase wines from your Kuvée Bottle, the smart label will lead you through prompts to connect to your WiFi network and then link the Kuvée Bottle to your account. In less than a minute or two you’ll be ordering more wines right from your Kuvée Bottle’s touchscreen. If you’re away from your Kuvée Bottle, you can always order more wine by downloading our app, or visiting kuvee.com to place an order from your phone, tablet or computer.
Will Kuvée wines be available in stores or shops other than kuvee.com?
Not at this time. It’s possible you may find our wines in the tasting rooms of our partner wineries, or they may even be available through their online stores; but for now, we have no plans to sell our wines through brick and mortar retailers. This way we can afford to deliver the richness of the Kuvée experience, and we don’t have to charge a premium for our wines.
How long will the Kuvée Bottle operate between charges?
A fully charged Kuvée Bottle will support up to 6 hours of activity, which allows you to use the touch screen label and access all of the sensor-generated drinking tips. When not in use, the bottle electronics will go to sleep, significantly extending battery life. The simplest thing to do is to just place your Kuvée Bottle back on the charging dock at the end of the day and let it recharge overnight.


Do I have to connect to WiFi to use Kuvée?

Nope, but if you’re not connected to WiFi, you miss out on several key Kuvée features. Without WiFi you can’t shop for or purchase wines directly from the Kuvée Bottle. The indicator for drinking life remaining on each open wine package is disabled. You won’t have access to new wines, associated stories and interesting factoids through the Kuvée Bottle until an internet connection is established.",43.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/>Nitro King N2 is a nitro coffee maker using pure nitrogen to make nitro cold brew coffee. You can use  N2 in your home or office to enjoy nitro cold brew coffee by using pure nitrogen without needs for complex tools. N2 uses 2g of pure nitrogen  to create fine bubbles called creamy head, allowing you to see waves of nitrogen called surging. Surging gives you the moment that makes you feel tasty of nitro cold brew coffee.</p>

</div></div>","Meet Nitro King 2 : The best at home nitro cold brew just got better.   Nitro King 2(N2) is the world’s first keg-type nitro cold brew coffee maker using pure nitrogen cartridge. If you want to enjoy nitro cold brew coffee with pure nitrogen cartridge just like you do in Starbucks or Stumptown Coffee, you need a lot of coffee tools at home. However, N2 allows people regardless of whether they are experienced in coffeemaking or not to make nitro cold brew coffee simple and easy. You can enjoy nitro cold brew coffee with creamy bubbles like black beer and sweet taste with N2.  Nitro King 2 is a way for you to enjoy expensive nitro cold brew coffee at affordable cost. You may easily make cold brew coffee with My Cold Brew and now you can use cold brew coffee to make nitro cold brew coffee with creamy texture of black beer.  Now is the time for new coffee. A lot of coffee brands such as Starbucks, Stumptown Coffee and Blue Bottle Coffee are selling cold brew and nitro cold brew coffee so that you can enjoy them in their coffeehouses or at home. Nitro cold brew coffee offer you rich flavor and creamy texture of black beer that you have never experienced in normal coffee. Brewing Company developed and tested products like Nitro Cold Brew Coffee Solutions with which you can enjoy nitro cold brew coffee wherever you want.  

 


We have launched our project for NITRO KING, a nitro cold brew coffee maker  in the last August 2017 and received a lot of support from our backers. When we are in the middle of producing NITRO KING, pure nitrogen cartridge in small sizes were not commercially available. Fortunately, we were lucky enough to purchase pure nitrogen cartridges and there we could plan to produce a nitro cold brew coffee maker using pure nitrogen cartridge.   
 

One of the reasons we are launching a crowdfunding project is not only we need expenses to cover the initial production but we can receive unexpected suggestions from our supporters in producing coffee tools so that we can reflect those suggestions in our planning of whole new products. This N2 project is also an outcome of your suggestion that you need a tool to use pure nitrogen cartridge during its development stage. That’s what made us to develop N2. 
 
 

Nitro cold brew coffee is based on cold brew coffee with nitrogen to have rich flavor and taste like Guinness black beer with soft texture. The combination of cold brew coffee and nitrogen at low temperature leads to molecular deformation that minimizes sour taste and increase chocolate-like taste and blackcurrant flavor. Nitro cold brew coffee has a lot of advantages including excellent taste and flavor.  Nitro cold brew coffee has a lot of advantages including excellent taste and flavor. 
How to make nitro cold brew coffee at home.

  -The N2 can replace all of the 3 different tools. - 
You need a nitrogen container, a large keg container and a tower in connection, if you want to enjoy nitro cold brew coffee at home. With N2, however, you don’t need complicated connections to enjoy creamy and sweet nitro cold brew coffee at home and in your office. 



Nitro King N2 is a nitro coffee maker using pure nitrogen to make nitro cold brew coffee. You can use  N2 in your home or office to enjoy nitro cold brew coffee by using pure nitrogen without needs for complex tools. N2 uses 2g of pure nitrogen  to create fine bubbles called creamy head, allowing you to see waves of nitrogen called surging. Surging gives you the moment that makes you feel tasty of nitro cold brew coffee.
 


When we first developed Nitro King, pure nitrogen cartridge required to make nitro cold brew coffee were not available in small sizes and therefore we used N2O cartridge for Nitro King as you can purchase them easily. However, after we released Nitro King, N2 cartridge became available and therefore we decided to launch N2 project allowing you to use pure nitrogen cartridge.   




The logo on N2 is based on the motif for the king of mankind, meaning that N2 will be the world’s best nitro cold brew coffee maker.  
N2 BODY : (1L STAINLESS STEEL KEG) 


N2 keg is made of stainless steel and therefore it is proper for cold brew coffee or iced drinks.
 
 N2 SILICONE SLEEVE 

 
In order to improve the grip for the stainless steel body of the keg, we have produced a silicone sleeve and combined it with the keg. This silicone sleeve will also serve as a grip for the small N2 keg.   
 
N2 FAUCET


The stout nozzle used in N2 is equipped with a creamy plate that produces rich cream with texture of black beer, offering an optimized design to make nitro cold brew coffee with quality taste. 
 
N2 TAP HANDLE

Walnut Tap Handle You need to pull the tap handle to make nitro cold brew coffee and therefore we planned to produce wooden handle with better grip than existing plastic ones and applied it to N2. 
 
N2 KEG CAP

 
N2 CARTRIDGE SHELL


* We cannot provide nitrogen cartridge as it is prohibited on the plane. You can purchase it on online markets such as Amazon.com or eBay.   

 
We have received a lot of suggestions from our backers to produce cartridge shell with metal and therefore the cartridge shell for N2 was made of aluminum compared to that in Nitro King.  .
The most important thing we took into account when we developed N2 was its design. Unlike Nitro King, N2 uses 2g of pure nitrogen cartridge only and therefore its body capacity is lower than that of Nitro King. Due to its smaller size, when you use the stout faucet in Nitro King for N2, this will cause the center of the weight in N2 to pull forward. In order to maintain its center of the weight while making the Nitro King faucet with the creamy plate available for N2, it was visually and functionally tested to be available.  
 
 N2 NEOPRENE COOLER
When you travel with N2 in a car or have it for outdoor activities, put the N2 keg into the neoprene cooler to prevent sunlight from increasing the temperature inside the keg or keep cold brew coffee or cold drinks in the keg cool. 
 
N2 Specifications

 

 

Pour 600 ml of cold brew coffee into the main body of N2.  
Combine the handle with the faucet and then assemble them with the coffee spear to combine with the main body.  
Put a 2g N2 cartridge into the cartridge shell.  
Combine the cartridge shell with the coffee spear of N2.   
Fix it to the spiral line and then rotate it until you hear a sound like blowing off from a bicycle tire.  
Shake it so that the cold brew coffee can be fully mixed with nitrogen and leave it to be ripe for 1 hour.  
Place the glass to the nozzle and then pull the handle to the front slowly. 

 

When you extract nitro cold brew coffee, you can see cascading like a waterfall that rises again. Soft but rich flavor will make you experience a whole new world of iced coffee.   
When you travel with Nitro King N2 in a car or have it for outdoor activities, put the N2 keg into the neoprene cooler to prevent sunlight from increasing the temperature inside the keg or keep cold brew coffee or cold drinks in the keg cool.

 
Portable Nitro Cold Brew Coffee Maker
 

N2 is a portable coffee maker. You can take it to your friend’s house, have it for outdoor activities or camping to enjoy nitro cold brew coffee anywhere. 
 
 

 

 
MY COLD BREW

MY COLD BREW FILTER


My Cold Brew Filter is our outcome to maintain the advantage of cold brew coffee by brewing and remove fines in an easy way.

My Cold Brew Filter is a double-layered disc filter to keep ingredients such as coffee oil that makes cold brew coffee taste good but to remove fines in an easy way. We also provide a folding silicone funnel which can be easily combined with the filter into the container. 

You only need to combine the double-layered stainless steel disc filter with the silicone funnel. Keep the side with My Cold Brew letters up to combine it with the second folding part of the silicone.

Our campaign to open a retail store is so important to us. It will enable us to offer our many healthy and organic food items to our customers and to our community. As a backer/buyer you will enable our dream to reach fruition and thereby touch and help many people realize the value of healthy eating and the rewards of understanding and tasting great food products from around the world. Imagine spices and specialty foods from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Europe, South America, and other far away lands right at your finger tips. That is what our retail store is about!</p>

What does a knife consists of? - Grip handle & Blade - if the blade is not sharp the knife is useless. Knives are in use for centuries & there are certain regions or countries that were famous for their art of craftsmanship & some are still considered the  Masters for making the best knives to this day.                          ` Supported and featured by About NagasakiWhat makes this knife unique is it’s combination of Japanese VG10 steel and it being hand-crafted in the city of Solingen, Germany. Where each step in the knifes production process goes through multiple quality control tests.The blade is a Damascus blade made from Japanese VG10 steel hand-hammered & hand forged.The blade has 67 cutting core layers which results in a higher durability of Nagasaki as compared to knives with normal VG10 steel having only 32 layers,Nagasaki has 67 cutting layers compared to normal knives having 32 cutting layersFor an ideal grip the Micarta wooden handle adds elegance and is ideal for both right and left handed.Micarta wooden handle, 2 colors Black & Brown Hammered finish helps to easily release food from the blade.Technical & Measuring Characteristics of NagasakiImportant: You will see lots of knives with hardness above 60, but in fact all Solingen knives have a hardness of HRC 54-60, which is ideal for durable and long lasting knives. The reason being the ability to easily resharpen the knife in all day use scenario, like a professional kitchen.Scientific Logic: High hardness of steel means that a blade is more rigid & tensile. In case that it falls down the blade is more likely to break. Nagasaki under quality tests: Balance, Grip & BladeNagasaki Edge Test Why on Indigogo ?Bringing this project to life is my goal. I already pumped in all my energy into this project.This is not for business,it is just to provide high quality product by eliminating the retail profit. So  people like me can get it at reasonable price.The retail price offered for the knife like this is between €165 - €215. At this stage i look forward to your help to raise € 4400. Why €4400?Nagasaki is ready to undergo production, final prototypes  have been successfully developed & tested. This € 4400 is the amount that will go directly towards sourcing the expert labor needed to start the production. As this is the amount missing in my production budget. Backers please back me to bring this Ultra sharp Chef Knife that will stay with you for years into reality!Timeline Appearance & Accessories Risks and challengesBiggest challenges that i see are delays, but they are minimal! Because, ...
This is a mature project, the crucial risks are already a past tense.
Specifically:
The R & D is done.
The prototypes have been produced.
The first production run has been funded via Kickstarter.

<h3>KI Roasters?</h3>
<p>My name is Bert Davis and I am the Owner and Roaster at KI Roasters based out of Denver, CO. I have been roasting for about 2 years and founded KI Roasters a little over a year ago. Our reviews, feedback, and overall knowledge growth of both coffee and coffee roasting has been exponential during that time.</p>
<p>This campaign will provide us with the much needed funds to take our concept of a mobile bike unit that provides hand crafted, hand poured, premium coffee and turn it into reality. The unit, being mobile, will give us the ability to travel throughout the city of Denver and educate the general public to specialty coffee, grow our brand name in the process, and create revenue that will help us reach our ultimate goal of building out our own brick and mortar shop. Your contribution will mean more to KI Roasters, my family, and the coffee community of Denver than we could ever explain in words!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is a ""Slow Bar""</h3>
<p>Have you ever been to fine dining restaurant, or a craft brewery tour, or just had something handmade with fresh ingredients?</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered where your coffee comes from? Who was the farmer who grew it? The mill that processed it? How did it get from a coffee plant in Ethiopia to my cup? Did you know that every coffee has a different flavor profile that is unique to the place it was grown, how it was processed and even how it was roasted? That every person who touches that coffee has an impact on what it tastes like?</p>
<p>This is what happens at a slow bar. Much like a wine tasting, a brewery tour, or a waiter's detailed explanation at a fine dining restaurant, the KI Roasters Mobile Slow Bar will take it's customers on a tour of coffee. We will freshly grind our customer's coffee right in front of them, brew it fresh in one of our hand poured methods (Chemex, Pour Over, Aeropress, etc), then explain the who, what, and where of the specific origin they chose to drink. </p>
<p>(For high volume events we will also offer high quality batch brew coffee that will be available quickly and upon demand. We will also offer a nitro cold brew tap as well as plan for future expansion to offer espresso drinks.)</p>
<p>For the curious folks who want more detailed info on ""slow bars"" check out this awesome article by Laura Clark detailing their success and popularity:</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Coffee is the #2 most traded commodity in the world next to oil. The coffee culture and population in Denver is booming even more so than other areas of the country. Although there are plenty of specialty coffee shops and roasters in the Denver area, there is a shortage of mobile educational and experience driven coffee units like the KI Roasters Mobile Slow Bar available to our community. We believe that the impact we will have on the coffee culture in Denver will be HUGE!</p>
<p>We also believe that this unit will have a tremendous impact on the future of KI Roasters. We do hope to one day open our own brick and mortar but the cost and logistics of such a project far exceeds that of this step. A commercial espresso machine alone costs almost as much as this entire campaign.</p>
<p>We believe that, while building the coffee community of Denver, we will also be building our brand and allowing us to gain valuable revenue that will aid in our ultimate brick and mortar goal. This project also contains many items that will not be necessary for us to purchase when that next step becomes reality. When we do eventually reach that point, we will be better prepared in both experience and finances. It truly is a win for everyone!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk with this venture is that we build it and nobody cares. We do believe that the coffee culture in Denver is such that support will be there, however, we have plans in place to avoid any let down. That is where some business sense and a lot of sweat and hard work come in. We plan to have a regular presence in some of the major parks in Denver as well as at some of the more trendy farmers markets in the area. We will also be marketing ourselves to events both public and private.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Honestly the best thing that you can do to help us, other than contribute financially, is to help spread the word about what we are doing! It doesn't matter if you live in Denver or not. Share on social media via the links at the top of the page. Email friends and let them know about this cool project we are doing. Or do it the old fashioned way and talk to them in person about KI Roasters. No one will turn you down for coffee! Coffee knows no gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. Coffee is conversation. Coffee is community.</p>

My name is Bert Davis and I am the Owner and Roaster at KI Roasters based out of Denver, CO. I have been roasting for about 2 years and founded KI Roasters a little over a year ago. Our reviews, feedback, and overall knowledge growth of both coffee and coffee roasting has been exponential during that time.
This campaign will provide us with the much needed funds to take our concept of a mobile bike unit that provides hand crafted, hand poured, premium coffee and turn it into reality. The unit, being mobile, will give us the ability to travel throughout the city of Denver and educate the general public to specialty coffee, grow our brand name in the process, and create revenue that will help us reach our ultimate goal of building out our own brick and mortar shop. Your contribution will mean more to KI Roasters, my family, and the coffee community of Denver than we could ever explain in words!
 

What is a ""Slow Bar""
Have you ever been to fine dining restaurant, or a craft brewery tour, or just had something handmade with fresh ingredients?
Have you ever wondered where your coffee comes from? Who was the farmer who grew it? The mill that processed it? How did it get from a coffee plant in Ethiopia to my cup? Did you know that every coffee has a different flavor profile that is unique to the place it was grown, how it was processed and even how it was roasted? That every person who touches that coffee has an impact on what it tastes like?
This is what happens at a slow bar. Much like a wine tasting, a brewery tour, or a waiter's detailed explanation at a fine dining restaurant, the KI Roasters Mobile Slow Bar will take it's customers on a tour of coffee. We will freshly grind our customer's coffee right in front of them, brew it fresh in one of our hand poured methods (Chemex, Pour Over, Aeropress, etc), then explain the who, what, and where of the specific origin they chose to drink. 
(For high volume events we will also offer high quality batch brew coffee that will be available quickly and upon demand. We will also offer a nitro cold brew tap as well as plan for future expansion to offer espresso drinks.)

The Impact
Coffee is the #2 most traded commodity in the world next to oil. The coffee culture and population in Denver is booming even more so than other areas of the country. Although there are plenty of specialty coffee shops and roasters in the Denver area, there is a shortage of mobile educational and experience driven coffee units like the KI Roasters Mobile Slow Bar available to our community. We believe that the impact we will have on the coffee culture in Denver will be HUGE!
We also believe that this unit will have a tremendous impact on the future of KI Roasters. We do hope to one day open our own brick and mortar but the cost and logistics of such a project far exceeds that of this step. A commercial espresso machine alone costs almost as much as this entire campaign.
We believe that, while building the coffee community of Denver, we will also be building our brand and allowing us to gain valuable revenue that will aid in our ultimate brick and mortar goal. This project also contains many items that will not be necessary for us to purchase when that next step becomes reality. When we do eventually reach that point, we will be better prepared in both experience and finances. It truly is a win for everyone!

Risks & Challenges
The biggest risk with this venture is that we build it and nobody cares. We do believe that the coffee culture in Denver is such that support will be there, however, we have plans in place to avoid any let down. That is where some business sense and a lot of sweat and hard work come in. We plan to have a regular presence in some of the major parks in Denver as well as at some of the more trendy farmers markets in the area. We will also be marketing ourselves to events both public and private.

Other Ways You Can Help
Honestly the best thing that you can do to help us, other than contribute financially, is to help spread the word about what we are doing! It doesn't matter if you live in Denver or not. Share on social media via the links at the top of the page. Email friends and let them know about this cool project we are doing. Or do it the old fashioned way and talk to them in person about KI Roasters. No one will turn you down for coffee! Coffee knows no gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. Coffee is conversation. Coffee is community.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We - Crowd Cookware - are creating our own chef-grade cookware together with our crowd. All for a fair price. Like kitchen pirates, we collaborate with manufacturers who normally only produce for elite brands. This is how we hack the cookware industry on Kickstarter!</p>
<p>All in the space of 1.5 years we joined forces with thousands of backers worldwide: we created a non-stick, non-scratch frying pan and a lifetime sharp chef’s knife with more than 7.000 backers from 67 countries. Trusted by Michelin star chefs and well received by our crowd on Kickstarter: one of our campaigns even became the biggest food success on Kickstarter. </p>

<p>Creating knives is all about making choices. However, we've made no concessions on lifetime use, at the request of our crowd. Even better: by following 8 principles we’ve pushed the boundaries of manufacturing possibilities and service beyond premium standards. With the ultimate goal: ensuring lifetime use.</p>
<div data-id=""27266582""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1576776318/jecewd2r5qrhqp1jmzja.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>We found the ultimate ratio between sharpness and strength: not too thick for optimal slice performance, not too thin, so the cutting edge won't lose strength.</p>
<p>All blades are made of tough German stainless steel with a Rockwell Hardness scale of 55-57. <span>Sharpness is key</span>: with extreme accuracy, the blade is auto-sharpened to control the angle precisely. Cutting edges are sharpened on both sides with respectively 12-14 degrees to make sure the cutting edge is perfectly balanced</p>
<div data-id=""27128526""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1576776321/xwrvjkp5o59qzyqngsr3.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>

<p>Cheaper plastic or wooden handles are simply not an option when designing knives for lifetime use. The materials are weaker, discolour over time and are - once broken - a breeding ground for bacteria. We did not want to make concessions in order to optimize profit margins, so we selected stainless steel as our favorite material.</p>
<div data-id=""27198171""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1576776325/i1c3i4sztczpmeq0b9p3.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>

<p>Our kitchen knife set is carefully selected to handle anything. Especially the Wigbold chef’s knife, since it will be used most often. With this in mind, we knew we had to take bold design decisions.</p>
<p>The heel of the blade is 23% wider than premium chef’s knives for intensive use. We also made sure the blade is 18% bigger than elite standards, resulting in a longer cutting edge for optimal slicing. Because the blade’s heel is bigger, you can sharpen over a lifetime. </p>
<div data-id=""27198205""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1576776329/ezmchveashotngijcgab.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>

<p>Period. We believe our responsibility doesn’t stop once the knives are delivered. Just a matter of good hostmanship (see also principle eight). Each set with a Wigbold chef's knife includes a sharpening stone with code 1000/6000, to maintain your cutting edge. Is your knife dull? Use the 1000 to give its sharpness a boost and finish with the 6000 to refine your knife edge. </p>

<p>We, as Crowd Cookware, selected German steel instead of Japanese steel, because it’s durable, more resistant to high temperatures and more wear-resistant. Japanese steel contains a higher volume of carbon, making it harder, but also more fragile and more susceptible to rust.</p>
<p>Even more important: we partnered up with an elite knife manufacturer that only works for the premium brands and measures heat treatment after the production process, with extreme accuracy. With a guaranteed Rockwell Hardness scale of 55-57, as a result</p>
<div data-id=""27198301""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1576776334/yicwvub0pcfh2txqkqhv.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>

<p>To ensure lifetime use, stainless steel won’t do the job on its own. A knife has to be bold enough to handle many (wet) ingredients. That’s why we partnered up with one of the few knife manufacturers who can do more and meet our high demands: blade heat treatment with anti-rust oil, also tested on worldwide food safety standards by TÜV Rijnland, a renowned German testing institute.The blade absorbs the anti-rust oil during the heat treatment process, to make it perform better.</p>

<p>When stored properly, Crowd Cookware knives can last a lifetime. We believe the only way to store the knives careful, safe and hygienic is to use a magnetic knife block. This is why: knife blocks are a breeding ground for bacteria and an ease place for food bits to get stuck. A magnetic knife block, on the other hand, keeps the food bits and bacteria at bay. Huge benefit: the knives will literally look over your shoulder in the kitchen. Crowd Cookware’s kitchen knife block is made of sustainable rubberwood and named after backer Jim who suggested to create a knife block.</p>

<p>All of our knives are designed for lifetime use. However, we believe the Wigbold chef's knife will be used most often: it's the kitchen workhorse. Our pirate code is especially created for the Wigbold, to make sure it stays sharp for your daily work. To sharpen your knife at home, you can check out our video. Still unable to re-sharpen your chef's knife? We got your back: send us your Wigbold and we'll return it razor sharp for free. Once a pirate, always a pirate. </p>

<p>Similar to our Blackbeard pans and the Wigbold chef’s knife, all blades are mirror-polished which reduces food sticking to the blade and makes the design look sleek and minimalistic.</p>
<p>The blade flows seamlessly into the handle and is finished with our well-known honeycomb pattern to ensure grip. Whatever the size of your hand, the handle feels good. Detail: the angles of the heels are shaped into a hexagon.</p>

We love participating in this design process and are actually quite proud of the result: we're really curious to what you, our fellow backers, think about it! Although Crowd Cookware takes over from here, you will see some of us back in the project video or future updates.



We - Crowd Cookware - are creating our own chef-grade cookware together with our crowd. All for a fair price. Like kitchen pirates, we collaborate with manufacturers who normally only produce for elite brands. This is how we hack the cookware industry on Kickstarter!
All in the space of 1.5 years we joined forces with thousands of backers worldwide: we created a non-stick, non-scratch frying pan and a lifetime sharp chef’s knife with more than 7.000 backers from 67 countries. Trusted by Michelin star chefs and well received by our crowd on Kickstarter: one of our campaigns even became the biggest food success on Kickstarter. 

Now it's time to deal with the tsunami of overpriced kitchen knives. Let’s introduce 6 knives, designed for lifetime use. Made of strong German steel and heat treated with anti-rust oil.





 






Creating knives is all about making choices. However, we've made no concessions on lifetime use, at the request of our crowd. Even better: by following 8 principles we’ve pushed the boundaries of manufacturing possibilities and service beyond premium standards. With the ultimate goal: ensuring lifetime use.

We found the ultimate ratio between sharpness and strength: not too thick for optimal slice performance, not too thin, so the cutting edge won't lose strength.
All blades are made of tough German stainless steel with a Rockwell Hardness scale of 55-57. Sharpness is key: with extreme accuracy, the blade is auto-sharpened to control the angle precisely. Cutting edges are sharpened on both sides with respectively 12-14 degrees to make sure the cutting edge is perfectly balanced


Cheaper plastic or wooden handles are simply not an option when designing knives for lifetime use. The materials are weaker, discolour over time and are - once broken - a breeding ground for bacteria. We did not want to make concessions in order to optimize profit margins, so we selected stainless steel as our favorite material.


Our kitchen knife set is carefully selected to handle anything. Especially the Wigbold chef’s knife, since it will be used most often. With this in mind, we knew we had to take bold design decisions.
The heel of the blade is 23% wider than premium chef’s knives for intensive use. We also made sure the blade is 18% bigger than elite standards, resulting in a longer cutting edge for optimal slicing. Because the blade’s heel is bigger, you can sharpen over a lifetime. 


Period. We believe our responsibility doesn’t stop once the knives are delivered. Just a matter of good hostmanship (see also principle eight). Each set with a Wigbold chef's knife includes a sharpening stone with code 1000/6000, to maintain your cutting edge. Is your knife dull? Use the 1000 to give its sharpness a boost and finish with the 6000 to refine your knife edge. 


We, as Crowd Cookware, selected German steel instead of Japanese steel, because it’s durable, more resistant to high temperatures and more wear-resistant. Japanese steel contains a higher volume of carbon, making it harder, but also more fragile and more susceptible to rust.
Even more important: we partnered up with an elite knife manufacturer that only works for the premium brands and measures heat treatment after the production process, with extreme accuracy. With a guaranteed Rockwell Hardness scale of 55-57, as a result


To ensure lifetime use, stainless steel won’t do the job on its own. A knife has to be bold enough to handle many (wet) ingredients. That’s why we partnered up with one of the few knife manufacturers who can do more and meet our high demands: blade heat treatment with anti-rust oil, also tested on worldwide food safety standards by TÜV Rijnland, a renowned German testing institute.The blade absorbs the anti-rust oil during the heat treatment process, to make it perform better.


When stored properly, Crowd Cookware knives can last a lifetime. We believe the only way to store the knives careful, safe and hygienic is to use a magnetic knife block. This is why: knife blocks are a breeding ground for bacteria and an ease place for food bits to get stuck. A magnetic knife block, on the other hand, keeps the food bits and bacteria at bay. Huge benefit: the knives will literally look over your shoulder in the kitchen. Crowd Cookware’s kitchen knife block is made of sustainable rubberwood and named after backer Jim who suggested to create a knife block.


All of our knives are designed for lifetime use. However, we believe the Wigbold chef's knife will be used most often: it's the kitchen workhorse. Our pirate code is especially created for the Wigbold, to make sure it stays sharp for your daily work. To sharpen your knife at home, you can check out our video. Still unable to re-sharpen your chef's knife? We got your back: send us your Wigbold and we'll return it razor sharp for free. Once a pirate, always a pirate. 


Similar to our Blackbeard pans and the Wigbold chef’s knife, all blades are mirror-polished which reduces food sticking to the blade and makes the design look sleek and minimalistic.
The blade flows seamlessly into the handle and is finished with our well-known honeycomb pattern to ensure grip. Whatever the size of your hand, the handle feels good. Detail: the angles of the heels are shaped into a hexagon.
 


Creating cookware with our crowd is all about translating feedback to actual changes to the final design of the knives. We believe this is the only way to create great cookware. Thanks everyone who contributed to the set via comments, surveys or live testing sessions.  Check the video below.
 



In more than a year, Crowd Cookware evolved into a worldwide community of kitchen pirates creating their own chef-grade cookware for a fair price. How? By using a smuggling route to top manufacturers who normally only produce for elite brands.

All funds we raised, and those raised in the future, will be spent on creating chef-grade cookware and surprising our most important partner in crime: the crowd",47.0,0,"4 Campaigns

Hi
Everyone â€“ thanks for stopping by and having a look at my IndieGoGo page! 

Hereâ€™s
a bit of history... Several years ago, I started a company called ""Milks
Alive"" and produced fresh pressed almond milks which, originally sold out
of my house, blossomed into a full fledged business.  Eventually we moved to our local farmers
markets in Santa Cruz and Monterey counties in California.

We
were very successful at the farmers markets and within one year expanded our
product line from three milk offerings to more then eleven blends, including a
few vegan custards.

We
built a faithful following at the farmersâ€™ market and Whole Foods offered to
carry our fresh milks in their northern California stores. After much
consideration and several meetings, I decided it was not the right direction
for me.  

My
greatest desire was to publish my first recipe book and open a retail location
to expand my offerings of vegan milks and desserts.  A retail location is
presently in the works â€“ so look out for more information about that!

The
beginnings of this book started about 7 years ago as I continued to hone my
skills working with plant based milks and finding the best way to create creamy
custards with my milk blends and explore creating delicious vegan caramel
sauces.

My
Milks Alive recipe book for plant based milks and custards and caramels is ready
for design and editing. Your pledge will take me one step closer to publishing
my book!

Thanks
for taking the time â€“ and a pledge of any amount will be greatly appreciatedâ€¦Rita


The Impact


It is my desire to help people lead healthier lives by giving them
nutritious, delicious choices that can replace or be an adjunct to using dairy
by incorporating the use of a variety of nuts and seeds.

The numbers for lactose intolerance or dairy sensitivity are high
and many people do not even know they have a sensitivity to dairy, which was my
own experience. When I took dairy out of my diet, my â€œallergiesâ€ disappeared,
and my digestion improved tremendously.

My book will stimulate new ideas for food choices, as we embrace
plants as food and minimize the impact of using animals as food.

 

What We Need & What You Get


The
money raised through your pledges will go directly into the editing and design
of the book, and support the process of self-publishing.

The
cost of designing and printing a recipe book is higher, based on photographs /
illustrations and the use of color.

Check
out our pledges - at $25, your name will be listed in the book as a
""Special Friend"". At $100 a signed copy of the book, higher pledges
receive almonds - and at the $500 pledge level, a recipe is named after you!


Other Ways You Can Help


Social
media is a powerful tool! If you like the idea of encouraging people to use

WTF!""-Tuomas P. FixU Drink is a pinnacle of over 20 months of research and development. We have formulated the world's most effective hangover recovery drink and are ready to start global production. We have already produced FixU for our local market in the Nordic countries but in order to take on the global market, we need your help. This is another revolutionary superfood from the Nordics.   FixU Drink is not a magic potion, though it works like one. It’s a dietary supplement containing wonderful nutrients. FixU Drink is a widely studied, high-quality functional drink with a nice taste that fixes the harmful effects of alcohol in the body, keeping hangover at bay. All of the ingredients in the drink are natural and benefit the general well-being of the body. The revolutionary ingredient in FixU is Dihydromyricetin (DHM). DHM for short is a plant-based compound extracted from the Japanese raisin tree (Hovenia Dulcis). DHM has been known in Asia for a long time, especially in the medicine traditions of Japan and China, and in the West, it has been studied only since the 1980s. DHM has many uses, one of the most important, is the prevention of the symptoms of alcohol poisoning and alcohol withdrawal.All FixU´s natural ingredients are backed up with reseach and clinical data.FixU is compact and easy to drink, it´s environment friendly and tastes great with tropical flavor. FixU is lactose-free, gluten-free, vegan, nut-free and there´s no added sugar.It’s very, very easy. All you have to do is remember to drink FixU before going to sleep. The effects kick in while you sleep, and you’ll wake up without the usual pains in the morning. Then just go do whatever you wanted to do. No more cancelled plans because of han​gover! FixU is for you if you:Like to relax sometimes and break away from everyday worries, say by having a beer (or two) on the weekend.Are active and want to look after your health.Enjoy wine tasting, special beer brews, and rare whiskey brands.Need a little encouragement when spending an evening with your organization, workplace, or group of friends.Then FixU might be just the thing you´ve been looking for.FixU is already available!

<h3>What is PJ's Grill?</h3>
<p>Quite simply, PJ's Grill is my dream.  I've been running a very successful food truck for the last 3 years, but I was working for someone else.  It's time for me to venture out on my own, so I'm opening my own gourmet burger truck. With unique burger selections and a fun, slightly sassy atmosphere, I'm looking to build on the success of my last truck, which was nominated as one of the top 5 trucks in Minnesota last year. Owning my own business has been a dream of mine for years, and I'm asking for your help to get me there.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're trying to raise $10,000 in capital.  My truck will cost roughly $65,000 to build, so every dollar raised will go toward the purchase and build of my mobile kitchen.  In exchange for your contribution, we're offering some sweet stuff as a means of showing our gratitude:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contribute $20 or more and you'll get one of our awesome can koozies, decorated with our logo and our slogan, ""Put Our Meat In Your Mouth.""</li>
<li>Contribute $100 or more and you'll get the koozie PLUS a PJ's Grill T-Shirt!</li>
<li>Contribute $500 or more and you'll get the koozie, the T-Shirt, AND an invite to our soft opening, which will be held in August at a local taproom!  Free food, and the opportunity to be among the first to try our new culinary creations!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>The food truck industry is a challenging, competitive landscape.  Your contribution, no matter how large or small, gets me one step closer to being able to compete and thrive in this industry.  I've always had a passion for cooking, and for serving others.  I'm asking you to help me pursue those passions, to help me realize my dream.  If you can't contribute financially, you can still help by sharing this campaign far and wide!  Every dollar, every share, makes a difference.  From the bottom of my heart, thank you for taking the time to read this campaign, and for helping in whatever way you can.  God Bless.</p>

<p>Hello, I'm Chris Weitzel. I've been making beer at my home since early 2012, and now I'm trying to take the next step and move to a full production microbrewery. In the five years that I have been brewing, I have learned a lot about beer and beer production, as well as the wonderful community that surrounds the industry. It is my hope that with your help I can bring some of that magic to McMinnville, Tennessee and the surrounding area. By backing Depot Bottom Brewery, not only are you helping bring high quality local craft beer to McMinnville, but also allowing me to share the amazing world of the craft beer industry and home brewing with others.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Breaking into the beer business is costly, and I have spent the past 2 years researching and planning the best course for the brewery. We are asking for $35,000 to get us off the ground and producing beer. Close to $20,000 of that will go to the purchase of production equipment and necessary components to produce beer at a professional level. The remaining funds will go toward renovating the building for the tap room, home brew shop, and brewing classroom we plan to incorporate. </p>
<p>We have a large variety of backing levels, each with an awesome reward that goes with it. This is the best way to get Depot Bottom Brewery swag right now, and some of the items will never be available again. Personal Glass space is very limited, as is access to our V.I.P. Program! All rewards will be available for pick up at the brewery. (Exceptions will be available on a case by case basis for out of town donors.) All rewards will not be immediately available, as we are offering some exclusive, never to be made again items, and they will be ordered after our campaign ends. We will let everyone know when they can cash in on their awesome rewards!</p>
<p>Because of the wonderful way Indiegogo works, we will receive all funds pledged regardless of whether we reach our goal. Because of this, we will still be giving out rewards to everyone that backs us (So if you pledge, you get your swag whether we reach our goal or not! It's a win-win really). With the funds we do receive, we will move forward the best we can and bring craft beer to McMinnville, and your support will help make that possible.</p>

The son and grandson of successful small business owners, Matt strives to follow in the footsteps of his forebearers and create a successful small business that  provides enjoyment for the local community.  He believes Old Tappan Brewing Company is the perfect platform to develop and continue the successful business tradition that has been an integral part of his family heritage.Brent Kunkle has been a resident of Long Island since 2011. He and his wife, Kate, call Sea Cliff, NY home. Brent holds a ten year career as a producer in the film and television industry. His feature films have premiered at top festivals including Sundance and have played theatrically across the world. He has done television work for CNN, A&E, Showtime and most recently Animal Planet's ""The Zoo."" He and brew partner, Matt Cryan, met as crew members in 2007 on the set of the feature film “I Sell the Dead” starring Ron Perlman. They have kept a close friendship and mutual love for home brewing ever since.MISSIONOur current mission is to obtain a foothold in the professional craft beer brewing industry, start selling our beer, and grow into a successful craft brewery.Our goals will include:Secure a properly zoned location where we can brew our beer.Build out the brewing, fermenting, and storage areas.Secure federal, state and local licensing requirements.Brew and sell our first batches of commercial beer.Sustain initial momentum and grow.THIS IS WHERE YOU COME INThis crowd funding campaign will allow us to survive our first year of licensing and the initial build.  HERE'S THE KICKER!

<h3>Why HippieCakes Vegan Bakery?</h3>
<p>We talk about community a lot.  HippieCakes Vegan Bakery is being built in a town (Raymond, NH) with limited spaces for young adults to spend their time at.  We don't just want to build a space for vegans to hang out, we want to build a space that's safe for everyone, but especially kids to come to after school, where they can sit and enjoy a pastry or a sandwich while they're finishing up their homework, or reading the latest and greatest teen novel.  A place where parents  will know they can bring their children in while they gab with their friends, and won't have to worry about whether or not the staff will be bothered by their presence.  (We won't be.  We love kids!) </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>With every new business venture, there is always the opportunity for failure.  We've hit our fair share of hiccups in the last six years, but we have overcome each and every one of them.  We've had to change the way we do things, we've had to hire extra help on occasion, and scale back the business on other occasions.  But we love what we do, so we find a way. </p>
<p>Having a brick and mortar bakery is far different from running a wholesale business out of our home, and that's a little scary.  We have an amazing support system, complete with small business owners, fellows bakers, passionate people, and others who just get what we're doing and will be there to guide us along the way. </p>

<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help:</strong></h3>

If there is such a thing as the one indispensable tool, this is it. As a self-confessed food enthusiast and amateur chef, I wanted to own the very best Chef Knife I could find. And I wanted it to be the cornerstone of my new housewares company, <b>Habitat</b>. What I soon learned, though, was that not much has changed in knife-making in over <b>200 years</b>!</p><p>Knife manufacturers have tried to address the same problems for centuries. The steel may be too soft, the knives get <i>dull</i> quickly, they need lots of maintenance, and they may react with food. Ceramic knives have problems, too.

If there is such a thing as the one indispensable tool, this is it. As a self-confessed food enthusiast and amateur chef, I wanted to own the very best Chef Knife I could find. And I wanted it to be the cornerstone of my new housewares company, Habitat. What I soon learned, though, was that not much has changed in knife-making in over 200 years!Knife manufacturers have tried to address the same problems for centuries. The steel may be too soft, the knives get dull quickly, they need lots of maintenance, and they may react with food. Ceramic knives have problems, too. They can be brittle and break easily.I felt certain there must be a way to move knife-making into the 21st century. My search led me to a remarkable metal alloy initially developed by Caltech and tested by NASA – and later patented. I acquired the rights to use this metal alloy and set about determining how best to use it in making a game-changing Chef Knife that would reinvent the industry and become the new standard.  A Chef Knife’s sharpness is THE most critical attribute – and the knife edge angle is the critical factor that determines sharpness. The harder the material is, the sharper the blade can be made. But in ordinary steel knives, a higher level of hardness also makes the knife harder to maintain, and the edge chips easily. The Habitat KNASA Chef Knife edge is made from this Caltech and NASA developed metal alloy, which is harder than any steel yet isn’t brittle and resists rust.The hardness of a metal alloy is measured utilizing the Rockwell (HRC) testing standard. VERY expensive knives, costing hundreds of dollars, are made from higher carbon steel that is brittle and can rust. High carbon steel hardness can reach the low 60s on the Rockwell scale. (And it is interesting to note that two recent popular and successful Crowdfunded knives only have Rockwell hardness in the higher 50s.) The Habitat KNASA Chef Knife blows away the competition with a 70+ reading on the Rockwell scale! The CATRA Analysis Shows the Sharpness and Durability Superiorityof the Habitat KNASA Chef Knife Most importantly, what this means for YOU is that the Habitat KNASA Chef Knife surpasses anything else on the market. It holds its edge better and longer due to the hardness of the metal alloy. And it isn’t brittle because the edge is the patented metal alloy, not just steel. The combination of hardness, high elasticity, and corrosion resistance makes the metal alloy edge wear resistant.It also allows us to sustain an aggressive angle for our edge of just 12.5 degrees on each side for a total of 25 degrees. (Most knives are manufactured with a combined angle of 30 degrees.) What does this mean? The sharper the angle, the easier and more precise the cut. And isn’t that what you want?The Habitat KNASA Knife is ultra-sharp and lasts 5 times longer than ordinary knives.This is the “super-secret sauce” that sets my Chef Knife apart from the competition and makes it the Gold Standard and star of any kitchen. The patented metal alloy edge possesses a natural nano-serration at the molecular level. This serration is like microscopic, ultra-hard “teeth” that are what make the effortless and breathtaking cutting power of the Habitat KNASA Chef Knife possible. The KNASA Chef Knife's Nano-Serration Is What CutsTomatoes, Meat, and Crusty Bread Equally Well
 Another benefit of this nano-serration is the self-sharpening aspect of the microscopic teeth. As the knife is used, these tiny teeth are exposed and essentially sharpen themselves – and this is part of what allows the Habitat KNASA Chef Knife to retain its ultimate edge far longer than other knives.  It wasn’t enough to just acquire the use of the NASA-tested metal alloy. We needed to develop a process for bonding this metal alloy to the high-quality stainless steel knife blank that would comprise the rest of the Habitat KNASA Chef Knife. This required the time and effort to perfect the process shown in this video clip: 
 While my Chef Knife reinvents the category with its revolutionary edge, there are still proven Chef Knife features that matter – and I have made certain they are part of the Habitat KNASA Chef Knife.Here are a few:
The tip is thin and sharp for precise detail cutting.
Perfect weight so the knife feels like a balanced extension of your hand.
A professional profile with a taller blade at the heel.
The classic pinch grip preferred by experienced chefs.
A gorgeous, distinctive handle that is ergonomically designed and made from pakkawood.
To accomplish these goals, my team and I spent countless hours working on variations of our Habitat KNASA Chef Knife – making sure we got it right. This video clip shares some of this important thinking with you: Other knife-makers talk endlessly about the minor differences between their knives and others. They show pictures and diagrams and go on and on. Yes, these features matter, and I’ve paid close attention to them, too, as you have seen.But these others don’t have anything more important and different to talk about.

Currently the rink has skaters on it from 6:00am to 12:00 midnight every day during the skating season, with no room for expansion. The shortage of ice makes it difficult to add more skaters, offer public skating, host tournaments or provide training for competitive figure skaters.  While Bozeman is centrally located in Montana, youth hockey and figure skaters travel hundreds of miles every year to other communities because ice time is unavailable here. Since 2007 the GIF – a non-profit group appointed with representatives of both the figure skating and hockey clubs – has been focused on raising funds for a second facility adjacent to the current rink at the fairgrounds.  The building plans, lead by BAHA, has been completely designed for a modest facility that will offer year-round ice capabilities, can host Junior Hockey league games and offer tremendous growth in youth and adult skating opportunities. With a portion of the funds already raised (from donors, the City of Bozeman and local businesses and support from the Gallatin County Commissioners and Fairgrounds Board), the building phases are underway.  Phase one will erect the steel building that will eventually house a completely refrigerated ice sheet and seats for up to 1500 spectators.  With the completion of all the phases, this facility will be a valuable community center attracting skaters of all ages and used for community events both on and off the ice.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Thai Burger Cafe is considered by the locals as a true neighborhood restaurant, a local gem and we consider all of our customers to be part of our extended family. With the help of this campaign, we want to not only continue to provide them with homemade food in an unpretentious environment.  But with faster service and delivery.  That was the reason we wanted to move to a bigger space.  Former Jim and Mike was a dream come true, or so we thought.  This was suppose to be a quick transition, since it was a preexisting restaurant.  We were going to closed for about 10 days, we are now into our fifth weeks.  Jim and Mike needed a major over haul.  We don't want to go into details of our plight but we do have one more major obstacle left.  Everyone that knows us knows how much this new venture means to us and how hard we’ve worked to get to this stage. This is not a flashy refurb, that's just not us, its simply a matter of creating something special that we can share with the community, a place with heart, a place for everyone to enjoy and be a part of.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
<p>Fire official require that we submit a seal engineered drawing of the preexisting hood and fire suppression system since they don't have one on record.  In order for us to be open. In addition to already spending tens of thousand dollar already.  This project will cost us an additional $7,600 to complete.  This amount wouldn't be so bad if we were still operating. But since we've been closed for 5 weeks now, this is making it difficult.  </p>

<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>We have a tons of exciting and enticing rewards to thank you for believing in us and being part of our journey.Take a look below at just some of our rewards:</p>

<h3>Quercus Cooperage</h3>
<p>My name is John Cox and after 25 years of custom interior woodworking I became interested in the art of coopering. Coopering is a historic trade that uses specific joinery to make wooden casks and in that tradition I fabricate handmade barrels and tanks for the craft spirit industry.</p>
<p>Five years ago I found out that due to the boom in craft distilling there was a barrel shortage in America. I went to a local distillery. bought a used whiskey barrel, brought it back to my shop and took it apart. This led me on a journey to discover everything I could about the fading trade of coopering. I quickly realized two things: There was very little information available about process and technique, and the Hudson Valley, where i lived, had a rich and important part in the history of barrel making.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540164860/qoomy1yconflcwjzjfk8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Using antique tools I acquired at auction, I set off on an apprenticeship to become a cooper. At this time i also knew it was important to start buying and milling local White Oak because  a cooper can only use wooden  staves that have air dried for 24 to 36 months. I modified my woodworking machines to replicate the actions of the old  hand tools. I  consulted with other machinists and tinkerer friends, and finally after several attempts successfully held liquid in a wooden barrel.</p>

These upgrades will also allow me to begin to make larger barrels to supply to local vineyards.</p>

</div><div>
<h2>What I need </h2>
<p><br/>When i initially set up the cooperage, it was with rudimentary woodworking machinery. Now that  I am ready to increase production, I need to make improvements and fabricate custom machinery. </p>
<p>  In order to get to Phase 2 Im trying to raise the following funds :</p>
<p>$2,500 - Custom tooling and templates </p>
<p>$2,300-  A new saw to mill our stock </p>
<p>$1,200 - Custom sanding machine for barrels </p>
<p>$2,750 - Custom ring cutter and punch </p>
<p>$10,000 - Wood and Steel reserves for 2019 /2020 </p>
<p>$3,100 - Custom Hoop Driving machine </p>
<p>$3,150 - Payroll funds to hire new apprentice and train <br/> </p>
<h2>What You Get </h2>
<p>I've got some great perks.  From custom engraved Leather Hip Flasks, to small Custom Barrels .</p>
<p>I can print anything you'd like on our small tabletop barrels, from a picture of your dog, to your wedding date. These barrels have a charred interior and can be used to age spirits or just to dispense you're favorite cocktail.</p>
<p>If you really want to age some spirits try one of my small Firkin barrels. This 9 gallon barrel has a charred interior and like all the barrels raised at Quercus is from local White Oak. Tap the Firkin at your next large celebration and serve your own signature cocktail to your guests!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact </h3>
<p>For the last 5 years I've been in a small industrial building tucked away in the mountains . With the success of Phase 2 I can consider the next step which is moving into a larger facility.

<p><strong>We need you. We need your strength and your boldness. We need your donation.</strong></p>
<p>Our business has been creating fertile ground for the last 6 years. We're ready now. Every donation is a seed of liberation planted into this ground. When we meet our goal, a blooming garden of empowerment will be ready to give to our future. </p>
<p>Our coffee company loves perks! (#verypunny.) We have stickers and buttons, and beans, oh yeah, and shout-outs and other swag as well. </p>
<p>Yet our best perk is the feeling you will receive when your voice makes a positive impact in our world.</p>

<p>To scale up and expand we will need to move our production to a partner who specializes in handling large volumes. We've found the perfect partner and are excited to work with them. </p>
<p>With the funds we raise we will be introducing a whole new way to get and experience Mamaleelu through our subscription boxes and bagged coffee line. These new streams of revenue will not only create the liberation of Mamaleelu, but the economic liberation of other women, too.</p>
<p>One person cannot carry the entire load and thrive. This is true on a micro and macro scale, which is why we are asking you to walk with us and help carry the load.</p>
<h3>Where we'll lead</h3>
<ul>
<li>We will consciously curate coffee beans from sources who are economically liberating women</li>
<li>We will use recycled, and reusable/recyclable packaging when possible</li>
<li>We will be be BOLD in our call for equity and humanity</li>
<li>We will curate business from women artists and business owners (for subscription boxes)</li>
<li>We will share our profits with our workers</li>
<li>We will be responsible stewards of our resources</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We’ve been in business for six years and have celebrated many successes along the way:</strong></p>

Greetings, I'm Maliesha, a Strong.Black.Bold Warrior Queen who came here to disrupt the economic oppression of women, and to call in other Matriarchs and friends who wish to do the same.
For six years, Mamaleelu bottles and cans have been hand crafted, packaged, and distributed by one woman, me. Every day that I've been able to create and share my love through coffee has been a blessing and the most challenging thing I've ever done. 
The work that we as a global community do right now will be the future we gift to our children and their children. I want freedom for them, equity for them, humanity for them. If you feel the call of your descendants, and want to gift them a beautiful and liberated human experience...keep reading.

What We Need & What You Get
$33,000 to plant seeds of liberation.
We need to scale-up and it will take $33,000 to do this. Check out the pie chart to see how the funds will be used to scale-up. 

We need you. We need your strength and your boldness. We need your donation.
Our business has been creating fertile ground for the last 6 years. We're ready now. Every donation is a seed of liberation planted into this ground. When we meet our goal, a blooming garden of empowerment will be ready to give to our future. 
Our coffee company loves perks! (#verypunny.) We have stickers and buttons, and beans, oh yeah, and shout-outs and other swag as well. 
Yet our best perk is the feeling you will receive when your voice makes a positive impact in our world.

The Impact of your Voice

To scale up and expand we will need to move our production to a partner who specializes in handling large volumes. We've found the perfect partner and are excited to work with them. 
With the funds we raise we will be introducing a whole new way to get and experience Mamaleelu through our subscription boxes and bagged coffee line. These new streams of revenue will not only create the liberation of Mamaleelu, but the economic liberation of other women, too.
One person cannot carry the entire load and thrive. This is true on a micro and macro scale, which is why we are asking you to walk with us and help carry the load.
Where we'll lead

We will consciously curate coffee beans from sources who are economically liberating women
We will use recycled, and reusable/recyclable packaging when possible
We will be be BOLD in our call for equity and humanity
We will curate business from women artists and business owners (for subscription boxes)
We will share our profits with our workers
We will be responsible stewards of our resources

We’ve been in business for six years and have celebrated many successes along the way:

First black woman to launch a cold brew coffee brand
Simultaneously held down wholesale accounts, a café kiosk, and farmers market booth
Obtained a series of small loans from a local business, and also through the Kiva organization
Featured in publications including, Thrillist, Midwest Living, and many more

<h3>What is Harlem Chocolate Factory?</h3>
<p>We are Harlem’s ONLY chocolate shop and we opened February 14th, 2018 located in the Historic Strivers' Row Neighborhood. We started the business in 2015 selling our Harlem Bars, which is a collection of chocolate bars all wrapped in photographs of Harlem. Our most popular bar is our Champagne on Strivers' Row, 72% dark chocolate with dried currants and popping candies.  </p>
<p> We also sell beautifully painted bonbons, hand-rolled truffles, premium chocolate barks, chocolate turtles, hot chocolate and cookies all handcrafted fresh on the premises.</p>

<h3>Our Mission </h3>
<p> The mission of Harlem Chocolate Factory is to create products that share the rich history and various cultural experiences of Harlem while providing a unique chocolate experience. We aim to make Harlem Chocolate Factory a wonderful place to visit and work, by providing stable livable wages and employing members of the Harlem community. With Harlem in the mist of both a resurgence and demographic change, Harlem Chocolate Factory is a place to bridge the gap.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With the help of this campaign we will be able to add 2 full-time positions and 4 part-time positions of which 2 will transition to full time within 6 months; all at a fair-wage. Unfortunately, many people who have been born and raised in Harlem can no longer live here because of the raise in the cost of living. Six positions may not seem like a lot but it is a place to start. During the summer we hold a 6 week summer internship that provides job training and self confidence building for young girls in the community.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This entire year has been a challenge with managing the store and producing while we are so understaffed. Our biggest threat is space.

<p>Hi! My name is Jacquelyn and I started FERA because I wanted to create a lifestyle brand to help others dealing with debilitating diseases. In high school I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease and it changed my life. I was rail thin, ghostly white, and had no energy. Eating food was too painful. I was put on medication which covered up my disease, but didn't work for long term. I felt helpless.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I changed my lifestyle and started incorporating Moringa into my diet that I could see a light at the end of the tunnel. Through implementing meditation, yoga, a paleo-like diet and lots of moringa, I was able to heal myself and remain in remission for the past 10 years. I want to share my story in the hopes of helping others by providing natural energy and profound nutrition through FERA. </p>

<p>Moringa is one of the most nutrient dense plants on the planet. Moringa powder comes from the young dried leaves of the Moringa tree. Just one serving provides all your nutritional needs including a complete plant protein. </p>

<h2><strong>Why FERA Vitality?</strong></h2>
<p>FERA Moringa powder was so well received I was inspired to do more. I want to create a Moringa based blend that dissolves in water, adds more benefits to the body and is flavorful.

The Vitality blend will enhance focus with less stress, improve memory and help concentration, and stimulate sexual prowess. Because of our busy lifestyles today we need to incorporate FERA Vitality into our diet. </p>
<p>Below are some benefits of each adaptogen.</p>
<p><strong>Rhodiola Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Energy enhancing</li>

<p>I've been incorporating moringa in my food on a daily basis for years now and it's been SO difficult to find a quality product in stores that's just as potent and rich in nutrients as the real moringa leaf. Finally I found FERA! Fera is pure, rich and very potent. You can even smell the powerful moringa scent before opening the bag! I've been adding Fera to my daily smoothies since I discovered it and I definitely feel the benefits of being more energized and less inflammation in my stomach. What's great is that you only need to use a teaspoon a day to benefit from it.</p>

</div></div>","Hi! My name is Jacquelyn and I started FERA because I wanted to create a lifestyle brand to help others dealing with debilitating diseases. In high school I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease and it changed my life. I was rail thin, ghostly white, and had no energy. Eating food was too painful. I was put on medication which covered up my disease, but didn't work for long term. I felt helpless.
It wasn't until I changed my lifestyle and started incorporating Moringa into my diet that I could see a light at the end of the tunnel. Through implementing meditation, yoga, a paleo-like diet and lots of moringa, I was able to heal myself and remain in remission for the past 10 years. I want to share my story in the hopes of helping others by providing natural energy and profound nutrition through FERA. 
 
Your NATURAL All-in-One 
Nutritional Superfood
         

Because NUTRITION = ENERGY
 
 
What is Moringa?
Moringa is one of the most nutrient dense plants on the planet. Moringa powder comes from the young dried leaves of the Moringa tree. Just one serving provides all your nutritional needs including a complete plant protein. 

                                            
 
Why should you worry about your nutritional intake?
Because the average American is missing out on 6 essential nutrients. A shocking 90% of Americans are deficient in Potassium.
 
             
 
FERA Moringa contains high levels of these 6 essential nutrients and over 80 more!
 
What's everyone else saying about Moringa?
 
""THIS SUPER GREEN IS A STRONGER ANTI-INFLAMMATORY THAN TURMERIC"" 
- Well + Good
 
""WE TASTED THE NEXT SUPERFOOD (IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK)""

Nourish Boxes has already created relationships with over 60 Colorado vendors who are ready to fill these boxes with their awesome small-batch products. We will continue add more vendors and their great stuff to diversify the products inside these boxes. Here are some of our favorites, just to name a few:      Discover the Story Behind the Products You UseEach of our boxes has QR codes that link to a video message showing the artisan’s story behind why they devote their lives to making these products. More just delivering products, we want to build a connection between the product makers and the consumers who avail of their products.Most of the vendors who make these products have amazing stories! Hear the story of bee farm vendors and how they use beeswax to make artisan soaps. Or learn about the pregnant woman who was seeking a natural deodorant to avoid excess chemicals during pregnancy but could not find a good brand that worked, inspiring her to create one that does.Most of these amazing vendors have limited market penetration. As a result, they find it hard to sell more of their products. We want to share the stories of these vendors and their products with the entire state of Colorado and beyond!Ultimately, we want customers to be more connected to the brands that they choose. We are also working with vendors that create small-batch products with simpler and cleaner ingredients (hence our name nourish) so we want to promote less junk and more of the good stuff.   We are very picky with the vendors we work with. We only work with artisans who ethically and sustainably get their materials and ingredients. As a result, we get to provide cleaner and more natural products.      The money will also be used to make a top-notch website that can handle a complicated subscription-type order. Funds will also be used to pay our videographer to create high-quality videos that accompany the boxes and products inside.Nourish Boxes is choosing to print all boxes and inserts with Ecoenclose due to the fact that they offer shipping boxes and printables all created from 100% post-consumer recycled products! Designing our boxes with this company and printing them on a large scale will cost a tiny bit more than your standard shipping boxes. But- we think it's worth it. And so does Mother Earth.Additionally, this campaign aims to validate if there’s a market for our idea. Your feedback will help us greatly in this aspect.  Our vision is to strengthen the bond between neighbors and communities. We desire to create a deeper connection throughout the community through the stories of artists and artisans alongside the delivery of their local, hand-crafted, and nourishing goods.The stories behind the people who make these products are what make these things that much more special. From veteran-owned businesses, to goat farmers who make caramel sauces, to entire family businesses, to the parents of a 3-year-old boy who can demolish a plate of hot wings dressed in their hottest craft buffalo sauce, to the quiet single mothers creating organic body care products, or the women managing epilepsy and her Indian heritage-inspired business. The stories behind the people who make these products are nothing short of incredible and inspiring.Typically if you want to be exposed to some of these incredible artisans and their unique products, you’ll have to show up at the right farmers market at the right time of the year, or search hours on social media to find them. Now, Nourish Boxes will bridge the gap between hard-working Colorado artisans and people like yourself.Founder Christina Coblish quickly discovered a massive community in Colorado that produced and sold unique, high-quality, small-batch artisanal products that she quickly fell in love with. She imagined a service that would easily deliver these products to people, along with stories of the people who created them.She has secured relationships with over 60 different Colorado small business vendors that produce over 200 different small-batch goods and products. This service is now coming to life. Nourish Boxes is hitting the ground full speed, bringing these artisanal products out of the farmers market and into your home.  Sustainability is important in Colorado, which is why Nourish Boxes will print their boxes with biodegradable ink on boxes that are made from 100% recycled post-consumer products. This makes the boxes completely recyclable! Everything about Nourish Boxes is Colorado-based, right down to where the boxes are created and printed in Louisville with EcoEnclose.  Nourish Boxes wants to support causes bigger than their own, which is why they intend to partner with and donate a portion of their profits to Green America, a non-profit organization that fights for human labor rights and the sustainable sourcing of materials for both small businesses and large corporations.  Now you can connect with Colorado through their products and their stories with Nourish Boxes.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our aim is to not only build a resilient and positive future for our family on the farm but to rebuild vibrancy into the local dairy industry.  We’ve come a long way to create a bright future for our small, some would say micro, dairy from the depths of despair when the effects of deregulation hit. Hard work and a determination to keep this family property, so rich in history and stories of dedication and passion, thriving for generations to come. We’re ready to take the next step and we’ve been working hard to get there. We see this campaign as a chance for our Friends of the Farm to get involved in the next chapter of our story, to be part of something unique and exciting for our family and yours.  Come, join with us on this journey of provenance, of connection and of true culinary joy. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make our Creamery a reality, we need to raise $70,000. Our Creamery will be a completely mobile, modern facility with a heritage twist in-keeping with our family's history on the farm. We truly believe in buying and supporting local so we're sourcing all local machinery to equip our Creamery including a milk pasteuriser, cream separator, even the Creamery itself.  All of this needs to be to the strictest standards to meet Queensland's SafeFood certification. We've done our research, we know what our customers want and we're ready to jump in, boots n all. Are you ready to don your boots and jump in too??</p>
<p>We have a number of packages based on your level of support. Big or small, your contribution will be greatly appreciated.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe there is a future for dairy farms in Queensland and particularly, for small family farms like ours who diversify their farm business to welcome consumers to connect with their food and the farmers that produce it. Now is the time to build resilient farm businesses to ensure the future of fresh milk production in Queensland. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are one of less than 380 dairy farms left in Queensland. It's a fact that is hard to take but it is very real. By building and running the Creamery, we will be creating unique, single source dairy products fresh from the farm for your enjoyment and creating a sustainable future for our historic family farm.  #knowyourlocalfarmer - you can't get a better connection than that! </span></p>

<h1>The Blade</h1>

<p>The blade of Achilles is formed like a traditional western all-purpose Chef’s knife. It is ideal for all kinds of chopping, slicing, and dicing.</p>
<h1>The Handle</h1>
<div data-id=""20605515""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1526323929/mjul2pfdbkkierrdz5yh.jpg"" src=""""/></p></figure></div>
<p>The Achilles handle is uniquely shaped and fits perfectly into your hand to provide the best possible grip even if your hands or the knife itself is wet.</p>
<div data-id=""20605549""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1526323929/y3vs5etqftmjf1cwuhko.jpg"" src=""""/></p></figure></div>
<p>The most noticeable feature of Achilles is the hole in its handle. It is a point that provides balance and grip to the knife. The hole sits at the knives point of balance and allows you to put a finger into it for optimal pressure distribution while cutting.</p>

<p>Mid last year, we came up with the idea to develop a paring knife and a bread knife based on the Achilles design so we could offer you all a full Achilles series!</p>
<h1>The Paring Knife</h1>
<div data-id=""20190830""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Achilles Paring Knife"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1526323935/c9glystwtcdp1fva0yzv.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption><p style=""text-align: center;"">Achilles Paring Knife</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The paring knife is exactly like the Chef’s knife only smaller. This knife follows the basic design of a Chef’s knife and is ideal for peeling vegetables, cutting fruits and anything else you can think of you would need a smaller knife in your kitchen for.</p>

<p>Since our company was created, we wanted to create a unique knife that reflects the spirit and values of our company. It was only after we teamed up with a talented designer that had his own experiences with knives in the area of gastronomy, that we finally figured out what kind of knife we wanted to create.</p>
<div data-id=""20605625""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""One of our early 3D prints"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1526323942/zydsmwvzeuyxmz9swf3q.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption><p style=""text-align: center;"">One of our early 3D prints</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Our knife had to be durable, practical for professionals and it had to be elegant.</p>
<div data-id=""20605629""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""The designer working on a design variation"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1526323943/acfova7gjooei8vpgncw.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption><p style=""text-align: center;"">The designer working on a design variation</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>We played around with several designs, talked with several professional chef’s and collected their feedback. The result was the idea of creating a knife completely out of metal, no wood or rough textures that allow bacteria to grow, providing high durability and having a very premium look and feel.</p>
<div data-id=""20605635""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1526323943/spqpssofbeijvzs76leg.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Achilles has now been in development for over three years. It all started with 3D-CAD models and 3D printed samples to determine the best grip design and angles so the knife is comfortable and secure to hold for both left and right-handed people.</p>
<div data-id=""20605650""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""3D print next to a prototype"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1526323944/tj24ek59aptsvrhlo9dn.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption><p style=""text-align: center;"">3D print next to a prototype</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>After our first design was created, we met the next challenge: how to properly make a knife out of one solid piece of metal. The picture below shows our final version next to our first prototype that consisted of two parts welded together. You can clearly see the line where blade and handle were joined together.</p>
<div data-id=""20605658""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Final version (left), first prototype (right)"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1526323945/bxtcpzpkjikmhsitkues.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption><p style=""text-align: center;"">Final version (left), first prototype (right)</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>It was only in the last year, that we finally solved this problem with traditional German craftsmanship. The final design is one solid piece of durable stainless steel metal that, if treated well, will last you a lifetime.</p>

<p>During the development period of Achilles, the knife went through several phases of lab and customer tests.</p>

<p>For customer testing, we selected some of our best customers to get an early glimpse of Achilles by participating in our trails. Mr. Fikret Fidan, who has been the Chef of the famous Motorsport Hotel near the „Grean Hell“ the Nürburgring Nordschleife, was very happy with the knife even from the earliest prototype. His feedback and the feedback of the other participants helped us tremendously improve Achilles to the knife that it is today.</p>

The full Achilles knife series
Mid last year, we came up with the idea to develop a paring knife and a bread knife based on the Achilles design so we could offer you all a full Achilles series!
The Paring Knife
Achilles Paring Knife
The paring knife is exactly like the Chef’s knife only smaller. This knife follows the basic design of a Chef’s knife and is ideal for peeling vegetables, cutting fruits and anything else you can think of you would need a smaller knife in your kitchen for.

The Achilles knife series
 

One of our Damascus series knives
Since our company was created, we wanted to create a unique knife that reflects the spirit and values of our company. It was only after we teamed up with a talented designer that had his own experiences with knives in the area of gastronomy, that we finally figured out what kind of knife we wanted to create.
One of our early 3D prints
Our knife had to be durable, practical for professionals and it had to be elegant.
The designer working on a design variation
We played around with several designs, talked with several professional chef’s and collected their feedback. The result was the idea of creating a knife completely out of metal, no wood or rough textures that allow bacteria to grow, providing high durability and having a very premium look and feel.

Achilles has now been in development for over three years. It all started with 3D-CAD models and 3D printed samples to determine the best grip design and angles so the knife is comfortable and secure to hold for both left and right-handed people.
3D print next to a prototype
After our first design was created, we met the next challenge: how to properly make a knife out of one solid piece of metal. The picture below shows our final version next to our first prototype that consisted of two parts welded together. You can clearly see the line where blade and handle were joined together.
Final version (left), first prototype (right)
It was only in the last year, that we finally solved this problem with traditional German craftsmanship. The final design is one solid piece of durable stainless steel metal that, if treated well, will last you a lifetime.
The forging die for Achilles

Lab cutting test of Achilles
During the development period of Achilles, the knife went through several phases of lab and customer tests.
Corrosion test of Achilles in a lab
During the lab tests, Achilles was tested for long-term corrosion effects, cutting ability due to wear and tear, security and durability if it ever falls to the ground or out of your hand. 
Testing sharpness by cutting ropes
Achilles in Gourmet Chef's hand
For customer testing, we selected some of our best customers to get an early glimpse of Achilles by participating in our trails. Mr. Fikret Fidan, who has been the Chef of the famous Motorsport Hotel near the „Grean Hell“ the Nürburgring Nordschleife, was very happy with the knife even from the earliest prototype. His feedback and the feedback of the other participants helped us tremendously improve Achilles to the knife that it is today.

Shortly after its inception, Sternsteiger moved its operational base to the world famous city of Solingen that is known as the city of blades. The city has a tradition of blade forging that is going back at least to the 14th century. This location is the mecca for both traditional and modern makers that work together as a cooperative.The first documented case of forged blades in Solingen is of 1363.
Testing of the die for Achilles in a Solingen forge
In the modern era, its close proximity to the Ruhrgebiet with its coal mines and steel fabrication was a huge advantage.Today the situation has changed, a lot of manufacturers have closed down, because of the competition from Asia and raised costs, but the core infrastructure is still there.

This is why we made the move to Solingen. We are now able to leverage hundreds of years of knowledge and combine it with state of the art technologies, procedures, and designs. The result is what you see before you today.

<p><strong>Steve, the founder behind iRise, has lived and breathed the work hard-play hard lifestyle</strong>. Having lived and travelled in over 70 countries, he has worked both construction and corporate jobs all across the world.</p>
<p>""School nights"" were spent entertaining clients, which often spilled over into drinks. During his construction years he found himself with the guys on site having a few mid-week beers, but yet, had to be sharp in the morning for a roofing job or management situation.</p>
<p>As we all have, Steve tried everything... from a of couple bottles of water and a multi-vitamin before bed, to energy drinks and painkillers in the morning, <b>these old wives tales rumored to cut the grogginess just didn't cut it</b>.</p>
<p>His eureka moment came in 2017 when he was in Munich, Germany after a friend introduced him to a hangover drink. Fascinated by this concoction, he was surprised to find nothing like it in the Australian market!</p>
<p>Determined to introduce this potent goodness to the rest of the world, Steve began waking up at 4am every morning and working late into the night to research the science behind was would soon become iRise.</p>
<p>Recognising he needed skilled and talented people to get this off the ground, he brought together <strong>PhD researchers</strong>, a <strong>herbalist</strong>, a <strong>food technician</strong>, and a team of<strong> business-savvy entrepreneurs</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>iRise was born. </strong></p>

Scientifically formulated, each 100ml bottle is jam-packed with natural ingredients to give your body a boost when you need it most.
iRise was designed for professionals and go-getters who define the work hard-play hard lifestyle. Who said you have to choose between drinks after work and an early morning session at the gym?  With iRise, you can DO BOTH!
 

iRise is full of natural active ingredients. 
With ingredients such as Japanese Raisin Berry, Korean Pear, Milk Thistle and Panax Ginseng, each bottle of iRise is a potent dose to give your body the boost it needs.

This special combination of fruits and herbs gives your liver, gut, and immune system all of the goodness it needs to process the nasty byproducts of alcohol that leave you feeling sluggish and grumpy after a night out.
Drinking a single bottle of iRise before or during a night out will have you feeling fresh and ready to take on the next day! 

Steve, the founder behind iRise, has lived and breathed the work hard-play hard lifestyle. Having lived and travelled in over 70 countries, he has worked both construction and corporate jobs all across the world.
""School nights"" were spent entertaining clients, which often spilled over into drinks. During his construction years he found himself with the guys on site having a few mid-week beers, but yet, had to be sharp in the morning for a roofing job or management situation.
As we all have, Steve tried everything... from a of couple bottles of water and a multi-vitamin before bed, to energy drinks and painkillers in the morning, these old wives tales rumored to cut the grogginess just didn't cut it.
His eureka moment came in 2017 when he was in Munich, Germany after a friend introduced him to a hangover drink. Fascinated by this concoction, he was surprised to find nothing like it in the Australian market!
Determined to introduce this potent goodness to the rest of the world, Steve began waking up at 4am every morning and working late into the night to research the science behind was would soon become iRise.
Recognising he needed skilled and talented people to get this off the ground, he brought together PhD researchers, a herbalist, a food technician, and a team of business-savvy entrepreneurs.
iRise was born. 
 

The formula and science behind iRise has been carefully developed over the past 18 months. With your pre-order, iRise will be giving you peace of mind when choosing to enjoy yourself of a night out without sacrificing tomorrow morning.
iRise has been designed to tick all boxes: no nuts, no gluten, no sugar. Every bottle is packed with multi-vitamins, electrolytes and amino acids.
Just plants, herbs, super fruits and berries, with a tangy passionfruit flavour.
 

 


iRise has already been taken from a dream to a reality. Tens of thousands of bottles have already been manufactured and packaged, just for you! That means your pre-order is stocked and ready to be shipped!
Instead of waiting weeks for production to take place, you will have your pre-order of iRise within weeks!


 

iRise has already been manufactured and is ready to be shipped. By pledging now and pre-ordering, your iRise delivery will be in yours hands shortly after this campaign finishes.

In the same year I was the candidate for the Presidency of the state (being supported by the Green Party and promoting a green progressive agenda).  As an adviser of the Prime Minister for environmental issues and dialog with civil society I successfully pushed for stop hunting of the Lynx Lynx species, the biggest wild cat in Europe (2012). About 100 individuals were on the list to be hunted every year so we saved about 7-800 of these beautiful animals from 2012 to 2019. As a Member of the Parliament (2012 – 2016) I proposed the law to ban the using of animals in circuses and after more three years of campaigning it was voted by parliament which was previously hostile to the idea. Many of the causes which I supported got a wide coverage in the national and international media. I gained a huge experience from different fields which converge all together to maximize the chances of success for this new entrepreneurial project. There are few innovative assets of the Green Vegan: 1. There are many companies which are Green but not Vegan and vice versa. But we have to accelerate the transition to a far more and sustainable Green economy and to reduce as fast as possible the consumption of meat and dairy which are responsible for a big part of the greenhouse emissions.  2. We will provide tasty and healthy Vegan street food in some touristic areas from Romania at the beginning. We'll got the necessary energy from solar panels, so there will be 0 emissions. If the things will go well and there will be a support from donors and investors we will want to extend in other EU countries as soon as possible.3. A consistent part of the profits will go to support the NGOs which fight against the mass killing of the dolphins in places like Taiji (Japan) and Faroe Islands. Other animal rights issues will be considered also to be funded by our company. 4. This campaign is named ""The Generous Vegan"" because we want to use 20% from the donations to cover the prices for the meals which will be offered free to non-Vegans in order to give them a chance to eat a very tasty and healthy Vegan street food. We hope that we'll convince many of them to take into consideration to reduce the consumption of meat and dairy and even to become Vegetarians or vegans. I'm also very proud an happy to announce that my sister, Magda Cernea, who is PhD in medical science and former national champion at chess Under 18 for two times have decided to join to this project.

<p>Salut, </p>
<p>(texte en Français plus bas)</p>
<p>We are Midnight Poutine! For those who never heard of us, we're a Burning Man food camp from the french speaking province of Canada called Quebec.  Since 2009, we've been driving <strong>10 000 km</strong> (6 200 miles) to Black Rock City, NV, to serve poutines to very hungry and eager burners at -surprise- midnight.</p>
<p>But what's poutine?  It's a traditional Quebecois comfort food usually (but not always) eaten after a night of drinking. It’s made from french fries and cheese curds (what is called in Quebecois ""cheese droppings "" ). The whole thing covered with thick brown sauce from ancient family recipes.  After a full day of drinking and partying on the playa this simple dish will blow you away!</p>
<p>Last year, <strong>2000 hungry burners</strong> got a taste of Midnight Poutine. It's a party every night with Québecois music, a burn barrel, sexy people, line-ups around the block, an new and improved open-mic and burlesque stage to entertain the line-up and, of course, poutine! We don't want to leave anybody hungry at BRC :)  </p>
<p>We need your contributions for :</p>
<p><strong>Cheese curds </strong>: Hell yeah, we use REAL cheese curds!  Without cheese we would just have fries and sauce, and we all know how boring that would be.  And it turns out that cheese curds are our biggest expense!!!</p>
<p><strong>The other Ingredients</strong> : This include potatoes, gravy,  and oil  and there's a lot propane to feed our trusty 6 fryers.</p>
<p><strong>The other Logistics </strong>: It takes a lot to set up a food camp, make eating areas, an open-mic stage and decorations, not to mention getting all this stuff to Burning Man from Montreal and renting a storage locker year-round in Reno, NV, for all our other stuff.  'nuff said.  </p>
<p>It cost about <strong>5000$</strong> to serve about 2000 poutines and this excludes our camp's expenses. Some of the financing is done through fundraising events and by us. So that means ALL the money you contribute goes toward running the poutine kitchen! The more money we get, the more poutines we have the pleasure to serve, it's that simple.</p>
<p>Please help us feed our fellow burners in 2018 by funding the best late-night party food camp on the playa.  Thank you all!</p>

<p>Qu’est-ce que la poutine? Il s’agit d’un plat typiquement québécois composé de patates frites et de fromage en grain, communément appelé ""crottes de fromage"", le tout nappé d’une sauce dont la recette est un secret familial bien gardé.  Après une journée complète de fête et de boisson, le goût de nos poutines va faire littéralement ""capoter"" tous les burners.</p>
<p>L’an passé, nous avons offert <strong>2000 poutines</strong> à des burners affamés qui étaient prêt à attendre des heures pour goûter à notre petit plat typique de fin-de-brosse.  Ça devient une fête improvisée a tous les soirs avec de la grosse musique Québécoise, du beau monde sexy, un baril de feu, une immense file d'attente, une scène ouverte ou les gens peuvent monter et divertir ceux qui attendent en ligne et, bien sûr, d'la poutiiiiiiiine!</p>
<p>Nous avons besoin de vos contributions pour : </p>
<p><strong>Les crottes de fromage</strong> : Eh oui, le fromage est sans contredit notre dépense la plus coûteuse mais sans fromage ça ne serait qu’une frite-sauce et on sait bien que c’est plate une frite-sauce.</p>
<p><strong>Les autres ingrédients </strong>: Cela inclut les patates, la sauce, l’huile et aussi le gaz propane pour alimenter nos 6 friteuses adorées.</p>
<p><strong>Les autres logistiques</strong> : À chaque année, nous devons construire notre camp, nos deux cuisines (publique et privée),  la scène améliorée ""open-mic and burlesque stage"" sans compter le transport de notre matériel en camion à partir de Montréal jusqu’à la playa et la location à l'année d'un espace d'entreposage pour le reste de notre stock à Reno, NV. Soyez certains que tout l'argent ramassé servira uniquement aux besoins culinaires de Midnight Poutine.</p>Il nous en coûte environ <strong>5000$</strong> pour servir 2000 poutines et ceci exclut les dépenses de notre campement. Une bonne partie de notre financement est faite grâce à des événements locaux en plus de nos propres contributions. Ainsi, TOUTES les sommes que nous collecterons dans cette campagne serviront uniquement à financer la cuisine.  Plus nous amasserons d'argent, plus de poutines nous aurons le plaisir de servir sur la playa. C'est aussi simple que ça.<br/> <p>Nous vous remercions de bien vouloir nous aider à répéter l’expérience encore une fois cette année. C'est grâce à vous que Midnight Poutine devient un lieu incontournable pour commencer sa soirée à Burning Man 2018. Un gros merci à tous!! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello everybody! We are restaurant Wine Gogh, situated in the center of Chisinau, Republic of Moldova's capital. For those that don't know us yet, we are a small establishment that has a community of wine lovers and aged meat. We are one of the few who tried to age meat, and we are the only ones that had success. Now we serve our guest the best meat and we offer them a variety of wines, including  our own ""Wine Gogh - Red Wine"", a combination of Feteasca Neagra, Cabernet &amp; Merlot. We have a small, but cozy restaurant that in the years of its existence already is part of many families or company's traditions.</p>
<p>As COVID-19 hit us all worldwide very hard, we struggle very much right now. Being a part of small businesses, we are in a very awful situation and we need your SUPPORT! We really much want to reopen after the crisis and we want to get back on our feet a.s.a.p., but without your help we will be most likely unable to do that... </p>
<p>If you help us now by contributing to our cause, you will help save a very loved business, a great restaurant with great food excellent wine choice and very friendly staff. The staff being up to 16 people by number! You will simply make our business go again, and we want that from the bottom of our hearts, because we love the things that we do and we are good at it!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<ul>
<li>Cover the rent (even though our country is in lock down, nothing works, we still are obligated to pay rent).</li>
<li>Pay salaries to our staff.</li>
<li>We have to buy a lot of stuff for the kitchen for reopening. Groceries for the chefs to prepare, etc.</li>
<li>Same thing goes with the bar part, We have to buy supplies. </li>
<li>Then there are the taxes, that as well nobody stopped.</li>
<li>Other expenses that always appear (something to paint, something to fix. buy a new mop, maybe a new uniform for someone or stuff like that)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The main impact would be on our staff and ourselves. As we said earlier, we all love our job, we're devoted to it and to our guest that became very dear as well. Imagine that by helping us achieving our goal, you'd build a bridge to our way back into the business. Our staff wouldn't have to look for a new work place, we would be tearing all apart, instead we will continue the job that we started and we will continue to be the best!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hello everybody! We are restaurant Wine Gogh, situated in the center of Chisinau, Republic of Moldova's capital. For those that don't know us yet, we are a small establishment that has a community of wine lovers and aged meat. We are one of the few who tried to age meat, and we are the only ones that had success. Now we serve our guest the best meat and we offer them a variety of wines, including  our own ""Wine Gogh - Red Wine"", a combination of Feteasca Neagra, Cabernet & Merlot. We have a small, but cozy restaurant that in the years of its existence already is part of many families or company's traditions.
As COVID-19 hit us all worldwide very hard, we struggle very much right now. Being a part of small businesses, we are in a very awful situation and we need your SUPPORT! We really much want to reopen after the crisis and we want to get back on our feet a.s.a.p., but without your help we will be most likely unable to do that... 
If you help us now by contributing to our cause, you will help save a very loved business, a great restaurant with great food excellent wine choice and very friendly staff. The staff being up to 16 people by number! You will simply make our business go again, and we want that from the bottom of our hearts, because we love the things that we do and we are good at it!
 

What We Need & What You Get
We need the investment for following:

Cover the rent (even though our country is in lock down, nothing works, we still are obligated to pay rent).
Pay salaries to our staff.
We have to buy a lot of stuff for the kitchen for reopening. Groceries for the chefs to prepare, etc.
Same thing goes with the bar part, We have to buy supplies. 
Then there are the taxes, that as well nobody stopped.
Other expenses that always appear (something to paint, something to fix. buy a new mop, maybe a new uniform for someone or stuff like that)


The Impact
The main impact would be on our staff and ourselves. As we said earlier, we all love our job, we're devoted to it and to our guest that became very dear as well. Imagine that by helping us achieving our goal, you'd build a bridge to our way back into the business. Our staff wouldn't have to look for a new work place, we would be tearing all apart, instead we will continue the job that we started and we will continue to be the best!
Benefits:

We wouldn't be loosing our jobs.
We wouldn't be loosing our medical insurance
We will continue our mission
You would make us very happy and grateful!

<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>The Height Cafe needs your help.</p>
<p>Against all the odds we've managed to get through our first year. Many hours of hard work, and a lot of love from our regular customers have helped to keep our doors open. Even with all this energy we've hit a speed bump and we're not sure we can get over it without your help. </p>
<p>Our coffee machine is broken and we don't have the money to fix it. </p>
<p>Is The Height Cafe your favourite place to eat in Ennis?</p>
<p>Would you be heartbroken if we closed?</p>
<p>We certainly would be, and instead of letting the pressure of bills suffocate us in silence, we're owning our situation and asking for help. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>We need €2500 to pay for the repair of our coffee machine. After all, what is a café without a coffee machine? </p>
<p>Currently it is sitting on a repair bench and we can't get it back until we pay for it. </p>
<p>We're not just putting the hand out and expecting the good people of Clare to help us out for nothing. We understand that being in business is hard for everyone, and we're not looking for a free leg up. We specifically chose Indiegogo because, in return for donations, people can purchase rewards.</p>
<p>On the right hand column you can see a series of rewards that best suits you as a regular customer, whether that's a batch of 6 teas or coffees, or getting Neil to write a song about you. We invite you to invest in the cafe you love, because you want it to stay open, or to put it another way, you're pre-buying future coffees - we just need the machine to make them!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why Help The Height Cafe?</strong></p>
<p>Obviously we love this quirky little cafe that we opened over a year ago, but why should you?</p>
<p>We strive to cater to lots of dietary needs, not just functionally, but with passion. We have a dedicated vegan menu, a selection of plant-based milks, and vegan desserts. This isn't just tokenism, we're genuinely passionate about offering fresh and tasty food for vegans, vegetarians, and those with specific dietary requirements.</p>
<p>We've been passionate since day one about creating a space that celebrates diversity, in whatever form that takes. We are the only openly LGBTQ-friendly commercial space in Ennis. We fly our flags proudly, sell LGBTQ crafts and artwork, and cherish all of the comments we've had from members of the community who come into the cafe regularly. Visibility is important, especially in a small town in Ireland.</p>
<p>We're not afraid to step outside of the box, whether that's with our decor, our menu, or our politics, it's all authentically from the heart. The Height Cafe is not just another generic cafe, it's the weird little brainchild of people who want to do things differently, </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>It's well known that cafes are notoriously short-lived businesses. It's scary to see them pop up and then disappear. We're aware that we're asking our community to help us stay open in a highly competitive market and fraught economic times. </p>
<p>On the other hand, our business is on the up. We've eked out a niche that's in high demand, and we're looking forward to an even busier Summer Season than we had last year. This was a big expense that we didn't see coming. Just one year into business we don't have the safety net to deal with this rainy day. With the amount of time and money we've already invested it seems like nothing to need €2500 to keep going. But right now, by ourselves, we can't stretch that far. </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We understand that you may not have the cash to contribute. We get it. But you can still help. We need to get the word out there. We will only reach our target if lots and lots of people share this. So even if you can't donate, then please share on whatever platforms you're on.</p>
<p>Also, no donation is too small. That's why we've offered several small rewards as a thank you to anyone who can spare €10. Each donation counts, and genuinely it means the world to us. </p>

It's well known that cafes are notoriously short-lived businesses. It's scary to see them pop up and then disappear. We're aware that we're asking our community to help us stay open in a highly competitive market and fraught economic times. 
On the other hand, our business is on the up. We've eked out a niche that's in high demand, and we're looking forward to an even busier Summer Season than we had last year. This was a big expense that we didn't see coming. Just one year into business we don't have the safety net to deal with this rainy day. With the amount of time and money we've already invested it seems like nothing to need €2500 to keep going. But right now, by ourselves, we can't stretch that far. 
Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that you may not have the cash to contribute. We get it. But you can still help. We need to get the word out there. We will only reach our target if lots and lots of people share this. So even if you can't donate, then please share on whatever platforms you're on.
Also, no donation is too small. That's why we've offered several small rewards as a thank you to anyone who can spare €10. Each donation counts, and genuinely it means the world to us.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>About the Brewery</h3>
<p>Fort Orange Brewing is a small craft brewery opening in Albany, New York.  We are located at 450 North Pearl in Albany’s growing Warehouse District.  Our 7 barrel brewery will produce small batches of beer with a focus on bringing balanced and fresh beers to our taproom.  Initial batches will be served on site in flights, pints, and growler fills. </p>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The idea to open a brewery had been a dream of owners Craig Johnson, Jim Eaton and John Westcott for many years.  In the spring of 2016 we began talking about how to turn our dream into a reality.  Casual brew sessions soon accompanied nights of planning the details of our brewery.  After months of research (and brewing!) we began the process of starting Fort Orange Brewing.</p>

<p>One of our goals with the brewery was to embrace the rich local brewing history of Albany.  The city was home to large and successful breweries in the early stages of American history.  We looked at the fact that Fort Orange was the first permanent settlement in what is now Albany, New York.  Soon after, we had our name.  The shape around our logo depicts the shape of the Fort that was home to a handful of settlers in the 1600’s.</p>

<p>Once our name was finalized it was time to pick our location.  We looked at several buildings in the area before agreeing to rent the location at 450 North Pearl St.  Our location is in the growing warehouse district, home to other craft beverage producers like Nine Pin, Druthers, Albany Distilling and many more.  We wanted to be a part of the growing craft beverage movement and the revitalization of the area and in just a few short months, 450 North Pearl began to feel like home.</p>

 Water flows down into the spinning basket and is pushed through the coffee grounds and filter by gyro force. This is what makes G-Presso truly unique! Unlike any other coffee maker!  Steep the coffee grounds for 4 minutes rotating up to 2500 rpm with cold water (COLDBREW). This pressed extraction process uses centrifugal force to make rich crema. It also enhances sweetness and flavor, which is the main advantage of low temperature extraction, by controlling the water flow and pressure, enabling neat coffee steeping. Our exclusive pads allow quiet extraction by blocking minute vibrations and noise generated during cold brew steeping and are a hygienic resting place for components such as the filter basket.Adopting 3 AA-type batteries which are available to use safely and easily anywhere in the world, it’s portable to carry anywhere such as home, the office, and outdoors. Utilizing magnetic levitation technology, friction from spinning is minimized, so the battery sustains longer, making it an efficient coffee maker.(※ 100 times of steeping is available using 3 AA-type batteries / Different according to battery brands) Activated when the control stick upper panel is touched with ‘one touch,’ and the blue LED flashes, automatically stopping after four minutes.

Depending on the amount of water used for extraction, the operation time can be paused when the user desires.(※When 150ml is steeped, the spinning stops after touching it for one second after extracting for 3 minutes)    Extract water through a simple and hygienic way by using the lid to turn the control stick closed, then turn slightly in the open direction to allow water through the micro channels. Using the milk whisk, which combines with the control stick through magnetism, various menus containing milk such as lattes and cappuccinos can be made.Any possibilities of external air contamination is minimized through an organically-combined structure, also the rich taste and flavor are maintained during the process. Especially, it has no suspected environmental hormone bisphenol-A (BPA Free) using the eco-friendly, sanitary material Tritan, making it safe, durable and heat resistant. (Filter basket’s PE lid only)Through a triple bonding microfilter using stainless materials with excellent resistance against corrosion and acidity, it inhibits the extraction of any redundant fine particles and reduces the negative extracts to give you neat, body-rich coffee flavor and taste.   01. Cleaning02. Grinding the Beans03. Putting the Ground Beans in the Filter Basket        (Up to top boundary line of the filter)04. Making the Ground Beans Evenly and Patting them        (Using Tampers)05. Combining the Upper Water Tank and Control Stick06. Placing the Filter Basket on the Central Tower of the Server07. Combining the Upper Water Tank with the Server08. Pouring Water in the Water Tank and Closing the Lid        (Check the lid closed before pouring water)09. Turning the Lid Open after Touching the Power Button        (wait for 5 seconds)10. Start G-PRESSO Steeping- Adjusting the coffee grind and the amount of water changes the taste depending on your  preference.- The amount of ground beans can be adjusted between 28 and 32grams, and depending  on the amount and the roasting strength, there may be a change in flavor. Our company was established in March 2016.We secured two National New Excellent Technology (NET) awards by researching and developing shock wave cleaning technology and electro-degradation sterilization technology and developed a sterilizing device (SPARKLIN) for the beverage distribution system using this technology and automatic sterilization of non-contact harmful bacteria (Blue Aile).Currently, products are mass-produced and marketed for commercialization of our magnetic levitation centrifugation-type coffee extractor (G-PRESSO) that has been subsequently researched to advance into the global coffee market.As mentioned above, our company aims to secure 60 intellectual property rights at home and abroad through continuous R&D and to grow into a global unicorn company by developing new products for food hygiene safety management and national health promotion. What is the most type of water to use?Coffee is made up of 98% water and about 2% coffee. It is recommended to use water purified or bottled water for making delicious cold brew. What is the most suitable temperature?G-presso can extract coffee at different temperatures (59°F to 194°F) from cold water to hot water.Each cup of cold and hot coffee has its own unique flavor, so you can make it according to your taste. How is coffee extracted at high temperatures different from coffee extracted at low temperatures?- Coffee extracted at low temperatures loses its bitterness and becomes rich in sweetness. So the sweetness of the acid-deficient softness makes coffee harmonious.The method has a slower oxidation rate than the hot extraction method and has no heat-induced deformation.- At high temperatures, the flavor of coffee is quickly oxidized.Because of rapid oxidation, we make delicious coffee with a combination of acidity, sweetness, and bitterness. What kind of beans should I use?The taste of coffee depends on the type of beans, roasting strength, and the grinding sizes.Please use good-quality coffee beans and refer to the recommended grinding size diagram(0.3~0.8mm/moka pot grinding chart)Higher than ‘high roasting’ is recommended when it comes to roasting. What would be the proper ratio of coffee to water when mixing them?Please adjust depending on your preferences. You can extract 3 to 4 servings when extracting 200ml.Per serving basis, 150ml / Coffee concentrate 40ml + Water 110ml (4 servings)Per serving basis, 200ml / Coffee concentrate 50ml + Water 150ml (3 servings) How should I clean G-Presso?Simply remove the cap from the filter-basket. Shake out the coffee grounds, and then run a hot water cycle with the filter-basket cap removed. This will remove any trace of coffee oil.",32.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>What Does Celebration Sound Like?</h3>
<p><strong>The pop of a champagne cork!</strong> POP Culture Champagne Bar is the perfect antidote to a tumultuous 2020 – a bright, casual champagne bar, where <strong>the sound of popping corks never stops</strong>, and people can gather to toast our collective return to life, together. POP Culture Champagne is what Kirkland needs at this moment. After over a year of turmoil, Kirkland needs a space that is inviting, relaxing and <strong>offers the best champagne and sparkling wines</strong> around. There is nothing on the eastside that compares to what POP Culture will offer. </p>
<p>With an extensive list of champagne and sparkling wines <strong>to satisfy every palate and budget</strong>, POP Culture is here to serve our beloved community. You can expect to be greeted and waited upon by a warm staff that make up our small - but passionate - establishment. Ownership has created an enthusiastic atmosphere that will transmit to our guests and wine club members.</p>
<p><strong>We will offer flights, glass pours and bottles</strong> of Champagne and sparkling wines in a comfortable, fun and welcoming environment. Our sparkling wines (as well as still wines and beer) will be paired with fun, simple food dishes (think: potato chip bar! also: charcuterie plates, cheese plates and candy bar). We will also offer tiered <strong>sparkling wine clubs</strong>, with something for everyone's tastes and wallet!</p>
<p>We are going to be spending some quality time together, and it is our joy to create a playful and comfortable sanctuary for you. POP Culture’s mission is to share our love of champagne with our community, but not take ourselves too seriously. To create many fantastic memories together in the town that we love  – cheers!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong>: While we have some starter funding, to really make POP Culture the space we want to present to Kirkland, we are respectfully asking for some supplemental contributions to really make it sparkle!</p>
<p><strong>What You Get</strong>: Passion and commitment, hands down. Oh, and BUBBLES, of course! Champagne and Sparkling Wines are not a job, but a lifestyle. We want the community to have a place that is comfortable and unpretentious. Where you can learn and laugh. We want to share our bubbly enthusiasm with the world... and not take ourselves too seriously. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Pop culture is a theme that will resonate in many ways with our patrons, it encompasses music, movies, social media and entertainment of all types. This will resonate with anyone with a pulse. <strong>Whether you prefer Marilyn Monroe or Marty McFly, we all love our pop culture</strong>. We’ll serve amazing bubbles and keep our clientele’s senses enthralled through sight, sound and taste. Also, <strong>there is nothing like POP Culture on the Eastside</strong>, a dedicated sparkling wine bar. We feel that we will be filling a niche that Kirklanders have been missing out on! We want to be the go-to place for all of your big - and small - celebrations. Bachelorette party? Date night? Celebrate making it through that workout? You got you! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We realize that it's been a really, really tough time for small businesses, especially <i>starting</i> one right now. But we are <strong>hopeful that our community will rally around a new spot to gather, started by one of their own</strong>. Also, the space we have procured is fairly small for social distancing by large numbers of people, but we are hopeful that most will be vaccinated by the time we open our doors this summer, when we can all gather + celebrate safely together again! </p>

<h3>So What's It All About?</h3>
<p>Hi folks, I'm Peter Skelton, an expat Brit living in the US, following my passion to open up my very own brewery and pub here in Valdese, NC. I've wanted to start a brewery for a good few years, and once I found myself living in Valdese, I knew that this was the place to do it.</p>
<p>Tucked into the foothills of the Appalachians, Valdese is a great little community full of friendly people, so naturally it's crying out for a pub. Pubs are where friends are met, ideas sparked, philosophies born and where revolution foments. Valdese is a town born from its own unique history and ties, and as I have my own unique history and ties I'm just the man for the job.</p>
<h3>How Can You Help?</h3>
<p>So far I have my location secured and most of my brewhouse is here too. I am looking to raise money to cover the outstanding costs of construction in the building, install a couple of other necessary pieces of equipment - a high power hot water heater and walk in refrigerator - and buy furniture like tables and chairs.</p>
<p>I am setting my target at $12,000, which breaks down as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>$3,000 for construction work</li>
<li>$2,000 for the water heater and associated plumbing</li>
<li>$3,000 for the walk in refrigerator</li>
<li>$2,000 to fulfil perks</li>
<li>$1,000 to buy furniture</li>
<li>$1,000 for legal assistance with ABC permitting</li>
</ul>
<p>I've been lucky enough to meet a lot of excited folks in person, so there's a possibility that we might go past our target. In this case, I will be able to purchase a small can filler sooner than currently planned, so you'll be able to get our beer to go in cans, and I should be able to get my live music plans going faster as well.</p>
<p>As for the perks, if you're anything like local the best of the bunch is the Mug Club membership. You'll get your own personal numbered pint glass which we store for you, early access to special release beers, invites to members only events and possibly some other cool stuff which I haven't thought of yet. If you want to be a part of the inside club, this is the way to do it.</p>
<p>A lot of the perks include T-shirts. Now T-shirts will be on sale as part of our regular merchandise, but the shirts we're offering through here are exclusive and will literally never be offered again to anyone ever. They will be specially designed to make it clear that you not only support us, but supported us from the very beginning for the ultimate in bragging rights.</p>
<p>Like the shirts, the custom glasses will also be a one of a kind item, specially made so you can show your support. And as we have our glassware sandblasted rather than printed, the sign of your support will not age or fade, but will stand the test of time.</p>
<p>If you have your own aspirations of a career in professional brewing, then maybe our option to come and brew your beer on our pilot system is for you. You'll get to bring one of your own recipes (within reason - if you need ten pounds of Nelson Sauvin then we'd need to talk), we'll scale up the recipe, brew a batch on our pilot system and put the beer up for sale in our tap room. It'll be great fun for us, for you and for all your friends to come and see - and taste - the end results.</p>
<h3>What Difference Will You Make?</h3>
<p>Throughout this project it has been a focus of mine to do business with local providers whenever I can. For example, I have been working with the folks at the Valdese Stitchery to design and produce our T-Shirts, as I strongly believe in spending my money locally and investing into my own community.</p>
<p>If you support me in this campaign, you will be helping me realise a years long dream, getting yourself involved in a community based and focused effort to bring an awesome new public space into Valdese, and possibly most importantly you'll be allowing me to follow this career path to support my own young family. </p>
<p>By supporting and championing local business, you keep your money in your own local economy where it does the most good, essentially you invest in the place you live and make it better for yourself and your neighbours and together we all succeed. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that not everyone can chip in with cash but there's other ways that you can help us out and help us reach our goal</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're not already following us on Facebook, then please like our page and share it with your friends! It's the best place to keep up with our news and events as they happen</li>
<li>If you like to follow along with our story in pictorial fashion, follow us on Instagram, @theleveepub and get snapshots as we work towards opening day and beyond!</li>
<li>Tell everyone you know about us and what we're doing and ask them to check us out here and on Facebook!</li>

<p>In October of 2016 we introduced our fermented and cultured cashew Mozzarella to a local health food store. They loved it and added us to their lineup. We then attended our first farmer's market and sold out weekly! On July 30th, 2017 we opened the first Vegan Cheese and Butcher Shop in Connecticut. The response was overwhelming. We had over 1000 people turn up on opening day and we sold out within hours. We had to close down the shop for a week just to restock.</p>
<p>Since then we've been hard at work scaling up our production so that we can meet the demand for our products.<br/><br/>We have some pretty big plans for expansion which is why we've turned to Indegogo (and awesome people like you) for help.</p>

<p>Our objective at Three Girls Vegan Creamery is to produce organic, wholesome, real food without tricks or gimmicks, of course using our Italian roots. We make healthy planet friendly meat and cheese alternatives that are accessible to omnivores, vegetarians and vegans. We simply want to provide wholesome Italian food for everyone to enjoy. </p>
<p>We are currently unable to produce enough product to meet demand. We are looking for capital to help scale up our business and increase our production capacity.</p>
<p>Our lineup now includes 15 meat varieties and 15 cheeses. All the recipes are created by us! </p>

We have met with the plumber, electrician, builder, HVAC and Floor expert. We have the estimates and now need to complete the work.

<p><strong>Increase Production</strong><br/>We have a great team that is working tirelessly to make some of the tastiest meat and cheese alternatives out there. We want to outfit them with some new equipment to help speed up production as well as hire and train a few new team members!</p>
<p><strong>Develop New Products</strong><br/>We have a book of 800 vegan recipes that we have created over the years. We would love to add to our lineup. We need to look into acquiring some special ingredients and equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Expanded Distribution</strong><br/>We've had requests for our products from all across North America. We would love to stock our products in small local businesses close to you. In order to do this we need to bring our cost of production down so that we can afford the retailer margins (usually 30%-40%). To do this we need to buy our ingredients in larger quantities as well as get a few new pieces of machinery that will speed things up a bit.<br/><br/>                          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536716406/vquruvkjl3zinqn8ylbz.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>College was (and is) some of the best years – I loved the social aspect and the fun that came with making new memories and having unique experiences!  After working hard (and of course playing hard) I was fortunate to land a great job after college and shortly afterwards went back for my MBA.   From there, I had a lightbulb go off for an idea that would combine some of my favorite college years with everything I had learned about business thus far.  That colorful idea quickly became a real-life concept, so I started my own LLC and brought it to life – and now we have this beautifully designed mermaid beer bong that functions even better than imagined!  Throughout the hopes and frustrations, along with jumping up and down with ""can this be real life?!"" excitement, it's been one heck of a journey... and it's only just the beginning!  We couldn't be more hopeful and excited to finally launch the Merbonga!!!</p>

College was (and is) some of the best years – I loved the social aspect and the fun that came with making new memories and having unique experiences!  After working hard (and of course playing hard) I was fortunate to land a great job after college and shortly afterwards went back for my MBA.   From there, I had a lightbulb go off for an idea that would combine some of my favorite college years with everything I had learned about business thus far.  That colorful idea quickly became a real-life concept, so I started my own LLC and brought it to life – and now we have this beautifully designed mermaid beer bong that functions even better than imagined!  Throughout the hopes and frustrations, along with jumping up and down with ""can this be real life?!"" excitement, it's been one heck of a journey... and it's only just the beginning!  We couldn't be more hopeful and excited to finally launch the Merbonga!!!

Our commitment is to use only trustworthy ingredients we can be proud of. </p><p>Coconut is packed with MCTs (a special type of healthy saturated fat that drives ketone production for quick energy) and almonds are full of healthy monounsaturated fats. These are among the cleanest energy sources imaginable. </p><p>Chicory root fiber is a non-digestible soluble fiber that has no impact on blood glucose. Unlike some fibers (like tapioca fiber syrup), chicory root doesn't get absorbed or digested as carbohydrate. This means it won't kick you out of ketosis.

<p>Title: The Next Chapters of Our story</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We told you the story of how we started, and what Billy and I (or what Mandy and I) are passionate about coffee, delicious food, and adventure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’d like to continue to tell you the story of how small business owners always have challenges, no matter how successful or profitable they may be. We’ve learned our lessons in this incredible adventure, and Billy and I just closed our most challenging chapter: The fight to survive.</p>
<p>For years, we’ve relied on our community for support, and we owe it to you to be transparent. Here’s what we’ve been up against:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the last few years, we’ve been in a dispute with the landlords at our Osuna location.  We’ve only recently resolved our differences but, unfortunately, the dispute lead to our decision to close our downtown location which helped us to refocus and offset our legal fees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With the continued journey came more peril, and the fight to survive ended with the closure of our Osuna location after a year of disputing. We’d love to stay within that community, but as part of the resolution, we can’t. Our last day at the Osuna location was March 28th.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Due to legal reasons, we will also be re-branding. We will be moving forward as the “Burrow Cafe”</p>

We told you the story of how we started, and what Billy and I (or what Mandy and I) are passionate about coffee, delicious food, and adventure.
 
We’d like to continue to tell you the story of how small business owners always have challenges, no matter how successful or profitable they may be. We’ve learned our lessons in this incredible adventure, and Billy and I just closed our most challenging chapter: The fight to survive.
For years, we’ve relied on our community for support, and we owe it to you to be transparent. Here’s what we’ve been up against:
 
For the last few years, we’ve been in a dispute with the landlords at our Osuna location.  We’ve only recently resolved our differences but, unfortunately, the dispute lead to our decision to close our downtown location which helped us to refocus and offset our legal fees.
 
With the continued journey came more peril, and the fight to survive ended with the closure of our Osuna location after a year of disputing. We’d love to stay within that community, but as part of the resolution, we can’t. Our last day at the Osuna location was March 28th.
 
Due to legal reasons, we will also be re-branding. We will be moving forward as the “Burrow Cafe”
 
The good news is, we have survived.  We are rebuilding and we can’t do it without our community behind us. Today, we need you guys more than ever, to help the Burrow continue to be a labor of love. Consider this our new chapter called - The community and The Burrow.
 
We have the rare opportunity for our story to continue. Through the kindness of investors that heard our story, they want to see us expand to three stores within two years. They see the value we bring and the community we’ve built around our humble shop. We hope you have the same vision as they do.
 
The hardest part of a small business owner’s story is always raising capital. As you saw, we never raised capital before, but now, we’re going outside of our comfort zone to try.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The first HIGH PROTEIN SUPERFOOD pasta now also gluten-free!</h2>
<p>Alver is the first brand to have started creating healthy and sustainable foods with Golden Chlorella®. Golden Chlorella® is a fully patented micro-algae discovered by Mine Uran - a world renowned authority on proteins - in 2016.  </p>
<p>But today the Alver family is expanding! After gathering numerous feedbacks of our customers, on offering a gluten-free pasta, it was time for us to listen!<br/> <br/>After months of trials, development and formulation we came up with the Rigatoni we are proud to present to the market. Gluten is now naturally out of this version, yet one thing remains: pasta has never been that healthy!<br/> <br/>Our high protein superfood Rigatoni are exactly what YOU NEED to live a healthy life despite being busy!</p>

<h3>Family, Community, Craft Beer!</h3>
<p>Hello! We are Jim and Deborah Lewis, founders of Fort Walton Brewing Company. We are Fort Walton's first true Nano Brewery as we utilize a 2 BBL Electric Brewing System. Our goal is 2 fold. First, to bring our small batch, big flavor brews to our friends and neighbors in the area, and Second, to help aspiring brewers get their feet wet on our system and bring their beers to the public in our taproom.  Like a incubator! We want to help the craft beer scene in the Florida Panhandle explode and help new breweries grow their ideas and hopefully have more breweries here in the future benefiting all craft beer fans. Our brewing focus will be on hand crafted, artisanal, and seasonal beers. We want something new on tap every time you visit! We will do a number of things to support local Non Profits and our Local Military. Being a Navy Veteran and a member of this great community since 1987, we love this area and it shows in our enthusiasm. You can help us and be a part of this great little jewel for Fort Walton Beach!</p>
<p>We already have our brewing systems and building, we are hoping to have the Taproom opened mid March to early April. We don't want our taproom to be about our beer but about community in appreciation of good beer everywhere!  Licensing has started and we should be able to serve our own beers as soon as May / June 2018.  Just have to wait for TTB Approval!  We are looking to raise $5000 for upgrades in the taproom and brew house. Below is a summary of projects the funds will go to.</p>
<ul>
<li>Beer Garden furniture</li>
<li>Upgrade our draft system</li>
<li>Taproom and Beer Garden Lighting</li>
<li>Taproom Flooring</li>
<li>Serving Bar </li>
<li>Glassware (we plan on serving in the correct style glass at the taproom!)</li>
<li>Other upgrades to Taproom </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>We have lots more ideas and fun stuff depending on fund raising totals. Anything will help, and if we raise more you can have a say in what we do to upgrade your experience at our brewery!</p>
<p>Our perk package is something for anyone and everyone! Lots of great packages and some limited offers also. You are helping us bring this to Fort Walton and we want to make sure we show you how much we appreciate and value your trust and enthusiasm to see us open! </p>

<p><strong>When do I take Bibi?</strong><br/>Nightcap - while you drink or before you go to bed<br/>Morning After - when you wake up and feel rough :)<br/>Lighten Up - 30 minutes before drinking alcohol and repeat as necessary</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can I take more than one at a time/per night?</strong><br/>Yes, it is common for users to take Lighten Up before drinking and Nightcap afterwards or a Morning After the next day. One Nightcap should be sufficient to prevent a hangover but you can drink a second bottle or drink Morning After the next morning. We recommend limiting it to 2 per night only because there is a large amount of vitamins in each drink, and taking more than that can upset sensitive stomachs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who is the 120 bottle pack for?​</strong><br/>Party animals! JK...If you are an event, wedding planner, or social chair, this is a great product to offer your clients/guests. It's an easy up-sell and they will love to give it to their guests. If you have a wedding, bachelor(ette) party, or corporate event coming up. If you lead a fraternity this will arrive just in time for rush week!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is DHM?</strong><br/>DHM comes from a plant called Oriental Raisin Tree which is native to parts of Asia. This ingredient helps your body flush out acetaldahyde, the toxin that causes headaches, fatigue, anxiety, and nausea that are common to hangovers. It has been clinically shown to prevent hangovers and is the most powerful hangover preventing plant in the world.</p>
<p><br/><strong>What is Milk Thistle?</strong><br/>A powerful plant that cleanses out toxins from your liver and supports healthy liver function. It gives your liver a break so it doesn't have to break down toxins like acetaldehyde all by itself.<br/><br/><br/><strong>What is Activated Charcoal?</strong><br/>A fine powder made from coconut shells that is activated at high heat which creates pores in the powder that absorb toxins and impurities. It is a fast acting detoxifying ingredient in Morning After.<br/><br/><strong>What is 5-HTP?</strong><br/>5-HTP is naturally produced by your body and works in your brain and central nervous system by increasing the production of seratonin (your happy chemical).  We put 5-HTP in Morning After to help drinkers recover mentally and physically the next day.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Are these drinks FDA approved?</strong><br/>Our drinks are considered supplements so the FDA requires our packaging and labeling to be FDA compliant, which they are! Our drinks are produced in a facility that is audited regularly by the FDA and is CGMP (Current Good Manufacturing Practicer) Certified which is regulated by the FDA. <br/><br/><br/><strong>Can I fly with Bibi?</strong><br/>Yes! Each bottle is only 2 ounces/59 ml so is TSA compliant. You can easily fit them in your pocket or purse and take when you go out.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Is Bibi Natural?</strong><br/>YES! We do not use any artificial flavors or sweeteners, and use no coloring in our drinks. Other hangover products cannot claim this. Bibi is also made in the USA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is this for light drinkers?</strong><br/>Yes! Whether you have a few drinks or 10, alcohol takes a toll on your body. Bibi Beverages are the go-to detox drink for any drinking occasion.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Are there any side effects I should know about?</strong><br/>The large amounts of Vitamin B6 and B12 can make your pee more yellow in color :) Morning After contains activated charcoal which has a gritty texture. </p>
<p><br/><strong>How do I store these?</strong><br/>They are shelf stable and last for 1 year. You can also keep them in your fridge, handbag, or nightstand so they are ready for you when you need them!</p>

If so, you are part of a group of people who metabolize alcohol faster than average and therefore produce more acetaldahyde (a toxin). This condition is very hard on your liver because it has to work overtime. Lighten Up will aid your liver and help it flush out toxins more quickly AND prevent these uncomfortable symptoms.</p>

<p>Bryce Distillery is a startup absinthe distillery, born of fun and passion three years ago at a community apple-pressing in Missoula, Montana. Since then, we've put all of our efforts toward creating the finest spirits using our creativity and our training in tradition.</p>
<p>This campaign will scale our absinthe production while reducing, recycling, and re-using the byproducts of distillation.</p>
<p>Contributions will also build our tasting room which will host murder mystery parties and live jazz, and provide a relaxing and vivacious community space for the absinthe-curious and the absinthe-serious. Meeting our target, we'll put Bryce Distillery on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Good karma. You got this and we got you.</p>
<h3>Products</h3>
<p>We're starting off with two top shelf products: an absinthe blanche called Frosted Fairy and an absinthe verte called Anonymous. We just have one question: white or green?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512714131/g2hcxtwnv4herkm4tszv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Note: our recipes do not use any coloring, flavoring, oils, or extracts. The blanche does not contain any star anise, and the verte contains a small amount for flavor. Both recipes are primarily wormwood and green anise.</i></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.brycedisitllery.com/white"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FROSTED FAIRY</a>: 66% ABV/132 PROOF<br/>Absinthe was banned in Switzerland on October 7th 1910, following a gruesome murder. But the people of Val de Travers – a Swiss valley community – never stopped drinking it. During the 97 year ban, residents took to the underground, producing clear absinthe that would not be identified as the green fairy by inquisitive authorities. We traveled here to humbly learn these exquisite recipes and traditions that capture the spirit of Val de Travers: the place where absinthe was born and where it will never die.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512714915/ferux8wcqacbgljmn4h6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Bryce Distillery is excited to announce our collaboration with <a href=""http://www.dryhillsdistillery.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dry Hills Distillery</a> in Bozeman, who will be supplying our neutral spirits from 100% Montana-grown grain! This will be the base of our absinthe. We infuse botanicals like grand wormwood (<i>Artemesia absinthium</i>) and hyssop, and herbs and spices like anise seed and coriander, with the neutral spirits, then distill. The result is a primarily anise-flavored drink that is both rich and refreshing.

<p>For tastings, we only serve our absinthe one way: with water. The nuanced flavors and aromas of a fine absinthe remain bound to the alcohol molecule until the beverage is diluted slowly, and they are released.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Our backers love creativity and community</strong>! With the support from this campaign, Bryce Distillery will begin producing our world-class absinthe this spring using local ingredients and sustainable methods, and we will be distributing to a location near you. We will open the doors of an unforgettable tasting room in beautiful downtown Missoula that promotes conversation, creativity, and community.</p>
<p><strong>Our backers help conserve our most precious resource</strong>! With the water saved through your contributions, we will save enough water to fill an Olympic swimming pool in the first two years, and the savings will only increase exponentially as we produce more and increase our efficiency and technology. In the future, we can fund studies to make this the standard in the distilling industry to reduce our impact on our most precious resource: water.</p>
<p><strong>Our backers help solve world hunger</strong>! If our ideas for blockchain implementation became the standard for food distribution, we would see less food wasted and more distributed to the places where people are hungry. Not only that, but healthy food would become more accessible and affordable for everyone worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>All in all, this campaign will create the change in the distilling industry that will help us realize the future that we all want to live in</strong>.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary

Bryce Distillery is a startup absinthe distillery, born of fun and passion three years ago at a community apple-pressing in Missoula, Montana. Since then, we've put all of our efforts toward creating the finest spirits using our creativity and our training in tradition.
This campaign will scale our absinthe production while reducing, recycling, and re-using the byproducts of distillation.
Contributions will also build our tasting room which will host murder mystery parties and live jazz, and provide a relaxing and vivacious community space for the absinthe-curious and the absinthe-serious. Meeting our target, we'll put Bryce Distillery on the blockchain.
Good karma. You got this and we got you.
Products
We're starting off with two top shelf products: an absinthe blanche called Frosted Fairy and an absinthe verte called Anonymous. We just have one question: white or green?

Note: our recipes do not use any coloring, flavoring, oils, or extracts. The blanche does not contain any star anise, and the verte contains a small amount for flavor. Both recipes are primarily wormwood and green anise.
FROSTED FAIRY: 66% ABV/132 PROOFAbsinthe was banned in Switzerland on October 7th 1910, following a gruesome murder. But the people of Val de Travers – a Swiss valley community – never stopped drinking it. During the 97 year ban, residents took to the underground, producing clear absinthe that would not be identified as the green fairy by inquisitive authorities. We traveled here to humbly learn these exquisite recipes and traditions that capture the spirit of Val de Travers: the place where absinthe was born and where it will never die.

ANONYMOUS: 55% ABV/110 PROOFA tale, an era of wealth, despair, and art, this is the spirit behind the drink that hails from the hands of Van Gogh, Picasso, Hemingway – the skygazers who sketched an era and hardly remembered any of it. We followed the footsteps of these iconic artists through the great absinthe cafés of Paris and came up with a recipe that captures the freeform spirit of the times. 

Bryce Distillery is excited to announce our collaboration with Dry Hills Distillery in Bozeman, who will be supplying our neutral spirits from 100% Montana-grown grain! This will be the base of our absinthe. We infuse botanicals like grand wormwood (Artemesia absinthium) and hyssop, and herbs and spices like anise seed and coriander, with the neutral spirits, then distill. The result is a primarily anise-flavored drink that is both rich and refreshing. We color our absinthe verte with botanicals including chlorophyll-rich petit wormwood, mint and lemon balm to give it a distinct and pleasing emerald glow. Many of our herbs are grown in home gardens and community gardens in Missoula, Montana: The Garden City. 
For tastings, we only serve our absinthe one way: with water. The nuanced flavors and aromas of a fine absinthe remain bound to the alcohol molecule until the beverage is diluted slowly, and they are released. There are other ways to enjoy absinthe, including some famous absinthe cocktails which we will also offer at distillery events, but there is no better way than the traditional serving method to immerse yourself in the creamy botanical tide of great absinthe.
If you're unfamiliar with the absinthe ritual, we have included some educational material. We also highly recommend heading over to the Wormwood Society Facebook Page. If it's not on there, you don't need to know it! 
 
Sustainability
Bryce Distillery is using almost entirely repurposed materials for the buildout of our space. Our backers enable us to take the heat generated through distillation and put it to use. Modeling our methods and technologies largely after Stillwagon Distillery, we build a copper pipe system to run the hot water through the tasting room, creating heat in the winter. The cooled water will deposit into holding totes where it will be re-used to cool our still again. The spent water will then be finally repurposed to water our indoor plants. We can still do better. Imagine a self-sustaining distillery. Want to know more? We got you. Our backers are the first to hear the latest updates.
Blockchain
BOOZECOIN is the official coin of Bryce Distillery. It is completely useless and has zero value, and we're giving away 100,000 BOOZE to anyone with a BitShares account. Though BOOZECOIN is completely useless now, blockchain tokens have many use cases like reward points and passes to exclusive distillery events. 
Given the chance, we will staff a small team who can further develop this technology into something that can be applied to Bryce Distillery and other businesses.

What We Need & What You Get
Good karma. Here is a list of where our money will go. If we don't get all the funds we anticipate, the first thing on the list will be funded, then the next, and so on.

$96,000: This increases production capacity with a water and energy-conscious production system. Here is a picture of our 100 gallon still, manufactured by Still Dragon USA!

Given the right technology, our unique system will reduce water waste by 80%, heat waste by 50%, and organic waste by 100%!
$30,000: Buildout of the local tasting room

A cozy, well-lit speakeasy where community and conversation inspire. Given the necessary funds, this is the future of our tasting room. Bryce Distillery hosts private and public events such as murder mystery parties and live jazz. The ideal absinthe-sipping environment. We got you.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">We prepare the masa for our tortillas from locally sourced, organic corn, using the ancient method of nixtamalization developed by the Mesoamerican peoples.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">We are very excited about our venture and feel that you will be too! Our tortillas are very unique and amazing!!!  Our tortillas are different then most because they are made from whole dry corn.   We purchase our corn directly from a local farmer who is certified organic.  We have only been able to find two other small businesses like ours.   Most tortillas you find today are made from masa harina or masa flour, processed in a factory from Genetically Modified Corn.    </h3>

We are a small family run, family owned business in Nelson County, Virginia.  We are passionate about living our life simply and getting back to basics.  That has led us to create the most natural, nutritious tortillas you will find!!                                                              
We prepare the masa for our tortillas from locally sourced, organic corn, using the ancient method of nixtamalization developed by the Mesoamerican peoples. This process involves soaking the corn in lime or Cal (calcium hydroxide) to loosen the hulls, thereby greatly increasing its nutrient content. Nixtamalization is also what gives our tortillas the wonderful, earthy, corn aroma and flavor they are known for. 
We are very excited about our venture and feel that you will be too! Our tortillas are very unique and amazing!!!  Our tortillas are different then most because they are made from whole dry corn.   We purchase our corn directly from a local farmer who is certified organic.  We have only been able to find two other small businesses like ours.   Most tortillas you find today are made from masa harina or masa flour, processed in a factory from Genetically Modified Corn.    
We currently sell our tortillas at the Nelson County Farmers market and Rebecca's Natural Foods in Charlottesville.  We look forward to expanding to more local farmers markets.   We hope to be in stores and restaurants from Charlottesville to D.C. and Richmond!   

Each and every one of our tortillas are prepared with love and a passion for health and nutrition!!!We are proud to be offering our customers a product that will enhance the quality of their diets as well as their taste buds!                                              What is in it for you?First and most important to us is that you are helping a family stay true their vision of self-sustainability, participating in local economy and offering a whole nutritious food source without additives. This in turn helps strengthen our community! Any and all contributions help and we are grateful for them.What would you be willing to pay for a  zesty, latin flavored party serenaded by local amazing, yet to be announced band, catered organic, local taco buffet by Ula Tortilla, unlimited beer from Blue Mountain Brewery and kombucha from Barefoot Bucha - all at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains?  Did we mention that this is for you and 3 of your friends?! This is what we are offering for your support of $200.  If only 75 people contributed this we would meet our overall goal!!  So all of this for you while helping our family fulfill our vision!   This is a win/win situation!                                                                                                                               What we would like and why:Your support!!  We feel very strongly that what we are doing should be accessible to all!  The only way that would be possible is for us to increase our production.  Currently we are able to produce 20 packs of tortillas in about 2 hours.  With the machine and grinder we are going to purchase we will produce about 60 packs in the same amount of time.  This will enable us to drop our price so more folks could enjoy our tortillas!  It will also allow us to sell wholesale.  Thanks to our new grinder our masa will be stone ground and a finer grind which will allow for better quality and consistency.  The new machine will not only cut and press the tortillas but will also cook them which will also allow for more consistency. We are hoping to be able to purchase the rs-007 For $10,900 and the Molino San Luis for $2,800            How You Can HelpSome people just can’t contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can’t help!  Whether or not you choose to donate, please help us by doing the following!

<p><br/>AltBrau brews mixed culture beers utilizing a variety of yeast, bacteria, malt, hops, fruit, and spices to create beers with complex flavors. We are based in Oakland, California and we will be housing our fermentation vessels (oak barrels, stainless conical tanks, and IBC totes) with our friends at Shady Oak Barrel House. We will be receiving wort (unfermented beer) from several Bay Area breweries.</p>
<p>Our focus is on traditional, rustic-style beers that are unfiltered, unpasteurized, and conditioned in the bottle or keg. We will use both lab grown yeast and bacteria as well as cultures captured in the wild. Our grains and hops will be sourced from a variety of locations but we will put extra attention towards supporting California farmers whenever possible.<br/><br/>We want to demonstrate that these styles of beer are not solely created and consumed in picturesque European villages but also celebrated in vibrant cities and agricultural communities throughout the world... including the greater San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

<p><i><strong>""You won't own the brewery?""</strong></i></p>
<ul>
<li>Starting a brewery is VERY expensive. This will allow us to introduce product to the public while not going into severe debt or losing creative control by bringing on too many investors too soon. Our goal is to open a facility of our own as soon as we have established our products in the market.</li>
<li>Our business model is inspired by the blenders in Belgium who work with brewers in their area to receive wort or young lambic as well as the gypsy/nomad/contract brewers from around the world who are pushing the limits of traditional beer styles.</li>
</ul>
<p><i><strong>""Where can I find your beer?""</strong></i></p>
<ul>
<li>We have scheduled meetings with over a dozen of Northern California's best bottle shops and craft beer bars. We plan to start with a small local footprint near our home in Oakland and slowly expand.</li>
<li>Our goal is to have our beers present at specialty events and festivals outside of our market so we might have the opportunity to present our beers to a wider audience.</li>
</ul>
<p><i><strong>""Can I buy beer from you directly?""</strong></i></p>
<ul><li>Unfortunately we cannot sell direct to consumer right away. As AltBrau grows we plan to change our licensing and open a taproom so we can sell direct and provide a place for customers to enjoy our products.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Our license will allow us to work with a variety of breweries of any size. We are currently in discussion with breweries in our area regarding larger batches and additional space for barrels.</li></ul>
<p><i><strong>""Why not use traditional funding like loans or investors?""</strong></i></p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional lenders generally want ""proof of concept"" to show that the business model is feasible and they also expect to see money flowing in as quick as possible. Mixed fermentations, however, require time and patience. We want to introduce our product to market when it is ready. Once we have quality product on shelves and we can prove our business model works we will be turning to traditional funding options for future expansions.</li>
<li>Breweries in the past have lost creative control or been pushed to rush subpar product by bringing in outside investors who want to see a quick return on their money. We are currently talking with friends and family who would like to invest without directing operations. We want to be sure our vision is not put at risk.</li>

<p><i><strong>""When and where will the Blending Session happen?""</strong></i></p>

""Do your shirts and hoodies come in small sizes, too?""
YES! We are only allowed to enter so many size options so we didn't include smalls.... but if you pick the smallest available size (medium) and email Tim@AltBrau.com telling him your preferred size we can get it printed.
""Whats the date for the yeast capture hike?""
Date is to be determined, but due to working with multiple peoples schedules we are looking at doing 2 dates. If backers can not attend either date we are looking into alternative reward options.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Angry Ferret Brewing has been a project in the works for over 3 years. We searched for over 2 years to find a suitable location. Over those years we looked through many different properties. Until we found our location, we couldn't find an owner that would like to have a brewery. </p>
<p>We finally got our current location and started the process of getting the brewery set up when the Covid shutdown hit. The shutdown has delayed many of the things needed to get open. Many of those things have been finally cleared up.</p>
<p>We were not planning on doing a Kickstarter project. Things have changed for many of us these past few months. We hope that the rewards being offered will be of interest to people. </p>
<p>Funds from this project will go toward expenses necessary to get the brewery up and running. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We have been financing the whole project ourselves. We are finally getting to the point of getting the final plans passed by the city. The county offices have either fully signed off or have given us a short list of changes needed. Those changes are being incorporated into the final plans.</p>
<p>This money will go towards the plumbing and electrical work that needs completing as well as other expenses that pop up.</p>

<h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
<p><i><strong>At the core of it all, we’re passionate craft beer lovers who met through the game of golf. Dogleg Brewing Company is all about celebrating the game that brought us together through exceptional craft beer served up with a fun, engaging tasting room experience.</strong></i></p>
<p>Brewing craft beer and playing golf share distinct traits of the things we love—They are both an art and a science, you have to be creative, calculated, adaptable, and precise, but at the same time it’s very social. Relationships play a big role in what makes both the craft beer and golf community so special.  At the end of the day with both these passions, it’s about the people you meet and the lasting friendships, mutual respect, hard work and dedication to a craft. The more we saw these similarities, the more we realized there was a unique opportunity to combine two of San Diego’s most iconic industries: golf and craft beer.</p>
<p>Our Head Brewer Jim McCaskey has been a home brewer for 25 years, earning many local and national medals for his beer, including the Karl Strauss Pro-Am in 2015 with his Black Nose Smoked Porter. We met Jim through golf, and he's awesome—passionate about brewing and a lifelong student of the craft. He’s kept a records and feedback of every batch he’s every brewed since 1995. It that’s not dedication, I don’t know what is!<br/> </p>
<h3><strong>THE DOGLEG EXPERIENCE</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>We're set out to merge together two of San Diego's great pastimes: golf and craft beer. This is our version of the game, which combines the laid back, inviting SoCal vibe with natural elements and a nod to the vintage traditions of the game.</li>
<li>Dogleg will offer unique membership options that include beer promotions, exclusive tastings, golf tournaments at local courses, handicap hosting, and fun Member events on the simulator and putting green. </li>
<li><p>We teamed up with one of San Diego's long-time award-winning home brewers to bring you a wide variety of classic brews to satisfy your beer taste buds.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Spread the word and up-to-date with our progress on our <a href=""https://www.doglegbrewingco.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/doglegbrewingco/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a> and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/doglegbrewingco/?modal=admin_todo_tour"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<br/>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your generous contributions will go toward building out the brewery's tasting room and making it the top notch experience we plan to bring to locals and tourists alike</li>
<li>These funds will help immensely in the construction costs associated with the tasting room, including the Foresight Sports GCHawk Simulator, putting green, and handcrafted bar.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Just think, this will be the place you bring your buddies to celebrate your first hole-in-one, or maybe you'll find true love... in that roasty smoked porter (or future wife, but we're going with probability here). Perhaps you'll find your own brew crew or weekend golf buddies. The opportunities are endless to grow this community and you can be part of fostering the magic that happens within the walls of Dogleg Brewing Company.</strong><br/> </p>

</div></div>","WHO WE ARE
At the core of it all, we’re passionate craft beer lovers who met through the game of golf. Dogleg Brewing Company is all about celebrating the game that brought us together through exceptional craft beer served up with a fun, engaging tasting room experience.
Brewing craft beer and playing golf share distinct traits of the things we love—They are both an art and a science, you have to be creative, calculated, adaptable, and precise, but at the same time it’s very social. Relationships play a big role in what makes both the craft beer and golf community so special.  At the end of the day with both these passions, it’s about the people you meet and the lasting friendships, mutual respect, hard work and dedication to a craft. The more we saw these similarities, the more we realized there was a unique opportunity to combine two of San Diego’s most iconic industries: golf and craft beer.
Our Head Brewer Jim McCaskey has been a home brewer for 25 years, earning many local and national medals for his beer, including the Karl Strauss Pro-Am in 2015 with his Black Nose Smoked Porter. We met Jim through golf, and he's awesome—passionate about brewing and a lifelong student of the craft. He’s kept a records and feedback of every batch he’s every brewed since 1995. It that’s not dedication, I don’t know what is! 
THE DOGLEG EXPERIENCE

We're set out to merge together two of San Diego's great pastimes: golf and craft beer. This is our version of the game, which combines the laid back, inviting SoCal vibe with natural elements and a nod to the vintage traditions of the game.
Dogleg will offer unique membership options that include beer promotions, exclusive tastings, golf tournaments at local courses, handicap hosting, and fun Member events on the simulator and putting green. 
We teamed up with one of San Diego's long-time award-winning home brewers to bring you a wide variety of classic brews to satisfy your beer taste buds.

Spread the word and up-to-date with our progress on our website, Instagram and Facebook


What We Need & What You Get

Your generous contributions will go toward building out the brewery's tasting room and making it the top notch experience we plan to bring to locals and tourists alike
These funds will help immensely in the construction costs associated with the tasting room, including the Foresight Sports GCHawk Simulator, putting green, and handcrafted bar.

Just think, this will be the place you bring your buddies to celebrate your first hole-in-one, or maybe you'll find true love... in that roasty smoked porter (or future wife, but we're going with probability here). Perhaps you'll find your own brew crew or weekend golf buddies. The opportunities are endless to grow this community and you can be part of fostering the magic that happens within the walls of Dogleg Brewing Company.

<h3>About Featherblade Craft Butchery </h3>
<p>Our mission is simple. Using traditional methods and practices of the age-old craft of butchery we provide the public with delicious, beautifully prepared, ethically reared and sustainably sourced meat in return for a fair price. In doing so we will arm our customers with the knowledge, understanding and means to make informed choices about the meat they eat. We commit to being completely transparent about where we source our meat, and the techniques and processes we use to bring it to your table. Not only that but it will taste great too!</p>
<p>We’re going to be offering the best meat we can find, from real farmers and ranchers, butchered in the traditional way, with a focus on dry-aging, and producing our own sausages, bacon, charcuterie and more. There’ll be classes and evening events too and eventually we’ll be offering custom butchery if you’ve been hunting.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About This Campaign </h3>
<p>Featherblade has been completely self-funded and is close to completion. We wanted to concentrate on the raw meat and deli side of the business but with an eye to expanding down the line. The first thing we will do is offer cooked snacks and food to take away (think sausage rolls, pies, pasties and more!) before shifting to offering online ordering and delivery to Las Vegas and Nevada. </p>
<p>To help, you can pre-purchase discounted meat boxes, vouchers and merch, exclusive offers like creating your own sausage that we’ll sell, and discounted tickets for our ‘Evening with…’ classes. Supporting us through this campaign will not only help us as we open, but will go towards us meetings these goals and being successful in the future.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>Once open, Featherblade will concentrate on our local customers in Las Vegas first and foremost. We knew we were going to be cooking though so that permit is pending, and any support will go towards the cost of ovens, cooking and hot holding equipment etc. Then, we’re looking to expand our website and facilities so we can offer an online shopping and delivery service to Las Vegas and Nevada, and possibly other nearby states too.</p>
<p>In exchange for your early support, we’re able to offer some one-time-only deals, and across-the-board discounts on merchandise, meat vouchers and boxes. We’re also offer the chance to become a Featherblade Founder, meaning you’ll be a friend of the store and will receive discounts for <strong>LIFE</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Once We Open</h3>
<p>Once open, you can pick up any merchandise bought in the store or we can ship it  to you if that is what you’d prefer. You can obviously redeem any voucher or collect your meat box in store once we open, and if you booked a class or the sausage adoption, we will be in touch to discuss how to arrange dates etc. If you decide to become a Featherblade Founder, we will present your lifetime Founder card in store with a little chat so we can get to know each other.</p>
<p>We will of course offer refunds on any of these before the campaign ends, and if you can’t make an event or change your mind after we open, we will offer a Featherblade voucher for the same dollar amount that can be spent on anything in store.</p>

<h3>The Campaign Continues</h3>
<p>As many of you know, we launched our initial funding campaign for Evanston's First Food Bike days before the global pandemic forced many of us inside and out of social contact.</p>
<p>All of our public fundraising events were cancelled and we made the difficult decision to suspend our campaign until we could see a way forward.</p>
<p>While Illinois and many other states are still under shelter-in-place orders, we are beginning to see a light at the end of the tunnel. </p>
<p>With that in mind we have relaunched and retooled our campaign for Evanston's First Food Bike with the help of <a href=""http://ferlabikes.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ferla Bikes </a>.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Wandering Café is a mobile food vending bike and catering service operating in Evanston and the North Shore area.  We use locally sourced ingredients to produce fresh, healthy street food. The Wandering Café’s chef driven menu rotates seasonally and includes a variety of vegetarian options. </p>
<p>We're committed to expanding consumer access to locally sourced food without the need to order from a restaurant. The Wandering Café is Evanston’s first chef inspired, pedal powered, mobile kitchen. Unlike food trucks, our low carbon footprint allows us to bring our product to the streets in an environmentally responsible way. </p>
<p>As a mobile food cart, The Wandering Café will operate 3 days a week, between 6-8 hours a day. The bike will have 3 rotating locations where customers can purchase our food. As a catering service, The Wandering Café will be available for private events and parties. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I discovered a new love for cooking since 2005; one day I saw a culinary instructor sprinkle parsley on a plate and was instantly fascinated by the beauty of the food. Since then, I have obtained two culinary certificates, have gone to work for various establishments like Legal Seafood, The Sheraton Hotel, MIT as a supervisor, an Executive sous-chef at the John Hancock in Boston and Sous-chef at Harvard University.</p>
<p>Throughout my career, I have always loved the art of combining different ingredients and flavors to make a dish as well as plating food in a way that was pleasing to the eye. People are always appreciative of the food I cook and the way I present on a plate to which my response is always “Beautiful food for Beautiful people”. I truly believe that regardless of where we are in our walks of life, we are all beautiful people.</p>
<p>I am excited to bring 50Kitchen to Fields Corner and give back to the community where I grew up. While this current generation lacks mentors, my hope is for 50Kitchen to bridge the gap and provide support to the youth in this community.</p>

<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>50Kitchen will not only be a beautiful diverse addition to Fields Corner but we are excited to give back to this community through various programs. Our goal is to partner with local shelters as a way to help fight hunger. In addition, we have partnered with Helen Y. Davis Leadership Academy for our “a day in the life” program. Our food program will allow us to provide food to local shelters daily while our school program will allow us to mentor young children and show them basic skills on the daily operations of a restaurant.</p>
<h3>Our Food</h3>
<p>Our food will be comprised of fusion style inspired dishes, from Southern American and Asian inspired dishes to a wide range of various cuisines. We’re excited to bring diverse food options to the Fields Corner area of Dorchester.</p>
<h3>Your impact</h3>

<p>While we have been blessed to have most of what we need, we still need your help to cover kitchen equipment and furniture for 50Kitchen restaurant. Our main goal is to bring something culturally different to the neighborhood, and we cannot do it without your help.</p>
