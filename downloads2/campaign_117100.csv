<h3>Who?</h3>
<p>I'm Brent Thomas. I'm a husband and father who works as an elementary school teacher and a camp manager. But I also manage to find time to podcast and write fiction.</p>
<p>I love writing and telling stories. It's how I relax. I don't really feel complete unless part of my time goes into creating worlds. As I got older, I'd almost let this hobby go, until about six years ago when I started using it to de-stress after work. Now, I have fully embraced that writing is part of who I am and that I want to share my writing with others.</p>
<p>In 2015, two very important things happened. Most important was that my wife and I welcomed our first child. But, before that happened I also managed to self-publish my first novel, <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28999271-deadly-troubadours?ac=1&amp;from_search=true"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Deadly Troubadours.</a></p>
<p>Now, I am putting the finishing touches on its sequel, Sand, Sea and Stone, and want to fund a limited edition print run.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>When I put out my first novel, I originally just used various ebook services and Amazon's Createspace to make a paperback. I like all those services, but I'm based in Japan and (especially the paperbacks) aren't easy to get a hold of. Ordering it there can result in a month or two wait.</p>
<p>I found myself wanting to put out a locally printed copy, but I also new that if I did, it needed to be of superior quality to what is available through Amazon. Living where I am, there is now way I can match the low shipping and handling costs that Amazon provides, but what I can do is create a superior product.</p>
<p>I will use the same printer for Sand, Sea and Stone that I did for Deadly Troubadours. That means a book with high quality paper, a bit more width for more comfortable reading, color accent pages at the front and back for greater aesthetics. One thing that is true about Japan, they can do quality paper products. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>To sell books. No, really. I'm asking for $4000 USD. If all my contributors simple by a paperback (and the S/H) that is enough to sell 160 books. And, in all honesty it is enough to print about 300. The more I print, the cheaper per item they become. If I manage to print 200, the company estimate is that it would basically cost $12.50 to print. Since I'm charging $15 dollars a book, that gets me around $2.50 for every book sold. If you want to read a more detailed breakdown on pricing, visit <a href=""https://deadlytroubadour.com/2017/09/28/indiegogo-5-the-money-side/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this post</a>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is my second Indiegogo campaign. The first one was successful and I'm hoping this one will be as well. </p>
<p>I'll be honest, my biggest worry is time. My wife and I are doing this as a team. But we have a two year old that we adore, and he manages to eat up a lot of our time. My last Indiegogo was for 30 days. This one is scheduled for 60. The reason is that I am almost certain that I won't be able to dedicate as much time to getting this accomplished as I could when he was only a few months old. He sleeps less and needs more play.</p>
<p>Outside of that I am dedicated to getting this print run out. I have funds set aside to do a minimum run of 200 copies. Of course, I would love for contributors to order up those copies so the I don't finish in the red. But this books will be printed and will be distributed.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word through Facebook, twitter, or any other social media you know of. If you have read Deadly Troubadours and didn't leave a review or rating at Goodreads, iTunes, and Amazon, please do so. </p>
<p>And, I hate to ask for money on top of asking for money, there is also my<a href=""https://www.patreon.com/brentthomas"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Patreon site</a> where you can pledge a monthly donation to help me continue writing and podcasting. Even a dollar a month makes a difference.</p>

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>El doble</strong> es una disparatada oda a los dobles. Y al arte en todas sus manifestaciones. A la cultura y a la contracultura. Y al insondable secreto que reside en los procesos estocásticos.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">En un antiguo tratado indio sobre esoterismo se explicaba la existencia de los dobles, más o menos, así: Todos tenemos un doble.

Los dobles están destinados a no encontrarse jamás.  Vale. Es imposible que se encuentren nunca. A pesar de todo, ¿qué ocurriría si se encontraran? De ahí surge <i>El doble</i>, de coquetear con <i>la posibilidad</i>. O quizá de huir por el punto de fuga. Además de otras muchas cuestiones, que oscilan entre una reflexión sobre el África en venta, un emocionado homenaje al dadaísmo, una comprensión de la profundidad de pictórica como arcano a descubrir, una extravagante visión del nacionalismo catalán y del cálculo geográfico de las antípodas, una crítica a los <i>realitys </i>televisivos, un canto a los viejos reporteros de guerra y a los carteros y un análisis del miedo.

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Las intrahistorias de un buen número de personajes se entretejen y convergen con las de Héctor Espejo, un cartero de Barcelona muy viajado que busca comprender un antiguo secreto en el punto de fuga de una pintura, viajando para ello a un Madagascar en guerra, y Edmond Hinault, reportero de guerra francés, tuerto y cojo, que anhela huir en pos de la tranquilidad de la vida familiar y, mientras, se oculta de un sicario en su antiguo piso de Barcelona.

<p><b><u>Why
Fund This Book?</u></b></p>
<p>Have you ever felt like there’s an emptiness deep in
the pit of your stomach and you just can’t make it go away, no matter what you
do? I remember feeling it myself when I was growing up, as I struggled with
gaining a sense of life meaning and purpose. I still shudder when I remember
experiencing the sense of meaninglessness as that void in my stomach. I wish I
knew when growing up that you can use science-based strategies to find a sense
of meaning and purpose in life. </p>
<p>That’s what pushed me as a <a href=""https://decisionsciences.osu.edu/people/tsipursky.1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">professor at Ohio State University </a>to research
this topic for many years, and then present it to a broad audience through writing ""Find Your Purpose Using Science!"" </p><p>This workbook includes:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">an overview of the latest research about meaning and purpose from a variety of fields, such as psychology and cognitive science</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">research-based exercises and worksheets to guide you through the process of building a personal sense of purpose</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">stories about people who have used these tools to gain a deeper sense of purpose and how it impacted their lives. </span><br/>
</li>
</ul><p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GX1rCNYcI0fckBx0KPBwT-TrA7HKWXw_VdXpqSUNvGA/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here is a link</a> to the first couple of chapters, as well as the table of contents to give you an idea of what's included in this e-book.</p><p><span>All contributions in 
support of the book publication are tax deductible, since they will be 
going to <a href=""http://intentionalinsights.org/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Intentional Insights</a>, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that 
is helping fund the book’s publication. I am the volunteer President and
 a Co-Founder of Intentional Insights (InIn), and will donate 50% of
the profit from the workbook to Intentional Insights. This workbook is part of 
our broader offerings that empower people to refine and reach their 
goals by providing research-based content to help improve thinking, 
feeling, and behavior patterns.</span><br/>
</p><p>So help yourself and others use science-based approaches to find your
meaning and purpose by funding this workbook! </p><p><br/></p>
<p><b><u>Will
This Book Really Work? </u></b></p>
<p>Can science really answer life’s big questions?
Well, a wave of recent research in psychology, medicine, and other fields has
explored how we find meaning and purpose. These questions are really important
for our everyday life. The science shows that people who lack a rich sense of
purpose have significantly worse mental and physical health. Fortunately, you
can learn research-based strategies to help yourself find a deeper sense of
your own life meaning, improve your own health, and fill any void you may experience
in the depth of your own stomach. </p>
<p>This book’s strategies sure worked well for <a href=""https://history.osu.edu/directory/Johnson4195"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">John Johnson</a>. He was a graduate student at OSU, working on his doctoral dissertation. But
he felt that deep sense of anxiety that he wasn’t
doing what would give his life meaning. He read a draft version of “Find Your
Purpose Using Science,” and he told me that this book literally changed his life course. He decided not to complete his doctoral dissertation and instead
become a school teacher. I’m thrilled for him, and I included his story in the
final version of the book. I’m also somewhat jealous of him, as I really wish I
had a book like that to read when I was struggling with my own journey. It
would have prevented so much needless suffering for me. </p>
<p>The vast majority of guidance on meaning and purpose
comes from religion and cultural heritage. While this guidance works for some,
traditional sources of meaning and purpose don’t speak nearly so well to
others. People like John, myself, and maybe you too want an evidence-based approach in which we
can be truly confident. <br/></p><p>You can be confident about this book, since it’s
based on the latest research to tell you about tools that have been proven to help you find a
personal sense of meaning and purpose. You can also take a look at some early <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zzbvXKl1ymewbxA0q_8u0RPTY5DeUWdzMEE-icUwr7A/edit"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">feedback from experts</a>.<br/></p><p>With your help, we will release science-based strategies for finding meaning and purpose from the Ivory Tower of complex academic articles to be widely accessible for a broad public.<br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><u>Book
Costs</u></b></p>
<p>When I started writing “Find Your Purpose Using
Science,” I had no idea of the costs involved in producing and self-publishing
an e-book! I certainly learned a lot, from articles such as <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2013/05/the-real-costs-of-self-publishing-book"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this
one</a> that describe in detail the actual costs of self-publishing. These
include development and copy-editing, proofreading, cover and illustrations, formatting and digital conversion, online marketing, printed marketing materials, PR and media publicity, and other fees. <br/></p><p>The higher end of these fees runs $35,000 or more, as the article describes. I decided to aim for $4,700 as a way to take the lower but not lowest

</b><p>Any
amount you can contribute is appreciated. I would also appreciate it if you would spread the word about this campaign and the science-based offerings at <a href=""http://intentionalinsights.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Intentional Insights</a> to others. Thank you so much!</p>
</div>","Why
Fund This Book?
Have you ever felt like there’s an emptiness deep in
the pit of your stomach and you just can’t make it go away, no matter what you
do? I remember feeling it myself when I was growing up, as I struggled with
gaining a sense of life meaning and purpose. I still shudder when I remember
experiencing the sense of meaninglessness as that void in my stomach. I wish I
knew when growing up that you can use science-based strategies to find a sense
of meaning and purpose in life. 
That’s what pushed me as a professor at Ohio State University to research
this topic for many years, and then present it to a broad audience through writing ""Find Your Purpose Using Science!"" This workbook includes:

an overview of the latest research about meaning and purpose from a variety of fields, such as psychology and cognitive science


research-based exercises and worksheets to guide you through the process of building a personal sense of purpose


stories about people who have used these tools to gain a deeper sense of purpose and how it impacted their lives. 

Here is a link to the first couple of chapters, as well as the table of contents to give you an idea of what's included in this e-book.All contributions in 
support of the book publication are tax deductible, since they will be 
going to Intentional Insights, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that 
is helping fund the book’s publication. I am the volunteer President and
 a Co-Founder of Intentional Insights (InIn), and will donate 50% of
the profit from the workbook to Intentional Insights. This workbook is part of 
our broader offerings that empower people to refine and reach their 
goals by providing research-based content to help improve thinking, 
feeling, and behavior patterns.
So help yourself and others use science-based approaches to find your
meaning and purpose by funding this workbook! 
Will
This Book Really Work? 
Can science really answer life’s big questions?
Well, a wave of recent research in psychology, medicine, and other fields has
explored how we find meaning and purpose. These questions are really important
for our everyday life. The science shows that people who lack a rich sense of
purpose have significantly worse mental and physical health. Fortunately, you
can learn research-based strategies to help yourself find a deeper sense of
your own life meaning, improve your own health, and fill any void you may experience
in the depth of your own stomach. 
This book’s strategies sure worked well for John Johnson. He was a graduate student at OSU, working on his doctoral dissertation. But
he felt that deep sense of anxiety that he wasn’t
doing what would give his life meaning. He read a draft version of “Find Your
Purpose Using Science,” and he told me that this book literally changed his life course. He decided not to complete his doctoral dissertation and instead
become a school teacher. I’m thrilled for him, and I included his story in the
final version of the book. I’m also somewhat jealous of him, as I really wish I
had a book like that to read when I was struggling with my own journey. It
would have prevented so much needless suffering for me. 
The vast majority of guidance on meaning and purpose
comes from religion and cultural heritage. While this guidance works for some,
traditional sources of meaning and purpose don’t speak nearly so well to
others. People like John, myself, and maybe you too want an evidence-based approach in which we
can be truly confident. You can be confident about this book, since it’s
based on the latest research to tell you about tools that have been proven to help you find a
personal sense of meaning and purpose. You can also take a look at some early feedback from experts.With your help, we will release science-based strategies for finding meaning and purpose from the Ivory Tower of complex academic articles to be widely accessible for a broad public.

Book
Costs
When I started writing “Find Your Purpose Using
Science,” I had no idea of the costs involved in producing and self-publishing
an e-book! I certainly learned a lot, from articles such as this
one that describe in detail the actual costs of self-publishing. These
include development and copy-editing, proofreading, cover and illustrations, formatting and digital conversion, online marketing, printed marketing materials, PR and media publicity, and other fees. The higher end of these fees runs $35,000 or more, as the article describes. I decided to aim for $4,700 as a way to take the lower but not lowest
tier of all of these services. Here is the breakdown of costs:

editing and proofreading: $1,080


cover design and illustrations: $860


formatting and digital conversion: $480


ISBN: $125


online marketing: $850


printed marketing materials: $370

PR and media publicity: $730

other fees: $205

I will be releasing this digital version of the book on Amazon's Kindle, which offers a Free Kindle App for computers, tablets, and phones, so anyone who has internet access can get the book! If the digital version of the book does well enough to justify the expense, or if the stretch goal below is met, I will also work on putting out this book in hard copy and audiobook formats. Stretch Goals- Stretch Goal 1 (Above $4,700 and below $7,000)A better product and superior experience for you and other readers: higher-quality graphics, editing, and other improvements to make a better book.- Stretch Goal 2 ($7,000)I will research and write an extra chapter about science-based strategies for finding meaning and purpose in one's work.- Stretch Goal 3 ($10,000)I will make this book available for
FREE on Amazon for the first 5 days after its publication.  - Stretch Goal 4 ($14,000)I will collaborate with a programmer to develop an online app to 
accompany the book. This app will be a tool to guide you and others to 
gain a greater sense of meaning and purpose in life, to be available by the end of 2015.- Stretch Goal 5 ($20,000)I will research and write an expanded and revised version of this book 
that will be published by the end of 2015 in a variety of formats, 
including e-book, hard copy, and audiobook.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>The Principles of Good Taste and Ornament is a novel about societal prescriptions assigned to a suburban mother named Ann Moore whose identity is called into question after she survives putting her head in the oven on a summer’s day. The fictional thriller is based on the realities of modernity colliding with regressive tradition.<br/><br/>My name is Jada Henry and I am the author of The Principles of Good Taste and Ornament. I wrote this book because we as a society often conjure up ghouls and goblins to embody the horrors that are right in front of us. I wanted to confront those horrors and the consequences that are attached.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover your own role in enabling these horrors. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for combining thrillers with reality in storytelling. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a social critique.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about:</p>
<p>Microaggressions - Ann enters a book club that is full of complacent women who mask their back-handed compliments in “genuine” concern about Ann’s well-being and recovery.</p>
<p>Gender Roles - Both Ann and Stasia are expected to abide by the household duties of women, despite Dr. Moore having the capability to do these tasks as well but rather having the choice not to because he is a man.</p>
<p>Tokenism- The notion of “the ideal woman” creates friction between Stasia and Ann before they are even old enough to understand what that means.</p>
<p><br/>You will love this book if you enjoy horror novels based in the realities of everyday life.<br/><br/>The Principles of Good Taste and Ornament is a fiction book that speaks to women and those affected by gendered policies and horror junkies who are looking at how thrillers are derived from real life experiences that we all take a part of.</p>

<p>The University of South Florida art history organization Art Research Forum is looking to raise funds in order to publish MFA catalogs for the graduating class of 2017!  Our goal is to raise $5,000 so we can print 500 copies of a professional, high quality 50-page catalog.</p>
<p>The publication of this catalog will offer us the opportunity to collaborate with our sister organization, the Masters of Fine Arts Organization (MFAO), and gain experience interacting with and writing about contemporary artists.  The publication of an MFA catalog is an academic and fine arts initiative that supports the exemplary work created by graduate students at USF. Furthermore, this is a group project where everyone will have a critical role in designing, writing, or editing the catalog. The funds allocated to this project will provide a clear and resounding voice for USF’s graduate students while serving as a tangible reminder that USF is an advocate for the fine arts within the larger area of Tampa Bay, and the international arts community.  Only you can help make this happen!</p>
<p>Over the past two years, we were able to implement successful fundraising initiatives and meet our goal of publishing catalogs for previous classes. The professional confidence gained through the realization of this endeavor has been invaluable. USF’s College of the Arts began a tradition of artistic collaboration and excellence that we hope to build upon this year.</p>
<p>Our team of graduate art historians includes: Jeanie Ambrosio, Marlena Antonucci, James Cartwright, Tracey Cole, Laura Colkitt, Mariana Gomez, Erin Hughes, Amanda Poss, Alexandria Salmieri, and Ashley Williams. (*See examples of their professional accolades below under ""Getting to know our writers."") </p>
<p>Supported also by graduate editor Ashley Muraszewski and undergraduate art historians Sara-Kay West, Richard Ellis, and Kristen Clayton.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our first two fundraising campaigns raised £2,000, enough to fund the deposits and campaigns of two of the four prospective parliamentary candidate who’ll be standing for J4MB at the May 2015 general election (the other two candidates were already funded).</p>
<p>We’re now looking for a further £1,000 in the coming 30 days, to fund our fifth candidate (deadline: 31 October). Our goal is to field 30 candidates at the May 2015<br/>general election.</p>
<p>I’m Mike Buchanan, a 55-year-old British writer, publisher, and advocate for the human rights of men and boys. I lead a political party registered in February 2013, ‘Justice for men &amp; boys (and the women who love them)’. We're determined to change the face of British politics, and we’re contributing material to a television documentary producer who’s working on a lengthy documentary about feminism, to be broadcast on a major television channel in early 2014.</p>
<p>The human rights of British men and boys have been assaulted by the actions and<br/>inactions of the state for 30+ years, and we plan to contest the top 30 Conservative marginal seats at the May 2015 general election. I worked as a consultant for the Conservative party (2006-8) but in common with many Conservatives I’ve been dismayed that under David Cameron’s leadership the party has been as anti-male and pro-feminist as its Labour predecessors.</p>

Though I didn't win the final award, I did earn a nice review from Publishers Weekly as part of the competition (the review no longer appears on the Amazon site because the competition has long passed, but a scanned copy appears here). Read some of the judges' reviews here.The book currently appears on Amazon.com as an out-of-print (limited availability) product because I was never able to come up with the funds to see the project through properly. Hoping that will change with this crowdfunding campaign. :-)Read excerpts here!
What We Need & What You Get
I've run the numbers again and again, and working on a tight budget utilizing the most affordable resources I could find, here's how it breaks down:Front/back cover design and interior formatting: $1200Ebook creation: $350Video book trailer: $450Print Run: $6000This just gets the book published. If I happen to raise more than the $8,000 I'm seeking, then it'll go towards marketing. If I raise less than $8,000, whatever is raised will go toward the cover and interior design and a considerably smaller print run. In that case, the Ebook creation will become an even more important part of getting my words out there!I've created some small perks for people who want to contribute their hard-earned dollars to my project! They are pretty self-explanatory and you can see the details of each in the boxes to the right.Other Ways You Can HelpWord-of-mouth is always appreciated! So even if you are not able to contribute, I'd love for you to spread the word about my project via your social media channels. Indiegogo even provides tools to help you share easily. And tell you personal circle of friends as well. If you say I'm an awesome talent, they'll most likely believe it. :-)Thanks again for visiting my page. I hope you'll join my crowd!",1.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Kaleb Hugo is
everything an officer of the Service should be: loyal, expertly
trained, unquestioning. He has done everything ever ordered of him
and has done so with a pride that comes from knowing you are fighting
for the good of humankind... until the day that he made a decision,
as he has had to many times before, in order to ensure the best
outcome for the Service, even though it was in direct violation of
regulations.</p>
<p>
A battle was won,
but Hugo was condemned and dishonourably discharged by Service
commanders for going against orders and risking himself and his unit
to save an inhabited satellite that had been determined as an
acceptable loss.</p>
<p>
Officially, anyway.</p>
<p>
<span><span>Unofficially,
Hugo was re-assigned to captain the crew of the </span></span><em><span><span>Zero</span></span></em><span><span>,
an eight-man craft that is classified in all Service records as, at
best, a privateer ship and at worse a smuggling and borderline
criminal enterprise vessel. What very few people in the Service know
is that the Zero, and its crew, are contracted by the Service. Their
role is to investigate and infiltrate the less savoury and
unacknowledged levels of human society. They sell on, buy in,
bargain, threaten and report back on everything the political levels
the Service don't officially want to know.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>The
</span></span><em><span><span>Zero</span></span></em><span><span>'s
rag-tag crew look to their commander, Ezekiel Webb, as their leader
and middleman between the regimented expectations of the Service and
the harsh and unpredictable demands of the underworld of colonial
space. He knows he is not captain material but has not managed to
serve well under any that have been placed over him. Both Captain and
Commander clash, but they will have to adapt and find a compromise if
the </span></span><em><span><span>Zero </span></span></em><span><span>is
to carry out her missions successfully and for the harmony of the
crew.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>As
the </span></span><em><span><span>Zero
</span></span></em><span><span>is

an orbit-wide game of politics, deceit and corruption which will
threaten to tear them apart and throw Humanity back into a cycle of
war and destruction. To stop this and preserve the fragile peace,
Hugo, Webb and the crew will have to overcome personal tragedy,
insurmountable odds and every cruel depraved twist of fate that the
Orbit can throw at them.</span></span></p>
<p>
As events escalate
out of control, Hugo will have to go against everything he has ever
believed in to save his crew and billions of innocent people. The
outcome is always uncertain, but for the crew of the Zero, it was
always this way. What will transpire will decide not just their fate,

The columns feature profiles and conversations with icons as disparate as funnyman Mel Brooks, writer Michael Chabon, architect Frank Gehry, French Philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy and legendary Hollywood Producer Robert Evans.

I believe in the power of culture, in the power of good books, good conversation and interesting people to improve the quality of our lives.  Writing this column has made my life so much richer. I hope reading it does the same for you.






The cost to publish all six volumes is $7,500 which is what I aim to raise in this campaign. 






This covers: The cost of designing front and back covers and the interior page design for all six volumes in all Ebook formats (kindle, nook and epub) and paperback print-on-demand format, as well as the set-up and registration costs. Any and all sums raised will go to defray the costs of publication


$7500 is my cost for publishing the collection and to do so I'm offering the copies at a substantial discount along with some priceless perks (which I've nonetheless put a price on).




The six volumes are organized chronologically, covering around two years a book between 2003 and 2015.

<h3>Who are you? What is this project about?</h3>
<p>We are a group of hackers, computer hobbyists, gaming enthusiasts and journalists from Finland. We grew up reading about computers, programming, games and computer culture in magazines. They taught many of us how to do things ourselves instead of only consuming ready-made products. They raised the generation that gave birth to innovations like IRC and Linux and companies like Supercell, Remedy and Housemarque.</p>
<p>One by one, these hacker magazines disappeared from the mainstream and died off – in Finland and everywhere else. We felt sorry that they were gone. The Internet is great, of course, but it will never be permanent like print is. Articles on websites tend to disappear, but we can still read magazines from a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Three years ago, we decided to make a magazine ourselves. We were fascinated with the idea of making something that we used to love, but writing about the topics of the present day. It turned out that this was a good idea, since a lot of people wanted to join us in making such a magazine. Skrolli and its community were born, and a total of 12 issues have been published since then.</p>
<p>The time has come to present Skrolli to an international audience. If this crowdfunding campaign succeeds, we can print an issue in English. If there is enough interest, we can even start publishing Skrolli in two languages.</p>
<h3>Why would you make a print magazine in 2016?</h3>Because we want to make a beautiful object that you can browse at your own pace, store on your shelf and come back to later on. We want to write stories that stand the test of time, stories that are good enough to be permanently written on paper.<p></p>
<p>Skrolli is printed in a high-quality print shop in Finland on eco-friendly paper. Our magazine is a sustainable premium product.</p>
</div><h3>Who is Skrolli made for?</h3><p></p><p>Skrolli is for anyone interested in the maker culture around computing and gaming. If you want to learn about how computers and operating systems work, hone your programming skills, gain practical insight into the latest technology, or simply read in-depth articles and columns from these fields, then Skrolli is the magazine for you.</p>Skrolli is made for the community and by the community. Many of our articles are written by fans of the magazine who are also experts in their field.

Who are you? What is this project about?
We are a group of hackers, computer hobbyists, gaming enthusiasts and journalists from Finland. We grew up reading about computers, programming, games and computer culture in magazines. They taught many of us how to do things ourselves instead of only consuming ready-made products. They raised the generation that gave birth to innovations like IRC and Linux and companies like Supercell, Remedy and Housemarque.
One by one, these hacker magazines disappeared from the mainstream and died off – in Finland and everywhere else. We felt sorry that they were gone. The Internet is great, of course, but it will never be permanent like print is. Articles on websites tend to disappear, but we can still read magazines from a hundred years ago.
Three years ago, we decided to make a magazine ourselves. We were fascinated with the idea of making something that we used to love, but writing about the topics of the present day. It turned out that this was a good idea, since a lot of people wanted to join us in making such a magazine. Skrolli and its community were born, and a total of 12 issues have been published since then.
The time has come to present Skrolli to an international audience. If this crowdfunding campaign succeeds, we can print an issue in English. If there is enough interest, we can even start publishing Skrolli in two languages.
Why would you make a print magazine in 2016?Because we want to make a beautiful object that you can browse at your own pace, store on your shelf and come back to later on. We want to write stories that stand the test of time, stories that are good enough to be permanently written on paper.
Skrolli is printed in a high-quality print shop in Finland on eco-friendly paper. Our magazine is a sustainable premium product.
Who is Skrolli made for?Skrolli is for anyone interested in the maker culture around computing and gaming. If you want to learn about how computers and operating systems work, hone your programming skills, gain practical insight into the latest technology, or simply read in-depth articles and columns from these fields, then Skrolli is the magazine for you.Skrolli is made for the community and by the community. Many of our articles are written by fans of the magazine who are also experts in their field. This is a magazine unlike any other.Please see here for a list of articles that have been published so far in the Finnish version.This is a tentative cover and may differ from the final product.Is this another ‘retro’ magazine?You will find stories about old computers, game systems and other hardware in our magazine, but we are not only here to write about the past.

<p><strong>The Story of Foliage Notebook</strong></p>

<h3>Novel Synopsis</h3>
<p><i>With compelling lyricism, Hum A Radiant Sickness takes the reader on a surreal romp through the subconscious of a young man teetering on the ledge between a terrifying but hallowed self-actualization and the begrudging contentedness of an imposed conformity. </i></p>
<p>Conor Fallow sees his massive student loan debt as a barrier preventing him from achieving something meaningful with his life. As his senior year is coming to a close, however, he’s adopted an escapist attitude—picking up self-destructive habits and doing his best to ignore his future. While on a nightly walk filled with alcohol and malpracticed meditation, Conor runs into an old friend, Luce, who invites him to take part in a strange urban rite. Their guides, Jim-Jam and No Name explain that the aesthetic of the scene, looking out from a particular point atop a parking garage, is so intense that it creates a powerful psychedelic effect. Conor is skeptical but is willing to try it. To his surprise, and horror, looking out at the city does have a profound effect on his psyche…</p>
<p><i>A young man simultaneously discovers his ambition and confronts the knowledge that he cannot pursue that ambition. He squirms within the confines of this paralysis. We weep for him, and we laugh with him at the absurdity of our situation. We laugh and laugh—and we don’t give up.</i></p>

<h3>What's Your Plan &amp; Budget?</h3>
<p>You will be helping to fund the publication and initial marketing of my debut novel, <i>Hum A Radiant Sickness</i>. <strong>I plan to release mid-March 2017.</strong> The majority of the production work has been completed, and the methods I’ve chosen for distribution incur minimal upfront costs. This campaign is focused largely on raising funds to help market and promote the novel. I need to get the word out, and I need your help. Here’s my plan and budget for this campaign.</p>
<ul>
<li>Production - $300</li>
<li>Distribution - $300</li>
<li>Marketing - $1,400</li>
<li>Travel &amp; Promo - $900</li>
<li>Total: $2,900</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Production - $300</i></p>
<ul>
<li>All copy has been drafted and edited, and the manuscript has been formatted for each distribution channel.</li>
<li>Cover Design: $300 – Hiring a professional designer to complete the artwork and layout of my cover for both the eBook and print editions.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Distribution - $300</i></p>
<p>E-books comprise 30-35 percent of all US book sales. 60 percent or more of all US book sales (both print and digital) happen through an online retailer, primarily Amazon. My plan of attack is to publish in Kindle eBook format through <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjn1eHFh_XQAhVB4GMKHV3NA4IQFggcMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fkdp.amazon.com%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNF8YIGbbiGmEzk5j-_-BM64oPkNQA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amazon KDP</a> and print on demand (POD) format through <a href=""http://createspace.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CreateSpace</a> (selling via Amazon). I will expand into other eBook and print markets through distributors targeting the non-Amazon space, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=""http://createspace.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CreateSpace</a>: POD edition via Amazon sales (no upfront cost)</li>
<li>
<a href=""http://kdp.amazon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amazon KDP</a>: eBook sales via Amazon (no upfront cost)</li>
<li>

<li>
<a href=""http://draft2digital.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Draft2Digital</a>: eBook sales to markets outside of Amazon (no upfront cost)</li>
</ul>
<p>I will need to purchase a unique ISBN for the print edition and each eBook edition.</p>
<ul><li>10x ISBN @ <a href=""http://myidentifiers.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://myidentifiers.com/</a> - $250</li></ul>

<li>Book Release &amp; Launch Party - $250</li>
<li>Indiegogo Perk Supplement - $250</li>
<li>Indiegogo Fee Coverage (5% of $2750) – ~$150</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What Will You Do If We Exceed Your Goal?</h3>
<p>All additional funds beyond my stated goal will be used to increase my marketing budget. You will be helping me to expand visibility and promote additional sales.</p>
<p>If we get to $5,000, all backers will be included on a list to receive a free eBook copy of my second novel, <i>Blank Holiday</i>, when ready for publication. I’ll also hold the “Rocky” pose for 30 minutes atop the parking garage in Charleston, SC that inspired this novel.</p>
<h3>What If The Goal Is Not Met?</h3>
<p>This is a reasonable funding goal to back the publishing and marketing of my novel. I believe it is achievable (fingers crossed). If it is not met, the available funds in the campaign will still go to me (with a fee to Indiegogo). I will move forward with publishing through the distributors noted above. My marketing, travel and promo budget will have to be cut, however, limiting my reach. All backers will still receive their perks, even if the goal is not met. </p>

Novel Synopsis
With compelling lyricism, Hum A Radiant Sickness takes the reader on a surreal romp through the subconscious of a young man teetering on the ledge between a terrifying but hallowed self-actualization and the begrudging contentedness of an imposed conformity. 
Conor Fallow sees his massive student loan debt as a barrier preventing him from achieving something meaningful with his life. As his senior year is coming to a close, however, he’s adopted an escapist attitude—picking up self-destructive habits and doing his best to ignore his future. While on a nightly walk filled with alcohol and malpracticed meditation, Conor runs into an old friend, Luce, who invites him to take part in a strange urban rite. Their guides, Jim-Jam and No Name explain that the aesthetic of the scene, looking out from a particular point atop a parking garage, is so intense that it creates a powerful psychedelic effect. Conor is skeptical but is willing to try it. To his surprise, and horror, looking out at the city does have a profound effect on his psyche…
A young man simultaneously discovers his ambition and confronts the knowledge that he cannot pursue that ambition. He squirms within the confines of this paralysis. We weep for him, and we laugh with him at the absurdity of our situation. We laugh and laugh—and we don’t give up.

Can We Read A Sample Chapter?
Yep. Here you go.
And you can join my mailing list here.

What's Your Plan & Budget?
You will be helping to fund the publication and initial marketing of my debut novel, Hum A Radiant Sickness. I plan to release mid-March 2017. The majority of the production work has been completed, and the methods I’ve chosen for distribution incur minimal upfront costs. This campaign is focused largely on raising funds to help market and promote the novel. I need to get the word out, and I need your help. Here’s my plan and budget for this campaign.

Production - $300
Distribution - $300
Marketing - $1,400
Travel & Promo - $900
Total: $2,900

Production - $300

All copy has been drafted and edited, and the manuscript has been formatted for each distribution channel.
Cover Design: $300 – Hiring a professional designer to complete the artwork and layout of my cover for both the eBook and print editions.

Distribution - $300
E-books comprise 30-35 percent of all US book sales. 60 percent or more of all US book sales (both print and digital) happen through an online retailer, primarily Amazon. My plan of attack is to publish in Kindle eBook format through Amazon KDP and print on demand (POD) format through CreateSpace (selling via Amazon). I will expand into other eBook and print markets through distributors targeting the non-Amazon space, as follows:


CreateSpace: POD edition via Amazon sales (no upfront cost)

Amazon KDP: eBook sales via Amazon (no upfront cost)

IngramSpark: POD edition for markets outside of Amazon ($50)

Draft2Digital: eBook sales to markets outside of Amazon (no upfront cost)

I will need to purchase a unique ISBN for the print edition and each eBook edition.
10x ISBN @ http://myidentifiers.com/ - $250
Marketing - $1,400

Advanced Reviews & Website Features - $300
Website Hosting: $25 / month WordPress @ 12 months - $300 (Website currently in development)
Digital Banner Ad Design: $50
Google AdWords Budget (PPC): $250 (5 month budget @ $50 per month)

Placeit Graphic Design - $50
Business Card Printing (250x) - $40
Stickers (100x) - $40
Bookmarks (100x) - $40
Stencil Printing (100x) - $50
Banner Poster Design - $200
Banner Poster & Stand for promotion at speaking ops and events - $100

Travel & Other - $900

Travel, Speaking & Events to Promote the Book: $250 to cover gas and food for brief weekend excursions. Semi-local over first several months. Targeting universities, literary events and open mics.
Book Release & Launch Party - $250
Indiegogo Perk Supplement - $250
Indiegogo Fee Coverage (5% of $2750) – ~$150


What Will You Do If We Exceed Your Goal?
All additional funds beyond my stated goal will be used to increase my marketing budget. You will be helping me to expand visibility and promote additional sales.
If we get to $5,000, all backers will be included on a list to receive a free eBook copy of my second novel, Blank Holiday, when ready for publication. I’ll also hold the “Rocky” pose for 30 minutes atop the parking garage in Charleston, SC that inspired this novel.
What If The Goal Is Not Met?
This is a reasonable funding goal to back the publishing and marketing of my novel. I believe it is achievable (fingers crossed). If it is not met, the available funds in the campaign will still go to me (with a fee to Indiegogo). I will move forward with publishing through the distributors noted above. My marketing, travel and promo budget will have to be cut, however, limiting my reach. All backers will still receive their perks, even if the goal is not met.

<p>Sarah's journey was written by me, Imad Elabdala. I am a Syrian refugee, now based in Sweden. I have been on the same journey as Sarah, and I have seen many children whose dreams and childhoods were being destroyed in the war. I managed to settle and to get a decent job while rebuilding my life in Sweden, but the issue of those children could not leave my mind. So I put my career aside, and dedicated the last 20 months of my life to working on this book. I started by consulting professionals with the intention of developing a sustainable global tool that brings healing to traumatized children who experienced displacement. I was developing the story while volunteering at the Red Cross on the Slovenian-Croatian border in 2015 to help refugees who were coming to Europe. </p>
<p>I believe that stories can shape our personalities and identities. That is how Sarah was born.

I wrote this book because America faces a real crisis of a lack of access to care especially in rural communities, and particularly mental health care.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how telemedicine is in a position to revolutionize our approach to seeking out care. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for making health care more accessible in you.

<p><br/>The book is written in 3 Parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3.

This section dives into the details of transforming the healthcare landscape, such as the access to care, the cost of care, and the role insurance plays in this discussion.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 7-9. This section looks at leaders in the telemedicine space across political, medical, and technology landscapes.</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Anna Daccache is a candidate for a Masters of Computer Science at Northeastern’s Khoury College of Computer Science. She currently lives in San Jose, California.<br/><br/>Anna wrote this book because she has always been curious about how health care and technology can feed off of each other. She was also impassioned by her work at a health tech company that opened her eyes to the stark reality of trying to access care, especially for mental illness, in rural America, and was curious about why this wasn’t and isn’t a bigger talking point in medicine or politics.<br/><br/>Outside of graduate school and writing this book Anna is trying and surprisingly succeeding at being vegan, she's an ardent film geek, her first love was the beautiful game of football (soccer), and she is mildly obsessed with Architectural Digest house tours (check out Dakota Johnson’s for her dream home).<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Anna at amdaccache@gmail.com and on Instagram: @bananadaccache.</p>

I write books for men, but not just any books. These are high octane and high dopamine fantasy and sci-fi stories about bad ass protaganists killing asshole villians and having sex with plenty of beautiful women. If you are a dude between the ages of 16 and 99 and you are looking for books/entertainment that will make you feel like a hero, then you’ve just discovered your favorite author.</p><p> </p><p>My Space Knight novels are some of my best selling books. <i>Space Knight</i> is a story about a young man named Nicholas Lyons on his quest to become first a squire and then a knight in a fantastic sci-fi/fantasy world where Knights obtain better gear and currency by killing dragon-men-monsters named “Grendals” that emerge from portals on various planets in the galaxy. It’s a bit like <i>Harry Potter</i>, only the protaganist isn’t a third wheel, the books aren’t for kids, and lots of violence, beer drinking, and sex happens.

Take a look on the right and choose your pledge/reward perk. Your pledge will enable Space Knight Book 5 to be available on my store in ebook, audiobook, and possibly print. Thank you for pledging!Stretch goal #1 is $30,000. If we hit that in funding, I’ll make sure Space Knight Book 5 is 100,000 words instead of the usual 80,000.Stretch Goal #2 is $60,000. If we hit that funding, I’ll be able to do a mass market print run of the Space Knight books, and unsigned versions will be available in my store for fans to purchase. If that goal is not hit, there will not be print books available for sale outside of these crowdsourcing events.Ebooks, audiobooks, and other digital goodies (art and behind the scenes video) will be delivered by the end of January, print books and morale patch by the end of March.Pledgers will get advanced copies of the ebook, audio, and (if they pledge that tier) print books FOUR WEEKS before they are released to the public on my website, so if you want early access of the Space Knight story, this is the best way to get it!New for this crowdfunding campaign is the morale patch. Here is the initial design:   Hi,I’m Michael-Scott Earle, New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of fiction with 43 full-length and 4 short novels published. I write books for men, but not just any books. These are high octane and high dopamine fantasy and sci-fi stories about bad ass protaganists killing asshole villians and having sex with plenty of beautiful women. If you are a dude between the ages of 16 and 99 and you are looking for books/entertainment that will make you feel like a hero, then you’ve just discovered your favorite author. My Space Knight novels are some of my best selling books. Space Knight is a story about a young man named Nicholas Lyons on his quest to become first a squire and then a knight in a fantastic sci-fi/fantasy world where Knights obtain better gear and currency by killing dragon-men-monsters named “Grendals” that emerge from portals on various planets in the galaxy. It’s a bit like Harry Potter, only the protaganist isn’t a third wheel, the books aren’t for kids, and lots of violence, beer drinking, and sex happens. Okay… so it’s not at all like Harry Potter. Maybe it’s a bit more like Warhammer 40k, only there is romance, comedy, every other paragraph isn’t about heresy, and the characters get more loot so they get more powerful. Okay… so it’s not at all like Warhammer 40k, either.Space Knight is rather unique. It’s what is considered a “LitRPG” book, where the protagonist gets loot with stats that makes him more powerful. He also “levels” up from a lowly “Squire” into a full “Knight” class and is currently in the process of choosing a specialization.Space Knight is also considered a “Harem” novel series, where the protagonist is romantically involved and sleeps with with more than one beautiful woman who are all okay with the situation because he's so awesome.You will have a fantastic time reading this book, but don’t just take my word for it, you can download the first Space Knight novel on my website for free right now. Then you can read it on your Kindle/ebook reader/phone. If you prefer to listen to your books in the car or while you are working, you can also download the audiobook for free here.  Q: Wait. Did you just write that you do books for men? With awesome adventure, badass male protagonists, and beautiful women (like more than one?) that he sleeps with? Ummm. Are you allowed to do that? Isn’t it almost 2020?A: I understand your confusion. You probably have one eyebrow raised. Maybe you are even looking over your shoulder to make sure you don’t get caught even reading this.

Summary.
Hi. My name is Sophie Winters and I'm writing a fun and personal self-help book for women called ""The Cha Cha Club Dating Man-ifesto.""

My goal is to help women get more cha cha in their life by dishing out advice on the subjects of men, relationships, beauty, confidence and the art of difficult conversations.
I've already written the first draft. My next step is to rewrite, polish and publish the book while simultaneously building a website/blog.

<p><strong>Hello,</strong></p>
<strong>
</strong><p><strong>This campaign is to raise funds to create my first e-book., ""Operation Angelica."" I discovered creative writing as mid-life ""awakening"". The creative process has been amazing and wonderful. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong></p>
<p>FBI Sniper Elizabeth Ashton's ideal life is shattered when her fiancée is killed in<br/>Honduras, Central America. Let down by the government she serves, Ashton takes<br/>justice into her own hands. However, she soon crosses paths with a shadowy<br/>Washington D.C. consulting firm, Vormund/Ames, and is recruited to join the<br/>company. Ashton learns that sometimes governments and law enforcement agencies<br/>need an ace up the sleeve. Her first assignment is to aid in the rescue of twelve<br/>people held hostage by rebels in Columbia, South America. With the help of<br/>three very different men in her new life, Ashton begins the path to healing<br/>while the Vormund/Ames team prepares for their mission. But can they get a<br/>dying woman held prisoner for five years out in time? Can Ashton be the ace?</p>
<p><strong>Any writer can tell you that the journey from first draft to publication is a long and adventurous one. I've decided to self-publish because I feel it's the best way to showcase my work.</strong></p>
<strong>
</strong><p><strong>The funds raised through this campaign will cover the costs of a professional editor, cover designer, and initial promotion. ANY and ALL support will help! In return, contributors will get, at minimum, an electronic edition of the book and a mention on the ""Thank You"" page.

<strong>
</strong><p><strong>Through my fictional stories, I hope to give a voice to victims of violence and crime. My heroes aren't perfect, but they try to rise above personal loss and hurt in the service of others. I will dedicate this book to all soldiers, law enforcement officers, and emergency responders who risk their lives every day.</strong></p>

<h3>Mooi</h3>
<p>Het begon zo mooi, mijn vader Frans was 4 jaar oud en was het buurjongentje van mijn moeder, het is zelfs zo dat mijn vaders moeder heeft geholpen met de geboorte van mijn moeder, hierdoor heeft mijn vader de kans gekregen om over de rand van de wieg mijn moeder al op zeer jongen leeftijd mocht aanschouwen.</p>
<p>Omdat mijn moeders vader ziek was geworden voor dat ze op vakantie zouden gaan met de hele familie zijn ze inplaats van naar Italie naar mijn vaders moeder en vader gegaan, want die woonde inmiddels in Rijswijk, dat was vroeger ver weg, hierdoor kregen mijn moeder en vader weer contact en er ontstond natuurlijk een relatie, anders was ik en mijn zusje er nooit gekomen, maar voor ik en mijn zusje waren geboren begon er al een zware tijd.</p>
<h3>Ellende</h3>
<p>Mijn vader en moeder kregen al vroeg met heel veel verdriet te maken, tijdens de eerste zwangerschap ging het al mis, ze kreeg een miskraam met 9 maanden Angelique zou ze heten, het meest verschrikkelijke wat er toen gebeurde is dat het kindje direct werd meegenomen en heeft nooit in haar handen gelegen. Angelique is begraven in een anoniem stuk grond op begraafplaats Orthen en is pas een paar jaar geleden gevonden in de boeken van de begraafplaats en nu is er eindelijk een speciale gedenkplaat in begraafplaats Orthen voor deze kinderen.</p>
<p>Daarna werd Francky geboren op 6-9-1971, mijn vader en moeder dol gelukkig en mijn vader filmde veel met 8 mm film in die tijd. Het geluk werd ze helaas afgenomen door een huisarts die niet wilden luisteren en een grove inschattingsfout maakten.<br/>Die bewuste avond heeft de huisarts namelijk gezegd dat het een simpel griepje is en hij de volgende dag wel zou komen… De volgende ochtend (27-6-1973) is Francky dood aangetroffen.</p>
<p>De dood van mijn broer heeft mijn vader en moeder tot de dag van vandaag heel veel verdriet bezorgt.</p>
<p><strong>Weer een beetje vreugde</strong></p>
<p>Op 28-08-1974 werd ik geboren, Fred van Rijswijk en op 5-9-1975 werd Audrey van Rijswijk geboren, mijn zusje.</p>
<h3>Ziekte</h3>
<p>Zo'n 30 jaar geleden kreeg mijn vader, zelfstandige, een hartaanval en heeft toen in het Catherine ziekenhuis in Eindhoven een open hart operatie moeten ondergaan, toen heel moeilijk en de verwachtingen waren hooggespannen, maar heeft het doorstaan, maar is wel een stuk minder vitaal geworden, maar moest omdat ie zelfstandig was weer door met werken. Door minder te kunnen werken en wat drank problemen leven we als gezin van dag tot dag en komen we rond van minima. We hebben dit nooit erg gevonden!</p>
<p>Mijn vader is voor zijn hart nog een paar keer terug gemoeten, dotteren, stands en wederom een open hart operatie, mijn vader werd hierdoor 100% afgekeurd en mocht niet meer werken. Mijn moeder was altijd de verzorgende en toen kwamen er Melkert banen, mijn zusje werkte in de zorg op Boswijk en mijn moeder is daar aan een baan gekomen door Melkert, super trots op ons moeder, want ze stonden altijd klaar voor mensen te verzorgen, zelfs sterfbegeleiding, nu kon ze lekker de mensen in Boswijk verzorgen, Boswijk is voor demente mensen, hier kwam naar een tijdje ook haar moeder te wonen, mijn oma, haar moeder is overleden in Boswijk en kort daarna haar vader, zou bijna zeggen van verdriet, want na meer dan 60 jaar bij elkaar zijn…</p>
<h3>Kanker</h3>
<p>Een aantal daarna kreeg mijn vader weer een ziekte, kanker, om specifiek te zijn keelkanker, zware operatie tot gevolg, maar gelukkig zei de dokter hebben we alles weg kunnen snijden. Helaas moest mijn vader nog een keer onder het mes, was namelijk weer keelkanker ontdekt een jaar of wat later… Mijn vader na zoveel operaties, wist niet waarom hij het nog zou laten doen…. al die ellende, maar gelukkig waren mijn zusje en ik allebei getrouwd en hebben nu allebei 2 gezonden kinderen, ik 2 meiden Iza (6) en Lotte (4) en mijn zusje, Cem (7) en Dex (2). Dus mijn vader deed het voor ons als familie.<br/>Helaas was de 2e operatie toch nog 1 te weinig, er werd weer keel kanker ontdekt en het moest nu weer geopereerd worden.</p>
<p>Mijn moeder zorgde steeds voor mijn vader als hij weer uit het ziekenhuis kwam, door bezuinigingen en het op houden van de zogenaamde Melkert banen is mijn moeder tijdens herstel van een hernia operatie min of meer ontslagen en bedankt op 63 jarige leeftijd.</p>
<h3>Moeder</h3>
<p>Moeder die nooit ziek is en als ze ziek is nog doorgaat, ligt 's-avonds in haar bed en draait zich om, knak hoort ze en slaapt verder, in de ochtend heeft ze toch wel wat pijn in haar arm, ze gaat snel naar haar huisarts en die stuurt haar door om een foto te laten maken, snel wordt duidelijk dat het niet helemaal goed is, ze heeft haar sleutelbeen gebroken, de breuk is recht, ze kunnen aan een sleutelbeenbreuk niet veel doen, maar dat is niet het enige wat de radioloog ziet op de foto, hij ziet opvallende vlekken en met meer onderzoek direct in die week wordt al binnen 2 weken duidelijk dat ze botkanker heeft.</p>
<p>Dit hoort ze net voor de kerst (2012), verder in het onderzoek wordt duidelijk dat ze op meerdere plekken kanker ontdekken, lever (beide kanten), bekken en nog wat andere plekken, ze gaat direct aan de chemo! dapper! Ze word in januari 65 jaar, dat vieren we maar met een heel dubbel gevoel, met kerst dacht ze haar verjaardag niet te halen en vorige week heeft ze naar verschillende chemo's te horen gekregen dat de chemo niet werkt. De oncoloog die haar eerst het nieuws moet brengen dat ze er dood aangaat, moet ook nog een vertellen dat ze bij de 10% hoort waarvan ze niet weten waarvandaan het komt en dat het dus niet werkt en dus zou ze beter kunnen stoppen met de chemo en genieten van elke dag!</p>
<h3>Genieten</h3>
<p>Nu is het zo dat mijn moeder zeker geniet van alles, haar kinderen, haar kleinkinderen, naar de speeltuin, haar tuin thuis, etc. Nu zijn ze vorig jaar met (staats)steun op vakantie gemogen en gelukkig heeft ze daar volop genoten. Maar mijn moeder is de ellende zoals hierboven geprobeerd te verwoorden een beetje heel erg zat.</p>
<p>Nu is haar grote wens om als gezin, familie, nog een keer op vakantie te gaan, omdat dit nooit is gebeurt. Helaas zoals het gezegde voor een dubbeltje geboren word nooit een kwartje, kunnen we zelf dit niet financieel voor elkaar krijgen.</p>
<p>Ik wil mijn ouders nog een keer heel gelukkig zien, dat wil iedereen, maar met de 'ellende' die ze samen hebben meegemaakt wil wij dat ze nog wat wensen kan laten uitkomen.</p>
<h3>Wensen</h3>
<ul>
<li>De 8 mm filmpjes op DVD zetten, zodat ze de filmpjes van Francky en van mij en mijn zusje nog eens kan terug zien wanneer zei dat wilt.</li>
<li>Een vakantie met de hele familie, liefst naar Walt Disney, maar het maakt eigenlijk totaal niet uit, als het maar samen is!</li>
<li>Een boek schrijven, ze roept al jaren dat ze een boek zou willen schrijven, haar verhaal door een schrijver geschreven.</li>
<li>Geld doneren voor thuiszorg, mensen in nood en natuurlijk voor meer kanker onderzoek.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Ieder huisje heeft zijn kruisje</strong>,</p>
<p>ik weet dat mijn ouders absoluut niet zielig gevonden willen worden, maar omdat we financieel wij dit niet allemaal kunnen bekostigen, vragen we de hulp van iedereen in, misschien kan ik hierdoor een paar wensen van mijn moeder laten uitkomen, al is het maar de 8 mm filmpjes.</p>
<p>Ik beloof ook dat er van elke euro er een gedeelte naar een kanker stichting gaat, naar onderzoek en een gedeelte naar begeleiding van kanker patiënte.</p>
<p>Nogmaals is het best moeilijk voor mij om duidelijk te maken dat dit niet zomaar is om op vakantie te gaan, maar om echt een wens van mijn moeder uit te laten komen.</p>

Our past 31 day campaign(July 1st to August 1st) raised $13,772! AMAZING support from all of you. Thank you! We didnt meet our indiegogo goal, but we showed we can come together, and we believe in positive things. You can CLICK HERE to view the past campaign. Read the comments and see the appreciation people have for this project.  This is a $40k plus project, that we must ensure come to fruition fully and completely. This project will get done. Extremely well too with your help!
Many have called and emailed to ask how they can still contirbute and continue to give. Hence why this page and our second stage. I will be relying on you to pass the word and contribute. The next couple of months will be heavily focused on research and travel on my part. But we must continue to work on all fronts.
I encourage you over the next few days/weeks to contribute if you are able to AND share it with your friends, family and colleagues. Sharing is a great way to get the word out, but it's important to show your contribution to your friends and network as well. No amount is too small. Give what you can. Those who can and wishes to give more, usually do so, and in the end, everyone is NEEDED to make this successful. Express your passion for this project honestly and others will see it too.
Haiti is not simply deprivation and misery. We have a CULTURE, A PEOPLE AND AMAZING FOOD that the world also needs to know.
Part of Proceeds from this book will go to benefit two amazing organizations: Haiti Cultural Exchange and Community2Community, check out the phenomenal work they do.
My goal is not to innovate, it is simply to contribute. It is to bring the missing piece to a puzzle in construction.
Greetings friends, I am Nadege Fleurimond, owner and operator of Fleurimond Catering Inc. an off-premise catering company operating in NY.
 
THE PROJECT: HAITI UNCOVERED
Today, I consider myself privileged to invite you to be part of a beautiful and worthwhile project that is vital to maintaning our heritage and culture. I have worked on a lot of projects, many of them my own, but I have never felt the need, nor the desire to ask for assistance outside of my small circle of friends and collaborators. This time, this project is too important to undertake alone. I need you to be part of it.
Rarely have I been as excited about a project as I am about this one. In partnership with you, I want to create, a Culinary Coffee Table Book that embraces every region and tradition of Haiti. Haiti Uncovered: A Regional Adventure into the Art of Haitian Cuisine will bring into focus the beauty of Haiti through its diverse culinary traditions. The beautifully bound and illustrated, hard cover book, slated to be released in early 2014, will present and represent the dishes and cooking traditions from the major geographical Departments. 
 
The book will have an English as well as a French Version making it accessible to individuals all over the globe. 
Author Edwidge Danticat is excited about this project and will be writing the forward for the book. 
Why This Book Needs to be Created?
In my opinion, Food is perhaps one of the most important things within a culture. As Regine Roumain, Executive Director of Haiti Cultural Exchange states, ""It is an important and vital aspect of our cultural heritage and one I think should be preserved. Everything having to do with food from the preparation to the cultivation to the way we eat altogether is a cultural act. Food is culture""
Fan Fan TiBot, Founding member and Manager of Tabou Combo, also states, ""Haitians are known for music and mostly painting. But not for our cuisine. Based on our different colinization, I think Haiti has the most culturally diversified cuisine in the Caribbean. I like the project because it promotes our culture""
Showcasing Haiti has been at the forefront of everything that I have done to this point in my life and my career.  I want to use the skills that I have been blessed with to leave behind something that is needed.
Haiti Uncovered will be a book that Haitians born in Haiti can reference to learn about other parts of the country.
Haitians and Haitian-Americans in the Diaspora can learn the real breadth and scope  of Haitian cuisine . Not just Du riz ak pwa. This sense that Haitian food is limited, is a fallacy. 
When Non-Haitians are interested in learning about Haiti, Haitian culture, and what the culinary culture of Haiti is really about, they can google, and find Haiti Uncovered, that gives a true depiction of the reality.
I read on an internet blog once, about someone who had moved to Haiti and they wrote, ""Haitians put ketchup and sugar in their spaghetti. Haitians really like sweet foods. They put sugar in everything."" 
That statement really bothered me because, while I may not know our full culinary tradition, one I am very clear about is, we do not like sweet and savory flavors for the most part, yet, the people reading this woman's blog would use her thoughts as a reference, and there is nothing out there to counter that. 
We need to change that. We need to ensure that we have a complete and well presented piece of writing that will serve as a culinary, cultural and historical reference for Haiti.
 
Haiti Uncovered can serve people all over the world who are interested in a creating a sort of cultural exchange. 
However, I can’t do this alone. Only a true and complete collaborative effort on many fronts can make that possible. Therefore, I need you. I need your backing and encouragement. Together, we will produce something that we can all be proud of. This book, with your participation, will become the culinary reference for Haitians and non-Haitians alike who are interested in Haitian Cuisine.
Why Do I Need You on this Journey?  
I want you to love this project as much as I do. I want you to travel the course with me. Such an undertaking will require extensive travelling and research throughout the country to speak with the people, discover and study the recipes, so that they can be reported as accurately as possible to you and the world. It will feature not only beautiful photographs of dishes and recipes, but will also include photographs of the people and will reveal in detail their food traditions, as well as locally grown ingredients. Haiti Uncovered: A Regional Adventure into the Art of Haitian Cuisine is a book that will present an accurate depiction of Haiti's culinary art. In essence, this is your chance to rediscover Haiti and to present her in a different light.
What Your Financial Support Will Mean:
 
27,500 is the minimum needed to get this project going in the right direction. However the project costs are well over $40,000. Proper research and travelling will be necessary to capture the rich culinary heritage of Haiti. 
What does a day look like in Jacmel when looked through a food inspired lens? 
What do the people of Jeremie eat on Sundays? 
What is the festival or street food culture in Cap-Haitien? 
Wedding foods of Miragoane?
From religion to other societal components, what role does food play in the lives of Haitian. 
By contributing financially to the realization of this Book Project, you will permit the hiring of knowledgable and competent  professionals in all relams. From videographers, copy editors, researches, historians to the photographers that wil capture the people, the dishes and the agricultural back drop of the country. 
 
Even in presenting this video to you and bringing this project to your attention, we wanted to do our best to bring something of quality. We want to continue on this path. Research has to be done and we need to go to Haiti. Numerous times. We need to visit various regions to perform adequate researchproperly document data.  We will need to print this book and more importantly, we will need to ensure that the marketing and publicity campaigns are well developed and carried out. Your contribution will make all that possible. 
We also have some great perks available for your generosity.  Check them out!
What the Book Means  
For many Haitian descents and foreigners, Haitian food means Rice and Beans, Fried chicken, Tasso (seasoned fried goat), Griot (seasoned fried pork), fried fish with the occasional fried plantain. 
 
But Haitian Food, well Haitian Cuisine is much more than those common dishes. It is also Tom tom, bouyon tèt kabrit, tchaka, and ragou pyé bèf. It is pitimi ak pwa, soup joumou, pwason gwo sèl, lalo, blé, labouyi banana, doukounou, mousa, koukoush, and much more. 
 
It is also dessert items like dous kokoyé, chanmchanm, konparèt, dous makòs, tablèt nwa, tablet pistach, pain patate, gato manyok, bon bon sirop, beignet, and a lot more. 
 
Think of learning about Cachiman, Corossol, kenep, mango, sapoti, lam veritab, labapen, acajou, and Djon djon, among others. 
 
We want to represent the daily culinary experience of those in Jeremie, Gonaives, Les Cayes, Cap-Haitien, Jacmel, Port-de-Paix and others. We want to know the people. We want to know their food traditions, so we can perhaps pass down to our children. 
 
With this book, we have a chance to represent our cuisine and traditions the right way and in context of our history and reality.
 
How much will all of this Project Cost us?
The project cost ranges from $40,000.00 to $60,000 depending on how extensive we want to make this. I have thought of adding a DVD Guide along with the book. However, all of that depends on how much we are able to raise.  I have already secured $8,000.00 in commitment towards the printing of the Book. I have committed $11,000 of my own funds towards this endeavor, however, I cannot do it alone. I am coming to you and the Indiegogo community for atleast $27, 500.00 as I continue to search for the money to make this project as amazing as it deserves to be.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The friendly curmudgeon Don Smudge has succinctly formulated the nine steps to figuring things out in life. And I'd love to spread his wisdom to the ends of the modern universe. This concise pocket guide is filled with sharp-tongued humor and epiphanies everyone can understand and apply to life immediately upon reading it.</p>
</div><div><p><br/></p></div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Before a single word can be printed, we need to get the first pressing set up. And that costs money. By contributing to Don Smudge's first self-help pocket guide, you essentially are pre-ordering your very own limited edition hand-numbered copy of How to F**king Figure Things Out. You may also order one for you to keep and one to give as a gift for someone who really needs to figure things out. I mean, really does. And if that special copy is too much fanfare, plop down a finski and put in a pre-order for the regular dude's version, to be printed at a future date yet to be determined.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
The friendly curmudgeon Don Smudge has succinctly formulated the nine steps to figuring things out in life. And I'd love to spread his wisdom to the ends of the modern universe. This concise pocket guide is filled with sharp-tongued humor and epiphanies everyone can understand and apply to life immediately upon reading it.

What We Need & What You Get
Before a single word can be printed, we need to get the first pressing set up. And that costs money. By contributing to Don Smudge's first self-help pocket guide, you essentially are pre-ordering your very own limited edition hand-numbered copy of How to F**king Figure Things Out. You may also order one for you to keep and one to give as a gift for someone who really needs to figure things out. I mean, really does. And if that special copy is too much fanfare, plop down a finski and put in a pre-order for the regular dude's version, to be printed at a future date yet to be determined.

<p>My campaign is geared toward funding my next collection of poetry that I have entitled “Dope on the Road”.  It is a chronicle of all of my travels, and there are many.  Traveling has been a constant theme in my life and I intend on capturing the uniqueness of my experiences.  My love of the road and traveling are the main themes and extend some themes that I touched on in ‘Wallflowers Aloof”.</p>
<p>I have two other collections started in addition to the two I have mentioned.  These funds would help me to continue to write more abundantly and free me from the retail shackles that I currently find myself tied to.  With each new book that I publish it will increase my income and allow me to be less dependent on regular work, or having to ask for help as I am doing here.  This is the first push toward me making a living on my own terms and producing something more important than consumer fodder.  I am seeking creative independence!</p>
<p>For anyone that makes any type of donation there will be a free E-version of ‘Wallflowers Aloof’ for download on Amazon.  In addition to the download I will include several other perks for more generous contributors.  Included will be autographed copies of individual poems, printed copies of ‘Wallflowers Aloof’, printed copies of ‘Dope on the Road’, autographed copies of the books, and for two lucky contributors; the original cover artwork from ‘Dope on the Road’ and ‘Wallflowers Aloof’.  Please see the perks list for specific details.</p>
<p>If my entire goal is not met I will still be a little more independent.  Regardless of meeting my goal or not I will use these funds to subsidize my living expenses so that I can spend more time writing than selling shoes. </p>
<p>My poetic style is very unique; I have worked extremely hard to develop my own voice and message.  I enjoy exposing the status quo and exploring emotional sentiments that rarely make it to the page.  I hesitated to show my work to anyone for many years, and now that I have people are reacting very positively.  One of my poems literally brought a woman to tears.  I have never received a better compliment.  For anyone that is interested I will be happy to send a sample of my work. </p>
<p>For those of you who cannot afford a fiscal contribution you can still help!!!  Help get the word out about my project, and this campaign.  Use the Indiegogo share tools to share with your friends on Facebook and Twitter.  Please encourage your friends to repost your posts and the word will spread even faster.  I consider this a form of contribution and I am willing to allow anyone that helps in any way to get in on the free E-book of ‘Wallflowers Aloof’.  In addition I will make everyone that helps in this way aware of the release date for a free E-version of ‘Dope on the Road’ once it is completed.</p>
<p>Thank you for spending the time to read through my campaign, and thank you in advance for any help you have provided.  This really does mean the world to me.  As my way of giving back I intend on helping Indiegogo projects as often as I can in the future.</p></div>","My name is David McCracken, I am a poet.  My formal background is in Art, primarily painting, however I have been writing poetry longer than I have been an artist.  I started writing when I was a sophomore in high school to pass away the doldrums of secondary education.  I also used poetry as a means to dump my emotional garbage as I have a tendency to write away my frustrations and aggravation.  I often refer to my poetry as emotional self portraits.  My first collection of poetry; “Wallflowers Aloof” is being published by Bootstrap Publishing of Rochester, New York and will be available soon.

<p>Your child will be delighted with these stories of a young donkey from Prince Edward Island.  In Book 1, Donkey Oatie's Impossible Dream - he wants to be a cow.  In the second book, he considers painted hoofs, earrings and other fashions before deciding that he is better off staying as he is.  In the third, he visits other animal friends in his Field Trip.</p>
<p>I've published KittenCat Adventures and other books, but this new series has me really excited, thanks in great part to the images created by budding illustrator Gregory MacAdam.</p>

<p><b>A Book for the Global Movement to Transform Suffering with Diversity &amp; Racism Issues</b></p>

<li>
<p class=""gmail_quote"">I am seeking to synthesize many learning experiences I’ve shared with everyday human beings, renowned authors &amp; the world’s leading Change Agents in diversity, transforming racism, nonviolence, restorative justice, Integral Theory &amp; Evolutionary Spirituality and inquire into a wide range of styles and approaches to look at this conversation in a holistic way and support a global transformation of suffering in relation to diversity &amp; racism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=""gmail_quote"">It is a book about looking at the beautiful possibility of the spiritual vision of Oneness &amp; Unity Consciousness on the planet and also being a model of seeking to bridge communication gaps by sharing my own human vulnerability and exploring my own traps and tests in thinking I’ve transcended racism and still learn how to meet life where it is on the ground.  As Lee Mun Wah says, ""The cure is in the pain.""</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=""gmail_quote"">The book is aimed to lovingly inspire conscious and awakening people seeking spiritual growth &amp; community to mindfully include this conversation in life-serving ways with our works as Change Agents and pragmatically co-create a world that works for all, in everyday life.</p>

Support the forward flowing inspiration of Clayton Barker, a 28 year-old, loving, visionary youth leader and budding writer & author, committed to be the change he wishes to see in the world. 


In the next 4 years, I seek to be a loving, effective, nonviolent and pragmatic stand for co-creating a world free from suffering, in relation to issues of diversity and racism, co-holding a vision of compassionate justice systems on Earth.  It is vulnerable to be this stand, yet it is true aliveness coming through me so I'm willing to keep walking into the unknown and co-create unity in diversity.



Currently, as an apprentice peace maker and writer, I am embarking on a year long experiential book research project & global co-creative service learning journey based in Dialogues about Diversity & Transforming Racism, Nonviolent Communication and Restorative Circles.




I feel sacred urgency about the suffering that exists on the planet and in my own communities, in relation to violence, painful conflicts, and punishment based justice systems struggling with issues of diversity and racism.  I want to learn how to embody transformational leadership in practical ways by giving voice to our present day reality.



I am dissatisfied with 2,000,000 + people living in prison in the USA, almost 90% of them are people of color.  I've got work to do and a hopeful, visionary book to write.


I am uncomfortable with the reality that I am 4 times less likely to be arrested than a black male in the US. I've got work to do and a solution oriented book to write.


I am pained that First Nations Communities like the Lakota Pine Ridge Reservation have a 90% unemployment rate.  I've got work to do and a constructive book to write.


This emerging book is my personal learning journey of integrating wisdom from over 70 life teachers, reflecting on my own breakdowns & breakthroughs, uncovering my own blind spots, interviewing leading (r)evolutionary change agents and integrating reality-based community feedback.  




 
Short Term Impacts in 2011 & Where Will Your Money Go?
It's a joyful privilege to be doing book research for this project, participating in co-learning and co-facilitation and at the same time being a channel for the redistribution and reallocation of money resources towards the visions and missions of these inspiring peace-building organizations!
 
US $5625.00 goes straight to Bay Area Nonviolent Communication and the 2011 N. American NVC Leadership Program for mentoring my learning and book research, help others have access to scholarships, and gives livelihood to NVC trainers and organizers.
 
US $500.00 goes straight to the Joy Living & Learning Center in Auroville, India to build a bamboo/palm hut for NVC volunteers/learners/trainers to stay in when they pass through South India and supports local eco-builders with income and much needed livelihood to feed families!  I will stay there, work on the book and donate it to the future! This will also support me being able to offer The Wake Up with other youth leaders in India from Chennai in Tamil Nadu.
 
US $125.00 goes straight to Institute of NVC in India so I can pay them to co-facilitate and off-set scholarships for others in India who want access to NVC training!
 
US $1900.00 goes straight towards honoring an invitation to travel to the Institute of Nonviolent Communication of India Convention in February 2011 and offer my experience of Nonviolent Communication (NVC) and Restorative Circles (RC) (with out me setting fees or suggesting sliding scales for my contribution).
 
$US 1000.00 goes straight towards honoring an invitation to facilitate at the Panya Permaculture Project & the Metta Experiment in Chiang Mai, Thailand in March & April 2011 with CNVC Certified Trainer Jack Lehman and do living book research while co-creating learning experiences in Nonviolent Communication (NVC) and Restorative Circles (RC) (with out me setting fees or sliding scales for my contribution).
 
US $750.00 goes straight to NVC trainer, Roxy Manning who co-founded the NVC & Diversity Project for her travel and honorarium so we can have the opportunity to co-facilitate a day long dialog of NVC & Diversity & Transforming Racism in July 2011 at the year long NVC based leadership program in Seattle called ""A Path of Compassion & Empowerment"" hosted by CNVC Trainers Karl Steyaert & Kathleen MacFerran.
 
US $1100.00 goes straight to honoring an invitation to apprentice along side with Kathryn Ssedoga from the Restorative Circles Learning Community and learn about what she and First Nations, Spoken Word & Street Communities are co-creating with Restorative Circles in her home town in Guelph, Ontario, Canada.
 
Travel to NVC Family Camp 2011 on Vashon Island in Washington, USA to offer my heart and presence without me setting fees or requested and suggested sliding scales for my work.
 
The rest of the money we generate for this project ""pays forward"" these these other co-learning experiences: http://cocreatingconnection.
 
*** Other than the plane flights to India and Thailand, I am committed to taking public transportation, riding trains, walking, riding bicycles, hitch hiking, carpooling, and using Craig's List for ride shares as much as possible to practice living more regeneratively with Earth.

A Book for the Global Movement to Transform Suffering with Diversity & Racism Issues



I am seeking to synthesize many learning experiences I’ve shared with everyday human beings, renowned authors & the world’s leading Change Agents in diversity, transforming racism, nonviolence, restorative justice, Integral Theory & Evolutionary Spirituality and inquire into a wide range of styles and approaches to look at this conversation in a holistic way and support a global transformation of suffering in relation to diversity & racism.


It is a book about looking at the beautiful possibility of the spiritual vision of Oneness & Unity Consciousness on the planet and also being a model of seeking to bridge communication gaps by sharing my own human vulnerability and exploring my own traps and tests in thinking I’ve transcended racism and still learn how to meet life where it is on the ground.  As Lee Mun Wah says, ""The cure is in the pain.""


The book is aimed to lovingly inspire conscious and awakening people seeking spiritual growth & community to mindfully include this conversation in life-serving ways with our works as Change Agents and pragmatically co-create a world that works for all, in everyday life.




The emerging book is presently being called:

 
Being in in the Integral Nonviolence Birth Canal: ""A White Youth Leader's Life Experiment in Synthesizing & Co-creating Conversations on Diversity & Transforming Racism 
and Co-Holding a Vision of Building Compassionate Justice Systems on Earth.""
 


Total Pollination Funds to Awaken this Project by February 4th, 2011: $11,224 


The total current 2011 budget for this project is $12,126 and I have already co-manifested and co-generated $902.00 as of 1/3/2011.  Woo hoo!


I have a multi-tier FUNdraising strategy that includes: regular fundraising coaching sessions, a letter writing campaign to friends and networks, co-creating NVC workshop FUNdraisers with a # of CNVC Certified Trainers, doing one-on-one empathy coaching calls with clients on a sliding scale basis, launching this Indie Go Go campaign, door to door FUNdraising, tabling at the local community market, making bold requests of individuals that I meet that are inspired by what I am up, online donation button on my website, and limiting belief transformation.


 
What Happens If We EXCEED the FULL GOAL of $11,224Indie Go Go?


ALL surplus monies donated will be gifted to the NVC & Diversity Project in July 2011 for the scholarship fund to nurture the possibility that all those who want to have access to the retreat can do so with ease and grace.

IndieGoGo gets 4% fee for hosting this project which supports over 15,000 commuity & creativity projects around the globe to live their dreams in the wolrd. 
 


What Happens If We Don't Meet the Full Goal of $11,224 on Indie Go Go?


Indie Go Go, takes 9% the money that comes in and the Being in the Integral Nonviolence Birth Canal project will keep the rest and share it with the other organizations (read more about how, below).


Because I have committments with 5 organizations, I am prioritizing travel FUNding to get to India and Thailand to honor the invitations there to co-create Nonviolent Communication & Restorative Circle learning experiences.

I am planning to FUNd the projects based on the sequential time frame in the itinerary of the project.  Because I offer my experience in workshops without any set fees or suggested sliding scales, I live life in the ""pay it forward paradigm"" and really appreciate community financial co-responsibility to keep giving my gifts in the world. 

Please help me to keep my research/learning/contribution dreams alive and thriving by redistributing resources towards Bay NVC, 2011 N.American NVC Leadership Program, NVC Family Camp, Institute of Nonviolent Communication in India, The Joy Living & Learning Center in India,  Kathryn Ssedoga of the Restorative Circles Learning Community, & Roxy Manning of the NVC & Diversity Program!

<p>In order to do this, we need about $1,500. We managed to raise $879 in a previous <strong>campaign, </strong>and now we're trying to raise the difference.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The total amount we're trying to raise is $1,500 but the truth is, the actual amount is closer to $1,300 because of PayPal and Indiegogo fees.</p>
<p>And the first (and most important) thing to consider when crowdfunding a book is the cost of the perks. The cost of books, the cost of shipping, and all that.</p>
<p>Just to give you an idea: it costs something like $10 (maybe even a bit more) to order a paperback from Createspace and ship it to wherever the person who wants it lives. The perk costs $20, but we receive something like $17 after PayPal and Indiegogo take their cut.</p>
<p>That’s a $7 profit, and it's less than half.</p>
<p>So let’s say that in the end, we’re left with more than half. Let’s say $800.</p>
<p>That’s just enough to pay for editing, or if we get a good deal, we’re left with something like $200. And, yes, you need your book professionally edited. This is not the internet, this is something you’re asking money for, so it has to be as grammatically correct as possible.</p>
<p>Now comes the tricky part: the money wouldn’t be enough if I wouldn’t be able to design covers and format interiors for e-books and paperbacks. The work I do, that’s at least $500 in the world of freelance graphic designers. At least. Createspace charges more just for a professionally looking cover.</p>
<p>So, yes, we can get a book released, and we also get to use the remaining $200 for marketing and promoting, which means paying for ads on relevant websites such as Goodreads, hosting giveaways and contests. Stuff like that. I don’t think there’s really a need to go crazy when it comes to spending on marketing and promoting a self-published novel.</p>
<p>That’s pretty much why we need the money, what we need it for, and how we want to proceed.</p>
<p>In return for your contributions you'll receive e-books, mentions in the book, signed paperbacks, and prints of the cover artwork. And the oh-so-good feeling of having helped us out.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is kind of like asking us, ""Why do you write?""</p>
<p>Well, we write because we want to change something in this world. We write because there are so many thinks we'd like to say and sometimes there's no one to listen. We write because there are some things we would never dare say out loud.</p>
<p>This is what's at stake. We want our voices heard, and only you can make it happen.</p>

<h3><strong><em>Why We Need Your Help</em></strong></h3>
<p>We need your help!  <em>A Veteran's Legacy</em> is a journal designed with prompting questions, space to answer and share stories, pictures and other history that ensures American veterans' stories are told today and to future generations. The journal also aids in helping to heal our nation's veterans by providing a format that is easy to follow and has been effective in aiding the healing process of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).    </p>
<p>We have a first run of the journals that are ready to be shipped to combat wounded veterans and are currently being used in programs across the country to help in the healing process of PTSD, etc.  However, we need your help to help us SHIP the remaining journals to veterans free of charge! The vision for this project from the very beginning was to provide this tool for FREE to the veterans as a way for us (and You!) to say THANK YOU for their service.  </p>
<p>Additionally, we have found that the journal needs to be self published to give us greater control over the creativity, accessibility, and marketing of the journal.  Our goal is to self publish the second edition and add additional creative elements which includes a family member section, places for pictures, etc.; but also, the second edition will be available online in a format that can be accessed by the user whether they are sigt impaired or have impaired mobility (arms, hands, etc.).  </p>
<p>Funding this project is the ULTIMATE way to say thank you to our veterans and to get a tool in their hands that will help heal and also share stories so that we can then turn them into living history through various art forms (photography, songs, books, artwork, etc.)</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">As we have seen with the first run, once a veteran and/or family member is aware of this tool, they then ask, “What can be done with our stories and pictures?” Veterans Legacy is already equipped to capture any story or picture and then turn that into “Living Histories” through art, live events, music, other books and/or film. There are examples of those below.  </span></p>
<p>These journals are unique.  They are the only tangible tool to capture every veteran’s story and also say “Thank You” in a meaningful way to those who serve.   Please help us self publish more of these journals and deliver to those veterans who need them most.  </p>
<p><strong>CLICK ON THE VIDEO</strong> above to hear portions of stories from different generations and from supporters of this project about the benefits of this journal and <em>HOW YOU CAN HELP!</em> Be sure to see the rewards section for some really cool stuff you can earn at different levels! Thank you for doing your part!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If everyone on our email list was able to donate $10, that would get at least ONE journal into the hands of a combat wounded veteran immediately. PLUS, it would help us with our goal of self-publishing the second edition and building the infrastructure for sight and mobile impairment access. </p>

<h2><strong>The Story of ""A Veteran's Legacy""</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>The ""Spark""</strong></h3>
<div>
<p><em>A Veterans Legacy Journal</em><em> </em>started over 20 years ago when, as a senior art student at the University of Kentucky, I drew a picture of nine soldiers in Vietnam (drawing below). That drawing sparked a life-long love for honoring our country’s veterans in new and creative ways. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Vietnam"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://veteranslegacyjournal.com/images/art02.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Nine Men in Vietnam""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the course of the last two decades I have realized the power of veterans' pictures and stories. It became clear that there is not only an urgency in capturing these experiences before they are lost,  but there is real healing that takes place when those pictures and stories are transformed into other forms (art, music, film and/ or books) and shared.  </p>
<p><strong><em>Big Doors Swing on Little Hinges</em></strong></p>
<p>In 2007,  I met two veterans who galvanized this project into what it is today, Gerald Belcher (US Army – Vietnam) and Joe Lane (USMC – WWII).</p>
<p>At a picnic one summer evening, I found myself sitting next to Vietnam veteran Gerald Belcher talking about our mutual interest in art and the military.  He asked me to come to his office the next day to consider drawing a picture from Vietnam that meant more to him “than anything in the world.”</p>
<p>When we met the next day he showed me this picture (picture below is the drawing).</p>
<p><img alt=""Gerald Belcher Vietnam"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://veteranslegacyjournal.com/images/art06.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Gerald Belcher - Vietnam""/></p>
<p>He explained that, while the expression on his face was calm and collected, he was actually in a moment of sheer terror as he and his friend we trapped behind this earthen mound and were receiving heavy enemy fire.  He continued explaining that they didn’t know what to do,  but realized they had a camera and Gerald said, “why don’t we just take a picture of each other in case one of us doesn’t make it out.”</p>
<p>It was at that moment, I realized that each veteran has a story or a picture that no one else will ever know unless they share it.  There needed to be a way take veterans' best pictures/ stories and turn them into a new and creative way of sharing with others.  I thought the answer was producing a handsome coffee-table type book full of veterans best pictures and stories.</p>
<p><strong><em>THEN I MET JOE LANE! </em></strong></p>
<p>Joe Lane and I met at a lunch honoring the remaining Pearl Harbor Survivors in our community later that year.  Joe had served in the Marine Corp during WWII and had seen combat in such places as Guadalcanal, Saipan and Iwo Jima.  He invited me to his home to talk about my project and to share his personal memories and memorabilia.</p>
<p>We spent 4 hours together that first day going through stacks of pictures and talking about the stories of his WWII experience.  It was then I realized, “Who am I to attempt to figure out the most meaningful picture and story from this man’s life?”</p>
<p><strong><em>The “AH HA Moment”</em></strong></p>
<p>It was upon leaving Joe’s house that I realized this project was different.    The project was to produce a journal for veterans of any generation to capture their personal experiences.  It was to be designed in a “Question and Answer” type format with a prompting question and plenty of room to answer.  The book should also have ample space for additional comments, pictures, maps, etc.</p>
<p>A Veterans Legacy Journal was born that day!</p>
<p><strong><em>2010 to Today</em></strong></p>
<p>The first run of these journals was produced in 2010.  Since then, we have seen amazing results.  Veterans and their families have truly appreciated and treasured the opportunity for a safe place to tell their stories.</p>
<p><img alt=""Veterans Legacy Journal"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://veteranslegacyjournal.com/images/header.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Veterans Legacy Journal ""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have also seen these journals have a tremendous healing effect on the emotional wounds of war.  Research has consistently shown that the positive impact of journaling reduces the damage of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  These journals not only provide a tangible means of saying “Thank You” for serving our county to a veteran, but are also very effective in helping heal (whether that is as an individual, a family or a nation).</p>
<p>These journals have also sparked an amazing stream of stories and pictures flowing back to us to be considered for future art, music, books and films.</p>
<h2><strong>And then there was, <br/>“Wedding Day Kiss” and “Ghost”</strong></h2>
<h3><em>THIS 3-FOLD STORY DEMONSTRATES THE PROJECT’S POWER AND IMPACT!</em></h3>
<p>As pictures and stories flowed into Veterans Legacy, the picture below with its amazing story found its way to the project.</p>
<h3>""Wedding Day Kiss"" <br/>Dale &amp; Kenneth Johnson's Wedding Day<br/>July 1944</h3>
<p><strong>Part 1 - <em>An Iconic Picture</em></strong></p>
<p>The picture is of my wife’s grandparents on their wedding day in rural Kentucky in 1944.  The story goes that just a few days after their wedding, he was shipped off for over a year of separation from her to fight in some of the most intense combat in Europe during WWII.  He returned home after the war to raise their family and they remained married until her death for 47 years.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2 – <em>Saving History</em></strong></p>
<p>In 1991, my wife’s grandmother passed away. She and her grandfather were going through pictures and came across this one.  When she asked about it, he gave her the details but said for her to put it back in the stack with the other old pictures and letters.  When he wasn’t looking, she slipped the picture into her pocket.  Fortunately for all of us she did because after he buried his wife, her grandfather burned all those old pictures, letters and stories to fulfill a promise he made to his wife to keep that part of their lives private.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3 – <em>Transformation to Inspiration</em></strong></p>
<p>In 2011, I saw this picture and was moved to draw it as an original piece of art to give my wife as a present.  Once the artwork was completed, the image and story began to inspire other veteran couples to share their pictures and love stories with the project.  But who knew there would be something even more amazing to come from this image.</p>
<p>In 2012, a singer-song writer friend shared lyrics from a song he had created a few years prior.  Those lyrics were perfectly written to tell the story of my wife’s grandfather.  That song, ""Ghost"" recounts a World War II veteran asking the question if this current generation will remember the sacrifices he and the other WWII veterans made.  ""Ghost"" has been recorded and will soon be available on iTunes but you can receive a free download at various rewards levels.</p>
<p>This is what “A Veterans Legacy” is all about.  Prompting stories to be captured and then turning those stories into new ways to share them with a wide audience.</p>
<h2><strong><em>The Newest Way to Honor Veterans<br/>Veterans Legacy Night (Live and Virtually)</em></strong></h2>
<p>In November 2012, Lexington, Kentucky created and hosted the very first Veterans Legacy Night.  This event packed the house to honor those who serve our country, to hear live interviews with veterans from across the generations, to witness the debut of “Ghost,” and rocked out with Grammy Award Winner John Elefante (former lead singer of Kansas), all the while raising awareness for specific groups assisting our military!</p>
<p>Please take a moment and back this project at any level and share this project with your networks, facebook, twitter, etc.  Help us get the word out and find as many backers as possible! </p>
<p>Thank you for supporting this important project. And, more importantly, Thank you for expressing your appreciation to the Veterans and currently serving military service members that continue to keep our nation free. </p>
</div></div>","Why We Need Your Help
We need your help!  A Veteran's Legacy is a journal designed with prompting questions, space to answer and share stories, pictures and other history that ensures American veterans' stories are told today and to future generations. The journal also aids in helping to heal our nation's veterans by providing a format that is easy to follow and has been effective in aiding the healing process of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).    
We have a first run of the journals that are ready to be shipped to combat wounded veterans and are currently being used in programs across the country to help in the healing process of PTSD, etc.  However, we need your help to help us SHIP the remaining journals to veterans free of charge! The vision for this project from the very beginning was to provide this tool for FREE to the veterans as a way for us (and You!) to say THANK YOU for their service.  
Additionally, we have found that the journal needs to be self published to give us greater control over the creativity, accessibility, and marketing of the journal.  Our goal is to self publish the second edition and add additional creative elements which includes a family member section, places for pictures, etc.; but also, the second edition will be available online in a format that can be accessed by the user whether they are sigt impaired or have impaired mobility (arms, hands, etc.).  
Funding this project is the ULTIMATE way to say thank you to our veterans and to get a tool in their hands that will help heal and also share stories so that we can then turn them into living history through various art forms (photography, songs, books, artwork, etc.)
As we have seen with the first run, once a veteran and/or family member is aware of this tool, they then ask, “What can be done with our stories and pictures?” Veterans Legacy is already equipped to capture any story or picture and then turn that into “Living Histories” through art, live events, music, other books and/or film. There are examples of those below.  
These journals are unique.  They are the only tangible tool to capture every veteran’s story and also say “Thank You” in a meaningful way to those who serve.   Please help us self publish more of these journals and deliver to those veterans who need them most.  
CLICK ON THE VIDEO above to hear portions of stories from different generations and from supporters of this project about the benefits of this journal and HOW YOU CAN HELP! Be sure to see the rewards section for some really cool stuff you can earn at different levels! Thank you for doing your part!
What We Need & What You Get
If everyone on our email list was able to donate $10, that would get at least ONE journal into the hands of a combat wounded veteran immediately. PLUS, it would help us with our goal of self-publishing the second edition and building the infrastructure for sight and mobile impairment access. 
Be sure to see the rewards section for some really great rewards!  
When fully funded, half of the funds will be used to ship the remaining inventory to combat wounded veterans for immediate use in healing and therapy programs across the country.  The other half of the funds will be used to build the online infrastructure and the second edition of the journal. Plus, fees for this sight, credit card processing fees, and rewards expenses will also be used when fully funded.  
The Impact

There are millions of veterans today and many of these veterans are suffering from the emotional wounds of war, PTSD, physical impairments, etc. Journaling has been proven to help heal emotional wounds.  This journal is designed with prompting questions and space to capture answers to the questions, space to share stories, and share history.  This jounal can help them heal from these emotional battle scars. Not only is this journal a healing agent, it's also a way to start capturing all the stories that could be lost before they are told.  A Veteran's Legacy has a way to capture those stories and then turn them back out as living history in various art forms.  
We have already been successful in getting thousands of these journals into the hands of veterans who need them the most and have seen and heard countless stories of how valuable this journal is as a healing tool.  Help us get these journals out now in the tens and hundreds of thousands.  
This is a project that you can be sure that your support is an exponential impact in honoring veterans, helping them heal, and creating an appropriate place to remember.

<p>Can a book do much to restore health to the American political
system? </p>
<p>Such things do not happen often, but it is because I see a real
chance of accomplishing this that I’ve felt driven to write a new book, <b>WHAT
WE’RE UP AGAINST</b>. </p>
<p>That scenario requires that enough like-minded people pitch in
to help. </p>
<p>Are you one of those people?</p>
<p>• 
Are you outraged by the way the right-wing force is systematically damaging our
nation?</p>
<p>• 
Are you frustrated by the weakness of the response from the liberal side?</p>
<p>• 
Do you sense the profundity of America’s present national crisis?</p>
<p><b>WHAT WE’RE UP AGAINST</b> tackles this crisis head on, and shows how we
can turn this dangerous political dynamic around.</p>
<p>• 
It shows how the Republican Party has been taken over by a destructive force
that threatens a future where the many are exploited by the few, the lie
defeats the truth, and democracy is but a memory. Showing how such forces arise
and operate in societies like ours, WHAT WE’RE UP AGAINST explains how a
once-great party has become unlike anything ever seen before at center stage of
American politics. </p>
<p>• 
It also shows how the response from Liberal America has been woefully weak --
wholly inadequate to protect the nation. WHAT WE’RE UP AGAINST shows how a
major part of that weakness stems from a dangerous kind of blindness—an
inability to perceive and understand what we are up against.</p>
<p>I’ve addressed this book to Liberal America, to correct that
blindness and to ignite the necessary fire that will give us strength we need. </p>
<p><b>WHAT WE’RE UP AGAINST </b>both trumpets a call to battle and provides a
strategy for winning.</p>
<p>This crisis is the fruit of things gone awry throughout the
American body politic. But it’s a serious mistake to think of it in terms of
‘both sides do it.’ While both sides of our political divide play a role in
this crisis, their defects are opposites. The Right insists on fighting over
everything even when the national good requires cooperation, while liberals
have been reluctant to fight over anything, even when the defense of what's
best in America would require them to do battle.</p>
<p>I know that for many in Liberal America, the notion of doing
battle – even non-violent battle – is repugnant. But the alternative in America
today is much worse. The stakes – for us, for our children and grandchildren,
for our imperiled planet – could not be higher.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal for <b>WHAT WE’RE UP AGAINST</b> – improbable, but quite
plausible enough to warrant an all-out effort – is to get the message of this
book into the national conversation in time to influence the 2016 election
process. That requires that the book reach its target audience quickly. </p>
<p>It is the need for speed that induced me, after more than thirty
years of being published by reputable commercial houses and university presses,
to self-publish WHAT WE’RE UP AGAINST. But self-publishing means we have to
create, on our own, the marketing muscle that a big publishing house would have
provided. Add to that the ambition for this book – to catalyze a political
movement – and the need becomes that much bigger.</p>
<p>Accomplishing this requires spreading the word.<span>  And spreading the word takes money, and it
takes people pitching in with their energy and their creativity.</span></p>
<p>So we need your financial help. And as a sign of appreciation
for such a contribution, you will receive an advance copy of <b>WHAT WE’RE UP
AGAINST</b>. (Larger contributions get larger rewards, as described in the
“Perks” section.)<span> <br/></span></p>
<p>And we need capable people to lend a hand. </p>
<p>The more help we get, the better our chance of helping turn around
the toxic political dynamic of our times.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>
There’s a battle going on in America over the
destiny of our nation. It is a battle that must be fought and must be won. In
terms of impact on this battle, there’s a good chance that there’s no place you
can get more bang for your buck than in supporting <span>the effort to get
<b>WHAT WE’RE UP AGAINST</b> out into America.</span>
<br/></p>
<ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Can <span>we really change the country?The
initial</span>challenge is to get the message of this book
into the national conversation in time so that it will have a chance to have a
meaningful and beneficial impact on the political climate in which the 2016
elections are held. The challenge might also be stated as to help give America
the “Emperor’s New Clothes” moment it so badly needs: to get enough people to
see the naked truth that the unprecedented is no longer treated as normal, and
the disgraceful is no longer treated as acceptable.</p>
<p>But the first challenge is to enlist the help of enough good
people who see what’s happening to America, and care enough to help. Help,
first, in getting the resources required to spread the word about WHAT WE’RE UP
AGAINST. And help, second, in build<span>ing a
movement to use this book and its message as a weapon in the political battle on
which America’s destiny depends.</span></p>

Fortunately,
we already have a team of a dozen or so people who believe in this effort
deeply enough to contribute their energy and creativity for nothing<span>.
Can we succeed in our online marketing
strategies to find and reach more liberal Americans who will join
forces with us? I believe we can.<span>  </span>And to help us meet that
challenge, I am asking for your financial help. </span>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>
We also need people to involve themselves in this nascent “movement.” Here
are a few of the ways you can help: Sending emails to like-minded people in
your network to encourage them to check the book out; participating in
discussions of strategy; reaching out to contacts in the worlds of politics and
communications; handing out brochures for the book at Bernie Sanders rallies;
and coming up with your own ways of spreading the word to awaken a deeper and
healthier understanding of WHAT WE’RE UP AGAINST and what we need to do to
overcome it.

Can a book do much to restore health to the American political
system? 
Such things do not happen often, but it is because I see a real

Do you sense the profundity of America’s present national crisis?
WHAT WE’RE UP AGAINST tackles this crisis head on, and shows how we

My goal for WHAT WE’RE UP AGAINST – improbable, but quite
plausible enough to warrant an all-out effort – is to get the message of this
book into the national conversation in time to influence the 2016 election
process. That requires that the book reach its target audience quickly. 
It is the need for speed that induced me, after more than thirty
years of being published by reputable commercial houses and university presses,
to self-publish WHAT WE’RE UP AGAINST. But self-publishing means we have to
create, on our own, the marketing muscle that a big publishing house would have
provided. Add to that the ambition for this book – to catalyze a political
movement – and the need becomes that much bigger.
Accomplishing this requires spreading the word.  And spreading the word takes money, and it
takes people pitching in with their energy and their creativity.
So we need your financial help. And as a sign of appreciation
for such a contribution, you will receive an advance copy of WHAT WE’RE UP
AGAINST. (Larger contributions get larger rewards, as described in the
“Perks” section.) 
And we need capable people to lend a hand. 
The more help we get, the better our chance of helping turn around
the toxic political dynamic of our times.
  The Impact

There’s a battle going on in America over the
destiny of our nation. It is a battle that must be fought and must be won. In
terms of impact on this battle, there’s a good chance that there’s no place you
can get more bang for your buck than in supporting the effort to get
WHAT WE’RE UP AGAINST out into America.

   Risks & Challenges
Can we really change the country?The
initialchallenge is to get the message of this book
into the national conversation in time so that it will have a chance to have a
meaningful and beneficial impact on the political climate in which the 2016
elections are held. The challenge might also be stated as to help give America
the “Emperor’s New Clothes” moment it so badly needs: to get enough people to
see the naked truth that the unprecedented is no longer treated as normal, and
the disgraceful is no longer treated as acceptable.
But the first challenge is to enlist the help of enough good
people who see what’s happening to America, and care enough to help. Help,
first, in getting the resources required to spread the word about WHAT WE’RE UP
AGAINST. And help, second, in building a
movement to use this book and its message as a weapon in the political battle on
which America’s destiny depends.

Fortunately,
we already have a team of a dozen or so people who believe in this effort
deeply enough to contribute their energy and creativity for nothing.
Can we succeed in our online marketing
strategies to find and reach more liberal Americans who will join
forces with us? I believe we can.  And to help us meet that
challenge, I am asking for your financial help. 

  Other Ways You Can Help 
We also need people to involve themselves in this nascent “movement.” Here
are a few of the ways you can help: Sending emails to like-minded people in
your network to encourage them to check the book out; participating in
discussions of strategy; reaching out to contacts in the worlds of politics and
communications; handing out brochures for the book at Bernie Sanders rallies;
and coming up with your own ways of spreading the word to awaken a deeper and
healthier understanding of WHAT WE’RE UP AGAINST and what we need to do to
overcome it.
  Help get the word out and make some noise about this endeavor!

<h3>Mentoring Women: We Need More!</h3>
<p>Hi!  Thanks for stopping by our profile.  We are Dr. David Borst - retired dean of a college of business, and Dr. Erin Albert - former associate professor of pharmacy practice. We share a passion for mentoring--specifically mentoring women.  We also realize there is a crisis of leadership in the US right now, and not enough women are at the helm in leadership positions in most industries.</p>
<p>Through this '2 books in one' project, we're going to share our own (different) perspectives on mentoring women, through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing our own mentoring experiences.</li>
<li>Sharing our own experiences on setting up mentoring programs.</li>
<li>Describing how to be a good mentor, and mentee.</li>
<li>Our approach and philosophy to mentoring, anti-mentoring, and sponsorship.</li>
<li>Helping you and others set up formal mentoring programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>While there are plenty of books on mentoring, there are few that address ""how to"" set up a mentoring program, both with the lens of the man and woman--for women, specifically.  We're here to help get more women at the helm through this project!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You'll Get if You Say Yes to Mentoring Women with this Project:</h3>
<p>We need the money for a first print run in order to publish this book in print format.  While we understand ebooks are easier and cheaper to produce, we also love good old fashioned paper books so we can utilize them as guides--and frankly, women need mentors over time, not just at one point in their lives!</p>
<p>We are selling individual copies at this site for presale, of course.  But, we're also selling an opportunity to have us help you start your own corporate mentoring program through our help!  There are a range of levels by which you can support this project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Straight up, Erin's in this to win this.  She wants to see more women at the helm in her fields (law, healthcare, entrepreneurship, and media).  David is in this to help women achieve their leadership goals, through his own experience.  Also, David's here to show other senior-level men that mentoring women is something they MUST do in this era in order to keep companies and our country globally competitive.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is no downside here.  We WILL publish this book, regardless of our results on this campaign.  But, with your support, we'll have this book-book in the hands of women who need it faster!</p>

in church one day just how talented she was. I would often see her taking notes
during the sermons, so I didn't think anything about it one way or another, but
one day I noticed that she didn’t have any scriptures written next to her notes
and that all her notes were going down just one side of the paper as opposed to
across the page as she usually did them, so I looked to see what she was
writing. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Later, after the service was over, I asked her what she had
been writing and she showed me not only that sheet of paper, but others like it
as well. She had been writing poems according to the messages the pastor had
been giving in his sermons. She had a whole collection of them that she had
done. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The one that I saw that I have chosen to use as the book’s

<p class=""MsoNormal"">My mother tried getting her collection published several

Operation Gratitude and I began to send cards and letters as well as other
items to them for their care packages for our troops overseas. Later on, I also
found a page for Green Beans Coffee Company and their Cup of Joe for a Joe
program as well and began sending coffee to our service members. All of this
was to show support for our troops and to help put a smile on their face for a

<p class=""MsoNormal"">I have heard back from quite a few of the recipients of the

<p class=""MsoNormal"">These two programs are not just about cards and letters or a

If you know Austin well enough, you know that he's pretty notorious for having issues with technology, but him putting up with this is seriously not cute anymore. Really, this? http://instagram.com/p/f4LVF6sKB6/# UNACCEPTABLE. New computers are expensive, pretty much unattainable on a TA's salary, but something that's really achievable if we all pull together and give a little bit. We want Austin to be able to continue working/writing/being hilarious and insightful on gaming streams, don't we? Let's help him out so he can! Need some reminding that Austin's a great guy who deserves this and makes great stuff? Oh man. Check  out his writing on Clockwork Worlds or hear him as a regular on Phil Kollar's stream channel.If you can't contribute--that's totally cool, no pressure! But help us out by spreading this link around, checking out some of Austin's work, shoot him a tweet to cheer him up! This is just as much about giving Austin an e-hug as it is helping him out with something he needs.Oh, also, some transparency: I'm the one putting this IndieGoGo together for Austin but the paypal/bank stuff is connected to him and is going straight to him with no need for transferring or concern he isn't getting every dime. I just wanna help a dude out, really! To give credit where it's due this idea stemmed from me(@ali_west) and Sarah (@newtypelady) and came together fully with some workshopping and help from Janine (@bleatingheart) and Phil (@pkollar). We're the ones who threw this together but now we need you help to make it happen!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>I Am Glass</i> is a poetry book that explores what it means to be “human”. From romance to loneliness to questioning, these poems take the reader through the many facets of the human experience and emotions. <br/><br/>My name is Julia Weidman and I am the author of <i>I Am Glass</i>. I wrote this book because I feel that we, as humans, often repress our emotions instead of pushing ourselves to be vulnerable. This book is my push. This book is glass. It’s fragile and vulnerable, and I’ve put my personal emotions and experiences into writing and conversation. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will feel connected to one of the words, poems, or emotions on its pages. Each poem is an opportunity to self-reflect on your own story and your own perspective, and I hope to inspire you as the reader to share and be open with the people in your life.<br/><br/>In this book, you’ll join in me using language to render distinct aspects of love, expectations, darkness, and bliss through poems like: </p>
<ul>
<li>“Drifting, Wandering, Waiting,” which explores the solitude and beauty of growing up in the Sonoran Desert.</li>
<li>“How Much,” which explores how we try to mold ourselves to fulfill others’ expectations. </li>
<li>“Little Specks of Fire,” which explores the moments of energy and connection that make us feel the most alive.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will enjoy this book if you love honest, raw conversations, if you appreciate moments that foster human connection, or if you are drawn to poetry. <br/><br/><i>I Am Glass</i> is for anyone looking to stop the cycle of repressing emotions and for those who have broken it and need to continue developing their life-long practice of sharing, expressing, and being vulnerable. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book Structure</h3>
<p><i>I Am Glass</i> is written in 6 Parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wine Glass explores the themes of love, romance, and relationships.</li>
<li>Glass Mirror explores the themes of self-reflection, introspection, and appearances.</li>
<li>Glass Shards explores the themes of regret, darkness, and loneliness.</li>
<li>Glass Ceiling explores the themes of self-empowerment, boldness, breaking boundaries and expectations.</li>
<li>Hourglass explores the themes of time, pressure, questioning, and mortality.</li>
<li>Crystal Glass explores the themes of the best and brightest moments of life.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to make help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this winter.</li>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Julia Weidman is a Duke University graduate and Investment Banking Analyst at Lazard. She is an avid dancer, hot sauce fanatic, and dedicated board game enthusiast. <br/><br/>She believes that we all strive for connection and compassion, but we can get in our way of achieving both by being closed off. She thinks that when we open up about our challenges and our brightest “crystal glass” moments, we recognize our shared experiences in the ups and down of life. The unity, power, and love that this connection fosters is what motivated her to write this book. <br/><br/>She used to be close-minded in her belief that over-analyzing her mental and emotional state was harmful, and that exploring and dwelling on feelings were distractions that would prevent her from achieving her goals in life. But Julia has found that self-reflection, honesty, and vulnerability have allowed her to build an even greater sense of self and access deeper meaning in all of her relationships than she ever imagined possible. <br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Julia at juliasweidman@gmail.com and on Facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn.<br/> </p>

<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.<br/> </p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>In Fall 2008 some friends and I made a bet to visit 100 bars in 100 days. It was made partly out of boredom and bravado, but despite the unavoidable inebriation and schenanigans, something pretty cool happened. I<em> really discovered</em> Seattle. I went all over the city, met a gaggle of new friends and created some amazing (albeit hazy) memories in the process. I decided to keep going past 100 days, and visit every bar in Seattle.</p>
<p>Around 2010 I started to get a reputation as a bar guide, and several friends began asking me to write a book for them about the Seattle bar scene. When several requests became dozens, I casually started a Kickstarter to see if people would actually fund such a project. To my surprise, it was!</p>
<p>Since writing that first book, I've listened to people's reviews, created a new website, and started work on larger, more in depth version that was updated with current information to be released by Black Friday, 2013!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Your Moolah Gets You</h3>
<p>All money raised will be used in the design and publication of the book- basically, the more I raise, the cheaper my bulk order will be! Plus the book is adding 50 new bars, an increase of 50%!</p>
<p>$12 Gets you an autorgraphed copy of the book, and a digital copy for your phone or comp!</p>
<p>$24 Gets you two autographed copies, one for yourself and one to give away, just in time for Xmas, 2013! Plus the digital copy.</p>
<p>$35 Gets you the two autographed copies, and a DRENCHED beer coozie! Plus the digital copy.</p>
<p>$50 Gets you all the swag, plus a published interview in the book!</p>
<p>$100 Gets you all the swag, plus a batch of home made cookies every month for six months! Or a lot of free babysitting.</p>
<p>$200 Gets you everything listed above, plus I'll let you write my author biography!</p>
<p>And of course everyone who donates will be in the THANK YOU section of the book!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Thanks For Reading!</h3>
<p>Creating and writing for DRENCHED has been a true pleasure I love that I am slowly making a living off of writing. People like you are helping make my dream come true- as small and drunken as it is. </p>
<p>That being said, this is the last time I will be crowd funding a DRENCHED book. My goal is to picked up by a larger publisher in 2014! So thank you for helping make a quality book for everyone in the Emerald City to enjoy!</p>

<h3>How <i>Tyler and Truffles' Big Flying Adventure</i> Came to Be</h3>
<p>Several years ago, my friends Tom and Christy welcomed their second baby boy into the world. Then one night, after oozing over the most recent pictures of Tyler and his constant companion, Truffles the Elephant, I decided to try my hand at writing a children's story featuring the adorable duo. By 3:00 a.m. the next morning, <i>Tyler and Truffle's Big Flying Adventure</i> was born.</p>
<p>After sharing the story with several moms who loved reading it to their kiddos, I decided to hire the amazing Emily Jay to illustrate the story and self-publish through Blurb. </p>
<p>Due to the high cost of printing full-color hardback books, hosting a pre-order sale is the only way I can get Tyler and Truffles' story into the world at a semi-reasonable price. I hope you love it enough to join me in making this book come alive in the hands and minds of children this Christmas. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The purchase price is $25 per book plus $5 shipping. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>One hardback, full-color copy of <i>Tyler and Truffle's Big Flying Adventure</i> signed by the author</li>
<li>Packaging, postage, and Indiegogo fee coverage</li>
<li>Delivery by Christmas Eve or before (Lord willing and without some unforeseen crisis)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone interested in purchasing a copy of the book after the campaign ends will be able to do so through Blurb's Print on Demand Feature, but the price is likely to increase.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Full disclosure...$3000 is roughly the expense of printing 100 books, having them shipped to my home in Michigan, and sending them to your doorstep. </p>
<p>If more than 100 books are ordered, the production cost might decrease. However, the price of purchasing a book through this campaign will remain the same. Any funds over and above printing and shipping costs will offset the expense of paying an illustrator.</p>

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>The year 2020 has exposed broadening inequalities in the land of hope, opportunity, and prosperity. Amid the U.S. economy’s gradual recovery from the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, software engineers in Silicon Valley and white collar workers in urban centers had seen a large expansion in their disposable income. But in the rural and suburban American heartland, farmers and blue collar workers have witnessed the devastating consequences of globalization. Then came a global pandemic and recession that have shuttered small businesses and prompted mass layoffs, crippling millions of formerly middle class U.S. households with unemployment and food insecurity. Meanwhile, inequality and discrimination based on race, gender, and sexual orientation remain far from being resolved.<br/><br/>While America struggles to find its footing, China is poised to emerge as a land of hope, opportunity, and prosperity. If you think of China as a poor, secluded country plagued by famine and political fanaticism, you haven't been paying attention. China’s economy is growing at a remarkable pace. The country's unprecedented growth has fostered a sense of national pride and a belief of the promise of social mobility and prosperity. And yet, even in prosperous times, China's urban-rural economic divide remains stark. While entrepreneurs in Beijing and Shanghai make their way onto the Forbes list, farmers in the countryside barely make it on less than $150 a month. <br/><br/>I’m <strong>Harry He</strong>, author of <i><strong>Marching Toward Moderate Prosperity</strong></i>. As a Chinese international student at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, I hear my classmates debate whether the American Dream is still possible. That is, the belief that any American, regardless of where they were born or what race or class they were born into, has an equal opportunity to achieve success through hard work, dedication, and passion. Americans haven’t cornered the market on dreaming. <br/><br/>Among China’s middle class, the Chinese Dream is very much alive. This promise of individual success and achievements combines the ancient wisdom that “education changes destiny,” the bright projection of long-term high-speed economic growth, and the government’s promise that China is marching toward a prosperous society. <br/><br/><strong><i>Marching Toward Moderate Prosperity</i></strong> is a tale of China’s miraculous economic development, told through the accounts of members of China’s middle class. In reading this book, you will discover that the story of an economically prosperous China isn’t every Chinese citizen’s story and that the promise of the Chinese Dream is not so easily accessible for many. I hope to inspire and excite you with stories of Chinese citizens grappling with the idea of economic development and the Chinese Dream, such as<ul>
<li>Disillusioned by the promise that education changes destiny, a young college graduate abandons his dream and settles down for a complacent career.</li>
<li>Determined to provide a better education and opportunities for his daughters, an ambitious civil servant and dedicated father struggles to climb the social ladder.</li>
<li>Under traditional, familial, and social pressure, a young and capable women decides to prioritize family over her career. </li>
</ul>These three protagonists are examples of what a successful story for a Chinese middle class should look like, but if you follow my story and delve deeper into their narratives, you will identify sources of dissatisfaction, discontent, and disillusionment that does not fit the overall theme of achieving the Chinese dream and marching toward prosperity.<br/><br/><i><strong>Marching Toward Moderate Prosperity</strong></i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to any who want to look at China and economic development in a new way. You will love this book if you are passionate about a fresh account of China, interested to learn about a different perspective of a story about development, or simply curious about personal stories from the other side of the Pacific.<br/> <h3><strong>The Book - <i>Marching Toward Moderate Prosperity</i></strong></h3>
<p><strong>The book is written in five parts.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapters 1-2. It sets the stage for the stories by unpeeling the concept of the Chinese dream and familiarizing you with the characters you will meet throughout the rest of the book<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 3-5. Through the lens of class, these chapters dissect economic and social stratification in China. You will gain a better sense where the subjects of this book stand within the Chinese society to better understand their fears, hopes, and dreams that can resonate with your own personal experience. <br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 6-7. Building upon the previous discussion on class, these chapters expose you to the flip side of the same coin. In a sharp turn, advantages become disadvantages and privileges become shackles. <br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> contains chapters 8-10. Gender-related issues predominate these chapters. You will be invited to identify the promise of greater gender equality in the narrative of the Chinese dream as we explore why women have experienced China’s economic boom significantly differently from their male counterparts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 5</strong> contains chapters 11-12. Building toward the conclusion, we’ll weave together the book’s personal stories into a broader framework of economic and social development. A paradox exists between the perception that the Chinese Dream is universally attainable and the reality that it remains elusive and unreachable to many within society. We’ll seek to resolve this paradox together. </p>

This book tells the story of human solitude and creative endeavor throughout history and around the globe. Ultimately I want this book to serve as a toolkit for connecting with and structuring a healthy inner life.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll see how others have dealt with solitude, loneliness, and isolation and turned it into a force for creative thought and action. It also includes:<ul>
<li>Methodologies to rediscover your interests and passions</li>
<li>Techniques to set and achieve personal goals</li>
<li>Practices to become more mindful, present, and driven</li>
</ul>If you have a pile of unfinished projects or incomplete goals, this book will show you how to refocus on yourself and get back to them, and how doing so will benefit both you and the people in your life.<br/><br/><i>The Lonesome Thread</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to people who desire to be more connected with themselves, particularly in times of loneliness and solitude. This is a great book for anyone looking to breathe some life into their social-distancing routines and use their time more creatively.<br/> <h3>About The Book</h3>

<li>
<i>Creation and Gratitude</i> contains inspiring stories of people who use their time unplugged from society as a means to recharge and reenergize themselves to be better stewards of the human race.

The Lonesome Thread: Reflections of Solitude, Boredom, & Creativity is a book about developing a positive and creative relationship with solitude and boredom.My name is Bryan Crosson and I am the author of The Lonesome Thread: Reflections of Solitude, Boredom, & Creativity. I wrote this book because I wanted to show people how building a healthy inner-life can enhance their relationship with themselves and others.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover new perspectives on time spent alone and the potential it has to be a force for good. This book tells the story of human solitude and creative endeavor throughout history and around the globe. Ultimately I want this book to serve as a toolkit for connecting with and structuring a healthy inner life.In this book, you'll see how others have dealt with solitude, loneliness, and isolation and turned it into a force for creative thought and action. It also includes:
Methodologies to rediscover your interests and passions
Techniques to set and achieve personal goals
Practices to become more mindful, present, and driven
If you have a pile of unfinished projects or incomplete goals, this book will show you how to refocus on yourself and get back to them, and how doing so will benefit both you and the people in your life.The Lonesome Thread is a non-fiction book that speaks to people who desire to be more connected with themselves, particularly in times of loneliness and solitude. This is a great book for anyone looking to breathe some life into their social-distancing routines and use their time more creatively. About The Book
The Lonesome Thread is written in 3 Parts:


Time and Space contains stories about leaders, entrepreneurs, and warriors who have withdrawn from society, walked the world alone, and successfully returned transformed.

Tools and Reflections includes personal anecdotes that provide tactics and techniques to shape your mindset and rediscover your personal interests and goals. From jumping out of planes over rural Virginia to chasing knife-wielding thieves through the streets of Thailand, this section explains the tools I have found useful throughout my life.

Creation and Gratitude contains inspiring stories of people who use their time unplugged from society as a means to recharge and reenergize themselves to be better stewards of the human race. This section shows how by focusing on the things that are personally fulfilling to us we can give back in greater measures to those around us.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Kyra Ann Dawkins. I was compelled to write <i>The We and the They</i> because I wanted to create a narrative space where one could healthily escape the limits of individuality and experience a story as a member of a new collective.<br/><br/><i>The We and the They</i> is set in a world crumbling underneath the grip of the Great Famine. There are people who are wandering throughout the wilderness, who ultimately coalesce and meet each other and agree to look out for one another as they find food. This group ultimately ends up calling themselves the We.<br/><br/>As the We are moving through the desert, they encounter a group of people called the They who invite the We to their big farm oasis amidst the wilderness, promising to feed them. The We willingly go with the They and the They do, in fact, feed the We. However, it soon becomes clear that the They intend to abuse the We in different and more insidious ways. Even as the We are eating these elaborate feasts on a beautiful dining table, their legs are tied to the chairs and they are not released until every morsel on their plates is consumed.<br/><br/>Though the “We” perspective is maintained throughout the entire book, readers will have the opportunity to meet six named We characters. All six of them die from things they swallow while the We are still with the They. As the We wrestle with grief and honor their lost ones' memory, they discover that the They invited them to the big farm for an even darker purpose. With all of this in mind, the We decide whether or not they need to escape.<br/><br/>I hope that <i>The We and the They</i> is the kind of book that people will want to read aloud and discuss with one another. This book explores the intersections of collectivity, loss, and different definitions of satisfaction. Throughout the plot, this book engages with questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does a community maintain unity in the midst of scarcity?</li>
<li>What does it mean to navigate grief and honor the memories of those who pass away?</li>
<li>How does the framing of satisfaction change the ways in which people go about attaining it?</li>
</ul>
<p>You will enjoy this book if you are fascinated by oral tradition, you like considering questions about community and identity, or you just want a break from curating your “I.”</p>
<p>I want The We and the They to foster communal discussions about identity, grief, and legacy. It has always amazed me how much a narrative can bring people together, and I look forward to becoming closer to all of you, my incredible readers, through this story.<br/> </p>

<h3>Secondary Goal: Angular, React, or Vue?</h3>
<p>In 11 days the campaign goal was reached. Thank you for your support!  I've already started to write the <a href=""https://leanpub.com/dancer-spa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Perl Dancer SPA book</a> and I am going to send out the perks in the coming days.</p>
<p>However let's not stop here. Let's get even more support for the book and add <strong>more value</strong> to the book. Several people suggested to use <a href=""https://angular.io/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Angular</a>, <a href=""https://facebook.github.io/react/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">React</a>, or <a href=""https://vuejs.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vue</a> instead of jQuery. So here is the deal I offer. If we reach <strong>$7000</strong> I'll implement the whole front-end part in one of those frameworks as well. In addition to jQuery. Which one? The people who support the book will decide. I'll ask everyone who supported the campaign which one they prefer and the one with the most votes will win.</p> <h3>About the Dancer eBook</h3>
<p>Many modern web applications are Single Page Applications (SPA).  They load only one HTML page and from that point on they communicate with the server using AJAX requests.</p>
<p>The most well known example of a SPA is Gmail, but a lot of modern web applications work this way.</p>
<p>Perl Dancer 2 is a modern, light-weight, route-based web framework for Perl 5.</p>
<p>jQuery is the workhorse of the front-end, a JavaScript library that seems to stick around as other libraries come and go.</p>
<p>Bootstrap is probably the most popular HTML/CSS framework for creating web applications.</p>
<p>SPAs are well suited for applications that require authentication and thus don't expect to be indexed by search engines. While the focus of this book is SPAs, a web site can include both a private web application and a set of public pages that need to be indexed by search engines.</p>
<p>This e-book will include a chapter on creating content-heavy public pages that can be used for SEO (Search Engine Optimization).</p>
<p>You will not be required to have an expert knowledge of Perl, but knowing Perl will certainly be to your advantage. For example, you are not expected to know how to install modules. It will be explained.</p>
<p>The eBook will be self-published via Leanpub. You'll get 3 files in pdf, epub, and mobi formats.</p>
<p>The planned release date of the final e-book is February 2018.</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need at least $20,000 to cover the time I am going to spend on the book. I hope that once the book is published I'll be able to sell many copies of it and will be able to get that covered. I might even earn some extra. However, I don't want to write a book and find out that no one is really interested. So, I am running this crowdfunding campaign to gauge the interest in this book.</p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to raise $4,000.</p>
<p>This is an ""all-or-nothing"" campaign. If we don't reach the goal, all the contributions will be refunded and the project will be cancelled.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I could get run over by a bus or otherwise become unable to do the physical or mental work needed for this e-book. This does not seem very likely to me. Other than that, I don't see any major risk.</p>
<p>I've been teaching this subject for several years now. I ""just"" need to convert it into a book.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Getting your direct support is golden, but you can do so much more to help the campaign! You could get a personalized link from  Indiegogo and recommend the campaign to your co-workers, Twitter followers, Facebook friends, etc. Each such share will also compel Indiegogo to further promote the campaign. Unlike in programming where DRY is a considered a desirable value, if you want people to do something you usually have to get them exposed to the idea several times. So don't be DRY.

Many modern web applications are Single Page Applications (SPA).  They load only one HTML page and from that point on they communicate with the server using AJAX requests.
The most well known example of a SPA is Gmail, but a lot of modern web applications work this way.
Perl Dancer 2 is a modern, light-weight, route-based web framework for Perl 5.
jQuery is the workhorse of the front-end, a JavaScript library that seems to stick around as other libraries come and go.
Bootstrap is probably the most popular HTML/CSS framework for creating web applications.
SPAs are well suited for applications that require authentication and thus don't expect to be indexed by search engines. While the focus of this book is SPAs, a web site can include both a private web application and a set of public pages that need to be indexed by search engines.

<p>Welcome to my campaign. I'm a candidate for a Master of Fine Arts in Writing. I've worked towards this goal for almost 30 years in one way or another. I also work full-time as a Legal Document Specialist for Document Technologies, Inc., and I'm an avid ukulele player. My biggest claim to fame is that I managed to raise four kids who turned into decent adults whom I enjoy hanging out with, discovering that I learned more from them about life than they did from me. I grew up in San Francisco and currently reside in Keizer, Oregon. I write stories about growing up in San Francisco in the 1960's and '70's, and about my chaotic life as a single mom who survived. </p>
<p>My campaign is to raise money to finish my MFA Program and to assist in publishing my book entitled, ""How Will I Explain This To My Kids?"" Finishing my thesis (my book) and receiving the MFA I've worked so hard for these past three years means everything to me as well as my family.</p>
<p>A year ago, I found out that I ran out of financial aid options for the graduate program, but I did not let that stop me. I have been paying tuition on my own for the program. I continue to work full-time, however, I just do not have enough funds to pay for the rest of my tuition. </p>
<p>Asking for help is not easy for me, and this is a last-ditch attempt to succeed, not only in finishing the MFA program (which I'm still working towards diligently), but also to publish my book, ""How Do I Explain This To My Kids."" The book is not just about a stressed out single mom who raises four kids, but about how we made the best of potentially bad situations and how we fell between the cracks, which many people do today. The book is a unique view on the world and how to survive in spite of many obstacles.</p>
<p>I want to show my kids that it is never too late to achieve your goals. Because of this, I'm wiling to do whatever it takes to make this happen. I will finally be able to say I finished the program as well as my thesis (my book).</p>
</div><div>
<p>As a part-time student in the MFA Program, I took two classes a semester. Each class costs $2,100 ($700 per credit, which is average for any accredited graduate program). I only need $1,560 to raech my goal!</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>The MFA in Writing has helped me build a career as a published author. I know it takes hard work and perseverance, and I'm ready for that. My goal is to eventually transition from my current day job into writing full-time for a living.</span></p>
<p>If I don't reach my financial goal, I will put all funds towards my tuition and continue paying for the balance due on my own as best I can. Right now, I'm working on my thesis while holding down a full-time job. If I could work a second job, I would, however, that is not possible right now.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Knowledge is power and no one can take that away from you. It's an experience of a lifetime. My belief is that all people deserve the opportunity of education. In today's world, it's more difficult than ever for students and their parents to pay for a good education. Luckily, community colleges still offer lower cost options, but four-year colleges and graduate programs are so expensive that it's almost an unreachable goal for people. </p>
<p>Although financial aid is available for graduate programs, one can only go so far with student loans without going into deep debt. Good writers who help people cope with life are needed more than ever. The best thing we can do is help each other. </p>
<p>Those of you who assist in making my dream come true will receive an autographed copy of my book, ""How Do I Explain This To My Kids"" and my gratitude. I also promise to ""pay it forward.""</p>

<b>Who
I am</b><br/>To talk about himself is always difficult, but I think
that the things to know about a photographer are quite a few ... The
best way to know a photographer is ... look at his photos.<br/>Born in
1981, I am passionate about photography since the age of 5 years when
I started taking my first photos with my mothers’s old Agfa
Agfamatic 126 of 1969.<br/>At 13 years I bought my first SLR camera, a
Yashica 108 MP, which I used until 2003, when I moved to digital out
of curiosity, convenience and significant cost savings.<br/>The
picture usually is and will remain my greatest passion, but what I
prefer the most are the travel report and in particular the
portraits.<br/>When I visit a place with my trusted cameras atm y
neck, I look at everything with different eyes, they are more
attentive and critical ... I'm looking for ""the shot"". I'm
like a child who sees for the first time an object or a place, and
with the simplicity and ingenuity that characterizes a child I want
to know everything and every nuance around him.<br/>July 2, 2012 I
inaugurated my first photo exhibition entitled ""Nepal Life""
at Circolo Eridano in Turin.</p>
<p>
<span>On
October 2013 I inaugurated my second photographic exhibition ,
« Berlin Calling », always at the Circolo Eridano of
Turin.</span></p>
<p>
<span>On
September 2014 I published my first photographic book “Emotions
from Ethiopia”. It's a book containing more than 400 photographs
done during my travel in Ethiopia between February and March 2014.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b><span>My
project</span></b></p>
<p>
Between
February and March I travelled three weeks all around Ethiopia. In
this way I could discover and appreciate this fantastic country that
gave me more than 6000 photographs. From them 
</p>
<p>
<span>I
chose the best to publish my first book called “Emotions from
Ethiopia”.</span></p>
<p>
<span>After
turning the pages of my book that has been just printed I desired to
be involved in a new adventure. This time in a much more specific
project: to go to Eritrea for a photographic
service about the only railway of the country between Asmara and
Massaua. On my return I will publish a book.</span></p>
<p>
<span>I'll
take a series of shots in order to describe in the best way this
train that cross very beautiful and charming places. I'll take this
train to testify the trip of the inhabitants of these lands. I'll go
in search of portraits and people “in situation”  (the
photographs I like the best). </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>I
became convinced to come again into the play with a new project when
I met my idol concerning photographs: Steve McCurry. He examined my
book, he found it interesting and well done and he wrote a dedication
to me on the first page (as you can see in the photo).</span></p><p><span></span></p><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1138850/files/20150108154915-simone_e_steve_mccurry_2.jpg?1420760955"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span><span>In
the photo appear Steve McCurry, my book “Emotions from Ethiopia”
and I.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>How
do I intend to use the amount?</b></p>
<p>
<span>I'll
use the amount to cover the travel expenses (flight ticket, local
guide, car rent, hotel, etc.). I'll cover also the expenses for the
realization and printing of the copies I'll give to people who bought
10 q</span><span>uotas</span><span>,
photograph print and shipment of all objects to people who
contributed to the realization of my project.</span></p>

<b>Chi
sono</b><br/>Parlare
di se stessi è sempre difficile, ma credo che le cose da sapere di
un fotografo siano ben poche… Il miglior modo di conoscere un
fotografo è… guardare le sue fotografie.<br/>Classe
1981, sono appassionato di fotografia dall’età di 5 anni quando ho
iniziato a scattare le mie prime fotografie con una vecchia Agfa
Agfamatic 126 del 1969 di mia madre.<br/>A
13 anni ho acquistato la mia prima reflex, una Yashica 108 MP, che ho
utilizzato fino al 2003, quando sono approdato al digitale per
curiosità, comodità e notevole risparmio economico.<br/>La
fotografia in genere è e rimarrà la mia più grande passione, ma la
cosa che più preferisco sono i reportage di viaggio ed in
particolare i ritratti.<br/>Quando
visito un posto con al collo una delle mie fidate macchine
fotografiche guardo tutto con occhi diversi, sono più attento e
critico… Sono in cerca “dello scatto”. Sono come un bambino che
vede per la prima volta un oggetto o un luogo e con la semplicità e
l’ingenuità che contraddistingue un bambino voglio scoprire tutto
e ogni sfumatura di questo tutto.<br/>Il
2 luglio 2012 ho inaugurato la mia prima mostra fotografica dal
titolo “Nepal Life” presso il Circolo Eridano di Torino.</p>
<p>
Ad
ottobre 2013 ho inaugurato la mia seconda mostra fotografica dal
titolo “Berlin Calling” sempre presso il Circolo Eridano di
Torino. 
</p>
<p>
A
settembre 2014 ho pubblicato il mio primo libro fotografico dal
titolo “Emotions from Ethiopia”. È un libro che contiene più di
400 fotografie che ho scattato in occasione del mio viaggio in
Etiopia tra febbraio e marzo 2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>Il
progetto</b><br/>Tra
febbraio e marzo 2014 sono stato 3 settimane in Etiopia ed ho potuto
scoprire ed assaporare questo paese fantastico che mi ha regalato più
di 6000 fotografie dalle quali ho cercato di estrarre le migliori per
pubblicare il mio primo libro dal titolo “Emotions from Ethiopia”.</p>
<p>
Poco
dopo aver sfogliato il mio libro appena stampato mi è venuta voglia
di rimettermi di nuovo in gioco con una nuova avventura. Questa volta
con un progetto molto più specifico e cioè andare in Eritrea a fare
un servizio fotografico sull'unica linea ferroviaria del paese tra
Asmara e Massaua per poi pubblicare un libro al mio ritorno.</p>
<p>
Farò
una serie di scatti per cercare di descrivere al meglio questo treno
che attraversa zone molto belle ed affascinanti. Prenderò il treno
per testimoniare il viaggio dei locali e nella ricerca di ritratti e
figure ambientate (sono le mie foto preferite).</p>
<p>
La
spinta a rimettermi in gioco con un altro progetto è nata anche dopo
che ho avuto la fortuna di incontrare il mio idolo, fotograficamente
parlando, Steve McCurry. Il quale ha sfogliato il mio libro e mi ha
lasciato una bella dedica all'interno (come potete vedere dalla
foto). 
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1138851/files/20150108155002-simone_e_steve_mccurry_2.jpg?1420761002"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>
Nella
fotografia siamo io, McCurry ed il mio libro “Emotions from
Ethiopia”. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Per
cosa userò le quote?</b></p>
<p>
Le
quote mi serviranno per coprire le spese del viaggio e cioè
biglietto aereo, guida locale, affitto auto, hotel, ecc.</p>
<p>
<span>Con
le quote coprirò anche le spese di realizzazione e stampa delle
copie del libro da dare a chi ha comprato 10 quote, la stampa delle
fotografie e la spedizione di tutti gli oggetti a chi ha contribuito
alla realizzazione di questo mio progetto. </span>
</p>
<p>

<p>
Nel

progetto, tutti i soldi che raccoglierò oltre tale cifra li
devolverò ad un orfanotrofio che ho visitato quando ero in Etiopia.
Si tratta dell'OMO CHILD di Jinka. 
</p>
<p>
Questo
orfanotrofio è stato aperto da Lale Labuko. Ne parlano sul National
Geographic di dicembre 2013, ne parla Steve McCurry sul suo sito (

<p>
<span><span>Entre
février et mars 2014 j'ai été trois semaines en Ethiopie . En
cette occasion j'ai pu découvrir et savourer  ce pays fantastique
qui m'a fait cadeau de plus de 6000 photographies desquelles j'ai
essayé d'extraire les meilleures afin de publier mon premier livre
intitulé “Emotions from Ethiopia”.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Peu
après avoir feuilleté mon livre qui venait de sortir j'ai eu envie
de me remettre en jeu avec une nouvelle aventure. Cette fois avc un
projet  beaucoup plus spécifique à savoir aller en Erythrée pour
faire un reportage photographique  sur l'unique ligne de chemin de
fer du pays entre Asmara et Massaouah pour publier ensuite un livre à
mon retour.</span></span></p>
<p>
Je
compte faire une série de photos pour essayer de décrire le mieux
possible ce train qui traverse  des zones très belles et riches en
charme. Je prendrai ce train  pour témoigner du voyage  des
habitants de ces lieux . J'irai à la recherche  de portraits et de
personnes mises en situation (ce sont mes photos préférées).</p>
<p>
Ce
qui m'a poussé à me remettre en jeu  par un autre projet a été
mon heureuse rencontre avec mon photographe idole, Steve McCurry. Il
a examiné mon livre et à la fin il m'a fait une dédicace à
l'intérieur (comme on peut voir dans la photo).</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1138855/files/20150108155121-simone_e_steve_mccurry_2.jpg?1420761081"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span><span>Dans

I amTo talk about himself is always difficult, but I think
that the things to know about a photographer are quite a few ... The
best way to know a photographer is ... look at his photos.Born in
1981, I am passionate about photography since the age of 5 years when
I started taking my first photos with my mothers’s old Agfa
Agfamatic 126 of 1969.At 13 years I bought my first SLR camera, a
Yashica 108 MP, which I used until 2003, when I moved to digital out
of curiosity, convenience and significant cost savings.The
picture usually is and will remain my greatest passion, but what I
prefer the most are the travel report and in particular the
portraits.When I visit a place with my trusted cameras atm y
neck, I look at everything with different eyes, they are more
attentive and critical ... I'm looking for ""the shot"". I'm
like a child who sees for the first time an object or a place, and
with the simplicity and ingenuity that characterizes a child I want
to know everything and every nuance around him.July 2, 2012 I
inaugurated my first photo exhibition entitled ""Nepal Life""
at Circolo Eridano in Turin.

On
October 2013 I inaugurated my second photographic exhibition ,
« Berlin Calling », always at the Circolo Eridano of
Turin.

On
September 2014 I published my first photographic book “Emotions
from Ethiopia”. It's a book containing more than 400 photographs
done during my travel in Ethiopia between February and March 2014.


My
project

Between
February and March I travelled three weeks all around Ethiopia. In
this way I could discover and appreciate this fantastic country that
gave me more than 6000 photographs. From them 


I
chose the best to publish my first book called “Emotions from
Ethiopia”.

After
turning the pages of my book that has been just printed I desired to
be involved in a new adventure. This time in a much more specific
project: to go to Eritrea for a photographic
service about the only railway of the country between Asmara and
Massaua. On my return I will publish a book.

I'll
take a series of shots in order to describe in the best way this
train that cross very beautiful and charming places. I'll take this
train to testify the trip of the inhabitants of these lands. I'll go
in search of portraits and people “in situation”  (the
photographs I like the best). 


I
became convinced to come again into the play with a new project when
I met my idol concerning photographs: Steve McCurry. He examined my
book, he found it interesting and well done and he wrote a dedication
to me on the first page (as you can see in the photo).
In
the photo appear Steve McCurry, my book “Emotions from Ethiopia”
and I.



How
do I intend to use the amount?

I'll
use the amount to cover the travel expenses (flight ticket, local
guide, car rent, hotel, etc.). I'll cover also the expenses for the
realization and printing of the copies I'll give to people who bought
10 quotas,
photograph print and shipment of all objects to people who
contributed to the realization of my project.


1
quota  → A photograph of your choice sent by email.3
quotas  → A photo of your choice printed on 20x30 shipped to
your home address.5 quotas  → Three photos of your
choice printed on 20x30 shipped to your home address.7 quotas  → One
typical object brought from Eritrea and shipped to your home address.

10
quotas → the book shipped to your home address. 




If
I exceed the amount requested ?

If
I collect all the money necessary for my project, the surplus will be
devolved to un orphanage I visited when I was in Ethiopia: the OMO
CHILD of Jinka. This orphanage has been created by Lale Labuko. An
article concerning it appeared in National Geographic of December
2013. Steve McCurry too talk about this institution in his website (
http://stevemccurry.wordpress.com/2012/10/02/to-save-a-child-3/
).

For
further information this is their site:

http://omochild.org/My photo of children of Omo Child orphanage. Obviously
I'll send by mail the receipt of the donation to the Omo Child
orphanage to all people who contributed to my project.



If
the amount  isn't reached?

If
unfortunately the amount isn't reached, I can't leave for Eritrea and
do my photographic project, but people who trusted in me will be
rewarded in this way:


1
quota → A photograph of your choice sent by email.3
quotas → A photo of your choice printed on 20x30 shipped to
your home address.5 quotas  → Three photos of your
choice printed on 20x30 shipped to your home address.7 quotas  → Five photos of your choice printed on 20x30 shipped to
your home address.

10
quotas  → the book “Emotions from Ethiopia” shipped to
your home address.

dopo aver sfogliato il mio libro appena stampato mi è venuta voglia
di rimettermi di nuovo in gioco con una nuova avventura. Questa volta
con un progetto molto più specifico e cioè andare in Eritrea a fare
un servizio fotografico sull'unica linea ferroviaria del paese tra
Asmara e Massaua per poi pubblicare un libro al mio ritorno.

Farò
una serie di scatti per cercare di descrivere al meglio questo treno
che attraversa zone molto belle ed affascinanti. Prenderò il treno
per testimoniare il viaggio dei locali e nella ricerca di ritratti e
figure ambientate (sono le mie foto preferite).

La
spinta a rimettermi in gioco con un altro progetto è nata anche dopo
che ho avuto la fortuna di incontrare il mio idolo, fotograficamente
parlando, Steve McCurry. Il quale ha sfogliato il mio libro e mi ha
lasciato una bella dedica all'interno (come potete vedere dalla
foto). 


Nella
fotografia siamo io, McCurry ed il mio libro “Emotions from
Ethiopia”. 



Per
cosa userò le quote?

Le
quote mi serviranno per coprire le spese del viaggio e cioè
biglietto aereo, guida locale, affitto auto, hotel, ecc.

Con
le quote coprirò anche le spese di realizzazione e stampa delle
copie del libro da dare a chi ha comprato 10 quote, la stampa delle
fotografie e la spedizione di tutti gli oggetti a chi ha contribuito
alla realizzazione di questo mio progetto. 



Quote1
quota  → Una fotografia a scelta spedita via mail.3
quote → Una fotografia a scelta stampata in formato 20x30
spedita a casa5
quote → Tre fotografie a scelta stampate in formato 20x30 e
spedite a casa7
quote → Un manufatto tipico portato dall'Eritrea spedito a
casa

10
quote → Il libro spedito a casa



Se
viene superata la cifra richiesta?

Nel
caso in cui riesca a raccogliere i soldi necessari per il mio
progetto, tutti i soldi che raccoglierò oltre tale cifra li
devolverò ad un orfanotrofio che ho visitato quando ero in Etiopia.
Si tratta dell'OMO CHILD di Jinka. 


Questo
orfanotrofio è stato aperto da Lale Labuko. Ne parlano sul National
Geographic di dicembre 2013, ne parla Steve McCurry sul suo sito (
http://stevemccurry.wordpress.com/2012/10/02/to-save-a-child-3/
).

Per
maggiori informazioni questo è il loro sito:

Ovviamente
manderò via mail la ricevuta a tutte le persone che hanno
contribuito al mio progetto dell'avvenuta donazione all'Omo Child.


Se
non viene raggiunta la cifra richiesta?

Se
purtroppo la cifra da me richiesta non verrà raggiunta, non potrò
partire per l'Eritrea e fare il mio progetto fotografico, ma chi avrà
creduto ugualmente in me è giusto che sia ricompensato ed ho pensato
di farlo in questo modo:

Qui
suis-jeParler
de soi est toujours difficile, mais je pense que les choses qu’il
faut connaître au sujet d’un photographe sont très peu
nombreuses... La meilleure façon de connaître un photographe est
... regarder ses photos.Né en 1981, je suis passionné de
photographie depuis l'âge de 5 ans quand j'ai commencé à prendre
mes premières photos avec un vieux Agfa Agfamatic 126 de 1969 de ma
mère.À 13 ans, j'ai acheté mon premier appareil reflex, un
Yashica 108 MP, que j'ai utilisé jusqu'en 2003, quand j'ai opté
pour le numérique par curiosité, commodité et pour réaliser
d'importantes économies.La photo en général est et restera ma
plus grande passion, mais ce que je préfère sont les reportages de
voyage, en particulier les portraits.Lorsque je visite un endroit
avec l’une de mes caméras au cou je vois tout avec des yeux
différents, mon regard est plus attentif et critique… Je suis à
la recherche de la photo. Je suis comme un enfant qui voit pour la
première fois un objet ou un lieu, et avec la simplicité et la
naïveté qui le caractérise, je veux tout savoir et capter toutes
les nuances.Le 2 juillet 2012 j’ai inauguré ma première
exposition photo intitulée “Nepal Life” auprès du Circolo
Eridano de Turin.

En
octobre 2013 j'ai inauguré ma deuxième exposition de photos,
« Berlin Calling », toujours auprès du Circolo Eridano
de Turin.

En
septembre 2014 j'ai publié mon premier livre photographique,
“Emotions from Ethiopia”. Il s'agit d'un livre contenant plus de
400 photos que j'ai faites en occasion de mon voyage en Ethiopie
entre février et mars 2014.


Mon
projet

Entre
février et mars 2014 j'ai été trois semaines en Ethiopie . En
cette occasion j'ai pu découvrir et savourer  ce pays fantastique
qui m'a fait cadeau de plus de 6000 photographies desquelles j'ai
essayé d'extraire les meilleures afin de publier mon premier livre
intitulé “Emotions from Ethiopia”.

Peu
après avoir feuilleté mon livre qui venait de sortir j'ai eu envie
de me remettre en jeu avec une nouvelle aventure. Cette fois avc un
projet  beaucoup plus spécifique à savoir aller en Erythrée pour
faire un reportage photographique  sur l'unique ligne de chemin de
fer du pays entre Asmara et Massaouah pour publier ensuite un livre à
mon retour.

Je
compte faire une série de photos pour essayer de décrire le mieux
possible ce train qui traverse  des zones très belles et riches en
charme. Je prendrai ce train  pour témoigner du voyage  des
habitants de ces lieux . J'irai à la recherche  de portraits et de
personnes mises en situation (ce sont mes photos préférées).

Ce
qui m'a poussé à me remettre en jeu  par un autre projet a été
mon heureuse rencontre avec mon photographe idole, Steve McCurry. Il
a examiné mon livre et à la fin il m'a fait une dédicace à
l'intérieur (comme on peut voir dans la photo).Dans
la photo paraissent Steve McCurry, moi et mon livre “Emotions from
Ethiopia”.


Comment
utiliserai-je les cotisations?

Les
cotisations serviront à couvrir les frais  du voyage à savoir le
ticket d'avion, le guide local, l'hotel où je descendrai et tout ce
qui sera nécessaire.

Elles
serviront aussi à couvrir les frais de réalisation et d'impression
des copies du livre que recevront tous ceux qui ont acheté 10
quotes-parts, l'impression des photos et l'envoi de tous les objets à
ceux qui ont contribué à la réalisation de mon projet.



Quotas1
quota  → Une photographie de votre choix par courriel.3
quotas → Une photo de votre choix imprimée (format 20x30)
et envoyée chez vous par la poste.5 quotas → Trois
photos de votre choix imprimées (format 20x30) et envoyées chez
vous par la poste.7 quotas → Un objet typique emporté
d'Erythrée et envoyé à domicile.10
quotas→ Photobook envoyé chez vous par la poste.



Si
le chiffre demandé est dépassé?

Au
cas où je réussirais à recueillir tout l'argent nécessaire pour
mon projet, le surplus je le donnerai à un orphelinat que j'ai
visité pendant mon voyage en Ethiopie. Il s'agit de l'OMO CHILD de
Jinka. Il a été ouvert par Lale Labuko. On en parle dans un article
paru dans National Geographic de décembre 2013. Steve McCurry aussi
en parle dans son site
(http://stevemccurry.wordpress.com/2012/10/02/to-save-a-child-3/
).

Pour
avoir plus de renseignements aller au site:

http://omochild.org/Une de mes photos aux enfants de l'orphelinat Omo Child.


Naturellement
j'enverrai via mail le récépissé de la donation à Omo Child à
tous ceux qui ont contribué à mon projet.


Si
on n'atteint pas le chiffre que j'ai demandé?

Si
malheureusement le chiffre que j'ai demandé n'est pas atteint je ne
pourrai pas partir en Erythrée et achever mon projet photographique,
mais il est juste que qui a cru en moi soit recompensé. J'ai pensé
le faire en cette manière:

1
quote → Une photo au choix envoyée via mail

3
quotes → Une photo au choix imprimée format 20x30 envoyée à
domicile

5
quotes → Trois photos au choix imprimées format 20x30
envoyées à domicile

7
quotes → Cinq photos au choix imprimées format 20x30
envoyées à domicile

10
quotes → Livre “Emotions from Ethiopia” envoyé à
domicile.

</div>
<p>Mit navn er
Mads Aggerholm. Jeg er 47 år, og har arbejdet som programmør i de fleste af
dem.</p>
<p>Hele mit
liv har jeg læst masser af science-fiction (og også andre bøger) og i 26 år har
jeg haft ideen til en science-fiction historie til at ligge og ulme i hovedet.</p>
<p>Nu har jeg
endelig fået den skrevet. Og den er <i>god</i>, venner!</p>
<p>Så nu skal
den udgives!</p>
<p>Men
science-fiction er noget som forlagene helst ikke vil røre med en tres meter
lang ildtang – med mindre det er skrevet af gamle, velkonsoliderede forfattere.
Det selskab tilhører jeg endnu ikke...!</p>
<p>Men den tog
tid at skrive, og den skal altså trykkes!</p>
<p>Derfor vil
jeg prøve sådan et af de her selvudgiver-forlag, men da mine midler er
begrænsede forsøger jeg at rejse pengene ad den her vej. Det er belønninger til
bidragsyderne (nærmere herom på ’Select a Perk’ rammen her ved siden af).</p>
<p>Beløbet som
er målet er det minimumsbeløb der skal til når man skal have sin bog udgivet på
den her måde, men hvis der kommer mere ind end dette beløb, så bliver der trykt
så mange eksemplarer som der er råd til.</p>
<p>Nu en lille
synopsis:</p>
<p><i>Rumkrydseren Gateway
er på vej til en jordlignende planet, som jordens folk har givet arbejdstitlen
’New Earth One’. I begyndelsen troede man det var en ubeboet verden (ud over
eventuelt dyreliv) som jordens milliarder af mennesker kunne overtage. Man
begynder derfor at planlægge en ekspedition, som skal afgøre om denne planet
egner sig til kolonisation. Men under studiet af kloden er man blevet klar
over, at der findes intelligent liv og endda en moderne civilisation.</i></p>
<p><i>Formålet med
ekspeditionen ændres fra at være ren overtagelse, til at skulle skabe kontakt
med de indfødte og indlede et handelssamarbejde.</i></p>
<p><i>Jack Lee er en lettere
fordrukken psykolog og antropolog på ekspeditionen, og han sættes til at
analysere de sociale og samfundsmæssige forhold i dette samfund.</i></p>
<p><i>Hvad Jack finder, er
en nærmest paradisisk verden befolket af unge, sunde og smukke mennesker, og et
samfund hvor kriminalitet, grådighed og egoisme ikke eksisterer.</i></p>
<p><i>Men efterhånden som
Jacks undersøgelser afdækker mere og mere af systemets virkemåde, opdager han
at sandheden er en helt anden: Nogen forsøger tydeligvis at slå hele planetens
befolkning ihjel, gennem et fantastisk svindelnummer der indtil videre har kørt
i århundreder.</i></p>
<p><i>Men hvorfor?</i></p>
<p><i>Jack og hans ven,
IT-eksperten Boris, kommer på en opgave som ikke er af de helt små.</i></p>
<p>Det er en
spændende bog, som jeg selv har haft lyst til at læse igen siden jeg skrev den.</p>
<p>For yderligere

<p>Mads Aggerholm</p>
<p></p></div>","Mit navn er
Mads Aggerholm. Jeg er 47 år, og har arbejdet som programmør i de fleste af
dem.
Hele mit
liv har jeg læst masser af science-fiction (og også andre bøger) og i 26 år har
jeg haft ideen til en science-fiction historie til at ligge og ulme i hovedet.
Nu har jeg
endelig fået den skrevet. Og den er god, venner!
Så nu skal
den udgives!
Men
science-fiction er noget som forlagene helst ikke vil røre med en tres meter
lang ildtang – med mindre det er skrevet af gamle, velkonsoliderede forfattere.
Det selskab tilhører jeg endnu ikke...!
Men den tog
tid at skrive, og den skal altså trykkes!
Derfor vil
jeg prøve sådan et af de her selvudgiver-forlag, men da mine midler er
begrænsede forsøger jeg at rejse pengene ad den her vej. Det er belønninger til
bidragsyderne (nærmere herom på ’Select a Perk’ rammen her ved siden af).
Beløbet som
er målet er det minimumsbeløb der skal til når man skal have sin bog udgivet på
den her måde, men hvis der kommer mere ind end dette beløb, så bliver der trykt
så mange eksemplarer som der er råd til.
Nu en lille
synopsis:
Rumkrydseren Gateway
er på vej til en jordlignende planet, som jordens folk har givet arbejdstitlen
’New Earth One’. I begyndelsen troede man det var en ubeboet verden (ud over
eventuelt dyreliv) som jordens milliarder af mennesker kunne overtage. Man
begynder derfor at planlægge en ekspedition, som skal afgøre om denne planet
egner sig til kolonisation. Men under studiet af kloden er man blevet klar
over, at der findes intelligent liv og endda en moderne civilisation.
Formålet med
ekspeditionen ændres fra at være ren overtagelse, til at skulle skabe kontakt
med de indfødte og indlede et handelssamarbejde.
Jack Lee er en lettere
fordrukken psykolog og antropolog på ekspeditionen, og han sættes til at
analysere de sociale og samfundsmæssige forhold i dette samfund.
Hvad Jack finder, er
en nærmest paradisisk verden befolket af unge, sunde og smukke mennesker, og et
samfund hvor kriminalitet, grådighed og egoisme ikke eksisterer.
Men efterhånden som
Jacks undersøgelser afdækker mere og mere af systemets virkemåde, opdager han
at sandheden er en helt anden: Nogen forsøger tydeligvis at slå hele planetens
befolkning ihjel, gennem et fantastisk svindelnummer der indtil videre har kørt
i århundreder.
Men hvorfor?
Jack og hans ven,
IT-eksperten Boris, kommer på en opgave som ikke er af de helt små.
Det er en
spændende bog, som jeg selv har haft lyst til at læse igen siden jeg skrev den.
For yderligere
at vække interessen følger her et uddrag: Første del af Kapitel seks, hvor
ekspeditionen gør klar til første møde med planetens indfødte og deres
civilisation: Uddrag, Føste del af sjette kapitel
God
læselyst!
Og byd ind,
folkens! Lad os få den her i luften!

<li>Rewards and Shipping: the cost of those add up, so a portion of the money raised will go toward getting people their perks.</li>
<li>Fees, Fees, and More Fees: campaigns aren't run here for nothing, and PayPal takes a chunk of change too, so some money has to go to those dudes.</li>

River is a werewolf.The life of an alpha female wolf was irrevocably changed the night she was attacked and bitten, and awoke confused, alone, and human. Three years later, thrust into a world where she doesn’t belong and living in foster care, River barely tolerates humanity and still doesn’t know who bit her or why.But River isn’t as alone as she previously thought; someone’s been watching her, someone who holds the answers she’s been seeking. And though the human who changed her seems to be a step ahead of her at every turn, River is determined to beat his game and return to her pack and mate.And as if being stuck in a world she hates, with a life she never asked for, and faced with a destiny she doesn’t want wasn’t bad enough, River still must find a way to survive every human’s greatest challenge: high school.In 2006, a little book by a young writer (me!) with a small press was released. Simply called River, it was a unique take on werewolves, centering around a wolf who was bitten and turned into a human girl. Readers and reviewers connected with the protagonist's abrasive nature and utter contempt for humanity, and it later won the 2007 Best Fantasy Eppie Award (tied with Dragon's Gold by Piers Anthony and Robert E. Margroff). River has been out of print for a year, and now I'd like your help to bring her back again...with a bit of a facelift. She's received some rewrites, maintaining the existing, character-driven story you remember but updating it a bit (when written in 2003, I had NO IDEA video rental stores would no longer be a thing in less than a decade). Some nifty perks are lined up if you can contribute.Put simply, this book isn't happening without the fans. Here's where the money's going:
Proofreading: because the book has been almost entirely rewritten, typo demons have undoubtedly started to multiply. Extra sets of eyes are needed to go over everything, and proofers deserve to be paid for their time. 
Stock Images: stock's not cheap. At least not the good stuff. Relaunching this book means doing it right, and having the right cover art.
Printer Set-Up Fees: going with a good quality printer and good distribution means both the interior and exterior will cost more than a few pennies to upload.
Rewards and Shipping: the cost of those add up, so a portion of the money raised will go toward getting people their perks.
Fees, Fees, and More Fees: campaigns aren't run here for nothing, and PayPal takes a chunk of change too, so some money has to go to those dudes.
If there's money left over after paying people and shipping prizes, but not as far as the stretch goals, it'll possibly go towards some online ads, funds for self-pubbing future projects (or releasing my other books in print), and/or vet bills for my critters as they pop up a lot around my house. Basically, don't expect me to be rolling around in wads of cash--I don't have time for that.

<li>I'm Alia Papageorgiou the Founding Editor of The Brussels Chronicle who has been in journalism for the last eight years and has lost count of how many people have told me they wish they still had something like The Bulletin weekly in Brussels, but better.</li>
<li>So I've decided to launch a call for help in order to produce this and then build from there.</li>
<li>I won't be able to do this without your help! So thanks for letting me know if this is something that you also feel is missing from our city.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>In more detail:</p><ul>
<li>I have put 15,000 Euro as a round figure as I know the writing costs for the rest of the year will be met by this sum. This is strictly going to the production of content, by great writers, on Brussels in Brussels, with a proofreader in Bristol!  </li>
<li>We'll bring you great stories, ideas, collaborative works and a Brussels in depth weekly, with some literary references and writings to curl up with on a Sunday.</li>
<li>If the goal isn't completely reached whatever funds are raised will still go to the production of the first issue of Brussels Magazine, a weekend glossy planned for your weekend pleasure from January 2015. </li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Impact</h3><p>Your contribution will go towards bringing a more holistic view of Brussels alive, I see all different facets of the city , EU, military, lobby, civil servant, bus driver, migrant woman, journalist, art curator, director, creator, vendor,  but never one complete picture, this is our chance for a real profile.</p><ul>
<li>This project will contribute to the English speaking and anglophone seeking community, as well as that all future editions and profits will use 15% of their profits to go towards new media training for aspiring journalists in Brussels (but that's getting ahead of ourselves).</li>
<li>Following experiences in Brussels with European political newspaper New Europe, copy editing The Word magazine and events like the Personal Democracy Forum and Twestival this will bring together all that expertise and take it one step further with your help.</li>
<li>I want to put a great, detailed and thoughtful news site and as soon as I can, magazine in your hands about the things that matter to you and the place you live. </li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>No worries if funding or online payments aren't your thing.</p><ul>
<li>Feel free to spread the word and make some noise about The Brussels Chronicle and Brussels Magazine.</li>

</ul><p></p><p>Many thanks in advance :)</p></div>","Brussels ChronicleI want to bring a daily newsite to life that showcases Brussels for what it is , an extremely livable city.
I'm Alia Papageorgiou the Founding Editor of The Brussels Chronicle who has been in journalism for the last eight years and has lost count of how many people have told me they wish they still had something like The Bulletin weekly in Brussels, but better.
So I've decided to launch a call for help in order to produce this and then build from there.
I won't be able to do this without your help! So thanks for letting me know if this is something that you also feel is missing from our city.
What We Need & What You GetIn more detail:
I have put 15,000 Euro as a round figure as I know the writing costs for the rest of the year will be met by this sum. This is strictly going to the production of content, by great writers, on Brussels in Brussels, with a proofreader in Bristol!  
We'll bring you great stories, ideas, collaborative works and a Brussels in depth weekly, with some literary references and writings to curl up with on a Sunday.
If the goal isn't completely reached whatever funds are raised will still go to the production of the first issue of Brussels Magazine, a weekend glossy planned for your weekend pleasure from January 2015. 
ImpactYour contribution will go towards bringing a more holistic view of Brussels alive, I see all different facets of the city , EU, military, lobby, civil servant, bus driver, migrant woman, journalist, art curator, director, creator, vendor,  but never one complete picture, this is our chance for a real profile.
This project will contribute to the English speaking and anglophone seeking community, as well as that all future editions and profits will use 15% of their profits to go towards new media training for aspiring journalists in Brussels (but that's getting ahead of ourselves).
Following experiences in Brussels with European political newspaper New Europe, copy editing The Word magazine and events like the Personal Democracy Forum and Twestival this will bring together all that expertise and take it one step further with your help.
I want to put a great, detailed and thoughtful news site and as soon as I can, magazine in your hands about the things that matter to you and the place you live. 
Other Ways You Can HelpNo worries if funding or online payments aren't your thing.
Feel free to spread the word and make some noise about The Brussels Chronicle and Brussels Magazine.

ABOUT WELCOME TABLE PRESS
""The world is everywhere whispering essays."" --Alexander Smith
We are an all-volunteer, independent nonprofit press devoted to publishing & celebrating the essay, in all its forms. CLICK HERE TO LEARN MORE.
The essay is a chameleon, at once formal and scholarly, lyrical and narrative, personal and political, educational and secretive, humorous and curmudgeonly, loud and quiet. It is endangered and dangerous, adaptable and perishable. Your contributions will help us put bold and provocative literature into the hands of readers, writers, students, and teachers. 

ALL OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS WE RECEIVE COME FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO BELIEVE IN INDEPENDENT PUBLISHING.
HOW YOU CAN HELP SUPPORT OUR WORK


All contributions collected from this Indiegogo campaign will be directed toward the printing and distribution of our second print book, ESSAYING THE ESSAY, edited by David Lazar.

ESSAYING THE ESSAY is a must-have compendium of essays on the essay, showcasing diverse meditations on the form  by a wide range of writers throughout history, including Michel de Montaigne, Samuel Johnson, Virginia Woolf, Cynthia Ozick, Phillip Lopate, Robert Atwan, Lia Purpura, and John D'Agata.


Your support will help build our self-sufficiency (pre-press, printing, and advertising are expensive; the larger the print run, the lower the cost per title; distributing books costs money too).
The more funding we secure, the greater the possibility for us to offer:


Discounts for students, teachers, and writers.

Letterpress-printed, limited-edition versions of our titles, whose sales will help futher support our publishing and educational activities.

Publishing internships to more students.

Our first Indiegogo campaign, Everywhere Whispering Essays, funded the printing and distribution of our first print title, You. An Anthology of Essays Devoted to the Second Person, edited by Kim Dana Kupperman, with Heather G. Simons and James M. Chesbro.
YOU. AN ANTHOLOGY is a first-of-its-kind collection, featuring essays that explore failure, planetary movement, and love, among a variety of topics. The up close and personal candor of these autobiographical, lyric, personal, and segmented narratives is tempered by the distance, intimacy, humor, and unsentimental tenderness that the second-person point of view affords both writer and reader.OUR TRACK RECORD


Welcome Table Press has published (and distributed at no cost) ten electronic and six limited-edition, print issues of its periodical pamphlet series, OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON PRACTICE & FORM, featuring spoken essays derived from talks delivered at symposia, conferences, and other gatherings where friends of the essay might be found. Currently in production are six additional issues.
Two  co-sponsored by   Fordham University's Creative Writing Program and featuring Robert Atwan, Vivian Gornick, Phillip Lopate, Jerald Walker, Brian Doyle, Lia Purpura, Barbara Hurd, Robin Hemley, Idiots' Books, editors from national periodicals, and many other writers and teachers of the essay.                 Click HERE to download FREE PDFs of these important essays. 

Welcome Table Press is home to FOOD FOR THOUGHT, a hand-sewn, miniature/limited-edition periodical whose two volumes were published between 2002-2006 and featured lyric essays, poetry, and recipes for local, seasonal dishes. The twelve issues of FOOD FOR THOUGHT are preserved at SUNY Buffalo's Special Collections library.
We plan to re-create FOOD FOR THOUGHT NOTES as a series of video essays.
Because we are dedicated to spreading the word about the essay, our press has hosted and co-sponsored several low-cost or free educational events, including:
Two symposia on the essay, co-sponsored by      
Fordham University's Creative Writing Program andfeaturing Robert Atwan, Vivian Gornick, Phillip Lopate, Jerald Walker, Brian Doyle, Lia Purpura, Barbara Hurd, Robin Hemley, Idiots' Books, editors from national periodicals, and many other writers and teachers of the essay.

Internships for creative-writing students: we have been working with editorial interns for several years 
and are currently working with the Fairfield University's low-residency MFA Program to provide internships in its publishing concentration.

A book arts workshop in a rural community.

Fundraiser readings by the literary touring group Three Genres in the Rain, which benefitted organizations devoted to the reading and writing.
YOUR CONTRIBUTION IS TAX DEDUCTIBLE. Welcome Table Press was incorporated as a nonprofit organization in 2008 and granted 501(c)(3) status in 2009.

<br/>To reduce the expenses for the book we decided to print the book as a stapled booklet. This way we reduce the costs by 2/3 and are able to print <i>Synchronicity</i> in colour.

<p><i>Hanging Lantern Review</i> is a literary journal created, curated, and published by High School students at SLO Classical Academy in San Luis Obispo, California. We started in 2013 to provide student artists in our area a beautiful, quality publication in which to publish their poetry, fiction, non-fiction, art, and photography. We are the only annual print journal in our county publishing exclusively middle school and high school work. The journal, along with our quarterly Bifrost Reading Series, website, and annual reading and release party, provide a rich literary community experience on the Central Coast for young writers and the fans of their work. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

Our Story
Hanging Lantern Review is a literary journal created, curated, and published by High School students at SLO Classical Academy in San Luis Obispo, California. We started in 2013 to provide student artists in our area a beautiful, quality publication in which to publish their poetry, fiction, non-fiction, art, and photography. We are the only annual print journal in our county publishing exclusively middle school and high school work. The journal, along with our quarterly Bifrost Reading Series, website, and annual reading and release party, provide a rich literary community experience on the Central Coast for young writers and the fans of their work.

Bolstered by my strength of fighting cancer, I found the license to fully discover and accept my personhood, and consider my life choices in this hard-fought new context. This book is an homage to the journey of life. It is a tribute to the struggle of finding your own power, and cultivating your life’s trajectory.<br/>---<br/>My name is Indira Kaur Ahluwalia, and I am the author of <i>Fast Forward to Hope</i>. I wrote this book because I have been enriched by my experiences of fighting the odds, and have learned how to live. My humble aspiration is that my experiences provide you with insights to fast forward through your own challenges on your way to finding hope and courage.<br/><br/>In reading this book, I trust that you will discover that you have the capacity within yourself to take on life with all of its provocations, the ability to make choices to shape your path, and that, indeed, you are enough. As I share my passion for life and the might of self-awareness, I invite you to use this book to help you face your own fears and doubts, and to get ahead of them so that you can choose the outcomes you desire. I hope that the insights I have gained can become your tools for persevering.<br/><br/>I was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer with extensive bone metastasis in 2007, and I remain in treatment to keep the cancer under control. I had to learn to acknowledge my fears and get comfortable with my mortality as much as my vulnerability to build hope and strength. This book explores life in the shadow of death, and shares the process of going from surviving to living well. Whatever the odds, we can choose to find our courage to build on the smallest hope, to will ourselves to live our lives on its merits, on our own terms, and live it as well as possible.<br/><br/>This book is a nonfiction memoir that speaks to people fighting cancer, or whatever it is that is overpowering them. It is for those who want to look at challenges and struggles in a new light. I also wrote this for medical professionals, big Pharma executives, scientists, and researchers for them to experience cancer and other medical issues from the patient’s perspective.<br/><br/><i>Fast Forward to Hope </i>will be of value to you if you are looking to understand the realities of living with a cancer diagnosis, and finding your way through the odds to live with gratitude. Regardless of what your odds are, you will be able to explore your own truth as you walk with me through mine. I have curated the lessons I have learned since my diagnosis to keep hope strong, and it is my humble desire that you find one or two of them useful and applicable in your life.</p><h2><strong>The Book - <i>Fast Forward to Hope</i></strong></h2><p>This book is divided into three parts.<br/><br/>In Part One, I share the story about my life with cancer (the “what”). In Part Two, I explore what enables me to continue to persevere even as I remain in treatment (the “how”). Ultimately, in Part Three, I try to understand why this journey was necessary for me, and how I have molded my life based on what I have learned (the “why”).<br/><br/>Truth be told, I wrote the last part first. I needed to understand for myself what I have gained from my challenges. In retrospect, I realized that I had unknowingly been an active participant in my recovery and healing. And that I have gained tremendously from being able to apply the lessons learned from dealing with cancer across all aspects of my life.<br/><br/>Fortified with this conscious understanding, I was then able to re-live the experience of getting cancer in Part One of the book. I found myself writing more to the process of getting diagnosed than the mechanics of the treatment. Writing the “what” part was hard in some places as I tried to write from the authenticity of the experience from my current place of stability. As I wrote, I walked through the realities of how I slowly found my feet, started to build courage, and take charge to stay one step ahead of the challenges.<br/><br/>In Part Two, I took a breath. I devoted this part to give respect to three major enablers that have carried me forward - science, humanity, and faith. I took on the business of science as well as paid heed to alternative therapies. In addressing humanity, I shared some difficulties, but mostly focused on the kindness of strangers and the genuine care I received from people across all parts of my life who held me in their love. With faith, I tried to articulate the light I followed as it radiated from my North Star.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I found my tools intuitively one at a time, and now - with <i>Fast Forward to Hope</i> - I have a tool kit I can share.</p><h2><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h2><p><i>Fast Forward to Hope</i> will be published with New Degree Press.

<p>We believe it is time for women to <strong><em>revolutionize</em></strong> the way they live, love and lead. And we have an inspiring vision and a guiding pathway to do just that!</p>
<p>Why does this matter? For five decades women have been strenuously adapting to a ""hypermasculine"" world built on the needs and values of the past.  That world was not able to see or activate <strong>all</strong> of our most potent, creative and joy-bringing potential. </p>
<p>The primary <strong><em>way of being</em></strong> for women today is the result of this adaptation. And it has left many of us exhausted, unhealthy, and doubting ourselves. We long for something more fulfilling, more in tune with our nature, more able to make a difference in the world.</p>
<p>Further, the boundaries between our personal and professional lives are dissolving.  In a rapidly globalizing, massively interconnected world, we need to leverage, rather than resist, the interdependence between Living, Loving, and Leading. </p>
<p><img alt=""Living Loving Leading"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/527126/pictures/full/20121107125024-LLL-circles-more-white.jpg?1352321440"" src="""" style=""margin: 5px; float: left;""/></p>
<p>  <img alt=""woman future present"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/527413/pictures/full/20121107152518-Woman_future-presentMD.jpg?1352330733"" src="""" style=""margin: 5px;""/></p>
<p>These turbulent and unpredictable times are calling forth a radically different way of being from us all. Which means we have to make a kind of<em><strong> evolutionary</strong></em> move to the <strong>next level of our capacity and fullness</strong> as women, bringing all of who we are into the world--and into the next level of co-creative relationship with men.</p>
<p><strong>Now that’s </strong><em><strong>R-evolutionary! </strong></em></p>
<h2><strong>Our Project</strong></h2>
<p>After 12 years of research and field-testing with hundreds of women whose <strong>lives were profoundly changed</strong> by our deeply transformative leadership programs, we knew that in order to fulfill our mission, <strong>we must bring what we’ve learned out into the world </strong>in a book<strong>, </strong>so that it could benefit many more women.</p>
<p>We have done just that in writing the first draft! Now we are turning to Indiegogo—and to you---to fund the manuscript completion, editing, graphics and publishing so that this book can be a powerful catalyst of change for women--for the world!</p>
<p>We believe that this book can play a key role in bringing forth a startlingly <strong>new paradigm of leadership</strong> for women.  It is truly what our unprecedented times are calling forth. This book is not a tweak on the old, heroic industrial age model, but a magnetic and <strong>positive image of the future</strong> that can pull us all forward. </p>
<p>This new paradigm will finally resonate with all of who we are as women, and who we are becoming.</p>
<h2><strong>Who Are We?</strong></h2>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/527421/pictures/original/20121107152817-Unknown-2_2.jpeg?1352330897"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></strong></p>
<p>We are creative partners in an innovative, woman-owned social enterprise, <a href=""http://www.koreevolution.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Kore Evolution,</span></strong></a> dedicated to the mission of <strong><em>revolutionizing the way women live, love and lead so that they are able to dynamically shape these rapidly evolving times for future generations.  </em></strong></p>
<p>In alliance with <a href=""http://www.saybrook.edu/lios"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">LIOS Graduate College of Leadership at Saybrook University</span></strong>,</a> our women’s leadership certification combines an academically sound, rigorous, research-based curriculum with the ageless wisdom traditions, arts, and the deep practice of an <strong>urban mystery school.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>The Timing</strong></h2>
<p>The right timing for this book to have maximum positive impact is soon after we collectively cross over that 2012 threshold--when we are all more open to a new worldview.</p>
<p><strong>We want this book to be in the hands of women by early 2013</strong>--not in the 2 years that traditional publishing would take. We've discovered some counter-intuitive and potentially controversial things about this emerging new paradigm of leadership that will be especially suited to women. <strong>We want to be able to write it exactly as we see it!</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Who's This Project For?</strong></h2>
<p>This book is <em><strong>for women</strong></em> who think it makes sense to 'be the change they want to see in the world', and it is <strong><em>for men</em> </strong>who support the emergence of wise, loving and powerful women as agents of this creative change!</p>
<p><img alt=""Sovereign Self"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/527883/pictures/full/20121107200017-royal-self.jpg?1352347247"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 5px;""/></p>
<p>It will inspire and guide those who are determined to artfully navigate these wildly chaotic and creative times--no matter what life dishes up—while holding in their hearts a dream of co-creating a far better future for us all.  </p>
<p>Although <strong>women leaders</strong> will find this book life-changing, it is also intended for women who are <strong>not in traditional positions of authority and power</strong>, who have influence in other ways and are feeling a call to something more.  It may be you—or someone you know.</p>
<h2><strong>What's This Book About?</strong></h2>
<p>After more than a decade of designing, delivering, researching, and refining our highly successful suite of<a href=""http://koreevolution.com/ourprograms/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">women’s leadership development programs,</span></a> we began to notice a significant shift in our graduates.</p>
<p>They had access to the <strong>full spectrum</strong> of their beings – all of their <strong>Feminine and Masculine essences.</strong> They glowed with a radiant presence, their actions were aligned with their intentions, and they had a remarkable sense of self-confidence and true authority. They had unlocked a joyful creativity and an authentic way of being that was powerfully transformative.</p>
<h3>We call this emerging woman<strong>...</strong>
</h3>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/527487/pictures/original/20121107155803-Mysterial_Woman.jpg?1352332682"" src="""" style=""margin: 5px;""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Mysterial </strong>is a linguistic merging of the two words <strong>Mystery and Medial - </strong>two characteristics we saw consistently in these women. They had a remarkable ease with the unknown, chaotic and ambiguous – the Mystery, and they had developed the Medial capacity to bridge between differences, manage reactivity and find a creative middle way in challenging situations.</p>
<p>And when these two elements were integrally combined an inner alchemy occurred that led to a profound inner upgrade - revealing a radically new way of being, with many more creative options for action.</p>
<p>We call this of way of being in the world -<strong> The Way of the Mysterial Woman.  <br/></strong></p>
<h3><strong><img alt=""urban mystery school"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/527466/pictures/full/20121107154920-iStock_000015372436_Small.jpg?1352332169"" src="""" style=""margin: 5px;""/></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>An Inspiring Vision and a Guiding Pathway </strong></h3>
<p>There is a saying that goes, “If you can see it, you can be it.” Our book clearly articulates this new way of living, loving and leading so that you can see an alternative and inspiring vision of women's leadership. And it lays out the developmental pathway so that you can ‘be it’. </p>
<p>We decoded an elegant developmental pathway, designed specifically for women, that consists of five distinct and sequential steps: <strong>The Mysterial Sequence™.</strong>  Through engaging case studies, drawn from our amazing graduates, our book describes the process for an individual woman in detail.  </p>
<p>Our book will also show that the Mysterial Sequence carries a very deep code, mapping directly to the major waves of cultural evolution from the very earliest days of our human family, to what is emerging now.</p>
<p>Here is a sneak preview of the outcomes of the deep work of transformation at each stage:</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/514307/pictures/original/20121030112644-Mysterial-Sequence-chart-bw2.jpg?1351621604"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Step by step, The Mysterial Sequence opens an inner channel by unblocking and cultivating the natural healthy flow of our most primary Yin (Feminine) and Yang (Masculine) essences.  The final result is the emergence of a woman’s free flowing and natural Mysterial Leadership.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Women?</strong></h2>
<p>It’s so easy to take for granted all the powerful, capable women making things happen in the workplace and everywhere else. Yet this has been the case only <strong>within the last 50 years</strong>! It can be hard to appreciate the dramatic learning curve that women climbed in order to enter a world that for over five thousand years had been primarily organized by and for men (not wrong...just how it was).</p>
<p>Adapting to our hypermasculine environment wasn’t a mistake—it was a giant step for women. But squeezing into this ill-fitting suit leaves many of us today <strong>dissatisfied, unfulfilled, anxious, depressed, overweight, exhausted, and soul-deadened</strong>, to name just a few. Many women interpret these symptoms as their personal failure, <strong>yet our book will show that these are actually signs of their readiness for growth into Mysterial women.</strong></p>
<p>By drawing upon futurists, scientists, developmental theorists, psychologists, and historians, our book shows clearly why women who have awakened to their full potential are going to be <strong>a rising force in the 21st century</strong>--and how they will partner in powerful co-creative ways with men.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Now?</strong></h2>
<p>Our world is poised at a critical tipping point, and history shows us that with similar inflections in the past, the world becomes very different, very quickly. Our research draws upon trends and insights into this fast approaching future that is, surprisingly, imbued with <strong>new and more complex feminine values and expressions - </strong>a dramatic break from our current cultural stereotypes.  </p>
<p><strong>For example,</strong> our culture currently values endless, 24/7 growth. The steeper and straighter the incline, the better! Society admires the hero who pushes through and makes it happen.  Yet this eventually leads to crashes and tangles in our systems and our bodies. It’s unsustainable in the long run. In the coming future, we will recognize the importance of more complex restorative cycles in our systems, and in biological beings, and the value of allowing a creative project to gestate in right timing for the greatest benefit for all. We call this “unfolding the emergent”.   </p>
<p>As change continues to accelerate, we will value the capacity not only for rational analysis, but for multidimensional knowing-drawing upon our physical, emotional, cognitive, intuitive, and spiritual intelligences and using them skillfully together. That means greater wisdom and ease in relationship with one's self, with others, and the world.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/514312/pictures/original/20121030112742-Unknown.jpeg?1351621683"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>And there’s lots more that we will share in our book about what it means in terms of very specific capacities for women to awaken their Mysterial Leadership capacity. </p>
<h2><strong>Help us a Launch Mysterial Movement</strong></h2>
<p>We have learned that when women recognize themselves as Mysterials, they want to join with other Mysterial women. Our book can help them do that, as we will be offering ways for women to connect. We fully expect a Mysterial movement to materialize in the future, as these women join forces and hearts.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p></div>","Join the R-evolution!
We believe it is time for women to revolutionize the way they live, love and lead. And we have an inspiring vision and a guiding pathway to do just that!
Why does this matter? For five decades women have been strenuously adapting to a ""hypermasculine"" world built on the needs and values of the past.  That world was not able to see or activate all of our most potent, creative and joy-bringing potential. 
The primary way of being for women today is the result of this adaptation. And it has left many of us exhausted, unhealthy, and doubting ourselves. We long for something more fulfilling, more in tune with our nature, more able to make a difference in the world.
Further, the boundaries between our personal and professional lives are dissolving.  In a rapidly globalizing, massively interconnected world, we need to leverage, rather than resist, the interdependence between Living, Loving, and Leading. 

  
These turbulent and unpredictable times are calling forth a radically different way of being from us all. Which means we have to make a kind of evolutionary move to the next level of our capacity and fullness as women, bringing all of who we are into the world--and into the next level of co-creative relationship with men.
Now that’s R-evolutionary! 
Our Project
After 12 years of research and field-testing with hundreds of women whose lives were profoundly changed by our deeply transformative leadership programs, we knew that in order to fulfill our mission, we must bring what we’ve learned out into the world in a book, so that it could benefit many more women.
We have done just that in writing the first draft! Now we are turning to Indiegogo—and to you---to fund the manuscript completion, editing, graphics and publishing so that this book can be a powerful catalyst of change for women--for the world!
We believe that this book can play a key role in bringing forth a startlingly new paradigm of leadership for women.  It is truly what our unprecedented times are calling forth. This book is not a tweak on the old, heroic industrial age model, but a magnetic and positive image of the future that can pull us all forward. 
This new paradigm will finally resonate with all of who we are as women, and who we are becoming.
Who Are We?

We are creative partners in an innovative, woman-owned social enterprise, Kore Evolution, dedicated to the mission of revolutionizing the way women live, love and lead so that they are able to dynamically shape these rapidly evolving times for future generations.  
In alliance with LIOS Graduate College of Leadership at Saybrook University, our women’s leadership certification combines an academically sound, rigorous, research-based curriculum with the ageless wisdom traditions, arts, and the deep practice of an urban mystery school.
The Timing
The right timing for this book to have maximum positive impact is soon after we collectively cross over that 2012 threshold--when we are all more open to a new worldview.
We want this book to be in the hands of women by early 2013--not in the 2 years that traditional publishing would take. We've discovered some counter-intuitive and potentially controversial things about this emerging new paradigm of leadership that will be especially suited to women. We want to be able to write it exactly as we see it!
Who's This Project For?
This book is for women who think it makes sense to 'be the change they want to see in the world', and it is for men who support the emergence of wise, loving and powerful women as agents of this creative change!

It will inspire and guide those who are determined to artfully navigate these wildly chaotic and creative times--no matter what life dishes up—while holding in their hearts a dream of co-creating a far better future for us all.  
Although women leaders will find this book life-changing, it is also intended for women who are not in traditional positions of authority and power, who have influence in other ways and are feeling a call to something more.  It may be you—or someone you know.
What's This Book About?
After more than a decade of designing, delivering, researching, and refining our highly successful suite of women’s leadership development programs, we began to notice a significant shift in our graduates.
They had access to the full spectrum of their beings – all of their Feminine and Masculine essences. They glowed with a radiant presence, their actions were aligned with their intentions, and they had a remarkable sense of self-confidence and true authority. They had unlocked a joyful creativity and an authentic way of being that was powerfully transformative.
We call this emerging woman...


Mysterial is a linguistic merging of the two words Mystery and Medial - two characteristics we saw consistently in these women. They had a remarkable ease with the unknown, chaotic and ambiguous – the Mystery, and they had developed the Medial capacity to bridge between differences, manage reactivity and find a creative middle way in challenging situations.
And when these two elements were integrally combined an inner alchemy occurred that led to a profound inner upgrade - revealing a radically new way of being, with many more creative options for action.
We call this of way of being in the world - The Way of the Mysterial Woman.  

An Inspiring Vision and a Guiding Pathway 
There is a saying that goes, “If you can see it, you can be it.” Our book clearly articulates this new way of living, loving and leading so that you can see an alternative and inspiring vision of women's leadership. And it lays out the developmental pathway so that you can ‘be it’. 
We decoded an elegant developmental pathway, designed specifically for women, that consists of five distinct and sequential steps: The Mysterial Sequence™.  Through engaging case studies, drawn from our amazing graduates, our book describes the process for an individual woman in detail.  
Our book will also show that the Mysterial Sequence carries a very deep code, mapping directly to the major waves of cultural evolution from the very earliest days of our human family, to what is emerging now.
Here is a sneak preview of the outcomes of the deep work of transformation at each stage:

Step by step, The Mysterial Sequence opens an inner channel by unblocking and cultivating the natural healthy flow of our most primary Yin (Feminine) and Yang (Masculine) essences.  The final result is the emergence of a woman’s free flowing and natural Mysterial Leadership.

<h3>What is Mighty Strong Girls and why should you care? </h3>
<p>Mighty Strong Girls is an alternative magazine, offering girls a realistic and positive perspective of their gender. It launched in November 2012 as an electronic magazine, but many moms and girls are asking for a printed version. How awesome would it be to see Mighty Strong Girls at grocery store checkout stands someday! </p>
<p>Amy Denney, the publisher and founder of the ministry, has a background in journalism. She previously conceived and launched Springfield's Own magazine, a glossy, full-color lifestyle magazine affiliated with the State Journal-Register. </p>
<p>She spent the past several years exploring programs for girls and working with teen girls at her church. Amy found many great programs but nothing that connected 100 percent with her vision to educate, empower, equip and encourage girls to discover their unique gifts and find their identity in Christ. </p>
<p>With your help, we can get these important messages of TRUTH into the hands of more girls. We already know 75 percent of women and girls want to see more diversity and realistic body types in media. <strong>Now you can be a part of making that happen!</strong> This is an exciting opportunity for you to do something very tangible and super positive to help a generation of girls! </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It will cost $7,920, with printer expenses and fees, to get 2,000 copies of an 80-page magazine into circulation in central Illinois. We are seeking 80 individuals, businesses, churches or organizations who will become our PARTNERS IN PRINT. We set our goal lower than that because we've already collected a few and plan to seek partnerships in other venues, too! </p>
<p>For $99, you can ""buy a page."" That's the cost of printing 2,000 copies of one magazine page. In turn, we will print 140-character messages from all of our partners on special pages in the magazine. This is a great way to send a love note to your own daughter or granddaughter, or to affirm beauty to all girls! Partners will also receive a complimentary copy of the magazine! </p>
<p>The great part of this approach is that we won't have to rely on advertising dollars, and we can keep out the negative messages that are so prevalent in popular magazines.</p>
<p>If you can't afford it yourself, how about doing it with extended family or a group at your office or Sunday school class? Collect money for casual days, skip on a meal out every month or sell something you don't use or need anymore. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal for our summer issue, we will use your donation with other fundraising projects to print our back-to-school issue in September. We would include your message in the first issue we are able to print. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Girls are already being moved to action by Mighty Strong Girls. In one case, a girl from Westside Christian Church in Springfield raised money to buy 230 Mighty Strong Girls T-shirts and recruited volunteers to write love notes to girls in Kenya, as reminder that they are valuable creations of God. She's delivering them on her mission trip this summer! Girls in Athens, Illinois, led a worship service to share the love of Christ with their congregation. </p>
<p>They are contributors to the magazine. They are the stories. They are passionate about seeking and sharing a healthy, positive body image through Mighty Strong Girls. </p>
<p>Take a look at the website at <a href=""http://www.mightystronggirls.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mightystronggirls.com</a>. We already have a great start, plenty of experience and all tools we need. What we require now are the financial resources and prayers to lift off and let girls in central Illinois see what they want — realistic, diverse and faith-filled content in a magazine that covers everything from fashion and boys to faith and arts &amp; crafts. </p>

What is Life.Data.Tech?
Your conceptions of life are backed by some serious data, whether you recognize it or not. We’re interested in the technology that brings this data to the forefront, and we’d like to share our findings with you in a long-form, transparent format that puts you closer to the source.
That means the best writers and the best minds producing long-form content that’s worth reading. From articles, to features, to editorials, interviews, infographics, and more, you can expect thoughtful, investigative literary pieces from Life.Data.Tech.
Writers are Life.Data.Tech’s rockstars. We give them flexible and fair licensing agreements, and they give the world stories worth reading. Fair trade? Fair trade. Not only that, but our writers are part of the story. How they found information, their process of writing, and the context of their interviews should be a part of their stories.
Of course, it’s not just about the writers… it’s about the readers too. The Life.Data.Tech golden rule is: Don’t waste our readers’ time. Don’t bullshit them. Make it easy for them to access our great content, and invite them to participate in every aspect of our operations.
The Data is the Story
Information is power. As often as possible, we will expose readers to the raw data. Full transcripts, the tables, the charts – as much data as they can handle, and in an accessible format. If you’ve ever read a story and found yourself wishing you could simply read the writer’s source material, you’re going to like us. We invite the readers to use the data to second guess us.
Backstage With Second Geek
Second Geek, as in, second opinion. Second Geek (2G) is our community website, where we take the readers backstage and invite them to participate in our editorial process. They can propose writers, stories, topics, and more. We want writers who will engage the reader, and continue the story with them after the story is published.

<p>I am Abhishek Roy. A software
engineer by profession, a writer and photographer by passion and a center of
constant creative ideas would be the correct way to describe me as a person. I
started writing stories and poems to unleash my feelings as I was not so good in
expressing my feelings through verbal communication. That is how this hobby of
writing started about 4 years back. My stories and poems are loosely based on
people whom I encounter in my daily life. The stories I write are usually works
of imagination marking a perfect blend of fantasy with reality while my poems
portray lives of real people. Till date I have written quite a few stories
(short, super short as well as long) and around 30 poems. I have published a
few of them online through Amazon kindle bookstore and have received mixed
reviews. (As expected for an amateur writer).</p>
<p> My
first success came at a short story competition for a leading newspaper in 2008
where my work was adjudicated as the Best Short Story Of the Season. I have
also written reviews for movies and music albums in a few local newspapers and
journals. I am often invited to write music reviews for the monthly newsletter
at my workplace. (Check the media section for cover images of some of my works)</p>
<h3><b>The Project</b></h3>
<p>I have been planning on writing my
next one which is currently my dream project (I have been planning the plot
over the last two years). It will be a novel of epic proportion about Ourselves,
Our Governments, God, Religions and our very existence itself. It will be a
fiction but at the same time it will be based on facts with references to
mythologies. I am working very hard researching the stuff in order to get my
facts correct when I start writing it. I plan to begin around May 2014 and it
should be completed by October 2014. </p>
<p>I just completed my current story.This<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> one deals with the adventures of a spy. It has lots of thrills and skills involved-  violence, drama, emotions and lots of twists and turns. The image of the Eye that you can see above is from the cover of that story.</span></p>
<p>Since I'll start working on the book
around May and will take some time to complete it, as a perk for supporting the
campaign, I wanted to introduce my social experiment on episode based reading.
The experiment was already conducted on a group of friends when I wrote my
first story Eleven Bullets back in 2008.</p>
<p>The basic process is to divide and
write a story based on episodes (Just like in television series). As and when I
complete an episode, I'll share the same with you. So in general, you will be
receiving one episode at a time each week on your preferred reading medium.
This will keep you on the edge of your seats and make you curious on how the
story will proceed next week. As backers of my project, I'm offering you my
first story Eleven Bullets for free in form of weekly episodes. Once you
complete the same, you will receive weekly episodes of the story I am writing
right now (It is still unnamed, but it is based on that Indian spy, terrorism, espionage
and such cool stuff). And last but not the least, once you complete this, you
will start receiving episodes of my actual project as I write along. You can
even give me suggestions thereby making it a success one it is available to the
market.</p>
<p>Hold on. It's not over yet. You will
also get a digital version of the book before it is available for sale in the
market.</p>
<p>Pretty good deal don't you think. It
will keep you engaged for a year if you decide to pledge for me and my work
today.</p>
<p>(Check the media section for cover
images of some of my works)</p>
<h3><b>What We Need</b></h3>
<p>The novel that I am planning to
write, will require detailed editing by a professional once it is complete. As
per current estimates, it will require <b>$300 </b>for the first
level of editing and then around<b> $500</b> for the more detailed
editing from a second level of editor. Apart from these, will need to go
through Createspace to get hard copies of the book published through Amazon and
amazon kindle if no other publishing companies show interest (As I am an
amateur writer it is really difficult to find publishers unless you have access
to big contacts or your work gets a lot of promotion). So to get a minimum of <b>200
copies</b> to be printed through Createspace and then to send them over to
me for distribution through other channels apart from Amazon will take around <b>$700</b>.
The rest will be sold through Amazon. A kindle conversion fee will also be
charged based on the actual volume of the book i.e. Total number of words.</p>
<p>Apart from these, a basic press
release and setting up a dedicated website will take another<b> $300</b>.
Based on the amount raised, I'll decide whether or not to go for a marketing
package where the basic package is around <b>$500</b> which includes
printing of custom bookmarks promoting the book. I don't know as of now whether
there will be any other costs as well.</p>
<p>So in total approximately at least <b>$2500</b> will
be required to make the project successful.</p>
<h3><b>What You Get</b></h3>

<p>Hold on. It's not over yet. You will
also get a digital version of the book before it is available for sale in the

<p>And just when you thought it ended,
the deal gets even bigger. All the backers will have their names listed on my
book as contributors to the project.</p>
<p>Pretty good deal don't you think. It
will also keep you engaged for a year if you decide to pledge for me and my
work today.</p>
<h3><b>The Impact</b></h3>
<p>Any contribution you make will enable
me to reach my dream of actually publishing my big work in form of Digital as
well as Paperback editions. Also, your constant feedback will improve my
writing in general and also improve the actual content of the story before it
is out for the general public.</p>
<h3><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></h3>
<p>If you are unable to pledge for my
cause or are unsure about it, please help me in getting the word spread out to
other people who may genuinely be interested. Use your social networks to help
me rope people in. And who knows, maybe in future you will change your mind as
well and support the cause. </p>

like to thank you for visiting my campaign and reading through the information.</p>

<h3>Why Stories?<br/>
</h3>Some things are classic, though we see signs of them slipping away. Talking to each other with our voices, visiting friends, writing a letter. Through stories, we preserve our own unique voices and all their quirks, our faulty grammar, our profane syntax, our misspellings. Imagine what would happen if we let Kindle dictate the size of our pages and Twitter dictate the length of our phrases. Let's stretch back into our grandest selves. Viva la palabra!<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>
</div><div>
<h3>What a little moola can do...<br/>
</h3>
<p>Money raised will purchase collection boxes for bookstores, create promotional materials, keep business all nice and legit, print books and fund a stellar release party. Though there are 40 more days on this project, some funds are needed on the front end to get things going, and then at the back end to get the book into production, have it printed up, etc.</p>

To lead up to this arts library, I'll be cranking out a series of events. The first will be a story-collecting extravaganza that unifies Atlanta through words, called ""abacus: art of storytelling"". 
Like a photo captures a moment, we preserve moments in time by writing our stories. “Abacus: art of storytelling” seeks to present a time-capsule view of our shared history by allowing people to write a short story about a true event from their past that fits within the theme of ""Mixed Media"".
That means you can poke fun at Facebook, or talk about a television moment that transformed you. Divulge the artists’ secret you stumbled upon of using crumpled cans to create a masterpiece, or a trippy occurrence when you felt connected to the other side. Heck, if you want to stretch it really far, you can write on a mind-boggling medium coffee, medium rare steak, stretch the term as far as you can!
The stories collected will be used to varying degrees and bound into an anthology. The proceeds will fund Abacus Arts Library and future library events. The book will be released in March 2012 at a storytelling extravaganza at Room and Board.

Why Stories?
Some things are classic, though we see signs of them slipping away. Talking to each other with our voices, visiting friends, writing a letter. Through stories, we preserve our own unique voices and all their quirks, our faulty grammar, our profane syntax, our misspellings. Imagine what would happen if we let Kindle dictate the size of our pages and Twitter dictate the length of our phrases. Let's stretch back into our grandest selves. Viva la palabra!

What a little moola can do...

Money raised will purchase collection boxes for bookstores, create promotional materials, keep business all nice and legit, print books and fund a stellar release party. Though there are 40 more days on this project, some funds are needed on the front end to get things going, and then at the back end to get the book into production, have it printed up, etc.

Other Ways You Can Help
1. Volunteer with this cause.

2. Donate books to the library from this Amazon wish list. 

3. Share with your friends! Tweet, face, or whatever suits you. Thanks!

4. Write a letter and send it to a long-lost friend.

5. Recommend storytelling groups and lit-lovers that may want to be part of this project.

Many thanks!

Nightland Colouring Book follows a young child's journey through the night as Nightbird carries him between her wings across Nightland. There are many birds and beasts living in Nightforest, there are dragonboys and a witch with a thousand eyes. The child gets to see what happens to the Sun and the Moon at night. And he even finds out  what his parents are up to.
It is a book inspired by northern myth and folklore, visual traditions and landscapes. The cultural background and surroundings of my own childhood in South-Estonia, forests in every direction. 
Nightland Colouring Book reflects the understanding that there are things in the night that are best left alone but there are also hidden blessings. And help often comes unexpected. 
It is the kind of book I always wanted to experience. So I have created it.
I believe there is a need for an alternative to what is mostly offered and most easily accessible to very young children when it comes to books.
I believe young children deserve to be treated with respect. 
They deserve stories that are well written. 
They deserve questions that are left for them to answer. To be trusted to make up their own mind and at the same time to get to know the richness of where their cultural roots can reach. 




Nightland Colouring Book consists of twenty images (that can be coloured) and a story that goes with them. The originals of the illustrations are my ink drawings and I am also responsible for the concept of the book. The text has been co-written with Lemmit Kaplinski, a steampunk wizard and saviour of the art of printing. Translation assistance was given by Diana Norma Szokolyai, a poet and performance artist from NYC.


Nightland Colouring book has already been published in Estonian and has proven itself to work for many people of different age groups. Its Estonian version also already has a small international following.

Who am I?
I am Ellom, a writer and illustrator from Tartu, Estonia. My first passion is poetry and poetic collaboration but I have also worked with children's books for some time, published three books for young children in Estonia and illustrated a collection of Saami fairy-tales. I come from a literary background, have studied both folklore and linguistics and have years of experience working with the very young. And I am a mother. 
Why this way?
My publishers in Estonia have found their true passion and decided to become a printing museum. I fully support them in that endeavour (and recommend to visit them in Tartu!) but that means I am on my own when looking for a way to make Nightland Colouring Book available internationally. I have all the rights to my work (and agreements with collaborators) so I am also free to do what I want with it.
Making the book available in English is a natural development - as much as Nightland Colouring Book draws inspiration from traditional cultures and the place where I was born, my community of friends and work-partners is very much international. This book is for that community. For those I know and who are already fans of the book and for those out there whom I don't know but who have been longing for this kind of vision or feel they click with it. 
I feel crowdfunding is a very good way to reach the people whom this book might make happy. It is direct, flexible and personal. 
And exciting. 



How to support Nightland Colouring Book?
The idea of crowdfunding is simple and beautiful - if you want to see the book come to life, you can make it happen. 
By putting some money into it and by spreading the word to all you know who might be interested. 
You will also receive something, in addition to taking part in a book's creation - there are different perks, from a pdf to an original drawing. Some of them come signed and with handwritten inscriptions or are created specifically for this indiegogo project.
If you have no money to give but feel excited about the book and want to come on board, just spreading the word is really really helpful. Very much appreciated! 
Word of mouth, email, facebook, twitter . . . any environment where you like to share about this project is good. There is also the campaign video that you can link, on vimeo and on youtube.
Where will the money go?
The funds I receive will be used for the following: 
Paying to everyone involved in this project, which includes paying for a new layout for this edition.
Printing an initial run of 500 copies of Nightland Colouring Book and shipping the ordered copies.
Buying me some weeks off my day job to re-work a few of the images, organize the printing and shipping and possibly create new drawings for you. 
Indiegogo and Paypal fees.
If there should be extra funds (which would be wonderful), they will be put towards my next project - ""The Book of Animalpeople"". It will be a book comparable to Nightland Colouring Book in theme and style, but has less emphasis on colouring and more on detailed images. You can see some of the illustrations for that book, and some of my other work at ellom.net (direct link to Animalpeople illustrations here).
I have planned to get the books to you by early spring, there is reasonable hope that it will happen earlier but have to take into account possible delays at printers and, always, the unexpected. There will be updates and explanations if the schedule should change.
Thank you for stumbling here (or coming on purpose)! 
Here's to hoping we can make this happen!

<strong>So a little more </strong><strong>about this new journey</strong>
</h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>From the <strong>Transnational Black Feminist</strong> invitation letter:</p>
<p>     <em>“The purpose of the retreat is to ask the question: <strong>what does it mean to conceptualize and enact a transnational black feminist praxis?  </strong>As part of the retreat, we will visit with local organizations and with local groups of black women and black feminist activists, artists and scholars to hold conversations about this question. In addition to being part of conversations with folks here, we will have a day to retreat and to reflect, process and develop work from our experiences.  We will then have the opportunity to share our insights/analyses with a larger audience at a one-day conference, to be held at INTEC-Center for Women and Gender Studies. As part of participating in the Retreat, we would collectively form a presentation shaped by our conversations and experiences from the week.  The idea is to assess the current dynamics of the playing field while also fostering intentional and deep conversation about black feminist praxis in and between the Global South and the Global North.”</em></p>

<strong>¿</strong><strong>el impacto?</strong>
</h2>
<p>I really cannot express how badly I want to attend this gathering. With this call I have the chance to reach out and expand my awareness of the African Diaspora in the Dominican Republic. I have an opportunity to work with other women whose work shares some commonality to my own. It will help me focus on the larger themes present in my project <a href=""http://latashanevadadiggs.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><em>Un Momento</em></a>; gender, race, identity, history, landscape.  Participating at the <strong>Black Feminism Retreat/Conference</strong> could also lead to additional engagements and creative collaborations. Above all, I desperately need to attend this conference. I want to be shaped by what I will learn in discussion with those invited. I want it to shape my project and my creative process in ways I can only imagine. I want to become a stronger woman, artist, and organizer. I simply don’t want to miss out on something that could help my understanding of feminist studies in the Americas.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Before the journey </strong></h2>
<p>In July of 2010, I traveled to Peru to do research for a series of poems, songs, and meditations entitled “<a href=""http://latashanevadadiggs.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Un Momentu</a>.”  The project’s central figure is Micaela Bastidas, the revolutionary martyr and wife of rebel leader Tupac Amaru.  During my research, I have discovered a handful of documents that describe Bastidas as being of African and Andean mixture. This is what initially sparked my curiosity and how I came to spend six weeks traveling to various parts of Peru. The project looks at ethnic identity during Colonial Peru, the relationships between Africans, Free Blacks and Andeans. It takes into question, what life was for Bastidas as an Afro-Peruana and if she “passed” given the time. In this portion of the work, I am examining the imagined and the factual. The project also looks at identity within contemporary visual arts and how it is capitalized upon or not in the art world.</p>
<p><br/> My six weeks in Peru was life changing and left me with a lot of material and the desire to return to continue my research so that I may tell Micaela’s story and that of the women of Peru who talked to me in the streets in Lima, in small local restaurants in Cuzco, in their homes in EL Carmen and Arequipa, and on a boat upon Lake Titicaca.  But while the date to return to Peru is pending, I now have once in a lifetime occasion to learn about women and the role of black feminism in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<h2><strong>¿por que?</strong></h2>
<p>You may be asking yourself, what does this have to do with Peru?   This event, the first of its kind in Dominican Republic will be held <strong>this year</strong> from <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">March 10 to March 17</span>.</strong>  It invites a small group of women from Latin America, the Caribbean and North America. I cannot explain how much I am honored to be one of the women invited.  I cannot explain how much this is a historical undertaking.  While the organizers cannot pay my airfare or provide a per diem, the registration fee (dirt cheap) covers all lodging, meals (lunch and dinner), ground transportation to and from workshops, talks, historical tours AND a translator.  This is not something to be taken for granted.  They understand the importance of making connections and not wanting the interference of US funding mechanisms.  They know that the women invited represent of range of artists, scholars, activists, and writers who in and outside of the academic field.  This is a grassroots effort.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>comida buena <strong>y cariño</strong></strong></h2>
<p>If you know me, I love creating artifacts/gifts/tokens that both represent my gratitude and desire to make folks warm and fuzzy.  Anything from cupcakes to flan to lemon tarts to posters.  For your contribution you’ll receive:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Postcards from the Dominican Republic (I will write you personally a little note about my week there),</li>
<li>Limited edition reprints of chapbooks published between 1996 and 2011</li>
<li>One of a kind, handmade single strand beaded necklaces (made with a combination of glass, seed and metal beads, and bone...no two are alike!)</li>
<li>A once in a lifetime music track (only three will be offered) created just for YOU!</li>
<li>If you’re a lover of words and moving image, a 3-minute text-video piece especially made for YOU (Limit 2). If you’re curious about the videos I've created in the past for performances at MoMA PS1 and Brooklyn Museum, you can check them out <a href=""http://vimeo.com/21577273"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a>. </li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>As a curator and artistic director, I’ve co-presented many events in New York City, largely focused on poetry and music. I’ve been very fortunate to co-present these events at venues like El Museo del Barrio, Lincoln Center Out of Doors, Bowery Poetry Club, the Schomburg Center for Black Culture and BAM Cafe.  One of the most rewarding things about the events, concerts, and readings I’ve presented is highlighting women artists, musicians, poets — young and old — in life and in craft. I find this kind of work is part of my role as a woman artist.  While I work hard to improve my own creative work, I must, when given the opportunity, support other women.  I also enjoy giving younger women the opportunity to learn the ins and outs of producing a show. For me, it’s just as important to know how to produce an event as it is to be a seasoned artist.  In the end, it makes me feel pretty darn good to see other women artists succeed, to be introduced to different audiences, to be given a chance. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>
<strong>¿</strong>no dinero? ok you're broke</h2>
<p>I understand that many folks simply don't have the funds and won't be able to contribute, that it's a seriously bad time and may want to help in other ways. One way you can is by getting the word out and channeling that wonderful shampoo commercial of the past.   Please share with folks you know who may share the same interests I have.  Share it with folks who just like supporting artists and their ventures.  Write a note to someone about my project. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So there it is in a nutshell.  By helping me attend this conference in the Dominican Republic, you’re becoming a supporter, a benefactor, a long lost auntie, uncle, cousin, older sibling who believes in my work and its role in the larger conversation surrounding women in the arts.   Thank you all for checking out my campaign and I sincerely hope I’ll be able to bless your mailbox with goodies of thanks. </p>

<h3>A short synopsis on my book project.</h3>
<p>In the winter of 2011, I decided to see a therapist about a childhood trauma that I had been dealing with for a long time. My husband Kyle referred me to therapist and three days later I was sitting on his couch. Like many people, I didn't think that therapy was for me, and so I was skeptical when I arrived. Five minutes into our meeting, I knew I had come to the right place, and would finally be getting the help that I had needed for thirty years. Dr. Harrison turned out to be the complete package. He was also an ordained minister which worked great for me. I needed spiritual healing as well.</p>
<p>I had about four or five more much needed sessions with Dr. Harrison. During our last session we spoke about forgiveness. Like many people who have been wronged, and have been carrying anger for a long time, I wasn't sure I was ready to deal with forgiveness. I am being honest when I say that this was probably the most difficult session I had with the good therapist. Up until that point, I was one of those people who thought that as long as I was harboring un-forgiveness in my heart, the person towards whom my anger was being directed was being punished. It gave me some sort of power over them that made me feel better- plain and simple. I was happy to carry that un-forgiveness for as long as I could .</p>
<p>He said that because I had told him that I was a practicing Christian, I had to recognize that God loves everyone, is in everyone and everything. One cannot say that they love God and not love their neighbor including those that hate and hurt us. I have to tell you this is one aspect of Christianity that has always been hard for me to swallow, and I shared that with him. How can I possibly love somebody who did something so vile to me?  I knew that he could tell what I was thinking, because he gave me that look as though to say-wait a minute, I am going somewhere with this. He said that as difficult as it may seem, I had to understand that everything that happens in our lives, is meant to prepare us to fulfill the true purpose of our lives. People come into our lives, regardless of their intentions to arm us with the tools to deal with life’s constant and never ending trials and tribulations. Everybody that touches our lives leaves an imprint and all these imprints form a tapestry of experience that requires both the good and bad to help us build strength, endurance, wisdom, empathy, Grace and ultimately character.</p>
<p>“Consider yourself fortunate when all kinds of trails come your way""he sais, for you know that when your faith succeeds in facing such trails, the result if the ability to endure”, he quoted from the bible book of James. ”You have to let it go”, he said.” “That anger is taking up space in your heart that you could replace with things that would allow you to live your best life. You are not the one that committed the crime, why are you the one serving the sentence?” This question was so profound; it rendered my stubborn mind silent and slowly my spirit was starting to receive the message.</p>
<p>The he shred with me  the Old Testament bible story of how Joseph had been sold into slavery by his brothers. As the story goes, after initially facing numerous hardship during his years of servitude, Joseph become governor of Egypt and in spite of everything invited his brothers and Father to live with him and share in his good fortune. When their father Jacob died, the brothers became afraid that Joseph would take revenge for what they had done to him. So they sent a message to him saying that it was their father's dying wish that he forgive them, for what they had done to him. What they didn't know is that Joseph bore no ill will and he said to them:</p>
<p><em>'You intended to harm me, but God intended it <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">all for good</span></strong>. He brought me to this position so I could save the lives of many people.' </em><em>Genesis 50.20</em></p>
<p>Everything stopped. My entire being and all my senses stood up at full attention. Then as though it had been hovering over me for a while, what I can only describe as the grace of realization and revelation softly landed and absorbed into my spirit and just like that everything made sense and for the first time in my life<strong><em>- I GOT IT. </em></strong></p>
<p>I was born to a life of priviledge in the small East African Nation of Uganda.At the age of seven and for a year after that, I was sexually abused and molested by a relative-right under my parents' nose.The abuse changed the trajectory of my life and as a result,I lived in shame and darkness for than thirty years-basically all of my life.I maintained the appearance that everything was good, but I was slowly dying and did almost die at one point.Understanding for the first time that all was not lost and that I could choose to end my pain, by refusing to look at my experience as a <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Curse</span></strong> but as a<strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> Cause</span></em></strong> ; was life altering.After finding peace of mind for the first time in my life,I knew had to find a way to make the experience worthwhile for others going through similar situations. So I decided to write a Book about my life and hopefully start of movemnt of hope for the abused and wounded,to inspire others that the choice to end their suffering is in their hands , and no one elses.</p>

<p>The issue of child abuse and child molestion has become something that in many ways we have become numb to .We hear about these cases on the news and read about them in the paper all the time,and are affected only momentarily, because we think that some one else will deal with it.One of out every three women is a victim of some sort of sexual abuse as a child or adult and the number is quickly growing for boys and men.This book however,is not just about molestation-but the overall human experience with being stuck and unable to move on.Not every one can afford a therapist or proffesional help,but if we can help eachother along,in whatever way we can, we can make a difference.That is why we survive-to help others.My intention for this book is that it the lessons therein will help set someone else free.</p>

</div></div>","A short synopsis on my book project.
In the winter of 2011, I decided to see a therapist about a childhood trauma that I had been dealing with for a long time. My husband Kyle referred me to therapist and three days later I was sitting on his couch. Like many people, I didn't think that therapy was for me, and so I was skeptical when I arrived. Five minutes into our meeting, I knew I had come to the right place, and would finally be getting the help that I had needed for thirty years. Dr. Harrison turned out to be the complete package. He was also an ordained minister which worked great for me. I needed spiritual healing as well.
I had about four or five more much needed sessions with Dr. Harrison. During our last session we spoke about forgiveness. Like many people who have been wronged, and have been carrying anger for a long time, I wasn't sure I was ready to deal with forgiveness. I am being honest when I say that this was probably the most difficult session I had with the good therapist. Up until that point, I was one of those people who thought that as long as I was harboring un-forgiveness in my heart, the person towards whom my anger was being directed was being punished. It gave me some sort of power over them that made me feel better- plain and simple. I was happy to carry that un-forgiveness for as long as I could .
He said that because I had told him that I was a practicing Christian, I had to recognize that God loves everyone, is in everyone and everything. One cannot say that they love God and not love their neighbor including those that hate and hurt us. I have to tell you this is one aspect of Christianity that has always been hard for me to swallow, and I shared that with him. How can I possibly love somebody who did something so vile to me?  I knew that he could tell what I was thinking, because he gave me that look as though to say-wait a minute, I am going somewhere with this. He said that as difficult as it may seem, I had to understand that everything that happens in our lives, is meant to prepare us to fulfill the true purpose of our lives. People come into our lives, regardless of their intentions to arm us with the tools to deal with life’s constant and never ending trials and tribulations. Everybody that touches our lives leaves an imprint and all these imprints form a tapestry of experience that requires both the good and bad to help us build strength, endurance, wisdom, empathy, Grace and ultimately character.
“Consider yourself fortunate when all kinds of trails come your way""he sais, for you know that when your faith succeeds in facing such trails, the result if the ability to endure”, he quoted from the bible book of James. ”You have to let it go”, he said.” “That anger is taking up space in your heart that you could replace with things that would allow you to live your best life. You are not the one that committed the crime, why are you the one serving the sentence?” This question was so profound; it rendered my stubborn mind silent and slowly my spirit was starting to receive the message.
The he shred with me  the Old Testament bible story of how Joseph had been sold into slavery by his brothers. As the story goes, after initially facing numerous hardship during his years of servitude, Joseph become governor of Egypt and in spite of everything invited his brothers and Father to live with him and share in his good fortune. When their father Jacob died, the brothers became afraid that Joseph would take revenge for what they had done to him. So they sent a message to him saying that it was their father's dying wish that he forgive them, for what they had done to him. What they didn't know is that Joseph bore no ill will and he said to them:
'You intended to harm me, but God intended it all for good. He brought me to this position so I could save the lives of many people.' Genesis 50.20
Everything stopped. My entire being and all my senses stood up at full attention. Then as though it had been hovering over me for a while, what I can only describe as the grace of realization and revelation softly landed and absorbed into my spirit and just like that everything made sense and for the first time in my life- I GOT IT. 
I was born to a life of priviledge in the small East African Nation of Uganda.At the age of seven and for a year after that, I was sexually abused and molested by a relative-right under my parents' nose.The abuse changed the trajectory of my life and as a result,I lived in shame and darkness for than thirty years-basically all of my life.I maintained the appearance that everything was good, but I was slowly dying and did almost die at one point.Understanding for the first time that all was not lost and that I could choose to end my pain, by refusing to look at my experience as a Curse but as a Cause ; was life altering.After finding peace of mind for the first time in my life,I knew had to find a way to make the experience worthwhile for others going through similar situations. So I decided to write a Book about my life and hopefully start of movemnt of hope for the abused and wounded,to inspire others that the choice to end their suffering is in their hands , and no one elses.
Why an Indiegogo campaign?

The tenatative book release date for this book is September 10th ,2012 ,but before this release date there is still alot of strings that need to be tied up.To produce a quality product ,I need quality logistics that come with quality pricing.In order to get this book into the market place I need approximately $12,000:

I need to pay publishing costs
I need to hire an editor for final draft revision
I need to hire a PR firm to handle the marketing because this is an important  message that I intend to spread effecetively far and wide.

*What happens if I raise money over and above the goal? I will use that to fascilitate travel to speaking engagements and workshops that I intend to hold to further tell my story.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Mindfulness is defined as non-judgmental present moment awareness. Most people think that mindfulness meditation can only happen while seated in one position for extended periods of time in order to cultivate the inner quietude necessary for reducing stress and alleviating suffering.<br/><br/>I have discovered is that mindfulness meditation can be achieved in almost any activity that fully engages the senses and<span class=""text_exposed_show""> brings awareness to what is happening in the body. When we become aware of body sensations, we are brought into the present moment. The mind lives in the past and the present. The body is here, now. <br/><br/>This project is dedicated to my exploration of unconventional paths to mindfulness by interviewing real people. What I have found, and continue to find, is that there are some pretty mindful people around here who didn't even know they were meditating.<br/><br/><strong>About the author</strong>: Kristy Harvey is a Movement Educator from Charlottesville, VA. She is the former Administrative Director of the Mindfulness Center at the University of Virginia. She is a licensed Nia Instructor and a certified Yoga instructor. She is currently working on a clinical trial, for which she wrote the protocol, at UVA to study the effect of the Nia technique on the quality of life among women treated for breast cancer. She also offers free Restorative Yoga classes for women who have been treated for breast cancer at UVA. She has been an invited speaker for many presentations about Mindful Movement at UVA and around the Charlottesville Community. Recently, she was the keynote speaker at the Healthy Nurse Conference in Charleston, WV. Kristy will be relocating to Tucson, AZ this Fall where she will open a wellness center focusing on Mindful Movement.  When she is not teaching Nia or Yoga, she is writing and laughing (a lot).</span></p>

<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>After managing the Mindfulness Center at UVA for several years, Kristy observed that while many people desperately needed the life maintenance skills that mindfulness practice delivers, dozens did not enroll in the mindfulness classes because they were intimidated by the thought of having to sit still for extended periods of time.  Sometimes, even those who did enroll in the classes found it to be quite difficult because they were not ready to be still with their thoughts.  </p>
<p>So how do we reach those people?  How can we teach people how to connect with the present moment if they are not able to connect with their bodies?  Kristy believes that we must first help people identify how they might already be connecting with the present moment, but they may not be aware of it.  And so, Mindfulness On the Move was born!  </p>
<p>As a Movement Educator, Kristy has been teaching Mindful Movement for the past 6 years.  It is through dance that she became aware of her own body sensations and therefore has been able to cultivate the mindfulness skills that help her manage stress. She is currently studying the effect of Nia (dance, martial arts &amp; yoga) on the quality of life among women who have been treated for breast cancer through a clinical trial at the University of Virginia.  Kristy is so passionate about helping others achieve healing awareness through movement that she quit her job at the UVA Mindfulness Center in order to connect with people on a more personal level.  </p>
<p>This project will help people connect with mindfulness in ways they did not even know were possible.  Kristy is meeting with people who have unique ways of cultivating mindfulness without having a formal meditation practice.  So far, she has talked with a distance runner, a musician, a yoga instructor, and an artist.  The goal is to tell the stories of how real people have found mindfulness practice and compile them into a book that will offer 52 unique paths to mindfulness.  The blog is up and running at <a href=""http://www.mindfulnessonthemove.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.mindfulnessonthemove.com</a>. </p>
<p>The funding for this project will go towards travel expenses, website maintenance, internet service fees, production assistance, advertising, and other expenses.  There are also plans to develop a radio show that will explore this topic in depth and give people an opportunity to tell their own stories and have the audience interact with them.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will help us reach even more people.  If you have ever experienced a stressful situation in your life, you know how difficult it can be to maintain clarity in order to make good decisions.  Mindfulness is a skill that can help train the brain to consciously respond to rather than react to stressful situations.  Kristy is on a mission to make mindfulness skills available to everyone.  You don't have to be a monk living in silence for years to experience peace.  You can experience peace in this moment, right here, right now.  We can help show you how.  </p>

cancer take the life of one of the bravest women I knew. As her time drew near,
her thoughts were fixed on her two young daughters. I wrote ""I Will Love

practical, everyday places (a sibling's smile, the smell of Sunday pancakes,
the taste of snow cream, or a hug from grandpa) to feel the enduring presence
of loved ones who have transitioned. </span><span style='font-family: ""Times New Roman""; color: #4D4D4D;'></span></p><p></p><p></p>

upon losing my grandmother when I was a child. My mouth knew to say that she
lived up with God and not in her body, but my heart didn't really understand.
As nice as heaven seemed, it sounded desperately far away. How would she hold
my hand in the Big Star Grocery Store from way up there or kiss my boo boos to
make them feel better? How could she still be mine to love and be loved by if
she was no longer mine to touch? These are the types of questions that five-year-old
Hope wrestles with in ""I Will Love You Everywhere Always.” It is a
book I would have appreciated receiving when my grandmom passed away and speaks
to the places I learned to find her each time I missed her.</span><span style='font-family: ""Times New Roman""; color: #4D4D4D;'></span></p><p></p><p></p>

Story
My name is Renee Alexander Craft. In 2008, I watched breast
cancer take the life of one of the bravest women I knew. As her time drew near,
her thoughts were fixed on her two young daughters. I wrote ""I Will Love
You Everywhere Always"" to help her daughters and other young people learn
practical, everyday places (a sibling's smile, the smell of Sunday pancakes,
the taste of snow cream, or a hug from grandpa) to feel the enduring presence
of loved ones who have transitioned. 
 
In writing this book, I remembered how sad and confused I felt
upon losing my grandmother when I was a child. My mouth knew to say that she
lived up with God and not in her body, but my heart didn't really understand.
As nice as heaven seemed, it sounded desperately far away. How would she hold
my hand in the Big Star Grocery Store from way up there or kiss my boo boos to
make them feel better? How could she still be mine to love and be loved by if
she was no longer mine to touch? These are the types of questions that five-year-old
Hope wrestles with in ""I Will Love You Everywhere Always.” It is a
book I would have appreciated receiving when my grandmom passed away and speaks
to the places I learned to find her each time I missed her.
 
The Impact
I have teamed up with award-winning visual artist Cosmo Whyte
(http://www.cosmowhyte.com) to create what I hope will be both a useful tool
and a beautiful keepsake.  The completed book will be a 40 page full-color
8x8 picture book with text simple enough for young readers to comprehend.
 
It is intended not only as a comforting reminder that the ones
we love never truly leave us, but also as a means to help children talk about
their feelings and fears surrounding death. Likewise, it gives caregivers
another resource to guide little people through the process of loss and healing.
 
I plan to distribute the book to schools, hospitals, hospice,
counseling centers, and organizations that offer support services to those
dealing with terminal illness as well as through traditional booksellers.

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>La copia de Van Gogh</strong> destaca por su lenguaje sencillo, fresco, lleno de matices y directo, en una historia que nos permite vivir los acontecimientos casi como si fuésemos los protagonistas.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>La Copia de Van Gogh</strong> es la historia de la amistad entre Miriam, una chica barcelonesa de clase media y familia católica tradicional, y Helena, una chica americana que emigra a España al principio de los años 80 con sus padres liberales y abiertos. La historia comienza cuando siendo las dos niñas, se conocen durante unas vacaciones en la isla de Mallorca. Sus orígenes y biografías tan distintas hacen que se sientan inmediatamente atraídas, forjando una estrecha relación que se fortalece en sucesivos veraneos. Sin embargo, cuando la desgracia se cierne sobre ellas, la amistad se rompe, y cada una sigue un camino diferente. Miriam llevará una existencia gris sometida a las expectativas familiares, mientras que Helena viaja a la India en busca de una hermana desaparecida. Años después, Helena desaparece también en Nueva York cuando volvía de la India, y Miriam decide ir en su busca. El rescate de la amiga, acaba convirtiéndose en un encuentro consigo misma que cambiará su vida definitivamente.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">La novela  combina múltiples elementos: la nostalgia de la infancia perdida, el exotismo de la India y de los pueblos marineros de la costa de Nueva Jersey, la intriga de un sucio asunto de adopciones falsas, la aventura de la búsqueda de la amiga desaparecida, los amores románticos de sus protagonistas, la casi obsesiva atracción por el mar, y avanzando entre medio de todos esos temas, la constante evolución de la protagonista Miriam.</p>

<h2>Let me tell you how (français plus bas)</h2>
<p>My name is Theodore Bauthier, and I am 19. Last year I was part of YIP (the Youth Initiative Program), an international study program based in Sweden, on social entrepreneurship, aiming to strengthen young people’s capacity to take initiative, in the face of the global and current challenges.</p>
<p>During that year, in December 2015, I went on a two month internship to Los Angeles, the city of angels. There I was introduced to a number of very inspiring social organisations and projects doing beautiful work in the city. I wanted to know more about the organisations and their work, but most of all I was really interested in the people behind them, wanting to understand and learn from the stories and experiences of those social entrepreneurs. And so I decided to go to those organisations and interview them, have a conversation, collect words and learn from those doers. </p>
<p>My experience in L.A, just like this whole year, has been a very rich one for me, and part of why is because of meeting so many people that inspired me deeply. Those people committed to the ""better"", change makers that act on what they believe and do. I was and still am very interested in this amazing art that is taking initiative, in this beautiful energy that is doing. </p>
<h3>The depth of the experience and the words collected, quickly made the idea of sharing it and making a book of it emerge. And here we are now. AngelsWords, in a collection of conversations and photography from my dear friend Tom Schaefer, is a book/magazine which tells the stories and experiences of those people who DO.</h3>
<p>My interest for journalism only grows, as I disagree more and more with our current way of using and spreading information. AngelsWord is a learning journey, a first fruit in just the very beginning of an exploration of what a better journalism could look like…</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Where is AngelsWord at? </h2>
<p>I have been working on AngelsWord for a bit more then a year now. As it is the first time I am doing anything like it, I have been learning a lot on each step of the process, and it's been an amazing experience. And here we are on the very last steps of quite a journey. I am now part of an artist studio in Brussels, where I work together with a friend/graphic designer on the layout and the form of the book that AngelsWord is to become very soon. </p>

</div></div>","Let me tell you how (français plus bas)
My name is Theodore Bauthier, and I am 19. Last year I was part of YIP (the Youth Initiative Program), an international study program based in Sweden, on social entrepreneurship, aiming to strengthen young people’s capacity to take initiative, in the face of the global and current challenges.
During that year, in December 2015, I went on a two month internship to Los Angeles, the city of angels. There I was introduced to a number of very inspiring social organisations and projects doing beautiful work in the city. I wanted to know more about the organisations and their work, but most of all I was really interested in the people behind them, wanting to understand and learn from the stories and experiences of those social entrepreneurs. And so I decided to go to those organisations and interview them, have a conversation, collect words and learn from those doers. 
My experience in L.A, just like this whole year, has been a very rich one for me, and part of why is because of meeting so many people that inspired me deeply. Those people committed to the ""better"", change makers that act on what they believe and do. I was and still am very interested in this amazing art that is taking initiative, in this beautiful energy that is doing. 
The depth of the experience and the words collected, quickly made the idea of sharing it and making a book of it emerge. And here we are now. AngelsWords, in a collection of conversations and photography from my dear friend Tom Schaefer, is a book/magazine which tells the stories and experiences of those people who DO.
My interest for journalism only grows, as I disagree more and more with our current way of using and spreading information. AngelsWord is a learning journey, a first fruit in just the very beginning of an exploration of what a better journalism could look like…

Where is AngelsWord at? 
I have been working on AngelsWord for a bit more then a year now. As it is the first time I am doing anything like it, I have been learning a lot on each step of the process, and it's been an amazing experience. And here we are on the very last steps of quite a journey. I am now part of an artist studio in Brussels, where I work together with a friend/graphic designer on the layout and the form of the book that AngelsWord is to become very soon.

<p><b><u>About Me</u></b></p>
<p>My name is Peggy Neuman. I am an artist, published poet,
writer, storyteller, lyricist, art teacher, philosopher, connector, and
observer and explorer of life! </p>
<p>I am an almost 67 year old (young!) single woman with a big Dream
and a little Pug. I, like so many, have allowed my Dreams to be put on hold, having lived these past few changing years in
financial challenges. I live on my small
Social Security check and supplement that with babysitting some wonderful 
children, but it is difficult, physically, for me most days. I pay the
important bills, but the challenges limit my creative spirit.</p>
<p>I am now at another big crossroads in my life. I can
continue to “stay” in this contained space, (no! no! no!) or be courageous,
once again, and drive “off the cliff”, (no worry, my car, Ruby, has wings!) and
my greatest “leap of faith”, by myself (of course, with my Pug-Love, Kobi), and
break free of any fears, to embark on this next leg of the trip and live an
inspired and fully creative Soul-life.</p>
<p>I intend to be on the road from 3-12 months.<br/></p>
<p>I have been preparing
for this for over a year (a lifetime actually!)…getting rid of and letting go
of most of my stuff, moving to a very small attic apartment, and continuing
this process, in preparation to travel and write and paint unencumbered. </p>
<p>I have made the commitment! </p>
<p>Like everyone, I have experienced the amazing joys of life
and the extreme challenges along my journey. </p>
<p>I have graduated from survivor to thriver!</p>
<p>It is now time for me to pursue my dream of writing about
this journey and to share it with my readers! And there is a deep knowing that
this is not my last and only Story.</p>
<p>I have, since childhood, lived with Multiple Chemical
Sensitivity, Environmental Illness, Auto-Immune Disorders, Early-Onset
Arthritis, and severe feet problems. (thus, the difficulty keeping up with and
lifting the little ones I babysit). This limits what I eat, where I go, where
and how I live, as I spend time maneuvering this world!  I do so in consciousness. So my life, now, is
very simply-lived. This being said, I create and focus on HOW I live…in daily
gratitude, creativity, (when I can) and in joy, and sharing it with others.
Where I feel my best is in my car, a controlled environment for me, and in
Nature…breathing in good air and beauty. </p>
<p>My writing stems from the view of an artistic and sensitive Soul
and spirit….how I feel comfort in the pain, see beauty in all, growth in the
dark, and joy in the small places, that brings inspiration and Enlightenment.</p>
<p>My “roadmap” is unfolding…nothing more needed for the
realization of my Vision now…except for the availability of Funds to make this
happen!</p>

spirit and soul. I will suggest some solutions and ideas on how to fully live
in intention and consciousness as an individual and how, as a species, we must
take on the responsibility that it entails, and hopefully inspire my readers in

My Vision (Plan):
 1st & 2nd Leg     (approx. 3-12 months)

2 Books:  (1st 2 as a series)
#1  “My Life As a Roadtrip  (And Oh, What a Trip It Has Been!”)…(working
title)
This covers my first 67 years, the
first 4 Crossroads reached, maneuvered, with lessons learned, wisdom
gained, lessons to share.
  #2  “My
Life As a Roadtrip II  (Driving/Diving
Into the Unknown)…(working title)
This book is a continuation,
written, literally, along my 6 months to 1 year journey from this Crossroads at
which I now stand, in 2015.  It is
written from immediate experience, observing and implementing what I have
learned and gained from the first 4 Crossroads.
  
  Each
book will be my story, the detours, open roads, crossroads, signs, the
circuitous routes, both in reality, and metaphorically and Spiritually. Each
book will be filled with insight, humor, musings and philosophies, stories,
prose, my poetry, my lyrics, my paintings, the music and others words that
inspire me, sketches, and photos.The books will be Inspiration, uplifting reads that encourage and guide others to be their most magnificent selves, no matter at what age.
  
The 3rd Leg:
Because I believe so strongly in conscious and intentional
living, and because of my own journey of chemical and toxin sensitivity, and
love of Nature, one of my passions is being actively involved in Environmental
and Ecological causes and solutions. Therefore, it is my intention, as part of
my Plan, in this next year of being on the road, to explore, discover, connect
with those who are already active in the Environmental arena, interview, and participate on a first-hand basis just where
the greatest needs are here in the US, then globally.

 That takes us into part 3
of my Plan.
4th Leg

Book 3:  
This book, based on the 3rd Leg of my journey, as envisioned at this point, will be about our
Planet Earth, with information I have researched, experienced, and discovered, then
guiding the readers to where the greatest needs are for help. I will be writing
about correlations of the Earth to our human body, on levels of body, mind,

in intention and consciousness as an individual and how, as a species, we must
take on the responsibility that it entails, and hopefully inspire my readers in

To help make this happen, I need Funding to cover costs (up to a year):
 *Alloting TIME for traveling (coast to coast), writing, editing, interviewing

*Accomodations, as needed (will stay with friends and family when possible)
*Food

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Triángulo equilátero</strong> es una de esas novelas que aportan un soplo de aire fresco a la narrativa de género... </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Un hombre acuciado por el pasado es incapaz de sobrevivir al presente. No duda para ello en inventar una vida que no es ni real ni mejor que la vivida años antes. Todo impostura. La huida a ninguna parte. <i>Triángulo equilátero</i>, la primera novela en solitario de Jesús Valbuena Blanco, es un thriller psicológico que transcurre en la mente atormentada del protagonista, obligado siempre a elegir entre el deseo y el deber, acosado por las dudas, la violencia, el amor y la nostalgia de un tiempo fallido.</p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia </strong>es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de publicar obras poco convencionales pero de indudable calidad, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para promocionar cada título cuando esta todavía se encuentra en proceso de edición.</p>
<p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p>
<p>Hoy te presentamos a <strong>Jesús Valbuena</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Lleva ya casi dos décadas ejerciendo el periodismo en todos sus formatos: prensa escrita, agencias, radio y gabinetes. Su debut editorial se produjo con la publicación de <i>El último duelo</i> (2014), un libro de relatos que tuvo una excelente acogida entre el público y la crítica. Es coautor, junto con Luis M. Moreno, de otras dos novelas: <i>Héroes de papel</i> (Premio de Narrativa del IX Certamen de Creadores por la Libertad y la Paz en Sevilla) y <i>Semillas de ceniza</i> (Tandaia, 2016).  <i>Triángulo equilátero</i> es su primera novela en solitario.</p>
<h3>¿Por qué?</h3>
<p>Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«Afuera, en la calle, se advierte también el llanto del cielo. La lluvia golpea el asfalto y los cristales y provoca un tintineo inquietante cuando las gotas chocan contras la rejas metálicas de la ventana. El cielo parece desmoronarse sobre el asfalto. Como si el mundo que hemos conocido hasta ahora tocara a su fin. Y mucho me temo que será así. Noto tu respiración entrecortada y como tus mejillas humedecen mi hombro desnudo. Estamos desnudos, sí. Desnudos, abrazados y llorando. Una luz blanca nos ilumina, tanto que la estancia parece una habitación de hospital. Hace frío. Esta casa siempre ha sido fría. Fría y húmeda. Noto que me ahogo, que me falta el aire, y que por fin se abren los pulmones cuando un nuevo río de lágrimas logra desbordar mis ojos y arrecia con fuerza sobre tu piel desnuda, gélida, dócil. Una sombra de mujer cruza la ventana. Lleva paraguas y cazadora. La veo por encima de tu hombro, empañada por las lágrimas y las gotas que inundan el cristal de la ventana. Después pasa un taxi, veloz. Y un autobús urbano. Y luego un coche. Y luego otro. Extiendo por fin la mano y acaricio el sofá hasta que agarro el revólver. Está tan frío que logra erizarme la piel».</p>
<h3>¿Cómo?</h3>
<p>Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 840€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.</li>
<li>Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.</li>
<li>Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><u>Aviso para navegantes</u>: La opción BACK IT es únicamente para realizar donaciones a la edición, por lo que no habrá comunicaciones posteriores en busca de datos de envío... cualquiera de las opciones válidas de reserva exige cumplimentar formulario para poder servir el pedido.</i></p>
<h3>Además...</h3>
<p>Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y <strong>Jesús Valbuena</strong> vea publicada su obra.</p>
<p>Gracias por vuestro tiempo.</p>

De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.
Hoy te presentamos a Jesús Valbuena.
Lleva ya casi dos décadas ejerciendo el periodismo en todos sus formatos: prensa escrita, agencias, radio y gabinetes. Su debut editorial se produjo con la publicación de El último duelo (2014), un libro de relatos que tuvo una excelente acogida entre el público y la crítica. Es coautor, junto con Luis M. Moreno, de otras dos novelas: Héroes de papel (Premio de Narrativa del IX Certamen de Creadores por la Libertad y la Paz en Sevilla) y Semillas de ceniza (Tandaia, 2016).  Triángulo equilátero es su primera novela en solitario.
¿Por qué?
Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:
«Afuera, en la calle, se advierte también el llanto del cielo. La lluvia golpea el asfalto y los cristales y provoca un tintineo inquietante cuando las gotas chocan contras la rejas metálicas de la ventana. El cielo parece desmoronarse sobre el asfalto. Como si el mundo que hemos conocido hasta ahora tocara a su fin. Y mucho me temo que será así. Noto tu respiración entrecortada y como tus mejillas humedecen mi hombro desnudo. Estamos desnudos, sí. Desnudos, abrazados y llorando. Una luz blanca nos ilumina, tanto que la estancia parece una habitación de hospital. Hace frío. Esta casa siempre ha sido fría. Fría y húmeda. Noto que me ahogo, que me falta el aire, y que por fin se abren los pulmones cuando un nuevo río de lágrimas logra desbordar mis ojos y arrecia con fuerza sobre tu piel desnuda, gélida, dócil. Una sombra de mujer cruza la ventana. Lleva paraguas y cazadora. La veo por encima de tu hombro, empañada por las lágrimas y las gotas que inundan el cristal de la ventana. Después pasa un taxi, veloz. Y un autobús urbano. Y luego un coche. Y luego otro. Extiendo por fin la mano y acaricio el sofá hasta que agarro el revólver. Está tan frío que logra erizarme la piel».
¿Cómo?
Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 840€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.

Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.
Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.
Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.

Aviso para navegantes: La opción BACK IT es únicamente para realizar donaciones a la edición, por lo que no habrá comunicaciones posteriores en busca de datos de envío... cualquiera de las opciones válidas de reserva exige cumplimentar formulario para poder servir el pedido.
Además...
Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y Jesús Valbuena vea publicada su obra.
Gracias por vuestro tiempo.

It also explains why consumers may feel compelled to chase such contrived surfaces, like a brand name or a logo, in the first place.<br/><br/>My name is Thomas Edralin and I am the author of “Look at Me, Everyone”, or how I like to call it, <i>LAME</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to explore my own questions and experiences when I initially engaged with streetwear and brand names. Being someone who has heard and experienced various sides of streetwear and clothing in general, I feel I can provide a unique and worthy perspective that invites you into the various stories and narratives found in <i>LAME</i>.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you can gain a unique perspective on clothing and more importantly, why a simple logo or design can be so important to many people in the end. I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for clothes themselves, something usually regarded for its functionality as opposed to luxury. Through this book, I want to help bridge the gap between those who are and those who are not interested in the streetwear industry. I believe that anyone can derive from these subcultures, whether it be drawing viable business practices or simply put, redefining a relationship with clothes themselves.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about things such as authenticity, exclusivity, and much more!

One Cool Hand is a web based company I plan to use for all releases of my current and future original content that includes novels, graphic novels, comic books, short stories, short films, original music and a podcast. The name One Cool Hand comes from my love of the 1967 classic film Cool Hand Luke. Luke Jackson, as played by Paul Newman, utters the classic line "" Sometimes nothin' can be a real cool hand "" after bluffing his way through a winning hand of Poker and telling his cellmates if you play it cool and if you believe in yourself then there's always hope. The line always stuck with me and became my own personal life motto in a lot of ways. You can have nothing, you can be on your own, you can doubt yourself and be unsure of your purpose, but no matter how many times life hits you and brings you down to your knees, as long as you keep getting up, then what did you really lose? As long as you have yourself then you're always in the fight, that being said, I've been doing all of this on my own for awhile now while living pay check to pay check and at times it can be a little overwhelming. Paying for illustrators to help with the comics and artists to design the covers for each book has caused me to take a bit of a financial hit. Don't get me wrong, I'll never give up on One Cool Hand and I'll never quit trying to make this dream a reality but I'm also smart enough to realize that I may not be able to do it all by myself, that's why I've started this campaign to humbly ask for a little push in the right direction to help fund One Cool Hand and the material I hope to release.<br/><br/><strong>                   <u>The Goal of my Campagin </u></strong><br/><br/>The amount of funding I am seeking for my Campaign is <strong>$5,000</strong> which will be centered around hiring various artists to help design book covers as well as illustrate the comics and graphic novels I've written. This is very important to me because I believe my stories would be greatly enhanced with a visual element that will help capture each reader's imagination, helping the story as it needs to be told and to be experienced at full effect for the reader. Once this is complete I will also use the remaining contributions to this campaign to help purchase the proper equipment to begin working on the podcast as well as the short films I have in pre production. These funds will be used for cameras, recording equipment, and other miscellaneous content to help grow One Cool Hand as a company. Words cannot express how grateful I would be for any assistance in helping see my vision through to it's very end. Even if you are not able to help financially, simply sharing the website for One Cool Hand and helping spread the word about my company and my content would mean the world to me. This has always been my greatest dream and your generosity and belief in my books, my films, and my voice is something I would never, ever forget. You have my word that once my books are finished and everything is complete that your money will be paid back in full. I plan on personally reaching out to every backer to keep in touch with them about what exactly their contribution has gone to and to keep them updated on their perks and when their money will be returned.</p><p><br/>Thank you for taking the time to read what I've had to say, we're all here for the same reasons, we're either creators or we wish to help creators and that alone gives us a bond.<br/><br/>With that, I leave you with the wise words of the great, Kevin Smith <br/> </p><p><i>“Remember: It costs nothing to encourage an artist, and the potential benefits are staggering.

I can truly say that I have a much better idea of who I am now.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Alexis  - I've listened to Case's podcast for over a year and I was so excited to hear he was releasing a journal.

Can’t say enough good things. Much love!!(you can check out another 2,000 five-star podcast reviews here)⚡⚡Why Does Self Awareness Matter?A note from Case:Self awareness is the most important aspect of your life and your self development! The more self aware you are, the happier, more fulfilled, driven and confident you become. I firmly believe this to be true!When you become self aware, you know yourself and you know your truth.Your truth is so much more than living a normal life. Your truth is so much more than settling for familiar, ordinary or routine. Your truth is one where you are always pushing yourself to search for what lights you up inside — people, places, interests and passions.The New Mindset Journal pushes you to discover your truth in a natural and progressive way.- Case (@case.kenny)⚡⚡Video Tour of the JournalHere's a quick video of Case taking you through the journal first-hand. Watch to learn what you can expect when you first receive your journal.⚡⚡How The Journal Came To BeEven with the effectiveness and popularity of his podcast New Mindset, Who Dis... Case had spent many years feeling lost, uninspired and disconnected from who he really was.He knew journaling had the potential to help, but he struggled to find a system that worked.Case personally tried dozens of journals focused on productivity, goal setting, checklists and diary-like activities but none led him to the clarity he needed. He knew something was missing. The journal was born from a need -  a journaling experience that focuses on the real foundation to success, happiness, wealth and confidence - SELF AWARENESS.Goal setting, daily gratitude and productivity tracking are great tools to enhance your life... but Case had learned that without self awareness, it's not very effective.So, Case created a journal focused on one thing and one thing only: asking questions and providing prompts that lead to self-awareness.Along the way, he partnered up with his business advisors and good friends - Adam Toren and Matthew Toren - to ensure he had an experienced team that could execute on the purposeful mission of creating a unique, well-manufactured and promptly shipped and delivered journal.To bring the journal to life in a colorful, well-designed way Case also partnered with talented photographer, videographer and graphic designer Justin Kamstra.Together, Case and team have created a unique, well-made and effective journal ready to ship and change your life.⚡⚡The Team Behind The JournalCase KennyCase lives in Chicago, IL and is the host of the New Mindset, Who Dis Podcast.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Help us print &amp; publish a book! It's already written - we just need your support &amp; you get a copy in return for your support!</p>
<p>We want to publish poems created from testimony of people in &amp; around Ground Zero during the 911 tragedy. Other topics of the poems include nature, community, aging, and more. </p>
<p>Matthew Ferraro is a multimedia composer and has been involved in everything from video games such as ""Medal of Honor"", the TV series ""Futurama"" and films ""The Insider"" ,"" The Incredibles"" and many more. The text that will be printed is from the libretto of the Tensions of Opposites, which was a large-scale multimedia work which opened to standing ovations at the Barbican in London in 2009. Matthew co-wrote the pieces with the poet Elin Ap Hywel and the writer Sabrina Tom. </p>
<p><strong>What is '13 Seconds and More' About?</strong></p>
<p>We are publishing poems that were created using the testimony of people in and around Ground Zero during the 911 tragedy. Three years later and five years later, Matthew returned to track down those same people to understand how they coped with tragedy and loss. It took about 13 seconds for each building to fully collapse and compress and that is why the piece is entitled ""13 Seconds.""  All the text in that poem is verbatim.</p>
<p>Other topics that the poems touch on include building community, the inter-generational divide, issues of the wealthy and the poor, and the struggle between man and nature. There are many more interviews and statements from people who have experienced these situations, ranging from Hiroshima to the financial crisis, and the statements were interwoven into mosaics of poetry and prose. The text that we are using is from the libretto of the Tensions of Opposites, which was a large-scale multimedia work which opened to standing ovations at the Barbican in London in 2009. Matthew co-wrote the pieces with the poet Elin Ap Hywel and the writer Sabrina Tom. </p>
<p>The funding will go to publishing copies of the book in printed and electronic formats, and shipping the book to us &amp; then the readers, which we hope will include you if you choose to participate. If we receive our goal of $2000, we will donate 20% of money raised to Tuesday’s Children, which is a non-profit family service organization providing support and services for the children of 9/11 and others impacted by global terrorism. The overall mission of this project is to increase awareness of the more pertinent issues affecting our society. We believe in the importance of arts and education and taking it one step further by being a solution to the problem by servicing those who are affected by tragedy.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>In order to publish the books, we have to meet a minimum order amount. It’s going to cost us at least $1000 for the absolute minimum order of printed paperback books, ISBN barcodes, and making it available online as an eBook for Kindle, Nook, etc. We plan on giving 20% of the proceeds to Tuesday’s Children. That’s $400 if we make only $2000. We estimate at least another $600 also to pay for the preparation of the graphic design cover &amp; layout of the book, boxes and postage to ship that minimum order of books to you!</p>
<p>If you donate at least $10, you will get a copy of the eBook!</p>
<p>If you donate $20, you will get a copy of the book sent to you!</p>
<p>If you donate $30, you can get an autographed copy from Matthew Ferraro!</p>
<p>If you donate $100, you can get a limited edition broadside of the poem 13 Seconds!</p>

<p>Delivered materials are contingent on the full funding of the project. </p>
<p>If we don’t reach our goal, we will try to figure out another way to move forward using what funds were donated.  </p>
<p>If we make more than just $2000, we will be able to print more books and donate more money to Tuesday’s Children. If we receive a significant amount more than needed to cover all our costs, then we will use the money to prepare the Tension of Opposites for a premiere in the United States.</p>

<h3>Complete Our Family</h3>
<p>My name is Jen and I'm 31, and on September 2, I married my soul mate, Steve, 36, and gained two amazing step-children, Stephen, 14, and Isabella, 10. The only problem is that ten years ago, Steve had a vasectomy and I have no children of my own.</p>
<p>At the time, he was married to his first wife (his kids' mother), and they had decided that two children was enough for them. Well, life goes on and they ended up divorcing. Two years later is when I met Steve. We knew right from the start that this was meant to be. We have so much in common and such similar senses of humor. I had never met anyone that I felt so much for and so comfortable with in such a short time. He was very up front with me about the vasectomy, especially given that I don't have kids. He always said that when the time comes, we have options.</p>
<p>So four years later we finally tie the knot and now we want to have a baby of our own. We have researched all of our options. We knew that having a vasectomy reversal or IVF (in vitro fertilization) was going to be very costly, and we talked to our insurance company only to find out that we don't have any kind of fertility coverage. They will cover a percentage of the office visits and that's about the extent of it. We even considered the option of artificial insemination with an annonymous donor. Steve said that he would be fine with that , that he wants me to experience being a mother and how could he expect me to love his kids the way I do and him not love another? (Not to mention, this method is substantially more affordable).</p>
<p>When we went to our initial consultation with the fertility specialist, we were let down to say the least. He said essentially, we have three options: vasectomy reversal, IVF or IUI with donor sperm. Option one, vasectomy reversal, is somewhat unrealistic. It's very expensive and given our ages and the amount of time since the vasectomy, chances are that he could be producing less healthy sperm or there could be complications or even birth defects. It could also take years for us to get pregnant, if we even do. Option two, IVF, is what he suggests. Of course it's even more expensive than we had anticipated, but it gives us about a 70% success rate, plus, the baby would be biologically both of ours. Option three, IUI, is significantly less expensive, but this also drops our success rate down to 10-15%. Also, Steve would not be the baby's biological father. And, with percentages that small, we would more than likely have to repeat this process a few times before we actually conceived.</p>
<p>IVF seemed like a no-brainer, until we started talking about prices. This method is going to cost $11,400 just for the procedure, plus $1,600 for office visits, hormone labs, medications and testing. My heart broke, it was all I could do not to break down right there in the office. I knew there was no way we could afford this right now or anytime in the forseeable future. We have less than mediocre credit and have been rejected two medical loans already. My husband and I are both in school part time and working full time. I also do cakes on the side, but we still can never seem to get ahead.</p>
<p>I always thought I was lucky in my twenties that I never had any ""accidents,"" but now I'm at the point where I want a child so desperately and it's so hard to stay positive that it'll ever happen. Among my three closest friends, they have six children and one is trying for another. I find myself almost resenting that some women can get pregnant so easily and others have to work so hard for it. I think having a baby is something that every woman should experience at least once (provided she wants children) and I feel that I am more than ready and deserving of loving and caring for a child of my own. I love my step-children very much and they are great kids. We all have so much love in our hearts and we want more than anything to share it with another child.</p>
<p>Any contributions would be greatly appreciated. We will post pictures and constant updates throughout the process to let you all know how it's going. I also know that not everyone can contribute, but if you could just get the word out and share our story, we would appreciate that also. Thank you so much just for taking the time to read our story! :)</p>

Cavers from Huntsville, Alabama discovered
Fern and the 437-foot-deep Surprise Pit in 1961 when the art of exploring
deep vertical holes in the ground was in its
infancy. Cavers used new and innovative techniques to plumb the depths of the
deepest vertical pit yet discovered in the United States. For many years, Fern
remained just a challenging vertical pit until 1968 and 1969 when 
Huntsville cavers once again made two of the most significant
discoveries in southeastern caving history. They discovered the Morgue Cave and
New Fern Cave, setting off a flurry of exploration and cave mapping in an
attempt to connect all three caves into one system. They would achieve that
goal, but the amount of effort that went into exploring the new caves was far
beyond what cavers first expected—and along the way, cavers discovered much
more cave than they ever imagined. This book describes the entire history of Fern Cave, from its discovery in 1961 to today.<br/><br/>This book will be a quality paperback book, 8 inches tall by 6.5 inches wide with excellent quality paper. There are numerous photos inside the book and they will be printed in black and white. The book is not laid out yet, but it will likely be between 300 and 350 pages. The cover will be in color and will feature about 18 images of the cave and its explorers. Visit my website for sample chapters and much more information about the book. <br/><br/>If you don't like ordering online, please contact me at pinkleyj@gmail.com to <b>pre-order a book via cash or check</b>. <br/><br/><b>NOTE</b>: For this campaign, I am not charging <b>shipping fees</b> because many people will be able to pick up the book at the NSS Convention, I can give the book to one of your friends to deliver to you, or I can deliver it to you personally. If I need to ship your book to you, <b>please either add $5 to the total amount here</b>, or I will ask that you send me $5 when the book is ready to ship to cover those costs. If you need to have the book shipped, I can let you know when the book is done how much your shipping fee will be (if applicable). <br/></span><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>I want to sell enough advance copies of the book to cover the printing costs, which are substantial. An incredibly talented graphic designer is creating the layout and cover for the book, and I hired a professional editor to make sure the book doesn't have any errors, so it will look great and will be fun to read. I'm also designing an eBook if you prefer that format. <br/><br/>By accepting pre-orders for the book, I'll have seed money to cover the costs, plus I'll have a better idea of how much interest there is in this book so I can better estimate the total number to order. To thank you for supporting this project, you'll be able to choose from a number of great incentives (see the entire list below). The book and perks will be delivered on July 14 (except for online bonus materials: those will be available immediately). <br/><br/>A percentage of the profits for this book will be split between the National Speleological Society Library and the Southeastern Cave Conservancy. <br/><br/><h3>What's So Special About Fern Cave?<br/>
</h3>Fern Cave is one of the most significant (and magnificent) caves in the southeastern US, and even the country. It's over 15 miles long, is three separate caves connected into one cave system, has fantastically beautiful formations, incredibly complicated passages, important deposits of ancient animal bones, one section of the cave is the winter home for over a million endangered gray bats, and the cave used to be one of the favorite destinations for experienced cave explorers (most of the cave is now closed to any caving--that story is included in the book). The story of how cavers discovered and explored this cave is incredible, especially since when cavers discovered Surprise Pit, modern vertical caving gear did not exist. This book also explains how the US Fish and Wildlife Service bought 4 entrances to the cave in 1981 and teamed up with cavers to responsibly manage the cave to protect both the massive cave itself and the bat colony. The story continues by explaining how that partnership has almost disappeared in the era of white-nose syndrome cave closures. This book is a tale of discovery, exploration, adventure, wonder, politics, nature, biology, science, and beauty. I hope you enjoy it. <br/><p></p><p></p><h3>The Perks</h3><p>You can see all of the extras offered on the right, and here are the some of the images you can choose from as extras. <br/></p><p><b>Map Prints:</b></p><p>This is an example of one of the map pages you can select as an perk. Steve Pitts (my husband and former Fern Cave Access Coordinator when there was access to manage) is drafting the surveyed portions of the cave from the remapping effort that started in the 1990s and has several sections at a stage that they can be distributed. Keep in mind that mapping the cave is not complete. The survey project was forced to stop in 2009 when US Fish and Wildlife Service closed the cave and we still have about 6 miles more to survey. But the 8.5 x 11 survey sections depict some of the most important areas in the cave and it's amazing to see how different passages levels overlap and intersect. The section below shows the  portions of the Gold Passage, Middle Cave, and Bottom Cave. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/472204/files/20140330193423-Jens_h9_22.jpg?1396233263"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><b>Photos by John Van Swearingen IV: </b><br/></p><p>JV Van Swearingen IV loved Fern and he loved photography.

You'll be able to select from some of the photos below, plus some others that I will post later. After this campaign is over, I'll post a wide variety of JV's photos you can choose from.

You'll find great stories written by original explorers, many wonderful color photos of people exploring Fern over the decades, and inside information from Jennifer and Steve about the history and current status of the cave.  <br/><br/><b>Lecture:</b><br/>For $150 you will receive the book, two 8x10 photos by JV Van Swearingen IV, and two map segments. Jennifer (and Steve if he's available) will also come to your club or community event to give a lecture about the history of Fern Cave, or a lecture about Fern's bats (or really, any topic related to Fern that interests you). This option is limited to locations within a 4 hour drive of the Huntsville, AL area. <br/><br/><b>Guided Tour:</b><br/>For $250 you will receive the book, two 8x10 photos by JV Van Swearingen
 IV, and two map segments. plus Jennifer and Steve will take you on a hike to the Surprise Pit entrance of Fern and describe the history of the cave and all of the entrances. This would be a perfect perk to schedule during the July NSS Convention. <br/><br/><b>Book Sponsor:</b><br/>If you want to do more to help this book make it to print, you can sign up as a sponsor. You will receive any of the above perks that you want, plus your name and a personalized message thanking you for your support will appear in the front of the book. <br/><p></p><h3>About the Author<br/>
</h3>Jennifer started exploring caves when she was a 12-year-old Girl Scout. She first visited Fern in 1989 and loved it. She started going back to the cave with various friends to attempt to learn her way around the vast maze of interconnecting rooms, canyons, pits, and passages. Along the way, she met and married Steve Pitts, and Steve taught Jennifer a lot about the cave (Steve currently knows more about Fern than pretty much anyone). Over the years, Jennifer helped map the cave, discovered an animal bone in a remote section of the cave that turned out to be a massive deposit of Pleistocene fossils (around 13,000 years old), helped JV Van Swearingen IV on numerous photography trips, and used to love taking people to simply see the wonders of this fantastic cave. In recent years, Jennifer and Steve also coordinated and conducted winter trips into the heart of the cave to look for signs of white-nose syndrome in the bat colony on behalf of the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Jennifer works as a professional writer. This is her first book. Visit Jennifer's webpage for more information about this book project, including the Table of Contents and sample chapters: <a href=""http://discoverhistorictravel.com/my-books/fern-cave/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://discoverhistorictravel.com/my-books/fern-cave/</a><br/><p></p></div>","Hi, my name is Jennifer Pinkley and I'm finishing up a book about the discovery, exploration, and history of one of the most fantastic caves in the southeastern United States: Alabama's Fern Cave.

The cover will be in color and will feature about 18 images of the cave and its explorers. Visit my website for sample chapters and much more information about the book. If you don't like ordering online, please contact me at pinkleyj@gmail.com to pre-order a book via cash or check. NOTE: For this campaign, I am not charging shipping fees because many people will be able to pick up the book at the NSS Convention, I can give the book to one of your friends to deliver to you, or I can deliver it to you personally. If I need to ship your book to you, please either add $5 to the total amount here, or I will ask that you send me $5 when the book is ready to ship to cover those costs. If you need to have the book shipped, I can let you know when the book is done how much your shipping fee will be (if applicable). What I Need & What You GetI want to sell enough advance copies of the book to cover the printing costs, which are substantial. An incredibly talented graphic designer is creating the layout and cover for the book, and I hired a professional editor to make sure the book doesn't have any errors, so it will look great and will be fun to read. I'm also designing an eBook if you prefer that format. By accepting pre-orders for the book, I'll have seed money to cover the costs, plus I'll have a better idea of how much interest there is in this book so I can better estimate the total number to order. To thank you for supporting this project, you'll be able to choose from a number of great incentives (see the entire list below). The book and perks will be delivered on July 14 (except for online bonus materials: those will be available immediately). A percentage of the profits for this book will be split between the National Speleological Society Library and the Southeastern Cave Conservancy. What's So Special About Fern Cave?
Fern Cave is one of the most significant (and magnificent) caves in the southeastern US, and even the country. It's over 15 miles long, is three separate caves connected into one cave system, has fantastically beautiful formations, incredibly complicated passages, important deposits of ancient animal bones, one section of the cave is the winter home for over a million endangered gray bats, and the cave used to be one of the favorite destinations for experienced cave explorers (most of the cave is now closed to any caving--that story is included in the book). The story of how cavers discovered and explored this cave is incredible, especially since when cavers discovered Surprise Pit, modern vertical caving gear did not exist. This book also explains how the US Fish and Wildlife Service bought 4 entrances to the cave in 1981 and teamed up with cavers to responsibly manage the cave to protect both the massive cave itself and the bat colony. The story continues by explaining how that partnership has almost disappeared in the era of white-nose syndrome cave closures. This book is a tale of discovery, exploration, adventure, wonder, politics, nature, biology, science, and beauty. I hope you enjoy it. The PerksYou can see all of the extras offered on the right, and here are the some of the images you can choose from as extras. Map Prints:This is an example of one of the map pages you can select as an perk. Steve Pitts (my husband and former Fern Cave Access Coordinator when there was access to manage) is drafting the surveyed portions of the cave from the remapping effort that started in the 1990s and has several sections at a stage that they can be distributed. Keep in mind that mapping the cave is not complete. The survey project was forced to stop in 2009 when US Fish and Wildlife Service closed the cave and we still have about 6 miles more to survey. But the 8.5 x 11 survey sections depict some of the most important areas in the cave and it's amazing to see how different passages levels overlap and intersect. The section below shows the  portions of the Gold Passage, Middle Cave, and Bottom Cave. Photos by John Van Swearingen IV: JV Van Swearingen IV loved Fern and he loved photography. He spent years photographing many areas of the cave and he left his entire photo collection to the National Speleological Society when he died in 2001. The NSS is allowing me to offer his prints as thank you gifts for this project. You'll receive a nice 8 x10 print if you choose one of the options with one of JV's photos. You'll be able to select from some of the photos below, plus some others that I will post later. After this campaign is over, I'll post a wide variety of JV's photos you can choose from. You can just let me know which one you wantThe Little Morgue Pit:Bottom Cave Stream Passage:If you love bats, Jennifer has a collection of photos from bat inventory trips in the cave that you can also choose. After this campaign is over, I'll post a several photos you can choose from. Just let me know which one you want. This is a closeup of gray bats: Bonus Materials:I couldn't fit every great story and every fantastic photograph into the book so I'm creating a password-protected site on my website with lots of extra ""bonus"" materials. You'll find great stories written by original explorers, many wonderful color photos of people exploring Fern over the decades, and inside information from Jennifer and Steve about the history and current status of the cave.  Lecture:For $150 you will receive the book, two 8x10 photos by JV Van Swearingen IV, and two map segments. Jennifer (and Steve if he's available) will also come to your club or community event to give a lecture about the history of Fern Cave, or a lecture about Fern's bats (or really, any topic related to Fern that interests you). This option is limited to locations within a 4 hour drive of the Huntsville, AL area. Guided Tour:For $250 you will receive the book, two 8x10 photos by JV Van Swearingen
 IV, and two map segments. plus Jennifer and Steve will take you on a hike to the Surprise Pit entrance of Fern and describe the history of the cave and all of the entrances. This would be a perfect perk to schedule during the July NSS Convention. Book Sponsor:If you want to do more to help this book make it to print, you can sign up as a sponsor. You will receive any of the above perks that you want, plus your name and a personalized message thanking you for your support will appear in the front of the book. About the Author
Jennifer started exploring caves when she was a 12-year-old Girl Scout. She first visited Fern in 1989 and loved it. She started going back to the cave with various friends to attempt to learn her way around the vast maze of interconnecting rooms, canyons, pits, and passages. Along the way, she met and married Steve Pitts, and Steve taught Jennifer a lot about the cave (Steve currently knows more about Fern than pretty much anyone). Over the years, Jennifer helped map the cave, discovered an animal bone in a remote section of the cave that turned out to be a massive deposit of Pleistocene fossils (around 13,000 years old), helped JV Van Swearingen IV on numerous photography trips, and used to love taking people to simply see the wonders of this fantastic cave. In recent years, Jennifer and Steve also coordinated and conducted winter trips into the heart of the cave to look for signs of white-nose syndrome in the bat colony on behalf of the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Jennifer works as a professional writer. This is her first book.

<p>Already, several hundred hours have been donated to getting this project off the ground, but we need a little help from those who write, read and support Erotica. This will be a non-profit group. </p>
<p>This Fundraising event is to raise funds for four specific goals of the Erotic Authors Guild:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cover the costs of setting up the non-profit entity which includes a $850 application fee to the IRS, state fee to Incorporate, Federal Tax ID fee and costs for legal review of incorporation documents.</li>
<li>Design and hosting  of a robust website offering a wide variety of 
resources to members of the Erotic Authors Guild including e-learning 
tools, author blog pages that allow monetization, reference resources 
such as Acronym Guides and an Erotica Specific Dictionary, Directory of 
Service Providers and many more tools and resources designed to assist 
members of the Erotic Authors Guild.</li>
<li>Pay for the cost of an attorney to write disclaimers for use at the beginning of books that will reduce liability to authors which will be for use of guild members at no cost.  Additionally, crafting of cease and desist letters for copyright infringement, plagiarism and piracy for use by guild members.</li>
<li>Start or acquire a not-for-profit Book Review web site exclusively for the erotica genre. As a
 guild non-profit site there will be no advertising on the site though 
the Guild will receive some funds through affiliate agreements for books
 purchased through the site.  This site will be unique in how it 
suggests books to readers and allows readers to filter out content that 
they are not interested in.  Additionally since users will have handles 
and we will not be automatically feeding any information to social 
networking sites, readers will have some anonymity that will encourage 
them to review books and share reading suggestions with other users on 
the site.<br/>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The goal we have set meets the bare minimum costs.  Exceeding the funding goal will mean that we are able to complete the project more quickly and offer more resources to guild members now instead of having to ramp up some of the services we plan to offer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our long term vision for the guild includes offering Medical, Dental and Life insurance plans to members at a reasonable cost using the size of the group to get group discounts.  Yearly awards event recognizing the many outstanding authors in the Erotic community and conventions.</strong></p>
<strong>
</strong><p>The formation of the guild is currently being driven by Lillian Christansen (pen name) who started publishing in 2003 in magazines and on-line.  Though Lillian continued to write Erotica she became disillusioned with the publishing industry and focused on a career in business where she became familiar with accounting,  business and employment law in both the non-profit and for profit world.  In 2012 she left the corporate world (where she worked for one of the biggest e-publishing companies) to write full time.  Her mix of creative erotic writing, fund raising and business savvy will be helpful in the startup of the Erotic Authors Guild.</p>
<p>Dylan Cross (pen name) has started several widely popular groups on Facebook to assist authors with the technical challenges of publishing and to give a marketing outlet to erotic authors.  Dylan also brings in experience with website creation and maintenance, activism as well as many published works on several different publishing platforms.</p>
<p>Several others have stepped up to participate in vetting mission statements, vision, ideology, business plans and other key elements of developing the guild.</p>
<p>Our goal is to complete the legal process to be a non-profit and have a guild website ready to launch by November 1, 2013.  The book review site is more complex and has a planned launch date of January 1, 2014.</p>
<p>Larger companies employ restrictions which adversely affect erotica.  Facebook limits the ability of Erotic Authors to advertise their author pages and books.  Blogger.com limits advertising on Adult Content blogs. Although these companies have no problem using erotica to draw traffic, they nevertheless distance themselves from the genre and force us to use other more expensive marketing options (which these companies also happen to profit from.)</p>
<p>By creating a unified entity, we will have the power of numbers to have a voice which can influence company policies, and create more opportunities for Erotic Authors.</p>
<p>The Guild will be accountable to our membership.  As a non-profit, per the state and IRS rules, there will be a board of directors, meeting minutes will be provided to the membership and reports will be provided on income and expenses. We currently plan on incorporating the non-profit in Nevada.</p>
<p>The current planned cost for full membership in the Erotic Authors Guild is $49 per year.  We know that in the first few months as we gain membership and the resources to provide more benefits and resources, those who join early are stating that they believe in the Guild and we want them to know that we believe in them so for the first three months we will offer the first years dues at $30. <br/></p>
<p>To be a full member of the guild you need to be a published author of erotica.  We will have additional membership options for aspiring authors and for those who provide services to the erotica community.<br/><br/> You don’t have to be an erotic author to donate.  If you love erotica and want to support erotic authors so you can keep reading the stories you love, we would love your support! If you want a credible site that reviews books and stories dedicated to erotica, please donate.</p>
<p>Below is the working draft of our mission statement and guiding principles.  We hope this gives a good idea of our goals and plans, unfortunately it would take novel to give all of the details for everything we are working on and planning. We do appreciate your support and our ultimate goal is to create and support Erotic Authors as a cohesive community.</p>
