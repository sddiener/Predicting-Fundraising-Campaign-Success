<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>We are a family seeking support to continue to send our
transgender child to an inclusive, safe, and loving school, and to afford this
opportunity to other trans families. The Center School in Greenfield,
Massachusetts has rallied for our family and our daughter Avery from the moment
we met.  As soon as we enrolled they took action: creating a supportive
environment that actively addressed her needs and refused to compromise her
integrity.  Avery's story inspired the school to change from gendered
bathrooms to all-gender bathrooms and focus on gender-inclusivity in their
socially responsible curriculum for students from preschool through 8th grade.
 The administrators started a ""Raising My Rainbow"" book club to
help educate parents and staff members about gender variance, brought the
author of that book, Lori Duron, to the area to present her work, attracting
over 200 people from the general public, and hired a highly reputable therapist
who specializes in gender education to train the entire staff.  All of
these efforts began within a month of Avery's enrollment without ANY pressure
or even suggestion from Avery's parents. </p>
<p><i>Due to changes in our family structure, we can no longer afford
to send our daughter to her beloved school</i>. Avery has blossomed at the
Center School and needs your support to be able to continue her education at
this progressive, social-justice school.  Although The Center School has
established a new scholarship for Avery and families like hers (what we call
trans*families), in its fledgling state, it can not yet offset Avery's tuition.
 Please help us send Avery and two other children from trans*families to
The Center School for the 2015-16 school year AND help us begin our new
venture: to find more safe schools like The Center School (and train schools
who hope to become ""safe"") for gender non-conforming children and
their families.  </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>You are probably wondering if working towards one, two or three
kids' education is the best way to spend your donation dollars. Maybe you think
you should, instead, give to a larger organization, focused on policy
change? That is certainly valuable. But, by giving to this campaign,
you are making a radical difference in an actual kid's life. <i>You</i> are
a hinge pin in this individual's development, safety and identify
formation.  In those moments when you ask yourself ""what have I done
to make a difference in this unjust world?"" you can remember that this
girl got to continue feeling good in her skin, <i>because of you</i>. That's
not only a great feeling, but it's authentic grass roots social
change in real time, in real life. </p>
<p>When you donate money to this fund, you will also receive a
gift featuring artwork from the ""The Transgender World"", a book
written by Avery or from the ""We Like You Avery"" book made by her
kindergarten/first grade class on the day she came out to them, one
year after joining this courageous community:</p>
<p>""I'm transgender!"" Avery announced last fall after the
class discussed a few books they had been reading on the subject.
 ""My parents thought I was a boy but I was a girl.""  Avery
walked around the class with photographs of herself as ""Henry"" and
answered ""questions and comments"" from teachers and peers.
 Afterwards, each member of the class responded with pictures and writing,
which were quickly compiled into a book titled ""We Like You Avery.""
 On that afternoon, Avery bounded out of her classroom, her hands full of
evidence of love and affirmation, racing to hug me and say, ""I told them
Mama!  I told them I'm transgender!!!""  She was absolutely
radiant - lighter, more free, more present than I had ever seen her before.
 The Center School joined our family's mission: to gently support her
re-birthing process by following her instinctual need to share her story.
 At age 6 Avery could finally be known as her whole true self by her
community at home and at school.  The Center School and our family are
truly raising this child together.    </p>
<p>We set our campaign goal at $42,289.00.  This represents
three tuitions to The Center School for one academic year.  We are working
to raise enough money to send Avery and two other children from trans*families
to The Center School as we believe this is the most supportive environment
available to them.  </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign you will ensure that Avery and
two other children under the age of ten are able to enjoy an elementary school
experience free of bullying, teasing, and uncomfortable scrutiny.  Three
children who know the true meaning of gender--- a spectrum that can only be
determined and described by a person's own self ---will be able to enjoy a
""rigorous education for deep thinkers and creative spirits"" (<a href=""http://centerschool.net%29/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://centerschool.net)</a> without the
burden of constantly navigating and processing spoken and unspoken gender
injustices throughout each and every school day.</p>
<p>The Center School honors and respects the true self of every
human that walks through its doors.  By donating to this fund, you will be
opening those doors for three young children who have found a way to articulate
their true gender identities.  You will be allowing more of this important
work to happen for more families at more schools as we bring our message and
success out into the the wider world.</p><p><b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Ris</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">ks &amp; Challenges</span></b></p>
<p>The Center School has recently established a scholarship to
support gender non-conforming children.  We are thrilled that Avery's
school has taken this extra step to demonstrate their commitment to an
inclusive and welcoming environment.  However, it is a new scholarship and
not yet established enough to enroll Avery in the second grade, her third year
at The Center School.  Avery's parents cannot continue to send her to her
beloved school - if we do not reach our goal she will enroll in her local
public school and leave her friends and teachers that love her so.  Avery
will have to navigate gender-restricted bathrooms and come out all over again,
a process that took her more than a year to accomplish at The Center
School. </p>
<p>At other schools, attended by other trans* and gender
non-conforming children we know (and after two years we know many!), the
responses from administrators look and sound radically different.
 ""But we have already planned our professional development days for
this year - maybe next year we can try to address gender as a topic.""
 Or ""We feel that the nurse and the classroom teacher are the only
ones who need to know (about this child's gender identity) - let's keep it
simple.""  At The Center School, Avery's identity is not seen as a
burden.  The teachers and administrators see Avery and her story as a
gift, just as our family does.  Avery provides an opportunity for a whole
school community to become more tolerant, more loving, more aware of the human
experience.  Shouldn't all schools see each child this way? </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Please share this campaign widely with your friends, family, and
colleagues.  This effort is just the beginning of a growing network of
people who believe that every child should feel safe and comfortable in their
own skin and in their own school.   Please contact us if you would like to
continue hearing about the work we are doing as we develop our new organization
- Gender Justice School Fund - connecting trans*families with safe schools and
training schools that hope to become ""safe"".  Thank you for
caring about this important work.  We are making great changes for present
and future generations!</p>

</div> <p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","Our Co-operative Responsibility:Come let's work together for the progressive future of these rural school pupils in Ghana. It is  joy to be part of the bright future of these pupils we are working to serve.
Why we launched this Campaign:70% of girls and boys in primary  schools in the north Gonja district of the northern region of Ghana in west Africa cannot read. Severe shortage of teaching and learning materials in schools have been cited as the cause. We launched this campaign in support of our foundation's Education Project dubbed ""School is Fun"" http://www.puretrustghana.org/education/ in response to an urgent call to mobilize educational resources to help overcome 
the challenge of chronic shortage of educational learning materials for pupils  in  the district. The goal of this 
project is to contribute in making School a safe, pleasant and 
productive place for pupils and teachers. 
The Situation: The month of September is the beginning of the school calendar for primary and Junior high schools in Ghana. It is a major turning point for every household- parents, children, community and school authorities.  For beginners, it marks My-First-Day at school and for continuing pupils a moment to progress on the educational ladder or remain where they are.  For Sakinatu and John, two primary school pupils in the Tarbiyat and DA primary schools respectively and their teachers in the North Gonja District of the northern region of Ghana, the challenge is whether there will be adequate supply of readers for effective teaching and learning in their school as it re-opens. Basic schools in  the district and other rural  areas of Ghana have been  grappling with the problem of  severe shortage of teaching and learning materials and poor infrastructure. Reading books for English, Environmental Studies, cultural studies, among others are in short supply in almost all schools in the district a fact confirmed by the district directorate of education. 
In the North Gonja District, pupils sit in groups with one reading 
book per group in order to learn.   Read on the poor state of education in the district; http://www.ghananewsagency.org/education/about-70-of-bece-candidates-cannot-read-66818

</h4>
<p>Véleményünk szerint <b>a jelenlegi oktatási
rendszer célja nem az, hogy bővítse a tudásunkat a világról és fejlessze a
gondolkodásunkat</b>, hanem korlátozza a tanárokat és a diákokat, s ezáltal
engedelmes embereket neveljen, akik nem képesek kiállni magukért, hanem
egyetértenek mindennel, amit a felettük állók mondanak.</p>
<p><b>Továbbá a fennálló oktatási rendszer
növeli a társadalmi különbségeket</b> a különböző társadalmi csoportok
között, ahelyett, hogy esélyegyenlőséget biztosítana a különböző családi- és
anyagi háttérrel rendelkező gyerekeknek. <b>A társadalmi és kulturális
szempontból hátrányos helyzetű diákokat nem támogatja</b>, közülük többen nem
is tudják az iskolában tölteni idejüket, mivel az iskolában hamar demotiválttá
válnak, szüleik pedig a segítségükre szorulnak a pénzkeresésében, hogy legyen
miből enniük. <b>A minőségi oktatás hiánya a munkaerőpiac legaljára
kényszeríti őket, és egyben a magas szintű munkanélküliség egyik fő okozója.</b></p>
<p><b>Szerintünk a jelenlegi helyzet
befolyásolja az egész életünket és tönkreteheti a jövőnket.</b> Rájöttünk, hogy
szükséges cselekednünk, és kiállnunk önmagunkért. Először is lehetőséget kell
adnunk diáktársainknak, hogy tisztában legyenek jogaikkal, hogy többet tudjanak
a demokráciáról és képesek legyenek cselekedni a közös érdekeikért.</p>
<p><b>Szeretnénk létrehozni egy önszerveződő
diákcsoportot, amely tagjai képesek kritikusan gondolkodni és nyomást
gyakorolni a döntéshozókra.</b> A Független Diákparlament egy diákok által
szervezett demokratikusan működő fórum. Meg akarjuk mutatni, hogy a minket
érintő kérdésekben igenis van véleményünk, és képesek vagyunk konstruktív
ötletekkel és megoldásokkal előállni.</p>
<p>Mi, a szervezők egyedülálló módon dolgoztuk ki a
teljes rendszerét egy diákparlamentnek. Hiszünk abban, hogy lépésről lépésre
haladva elérhetjük, hogy az országunk valóban demokratikusan működjön.</p>
<p><b>Minden évben internetes választásokat tartunk</b>, amelyek
során a középiskolás diákok szavazhatnak az általuk kiválasztott jelöltekre az
ország minden régiójában. A megválasztott képviselők a plenáris üléseken
személyesen, azok között pedig interneten keresztül szavazhatnak. (...)</p>
<p>Szükségünk van a segítségetekre, hogy
finanszírozhassuk a Független Diákparlamentet. Az adományozott összegből fogjuk
segíteni a vidéken élő diákok felutazását az ülésekre, meghirdetni a
kampány-időszakot és az internetes választást, továbbá eseményeket szervezni a
diákok számára és <b>létrehozni egy még jobb elektronikus választási rendszert</b>:
egy vonzó, letisztult és modern felületet, amely lehetővé teszi, hogy a diákok
titkosan szavazhassanak a nekik tetsző jelöltekre.</p>
<p><b>Már megszerveztük a Független Diákparlament első
ciklusát.</b> Szeretnénk még több emberhez eljutni olcsó, de kreatív hirdetések és
a média segítségével, valamint tájékoztatni az iskolákat a 2015/2016. tanév
elején. A hirdetés szükséges ahhoz, hogy eljuttassuk híreinket a lehető legtöbb
diákhoz. Minél több diákot tudunk bevonni a folyamatba országszerte, annál
nagyobb esélyünk van arra, hogy elérjük céljainkat.</p>
<p><b>Köszönjük Mindannyiotoknak, akik adományozásra
méltónak találjátok a projektet</b>, vagy csak végigolvastátok a leírást, mert
hisszük, hogy ha egyre többen értesülnek a helyzetünkről, akkor képesek leszünk
elérni céljainkat: így <b>az oktatásban érintettek és a szakma be lesznek vonva a
döntéshozatalba, és az oktatási rendszer nem fog hozzájárulni a társadalmi
különbségekhez</b>, nem fogja aláásni egyetlen diák egyedüli esélyét sem attól,

kell maradniuk az iskolában - 7 évesen is -, emellett rengeteg házi feladatot
is kapnak. Ezek elveszik a gyerekek szabadidejét, amelyet hasznosan
eltölthetnének például pihenésre. De ez a szabályozás abban is korlátozza őket,
hogy idővel maguk osszák be a saját idejüket, amely fontos része lenne a
felnőtté válásnak.
Ezek az átalakítások közvetlenül
érintenek bennünket, diákokat. Ez az életszakasz kulcsfontosságú
abban, hogy tudatos és a saját jogaiért kiálló felnőttekké válhassunk.


Beleszólást szeretnénk
a saját életünkbe. Semmilyen rólunk szóló kérdésben ne döntsenek nélkülünk!

Véleményünk szerint a jelenlegi oktatási
rendszer célja nem az, hogy bővítse a tudásunkat a világról és fejlessze a
gondolkodásunkat, hanem korlátozza a tanárokat és a diákokat, s ezáltal
engedelmes embereket neveljen, akik nem képesek kiállni magukért, hanem
egyetértenek mindennel, amit a felettük állók mondanak.
Továbbá a fennálló oktatási rendszer
növeli a társadalmi különbségeket a különböző társadalmi csoportok
között, ahelyett, hogy esélyegyenlőséget biztosítana a különböző családi- és
anyagi háttérrel rendelkező gyerekeknek. A társadalmi és kulturális
szempontból hátrányos helyzetű diákokat nem támogatja, közülük többen nem
is tudják az iskolában tölteni idejüket, mivel az iskolában hamar demotiválttá
válnak, szüleik pedig a segítségükre szorulnak a pénzkeresésében, hogy legyen
miből enniük. A minőségi oktatás hiánya a munkaerőpiac legaljára
kényszeríti őket, és egyben a magas szintű munkanélküliség egyik fő okozója.
Szerintünk a jelenlegi helyzet
befolyásolja az egész életünket és tönkreteheti a jövőnket. Rájöttünk, hogy
szükséges cselekednünk, és kiállnunk önmagunkért. Először is lehetőséget kell
adnunk diáktársainknak, hogy tisztában legyenek jogaikkal, hogy többet tudjanak
a demokráciáról és képesek legyenek cselekedni a közös érdekeikért.
Szeretnénk létrehozni egy önszerveződő
diákcsoportot, amely tagjai képesek kritikusan gondolkodni és nyomást
gyakorolni a döntéshozókra. A Független Diákparlament egy diákok által
szervezett demokratikusan működő fórum. Meg akarjuk mutatni, hogy a minket
érintő kérdésekben igenis van véleményünk, és képesek vagyunk konstruktív
ötletekkel és megoldásokkal előállni.
Mi, a szervezők egyedülálló módon dolgoztuk ki a
teljes rendszerét egy diákparlamentnek. Hiszünk abban, hogy lépésről lépésre
haladva elérhetjük, hogy az országunk valóban demokratikusan működjön.
Minden évben internetes választásokat tartunk, amelyek
során a középiskolás diákok szavazhatnak az általuk kiválasztott jelöltekre az
ország minden régiójában. A megválasztott képviselők a plenáris üléseken
személyesen, azok között pedig interneten keresztül szavazhatnak. (...)
Szükségünk van a segítségetekre, hogy
finanszírozhassuk a Független Diákparlamentet. Az adományozott összegből fogjuk
segíteni a vidéken élő diákok felutazását az ülésekre, meghirdetni a
kampány-időszakot és az internetes választást, továbbá eseményeket szervezni a
diákok számára és létrehozni egy még jobb elektronikus választási rendszert:
egy vonzó, letisztult és modern felületet, amely lehetővé teszi, hogy a diákok
titkosan szavazhassanak a nekik tetsző jelöltekre.
Már megszerveztük a Független Diákparlament első
ciklusát. Szeretnénk még több emberhez eljutni olcsó, de kreatív hirdetések és
a média segítségével, valamint tájékoztatni az iskolákat a 2015/2016. tanév
elején. A hirdetés szükséges ahhoz, hogy eljuttassuk híreinket a lehető legtöbb
diákhoz. Minél több diákot tudunk bevonni a folyamatba országszerte, annál
nagyobb esélyünk van arra, hogy elérjük céljainkat.
Köszönjük Mindannyiotoknak, akik adományozásra
méltónak találjátok a projektet, vagy csak végigolvastátok a leírást, mert
hisszük, hogy ha egyre többen értesülnek a helyzetünkről, akkor képesek leszünk
elérni céljainkat: így az oktatásban érintettek és a szakma be lesznek vonva a
döntéshozatalba, és az oktatási rendszer nem fog hozzájárulni a társadalmi
különbségekhez, nem fogja aláásni egyetlen diák egyedüli esélyét sem attól,
hogy - élhető jövővel - tanult emberré váljon, aki képes támogatni a közösséget
a saját gondolataival.

<p><b>The Problem </b></p>
<p>As of August 2013, the Los Angeles
Unified School District (LAUSD) decided to eliminate all third-party companies
like Arithmetic Solutions from the process of providing much needed free tutoring services to over
38,000 students in the more impoverished areas of Los Angeles.  Even
though ""<b><i>some""</i></b> students still receive free tutoring
on certain school campuses after school, a large number of students have no
access to tutoring; in most cases, these are the students who exhibit the most
need.  
Arithmetic Solutions
aims to provide a free and accessible
tutoring option for these students that will not create a financial burden for their families.</p>
<p><b>Our Company </b></p>
<p>Founder
Derrick Louis established Arithmetic Solutions in 2005, and in the Spring of
2006 Arithmetic Solutions was added to the list of Supplemental Education
Service (SES) Providers for the State of California.  Currently, the company
coordinates 30 Independent Contractors and maintains contracts with 5 school
districts in and around Los Angeles County.  To date Arithmetic Solutions has
provided over 1,500 students with math tutoring.  In doing so they have seen a
22% increase in scoring in 93% of their students.</p>
<p><b>Our Goal and Our Needs</b></p>
<p>In 2014 Arithmetic solutions, established an Online Tutoring
Platform (OTP) that allows students to access high quality Mathematics Tutoring
from the comforts of their own homes through the use of ""real-time""
audio &amp; video.  We currently provide online services to privately
paying customers and we would like to use this OTP to target 100 students in
inner-city Los Angeles and give them free mathematics tutoring for an entire
school year.  Our intent is to specifically select students who do not
have the financial means to pay for services privately.  We will closely monitor and record their progress.   </p>
<p>We aim to provide 100 students with
70 mathematics tutoring sessions taking place two times per week from September
2015 through June 2016 for a total cost of $50,000.00. </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>The Impact</b></span></p>
<p>Your contribution will aid in helping disadvantaged students
receive free academic help that could realistically change the trajectory of their
lives.  Many students located in areas such as South Central Los Angeles
do not have access to personal transportation, a resource that many individuals
take for granted.  For example, it is not
guaranteed that all parents have a car to transport their child to a learning
center for tutoring and far fewer have the $80.00 per hour to pay for services
once they arrive.  Using the Online Tutoring Platform will eliminate one
of the tutoring access hurdles by giving disadvantaged students the opportunity
to receive help at their local school’s computer lab or at home by using a
personal computer or laptop.  The other
hurdle of cost can be eliminated through your investment in our vision.  Your support of our efforts will allow us to offer a student access to much needed academic intervention as
well as help students make a successful transition to the NEW Common Core Standards. </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>You can help us by using you personal resources to let more people know
about the numbers of students who no longer have access to the tutoring
services that are so desperately needed.  Let other potential donors know
that we are in Los Angeles on the grassroots level helping students reach their
goals.  Our OTP for Mathematics &amp; Science can be made
available to everyone, we do not care where you live.  Please use the Indiegogo
tools and share our initiative via social media.</p>

<p><b>Inwood Academy for Leadership </b></p>
<p>Inwood Academy for Leadership
empowers students in Inwood and Washington Heights to become agents for change
through community-focused leadership, character development and college
preparedness.  </p>
<p>Our population is drawn directly from the Washington Heights
and Inwood community, where an average of 27% of children live below the
federal poverty threshold.  We advocated
successfully in offering preference to English Language Learners (ELL) within
our lottery, establishing an average of 41% “high needs” students (those having
ELL status, an IEP, or both).  We began
our first school year in 2010 as a small group of eager teachers charged with
the task of meeting the specific learning needs of our students. </p>
<p><b>Career Readiness</b></p>
<p>Many young people never get the opportunity to participate
in education as a transformative experience. 
The “path to college” represents a vision of success that many deserving
students fail to achieve due to the difficult living conditions and familial
problems associated with poverty.  In our
community 13% of adults are unemployed and only 19% of adults 25 and older have
a high school diploma or equivalent. 
Living below the poverty line means that potential does not guarantee
success.  </p>
<p>Although the “college prep” model may work for some of our
students, we work with a diverse population of learners.  Many of our students are drawn to a more
“hands-on” style of learning, where they can acquire the skills needed to
promote career readiness.  As the economy
continues to fluctuate, ALL our students need to be prepared for a job market
that is highly competitive and where a college degree doesn’t necessarily
guarantee employment.  </p>
<p>Research suggests that other schools across the country are
beginning to recognize the need for Career and Technology Education (CTE) for
high school students.  The manufacturing
industry is growing at an exponential rate all across the country, contributing
to an increasingly large market for skilled job opportunities.  Learning by “doing” has become a major force
propelling the rise of business opportunities for entrepreneurs.  Studies done on the small subset of high
school students that have access to vocational training indicate that a growing
number of graduates move on to well-paid, highly skilled postsecondary
careers.  </p>
<p><b>Fundraising Campaign</b></p>
<p>To meet the needs of students whom would most benefit from
alternative pathways to graduation, it is imperative that we establish an
official Career and Technical Education Program at Inwood.  Universally recognized and endorsed by the
NYSED, CTE programs are meant to provide an additional level of individualized
support in the educational program and to increase the number of options for
students to achieve postsecondary success. </p>
<p>Inwood Academy currently offers an introductory
woodworking course that takes place during the school day, along with a program
for advanced students offered afterschool and on weekends.  If we raise the funding needed to expand our
CTE workshop, IAL will be able to fully develop the CTE program as an
alternative pathway to graduation with additional coursework and alignment to
industry standards.  Due to budget constraints the school has
been unable to provide funding for this program, leaving the instructor personally
responsible for all the expenses. 
Although we are fortunate enough to have dedicated classroom space, we
cannot sustain our CTE program without additional funding.  A renovated workshop space will enable us to
increase the number of CTE courses we offer our students.  Contributions made to the Urban
Woodworking Project will be used to establish a facility with the resources,
materials, and equipment that encourage creativity and facilitate deep
learning.  </p>
<p><b>Proposed Course Offerings (2016-17) </b></p>

</div></div>","Surveillance. Civil liberties. Protests. Arrests.  
From the rise of the Occupy movement to the outrage over the National Security Agency’s data collection, these words have become familiar to anyone who scans news headlines.
But if you take  a step behind the scenes, a complex interplay of social power and ever-changing legal precedents are the real drivers behind who is allowed to march and who can be surveilled and how.
Scrappers Film Group, in collaboration with Truthout.org, presents a multi-part web series to turn the camera on the most pressing civil liberties issues of our day.  Rights Lab is a cross-genre web series that dissects the most pressing civil liberties questions of our day while bringing viewers straight into the action through on-screen experiments. 
By using real-life case studies, featuring local activists and offering clear and compelling explanations of ongoing legal debates, our series will illuminate the legal and social dynamics behind Stingray surveillance, when and how it is legal to film a police officer, the burgeoning debate behind consumer drone flight, what you legally can and can’t do on social media, and much more.
Your help will make this series possible by:

</h3> <p>Winter is coming , they say, and so is my PhD, starting this October. I managed to convince the University of Glasgow that George R.R. Martin's Revolution in Literature is more than just a Fantasy series. However, it is now, as I realised, that the hardest part is coming: Funding my research.</p>
<p>I am Matteo Barbagallo, 25 and I have just completed my MA in English and Comparative Literature at ""La Sapienza"" University of Rome. It could seem silly or simple to say, but books, comics, and creating stories have always been my passion. During my school years I volunteered in a library and this is where it all began. In fact, there were mountains, volcanoes of books to read and never enough time, but luckily I had the time to discover some stories that are really worth a life of study. In Italy though, scholarships are not easily obtained, especially not for merit. This unfair condition is one of the motivations why I am glad to be allowed to do my research in the UK.</p>
<h3>... and now let's turn to the protagonist...<br/>
</h3>
<p>My research is based on the contemporary writer George R.R. Martin, in whose writing emerges clearly how he modifies our perception of reality. I will explore extensively how ""his realism"" differs from his biggest ancestor, J.R.R. Tolkien, and other fantastic novelists all along the centuries, and hopefully be able to demonstrate a new kind of Realism, invented by Martin, unique and powerful. Though Martin has an enormous fellowship and has been translated into more than 45 langauges, in this academic field his narration is still highly undervalued and this research would be the first worldwide, analysing the various levels of narration and realism. From my point of view it is a great lack of information that literature is missing out on and which could become a literary revolution for future generations.</p>
<p>Of course my goals go beyond. I am working towards an academic career, trying to become not only a Professor at University, but a good one: One capable of carrying people away with Literature.<br/></p>
<h3><b>Here is where I need your contribution:</b></h3>
<p>Unfortunately I, as most of us, was not born heir to the Iron Throne, and I have no Petyr Littlefinger to misteriously obtain any funds I need, this is why I've decided to start this crowdfundng campaign, trying to find people who believe in my research as much as I and the University of Glasgow do.</p>
<p>I am not eligible for a full British Scholarship according to the ESRC residential criteria, which asks for at least 3 years of previous residence in the UK. The tuition fees for three years full time research are £ 12.156, and I have rounded up the sum to have a little more space for creativity. However all money goes uncut to tuition fees (and if I should be so lucky and exceed this amount it would go to housing and living expenses).</p>
<h3>A win-win situation:<br/>
</h3>
<p>I feel particularly happy to be able to offer you a very special perk to thank you for your contribution. Every donor will be kept updated via email, cited in the PhD and never forgotten, but for every £ 35 donation, I will send you a personalized poem of mine.<br/></p>
<p>By generously supporting my campaign with £ 100 or more, you are pre-ordering a paperback copy of my thesis, 
which will be finished by the end of 2018, and helping me to cover my

Our goal is to implement a training center, where Deaf farmers can learn in FSL (Filippino Sign Language) the way, how to grow and what to do post harvest for  high quality cocoa.   Creating the training material in Sign Language  Setting up training facilities Providing plants for ""new farmers"" additional to the training
Creating the fair trade sales channel for the cocoa beans
   What We Need    Part of the money raised will be spent on the technical assets needed for the learning material. Translations, small studio for creating training videos, providing learning material and tools for the first practical trainings .
The rest  will be spent on the cost of facilities  for the first 1 year and contributing to the set up of a Business Service Center.
 
   The Impact This innovative Farmer Business School delivers trainings in Filipino Sign Language and trains Deaf farmers. It provides training and agricultural know how for rural cocoa farmers exclusively in Sign Language. It will integrate a farm management approach, increasing profit from cocoa, and also the annual business planning. Business Service Centers (BSC) serves as a hub of services including credit and market information in Sign Language. 
The dual impact is on one side a long term and sustainable livelihood project for the Deaf,  AND a great quality cocoa supply for chocolate manufacturer as result. 
    Other Ways You Can Help If you cannot contribute financially, you still can  help:  get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Share the information by using the Indiegogo tools",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Last year February, I had the honor of teaching an
art workshop at More Than Me Academy in Monrovia, Liberia, (Image above). The topic
of lecture was Self- Love, and the girls were given the task of drawing and writing
what they love most about themselves. The kids were so appreciative of the art
supplies that I donated, as were the teachers! These supplies made for more of
a personal display of their feelings, as they enjoyed the mediums they were
using to communicate. The things we have often taken for granted were all the
more special to them and in turn showed and helped them realize their own
passions, purpose, confidence, and creativity. The twinkle in their eyes and
bright smiles on their faces sparked a greater desire within me to launch the
ART OF HEARTS initiative.</p>
<p>Please join me in keeping that fire and twinkle alive! Many children in developing countries endure unbelievable pain and burdens at such young ages; from pandemics, to becoming orphans, and are cheated of the chance to develop in a healthy environment and to envision a better future for themselves. I strongly believe in the therapeutic power of art and the outlet it provides! Your donations will make it possible to travel to Monrovia, Liberia and Accra, Ghana this Christmas season to teach art workshops and deliver art supplies to about 75- 100 students. These specialty lectures will include art education and the use of specific artistic mediums but most importantly encourage self-expression through it all.</p>
<p>As a former refugee, I strive to not let the
history of my country define me but to help re-define my country and many
developing countries around the world, through art. I can vividly recall the
hardships that come with living in a developing nation. I lived in Liberia
until the age of five and I was fortunate to be able to immigrate to the United
States, where I was able to cultivate my talent in, and passion for the arts.
Growing up in the U.S. made me acutely aware of the many privileges I was
allowed, and the stark contrast between my realities and that of
millions of less fortunate children around the world.</p>
<p>Together, let's help them express their hearts
through art. We can help children who have been through tremendous difficulties
find their voices in ways that they probably never thought were possible, and
learn how the facets of an artistic perspective can be applied to many aspects
in life. Furthermore, touching on integral topics that aid in our personal
growth and advancement as human beings. </p>

<h3>Very Briefly</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Coworking
for Hope is a charity. Its objective is to raise USD 30,000 to buy 33 cows for
needy Ugandan families. In August 2016, its co-creators, six young students
living in Switzerland, will make sure that the money is well spent by giving
the money directly in Uganda. There are several reasons why cows can
sustainably help, e.g.:</p>
<p></p>
<h3></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Cows produce milk during
approximately 10 years</li>
<li>Milk can be sold to create
revenues</li>
<li>Cows help in creating some manure,
increasing crop yield</li>
<li>Cows give birth to new calves, building a continuously growing network<br/>
</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3></h3>

<p><br/></p>
<h3>Where Is the Money Going to?</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>All
the collected money will be used to buy and maintain cows. A bank account has
been created under the association name (implying an acknowledgment of the
association by the Swiss bank). All the money is collected through this account. It will not be used to cover travel or administrative expenses, meaning that each donated cent will end up in Uganda. Our
association statutes (in conformity with the Swiss law) express these statements.
These statutes and our goal can be found on our website (<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/sustainably-support-ugandan-families-with-a-cow/www.coworkingforhope.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.coworkingforhope.org</span></a>, in French only).</p>

</div> </div>","Very Briefly


Coworking
for Hope is a charity. Its objective is to raise USD 30,000 to buy 33 cows for
needy Ugandan families. In August 2016, its co-creators, six young students
living in Switzerland, will make sure that the money is well spent by giving
the money directly in Uganda. There are several reasons why cows can
sustainably help, e.g.:




Cows produce milk during
approximately 10 years
Milk can be sold to create
revenues
Cows help in creating some manure,
increasing crop yield
Cows give birth to new calves, building a continuously growing network


  


Where Is the Money Going to?




All
the collected money will be used to buy and maintain cows. A bank account has
been created under the association name (implying an acknowledgment of the
association by the Swiss bank). All the money is collected through this account. It will not be used to cover travel or administrative expenses, meaning that each donated cent will end up in Uganda. Our
association statutes (in conformity with the Swiss law) express these statements.
These statutes and our goal can be found on our website (www.coworkingforhope.org, in French only).



The Impact
All the collected money will be used to buy
cows. Here is how we plan to spend this USD 30,000 (1CHF =1USD):

1 cow = CHF 800
Annual fees for 1 cow = CHF 40
Annual medical services (local)
= CHF 50

==> 1 cow = CHF 890 = 1 family
==> CHF 30,000 = 33 cows = 198 families = 792 people !
  

If a different amount of money is collected (greater
or smaller than USD 30,000), the number of cows will be simply adapted in
accordance to the above formula.



Why Trusting Us?
 

The
team
We are 6
young and motivated people living in different areas of Switzerland (see
gallery). Most of us are university students To create this charity, we all agreed
on the same following principles:

All the money collected will be used
for the cows (no personal expenditure nor administrative fees)

The solution we provide has to be
both sustainable and absolutely essential to the beneficiaries



Our priority is to struggle against
poverty and hunger





A collaboration
with FH Suisse
The local Ugandan
partners we will work with, their networks, and their logistics is based on a
reliable relationship they have had for many years with FH Suisse (Food for the
Hungry). FH Suisse is a charity created in 1996.  In 2014, they spent more than USD 700,000 in
humanitarian projects. Furthermore, they are members of the Fédération genevoise de
cooperation (FGC), a well-established network of more than 60 charities active in Switzerland.

<p>Dear friends of sustainable living,</p>
<p>I am pleased to announce the launching of the IndieGoGo
campaign and seek your support for the completion and promotion of <i>Learning for Sustainable Living</i> (LfSL),
an online learning program which utilises an integrated approach to sustainable living. </p>
<p>Today there is increasing public acknowledgment that a sustainable
future for our children and us will require profound changes in perceptions and
practices in large parts of the world’s population. More than 100 Million
people in many countries, people often referred to as Cultural Creatives, have
been practicing some aspects of sustainable living for the last several
decades.</p>
<p>Our program aims to bring
together the most notable of these elements by integrating:</p>

<h3>Minister Jameliah
Young-Mitchell and her husband Calvin Mitchell has over twenty five years of
combined experience in ministry on several different levels. Calvin Mitchell
operates in his gift of business administration and Minister Jameliah operates
in the gift of the prophetic as well as teaching and preaching. </h3>
<h3>DESCRIPTION
OF THE CAMPAIGN: </h3>
<h3>If you are reading
this right now I am sure you have experienced a level of pain hurt and
disappointment. As we look around, depression is on an all time high and people
have taken out their anger hurt and depression out on the world.  We all
have looked at several situations where the theory of hurt people hurt people
and clinch our heart on the devastation cause by pain.  Now at some point
when you experience pain you have two places.</h3>
<p>The hospital and some sort of faith lets just call it a
church for arguments sake.  How is it that the places where you are
supposed to heal have added pain to your already existing circumstance? 
Well this is where you have an opportunity to experience church unusual. 
Let’s be honest, we all are looking for a level of faith and friendship that
will help us through our difficult times.  LET US DO THAT.  Here at
MJ Ministries ECU we are building a gateway via social media that will expand
help to the hurting people.  </p>
<p>MJ Ministries ECU will help revive the hope that this
world has either snatched or just made life so hard until people feel hope has
gone. You will be surprise how much a little encouragement goes just a long way.</p>
<p>Have you ever waited for the approval or the encouragement
from a parent of love one?  How beautiful it is to be in the assembly with
encouraging people who not only show you that you ware fearfully and
wonderfully made; But will help you navigate through life on a high note of ALL
THING ARE POSSIBLE THOUGH CHRIST FOR THOSE WHO LOVE THE LORD AND ARE CALL UNTO
HIS PURPOSE. PHILIPPIANS 4:13</p>
<p>Circumstances. 
MJ Ministries ECU will help you right where you are it can be you the reader or
anyone who you know that may need a life line. WE ARE HERE FOR YOU! </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>I recall one
day I was in a church and I was ask to come see a young lady that had a loaded
hand gun in her bag.  Through the grace of GOD the word she heard allowed
her to come to my office and hand over the weapon and get help.  </p>
<h3>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If we can work
together to meet our financial goal of $50,000 we can start getting the things
we need to help the people.  </p>
<p>Shelter, Food,
Clothing, Transportation, Counseling, Conferences, Workshops Events, and much
more.......</p>
<p>MJ Ministries
ECU is a ministry of transparency, visibility and accountability. Before you
sow anything pray. As you sow your seed you must understand the principals of
seedtime and harvest. The ground of where you contribute monetarily must be
fertile ground, which I know MJ Ministries ECU are.  Your funding will help
us reach the depressed of this nation. Each dime contributed will be accounted
for. Every quarter we will provide a report on our page as to where your seed
is going and testimonies on the lives you have help change.  You will see
the product of your seed and how we watered it as GOD has gotten the
increase. The Perks for our contributors are monthly news letters along
with free conferences, events and workshops.</p>
<p>We at MJ
Ministries ECU will help you find your purpose thought workshops, conferences,
providing you with step by step guide using the word of GOD and even your day
to day experiences in the most unusual way that will help you see thing
differently.  With your help together we can do that.  There are so
many people who are just stuck and have no direction on how to unlock the fuel
needed to get them to the next level due to life and situations. MJ
Ministries ECU believe that a healthy MIND, SOUL and BODY can create a healthy
YOU. </p>
<p>We will provide
at the workshops and conferences: </p>
<p>For women hurting from divorce and/or domestic
violence. The funds will help us get them the counseling they so very well
need. </p>
<p><b>THE LADY
BUG PROJECT</b></p>
<p>MJ Ministries ECU will provide make overs, along with
tools preparing them for the work place. Sometimes even helping purchase suites
and clothing to help them  get interview ready plus, much more. MJ
Ministries realize in shelters there are people who have nothing to wear to
secure a job.</p>
<p><b>BUILDING AN
ARK</b></p>
<p>The Ark is a
project created to help young men understand the development of manhood and
bridge the gap helping men understand the importance of being a father. Your
funds will even help MJ Ministries ECU provide workshops and conferences geared
toward the hurting man. </p>
<p><b>YOUR
CONTRIBUTION IS NEEDED</b></p>
<p>1. <b>Please donate whatever amount you can to help us
reach our fundraising goal.</b> Every single donation helps, whether large
or small, and we will be grateful for whatever you can do.</p>
<p>2. <b>Please pray for the hurting people of this world
that needs this ministry.</b> Pray that the hearts of the people will be
opened to hearing the gospel. Pray that Jameliah and Calvin will be bold and
loving in sharing that good news while serving the people. Pray for this crowd
funding effort to be successful.</p>
<h3>Other
Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We realize
everyone can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help: </p>
<p><b>Please share the link for this fundraising campaign on
your social media sites.</b> Spreading the word about this
need will help bring it before the eyes of those whom God is preparing to give
to this effort. Please share it on Facebook, Twitter, Tumbler, Pinterest,
Instagram, or wherever your sphere of influence may touch.</p>
<p>Thank you in
advance for your wonderful and generous support!</p>

secure a job.

</h3>
<p>Kamp Khalil, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) organization that was founded in 2003. The mission of Kamp Khalil is to provide holistic Islamic programming designed to empower youth with the knowledge and skills necessary to become global leaders impacting our social fabric by positively affecting change in the areas of business, education, politics, and culture.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What do we do? </h3>
<p>Since 2004, Kamp Khalil has established itself as a leadership and youth development institution. What began as a 4-day summer camp has evolved into an organization that serves the needs of America’s youth year-round. We have served youth ages 12-17 from over 32 states during our summer sessions, winter sessions, as well as at various local, state, and national conferences.</p>
<p>Our success can be directly attributed to our faith and belief in Allah (swt) and the life example of Prophet Muhammad (saw). We approach our work with a spirit of service and sacrifice. We are passionate about youth development. Our time, resources, and knowledge are completely invested in our youth. We want to leave this Earth knowing that we did our part to provide a positive example of preparing our future generations for leadership.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Who do we serve?  </h3>
<p>What makes Kamp Khalil unique is that we develop youth from a holistic approach.  All of our sessions are content rich, yet activity based. Participants learn through diagram models, guided practice, group discussion, public speaking, team building, and self-directed presentations Content includes but is not limited to financial literacy, goal setting, critical thinking, business plan formulation, civic engagement, healthy communication skills, time management, networking, self- discovery, proactivity, entrepreneurial development, overcoming adversity, understanding diversity, identifying and handling bullying, and conflict resolution.</p>
<p>Creative expression is another key ingredient within our programming. Participants gain experience using raw materials to create and produce. Developing their skill set increases their self-efficacy and enhances their ability to succeed. Our participants have crafted pillows, jewelry, and rugs. They have also learned the importance of using natural products on their bodies through mixing and formulating individualized shower gels and lip balms. Our Talent Showcase is the highlight! Everyone participants through various performing arts. </p>
<p>Health education and physical fitness are the highlights of our summer and winter camps. Participants have participated in workshops on nutrition, positive mental attitude, hygiene, and dietary needs. Physical activity includes kickball, dodgeball, dance, yoga, basketball, canoeing, and our signature activity Khalil Khaos, which is a team competition comprised of both physical and mental challenges.</p>

<h2>MEET THE CREW BEHIND URBS IN HORTO</h2>
<p><i>A Space Where Knowledge Flows Between Professions and Industries</i></p>
<p><br/>Urbs in Horto is a collaborative initiative between two chefs, fifteen artists, five videographers, one architect, six business owners, one mixologist, two graphic designers, and all of whom are activists.</p>
<p>To create a purpose-driven experience that stimulates the five senses, we've brought together a specific group of creatives whose talents (when combined,) have the ability to transform an ordinary space into an alternate reality. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WE BELIEVE</h3>
<p>In order to create empathy and respect for a life thats different from your own,  you need to <i>feel</i> where that individual is coming from. You need to <i>feel</i> the why behind their reasoning<strong>. </strong></p>

<h3>Throughout this event, we've intertwined the five senses to stimulate a shared feeling of hope around this legalization; instilling in our guests the opportunity for each and every one of them to stand up for freedom and equality in the state of Illinois. </h3>

<h2>DINNER</h2>
<p>The team behind Urbs in Horto believes that when an individual eats a new dish and enjoys it, that experience gives them an appreciation of the culture and community from where that dish came.</p>
<p>To shine light and love on some of the Chicago communities that have been largely criminalized and pushed to the fringes of our cityscape, Chef Skyler Dees and Chef Fresh Roberson have brought to life (through taste and smell) cherished delicacies from these communities: </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Austin, Back of the Yards, Englewood, Garfield Park, Humboldt Park, Lawndale, and South Shore. </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The adult-use cannabis bill in IL. includes provisions to specifically help Chicagoans who come from these communities -- our people who have been disproportionately targeted, policed, and arrested for consuming a plant thats usage is <strong>equal</strong> among races.</p>

<h3>ART EXHIBITION &amp; SILENT AUCTION</h3>
<p>Directly following the roundtable discussion, the art exhibit and silent auction will take place in a studio one floor above the dining space. </p>
<p>Shifting the medium to art, and expanding our invitation to the general public + Chicagoans interested in the cannabis scene, the exhibit uses the power of visual stimulation (i.e. videography, photography, projection mapping, street art, and paintings,) to continue and expand upon the conversations sparked during the course of the dinner. </p>

<h3>To do this, we <u>need</u> your support.</h3>

To shine light and love on some of the Chicago communities that have been largely criminalized and pushed to the fringes of our cityscape, Chef Skyler Dees and Chef Fresh Roberson have brought to life (through taste and smell) cherished delicacies from these communities: 
 
Austin, Back of the Yards, Englewood, Garfield Park, Humboldt Park, Lawndale, and South Shore. 
 
The adult-use cannabis bill in IL. includes provisions to specifically help Chicagoans who come from these communities -- our people who have been disproportionately targeted, policed, and arrested for consuming a plant thats usage is equal among races.

ART EXHIBITION & SILENT AUCTION
Directly following the roundtable discussion, the art exhibit and silent auction will take place in a studio one floor above the dining space. 
Shifting the medium to art, and expanding our invitation to the general public + Chicagoans interested in the cannabis scene, the exhibit uses the power of visual stimulation (i.e. videography, photography, projection mapping, street art, and paintings,) to continue and expand upon the conversations sparked during the course of the dinner.

WHY NOT JUST CHARGE FOR A TICKET?
We want to make sure that we have a diverse body of Chicagoans represented at the Urbs in Horto roundtable dinner discussion. So rather than charging $150/ticket (the starting point for a multi-course dinner like this,) we're inviting our guests free of charge. 
 
To do this, we need your support.
 
We also want to give other individuals (who might not live in Chicago) an opportunity to use their $$$ as a way to join the conversation - opening up the doors for additional ways to become an activist.  
The more we talk about this plant, the various ways it affects our lives, and the systemic change it can bring to communities of color, the more we can de-stigmatize its use and bring it out of the shadows of society. 
 

 
IF YOU CAN'T SUPPORT US FINANCIALLY, YOU STILL CAN SUPPORT OUR MISSION.

Share our campaign!
The more people that learn about what we're doing, the more people we'll be able to bring onboard this train of conscious consumerism and advocacy in the cannabis space.
If you have a personal story involving cannabis, and you want to share it, we want to hear it.
 
It's never too late to join the conversation.

By using the #myurbsinhorto hashtag, you are standing in solidarity with our mission. 
 
While the Urbs in Horto initiatives involves discussions regarding cannabis, this movement is not solely designed for those who consume it; 
rather, this is an opportunity for anyone and everyone who cares about social responsibility and standing up for those who have been impacted by the War on Drugs in Illinois.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><u><i>Our Mission:</i></u></p>
<p>Our mission is to gift learners with space, time, and support to experience self-discovery and emotional growth through personalized holistic learning.</p>
<p><u><i>Our Vision:</i></u></p>
<p>Bloom Learning Community fosters empowered global citizens who are confident, capable, and compassionate agents of positive change.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">...Every creation begins with a dream.</h3>

<p>When we became parents, we consciously wanted to create a nurturing and supportive environment for our kids. We did this to the best of our ability as we learned and grew alongside our young children.</p>
<p><strong>As parents, we dream that our children experience freedom for both inner growth and outer expansion as they unfold towards their full potential.</strong></p>
<p>Once our children were old enough to start school, we wanted to continue to make conscious choices for our families.<strong> For many of us, it’s a challenge to choose among current education options.</strong> We decided the traditional school system wouldn’t provide the best experience for our kids. We kept them home and continued to enjoy learning together.</p>
<p>As our kids grew, we longed to expand our options. To enrich their days and experience being a part of a close community. However, <strong>when we searched through our available choices again, we still couldn't find a learning option that matched our dreams for our children.</strong></p>
<h3>So we bravely decided to create one.</h3>

<p>We have strongly held values about learning that we couldn't find reflected in the available choices in our area. Ultimately dissatisfaction with aspects of both the traditional school model and homeschooling led us to imagine a different alternative.</p>
<p><strong>We dreamed of a place where we would feel happy, proud, and excited to send our children all day.</strong></p>
<p>A place that saw our kids as unique individuals with strengths, passions, and purpose waiting to be nurtured and encouraged.</p>

<p>A caring place for our kids to feel at home while we could also pursue interests, practice self-care, self-development, grow careers, and create positive change in the world.</p>
<p><strong><i>We desired enrichment that respects personal differences and lovingly challenges our kids to dive deep into inner discovery and reach higher towards their full potential.</i></strong></p>
<p>A thoughtfully well-designed and organized program that would truly prepare kids for the challenges and opportunities of the future... to be powerful agents of social change... to be open-minded and open-hearted... to be creative in their visions for themselves and their world - and to feel capable and confident to carry out those visions.</p>

<h3>What does ‘Arabic’ mean to me?</h3>
<p>I have been looking into art and design as an expression of cultural identity since I was a design student, learning about art history and artists whose vision shaped the world we live in today. When I looked closely at the Arab world’s artistic contribution, I found one uniquely dominant element: <strong>calligraphy</strong>. </p>
<p>This finding sparked my interest in letters, in their forms and proportions as well as their connection to who we are. </p>
<p>If art is an expression of our cultural identity, and if calligraphy is the hallmark of our artistic tradition, are Arabic letters then the closest visual representation of who we are? If so, how are we using them today to express our identity?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How does Arabic Typography measure up to Arabic Calligraphy?</h3>
<p>Today, the level of support for Arabic in digital communication is substandard in comparison to other languages. Specifically, only a limited number of Arabic fonts exist commercially, often unpolished or even missing characters. </p>
<p>Arabic font designers have been struggling to preserve and update the form of the language, especially as the technology has been changing faster than the ability to adapt to it. Add to this problem the pressure for Arab corporations to compete in a global market. As a result, designers are left with little room to creatively experiment with ways in which letters can reflect our contemporary identity and diversity as Arabs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564756512/r4gmb9vbgmy2uuwcrswv.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>My journey with Arabic Calligraphy</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564762467/oj23xzew0b9svmkbugv8.svg"" src=""""/><br/>As a graphic designer, I used calligraphy to compensate for the scarcity of Arabic fonts. Even though my isolated efforts failed to address the broader underlying problem, they led me to the UK, where there is a strong type design community that helped me explore the issue from both theoretical and practical perspectives.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564762482/tuqz8yqwepr8xytdb8gv.svg"" src=""""/>As a type designer, I continued to deepen my understanding of the field from both historical and technological perspectives. I took a Codicology and Palaeography course at the University of Cambridge to study the history of Arabic manuscripts and the writing system, as well as a coding course at General Assembly. I also spent a month at DecoType in Amsterdam learning about their trademark font technology for connected scripts.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564762499/igvehru8ecsc8hv6nqw9.svg"" src=""""/>Through these experiences, I understood that I was missing a crucial perspective: economic. The problem with the current state of Arabic digital communication is not a lack of research, skills nor technological resources. Rather, it is a lack of profitable and sustainable business and licensing models that govern the design, production and distribution of fonts for emerging markets, especially on the web. This issue is taken for granted but there are many language communities that are under-represented in the digital space because they cannot afford to digitally recreate their languages on their own.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>My Next Stop: MBA</h3>
<p>During my ten months at INSEAD, I will learn about designing and refining business models for the creative industries in emerging markets. My goal is to develop the skills needed to profitably run creative digital initiatives, from retail font libraries to website builders to educational platforms, that are tailored to our language and culture. This move, I believe, will bring me a giant step closer to my vision: an Arabic type foundry serving the communication needs of the Arabic-scripted world and headquartered in an Arab country, so that we wouldn’t have to go abroad to look for Arabic. In other words, my vision is to<strong> bring Arabic back home</strong>.</p>

</div></div>","What does ‘Arabic’ mean to me?
I have been looking into art and design as an expression of cultural identity since I was a design student, learning about art history and artists whose vision shaped the world we live in today. When I looked closely at the Arab world’s artistic contribution, I found one uniquely dominant element: calligraphy. 
This finding sparked my interest in letters, in their forms and proportions as well as their connection to who we are. 
If art is an expression of our cultural identity, and if calligraphy is the hallmark of our artistic tradition, are Arabic letters then the closest visual representation of who we are? If so, how are we using them today to express our identity?

How does Arabic Typography measure up to Arabic Calligraphy?
Today, the level of support for Arabic in digital communication is substandard in comparison to other languages. Specifically, only a limited number of Arabic fonts exist commercially, often unpolished or even missing characters. 
Arabic font designers have been struggling to preserve and update the form of the language, especially as the technology has been changing faster than the ability to adapt to it. Add to this problem the pressure for Arab corporations to compete in a global market. As a result, designers are left with little room to creatively experiment with ways in which letters can reflect our contemporary identity and diversity as Arabs.
 


My journey with Arabic Calligraphy
As a graphic designer, I used calligraphy to compensate for the scarcity of Arabic fonts. Even though my isolated efforts failed to address the broader underlying problem, they led me to the UK, where there is a strong type design community that helped me explore the issue from both theoretical and practical perspectives.
As a type designer, I continued to deepen my understanding of the field from both historical and technological perspectives. I took a Codicology and Palaeography course at the University of Cambridge to study the history of Arabic manuscripts and the writing system, as well as a coding course at General Assembly. I also spent a month at DecoType in Amsterdam learning about their trademark font technology for connected scripts.
Through these experiences, I understood that I was missing a crucial perspective: economic. The problem with the current state of Arabic digital communication is not a lack of research, skills nor technological resources. Rather, it is a lack of profitable and sustainable business and licensing models that govern the design, production and distribution of fonts for emerging markets, especially on the web. This issue is taken for granted but there are many language communities that are under-represented in the digital space because they cannot afford to digitally recreate their languages on their own.

My Next Stop: MBA
During my ten months at INSEAD, I will learn about designing and refining business models for the creative industries in emerging markets. My goal is to develop the skills needed to profitably run creative digital initiatives, from retail font libraries to website builders to educational platforms, that are tailored to our language and culture. This move, I believe, will bring me a giant step closer to my vision: an Arabic type foundry serving the communication needs of the Arabic-scripted world and headquartered in an Arab country, so that we wouldn’t have to go abroad to look for Arabic. In other words, my vision is to bring Arabic back home.

<h3>Writing Master Classes That Matter </h3>
<p>Since our launch in 2003, Under the Volcano has become a magnet for both emerging and accomplished writers from Mexico and around the world, dozens of whom have gone on to publish and win prizes. Thanks to the incredible support of local hosts and donors and a healthy supply of energy, we’ve been able to make our initial vision a reality year after year. However, we are now at a point where we need more funds to bring our next crop of writers and journalists together for our January 2018 master classes. Writers apply to Under the Volcano because of its reputation for excellence and its commitment to inclusiveness of every kind (literary style, language, nationality, ethnicity and race). And because they know it works: our online community lights up almost every week with news of alumni linked over time and space—fellowships, literary prizes, articles, book publications and contracts with top publishers.</p>

<h3><strong>Our Mission is More Urgent Than Ever!</strong></h3>
<p>Now more than ever, words matter.  Writing has the power to cut through harsh rhetoric and polarizing discourse. Novelists and poets connect readers across boundaries and cultures, while courageous journalists expose the truth. By identifying and encouraging the best new writers and by bringing them together in a community of peers, Under the Volcano continues to play its part in building the global awareness so critical for our survival.  As a non-profit, we remain committed to making our program affordable to all qualified applicants.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511040664/uulyf1wg8lodnsmmadot.png"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<h3><strong>Why We Need to Raise $10,000 Now</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>We raised $9000 for scholarships at our fourth annual fundraiser in September, but we’re still $6000 short of the funds we need to bring another dozen wonderful writers who are waiting to hear whether we can help them with tuition or travel subsidies so they can join us.  We will also draw on this fund to offer modest stipends to a handful of local young people who will participate this year as interns, continuing the successful pilot we began three years ago, which has already seen hesitant high school graduates find the confidence to make the leap to college.</p>
<h3>Why Under the Volcano?</h3>
<p>A few of our recent alumni in their own words...</p>
<p><i>“The time I spent in Tepoztlán working on my novel was magical. It re-charged my batteries so that I could finally get through my first draft.”</i></p>

<p><i>“The dream always is to feel that writing is your only job in life. At Under the Volcano that dream becomes real.”</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">                                                            Tim MacGhabban, Ireland</p>
<p><i>“Under the Volcano is not just about the writing. Never has a combination of place, people and program felt so powerful and inspiring.”</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">                                                            Natalie Hart, United Kingdom</p>
<p><i>“The journalism workshop opened my eyes to the possibility of thinking deeply about a subject and having a voice in the piece while still doing the job of reporter. It was an awakening for me personally but also something I could bring back to the Seattle Times and use in my work there.""</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">                                                            Tyrone Beason, Seattle</p>
<p><i>“I had been hungry for an opportunity to write in Mexico, my ancestral homeland. The energy of Tepoztlán nurtured my creative process and allowed me access to stories I’d forgotten.”</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">                                                            Norma Liliana Valdez, California</p>
<p><i>“When I was feeling overwhelmed at the sheer talent and accomplishments of the faculty, a fellow student said to me, 'The only difference between them and us is time.'”</i></p>

<p>The September 19<sup>th</sup> earthquake caused extensive damage in Tepoztlán, our village base, and we’re still scrambling to shift some of the key events of this special season, our fifteenth, which will see the launch of our first anthology (see our perks list to get your copy!), the world premiere of a song cycle by composer Felipe Pérez Santiago (downloads &amp; CD's also on our list of perks) and the exhibit and sale of a stunning silkscreen commissioned from Cuernavaca artist Cisco Jiménez (available in limited edition prints to donors on the high end of our list.)</p>
<p>The earthquake has also hit the budgets of our many Mexican participants, some of whom were forced to move and/or lost work. And it hit home. Promised support from the local sponsors for several of our planned projects, including the anthology, has not come through and we are looking at $2000 in printing costs that we had not anticipated.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Giving Back to Our Village</strong></h3>
<p>Finally, we would like to be able to contribute to the reconstruction work in Tepoztlán. The first $1.000 of this campaign will go to several groups already working in the village to help families whose houses were either destroyed or rendered uninhabitable by the quake and to rebuild the 16<sup>th</sup> century churches whose bell towers collapsed.  We will also contribute to the reconstruction of the village’s crown jewel, the historic Museo del Ex-Convento, where we have held so many memorable readings and events with writers including Grace Paley, Maureen Howard, Breyten Breytenbach, Carolyn Forché, Russell Banks, Jonathan Levi, Elena Poniatowska, Francisco Goldman, Jennifer Clement, Sandra Cisneros and, just last year, Luisa Valenzuela.</p>

<p>We also need funds to document this year’s program in order to move Under the Volcano to the next level.

Since our launch in 2003, Under the Volcano has become a magnet for both emerging and accomplished writers from Mexico and around the world, dozens of whom have gone on to publish and win prizes. Thanks to the incredible support of local hosts and donors and a healthy supply of energy, we’ve been able to make our initial vision a reality year after year. However, we are now at a point where we need more funds to bring our next crop of writers and journalists together for our January 2018 master classes. Writers apply to Under the Volcano because of its reputation for excellence and its commitment to inclusiveness of every kind (literary style, language, nationality, ethnicity and race). And because they know it works: our online community lights up almost every week with news of alumni linked over time and space—fellowships, literary prizes, articles, book publications and contracts with top publishers.


Our Mission is More Urgent Than Ever!
Now more than ever, words matter.  Writing has the power to cut through harsh rhetoric and polarizing discourse. Novelists and poets connect readers across boundaries and cultures, while courageous journalists expose the truth. By identifying and encouraging the best new writers and by bringing them together in a community of peers, Under the Volcano continues to play its part in building the global awareness so critical for our survival.  As a non-profit, we remain committed to making our program affordable to all qualified applicants. 
Why We Need to Raise $10,000 Now

We raised $9000 for scholarships at our fourth annual fundraiser in September, but we’re still $6000 short of the funds we need to bring another dozen wonderful writers who are waiting to hear whether we can help them with tuition or travel subsidies so they can join us.  We will also draw on this fund to offer modest stipends to a handful of local young people who will participate this year as interns, continuing the successful pilot we began three years ago, which has already seen hesitant high school graduates find the confidence to make the leap to college.
Why Under the Volcano?
A few of our recent alumni in their own words...
“The time I spent in Tepoztlán working on my novel was magical. It re-charged my batteries so that I could finally get through my first draft.”
                                                            Reyna Grande, Mexico and California
“The dream always is to feel that writing is your only job in life. At Under the Volcano that dream becomes real.”
                                                            Tim MacGhabban, Ireland
“Under the Volcano is not just about the writing. Never has a combination of place, people and program felt so powerful and inspiring.”
                                                            Natalie Hart, United Kingdom
“The journalism workshop opened my eyes to the possibility of thinking deeply about a subject and having a voice in the piece while still doing the job of reporter. It was an awakening for me personally but also something I could bring back to the Seattle Times and use in my work there.""
                                                            Tyrone Beason, Seattle
“I had been hungry for an opportunity to write in Mexico, my ancestral homeland. The energy of Tepoztlán nurtured my creative process and allowed me access to stories I’d forgotten.”
                                                            Norma Liliana Valdez, California
“When I was feeling overwhelmed at the sheer talent and accomplishments of the faculty, a fellow student said to me, 'The only difference between them and us is time.'”
                                                            Martha Morrison, Canada

More on Our Budget: Impact of the Earthquake
The September 19th earthquake caused extensive damage in Tepoztlán, our village base, and we’re still scrambling to shift some of the key events of this special season, our fifteenth, which will see the launch of our first anthology (see our perks list to get your copy!), the world premiere of a song cycle by composer Felipe Pérez Santiago (downloads & CD's also on our list of perks) and the exhibit and sale of a stunning silkscreen commissioned from Cuernavaca artist Cisco Jiménez (available in limited edition prints to donors on the high end of our list.)
The earthquake has also hit the budgets of our many Mexican participants, some of whom were forced to move and/or lost work. And it hit home. Promised support from the local sponsors for several of our planned projects, including the anthology, has not come through and we are looking at $2000 in printing costs that we had not anticipated.

Giving Back to Our Village
Finally, we would like to be able to contribute to the reconstruction work in Tepoztlán. The first $1.000 of this campaign will go to several groups already working in the village to help families whose houses were either destroyed or rendered uninhabitable by the quake and to rebuild the 16th century churches whose bell towers collapsed.  We will also contribute to the reconstruction of the village’s crown jewel, the historic Museo del Ex-Convento, where we have held so many memorable readings and events with writers including Grace Paley, Maureen Howard, Breyten Breytenbach, Carolyn Forché, Russell Banks, Jonathan Levi, Elena Poniatowska, Francisco Goldman, Jennifer Clement, Sandra Cisneros and, just last year, Luisa Valenzuela.
       
Moving Beyond 2018

A professional documentary about the program (projected cost of $500) and money for a part-time grant writer ($500 to get us off the ground) will help us secure multi-year corporate and/or foundation funding to build a sustainable structure for the future.

<h3><strong><i>It is with great pride that the National Museum of Nuclear Science &amp; History's staff and Board of Trustees announce that through generous support received through Indiegogo and donations that came directly to the museum, we have received the $110,000 to complete the restoration of the B-47E Stratojet!</i></strong></h3>
<h3>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>
<h3>Help bring an iconic piece of history back to life!</h3>
<p>The congressionally chartered, Smithsonian affiliated <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">National Museum of Nuclear Science &amp; History</a> - a non-profit museum located in Albuquerque, New Mexico - is restoring its iconic <strong>B-47E Stratojet, serial number 53-2280</strong>.</p>
<p>This restoration initiative is a special project within <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/support/operation-preservation-the-campaign-to-restore-the-planes/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Operation Preservation</a>, an ongoing campaign to repaint and refurbish the iconic aircraft in the National Museum of Nuclear Science &amp; History's nine-acre outdoor exhibit area, <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/see/exhibits/heritage-park/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Heritage Park</a>. </p>
<p>The museum's historic B-47E Stratojet - one of only 23 surviving B-47 airplanes in existence - has experienced the ravages of the Southwestern weather, and we would like to ask for your support in paying for the surface preparation and painting of the exterior of the aircraft. </p>
<p>By restoring the B-47E Stratojet, we hope to connect museum visitors - both present and future - with this pivotal piece of history, and celebrate its many contributions to the United States Air Force and modern day jet airliners.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522085898/zkojryxzmqiayu5newlq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The total restoration cost for this airplane is expected to be $110,000. A little less than half will be paid by this Indiegogo project. The money raised in this campaign will be used for the cosmetic restoration of the fuselage and wings on the aircraft. That is, to purchase the paint ($460) per gallon and primer ($300 per gallon), prepare the airplane's surface and then paint the fuselages and wings.</p>
<p><i>The reason why the primer and paint for this project are so expensive is the paint must last a long time.

<p>The B-47E will receive trim and insignia to look like a Strategic Air Command bomber from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s. Restoration of the aircraft will begin in Spring of 2018 under the supervision of Brigadier General (Ret.) Jay Bledsoe, Restoration Project Manager, with the help from museum staff and volunteers. Jay has successfully managed the restoration of two of the museum's other airplanes, the <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/support/operation-preservation-the-campaign-to-restore-the-planes/f-105d-thunderchief-restoration/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">F-105D Thunderchief</a> and the <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/support/operation-preservation-the-campaign-to-restore-the-planes/a-7-corsair-ii-restoration/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A-7 Corsair II</a>.</p>
<p>With a quickly approaching target completion date for the restoration of the B-47E of August, 2018, we ask you to please consider becoming a member of the National Museum of Nuclear Science &amp; History's B-47E Stratojet Restoration Team by making a donation through Indiegogo!

<h3>About the B-47E Stratojet</h3>

<p style=""margin-left:9.35pt;text-align: center;""><strong><i>A flight line of B-47Es on a SAC base.</i></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:9.35pt;"">The B-47 Stratojet, with a wing span of 116 feet, was a long-range, six-engine, jet-powered strategic bomber designed to fly at high subsonic speeds and at high altitudes to avoid enemy interception. The B-47's mission was primarily to deliver nuclear ordnance on designated targets. With its engines carried in pods under the swept wing, the B-47 was a major innovation in post-World War II combat jet design and helped lead to modern jet airliners.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:9.35pt;"">The B-47 never saw combat as a bomber, but it was a mainstay of the United States Air Force’s Strategic Air Command’s (SAC) strength during the 1950s and early 1960s, and it remained in use as a bomber until 1965. It was also adapted to a number of other missions, including photo reconnaissance, electronic intelligence and weather reconnaissance, remaining in service as a reconnaissance platform until 1969 and as a test bed until 1977.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:9.35pt;"">The B-47E – the type of aircraft located at the National Museum of Nuclear Science &amp; History - was an improved version of the B model and more than 1,500 were produced by Boeing, Douglas and Lockheed. Improvements incorporated into the E model Stratojet included a more powerful version of the General Electric J47 turbojet and Rocket Assisted Take Off packs with 18 or 33 rockets that were jettisoned after use. Other features of the B-47E included 20mm cannons in the tail instead of the .50-cal. machine guns of the B model and upgraded avionics.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:9.35pt;"">The National Museum of Nuclear Science &amp; History’s B-47E Stratojet – on permanent loan from the National Museum of the United States Air Force (USAF) - came out of the Boeing, Wichita, Kansas plant on March 1<sup>st</sup> 1955. The aircraft served most of its operational life as a test bed for modern “fly-by-wire” (FBW) systems. This system replaced conventional manual flight controls of an aircraft with an electronic interface. The B-47E was removed from inventory at Wright Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio, in 1969 and was transferred to the USAF Heritage Museum program where it stayed until 2003. It was then moved into storage outside the museum’s restoration hangars until it was moved from Dayton, Ohio, to the National Museum of Nuclear Science &amp; History in August of 2013.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Our museum's A-7 Corsair II after restoration.</i></strong></p>
<p>The most current example of the museum's aircraft restoration work can be seen in last year's <i>Operation Preservation</i> project that involved restoring our <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/support/operation-preservation-the-campaign-to-restore-the-planes/f-105d-thunderchief-restoration/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">F-105D Thunderchief</a> and the <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/support/operation-preservation-the-campaign-to-restore-the-planes/a-7-corsair-ii-restoration/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A-7 Corsair II</a>. Our museum's historic F-105D Thunderchief is a supersonic fighter-bomber that was sent to Germany to provide NATO nuclear retaliation capability during the depths of the Cold War, and the museum's A-7 Corsair II is one of the Navy's most capable attack aircraft that is also the only aircraft in the museum's collection to have ever flown in combat missions.</p>
<p>Restoration of the two aircraft began in April of 2017 under the supervision of Restoration Project Coordinator, Brigadier General (Ret.) Jay Bledsoe, with help from museum staff and volunteers and was funded by donations received from supporters and entities with personal ties to the Museum and the historic aircraft. The museum also successfully raised over $45,000 through multiple initiatives, including an Indiegogo campaign, special events and generous support from donors and organizations. </p>
<p>Restoration included the F-105D Thunderchief and the A-7 Corsair II receiving bodywork and new coats of primer and paint. Completion of these outdoor exhibits for visitor viewing took place in Winter of 2018. </p>

<p>This truly historic object, measuring 30 feet high by nine feet wide and weighing 53 tons, was acquired by the Museum in 1999, and restoration began in the spring of 2014. Named after the 11th president of the United States, the USS James K. Polk was commissioned as SSBN 645 in 1966. The James K Polk was later converted into an attack submarine and re-designated SSN 645, making for an illustrious 33-year career.</p>
<p>Under the supervision of Frank Fernando, retired Process Engineer from Intel, and with help from Museum staff, volunteers and various partners, the submarine exhibit was a hub of activity throughout the summer of 2014. The completed submarine sail is now on permanent display in the Museum’s Heritage Park.</p>

<h3>The Excitement</h3>
<p><i>""Our B-47E is an example of the world's first swept wing jet-powered aircraft and the innovations that were created when it was invented are still with us. The B-47 represents the early jet age and the higher alert of our world during the cold war.​ It is with great excitement we move forward with this huge restoration."" <strong>- Museum Executive Director, Jim Walther</strong></i></p>
<p><i>""I love to see our airplanes returned to their former glory! Our B-47 is an iconic airplane; a strategic nuclear bomber that was flown at high altitude and subsonic speed by the United States Air Force Strategic Air Command. Of the 2032 Stratojets built by Boeing, only 23 survive today. Our aircraft restoration projects are an exciting way to motivate children and adults to be excited about history, science, technology, engineering and math."" <strong>- Museum Registrar, Sandy Fye</strong></i></p>
<p><i>""Some of my earliest recollections, beside chasing after various desert creatures, playing in our back yard grass, and gathering with multiple neighborhood kids to play, include watching the entire wing of USAF’s 303rd Bomb Wing, flying B-47’s based at Davis Monthan AFB, sequentially start engines, squadron-by-squadron and takeoff for a long deployment. Since my father was the navigator of one of these beasts, scheduled to deploy with the entire wing to Guam for training, my mother took me and my siblings to the base to watch the mass departure.</i></p>
<p><i>Other wives and mothers were likewise attending while stewarding their charges as congruently as my Mom and in the same viewing area set up for this event. And what a spectacle it was! Each of the three squadrons had a different colored stripe on the tail, to denote that squadron, added color to the show. Start-up sounds of the 270 engines of the 45 aircraft were deafening. Slowly but deliberately, the sleek bombers taxied out to the runway for takeoff. One jet at a time, the silver-colored spears rolled down the long runway, eventually lifting off, trailing six streams of black smoke as they followed one after the other, roaring into the distant Arizona morning sky. Jet after silver jet blasted down the runway, lifting and following the same path to join together many miles away and far from our sight.</i></p>
<p><i>Perhaps this is one reason I decided to become a USAF pilot many years later, flying into this same grey-blue sky; off to adventure, challenge, and danger, just as these B-47 crews did some 30 years before, I was flying jets that only a vivid imagination could conjure back in 1957. The B-47’s were retired many years ago, yet the B-47 still holds a vivid and special place in my memory."" <strong>- Jay Bledsoe, Brig Gen, USAF (Ret)​</strong></i></p>

<h3>Your Support, Our Gratitude</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522789175/xtbjqazurle0xp490cub.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The National Museum of Nuclear Science &amp; History staff, Board of Trustees and volunteers all passionately believe in the mission of our museum, and we know its past and future success depends on the generosity of our donors, volunteers and supporters.  Our heartfelt thanks go out to all of you.</p>
<p><i>Operation Preservation, The Campaign to Restore the Planes in Heritage Park</i> is a massive undertaking, with the B-47E Stratojet being only one of the seven aircraft needing to be restored.  It would be impossible for the museum to consider such a project without the confidence that generous donors will supply the bulk of the funding, and generous volunteers will supply the thousands of man-hours necessary to restore the aircraft. </p>
<p>Thank you all.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The largest risk to this project is in not having the aircraft sufficiently restored so that it can be dedicated in the Fall of 2018. At a minimum, this means the aircraft must be fully painted. For this to happen, the funding must be secured, the body work must be completed, the primer and paint applied and insignias painted.</p>
<p>Mitigation strategies that have been put in place include a schedule that includes time for unknowns such as weather and fluctuation in manpower. In addition, work to secure funds and manpower was started in mid-2017.</p>
<p>Overall, there is little risk that the project will not be completed. The restoration of the B-47E Stratojet is the museum's top priority in 2018, and the museum has an excellent track record of completing aircraft projects. The largest, completed between 2009 and 2011, was the relocation of all aircraft and other Heritage Park exhibits from the museum's first home, when it was located on Kirtland Air Force Base, to its current location. More recently, the museum successfully completed the full restoration of the <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/support/operation-preservation-the-campaign-to-restore-the-planes/f-105d-thunderchief-restoration/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">F-105D Thunderchief</a>, the <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/support/operation-preservation-the-campaign-to-restore-the-planes/a-7-corsair-ii-restoration/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A-7 Corsair II</a>, the <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/support/operation-preservation-the-campaign-to-restore-the-planes/b-52b-stratofortress-restoration-project/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">B-52B Stratofortress</a>, the <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/support/operation-preservation-the-campaign-to-restore-the-planes/b-29-restoration-project/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">B-29 Superfortress</a>, the <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/support/operation-preservation-the-campaign-to-restore-the-planes/completed-f-16-fighting-falcon/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">F-16 Fighting Falcon</a> and the <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/support/operation-preservation-the-campaign-to-restore-the-planes/completed-sub-sail-restoration/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">USS James K.

</div></div>","It is with great pride that the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History's staff and Board of Trustees announce that through generous support received through Indiegogo and donations that came directly to the museum, we have received the $110,000 to complete the restoration of the B-47E Stratojet!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help bring an iconic piece of history back to life!
The congressionally chartered, Smithsonian affiliated National Museum of Nuclear Science & History - a non-profit museum located in Albuquerque, New Mexico - is restoring its iconic B-47E Stratojet, serial number 53-2280.
This restoration initiative is a special project within Operation Preservation, an ongoing campaign to repaint and refurbish the iconic aircraft in the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History's nine-acre outdoor exhibit area, Heritage Park. 
The museum's historic B-47E Stratojet - one of only 23 surviving B-47 airplanes in existence - has experienced the ravages of the Southwestern weather, and we would like to ask for your support in paying for the surface preparation and painting of the exterior of the aircraft. 
By restoring the B-47E Stratojet, we hope to connect museum visitors - both present and future - with this pivotal piece of history, and celebrate its many contributions to the United States Air Force and modern day jet airliners.


The total restoration cost for this airplane is expected to be $110,000. A little less than half will be paid by this Indiegogo project. The money raised in this campaign will be used for the cosmetic restoration of the fuselage and wings on the aircraft. That is, to purchase the paint ($460) per gallon and primer ($300 per gallon), prepare the airplane's surface and then paint the fuselages and wings.
The reason why the primer and paint for this project are so expensive is the paint must last a long time. In the Southwest region of the United States, normal paint or even MilSpec paint is only good for 3-5 years. The NAPA premium automotive primer and finish we will use is guaranteed for 15-20 years. In addition, we must choose a paint and a color that is approved by the United States Air Force and other museum entities.

The B-47E will receive trim and insignia to look like a Strategic Air Command bomber from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s. Restoration of the aircraft will begin in Spring of 2018 under the supervision of Brigadier General (Ret.) Jay Bledsoe, Restoration Project Manager, with the help from museum staff and volunteers. Jay has successfully managed the restoration of two of the museum's other airplanes, the F-105D Thunderchief and the A-7 Corsair II.
With a quickly approaching target completion date for the restoration of the B-47E of August, 2018, we ask you to please consider becoming a member of the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History's B-47E Stratojet Restoration Team by making a donation through Indiegogo! As a part of this support team, you will personally help in the preservation of this iconic airplane.

 
About the B-47E Stratojet

A flight line of B-47Es on a SAC base.
The B-47 Stratojet, with a wing span of 116 feet, was a long-range, six-engine, jet-powered strategic bomber designed to fly at high subsonic speeds and at high altitudes to avoid enemy interception. The B-47's mission was primarily to deliver nuclear ordnance on designated targets. With its engines carried in pods under the swept wing, the B-47 was a major innovation in post-World War II combat jet design and helped lead to modern jet airliners.
The B-47 never saw combat as a bomber, but it was a mainstay of the United States Air Force’s Strategic Air Command’s (SAC) strength during the 1950s and early 1960s, and it remained in use as a bomber until 1965. It was also adapted to a number of other missions, including photo reconnaissance, electronic intelligence and weather reconnaissance, remaining in service as a reconnaissance platform until 1969 and as a test bed until 1977.

The B-47E – the type of aircraft located at the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History - was an improved version of the B model and more than 1,500 were produced by Boeing, Douglas and Lockheed. Improvements incorporated into the E model Stratojet included a more powerful version of the General Electric J47 turbojet and Rocket Assisted Take Off packs with 18 or 33 rockets that were jettisoned after use. Other features of the B-47E included 20mm cannons in the tail instead of the .50-cal. machine guns of the B model and upgraded avionics.
The National Museum of Nuclear Science & History’s B-47E Stratojet – on permanent loan from the National Museum of the United States Air Force (USAF) - came out of the Boeing, Wichita, Kansas plant on March 1st 1955. The aircraft served most of its operational life as a test bed for modern “fly-by-wire” (FBW) systems. This system replaced conventional manual flight controls of an aircraft with an electronic interface. The B-47E was removed from inventory at Wright Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio, in 1969 and was transferred to the USAF Heritage Museum program where it stayed until 2003. It was then moved into storage outside the museum’s restoration hangars until it was moved from Dayton, Ohio, to the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History in August of 2013.

The National Museum of Nuclear Science & History successfully completed the restoration of the iconic USS James K. Polk SSN 645 nuclear submarine sail in the fall of 2014.
This truly historic object, measuring 30 feet high by nine feet wide and weighing 53 tons, was acquired by the Museum in 1999, and restoration began in the spring of 2014. Named after the 11th president of the United States, the USS James K. Polk was commissioned as SSBN 645 in 1966. The James K Polk was later converted into an attack submarine and re-designated SSN 645, making for an illustrious 33-year career.
Under the supervision of Frank Fernando, retired Process Engineer from Intel, and with help from Museum staff, volunteers and various partners, the submarine exhibit was a hub of activity throughout the summer of 2014. The completed submarine sail is now on permanent display in the Museum’s Heritage Park.
 

The Excitement
""Our B-47E is an example of the world's first swept wing jet-powered aircraft and the innovations that were created when it was invented are still with us. The B-47 represents the early jet age and the higher alert of our world during the cold war.​ It is with great excitement we move forward with this huge restoration."" - Museum Executive Director, Jim Walther
""I love to see our airplanes returned to their former glory! Our B-47 is an iconic airplane; a strategic nuclear bomber that was flown at high altitude and subsonic speed by the United States Air Force Strategic Air Command. Of the 2032 Stratojets built by Boeing, only 23 survive today. Our aircraft restoration projects are an exciting way to motivate children and adults to be excited about history, science, technology, engineering and math."" - Museum Registrar, Sandy Fye
""Some of my earliest recollections, beside chasing after various desert creatures, playing in our back yard grass, and gathering with multiple neighborhood kids to play, include watching the entire wing of USAF’s 303rd Bomb Wing, flying B-47’s based at Davis Monthan AFB, sequentially start engines, squadron-by-squadron and takeoff for a long deployment. Since my father was the navigator of one of these beasts, scheduled to deploy with the entire wing to Guam for training, my mother took me and my siblings to the base to watch the mass departure.
Other wives and mothers were likewise attending while stewarding their charges as congruently as my Mom and in the same viewing area set up for this event. And what a spectacle it was! Each of the three squadrons had a different colored stripe on the tail, to denote that squadron, added color to the show. Start-up sounds of the 270 engines of the 45 aircraft were deafening. Slowly but deliberately, the sleek bombers taxied out to the runway for takeoff. One jet at a time, the silver-colored spears rolled down the long runway, eventually lifting off, trailing six streams of black smoke as they followed one after the other, roaring into the distant Arizona morning sky. Jet after silver jet blasted down the runway, lifting and following the same path to join together many miles away and far from our sight.
Perhaps this is one reason I decided to become a USAF pilot many years later, flying into this same grey-blue sky; off to adventure, challenge, and danger, just as these B-47 crews did some 30 years before, I was flying jets that only a vivid imagination could conjure back in 1957. The B-47’s were retired many years ago, yet the B-47 still holds a vivid and special place in my memory."" - Jay Bledsoe, Brig Gen, USAF (Ret)​
 

Your Support, Our Gratitude

The National Museum of Nuclear Science & History staff, Board of Trustees and volunteers all passionately believe in the mission of our museum, and we know its past and future success depends on the generosity of our donors, volunteers and supporters.  Our heartfelt thanks go out to all of you.
Operation Preservation, The Campaign to Restore the Planes in Heritage Park is a massive undertaking, with the B-47E Stratojet being only one of the seven aircraft needing to be restored.  It would be impossible for the museum to consider such a project without the confidence that generous donors will supply the bulk of the funding, and generous volunteers will supply the thousands of man-hours necessary to restore the aircraft. 
Thank you all.
 

Risks & Challenges
The largest risk to this project is in not having the aircraft sufficiently restored so that it can be dedicated in the Fall of 2018. At a minimum, this means the aircraft must be fully painted. For this to happen, the funding must be secured, the body work must be completed, the primer and paint applied and insignias painted.
Mitigation strategies that have been put in place include a schedule that includes time for unknowns such as weather and fluctuation in manpower. In addition, work to secure funds and manpower was started in mid-2017.
Overall, there is little risk that the project will not be completed. The restoration of the B-47E Stratojet is the museum's top priority in 2018, and the museum has an excellent track record of completing aircraft projects. The largest, completed between 2009 and 2011, was the relocation of all aircraft and other Heritage Park exhibits from the museum's first home, when it was located on Kirtland Air Force Base, to its current location. More recently, the museum successfully completed the full restoration of the F-105D Thunderchief, the A-7 Corsair II, the B-52B Stratofortress, the B-29 Superfortress, the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the USS James K. Polk SSN 645 nuclear submarine sail.

<p></p>The 'Black Queens Matter' campaign was created and founded by Music Artist and Video Director Ridock King (<a href=""http://www.ridockking.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ridockking.com</a>), this campaign will help raise funds for the female enrichment organization ""Beaute' Within"" as well as for a music and film project inspired by the need to have a positive impact on young black girls. 
<br/>There is a significant need for positive role models in the lives of young black girls, some of the radio and media messages can be very misleading. It is time that we take it upon ourselves to encourage young black girls that they are queens and that there lies within them the potential to help bring about positive societal change. <br/>Black Queens Matter is not an exclusion of any other race of girls, but it is an emphasis on the urgent needs of young black girls. We believe all girls require encouragement, mentoring, and assistance, but we feel it is very necessary to focus on black girls. There are voids that are left within the black community from various issues ranging from 'no father in home' to 'lack of resources.' The family plays a key role in the success or failure of these young girls but we all understand that things happen and sometimes a black girl may not have a dependable family. <br/><p>We are fortunate to have organizations that will help with encouraging, mentoring and assisting young girls. Black girls deserve a fair shot, we understand that there is an incomparable amount of pressure on families and schools to help these young girls realize their full potential. As the old saying goes ""it takes a village to raise a child"" it will take organizations, artists, and visionaries working together to see that young black girls understand that they too matter! <br/></p>
<br/><p>All donations given will go towards the Black Queens Matter campaign to help with expenses for female enrichment organization, and for special projects designed for the same cause. There are several perks for donations, depending on the amount given:</p>

</li>
<br/> <li>We are very optimistic about this campaign and we know that with the right support there is no doubt we will reach our goal. Most of us believe that now is the time to bring about real change instead of simply complaining and discussing this change. We have been hearing and speaking about it for quite a while and now is the time, you as a supporter will now have the opportunity to help induce this change, and be a part of something greater than our individual selves. If we do not reach our goal the campaign ends and there is a 9% charge on total amount raised and there are no refunds given to donors. If that happens we will have let down many young women who deserve better. However, we are extremely optimistic that such will not be the case, and that your will and tenacity to help bring about real change to our community will ultimately be unmatched. We will meet our goal because we all agree that black queens matter. <br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul> <li>As a contributor and supporter of this campaign you will have played a major part in the cultivation of real positive change for young women, and like many of us you are probably thinking that now is the perfect time. </li> <li>As an artist I have continuously challenged the status quo and creatively engineered visually and through audio a different perspective, a perfect example of this would be my song and music video titled ""Oshun"".</li> <li>You can count on this campaign to deliver, but the bigger question is can those young women count on you to deliver, this is not about any one individual, but this is much bigger and this opportunity has the potential to save many young lives. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <ul> <li>Like many things in life this campaign will not be easy, but with the proper support we will make this happen. </li>
<li>We will use all possible avenues of promotion and out-reach so that we may help exhaust any and all potential to come up short of our goal. </li>

Black Queens Matter is not an exclusion of any other race of girls, but it is an emphasis on the urgent needs of young black girls. We believe all girls require encouragement, mentoring, and assistance, but we feel it is very necessary to focus on black girls. There are voids that are left within the black community from various issues ranging from 'no father in home' to 'lack of resources.' The family plays a key role in the success or failure of these young girls but we all understand that things happen and sometimes a black girl may not have a dependable family. We are fortunate to have organizations that will help with encouraging, mentoring and assisting young girls. Black girls deserve a fair shot, we understand that there is an incomparable amount of pressure on families and schools to help these young girls realize their full potential. As the old saying goes ""it takes a village to raise a child"" it will take organizations, artists, and visionaries working together to see that young black girls understand that they too matter! 
All donations given will go towards the Black Queens Matter campaign to help with expenses for female enrichment organization, and for special projects designed for the same cause. There are several perks for donations, depending on the amount given:

   What We Need & What You Get  This campaign will require funding. The expenses incurred will be as followed: 

Film Project = $1500
'Beaute Within' Expenses (Travel, Food, Supplies, young women empowerment events, guest speakers) = $1800
Marketing and Promotion = $400
Production Equipment and Software = $425
Expense Total = $4125
Total Needed to Raise = $2500
 For those who may be interested in receiving a perk for donations, we have generated a list of perks: (Each perk also includes the previous perk(s) listed)

Premiere of film DVD = $30.00

Special thank you email = $55.00
T-Shirt (Black Queens Matter, or Dream, Plan, Execute) = $100.00
2 tickets to empowerment event = $150.00
Special thanks at end of film = $250.00 

Invitation to appear in film (great opportunity to expose your brand) = $325.00
Executive director credit = $400.00 

Personalized poem and song by Ridock King (Topic of your choice) = $475.00 

 We are very optimistic about this campaign and we know that with the right support there is no doubt we will reach our goal. Most of us believe that now is the time to bring about real change instead of simply complaining and discussing this change. We have been hearing and speaking about it for quite a while and now is the time, you as a supporter will now have the opportunity to help induce this change, and be a part of something greater than our individual selves. If we do not reach our goal the campaign ends and there is a 9% charge on total amount raised and there are no refunds given to donors. If that happens we will have let down many young women who deserve better. However, we are extremely optimistic that such will not be the case, and that your will and tenacity to help bring about real change to our community will ultimately be unmatched. We will meet our goal because we all agree that black queens matter. 
    The Impact  As a contributor and supporter of this campaign you will have played a major part in the cultivation of real positive change for young women, and like many of us you are probably thinking that now is the perfect time.  As an artist I have continuously challenged the status quo and creatively engineered visually and through audio a different perspective, a perfect example of this would be my song and music video titled ""Oshun"". You can count on this campaign to deliver, but the bigger question is can those young women count on you to deliver, this is not about any one individual, but this is much bigger and this opportunity has the potential to save many young lives.     Risks & Challenges  Like many things in life this campaign will not be easy, but with the proper support we will make this happen. 
We will use all possible avenues of promotion and out-reach so that we may help exhaust any and all potential to come up short of our goal. 

Other Ways You Can Help

Founded in 1999 and recognized as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization in the United States, People to  People (P2P) is a non-governmental, non-profit organization dedicated to improving health care and reducing the spread of diseases, particularly in Ethiopia and in diaspora communities.   There are currently more than 5,000 P2P members worldwide, including doctors and other professionals who strive to make a difference in the lives of others.  Our network stands ready to take on many of the challenges facing communities and institutions in Ethiopia and elsewhere.
P2P’s projects are focused on strengthening health systems through partnerships with local hospitals and universities, in which we engage the global Ethiopian diaspora in an attempt to bridge the knowledge gap and address the country’s severe shortage of health and medical professionals.  P2P is also engaged in a number of service-oriented projects, working in particular with vulnerable  communities, such as children orphaned by HIV/AIDS, the elderly, the deaf community, women, and more, devoting our time and effort to their overall health and empowerment.
   How your funding will support P2P
People to People (P2P) stands uniquely poised to undertake meaningful development work in Ethiopia and help to address the many challenges faced by its resilient people.  People to Peoples (P2P) vision is in developing Ethiopia’s human resources capital, health care and education thereby bringing Ethiopia  truly into the 21st century. 
People to People (P2P) and The Network of Ethiopian diaspora healthcare Professionals announce the  7Th Annual Global Ethiopian Diaspora conference on Health Care and Medical Education.  Saturday, September 26th 2015 in The Washington, DC metro Area.  Key Topics will include:


Disaster Management and Response  (Focus on the Ebola Epidemic Management)
Injury and Trauma in the Ethiopian Setting
New Licensure Exam and requirements for medical school graduates and physicians in Ethiopia
Diaspora Partnership projects relevant to Ethiopia
Abstract and Poster Presentations on health related topics relevant to Ethiopia


Your help to P2P will allow cover the following expenses: 



Travel  expense for staff, special guests, foreign attendees
Pay for  accommodations.
Rent for  conference facility (Venue Rental, equipment and etc)

P2P is very proud that this annual event, which was started amid lots of uncertainties, is turning out to be the go to conference for those who are collaborating with Ethiopian healthcare institutions.  In addition, it is serving as a successful venue for bringing together Ethiopian Diaspora Health Care professionals to discuss and debate issues relevant to Health Care and medical Education in Ethiopia.  It is also serving as means of connecting the Diaspora with Ethiopian Health Care Institutions and  facilitating the transfer of knowledge, technology and investment.

   
Risks & Challenges

  
Improving  the health, education, and success of millions of people entangled in poverty, particularly in Ethiopia is a daunting task however  the magnitude of the problem is not a valid reason to shy away from what may feel like overwhelming circumstances. There is fear and uncertainty struck in the hearts of all those who have been and are affected by sickness and poverty.  It's our responsibility to  provide   them with the tools and resources they need to succeed – both of which they are unable to obtain by their own means.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Our Backstory?</h2>
<p>I couldn't stand product fundraisers as a child. I didn't have family members that were able <i>or willing </i>to buy tons of product from the catalogs I brought home. My single mother often felt obligated to purchase something so that I could get the prizes that we were ""sold on"". Even as a kid I realized that they were never worth the money. Then in track I sold chocolate in the summers in the hood and honestly my friends and I ate way more melted chocolate than we sold. Then our parents had to bail us out by paying the difference. When my younger sisters were in elementary YEARS later I saw them come home with the same old catalogs. When neighborhood kids came looking for school support I was more willing and able to give money, but I wished there was an easy way for me to give directly to their school and I didn't trust giving cash that could be lost or used at the corner store. Now as the parents of a first grader, we are faced with the need for fundraisers again at our local school. It is time to take real action. Chikamon is a company that we feel really good about representing. No more products I don't want or need, Supporting schools and parent groups directly. Products that make teachers feel amazing!</p>

<p> 
My name is Pastor Joshua Laizer, I am 44 years old, born in Naisinyai village,
Simanjiro district in Tanzania. I got chance to join evangelical college for
four years and served as an evangelist for seven years. Later on I joined the
university of Makumira for theology, after my graduation, I was blessed
installed  to be a pastor among Maasai society. I have been a pastor for
the Maasai in Lutheran church Northern diocese constituency of Siha in Karansi
Kilimanjaro.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466679905/12_zpiave.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i><b>Pastor Joshua Laiser (Karansi Lutheran Parish in Moshi Tanzania)</b></i><p><i><b></b></i><br/></p>
<p> <b> 
MY CAMPAIGN AND WHY IT IS IMPORTANT</b><br/></p><p>I,
as pastor of Maasai society where education is of low standard and inadequate,
I decided to start a school in Maasai society so as to convince the Maasai on
Education. Maasai society is leaving a life with no permanent settlement, thus
not getting a chance for schooling. Also the society lives a life of animal
husbandry which is difficult for parents to allow their children in distant
schools due to they depend of them for rearing animals. Therefore starting a
school within Maasai society will convince parents allowing their children to
attend school near by them. That is the school I started within Maasai society
is purposely to help the Maasai children. It is called PAMBAZUKA NAISINYAI PRE &amp;
PRIMARY SCHOOL. Already my school has grade one (1) with 65 pupils and grade two with 35 pupils and 4
teachers who use most of their time teaching the children for most of them
can’t speak neither Swahili nor English, but Maasai language. <br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466681016/15_kanesd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i><b>Pupils with their teachers</b></i><br/></p><p>Our school started under the tree as we do not have resources to help us for building classes for the Maasai children. Education should start with their parents to educate them so that they can know the importance of education to their children. Some of the parents are now aware about education to their children so they are allowing them to attend school. We are still talking to the parents so that they can give us a good cooperation.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466680519/4_yhenr1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i><b>Pupils with their teacher <br/></b></i><p><i><b></b></i><br/></p><p> <b>NEW TWO CLASSES</b><br/></p><p>Through our own efforts we have managed to build two classes where grade one and two are using for studying. We have more 10 acres where we want to build more classes as we have more students coming soon. We want to build more classes up to seven classes, we also need to build kitchen, toilet as the one we have is not enough, computers and computer lab, well for keeping water as there is scarcity of water, desks, books, office for teachers, salaries for teachers.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466682907/DSC_0461_g8qekl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i><b>Our two New Classes</b></i><br/><p>
My future
plans are to have secondary school up to university among Maasai society in
order to have education nearby so as to fight poverty by getting good
education.</p>
<p> 
The importance of this campaign is to construct a school within Maasai society,
also helping Maasai society withdraw from ignorance and illiteracy so a t cope

My name is Pastor Joshua Laizer, I am 44 years old, born in Naisinyai village,
Simanjiro district in Tanzania. I got chance to join evangelical college for
four years and served as an evangelist for seven years. Later on I joined the
university of Makumira for theology, after my graduation, I was blessed
installed  to be a pastor among Maasai society. I have been a pastor for
the Maasai in Lutheran church Northern diocese constituency of Siha in Karansi
Kilimanjaro.Pastor Joshua Laiser (Karansi Lutheran Parish in Moshi Tanzania)
  
MY CAMPAIGN AND WHY IT IS IMPORTANTI,
as pastor of Maasai society where education is of low standard and inadequate,
I decided to start a school in Maasai society so as to convince the Maasai on
Education. Maasai society is leaving a life with no permanent settlement, thus
not getting a chance for schooling. Also the society lives a life of animal
husbandry which is difficult for parents to allow their children in distant
schools due to they depend of them for rearing animals. Therefore starting a
school within Maasai society will convince parents allowing their children to
attend school near by them. That is the school I started within Maasai society
is purposely to help the Maasai children. It is called PAMBAZUKA NAISINYAI PRE &
PRIMARY SCHOOL. Already my school has grade one (1) with 65 pupils and grade two with 35 pupils and 4
teachers who use most of their time teaching the children for most of them
can’t speak neither Swahili nor English, but Maasai language. Pupils with their teachersOur school started under the tree as we do not have resources to help us for building classes for the Maasai children. Education should start with their parents to educate them so that they can know the importance of education to their children. Some of the parents are now aware about education to their children so they are allowing them to attend school. We are still talking to the parents so that they can give us a good cooperation.Pupils with their teacher  NEW TWO CLASSESThrough our own efforts we have managed to build two classes where grade one and two are using for studying. We have more 10 acres where we want to build more classes as we have more students coming soon. We want to build more classes up to seven classes, we also need to build kitchen, toilet as the one we have is not enough, computers and computer lab, well for keeping water as there is scarcity of water, desks, books, office for teachers, salaries for teachers.Our two New Classes
My future
plans are to have secondary school up to university among Maasai society in
order to have education nearby so as to fight poverty by getting good
education.
 
The importance of this campaign is to construct a school within Maasai society,
also helping Maasai society withdraw from ignorance and illiteracy so a t cope
with the changes of the world.
What We Need & What You Get
We need to do the following so that we can get our school off the ground;Seven (7) more classes @ $5000 x 7 =    $35000Computer room 1......................................= $5000Thirty (30) computers @ $500 x 30.....=$15000One office for teachers ..........................=$5000Kitchen....................................................= $5000Toilet........................................................= $5000Library & books......................................= $9000Well for keeping water(waterhole)........= $3000Lunch
for 100 students  $1000 per month * 12 months =$12,000Salaries for 4 teachers @ $300 x 12 x 4 = $14400 
Tuition
fees for 25 students who their parents can not afford to pay for them @ $700 x 25  =$17500Total Expansions Costs.......................... $125,900
THE FOLLOWING ARE THE REASONS AS TO WHY MY PROJECT IS VALUABLE TO DONORS AND THE WORLD  This project is very important to donors and world at large for it will connect us with Maasai society for they shall be able to communicate with different people of different nations of the world. Also this will give chance for donors to come and visit Maasai society and learn the real life and culture of Maasai. Apart from that it also helps to eradicate the number of illiterates in the world.RISKS AND CHALLENGES1. Due to studying environment being of low standard life, it is difficult to get skilled teachers and faithful constructors.2. Another challenge is teacher's salaries, where by in order to get good trainers you also have to pay them well.3. Another challenge is that , the pupils are fluently speaking Maasai native language, while their teachers don’t know the language and thus difficult to teach them4. Due to that parents couldn’t get education, and then they find no importance to take their children to school. HOW TO OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES1. Improving the teaching environment so as to encourage trained teachers to come and teach in our school. Also getting enough trusted constructors for constructing the building.2. Increasing teacher's salaries so as to motivate the coming of more teachers.3. Educating parents’ house by house on the importance of taking their children to school.Other Ways You Can Help

<p><i><strong>An old glorious Nation kept in chains</strong></i></p>
<p><i>Sicily is one of the oldest nations in the world still alive.<br/>It experimented the Great Classical Civilization (Siceliot Era): Greek-Roman Sicily lasted since 743 b.C until 903 a.D.<br/>After the relatively brief Arabic domination it was the turn of the Kingdom of Sicily (1060-1860), a Great Power in Middle Ages, where it founded Parliament before the same England; after, a little kingdom in Modern Era, but still independent and alive.<br/>Illegal occupation by Italy reduced the richest country in Mediterranean Area to a sad and poor colony. <br/>Now, despite a formal autonomy never respected by Rome, the situation is worsening day by day, the old nation is nearly killed by a hard theft of all its resources.</i></p>
<p><i><strong>Some numbers of the disaster</strong></i></p>
<p><i>From the Ancient times to 1860 never migrated from Sicily; since 1860 10 millions Sicilians left Sicily, more than Armenians or Palestinians, or Hebrews: a silent genocide.<br/>GNP is today nearly 80 billions of euros, but with 60 % of youth unemployment; full employment GNP would be at least the double. GNP per capita under the 2/3 of Italian Average, ¾ of Economy owned by the public sector, ¼ public pensions.<br/>Sicily pays in taxes and tariffs to Italy nearly 1/8 of its GNP without receiving anything by Italy.<br/>Sicily has no speed railways nor acceptable highways, nor true international ports or airports; all its infrastructures seems 50 or more years old.<br/>Sicily keeps 40% of Italian Cultural Heritage (on its turn the 60 % of the entire world) </i></p>
<p><strong><i>The only viable solution</i></strong></p>
<p><i>Time for the “false autonomous” regime is ended.<br/>Time for colonialism and assisted economy is ended.<br/>Historical attempt to belonging to Italy has failed miserably.<br/>Sicily must become an Independent State with a reliable ruling class. </i></p>

<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Un’antica gloriosa nazione tenuta in catene</strong><br/>La Sicilia è una delle più antiche nazioni del mondo ancora vivente.<br/>Ha vissuto la grande Civiltà Classica (l’Era Siceliota): la Sicilia Greco-Romana durò dal 743 a. C al 903 d. C.<br/>Dopo la relativamente breve dominazione araba fu la volta del Regno di Sicilia (1060-1860), una Grande Potenza nel Medio Evo, in cui essa fondò il Parlamento prima della stessa Inghilterra; dopo, un piccolo regno nell’Era Moderna, ma ancora indipendente e vivo.</i></p>
<p><i>L’occupazione illegale da parte dell’Italia ha reso il più ricco paese dell’Area mediterranea una colonia triste e povera.</i></p>
<p><i>Adesso, nonostante un’autonomia formale mai rispettata da Roma, la situazione peggiora giorno dopo giorno, l’antica nazione è quasi uccisa da un immane furto di tutte le sue risorse.</i></p>
<p><strong><i>Alcuni numeri del disastro</i></strong></p>
<p><i>Dall’Antichità sino al 1860 nessuno è mai emigrato dalla Sicilia; dal 1860 10 milioni di Siciliani hanno abbandonato la Sicilia, più che gli Armeni o i Palestinesi o gli Ebrei: un genocidio silenzioso.</i></p>
<p><i>Il PIL è oggi circa di 80 miliardi di euro, ma con il 60 % di disoccupazione giovanile; al pieno impiego il PIL sarebbe almeno il doppio. Il PIL pro capite al di sotto dei 2/3 della media italiana, i ¾ dell’economia occupati dal settore pubblico, ¼ dalle pensioni pubbliche.</i></p>
<p><i>La Sicilia paga in tributi e tariffe all’Italia circa 1/8 del proprio PIL senza ricevere nulla dall’Italia.</i></p>
<p><i>La Sicilia non ha treni veloci né strade decenti, né porti o aeroporti veramente internazionali; tutte le sue infrastrutture sembrano vecchie di 50 anni o più.</i></p>
<p><i>La Sicilia contiene il 40 % dei beni culturali italiani (a loro volta il 60 % di quelli mondiali).</i></p>
<p><strong><i>L’unica soluzione praticabile</i></strong></p>
<p><i>L’epoca del regime di “falsa autonomia” è terminata.</i></p>
<p><i>L’epoca del colonialismo e dell’economia assistita è finita.</i></p>

A summary by Massimo Costa (http://www.sicilianiliberi.org/it/) 

An old glorious Nation kept in chains
Sicily is one of the oldest nations in the world still alive.It experimented the Great Classical Civilization (Siceliot Era): Greek-Roman Sicily lasted since 743 b.C until 903 a.D.After the relatively brief Arabic domination it was the turn of the Kingdom of Sicily (1060-1860), a Great Power in Middle Ages, where it founded Parliament before the same England; after, a little kingdom in Modern Era, but still independent and alive.Illegal occupation by Italy reduced the richest country in Mediterranean Area to a sad and poor colony. Now, despite a formal autonomy never respected by Rome, the situation is worsening day by day, the old nation is nearly killed by a hard theft of all its resources.
Some numbers of the disaster
From the Ancient times to 1860 never migrated from Sicily; since 1860 10 millions Sicilians left Sicily, more than Armenians or Palestinians, or Hebrews: a silent genocide.GNP is today nearly 80 billions of euros, but with 60 % of youth unemployment; full employment GNP would be at least the double. GNP per capita under the 2/3 of Italian Average, ¾ of Economy owned by the public sector, ¼ public pensions.Sicily pays in taxes and tariffs to Italy nearly 1/8 of its GNP without receiving anything by Italy.Sicily has no speed railways nor acceptable highways, nor true international ports or airports; all its infrastructures seems 50 or more years old.Sicily keeps 40% of Italian Cultural Heritage (on its turn the 60 % of the entire world) 
The only viable solution
Time for the “false autonomous” regime is ended.Time for colonialism and assisted economy is ended.Historical attempt to belonging to Italy has failed miserably.Sicily must become an Independent State with a reliable ruling class. 
The features of our dream 

Owners at home: land, energy, cultural and environmental resources, sovereignty belong only to Sicilians and to their Free State.
A Revolution in transports, wealth services,…; in a word “Sicily as the motherland of Quality of Life”.
E-administration for every level and abolition of the colonial “bureaucracy” regime.
Lean management for public services.
Freedom and Incentives for foreigners’ investments.
Lowing taxes for income and VAT.
Free customs (out of a short list of agricultural and food products).
A model of development founded upon tourism, quality food, culture and high-tech, no carbon industries.

A Strategy for Sicilian Freedom
Foundation of a strong Sicilian Nationalist Party, rooted throughout Sicily (done, its name being “Siciliani Liberi”).Winning the next political “regional” elections (2017) or strongly conditioning the winners for a legislation (2017/22) and winning the next one.Organizing – after a max 5-years transition for restoring economy and society - a plebiscite for independence and opening negotiations with Italian State and European Union.Declaration of Independence of Sicily and Convoking of a Constituent Parliament.
The need for help by the Sicilians of the Diaspora
Sicilians in the world feel their “motherland” more than Sicilians at home.Only a domestic crowdfunding would be a too slow process: now Sicily is very poor and it cannot wait for a long-time lasting process of political liberation.Financing Sicilian Independence is not only right, but also convenient: a great and fresh chance for free investments in a free land.

Che cosa? Perché ? Come?
Una sintesi di: Massimo Costa
 
Un’antica gloriosa nazione tenuta in cateneLa Sicilia è una delle più antiche nazioni del mondo ancora vivente.Ha vissuto la grande Civiltà Classica (l’Era Siceliota): la Sicilia Greco-Romana durò dal 743 a. C al 903 d. C.Dopo la relativamente breve dominazione araba fu la volta del Regno di Sicilia (1060-1860), una Grande Potenza nel Medio Evo, in cui essa fondò il Parlamento prima della stessa Inghilterra; dopo, un piccolo regno nell’Era Moderna, ma ancora indipendente e vivo.
L’occupazione illegale da parte dell’Italia ha reso il più ricco paese dell’Area mediterranea una colonia triste e povera.
Adesso, nonostante un’autonomia formale mai rispettata da Roma, la situazione peggiora giorno dopo giorno, l’antica nazione è quasi uccisa da un immane furto di tutte le sue risorse.
Alcuni numeri del disastro
Dall’Antichità sino al 1860 nessuno è mai emigrato dalla Sicilia; dal 1860 10 milioni di Siciliani hanno abbandonato la Sicilia, più che gli Armeni o i Palestinesi o gli Ebrei: un genocidio silenzioso.
Il PIL è oggi circa di 80 miliardi di euro, ma con il 60 % di disoccupazione giovanile; al pieno impiego il PIL sarebbe almeno il doppio. Il PIL pro capite al di sotto dei 2/3 della media italiana, i ¾ dell’economia occupati dal settore pubblico, ¼ dalle pensioni pubbliche.
La Sicilia paga in tributi e tariffe all’Italia circa 1/8 del proprio PIL senza ricevere nulla dall’Italia.
La Sicilia non ha treni veloci né strade decenti, né porti o aeroporti veramente internazionali; tutte le sue infrastrutture sembrano vecchie di 50 anni o più.
La Sicilia contiene il 40 % dei beni culturali italiani (a loro volta il 60 % di quelli mondiali).
L’unica soluzione praticabile
L’epoca del regime di “falsa autonomia” è terminata.
L’epoca del colonialismo e dell’economia assistita è finita.
Il tentativo storico di far parte dell’Italia è fallito clamorosamente.
La Sicilia deve diventare uno Stato Indipendente con un’affidabile classe dirigente. 
I caratteri del nostro sogno

Padroni a casa propria: la terra, l’energia, le risorse culturali ed ambientali, la sovranità appartengano solo ai Siciliani e al loro Libero Stato.
Una rivoluzione nei trasporti, nei servizi sanitari,…; in una parola, “La Sicilia come la patria della Qualità della vita”.
E-administration ad ogni livello ed abolizione del regime “burocratico” coloniale.
Gestione snella dei servizi pubblici.
Libertà ed incentivi per gli investimenti stranieri.
Diminuzione della tassazione sul reddito e dell’IVA
Liberalizzazione doganale (tranne una lista di prodotti agricoli e alimentari)
Un modello di sviluppo fondato sul turismo, cibo di qualità, cultura e alta tecnologia, senza industrie inquinanti.

Una Strategia per la Liberazione della SiciliaFondazione di un forte partito nazionalista siciliano, radicato dappertutto in Sicilia (già fatto, il suo nome è “Siciliani Liberi”)
Vittoria alle prossime elezioni politiche “regionali” (2017) o risultato comunque in grado di condizionare i vincitori per una legislatura (2017/22) e vittoria definitiva alle elezioni successive.
Organizzazione – dopo un periodo di transizione massimo di 5 anni per risanare l’economia e la società – di un plebiscito per l’indipendenza, con l’apertura di negoziazioni con lo Stato italiano e l’Unione Europea.
Dichiarazione di Indipendenza della Sicilia e Convocazione di un’Assemblea Costituente.
Il bisogno di aiuto dai Siciliani della Diaspora
I Siciliani nel mondo sentono la loro “patria” più che gli stessi Siciliani nella loro terra.
Una raccolta di fondi soltanto nazionale sarebbe un processo troppo lento: oggi la Sicilia è molto povera e non può attendere un processo di liberazione politica troppo lungo.
Finanziare l’Indipendenza Siciliana non è solo giusto, ma anche conveniente: un’occasione grande e fresca per fare investimenti liberi in una terra libera.
Altri modi in cui puoi aiutarci
Alcuni di voi potranno non contribuire, ma ciò non significa che non vogliono aiutarci: potete usare Indiegogo per condividere i nostri strumenti! Per favore, condividete la nostra campagna quanto più possibile!
I Primi Passi
C’è bisogno di un primo programma: “Make the Sicily Free I”: Vincere le elezioni di Palermo, la capitale della Sicilia.
Raggiungere i nostri potenziali elettori per mezzo di:

produzione di volantini, brochure, cartelloni ed altro materiale a stampa per questa competizione elettorale;
produzione di spot politici ed altri mezzi multimediali da diffondere sulle TV o sui social networks.

Grazie per l’attenzione. E per l’aiuto!

Although many foreigners come to the Himalayans to ski, only few Nepalis are able to ski and snowboard.<br/><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>About us</b></p>We are a grassroot Nepal based NGO that aims to educate Nepalis in skiing and snowboarding. We are about 15 Nepali tourism students and five mountainguides who decided, that after the earthquake of 2015 the time was ripe for something new. Together with ski instructors from Switzerland, Austria and Germany we have conducted the first major ski training in February 2016.<br/><br/><p> 30 local female and male students were trained for 21 days in Rolwaling valley in Dolakaha district for free.The training consisted of basic ski/snowboard courses and avalanche training. At the moment we have 25 sets of skitour equipment and 4 Snowboards. Now its time to  scale it up and set up the first permanent ski school for mountain guides and locals in Nepal.</p><p>We insist that all skiing activities must be conducted in a sustainable way and in close interaction with the local communities!<br/></p><p><b>The Project</b><br/></p><p>The main target is to provide sufficient training, so Nepali instructors can  teach snowsports to Nepali students. Our training plan consists of beginners and advanced courses including avalanche awareness and crevasse rescue techniques. We can thereby profit from the mountaineering experience of local mountainguides and climbing sherpas that do already have incredible skills in operating in glacial and high mountainous terrain.</p><p>This is the first Skischool in Nepal and the highest in the world. After the earthquake in 2015 we decided to set new incentives for future of Nepal. We are highly motivated to encourage and educate more boys and girls about skis.<br/></p><p>We concentrated on the Rolwaling valley, due to the major damage by the earthquake and landslides the year before. The valley offers excellent ski opportunities and skitouring could seriously improve the living conditions of the whole community.<br/></p><p>Your support will go directly in the development of our ski school. So far the expenses of our first training were taken of by our private capital and by the european ski instructors. Now its your time to support us:<br/></p><p>Firstly we will invest the majority of funds into a house in Khare based right on the bottom of Mera Peak (6416m). The house is in a good shape, welll insulated and only 2 years old. The family who sells it wants to migrate to the US. <br/></p><p>The house is located on 4800m in a village called Khare and has 7 small double bedroom, one kitchen, one living room and costs <b>27000$</b>. The owners are selling climbing equipment, worth <b>8000$</b>, too. So this would be a package  deal that all of us would benefit.  On the glacier we could train 24/7 during the whole year while sleeping in our ski school, offering training, guided tours and equipment rental. So this is a perfect opportunity and a fair deal. We will inspect the house and the climbing gear during our mountain guide ski training in September on Mera Peak.</p><p>Second of all we neeed to continue to explore the best spots for 
skitouring and ski mountaineering in Nepal and aquire more ski 
equipment. Therefore we would need another<b> 5000$</b> to scout in Nepals far 
Western region and Dolpo which lacks roads and is only accesible by air.</p><p>Third off all, we need more skis. Collecting them in Europe and US is no problem. However, cargo fees are extremly expensive. We will use another <b>5000$</b> for cargo fees for collected equipment.<br/></p><p>We can offer skimountaineering races, freeride events and snowboard competitions to promote skiing in Nepal and generate income for our running expenses.<br/></p><p> In two years, our mountain guides will be ready to guide foreigners on various peaks in Nepal for skitouring or splitboarding to expand their season and generate revenues for their respective families and other stakeholders.</p><br/><p>If we cannot raise sufficient funds to buy a house for our ski school we will use it for seasonal ski/snowboard training sessions, rent and equipment. However it would be a lot more efficient, if we could train all year in the mountains on the glacier.</p><p>By supporting us you can become part of our NGO, join us on the slope or
 for a first descent of a 5000m or 6000m peak with our mountain guides!</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Our Partners</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p>We are cooperating with the Khumbu Climbing Center (KCC) that was founded 10 years ago and offers courses to young climbing Sherpas in ice and rock climbing.

structures want to start something from scratch to rebuild their country
 in a new, sustainable and comprehensive way.<br/><br/>Our NGO supports guides and local youngsters by giving them new opportunities, creating new jobs and a new season for skiing in their traditional communities. In many valleys, youngsters move to Kathmandu because they do not see any 
opportunities in the mountains. This leads to a major demographic 
problem and deserted villages. In the long run, many communities in the high valleys and in particular remote valleys with only little infrastructure, like Rolwaling or Dolpo region, could profit of a sustainable green ski tourism and convince young people to stay in their communities.<br/><p><br/></p><p>Due to the concentration of tourism on Everest and Annapurna Base Camp, the benefits of tourism are not spread evenly but create local grievances.

This is the first Nepali Ski expedition and we will train several days before we will attempt to summit and descent on skis.

In addition we will train crevasse rescue, avalanche theory and excercises.<br/></p><p>From 18th december until 06th January we will conduct a major beginners Ski training in Langtang valley, which was hit by the earthquake like no other village.

Annually the Bamiyan Ski Club organizes a skitour race with hundreds of Afghan and international participants.<br/>Skitouring became popular in Kyrgyzstan, after a couple of Europeans helped to set up the first ski school and thereby set an incentive. Soon, several tour operators and new ski schools and skitour resorts sprouted from the ground and skiing became quickly popular with vast parts of the population. <br/>(<a href=""http://www.returntokyrgyzstan.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.returntokyrgyzstan.com</a>)<br/>Those examples proof the feasibility, joy and the socio-economic benefits that ski deveplopment projects can achieve.<br/><br/><p><b>Risks and Challenges</b><br/></p> <p>Skiing and Snowboarding in the Himalyans is quite different compared to the Americas or the Alps. The highest mountains in the world are majestic but dangerous at the same time. High altitude sickness (HAPE/HACE) can be a deadly risk if not treated correctly.<br/><br/>However, it is possible to acclimatize accordingly to the respective heigths by ascending slowly and sleeping at lower altitudes. Mitigating the risks of altitude sickness by taking the necessary precautions is possible and part of the job.<br/>Our mountain guides and ski instructors have the required experience and skills to overcome those risks and to ski safley in high altitudes.<br/><br/>The variability of snowfall in the Himalayans and in particular the central Himalayans is another challenge to overcome. Early or late snowfall can fluctuate dramatically and is a challenge for ski projects in the Himalayans.<br/><br/>Despite the fact of varying snow conditions, we found several places with a decent snow cover where seasonal skiing is possible for several months. In addition, our future Ski school in Khare is right on the bottom of Mera glacier. Theroretically we can ski the whole yeare<br/></p><p>Avalanches and crevasses can create a major risk while skiing in the Himalayans. We donated six avalanche beacons to the Air rescue service during the summer. In the winter we always use those systems if we go skiing and offer enhanced avalanche awareness and rescue training to our guides and students.

<h4>Hi everybody</h4>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</div>My name is Birman Shrestha. I spent almost all my childhood in poverty that is why I moved to Kathmandu, my country's capital, after my school in search of better opportunities. When I left home, my mom gave me about $5  (thank you, my lovely mom). She gave me the only money she had at the time. After a few weeks, I spent all the money and I found myself without food or shelter, but thank God I got a job in a garment factory for $5 per month, with no food or insurance included. I was honest and strong, I struggled a lot. Maybe because of that, I trust myself and I have received support for further studies. I ended up graduating from Art College. I came to the job market as an artist. I did so many activities that helped me learn more and make myself stronger. Now I am 31 years old, married with 2 children living in Slovenia. <br/><br/>The current situation in Nepal makes me very sad. A lot of people lost their houses and family members. Among of that, my family and my village were one of that too. In my village there is almost 60 houses and one school. We lost everything in the first earthquake (25-04-15). <br/><br/>That's the reason why this community collect was opened in order to raise funds and help rebuild my village and my school. To give to these children new opportunities so they don't have to go through what I have been through. <br/><br/>I would be really happy and thankful to you if I can collect as much money as possible. I will provide food and basic needs for everyone in the village and also help to rebuild houses and the school.  <br/><br/>And step by step I would drum up my neighbors of my village and develop the culture of helping each other, teaching different activities and inviting guests from different countries to show the culture which I will teach and make a welcome program.

</div></div>","Hi everybody


My name is Birman Shrestha. I spent almost all my childhood in poverty that is why I moved to Kathmandu, my country's capital, after my school in search of better opportunities. When I left home, my mom gave me about $5  (thank you, my lovely mom). She gave me the only money she had at the time. After a few weeks, I spent all the money and I found myself without food or shelter, but thank God I got a job in a garment factory for $5 per month, with no food or insurance included. I was honest and strong, I struggled a lot. Maybe because of that, I trust myself and I have received support for further studies. I ended up graduating from Art College. I came to the job market as an artist. I did so many activities that helped me learn more and make myself stronger. Now I am 31 years old, married with 2 children living in Slovenia. The current situation in Nepal makes me very sad. A lot of people lost their houses and family members. Among of that, my family and my village were one of that too. In my village there is almost 60 houses and one school. We lost everything in the first earthquake (25-04-15). That's the reason why this community collect was opened in order to raise funds and help rebuild my village and my school. To give to these children new opportunities so they don't have to go through what I have been through. I would be really happy and thankful to you if I can collect as much money as possible. I will provide food and basic needs for everyone in the village and also help to rebuild houses and the school.  And step by step I would drum up my neighbors of my village and develop the culture of helping each other, teaching different activities and inviting guests from different countries to show the culture which I will teach and make a welcome program. I will make arrangements and guests will stay in our village with my people in their houses.I also would like to send a nice handmade picture-postcard to who colaborate with $50 or more. Incase I couldn't reach to collect that much money I would like to return back that money to the person who try to support us.As I mentioned before, I had a lot of difficulties and I don't want this for the children of my village.

<p><span>In December 2015, an arts partnership that has enriched the learning of students at the Blackstone Innovation School in Boston will cross-oceans and cultures to inspire children at the Light in Africa orphanage through art.</span></p>
<p>A small group representing the core of the Blackstone arts partnership -- Sara Mraish Demeter, founder and executive director of Art Resource Collaborative for Kids, Blackstone principal Danielle Morrissey, Blackstone art teacher Olivia Chaffee, and Blackstone Multiple-Disabilities Strand Specialist Michelle Blanchard -- will lead a workshop based on ARCK’s curriculum with the goal of making a multi-sensory arts experience accessible for orphaned children with varied abilities.</p>
<p>This partnership will take place at Light in Africa Children’s Home in Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Light in Africa was founded in 2000 when Mama Lynn Elliot felt a calling to help children and communities impacted by HIV/AIDS and other medical conditions in Tanzania. Since then about 35,000 children and adults have been assisted in the Mt. Kilimanjaro area. Mama Lynn runs nine children homes. Each home addresses the needs of infants and children with special needs, complex needs and homelessness, as well as malnutrition and various health ailments. The population of her children is similar to those at the Blackstone. Light in Africa provides children with access to a food kitchen and medical outreach as well as, education, vocational training, and most of all love.</p>
<p>Sara, Danielle, Olivia and Michelle wish to teach a week-long workshop that uses reading, writing, storytelling and painting as a means to foster hope, give children a safe environment to explore self-expression, and help orphaned children rebuild their lives. The workshop, titled, “Storybook through Art” aims to utilize a book of children’s choosing to help them gain understanding through various modes of learning -- primarily reading, writing, visual art, and performance. The team will lead storytelling workshops, then work with children to illustrate their own stories and read the books aloud to the kids. They aspire to close the education gap by using a non-traditional learning environment designed towards giving children the skills to learn as well as the motivation to do so. In addition, this program is going to be accessible to all students of age and ability at the orphanage due to the accommodations and modifications that will be provided under the discretion of Michelle Blanchard.</p>
<p>In turn, this experience will carry over to the Blackstone Innovation School community in many ways. Foremost, the staff at Blackstone will be positively impacted by this experience. Our journey will be documented on a live, interactive blog. Staff will be able to follow our experience and progress as it unfolds. Then, upon arrival back to the United States, Danielle, Olivia, and Michelle will lead a professional development session to report their findings and ultimately share their experience with the Blackstone community, highlighting beneficial components they learned that can be incorporated into our daily instruction since we service a similar population of children.</p>
<p>Secondly, our scholars will be directly impacted by this experience. To help increase global awareness and education of our students at Blackstone, we will provide supplemental lessons and materials to three different areas of our school wide instruction: social studies, art, and grade 3 Engage New York ELA module 1.  In social studies, we will provide a unit of instruction on African culture, consisting of artifacts and photographs to accurately portray the culture. In art, Olivia will implement a unit on African tribal art and will expose students to this unique craft and also allow them to create their own. In ELA, specifically In Module 1 for grade Engage New York curriculum, the focus of study is how books are brought to children all over the world. Our experience and knowledge of bringing literacy to the orphanage in Africa will supplement this unit, and provide a differentiated and unique experience solely for students at Blackstone.</p>
<p>Lastly, to maintain these units of study, and to also maintain our partnership with Light of Africa, we will be identifying the orphanage as a sister school. Through consistent and ongoing communication, and by maintaining the relationships we will have built as a result of the work we complete, we will utilize our sister school as a resource that will continue to increase the global awareness and knowledge that our Blackstone scholars receive. Ways in which we will utilize our sister partnership includes, but is not limited to, creating a pen-pal program to deepen our students’ experience and ground them in the work they are doing, and to also support the educational needs at Light in Africa as they work to strengthen their school and the experiences they can provide their students. </p>
<br/><p>Your donation will help them buy books, and materials for the students as well as provide delivery of the materials to Tanzania, printing, other resources, and fund the training and support of volunteers. Most importantly your donation will allow us to continue the program once a week for four months after we have left. This will allow 40-80 orphanage children to heal and learn creatively through arts and literacy. Art Therapy is one of the most effective ways to reduce stress levels in children. Developmental theories state that most children do not fully develop verbal skills until adolescence. Art is one of the only ways children can accurately express emotions and communicate with the people around them.</p>

<p><b>SUMMARY</b></p>
<p>Volunteer experts from <i>In Harm's Way</i> collaborate with local Indonesian leaders, college students and scientists to educate at least 1000 school children and their families in earthquake and tsunami survival skills.</p>
<p>Check out this interview with founder, Ron Harris, to learn more about the aims of In Harm's Way . <a href=""http://www.byuradio.org/episode/1a8baca5-93fb-426e-8efb-abe1decfea0d?playhead=755&amp;autoplay=true"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.byuradio.org/episode/1a8baca5-93fb-426e-8efb-abe1decfea0d?playhead=755&amp;autoplay=true</a><br/></p>
<p><b>WAVES JAVA</b></p>
<p>To prevent loss of life from tsunamis, <i>In Harm's Way</i> in collaboration with <i>Geoscientists Without Borders </i>seeks to involve 4 US students in a tsunami disaster mitigation initiative in Java, Indonesia. These students will train Indonesian counterparts how to:  <br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span>Assess natural hazards in their communities</span></p></li>
<li><p>Involve local communities in effective educational outreach </p></li>
<li><p>Assist in implementing proven disaster mitigation strategies.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The project, <b><i>Waves Java</i></b>, involves experts in disaster mitigation from universities in the US and Indonesia.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449343793/rhk6dmsyimhgxyidel5e.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>THE CHALLENGE</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Indonesian earthquake and tsunami of 2004 resulted in more than 250,000 deaths.  The majority of the deaths and damage from these events could have been prevented if those in harm's way would have known about the risk and implemented protective measures. For example, the more recent 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan affected more people but resulted in fewer than 1/10 as many deaths.</p>
<p>The challenge of <i>In Harm's Way</i> is to prevent natural disasters like these from happening in areas of known risk, but few resources. For this reason, <i>In Harm's Way </i>was established--to bridge the gap between what science is discovering about natural disaster
prevention and the lack of knowledge of the common people at
risk. <i>In Harm's Way </i>ensures people have the appropriate education and skills to protect themselves and therefore, dramatically decrease loss of life.</p>
<p><b>WHY JAVA?</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>The Java coast is one of the most densely populated places on Earth with an average of 1000 people per square kilometer.  It is also located in one of the most active earthquake zones in the world. Historical records and geologic features document that Java has been struck many times by recurring mega-earthquakes and tsunamis. Another earthquake-generated tsunami will inevitably hit this region.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></b></span></p>

<p><b>HOW WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></b></p>
<p><b>Forecasting Accurately.  </b>Local experts collaborate with<i> In Harm's Way</i> to determine the history of tsunamis in coastal cities, construct computer models of past tsunami events to determine the potential damage from future tsunamis, and create tsunami flooding maps of the most densely populated cities of the coast. </p>
<p><b>Communicate the Risk.  </b><i>In Harm's Way</i> helps
local experts communicate to local leaders and citizens the risk level of their
communities. </p>
<p><b>Educate the Vulnerable.  </b><i>In Harm's Way</i> conducts a tsunami education campaign with local
leadership support in the local school system and community. Families,
teachers, administrators &amp; students alike learn the basics of 1) how
tsunamis and earthquakes occur and 2) how to prepare before, survive during, and
respond afterwards.</p>
<p><b>Empower Solutions.  </b><i>In Harm's Way</i> supports community leaders and
citizens to implement tsunami risk reduction methods by 1) establishing
evacuation routes, 2) conducting regular evacuation drills and 3) creating
tsunami-safe zones.</p>
<p><b>OUTCOME:</b><b>  </b>1000
school children and their families will learn how to survive a major
earthquake, how to recognize the signs of an oncoming tsunami, how to evacuate
safely and how to protect their families.</p>
<p><b></b></p>

<p><b>LONG-TERM IMPACT</b></p>
<p>This project will greatly reduce the disaster potential of communities along the Java coast. Those educated will <i>prevent </i>future loss of life and property to the <i>next </i>major earthquake and/or tsunami. <i>Building resilience through preventative strategies is the key to a more stable, safer future.</i></p>

SUMMARY
Volunteer experts from In Harm's Way collaborate with local Indonesian leaders, college students and scientists to educate at least 1000 school children and their families in earthquake and tsunami survival skills.
Check out this interview with founder, Ron Harris, to learn more about the aims of In Harm's Way . http://www.byuradio.org/episode/1a8baca5-93fb-426e-8efb-abe1decfea0d?playhead=755&autoplay=true
WAVES JAVA
To prevent loss of life from tsunamis, In Harm's Way in collaboration with Geoscientists Without Borders seeks to involve 4 US students in a tsunami disaster mitigation initiative in Java, Indonesia. These students will train Indonesian counterparts how to:  


Assess natural hazards in their communities
Involve local communities in effective educational outreach 
Assist in implementing proven disaster mitigation strategies.

The project, Waves Java, involves experts in disaster mitigation from universities in the US and Indonesia.


THE CHALLENGE

The Indonesian earthquake and tsunami of 2004 resulted in more than 250,000 deaths.  The majority of the deaths and damage from these events could have been prevented if those in harm's way would have known about the risk and implemented protective measures. For example, the more recent 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan affected more people but resulted in fewer than 1/10 as many deaths.
The challenge of In Harm's Way is to prevent natural disasters like these from happening in areas of known risk, but few resources. For this reason, In Harm's Way was established--to bridge the gap between what science is discovering about natural disaster
prevention and the lack of knowledge of the common people at
risk. In Harm's Way ensures people have the appropriate education and skills to protect themselves and therefore, dramatically decrease loss of life.
WHY JAVA?

The Java coast is one of the most densely populated places on Earth with an average of 1000 people per square kilometer.  It is also located in one of the most active earthquake zones in the world. Historical records and geologic features document that Java has been struck many times by recurring mega-earthquakes and tsunamis. Another earthquake-generated tsunami will inevitably hit this region.


HOW WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM


Forecasting Accurately.  Local experts collaborate with In Harm's Way to determine the history of tsunamis in coastal cities, construct computer models of past tsunami events to determine the potential damage from future tsunamis, and create tsunami flooding maps of the most densely populated cities of the coast. 
Communicate the Risk.  In Harm's Way helps
local experts communicate to local leaders and citizens the risk level of their
communities. 
Educate the Vulnerable.  In Harm's Way conducts a tsunami education campaign with local
leadership support in the local school system and community. Families,
teachers, administrators & students alike learn the basics of 1) how
tsunamis and earthquakes occur and 2) how to prepare before, survive during, and
respond afterwards.
Empower Solutions.  In Harm's Way supports community leaders and
citizens to implement tsunami risk reduction methods by 1) establishing
evacuation routes, 2) conducting regular evacuation drills and 3) creating
tsunami-safe zones.
OUTCOME:  1000
school children and their families will learn how to survive a major
earthquake, how to recognize the signs of an oncoming tsunami, how to evacuate
safely and how to protect their families.


LONG-TERM IMPACT
This project will greatly reduce the disaster potential of communities along the Java coast. Those educated will prevent future loss of life and property to the next major earthquake and/or tsunami. Building resilience through preventative strategies is the key to a more stable, safer future.
Why invest in WAVES JAVA?
You will:

        Reduce the disaster potential of 6 Java regions
        Prevent loss of life of 1000s of Indonesians
        Build resilience & self-reliance of at least 1000 families
        Foster empowerment of at least 1000 school children
        Diminish economic losses
       Minimize the need for relief efforts and funds  






MEET THE TEAM: 


Several international scientists, with decades of experience
in natural disaster mitigation, volunteer their
time and expertise to combine best practices. Our combined efforts have already
saved thousands of lives.

•Dr. Ron Harris, PhD, has conducted geological research in Indonesia for 27 years and published 35 papers on geological issues there. Harris speaks Indonesian and is primarily responsible for leading the expeditions.  http://geology.byu.edu/home/content/Faculty%20Directory/ron-harris
•Daniel Horns, PhD, (Associate Dean, Utah Valley University) specializes in paleo-seismology and trenching techniques. He is primarily responsible for training students in tsunami deposit excavations.  http://www.uvu.edu/profpages/profiles/show/vid/1000 9356

•Carolus Prasetyadi, PhD, is a Professor at Universitas Pembangunan Nasional (UPN) in central Java. He co-founded the Center for Natural Disaster Mitigation at UPN. His primary role is to coordinate and supervise the mentoring activities of the Indonesian students from UPN working with each of the professionals on the project.
•Rachel Dunn (BSc. Geology) will be primarily responsible for collaborating with Indonesian students to integrate data into inundation maps and train them to use Ground Penetrating RADAR (GPR) for exploring the extent of tsunami deposits in the subsurface. She will also lead the community outreach collaboration.
•Nova Roosmawati (MSc. geology) is an Indonesian geologist who has worked with Drs. Harris and Prasetyadi in disaster mitigation research since 1997. Nova’s primary role is to direct project logistics and coordinate student mentoring.

<p><b>Our Story</b></p>
<p>As someone that has been
brought up on Hip Hop music, I know how much impact it has on our lives. A lot
of you Hip Hop Heads might not realise it anymore, but so many things you do -
the way you talk, how you act, your swag have been influenced by Hip Hop music.</p>
<p>I live in London and travel
to New York City fairly often. Off the bat there is a big difference in
culture. I mean a couple of years ago, the day after I arrived J. Cole played a
surprise performance in New York. I got there within' 10 minutes of his tweet
announcing the location and was already 300 people back in the queue. I
remember thinking to myself: ""This would never happen for Hip Hop in
London"". But then a year later, J. Cole bought the Dollar and a Dream tour
over here and did the same thing. It was amazing! Of late artists such as Kanye
West and Drake have been embracing UK Hip Hop (we call it Grime). Just a few
weeks ago a huge UK Grime artists, Skepta had a surprise concert in a car park!
(Something he said he would do one day, about two years ago.)</p>
<p>This is something I've been
waiting to happen for ages; US and UK Hip Hop culture to come together. We've
already heard a couple songs with Krept &amp; Konan with Rick Ross and Jeremih
- no one can tell me those weren't straight fire. And I know you're all waiting
for that Kanye X Skepta to come out.</p>
<p>I just want to be able to
take this opportunity where Hip Hop is at a new golden age with these new
legends and make something for the people, by the people.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
</div><div><b>New Legendz</b></div><p>First of all we have an
Instagram and Snapchat. You can add us, the username for both is new.legendz</p>
<p>Hip Hop is an ever evolving
culture. I've always liked the phrase ""What is a celebrity without their
fans?"" But here at New Legendz we don't see it as rappers and listeners.
Or athletes and fans. We see it as one big community. After all, it is you that
has some Dre Beats or those fresh new Yeezy's. </p>
<p><b>Instagram</b><br/>
So we use Instagram as a means of getting information to people. There are a
million sites and twitter accounts that you can follow that will give you a
download link to a song or leaked album. That's not what we're here from. We
don't want your hits. We want your opinions. You wont be suckered into
someone's website with us, with a hundred pop ups as soon as you hit download.
We post relevant information. You'll get to see the best bits of a concert, not
some rubbish view where you can't even hear the performer. You'll get the
pictures that are making waves through the net, not every repost we could possibly
spam you with from every artist out. We condense the information and get it out
to you. We will also have a Twitter account soon, but that is only to redirect
you to other places where you can hear new music or see new videos that we
can't show you in a 15 second Instagram clip. We really want this experience to
be tailored to your day, not a hindrance to it.</p>
<p><b>Snapchat</b><br/>
We created a Snapchat account so that you get your information as soon as
possible. Let me assure you know, we won't be having 300 second stories (unless
there is a dope concert going on and we want you to be part of that live). If a
song drops, it will come straight to your phone. If Drake or Beyonce decide to
release a brand new album out of nowhere, you will be the first to know. Any Hip
Hop related events like the Yeezy raffles or surprise car park shows will be
straight to your phone. </p>
<p><b>New Legendz Website</b><br/><i>
OUR LEGENDZ</i> - Like I said before, there are a million Hip Hop blogs out there
keeping you in the know. Well that's what our Instagram and Snapchat are for.
Our website will be almost run by you guys. Exclusively think pieces. We want
to get the opinions of you guys out to the world. We want to know why J. Cole
got you out of bed. We want to know why you switched from Spotify to Tidal. We
want to know why you just spent £100 to see Beyonce for 90 minutes of your
life. Of course the website will be regularly updated by us, giving you our
insights into the game, but we think it's important that this site is for the
people. We want to build a community</p>
<p><i>NEW LEGENDZ </i>- We will also be
bringing new artists to the scene. There is so much talent out there who can’t
get off the ground because they need backing from a major label. Although we
are not a label, we will be able to give them the platform and recognition they
need to succeed. After all, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis made a multi-platinum
album without any help. We are currently working with some small artists who
have EP’s coming out soon on itunes.</p><p>We hope to have the website up by July.</p><p><b>New Legendz - Club Nights</b><br/>We have found that although the UK has some pretty good hip hop nights in terms of music and DJs, there has never been much atmosphere and hype around them. We want to start a club night which follows through. The next day you can go online and re live the night. We'll have exclusive merch that you can only get at that specific night. We want to bring in performers so you're not just stuck with a DJ all night long. Not only will we get known artists but we want to bring in local up and coming artists showcasing their talent. Hopefully we can have our first night up and running for freshers weeks - when students start university.</p>
<p><b>So why do we need the money?</b><br/>
We wish we could provide you with all this for free. But it's just too damn
hard. The upkeep of such a constant stream of information is tiring. It takes a
lot out of our day. Personally, I'm a student and will be at the forefront.
I've got to balance all this with schoolwork in hopes of getting a degree.
Please don't let this discourage you from our movement, I assure you, I and the
whole team are 100% behind New Legendz. It is something we all hold dear to our
hearts.</p>
<p><b>What will we spend the money on?</b><br/>
I'm not going to try and sell you the idea, I'm sure you know exactly what we
are offering you. So here is a few things that your money will be going
towards.<br/>
-Starting and up-keeping a website with constant traffic.<br/>
-Event tickets such as concerts and special shows.<br/>
-Producing merchandise that is influenced by the culture. Not some huge
clothing brand, but just something that is unique. Something that you can wear
every now and then where people will definitely ask where you get them from.<br/>
-Equipment needed to document and convey all these events that happen<br/></p> <div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Risks and challenges</b><br/>I only see one challenge that comes with this task and that is balancing this project with school. So I'm not in high school, I've just finished high school. I'm 18 years old and will be going to University for the next three years of my life. So it's not like I am constantly working 24/7 on school work. Honestly, I will probably be putting more hours into this project. It's much easier to pursue something you're passionate about. It's not a chore to run this project. It will be something I always want to be working on no matter what.</span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div>We know that not everyone is able to contribute; no matter how much they support something. If you can't contribute now we totally understand and know you will support us in another way while we build this collective.

<h3><b>What's with the horses?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The horse is a great vehicle (forgive
the pun!) for teaching people about behaviour, interaction, and communication.   Horse and Human partnerships represents one of the oldest applications of technological connection! Horses provide endless examples for me to work with clients across the spectrum
from small and medium sized businesses, to high-performance international sport
coaches and key decision-makers in larger corporate organisations. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In this short video clip, my client (a senior manager by profession) came to me looking for <b>help with the way he interacts and engages with people</b>. There was a lot of discussion between us prior to this early session and he gave me permission to show you this. You'll see him create a situation where the horse (purposely selected for this lesson) let's him know very clearly he's not happy with how the interaction is being  conducted.  Benny's a horse who doesn't respond well to anything he considers to be unreasonable!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DF5LR_yb-K64&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FF5LR_yb-K64%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>You can see from the iPhone video, that Benny reacts to <b>messaging that's unclear, and therefore unreasonable.</b> My client continues to try and use force (via the rope and conveying a sense of the 'threat' of discipline). Benny isn’t too impressed by that and <b>gives a number of building signals that something needs to change</b>.  When that doesn't happen, well he does the only thing he thinks he can to make his point!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This is one of the things I really love, and that my clients come to understand - <b>A horse doesn't care what reputation might have been built up
around you, or how good a leader you might think you are.</b>  <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The horse doesn’t care <i>who</i> you are, but best of all, a horse responds through the way you treat it – you have to earn credibility!  I'm proud to say that this client made incredible progress; it has even impacted on his relationship with his two sons. He describes himself as being <b>almost unrecognisable</b> now from his previous self as the result of the responsibility he took to seek help from me with making some behavioural changes and increasing his self-awareness - that's one of the reasons he was generous, and brave, in letting me show you an example of this work in practice. I'm very grateful to him for doing so and both he and I hope this helps provide you some context.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Nothing helps you learn a healthy dose of humility and patience like a horse. I use horses to help me because <b>you have to earn the positive response</b></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">...and <i>it's not actually about the horse!</i></span></p>

I'm
seeking contributions that will primarily be used to develop infrastructure and apply smart technology, which helps me deliver my #equinefacilitatedlearning workshops and programmes more widely, efficiently and
effectively.

My story...

G'Day, I'm Jason - The Naked Horseman


I've spent most of my professional life helping
to grow leaders and people, so I 
love this venture – especially sharing
the buzz with clients from the moments where struggle suddenly makes sense. Through interactive equine-facilitated workshops and
programmes, I teach leadership to illustrate key messages
about communication, behaviour and interaction.




As a leader, I believe your fundamental obligation is to your people - before anything else; without that being right, everything is harder. When the circumstances are challenging and things aren’t going the way you planned, as a leader I've not only learned how to think my way through problems, but also that it's the quality of the bonds with the team of people around you that will help you to lead well and get out of the tricky situation. I'm grateful to all those along the way who taught me and this is my way of paying it forward.

Being around horses and working with
them has always reached something visceral in me. I've grown to appreciate
how fantastic horses are at helping both me and other people learn how to enhance the ways in which
we interact, especially when I overlay and apply modern technology to enhance teaching and feedback.  




What's with the horses?

The horse is a great vehicle (forgive
the pun!) for teaching people about behaviour, interaction, and communication.   Horse and Human partnerships represents one of the oldest applications of technological connection! Horses provide endless examples for me to work with clients across the spectrum
from small and medium sized businesses, to high-performance international sport
coaches and key decision-makers in larger corporate organisations. 

In this short video clip, my client (a senior manager by profession) came to me looking for help with the way he interacts and engages with people. There was a lot of discussion between us prior to this early session and he gave me permission to show you this. You'll see him create a situation where the horse (purposely selected for this lesson) let's him know very clearly he's not happy with how the interaction is being  conducted.  Benny's a horse who doesn't respond well to anything he considers to be unreasonable!



You can see from the iPhone video, that Benny reacts to messaging that's unclear, and therefore unreasonable. My client continues to try and use force (via the rope and conveying a sense of the 'threat' of discipline). Benny isn’t too impressed by that and gives a number of building signals that something needs to change.  When that doesn't happen, well he does the only thing he thinks he can to make his point!

This is one of the things I really love, and that my clients come to understand - A horse doesn't care what reputation might have been built up
around you, or how good a leader you might think you are.  The horse doesn’t care who you are, but best of all, a horse responds through the way you treat it – you have to earn credibility!  I'm proud to say that this client made incredible progress; it has even impacted on his relationship with his two sons. He describes himself as being almost unrecognisable now from his previous self as the result of the responsibility he took to seek help from me with making some behavioural changes and increasing his self-awareness - that's one of the reasons he was generous, and brave, in letting me show you an example of this work in practice. I'm very grateful to him for doing so and both he and I hope this helps provide you some context.


Nothing helps you learn a healthy dose of humility and patience like a horse. I use horses to help me because you have to earn the positive response...and it's not actually about the horse!






So why would you want to contribute?

You have the opportunity here to not only contribute to, but also to personally benefit from the development of a unique set of practical services.  Not only would you be part of having a positive impact on the people you interact with or lead, but you can help set the conditions where I can broaden access to my services - both within New Zealand, and internationally.      

When you think back to the short video, have you ever been treated badly by someone who was supposed to be a leader? Have you ever looked at someone struggling as a leader, and wished you could help? Do you know a remarkable young person who needs guidance and a chance to grow? Are you a leader wrestling with what that actually means? Perhaps you and others consider that you’re a fantastic leader - but you want to be even better?





Your contribution will help me to vastly accelerate the development and scope of a business that has already had significant positive impact on many different types of people - a parent suddenly realises there is a better way to interact with their child; it dawns on a CEO that there’s a better way to lead and work with fellow board members, or a sports coach realises the athlete is not a machine, but a human.  I've helped people deal more effectively with bullying bosses, and I've shown bullying bosses how to learn not to be. I've helped people lacking confidence find belief and empower themselves; I've coached managers to discover that there’s a better way to work with a team than they've been doing.  I've even helped small business owners find their way back to why they started with renewed passion. 



My business is all about helping the growth of your credibility as an individual and as a leader by focusing attention on your expertise, and your relationships. I’m committed to helping people tangibly improve through personal and professional development that's authentic.
If you value and yearn for personal and professional development that's immediately relevant, has enduring results and adds uncommon, genuine value; if you value an original approach that’s interactive, pragmatic, and works across cultures; if you value a proven approach that works across the spectrum from individuals to corporate groups, then you're invited to contribute.


You'll enable provision of leadership and personal development originating in New Zealand, and impacting Internationally!




I'm seeking contributions that will primarily be used
to develop infrastructure that helps me deliver my workshops and programmes more widely,  efficiently and effectively.  Development of infrastructure is now crucial to growth and to meeting client expectations in a safe, functional and appropriate environment.  However, this lays the foundation for me to finally take up invitations to run workshops and programmes overseas. 

The incredible part for me is that my workshops scale and impact across both international and cultural boundaries. I've not only worked with New Zealanders (of various ethnic origin), but also people from Britain, Sweden, Ireland, Holland, The USA, South Korea, Australia, India and Germany.  

I can tell you it's been hard work, but I've already come a long way from operating in an empty paddock back in November 2011: The Property Progress Gallery





...roll forward to March 2015 - it's getting there!




What I need: 

I've an underpinning philosophy of not being greedy and of taking a lean approach to things. However, I’ve
reached a point where the volume of business coming in means a typically understated New Zealand approach of ‘making do’
doesn’t cut it any more - I need to develop infrastructure
beyond the basics I’ve established so far, and be smart with niche technology to add efficiency, but I need some help.





Contributions will be spent on:

A barn with a proper classroom
for facilitation of discussion, rather than using my dining room! It might be similar in style to what's pictured below, but I understand funds raised will dictate the reality of the situation, and I'll manage accordingly. The barn will be centred on where the horse-float and shipping container are in this picture:






Horse-stalls (not dis-similar from these pictured) in which I can place horses to be groomed, rested or fed, AND SAFE between workshop sessions:


Development of my workshop and programme content to ensure strategic differentiation, and eventual overseas conduct of workshops and programmes (from 2017). I'm currently developing two new workshops: one on governance that will provide practical tools for directors, and another on cultural awareness. I also need to continue investment in brand development and marketing. 

A purpose built, well-drained, out-door
arena enabling me to run my courses and workshops even when
the ground gets wet! The picture's just an example of what it might look like when finished. Getting wet isn't the issue (it's part of the experience), but being in an un-flat, soggy paddock currently is!  This article, which I discovered in 2012, has been a useful reference for understanding the requirements and helping me plan realistically. 



Purchase of a Lily-Camera drone - overlaying technology to provide all-round state-of-the-art feedback! 

Using a tracking device for events or learning points I want to capture or to follow, after throwing the Lily high into the air, both the client and I then go about our activity. Lily flies around and shoots pictures or video all by itself.  The footage is not only played back in the classroom during our facilitated, specialist discussion  - but my client's will get to keep a DVD of themselves either as a memento, or as a key aid between sessions with me over the course of multiple workshops or a programme.
Incidentally, you can learn more about Lily here - it's a genius piece of kit, that's great value for money, from an exciting young company. What they've produced will add a fun, new dimension to things for me and especially my clients - with better results than I can achieve currently from a hand-held iPhone!

[In case you're worried, my horses will quickly learn to get used to the presence of the drones. Our neighbour is a commercial helicopter company - Amalgamated Helicopters. Whilst they are extremely considerate with their flight paths, the noise they can't help but create in fact helps me make nice, steady horses.  The Lily drone won't represent any sort of challenge for them!]   


The bottom line - what you get (in return for your contribution):


I'm offering contributors a number of perks, graduated relative to the contribution:



Some of these perks offer you the opportunity to experience my distinct services for yourself – I
promise you’ll find the sample workshops representative, challenging and
rewarding! I’ll work in partnership with you to develop unique training that
helps you invest in the people and leaders in your life, or organisation.

Some of these perks offer you the opportunity to advertise your company or product with me for up to a 12 month period, or beyond by negotiation.
All of the perks involve assignment of a
portion of your contribution to the scholarship programme I referred to earlier.
All contributions will be acknowledged on our social media and web-page. If there is a contribution level and perk outside those I've listed, please get in touch and we can discuss the detail. 

You have the
opportunity to be part of the development of this proudly Wairarapa-born, but ambitiously international venture with me. Good
things need investment just like young Montana here:  






Other Ways You Can Help
I appreciate that some people
just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help, if you would like
to.  Please:  


Spread the word and help make me make some noise about this campaign.
Use the Indiegogo share tools.
Send a link to this campaign on your Linked In, Facebook or Twitter
sites.
Offer me input/advice because of an area of expertise you have.

And that's all there is to it...

Finally - what's in it for me?





At a personal level, being able to earn
a living through a life with a sense of purpose has always been important; it’s
enabled me to develop leading people in a way that draws on the opportunities
I've been privileged to experience.  It
involves giving something back as you go along – hence my real burning ambition to
establish a scholarship programme, designed to lay good foundations in
remarkable young people who will become the leaders of our future!

From a business perspective, I want to make a difference, and developing this adventure enables me to offer services, which do that in a distinctive, and authentic way.




If you want to know more about me running a workshop for you or your organisation, please visit my webpage and read about the services I can offer. 
You can also email me (nakedhorseman@tgle.co.nz), or tweet (@HorsemanThe) or connect with me on LinkedIn (Search First Name: The Naked Horseman). 


Thank you.

of seeing other children on stage juggling, doing acrobatics, doing things they
never imagined they could do, gives children in a war torn country, like
Afghanistan, hope, enjoyment and the prospect of achievement. Afghan Mobile Mini Circus for Children (MMCC) (www.AfghanMMCC.org) by its educational and entertaining activities has brought joy and laughter to over 3 million children in 28 provinces of Afghanistan since 2002.

The Impact

Entertainment is good everywhere but in Afghanistan Circus
activities are much more than just entertainment: it is a collective therapy
and a window from the war to a beautiful dream world that makes people rethink
and review their lives, values, and attitudes with and for children.




170 young artists get
     plenty of trainings to improve their skills to perform in their regional teams in different parts of Afghanistan for an entire year.


Tens of thousands of Afghan
     children enjoy entertaining and educational performances with music, theater, comedies and other physical arts such as juggling, acrobatics, unicycle.


Estimated 340 girls and boys from
     5 regions of Afghanistan participate in local, regional,  and finally National Juggling
     Championship.


As seen last year, the activities get lots of positive national and international media coverage. Good news, photos and reports over children’s activities brings a bit of fresh air and hope into the warzone.




Risks & Challenges 
Security, conservatism, political instability and much more are among the risks and challenges we face with nearly all that we do and every day. However none of these are new to us, since we have been running our activities in Afghanistan for over 13 years. Relying on our long experience and local networks and support, as well as the insight to the culture and respect to all local values we will continue making children’s circus in Afghanistan a historical success.

You will probably be aware that on the 13th March this year Vanuatu was ravaged by Cyclone Pam, the worst storm to hit the region in many years. Helen said that the half hour of winds of between 140 - 200 mph that battered her home in Port Vila that day was the scariest thing she's ever been through. <br/><br/>Fortunately, Cyclone Pam did not leave a large loss of life in its terrifying wake, but what it did leave was huge damage particularly to ten more remte areas. John's brother-in-law, Edward's home island of Erromango was particularly badly devastated. Huge damage was caused to the Happy Land Primary School where Edward's sister teaches. In particular the building itself, but also the water supply and the gardens, where much of the food for the school children is produced, were seriously damaged. John Corrigan Frances Law and some friends are organising a coffee morning on Saturday May 9th in Kilry Hall between 10 and noon.Short Summary</h3>
<div>We have created this funding page for people who are unable to come to Kilry Hall for the fundraising coffee morning. Every pound we raise will help to re establish the school and its garden. There is a huge effort going on across Vanu Atu to clear the devastation but this campaign is special because it directly connects people on Erromango with us here in the UK who all know and care about the Corrigans and their family. This is a fast and direct way to make a difference now.</div>
<div>To describe a little about the situation on Erromango - when Helen, Edward and their daughters visit their family there they take a boat and then have an 8 hour trek through jungle to the village. Now, since the cyclone and the damage to the jungle all the trees are down, which means that the trek which was possible previously with a machete, now requires a chainsaw. The islands main business was the export of sandalwood it will take years to reestablish the business. In the meantime we can help by supporting the school and giving the children and their families a positive input. In the scale of things it is a small help but could be vital to building moral for the community as it recovers.</div>
</div><div>Donations of £5 £10 and more will be very gratefully recieved. A donation of £20 or more will be thanked with an email updating you of the work on Erromango. </div><div>

<h3>Exoskeletons and robots
</h3> <p></p>For decades, science fiction fans have dreamed of donning their own exoskeleton and using it to perform superhuman tasks. What if you could lift several hundred pounds? Think of how fast you could move from one apartment to the other if you could lift any object in your house! You could even lift a box of books!<br/><br/>My name is Victor. I'm an engineer and a project manager. I'm also a huge science<br/>fiction fan. Remember the power-loader from Aliens? We had the concept for that in<br/>the mid-1980s! A lot of people said the communicators from Star Trek and the little pad devices they used would be impossible. Well, we've got them now! In fact, they were both invented by the same company!<br/><br/>An exoskeleton would allow any man or woman to exert several tons of torque, pressure or lifting power while performing precision actions. How would this change rescue operations? How might this change construction? What capabilities would this provide people who, because of their physical limitations can't participate in certain occupations or tasks?<br/><br/>Many construction, repair, excavation, transport and even search and rescue tasks depend entirely on finding the right tool for the job. Over humanity's history, when the right tool could not be found, often its invention became necessary. Now, we propose to invent the right tool for every job. Equipped with an exoskeleton, any human being will have the ability to go anywhere and do just about anything a human body is capable of with several orders of magnitude more power and durability than otherwise. <br/><br/>It is not hard to see how this would change the world. A single person would instantly become capable of building a house, or even a small office building. Dangerous ordeals like a child trapped at the bottom of a well would no longer put dozens of lives at risk. No underground worker or car accident victim would ever be trapped again. No victim of an earthquake would ever be at risk of never being found. <br/><br/>Handicapped people would not only have their mobility restored, but improved beyond what it originally was. <br/><br/>The ability to exert maximum power at the exact location where it can do the most good is what an exoskeleton can do for humanity. It will change the world in ways that nobody has ever even dreamed before.<br/><br/>I don't want to reinvent the wheel. I know there are exoskeletons out there. But I want to build <b>affordable</b> exoskeleton robots which can be customized.<br/><br/>For this reason, we would appreciate your support so we can make this compelling vision a reality. Be one of our pre-release customers!<br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
</div><h3><br/></h3><h3>Stretch goals<br/>
</h3>
<p><br/></p><p>To patent our exoskeleton robot we need $500. To donate one Scout exoskeleton we need to achieve our stretch goal of $20,000. This includes materials and manufacturing. We will increasingly donate
exoskeleton robots, technical support, physical therapy and
psychological therapy while we achieve our stretch goals. <br/></p><p>If we hit our stretch goal of $100,000 we'll donate two Scout exoskeletons, give our exoskeleton customers free technical support and software upgrades for 1 year. With $300,000 we'll donate 3 Scout exoskeletons, give our exoskeleton customers free psychological and physical therapy for 1 year.<br/></p><p><br/></p><h3><b>What you get</b></h3><p><br/></p><p>Building a general purpose external powered skeleton robot (exoskeleton robot) for use by human beings is not a project only limited to certain kinds of applications. We consider our devices to be “general purpose” machines, which can be used by the handicapped, workers in physically demanding jobs, or anyone with a need for more power.</p><p><br/>There are a variety of control mechanisms built in to our exoskeleton models. A user can control their unit by voice commands or remote control, and each unit is capable of communicating with other devices and control mechanisms through the GPS system, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Exoskeletons will be equipped with digital cameras.</p><p><br/>Our company will provide training, technical support and certification for licensed professionals to work with those who are learning how to utilize the exoskeleton as well. Physical therapists, psychotherapists and medical professionals will be able to obtain the latest research on how exoskeletons can be used to advance the physical capabilities of their patients in a wide variety of applications.</p><p><br/>We consider this last point to be of particular importance. This technology is far too valuable to be limited to only a subset of its possible uses. Professional certification will ensure the widest adoption.</p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431572422/hlpzbumvel0eeueh6dct.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>

What peeople say

Exoskeletons and robots
 For decades, science fiction fans have dreamed of donning their own exoskeleton and using it to perform superhuman tasks. What if you could lift several hundred pounds? Think of how fast you could move from one apartment to the other if you could lift any object in your house! You could even lift a box of books!My name is Victor. I'm an engineer and a project manager. I'm also a huge sciencefiction fan. Remember the power-loader from Aliens? We had the concept for that inthe mid-1980s! A lot of people said the communicators from Star Trek and the little pad devices they used would be impossible. Well, we've got them now! In fact, they were both invented by the same company!An exoskeleton would allow any man or woman to exert several tons of torque, pressure or lifting power while performing precision actions. How would this change rescue operations? How might this change construction? What capabilities would this provide people who, because of their physical limitations can't participate in certain occupations or tasks?Many construction, repair, excavation, transport and even search and rescue tasks depend entirely on finding the right tool for the job. Over humanity's history, when the right tool could not be found, often its invention became necessary. Now, we propose to invent the right tool for every job. Equipped with an exoskeleton, any human being will have the ability to go anywhere and do just about anything a human body is capable of with several orders of magnitude more power and durability than otherwise. It is not hard to see how this would change the world. A single person would instantly become capable of building a house, or even a small office building. Dangerous ordeals like a child trapped at the bottom of a well would no longer put dozens of lives at risk. No underground worker or car accident victim would ever be trapped again. No victim of an earthquake would ever be at risk of never being found. Handicapped people would not only have their mobility restored, but improved beyond what it originally was. The ability to exert maximum power at the exact location where it can do the most good is what an exoskeleton can do for humanity. It will change the world in ways that nobody has ever even dreamed before.I don't want to reinvent the wheel. I know there are exoskeletons out there. But I want to build affordable exoskeleton robots which can be customized.For this reason, we would appreciate your support so we can make this compelling vision a reality. Be one of our pre-release customers!   
Stretch goals

To patent our exoskeleton robot we need $500. To donate one Scout exoskeleton we need to achieve our stretch goal of $20,000. This includes materials and manufacturing. We will increasingly donate
exoskeleton robots, technical support, physical therapy and
psychological therapy while we achieve our stretch goals. If we hit our stretch goal of $100,000 we'll donate two Scout exoskeletons, give our exoskeleton customers free technical support and software upgrades for 1 year. With $300,000 we'll donate 3 Scout exoskeletons, give our exoskeleton customers free psychological and physical therapy for 1 year.What you getBuilding a general purpose external powered skeleton robot (exoskeleton robot) for use by human beings is not a project only limited to certain kinds of applications. We consider our devices to be “general purpose” machines, which can be used by the handicapped, workers in physically demanding jobs, or anyone with a need for more power.There are a variety of control mechanisms built in to our exoskeleton models. A user can control their unit by voice commands or remote control, and each unit is capable of communicating with other devices and control mechanisms through the GPS system, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Exoskeletons will be equipped with digital cameras.Our company will provide training, technical support and certification for licensed professionals to work with those who are learning how to utilize the exoskeleton as well. Physical therapists, psychotherapists and medical professionals will be able to obtain the latest research on how exoskeletons can be used to advance the physical capabilities of their patients in a wide variety of applications.We consider this last point to be of particular importance. This technology is far too valuable to be limited to only a subset of its possible uses. Professional certification will ensure the widest adoption.
We'll also have phone appsand a Google Glass application All our exoskeleton robots can be remote controlled through our iPhone, Android and Google Glass applications. This lets you make your 
exoskeleton fetch things, go out to take a picture or record videos or 
stream videos to your phone or tablet. If you can't use your hands to

<p>Hello! I am a Science teacher working at <a href=""http://www.bacademy.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Boston Day and Evening Academy</a>, a Horace Mann Charter School within the Boston Public School system.  I studied Biology and Chemistry in college and discovered Physics in the years after I graduated.  Since then, Physics has been my passion.  After college, I worked as a chef for many years.  Eight years ago I changed profession and became a Science teacher at a school that uses competency based teaching and assessment to re-engage high need, off-track students in their education.  I have worked diligently over the years to create engaging and rigorous curriculum, and I am always looking for ways to up my game in the service of my students. </p>
<br/><p>With every year that passes, the cost of running a school district increases with inflation at the same time that funding either decreases or hovers at the same level. The result is that every year, schools are cutting expenses to keep their budgets balanced.  These budgetary changes inevitably require cutting vital supports, including personnel, programs, and classroom resources.  We are at this point.</p>
<br/><p>I created this campaign to generate funds for my classroom so that my students can have access to both a remarkable new online text book, ergopedia, and to WebAssign, an online instructional system that offers content and supports instant assessment—a crucial component of effective competency-based practice. These two resources will greatly enhance my students’ in- and out-of-class experiences and give me more time to provide instruction and support at their various levels of need.</p>
<br/><p>Your donation will help to provide my students with a brilliant, thorough and engaging e-text book that animates physics principles through interactive text. I am especially enthusiastic about this textbook because it will help students address their misconceptions about Physics principles and get them excited about content through its interactive platform.  I have consulted with colleagues who are already using this e-text in their classrooms at other schools and they all endorse it without exception.</p>

<p>But there’s more!  Your donation will also give students access to the amazing WebAssign; an online “problem set” website that lets teachers build interactive homework assignments that allow students to work together on difficult problems.  One unique aspect of WebAssign is that each student is given the same problem set but with different numbers.  This facilitates students working together, but also requires that they work through their own individual problems.  Even better, WebAssign provides instant feedback on each problem, and allows students to revisit their work when they get incorrect answers.  This is such a great way to work through different problems because it affords every student the opportunity to troubleshoot the method they used to solve those problems. Thus, learning is focused on both the resolution and the process.</p>

These talks focus on Rape Awareness and Combatting Rape Culture performed by Liam Wilding. Also we are supporting UK rape and mental health charities including Rape Crisis England &amp; Wales, Survivors UK and SANE.</span>

It has taken him along time to get to where he is mentally and now he is ready to make a difference. He is using his experience as a rape victim and the issues in our society he suffered through to help make a difference by highlighting these issues and helping rape victims seek support through our tour and media surrounding the tour.</span></div><div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></div><div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Once the tour is complete we intend to launch a petition to start an education program for GCSE students on sexual responsibility focusing on consent, impacts of rape on victims and those around the victims, where victims can get support and how to support victims of sexual assault. We hope the reach of the tour will make the petition a success.</span></div><div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></div><div>
<p>As you can imagine a tour of this magnitude is very expensive to run. The funds raised will be used to go towards providing necessary equipment, travel costs, accommodation costs as well as living costs as Liam Wilding will be working full-time during the tour. It will also provide us with the ability to reach as many people as possible through media surrounding the tour. After careful and detailed financial planning we have projected the cost of running the tour and making it a success will be around £90,000. </p>
<p>We are offering a variety of perks including newsletters, personal emails, personal phone calls and being put on a list of substantial contributors on our website crazylife.co.uk under our crowd funding page. </p>
<p>Due to the expected reach of the tour and the surrounding media being at 5,000,000 people, we see this as a great advertising opportunity for business so we have decided to offer 4 sponsorship opportunities for donations of £30,000 or above so if you are a looking for advertisement for your business we strongly urge you to take this opportunity.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal we will use the funds to start the tour and continue to search for sponsorship for the rest of the tour, during the period of the tour funded by your donations.</p>
<p>As you can imagine doing a tour based around such a difficult and personal subject will be very difficult for Liam but he has battle and overcome so many difficulties as a result of the rape including alcoholism bulimia, PTSD, depression and a personality disorder so we have full confidence in his ability to conduct this tour. Also he has the support of his business partner and closest friend Alberto by his side who has always been a huge support for Liam and will be by his side throughout the tour.</p>
<p>We hope you donate to this opportunity as it has the potential to make a huge impact on so many people and if successful could help combat rape and rape culture which is a huge problem in our society.</p>
<p>Even if you cannot donate we would be very grateful if you could talk about our campaign to your friends swell as sharing our campaign on social media as it is a great opportunity to make a difference in this world.</p>

Also he has the support of his business partner and closest friend Alberto by his side who has always been a huge support for Liam and will be by his side throughout the tour.
We hope you donate to this opportunity as it has the potential to make a huge impact on so many people and if successful could help combat rape and rape culture which is a huge problem in our society.
Even if you cannot donate we would be very grateful if you could talk about our campaign to your friends swell as sharing our campaign on social media as it is a great opportunity to make a difference in this world.",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>After standing-room-only shows at

compelling play about the precarious state of public education back to the
people who lent us their voices and stories. This October, we’re traveling across the state,
putting on free performances to spark conversations and engage citizens.</p>
<p><i>School Play</i> is a work of grassroots theatre,
woven from the narratives of hundreds of Pennsylvanians affected by our state’s
school funding crisis. The play is entirely crowd-sourced; the script is
derived from the words of students, parents, educators and legislators, and is
available online for anyone to perform.</p>
<p>Artists Arden Kass, Seth Bauer and Edward Sobel
created <i>School Play</i> out of our personal concern for our kids and our

result is a funny, sad, straight-talking documentary theatre piece, told through

The water source will either be from a well or a water catchment system from a fresh water stream on the property that runs year round.  We intend to establish a one acre Monarch Way Station as a sanctuary for the Monarch butterflies; providing a beautiful experience for the children to witness the migration of the Monarch butterflies every year. There are plans to construct a pond on the property where the children will explore pond life and learn how to fish, thus learning biology and basic life skills. Additionally, sheep and goats will be added to the farm, and the students will have lessons on milking and making goat milk soap, shearing sheep, cleaning, dying, and creating yarn from wool. Bees will be kept on the property and the children will have lessons on how to make natural products from the bees wax such as candles, lip balms, and lotions, not to mention the sheer pleasure of eating fresh honey!</p>

They are dedicated to helping each child discover their unique potential academically, socially and interpersonally.  Just as they nurture and grow the plants in their garden, the students are nurtured and blossom into confident and joyful little people. 
The Time to Expand is Now
We have located the perfect property for Roots and Wings Montessori Farm School.  It is set on 52 pristine acres, only seven minutes from three major highways.  We want to continue the vision of Little Sprouts Montessori to meet the existing and increasing demand for a unique and extraordinary early childhood education. We are creating a Montessori-based, ecologically sustainable environmental education program.  Our vision is to renovate the existing 4,615 sq. ft. home into four classrooms with an attached greenhouse. The school will start out with two toddler (18 mo.-3 years) classrooms and two Primary (3 yrs.-6 yrs.) classrooms, adding grades each year until Roots and Wings Montessori Farm School grows to serve children from Pre-K through 12th grade. 
This is model of education is loosely based on Hershey Montessori School in Concord, OH and Nature’s Classroom Institute in Mukwonago, WI. The two story historic barn built in 1885 will be renovated and converted into a multi-use building to be used as an additional classroom for the students, a workshop space for continuing education for  parents, teachers and community; offering classes on yoga, nutrition, and homesteading. The lower level will continue to support stables for the horses. The barn will be historically preserved thereby the children and community at large will be able to appreciate this local historical landmark. The existing stables will be renovated and at least two horses will be acquired for the purpose of offering riding lessons to the students.

The Students Will Work and Run the Farm
""What is learned with joy will not soon be forgotten."" - unknown
The students will be involved in every aspect of running and working the farm.  Up to five acres of land will be devoted to organic farming, including an orchard with apple, peach and pear trees, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and strawberries, grapes, walnut, pecan, almond and hazelnut trees, as well as sugar maples for tapping and making maple syrup with the students. The water source will either be from a well or a water catchment system from a fresh water stream on the property that runs year round.  We intend to establish a one acre Monarch Way Station as a sanctuary for the Monarch butterflies; providing a beautiful experience for the children to witness the migration of the Monarch butterflies every year. There are plans to construct a pond on the property where the children will explore pond life and learn how to fish, thus learning biology and basic life skills. Additionally, sheep and goats will be added to the farm, and the students will have lessons on milking and making goat milk soap, shearing sheep, cleaning, dying, and creating yarn from wool. Bees will be kept on the property and the children will have lessons on how to make natural products from the bees wax such as candles, lip balms, and lotions, not to mention the sheer pleasure of eating fresh honey!

Working to Minimize our Carbon Footprint

""We cannot expect a generation of children that are not connected to the Earth to care about saving her."" - unknown
In addition to being an innovative leader in education, the sustainable Roots and Wings Montessori Farm School will be progressive in its design and stand out as an inspiration to all who visit. The property will harness the suns energy through solar and passive solar energy for all of the buildings, a solar panel garden, geothermal heating and cooling and green technology. The water will be provided by the stream, ponds and a possible well. One of the main objectives of Roots & Wings is to close the child/nature gap and thereby reconnecting children to the source of all life, our Earth, and in turn healing it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The first meeting hardly received any interest, in fact, we only had one visitor. As the club's president, a sophomore in high school with the skills but not the supplies, I didn't believe that SPF Maker Club could succeed. With no funding, it didn't seem feasible, and so an entire summer went by and SPF Maker Club didn't meet. Then, towards the end of the summer, my mother encouraged me to try a Mini Maker Faire in the park near our house. With little enthusiasm, I organized the faire, posted flyers around the town, and on the day of the faire, hunkered down and waited. And what do you know? Forty people showed up!</p>
<p>SPF Make took off from there. For the past two years, we have had monthly Maker meets, participated in the New Jersey Makers Day, gotten our own 3D printer and just last month, got selected as a Maker Camp affiliate site!

But, in the process of organizing our Makers Camp, we have found ourselves faced with raising the money for possibly the most dreaded challenge of all: liability insurance....</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>SPF Make's goal is to keep the Makers Camp as accessible as possible for our local makers. The high school has approved the use of their facilities for the Maker Camp, but they require liability insurance, and the estimated cost is upwards of $1,200! </p>
<p>For a self-funded group, it's either charge our campers $50 a week, or raise the money to cover the costs. All donations to SPF Make will go into lowering the cost of admissions (hopefully to zero!), to give our campers the best, most accessible experience possible. </p>
<p>If SPF Make does not receive enough to run the camp, all donations will go right back to our funders. Contributors - expect great surprises at your doorstep!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The Maker Movement has spread to communities all over world because it strives to verse its youth in technology and innovation, necessities of this day and age. Scotch Plains has a strong school system, but as a community, it lacks in it's drive to get it's hands dirty and break things. Whereas other towns have embraced the Maker Movement, with makerspaces and mini maker faires, Scotch Plains-Fanwood is lagging behind. </p>
<p>The SPF Maker Camp opens all of these opportunities to children in the Scotch Plains (and Fanwood) community and beyond. And most importantly, our goal is to offer it to them for free - to introduce any and every child with the curiosity and the interest, and expose them to a world where creation is at their fingertips and learning is always fun. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Time. We don't have that much time, at all...</p>
<p>The Maker Camp, in all honesty, was a spur of the moment thing. I was on my computer during class (I was supposed to be writing an essay) surfing the internet for something to build for our next Maker Club meeting, and the Maker Camp site showed up. I saw the ""Become an affiliate"" button, filled out the form and promptly forgot about it. Two weeks later, I got an email titled ""Congratulations..."" and the rest is history. </p>
<p>That was also two weeks before school let out. </p>
<p>Now, SPF Make is organizing a summer camp in under four weeks, and there is a good chance that without sufficient funding, we won't be able to offer the full extent of the camp. Liability insurance coverage in such short time remains a risk, however, there's a chance we will make it. The SPF Maker Camp's success rests on our contributors.

</div> <a href=""http://www.helpinghandsaroundtheworld.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Helping Hands Around the World </a>plans to provide a school for under-served children in Biara, Nigeria.  Over the course of the last few years, this part of the world has fallen into increasingly abject poverty.  The average family in the region lives on less than $1 per day.  This is a region where 65% of children receive no primary education, because their families cannot afford to send them to school.  As a result, the cycle of local poverty and poor educational opportunity is deepening.  Today, many children in Ogoniland, Nigeria, do not have an equivalent access to educational opportunities as do their peers in other parts of Nigeria.  A recent research survey in Ogoniland revealed that 40% of Ogoni children do not have any primary education, 60% of Ogoni children do not have access to secondary education, 75% of children do not have college education, and 90% of adults do not have full-time employment.  The lack of access to basic educational facilities and gainful employment is of course related, and it reinforces a continual cycle of deepening poverty in the region -- poor families unable to afford school fees, books, uniforms and shoes for their children produce future generations with access only to more of the same, or worse.  To further worsen the already bad situation, due to a regional teacher strike in the area, there was no schooling in the area at all last year.<p></p><div>To begin to address this situation, The Dookue Memorial School, was established to improve access to a better quality of education for the children of Biara, Ogoniland and build foundations for a better future.  The name of the school honors Chief Dookue Naanee.<br/>
</div><div>The Dookue Memorial School is named for a man who valued education.  Though he did not complete high school, Chief Dookue Naanee knew the value of education.  He helped many families, in Biara, to invest in their children by paying school fees for those children to go to elementary and secondary school.  He even had the opportunity to help with providing funds for college bound students. Chief Dookue was a farmer and made his money from what he produced from his land.  He had five children of his own and all graduated from high school and had opportunities to go to college.  This man was my father.  He had knowledge that went far beyond his education.  He was widely respected by the community he lived in and by the neighboring towns surrounding Biara. Though my father has passed away, before he died his last words to me was to ""take care of the children.""  I believe this project is the epitome of how he felt about children and education.  Since education was very important to him this project goes hand in hand with the support he gave all of his life.  Being his eldest son, I have the utmost respect for all he has done and this school would be a great way to carry on his legacy of making sure each child should have the opportunity to receive an education.<br/>
</div><div>
<p>Dookue Memorial School will also provide a generation of youth in the area the ability to eat healthy meals at the school to guarantee that they are prepared for the learning process, and to provide an atmosphere where the same children are able to learn and develop habits for continuing education.  Dookue Memorial School already has one unimproved building in place, as well as a small staff of teachers and administrators who are ready for the program to launch.  Any funds obtained in this campaign will be used for teacher salaries, nutrition for the students, desks, chairs, educational infrastructure, supplies, and a small number of computers so that the children can be exposed to, and benefit from, high-tech learning tools.</p>
<p><strong>Description of Existing Site, and Plans for the Future</strong></p>
<p>The land and some unimproved structures has been donated for use to the school.  The students of the school will have access to  classrooms, a computer lab, and a library.  Each classroom will have one teacher, and one assistant teacher.  In each classroom, the student body will consist of 30 children between the ages of four and six years.  One kitchen staff and the two assistant teachers will cook, make sure all of the children are fed, and perform cleanup duties.  There will be one administrator and one office staff to keep and maintain records, to promote the vision and mission of the school, and to provide backup for other duties as needed.  The facility has a kitchen and several classrooms, with bathrooms on the first floor.  On the second floor there are eight rooms and two bathrooms for classrooms and storage areas, with an extra room allowing for future expansion of capacity to serve more youth in the area, once the program is in place and fully staffed.</p>
<p>The computer lab will house computer systems so that the students are able to learn, communicate, and familiarize themselves with technological learning tools, sometimes for the first time.  The Learning Center will aid in educating and empowering the youth so that the cycle of poverty as a by-product of an educational lack can come to an end.</p>
<p>Dookue Memorial School will set as the first and most important step towards the transformation of an area that is universally affected by poverty.  Children in the area regularly go from morning until night without food or any kind of nutrition.  Helping Hands recognizes this as a major roadblock of the learning process, and because of that, will have a program in place that will allow for students to receive breakfast and lunch during school days.  This will ensure that our efforts have the most effective possible results, and that the students are properly equipped for a learning environment.</p>
<p>What We Need </p>
<p>Our goal is for $15,000. The funds will be going for supplies and equipment as well as funding the salaries for teachers and administrative staff.  Below is a breakdown of the items we will need.                                                                                  .</p>
<ul>
<li>40 Student desks</li>
<li>40 chairs</li>
<li>Blackboard</li>
<li>Chalk</li>
<li>Whiteboard</li>
<li>Generator</li>
<li>Refrigerator</li>
<li>22 Computers</li>
<li>3 Printers</li>
<li>20 Ipad</li>
<li>Office supplies (office desks, tables, chairs; paper, pencil, paper clips; file folder, etc.)</li>
<li>Staff salaries for 1 year (4 teachers/aides, 2 administrative office staff $125/month), $9,000</li>
<li>Kitchen supplies (pots, pans, trays, etc.) </li>
</ul>
<p>What you Get</p>
<ol>
<li>For a $25.00 contribution - A Helping Hands Around the World wristband.</li>
<li>For a $100.00 contribution - A Helping Hands Around the World T-Shirt.</li>
<li>For a $1000 contribution - A Donor sign with your name on it displayed in the School.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are sure we will reach our goal but if we don't, any contributions received will still be used for the a scaled down version of our project.  This may involve serving less students and hiring less staff with the anticipation that we will be able to increase services at a later time.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Helping Hands Around the World is a nonprofit humanitarian organization dedicated to working with families, children, and the global community in order to allow the children of the world to reach their full potential through economic and educational empowerment.  The goal of our organization is to increase access to quality education in under-served areas, to promote educational wellness, and to empower positive change in communities.  The mission of Helping Hands Around the World is to promote economic empowerment by provisioning funds, goods and services in any part of the world seeking support and financial assistance, to provide access to education to children and families through community-based solutions, and to promote positive change to communities based on awareness of the responsibility to the rest of the world,</p>
<p>Your contribution to Dookue Memorial School will make what was impossible, possible.  You will have the opportunity to help children who would otherwise not have the opportunity to go to school. These children would live in despair and without hope.  This is our chance to help these families break the cycle of poverty.  Your contribution would allow these children to go to a school locally thus providing a great relief for the families who are unable to afford the expense of school let alone the cost of other expenses like food and sometimes room and board.  You will be giving these children a chance to compete with the rest of the world.  The future of our children depends on all of us to help make the future of the world and of our children brighter.  </p>

</div></div>","Helping Hands Around the World plans to provide a school for under-served children in Biara, Nigeria.  Over the course of the last few years, this part of the world has fallen into increasingly abject poverty.  The average family in the region lives on less than $1 per day.  This is a region where 65% of children receive no primary education, because their families cannot afford to send them to school.  As a result, the cycle of local poverty and poor educational opportunity is deepening.  Today, many children in Ogoniland, Nigeria, do not have an equivalent access to educational opportunities as do their peers in other parts of Nigeria.  A recent research survey in Ogoniland revealed that 40% of Ogoni children do not have any primary education, 60% of Ogoni children do not have access to secondary education, 75% of children do not have college education, and 90% of adults do not have full-time employment.  The lack of access to basic educational facilities and gainful employment is of course related, and it reinforces a continual cycle of deepening poverty in the region -- poor families unable to afford school fees, books, uniforms and shoes for their children produce future generations with access only to more of the same, or worse.  To further worsen the already bad situation, due to a regional teacher strike in the area, there was no schooling in the area at all last year.To begin to address this situation, The Dookue Memorial School, was established to improve access to a better quality of education for the children of Biara, Ogoniland and build foundations for a better future.  The name of the school honors Chief Dookue Naanee.
The Dookue Memorial School is named for a man who valued education.  Though he did not complete high school, Chief Dookue Naanee knew the value of education.  He helped many families, in Biara, to invest in their children by paying school fees for those children to go to elementary and secondary school.  He even had the opportunity to help with providing funds for college bound students. Chief Dookue was a farmer and made his money from what he produced from his land.  He had five children of his own and all graduated from high school and had opportunities to go to college.  This man was my father.  He had knowledge that went far beyond his education.  He was widely respected by the community he lived in and by the neighboring towns surrounding Biara. Though my father has passed away, before he died his last words to me was to ""take care of the children.""  I believe this project is the epitome of how he felt about children and education.  Since education was very important to him this project goes hand in hand with the support he gave all of his life.  Being his eldest son, I have the utmost respect for all he has done and this school would be a great way to carry on his legacy of making sure each child should have the opportunity to receive an education.

Dookue Memorial School will also provide a generation of youth in the area the ability to eat healthy meals at the school to guarantee that they are prepared for the learning process, and to provide an atmosphere where the same children are able to learn and develop habits for continuing education.  Dookue Memorial School already has one unimproved building in place, as well as a small staff of teachers and administrators who are ready for the program to launch.  Any funds obtained in this campaign will be used for teacher salaries, nutrition for the students, desks, chairs, educational infrastructure, supplies, and a small number of computers so that the children can be exposed to, and benefit from, high-tech learning tools.
Description of Existing Site, and Plans for the Future
The land and some unimproved structures has been donated for use to the school.  The students of the school will have access to  classrooms, a computer lab, and a library.  Each classroom will have one teacher, and one assistant teacher.  In each classroom, the student body will consist of 30 children between the ages of four and six years.  One kitchen staff and the two assistant teachers will cook, make sure all of the children are fed, and perform cleanup duties.  There will be one administrator and one office staff to keep and maintain records, to promote the vision and mission of the school, and to provide backup for other duties as needed.  The facility has a kitchen and several classrooms, with bathrooms on the first floor.  On the second floor there are eight rooms and two bathrooms for classrooms and storage areas, with an extra room allowing for future expansion of capacity to serve more youth in the area, once the program is in place and fully staffed.
The computer lab will house computer systems so that the students are able to learn, communicate, and familiarize themselves with technological learning tools, sometimes for the first time.  The Learning Center will aid in educating and empowering the youth so that the cycle of poverty as a by-product of an educational lack can come to an end.
Dookue Memorial School will set as the first and most important step towards the transformation of an area that is universally affected by poverty.  Children in the area regularly go from morning until night without food or any kind of nutrition.  Helping Hands recognizes this as a major roadblock of the learning process, and because of that, will have a program in place that will allow for students to receive breakfast and lunch during school days.  This will ensure that our efforts have the most effective possible results, and that the students are properly equipped for a learning environment.
What We Need 
Our goal is for $15,000. The funds will be going for supplies and equipment as well as funding the salaries for teachers and administrative staff.  Below is a breakdown of the items we will need.                                                                                  .

40 Student desks
40 chairs
Blackboard
Chalk
Whiteboard
Generator
Refrigerator
22 Computers
3 Printers
20 Ipad
Office supplies (office desks, tables, chairs; paper, pencil, paper clips; file folder, etc.)
Staff salaries for 1 year (4 teachers/aides, 2 administrative office staff $125/month), $9,000
Kitchen supplies (pots, pans, trays, etc.) 

What you Get

For a $25.00 contribution - A Helping Hands Around the World wristband.
For a $100.00 contribution - A Helping Hands Around the World T-Shirt.
For a $1000 contribution - A Donor sign with your name on it displayed in the School.

We are sure we will reach our goal but if we don't, any contributions received will still be used for the a scaled down version of our project.  This may involve serving less students and hiring less staff with the anticipation that we will be able to increase services at a later time.
The Impact
Helping Hands Around the World is a nonprofit humanitarian organization dedicated to working with families, children, and the global community in order to allow the children of the world to reach their full potential through economic and educational empowerment.  The goal of our organization is to increase access to quality education in under-served areas, to promote educational wellness, and to empower positive change in communities.  The mission of Helping Hands Around the World is to promote economic empowerment by provisioning funds, goods and services in any part of the world seeking support and financial assistance, to provide access to education to children and families through community-based solutions, and to promote positive change to communities based on awareness of the responsibility to the rest of the world,
Your contribution to Dookue Memorial School will make what was impossible, possible.  You will have the opportunity to help children who would otherwise not have the opportunity to go to school. These children would live in despair and without hope.  This is our chance to help these families break the cycle of poverty.  Your contribution would allow these children to go to a school locally thus providing a great relief for the families who are unable to afford the expense of school let alone the cost of other expenses like food and sometimes room and board.  You will be giving these children a chance to compete with the rest of the world.  The future of our children depends on all of us to help make the future of the world and of our children brighter.

<p>We are a non profit organisation that teaches English and
life skills to students from poor backgrounds in Cambodia.  We are part of SOLS 24/7, a non profit school that has over 200 students.   We urgently need to upgrade and replace some of our school equipment.   The funds raised will be used to replace our projector, broken computers, and for essential building maintenance.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<div>You get the chance to help others.  I believe helping goes around and around.  Many people have helped me during my life.  Most of the people that have helped me don't need my help and I can feel a bit bad about this until I realise that I can help others.  Even a small donation will help.</div>

</div><div> <p></p>
<p>The students in our program gain English language and life skills.  These are key to helping them improve their lives and gain good jobs.</p>
<p>The school does wonderful things with very little money.  I have been volunteering as an English teacher at Sols for 2 months and I have seen the changes the program has made to my students.  Both their English and their confidence have improved.  I can help change their lives for the better and so can you.  Please give a little so we have the resources to continue our work.   In a country where the average income is less than $40 per week we need a helping hand. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There are no real risks and challenges.  All the money donated will go on purchasing this new equipment and essential building maintenance.</p>
<p>The education we are providing our students will help them out of the poverty trap and mean they can become independent citizens and gain well paid employment. </p>

We are a non profit organisation that teaches English and
life skills to students from poor backgrounds in Cambodia.  We are part of SOLS 24/7, a non profit school that has over 200 students.   We urgently need to upgrade and replace some of our school equipment.   The funds raised will be used to replace our projector, broken computers, and for essential building maintenance.

What You Get
You get the chance to help others.  I believe helping goes around and around.  Many people have helped me during my life.  Most of the people that have helped me don't need my help and I can feel a bit bad about this until I realise that I can help others.  Even a small donation will help.
The Impact
 
The students in our program gain English language and life skills.  These are key to helping them improve their lives and gain good jobs.
The school does wonderful things with very little money.  I have been volunteering as an English teacher at Sols for 2 months and I have seen the changes the program has made to my students.  Both their English and their confidence have improved.  I can help change their lives for the better and so can you.  Please give a little so we have the resources to continue our work.   In a country where the average income is less than $40 per week we need a helping hand. 

Risks & Challenges There are no real risks and challenges.  All the money donated will go on purchasing this new equipment and essential building maintenance.
The education we are providing our students will help them out of the poverty trap and mean they can become independent citizens and gain well paid employment. 
 

What else can you do
If you cannot donate please help by;  Getting the word out and make some noise about your campaign.

triggers and cues and replace them with new positive habits.  The Life Connect tools are integrated with
Zoey, our Virtual Health Assistant, and she provides ongoing encouragement and
feedback, while assigning the client new tasks throughout the
day.  This disrupts the old thinking and
creates new positive patterns.  Family,

<p>Live Well- H.E.A.L will promote the recently passed H.E.A.L
resolution, Let’s Move national initiative and will expose participants to
healthy eating and active living activities. This track will have a municipal
impact due to the fact that if focus on health which is an area that the City
of Hopewell scores poorly in within the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>What’s Next? Will focus on “life after high school” and will
feature recent HHA graduates. Breakout sessions will explore how to deal with
real-life situations as recent graduates come into adulthood. This track will
impact the areas of focus that the City of Hopewell as a municipality currently
does not have programs to support.</p>
<p> Reach Higher will promote
the national initiative “Reach Higher” that inspired every student in America
to take charge of their future by completing education past high school,
whether at a professional training program, a community college, or a four-year
college or university. This track will also feature alternative options such as
vocational school or military service. The goal of “Reach Higher” is for that
by 2020, America will once again have the highest proportion of college
graduates in the world. This track will have a municipal impact due to the fact
that per the 2010 Census, the City of Hopewell educational attainment post High
School graduation is low, to include very few residents that have obtained
Bachelors’ degrees. Moreover, statistics prove that the industries the majority
of Hopewell residents have careers in are non-STEM related, which is opposite
of national workforce trends. The goal of this track is to inspire youth to
fill 21st century jobs that may fill the skills gap within the City of
Hopewell.</p>
<p>The Real World will promote the national initiative “Ready
By 21” which focuses on building youth to be ready for the real world by early
adulthood. This track will feature sessions that will teach real life skills
such as managing funds, leasing apartments/cars, traveling, etc. One session in
particular will feature the “Complete Streets” initiative, which was recently
adopted by City Council. This session will have a municipal impact because
feedback can be used for the Comprehensive Plan. In addition, feedback will
help support the H.E.A.L Committees mission.</p>
<p>Making Money will promote the national initiatives “Startup
America”, which promotes entrepreneurship and “TechHire” which focuses on STEM
and filling/creating jobs for the 21st century. Moreover, this track will
feature sessions that teach skills to help youth and young adults land and keep
jobs. The track has a municipal impact because it promotes business startups,
and building a solid workforce within the City of Hopewell.</p>
<p>Get Social will promote interpersonal skills, and expose
participates to networking and the realities of social media usage.</p>

<h2 style=""display: inline !important;""><b>Why We're Asking for Your Help:<br/></b></h2>
<p><b><b><b></b></b></b></p>
<p>Since we opened in November 2015, we’ve grown from taking in one child to 22 children to date. Unfortunately, we cannot take in any more children due to the lack of funding needed to continue growing by fixing the dilapidated school building conditions, providing stable school electricity, running water, building renovation, classroom furnishing, expanding classrooms and providing school supplies.</p>
<p><b>A Brief
Introduction:</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Hello, my name is Chavey Prince. I am a Clinical Social
Worker and Psychotherapist. I reside in Seattle Washington. I am a wife and mom of
two little daughters, ages five and under. 
I hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology and a Master’s Degree in
Clinical Social Work from the University of Houston.  While living in Houston, Texas, I worked with elementary,
middle and high school age children at the local school district  level and  with various philanthropic organizations, companies and
social work agencies to provide children in low income Houston neighborhoods
with safe, free after school community facilities where they can play, read,
have access to free internet for home work research and in some cases, also
provide free hot meals.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>My Passion:
Providing Basic Education for Poor Children, One Child at a Time!</b></p>
<p>I have always had the passion to help children in developing
countries accomplish their educational goals. Current research shows a
significant disparity between children here in the United States and children
in developing countries when it comes to basic educational access and
necessities required for early childhood development. I made it my personal
endeavor to do my part in aiding with the development of a basic educational
and learning environmental framework for poor children in African countries.</p>
<p><b>Background and Research: </b><b>The Big Problem</b></p>
<p> According to UNICEF
report,  40% of Nigerian children aged
6-11 do not attend primary school, with the Northern region recording the
lowest school attendance rate in the country, particularly for girls.  It is not rare to see cases of 100 pupils per
teacher or students sitting under trees outside the school building because of
the lack of classrooms. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455645180/ovpzfww9k02tilircjil.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The lowest rates of school participation are found in Western and Central Africa and South Asia - See more at: <a href=""http://data.unicef.org/education/primary.html#sthash.Cr1EH5zE.dpuf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://data.unicef.org/education/primary.html#s..</a>
</div><div>
<br/>
<p><b><i>A Strong Educational Foundation is the Key to Future Success for All Children!</i></b><b></b></p>
<p>Other research indicates that despite a significant increase
in net enrollment rates in recent years, it is estimated that about 4.7 million
children of primary school age are still not in school.  The compulsory, free Universal Basic
Education (UBE) Act was passed into Nigerian law in 2004 and represents the
Government’s strategy to fight illiteracy and extend basic education
opportunities to all children in the country. However, the number of schools,
facilities and teachers available for basic education remain inadequate for the
eligible number of children and youths. This is more so in urban areas where
there is population pressure. Under these conditions, teaching and learning
cannot be effective; hence the outcomes are usually below expectation.</p>
<p>In Enugu, Nigeria this disparity exists among children and
youth coupled with a dire need for basic school infrastructure and supplies.  Quality educational opportunities are only accessible to those who can afford it, while a vast
majority of the local population are poor hard working folks. Basic quality
education is unattainable for the children within these low/ no income
families and in some cases impossible to achieve.</p>
<p><b> Here's What We've Done So Far</b></p>
<p>Last year, we partnered with Prof. Gloria Agbaroji. PhD, a
retired ex - high school principal and college professor in Enugu who has
worked over the past 30 years within the Nigerian educational system to ensure
children from low income to poor rural areas have opportunities to obtain  basic
school educational needs. </p>

 </p>
<p>Together, we’ve established Prince Academy.  Prince Academy is a day care, nursery and primary
school located in Enugu, Nigeria, established in November of 2015.  </p>
<p>We provide an educational, creative and
nurturing environment for children from poor/low-income and struggling  families in our
community.  Recently, we successfully
acquired some new additional school space in an old office building (built in 1978) in need of major repairs. We've been self-funding <span style=""background-color: initial;"">some of desperately needed repair work</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> while also managing the daily functioning of the Academy. However, with depleted funds, we're unable to continue pushing forward. This is where we need your help and kind generosity.</span></p>

<p>Lack of reliable clean water supply also makes it really challenging for our school children during school hours. The children have to use water from water storage containers for flushing restroom toilets. </p>

Since we opened in November 2015, we’ve grown from taking in one child to 22 children to date. Unfortunately, we cannot take in any more children due to the lack of funding needed to continue growing by fixing the dilapidated school building conditions, providing stable school electricity, running water, building renovation, classroom furnishing, expanding classrooms and providing school supplies.
A Brief
Introduction:
Hello, my name is Chavey Prince. I am a Clinical Social
Worker and Psychotherapist. I reside in Seattle Washington. I am a wife and mom of
two little daughters, ages five and under. 
I hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology and a Master’s Degree in
Clinical Social Work from the University of Houston.  While living in Houston, Texas, I worked with elementary,
middle and high school age children at the local school district  level and  with various philanthropic organizations, companies and
social work agencies to provide children in low income Houston neighborhoods
with safe, free after school community facilities where they can play, read,
have access to free internet for home work research and in some cases, also
provide free hot meals.
My Passion:
Providing Basic Education for Poor Children, One Child at a Time!
I have always had the passion to help children in developing
countries accomplish their educational goals. Current research shows a
significant disparity between children here in the United States and children
in developing countries when it comes to basic educational access and
necessities required for early childhood development. I made it my personal
endeavor to do my part in aiding with the development of a basic educational
and learning environmental framework for poor children in African countries.
Background and Research: The Big Problem
 According to UNICEF
report,  40% of Nigerian children aged
6-11 do not attend primary school, with the Northern region recording the
lowest school attendance rate in the country, particularly for girls.  It is not rare to see cases of 100 pupils per
teacher or students sitting under trees outside the school building because of
the lack of classrooms. 

The lowest rates of school participation are found in Western and Central Africa and South Asia - See more at: http://data.unicef.org/education/primary.html#s..


A Strong Educational Foundation is the Key to Future Success for All Children!
Other research indicates that despite a significant increase
in net enrollment rates in recent years, it is estimated that about 4.7 million
children of primary school age are still not in school.  The compulsory, free Universal Basic
Education (UBE) Act was passed into Nigerian law in 2004 and represents the
Government’s strategy to fight illiteracy and extend basic education
opportunities to all children in the country. However, the number of schools,
facilities and teachers available for basic education remain inadequate for the
eligible number of children and youths. This is more so in urban areas where
there is population pressure. Under these conditions, teaching and learning
cannot be effective; hence the outcomes are usually below expectation.
In Enugu, Nigeria this disparity exists among children and
youth coupled with a dire need for basic school infrastructure and supplies.  Quality educational opportunities are only accessible to those who can afford it, while a vast
majority of the local population are poor hard working folks. Basic quality
education is unattainable for the children within these low/ no income
families and in some cases impossible to achieve.
 Here's What We've Done So Far
Last year, we partnered with Prof. Gloria Agbaroji. PhD, a
retired ex - high school principal and college professor in Enugu who has
worked over the past 30 years within the Nigerian educational system to ensure
children from low income to poor rural areas have opportunities to obtain  basic
school educational needs. 

 
Together, we’ve established Prince Academy.  Prince Academy is a day care, nursery and primary
school located in Enugu, Nigeria, established in November of 2015.  
We provide an educational, creative and
nurturing environment for children from poor/low-income and struggling  families in our
community.  Recently, we successfully
acquired some new additional school space in an old office building (built in 1978) in need of major repairs. We've been self-funding some of desperately needed repair work while also managing the daily functioning of the Academy. However, with depleted funds, we're unable to continue pushing forward. This is where we need your help and kind generosity.



  Hello! From Our Staff, Teachers and School Children at Prince Academy -February 2016.                


We've Done a Lot In a Short Time!
  But We Still Have More to Do!
In order to
transform our school into a safe, conducive environment that fosters
progressive and cognitive learning for our school children, we desperately need your
backing to help us renovate our school.  A great accomplishment we thought unachievable
in such a short period of time. 

How Your Contributions Will Help Us:We'll stretch every dollar you contribute to ensure we are able to complete the needed work detailed below.  

Exterior Repairs Needed – Make School Clean and Safe for the Kids!










We need your
help to fix and renovate our school infrastructure. We'd also like to provide a safe and clean outside play area for our school children.




We have water damaged and missing ceiling tiles/boards and our roof leaks. When it rains, water gets into our building.
We need roof repairs, repainting, replacement of missing/broken windows, window screens to help keep out mosquitoes and proper school signage. 

Basic Stable Electricity & Water – Help Needed!
Due to extremely unreliable city electricity power supply, we usually don’t have any electricity during the hot school day. With no working fans or lights, we usually have windows open to ensure we have adequate lighting and ventilation for the children however, doing this can also let in mosquitoes which can transmit malaria exposing the children to illness.   A battery back-up off grid solar power system will allow us to provide our school with the clean stable electricity needed to power basic school equipment such as fans and lighting.



Lack of reliable clean water supply also makes it really challenging for our school children during school hours. The children have to use water from water storage containers for flushing restroom toilets. 





We’ll need a water well constructed and water a pumping system to ensure with our school's growth, more school children can have access to proper running water and clean hygienic restrooms during school.

Day Care & Nursery School Space

With your
help, we can transform the space for our daycare and nursery school babies,From This:

For the toddlers, we can transform their classrooms from these:









To this (concept):




Primary School Space

Your kind contributions will go a long way in helping us build and furnish more classrooms. 
We have small full classrooms




More Classrooms - Help Needed!
We have space to build more new classrooms in order to take in and teach more children from the community. 






 What You Get for Helping Us Out:

 To show our enormous appreciation and gratitude to you for kindly being gracious in helping our effort, we've come up with some exciting  fun perks for you.
 In addition to fun perks, you'll receive monthly project updates and status reports of ongoing work (Documentation & Pictures) If we are unable to reach our funding goal, we intend to accomplish all the work we can with the funds you contribute and provide project updates of our accomplishments.
Any excess funding we receive would go towards hiring more staff and saving for a school van to allow us transport our school children to various out door school activities such as museum trips, zoo trips etc.



The Impact of Your Contributions:

Your contributions will help color a bright future for our school children by providing an educational foundation not just for our current school children, but also for a lot more children who will attend our school in the future. 

A Solid Educational Foundation is the Key to Future Success for All Children!  For a lot of poor children, educational opportunities help lay the frame work for creating a way out of poverty.
Education is not only beneficial in drastically reducing poverty, but also aids with building a more successful economy and creating a successful pipeline for further generations to come.
Established and successfully opened (Literacy for Allen Parkway Village) a library for young children and adolescence in Forth Ward located in Houston, Texas. Education is substantial in guiding our children to become self reliant, stable and contributing citizens of society. 
  


Risks & Challenges

Challenges: Through diligent planning, estimation and the execution of the project, we’ll be on track to complete our education project in an efficient and timely manner. However, with almost every project, there presents challenges in terms of controlling cost, scope and schedule while delivering quality.
We have the collective expertise/experience needed to be successful with this project.
Risk: Not reaching full funding.  Without reaching full funding, we shall not be able to deliver the completed project.  In the case that this may happen, we will consolidate our planning goals, but
we shall continue to stay optimistic and provide our students with the best
educational foundation possible.
Risk:  Not being able to receive, store and ship locally contributed materials. 
If  you’re a local contributor or backer here in Washington State and you’d rather help us by donating books, desks, computers, back packs, chairs or any other materials a school would require, we would need some help with the pick up of local donations, the storage of the donations and the shipment of the donations. Please contact me for more details. 
  Other Ways You Can Help 
We kindly
accept donations and if any local contributors in Enugu would prefer to donate their time to
helping us on the ground, we would be more than happy to accept any on the
ground help we can get. If interested, please contact me for
more details and information.  Also, Tweet us @princeacademye1 or find us on Facebook www.facebook.com/educationforimpoverishedchildr... Youtube: https://youtu.be/_xRW6JkW9ZI

</div>
<p>The  Transylvanian  Experimental  Neuroscience  Summer  School 
 (TENSS)  was  born  in  2010, from an idea that Florin Albeanu shared 
to Raul Mureşan during a conference in Romania. The first edition of 
TENSS took place in 2012, on the shores of Pike Lake, in the picturesque
 province of Transylvania. In 2014, TENSS  has welcomed  a  third 
permanent organizer, Adam Kampff, from the University College London, UK.</p><p>The  main  objective  of  TENSS  is  to 
 provide  participants  top-level,  hands-on training  in experimental 
 techniques  used  in  neuroscience. The philosophy of the school is learning
 by doing and while doing so, openly sharing ideas and expertise. To 
 the  best  of  our  knowledge  the  opportunity  for  such  training 
 is scarce and is covered only in a few places in the world, such as 
Cold Spring Harbor and Woods Hole, in the USA, Plymouth in UK, Champalimaud in Portugal and Okinawa, Japan. TENSS 
is unique in that most of the experimental (hardware and software) tools
 are assembled from scratch, with minimal costs leading to a deeply 
personal transfer of information from first principles. </p><p>The
 course takes place in a remote, picturesque location in Transylvania, 
where high level technology seems to be out of place. Participants get actively involved in building a
 laboratory from scratch and then have the chance to use it too. Such an experience can 
convince any researcher that everything is possible in science and that 
financial and concept limitations are easily overcome by creativity and 
knowledge. </p><p></p><p><i>""I came here with almost no knowledge on experimental techniques in neuroscience and I now feel that I have a good overview of a large variety of them. I come back with a lot of ideas and with much less frontiers or fear in implementing any of the techniques that we learned at the school. The environment of freedom, the feeling that we can do whatever we want, the fact that this freedom leads to being very creative and having amzing new ideas, the flexibility of the organizers that allow for this, this is what I liked most of TENSS.

Florin Albeanu, Raul Muresan and Adam Kampff –
 We are scientists investigating how the brain works (when healthy) and
 doesn't work (when ill). We 
are trying to inspire and train the neuroscientists of the future, to 
provide them with the best chance to solve the mysteries of the brain, 
to discover how we perceive, think, decide, act, and understand the 
world and ourselves; and to offer real hope for a cure of the brain’s 
devastating maladies, ranging from ALS, Schizophrenia and Parkinson's to Alzheimer’s disease.Our Cause
We have started a worldwide initiative to train young brain researchers, from both poor and developed countries, in understanding and using the most advanced tools in brain research
today. We do this in Transylvania!This is TENSS, the Transylvanian Experimental Neuroscience
Summer School:


3 weeks of 24/7 hands-on practical and theoretical
     courses in building, debugging, using and interpreting data from
     cutting-edge experimental methods in modern neuroscience.
A select group of the best applicants: for the 2015 edition, top 12 were selected from an excellent pool of 150
     applicants from all over the world – 42 countries across 6 continents.
A wide collection of experts: 20 instructors and 12
     dedicated teaching assistants from Brain research institutes in the USA,
     UK, Germany, Denmark, Portugal, Romania, India, Switzerland, Norway,
     Netherlands, Hungary and Slovakia.

A knowledge base of Open-Source solutions to complex
     problems in brain research, providing an alternative to the expensive
     commercial systems.

My name is Shaya Ishaq and I'm a 22 year old art student from Ottawa, Ontario! I moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia two years ago to attend NSCAD University where I study textile design and ceramics. This summer I have the opportunity to work as a intern for a clothing company that I've admired for years named Osei Duro. They are quite selective so being chosen to join their team is a privilege that I am truly proud of. Without a doubt, this is one of the best opportunities to come my way so I am incredibly excited to embark on this promising adventure!ABOUT OSEI DUROOsei Duro was founded in 2009 by Molly Keogh and Maryanne Mathias, Based in Los Angeles, California and Accra, Ghana, they produce their textiles garments in Ghana where they apply traditional hand dyeing and weaving techniques. By working with local garment workers and artisans, they are supporting the local apparel industry on both a large and small scale.  I am over the moon to be contributing to a fashion line whose mandate works towards a vibrant fashion industry! One that exceeds international production standards while respecting the rights, traditions and aesthetics of local Ghanaian makers!
Why this means the world to me!
I am so excited and honoured to have a role in the inner workings of an innovative, sustainable and continuously refreshing clothing brand that stands by an ethos that I truly believe in! There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this opportunity will expand my horizons in ways that would not be possible within my art school. This internship will give me the chance to take a major step in my design practice. It will allow me to apply skills I've acquired as a textiles student in a hands on environment and build off what I've learned in school. 
Working for a company with sustainability at the core of its values is very important to me. Osei Duro goes beyond  ""fashion for fashion's sake"". They are a socially responsible company aware of the footprint they leave and impact they have on communities in Ghana.Although this opportunity is a dream come true, the financial realities of making it happen can't be ignored. I would like to raise funds to help me cover my travel costs and part of my living expenses while living in Accra this summer through this campaign!
   Why do I need your support? As a full time student, who funds their education 100% of the way, it can be a never ending hustle just to make ends meet and balance school. I work part-time during the academic year and run my own small business, Mild Eyes, on the side but even so, I don't not have enough personal savings to help me get to Ghana.By the time I was offered the position, the deadline to apply for a student travel subsidy had passed. Similarly, deadlines to apply for scholarships or grants had passed of I didn't have enough time to apply on short notice. I know in my heart that going away for this internship is meant to be but I want to avoid going in debt to make it happen!I am hoping to raise $4500 through this campaign to help me cover the cost of my plane ticket, my living expenses, and a modest daily budget for three months in Accra.

What's in it for you?I'm really excited to share these perks with you guys! I've worked really hard to make some ceramics and textile based goods in exchange for your contributions. This will be a great opportunity for people who have seen my work on my Instagram to treat themselves to something they've liked all the while knowing that your contributions are helping me fund an important event in my life. I've also joined forces with some incredibly supportive local businesses from my hometown in Ottawa who have offered some sweet giveaways!  Victoire Boutique and GOODS have some wonderful perks up for grabs so check them out on the gallery page of this campaing!Even if I don't reach my entire goal, the funds raised through this will bring me one step closer to getting to Ghana for my summer internship.

</div></div>","Summary I discovered the outdoors when i was a kid. I started with fishing, then hiking. As a teenager i did a lot of camping with my friends and took it to the next level - rock climbing.
This formed my character. I learned about sustainability, friendship, nature and basic life principles.   
Now, a father myself, i also take my son fishing and camping. doing this and looking at my son, made me realize what impact nature can have on a little individual and how i can use this to help others.
After almost an year of brainstorming, my wife, her father and I agreed on what needs to be done to actually make that thought come to life.
This is phase one of the project, where we want to raise money to put together a non-profit organization, to help kids from not so fortunate families (poor, single parent, etc.) and give them a fair fighting chance to do something with their lives. Give them access to what the most of us take for granted - education, love and support. 
And we want to do this using mother nature. But this is phase 2...




What We Need As in any other country on this planet, bureaucracy can be a show stopper to anything you are trying to accomplish, hence we need professional help.Professional help means a lawyer, that can help us navigate the narrow and twisted wording found in the local laws, and get to our end scope - non-profit organization.As we all know, lawyers cost money, and even if 1000$ might now seems like a big amount for others, for us, here in Romania, can sometimes be a fortune.
The money we raise here, plus our own financial effort will be invested in:- create a non profit organization- build a website- draft a project to access EU (European Union) founds for phase two.If we manage to do this, we move to phase two.Phase two, without going into more details, requires accessing EU funding (300k $) to build an outdoor camp.
If we do not manage to do this, raise the 1000$, we will not stop. We will keep on trying until we have the organization in place, and dedicate our time to find alternative ways for funding.
Impact
We know it is impossible to change the world, and we know we cannot help all the children in need, but if we managed to do so with some, who knows what happens. Maybe the next Einstein will be found, or the new great composer of our time, the doctor that will cure cancer.Without access to information, education and well being, natural talent can be easily lost.100. This is our target for the first 2 years. At least 100 hundred children, from underprivileged families, with no possibility to pursuit an academic institution, or cannot afford one. Identify what they are good at, what do they like to do, offer professional support. Teach them basic life principles, give them access to all the things OUR children take for granted - TV, Internet, toys, etc. - and teach them how they can use it, how are they built. There are no limits and no barriers - we built them, and only we can take them down.


Risks & Challenges Not raising the money in time to access the EU funding.No support from the local authorities
No money to donate? You can still help.
 We need anything you can spare, as it is not all about the money.For example, If you can build a website, we save money in paying someone to do it for us.  Or you already have experience working in a non-profit organization, share you knowledge.

<ol><li><b> Background and Experience</b></li></ol>
<ol>I was

<b>Who we are:</b></p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 150%;"">
The International
Professional Soccer Academy (IPSA) is a unique soccer school. Our
goal is to prepare students physically, mentally, and emotionally for
the disciplined life of an elite soccer player and provide them with
access to higher levels of soccer.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 150%;"">
At IPSA, we don’t just
train. We educate players of the beautiful game. Soccer skills
training is a core part of our curriculum but so is
character-building and life skills training. Our students develop
speed and agility, self-confidence, and sportsmanship while learning
to love the sport and excel in it. Our students and their families
also learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style=""margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 150%;"">
	Eat healthy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 150%;"">
	Be disciplined</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 150%;"">
	Stay safe on the field,
	off the field, on the internet, and out in their communities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 150%;"">
	Handle money, establish
	budgets, and become financially literate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 150%;"">
	Prepare for college and
	college application requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 150%;"">

</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 0.04in; margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 150%;"">
These skills, and the
discipline they learn, prepare our students for success in college
athletics and in life.

<b>What we need:</b></p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"">We
want to completely change the perception of youth soccer training and
education in the United States, starting with Central Florida.
Through the IPSA model, we want to produce healthier, stronger,
better-skilled and technically advanced players. 
</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 150%;"">
Our first year of
operation has been a huge success. Our Academy brought together <span style="""">60
</span>children
and families from across Lake County, Florida. Together, we’ve
competed in <span style="""">13</span>
tournaments and earned <span style="""">8
</span>championship
and finalists medals. More importantly, every one of our players has
improved drastically in their soccer skills. Our players are demonstrating a true
understanding of the game and impressive ball-handling skills. The few players with physical challenges are showing great improvement in
their running skills and body movements and our shy players are
showing initiative and drive. All are demonstrating commitment and
love for the sport.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0.07in; line-height: 150%;"">
Moving forward, our
immediate priorities are to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style=""margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"">
	Sponsor young, talented
	players from low-income families who otherwise could not afford the
	high fees for local clubs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"">
	Subsidize training for up
	to 140 IPSA Cadets – our new
	program designed to introduce novice U6 – U9 players to the sport
	and begin developing their skills and technique in a fun environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"">
	Fund our high school
	players’ college preparatory courses and college visitation trips,
	and gather game footage for their college recruiting 
	</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style=""margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"">Longer-term,
we are working to grow the Academy strategically. We are not aiming
for explosive expansion; we are seeking qualitative growth with a
manageable number of students who we can fully support with
personalized training from highly experienced staff. This means
establishing processes for, and funding, effective screening, hiring,
educating, and licensing of coaches.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"">We
know and understand that soccer is a growing sport in our country. We
also know that our Academy concept is still very new to the United
States but a proven method in Europe. We are constantly working to
educate the community on how other countries consistently produce
higher skilled players, demonstrating that the IPSA model of training
is the way forward. We are prepared to move slowly but effectively,
producing high quality players. 
</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 0.07in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 150%;"">We’ve
grown our Academy by word of mouth, visiting local schools, hosting
soccer camps, and inviting prospective students to try out our school
free of charge. Eventually, it is those young players who have made a
conscious decision to play soccer at an elite level who will find a
home at IPSA. IPSA’s holistic training perspective and commitment
to player development will make the difference.</p>

17 years as a college coach before moving to Central Florida in 2011 to
continue my coaching at the USA National Training Center as the
Director of the Soccer Academy. Just over a year ago I started my own
Academy, International Pro Soccer Academy Inc.       While in college I was voted NCCAA Region Coach of the Year. I produced         numerous NSCAA Academic AllAmericas, NSCAA All-America players and also MLS draftees who played professionally for MLS and USL teams (Columbus Crew, CharlotteEagles, Tampa Bay Rowdies) and also in England (Stockport County). As Director of National Training Center, with over 400 registered youthplayers I was also Head Coach of the NTC Phoenix, a WPSL team inwhich I produced players that went on to play in France and nowin England, (Liverpool Ladies), and here in the USA (Boston BreakersWPL).3. Campaign Goal:
Extend IPSA’s uniquesoccer education to children across Central Florida and ensure itremains accessible to all families.



Campaign Goal:

Extend IPSA’s unique
soccer education to children across Central Florida and ensure it
remains accessible to all families.

Who we are:

The International
Professional Soccer Academy (IPSA) is a unique soccer school. Our
goal is to prepare students physically, mentally, and emotionally for
the disciplined life of an elite soccer player and provide them with
access to higher levels of soccer.

At IPSA, we don’t just
train. We educate players of the beautiful game. Soccer skills
training is a core part of our curriculum but so is
character-building and life skills training. Our students develop
speed and agility, self-confidence, and sportsmanship while learning
to love the sport and excel in it. Our students and their families
also learn how to:



	Eat healthy



	Be disciplined



	Stay safe on the field,
	off the field, on the internet, and out in their communities



	Handle money, establish
	budgets, and become financially literate



	Prepare for college and
	college application requirements



	Become socially
	responsible



These skills, and the
discipline they learn, prepare our students for success in college
athletics and in life. 


The IPSA model is unique
and superior to the standard American soccer clubs’ approach to
training:




Approach
			to Soccer Training


Standard
			Soccer Clubs


The
			IPSA Model




Develop
			students’ general understanding of how soccer is played
			including formation and positional plays


















Develop
			students’ soccer skills and technical abilities 
			


















Develop
			students’ deep, intrinsic desire to succeed in the sport and in
			life by emphasizing effort and discipline 
			















Develop
			each student to his or her fullest potential through
			individualized training















Instill
			discipline in areas that foster long-term success in the sport and
			in life (nutrition, college preparedness, internet safety) through
			formal classroom instruction















Facilitate
			networking opportunities for older students (connect with college
			coaches, other leagues, and the professional soccer world)















Provide
			students direct access to elite levels through associations with
			FIFA-licensed agencies















Ensure
			students are on par with their European Academy counterparts both
			as players and in their understanding of the latest training
			trends 
			















Train
			students to play in league games every weekend – a short-term
			motivation risking fatigue and injury among players















Compete
			in tournaments once a month – a long-term focus providing
			students with competitive experiences without pressure for league
			results
















Our
priority is developing each player to his or her fullest potential.
Students receive field and classroom instruction each week from
qualified coaches and specialists. We use scientifically proven
methods like periodization to minimize fatigue and injury, and our
students only compete in local tournaments once a month. Our priority
is not to fill trophy cases. It’s to fill the sport with
well-rounded individuals and world-class players.

What we need:
We
want to completely change the perception of youth soccer training and
education in the United States, starting with Central Florida.
Through the IPSA model, we want to produce healthier, stronger,
better-skilled and technically advanced players. 


Our first year of
operation has been a huge success. Our Academy brought together 60
children
and families from across Lake County, Florida. Together, we’ve
competed in 13
tournaments and earned 8
championship
and finalists medals. More importantly, every one of our players has
improved drastically in their soccer skills. Our players are demonstrating a true
understanding of the game and impressive ball-handling skills. The few players with physical challenges are showing great improvement in
their running skills and body movements and our shy players are
showing initiative and drive. All are demonstrating commitment and
love for the sport.

Moving forward, our
immediate priorities are to:



	Sponsor young, talented
	players from low-income families who otherwise could not afford the
	high fees for local clubs



	Subsidize training for up
	to 140 IPSA Cadets – our new
	program designed to introduce novice U6 – U9 players to the sport
	and begin developing their skills and technique in a fun environment



	Fund our high school
	players’ college preparatory courses and college visitation trips,
	and gather game footage for their college recruiting 
	


Longer-term,
we are working to grow the Academy strategically. We are not aiming
for explosive expansion; we are seeking qualitative growth with a
manageable number of students who we can fully support with
personalized training from highly experienced staff. This means
establishing processes for, and funding, effective screening, hiring,
educating, and licensing of coaches.
We
know and understand that soccer is a growing sport in our country. We
also know that our Academy concept is still very new to the United
States but a proven method in Europe. We are constantly working to
educate the community on how other countries consistently produce
higher skilled players, demonstrating that the IPSA model of training
is the way forward. We are prepared to move slowly but effectively,
producing high quality players. 

We’ve
grown our Academy by word of mouth, visiting local schools, hosting
soccer camps, and inviting prospective students to try out our school
free of charge. Eventually, it is those young players who have made a
conscious decision to play soccer at an elite level who will find a
home at IPSA. IPSA’s holistic training perspective and commitment
to player development will make the difference.

How you can help:

We need to raise $30,000
before August 2015. This will help us:



	Provide scholarships
	for 10 full-time or 20 part-time players from low-income
	families for the 2015-2016 school year



	Purchase age-appropriate
	equipment, rent fields and classrooms from the city, and pay coach
	salaries for the IPSA Cadets program, reducing costs to families 
	



	Subsidize college
	application costs for our high school players.



Your contribution will
greatly advance IPSA’s mission and be a significant benefit to our
current and future students. As an IPSA sponsor, your name will
appear on our Academy website and the highest donor will have their
name or the name of their business/organization printed on the IPSA
Cadets’ game jerseys.

Other Ways You Can Help

We need monetary support
to advance our mission but we also need to get the word out about
IPSA and about our campaign. Please consider:

Their response to the crisis is the birth of Project Haven, an organization that strives to fill in the void of the lack of after school programs in New York City public schools. Contributions will help us fund programs like martial arts, and Cultural Excursions to keep the children engaged and safe away from the streets during the dangerous hours of 3pm to 5pm when hard working parents are not home and children fall prey to gangs, drugs and violence.
Our vast charter encompasses enrichment programs like chess, health, art, technology, sports, and travel for children k-12.
   
What We Need 
In collaboration with the City University of New York we will be expanding our reach to provide enriched programs that are deeply needed in our community.
This is our break down. 
PROJECT HAVEN MARTIAL ARTS PROGRAM - $41,325
Fifty-five students will get active while learning to find focus and stillness as they experience the discipline and confidence of martial arts. We provide everything they need including uniforms, sparring gear, mouth guards, and all the belts they can earn!
PROJECT HAVEN MULTICULTURAL EXCURSION - $23,810
Fifteen students will challenge their perspectives with six days of travel and discovery on a cultural excursion. 
PROJECT HAVEN CAMPING PROGRAM - $4,496
Thirteen students will replace the streetlights with stars and embark upon a teamwork adventure for seven days.

The Impact

  We at Project Haven believe that we can provide the much-needed opportunities for NYC children of today to become leaders of tomorrow. 
Young people who participate in outdoor adventures
benefit in countless ways as they step into new environments. Experiences with Project Haven will provide youth with the opportunity to develop:
Leadership and life skills
Self-confidence, self discipline and self-respect
Trust
A sense of responsibility for self, others, the
community, and the environment
Critical thinking skills
Teamwork experience
Decision-making skills                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Respect for all

<b>*Siad Barre:</b> General Mohammed Siad Barre was the military dictator and President of the Somali Democratic Republic from 1969-1991.<br/><br/>During the effort to institute socialist government in Somalia following a coup d'état in 1969, part of the Barre-led military junta's reign was characterized by oppressive dictatorial rule, including allegations of arbitrary arrests and summary killings of resistant Somalis in urban and rural nomad populations and the oppression and torture of political opponents and dissidents. The United Nations Development Programme has stated that ""the 21-year regime of Siyad Barre had one of the worst human rights records in Africa."" <br/><br/>
<p>In the mid-1980s, in response to resistance movements, especially the Somali National Movement (SNM) in northern Somaliland, Barre ordered punitive measures including mass executions and the bombing of cities, including administrative centers of Hargeisa among the targeted areas in 1988. The bombardment resulted in the deaths of an estimated 50,000 people.</p>
<p>To date, a small number of former members of the Siad Barre 
regime now residing in the United States have been successfully sued in U.S. federal court, including: the first human rights case to address atrocities under the Siad Barre regime, against former Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Mohamed Ali 
Samantar (Yousuf v. Samantar); Warfaa v. Ali, against notorious war criminal Colonel Yusuf Abdi Ali (aka Tukeh); and
 most recently, Ahmed v. Magan, against former Chief of Investigations of the infamous National Security

<p><b>WHAT IS FREE CHILDREN?  </b></p>
<p>      Free Children is a non-profit organisation created
to tackle poverty by helping children from underprivileged families to become
qualified professionals. This long term project, is aiming to provide education
to those who got less fortune and help them work towards a better life by
getting a full degree in programming, design and photography.</p>
<p><br/></p><p><b><span>What UNPics does?</span></b></p>
<p>Our school is aiming to offer free qualification in computer science,
programming (IOS, Android, Web, Ruby, PHP, Java, Scala, JS, CSS, C++, C#),
design, illustration and photography. The project will provide graduates an opportunity
to become experienced professionals in desired filed through learning and practicing
at the same time.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1290027/files/20150312104026-computer.jpg?1426182026"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Following the concept and main aim of the project, the project is
designed to help children from underprivileged families age 13-16 to get degree
in design or IT. </p>
<p>The reason for having this focus group is manly related to the time when
adolescents are completing mandatory studies funded by the state. As the
educational system in Moldova is based on universal knowledge, many of them
cannot apply their skills into practice, therefore failing in having a decent
job after their graduation. Moreover, all of them do not have the budget to continue
their studies in order to become a qualified professional with college or
university degree. </p>
<p>Therefore, Free Children will bring possibility for children to get a safe
profession witch which they can always compete on labour market.  </p>
<p><b>Why is not a simple charity
foundation?</b></p>
<p>The things we are doing is not charity, we are teaching, training and
employing unprivileged teenagers who are interested in arts and IT science.
 If they had a bad luck to be born in an unstable family or in a very poor
area it doesn’t mean that they cannot change their destiny. Or main goals and
objective is to give them the knowledge, practice, and a clear understanding of
how using their learned skills can get them a better life. </p>
<p><b>How it works?</b></p>
<p>When joining the course, students will be able to choose their field of
studies in computer science and programming or design, digital arts classes and
photography. The course will take a year and a half where children will learn
the basics of their area of interest and will apply their knowledge into real
time work experience by assisting experienced professionals who will rent our
studios on off-classes time.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1290197/files/20150312111405-t0_pv5vtq7Y.jpg?1426184045"" src="""" style=""width: 533.5888501742161px; height: 247px;""/></p><p><br/></p>
<p>Another pivotal mission of the project is helping students selling their
works on stock platforms. As a part of the agreement signed with their
representatives when joining the course, all the students will have their own
bank accounts linked to their online stock profiles from where they will earn
100% of the sales of works such as: digital content, hand painted posters,
postcards, and interior design sketches. From the gained income they will be
allowed to spend only half of it, the rest being saved for their future higher
education studies. For all the others users selling their works from our stock
platform they will earn 70% of the sales of works such as: digital content,
hand painted posters, postcards, and interior design sketches the rest of 30%
will be used to expand the project nationally by building two more schools in other
main cities or financing project which intend to support the same cause. If the
project will be successful, after 3-4 years Free Children is planning to open
an international chain in other vulnerable countries, with first location to be
Varanssy, India. </p>
<p>100% of our students will get a job, </p>
<p>Another key focus of the intended project is to help students finding
jobs in the fields they graduated from. They can start in the school studio and
teach other generations or we will source potential employers who are looking
for graduates. In addition to that, will source pre-job contracts, where the
students will be qualified based on employer’s requests, those securing a
position after they completed their degree.  Also there are 2 more options  becoming a part of our big family   they
can pass a training an become a teacher in our  next
studio. At the end all of them  are going
to get  a free account on Freelance.pro,
a new start up from our friends.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1290195/files/20150312111259-4sFpjUXdv_U.jpg?1426183979"" src="""" style=""width: 378.0487804878049px; height: 175px;""/></p><p></p><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p><p>Our goal this year</p><ul>

WHAT IS FREE CHILDREN?  
      Free Children is a non-profit organisation created
to tackle poverty by helping children from underprivileged families to become
qualified professionals. This long term project, is aiming to provide education
to those who got less fortune and help them work towards a better life by
getting a full degree in programming, design and photography.
What UNPics does?
Our school is aiming to offer free qualification in computer science,
programming (IOS, Android, Web, Ruby, PHP, Java, Scala, JS, CSS, C++, C#),
design, illustration and photography. The project will provide graduates an opportunity
to become experienced professionals in desired filed through learning and practicing
at the same time.
Following the concept and main aim of the project, the project is
designed to help children from underprivileged families age 13-16 to get degree
in design or IT. 
The reason for having this focus group is manly related to the time when
adolescents are completing mandatory studies funded by the state. As the
educational system in Moldova is based on universal knowledge, many of them
cannot apply their skills into practice, therefore failing in having a decent
job after their graduation. Moreover, all of them do not have the budget to continue
their studies in order to become a qualified professional with college or
university degree. 
Therefore, Free Children will bring possibility for children to get a safe
profession witch which they can always compete on labour market.  
Why is not a simple charity
foundation?
The things we are doing is not charity, we are teaching, training and
employing unprivileged teenagers who are interested in arts and IT science.
 If they had a bad luck to be born in an unstable family or in a very poor
area it doesn’t mean that they cannot change their destiny. Or main goals and
objective is to give them the knowledge, practice, and a clear understanding of
how using their learned skills can get them a better life. 
How it works?
When joining the course, students will be able to choose their field of
studies in computer science and programming or design, digital arts classes and
photography. The course will take a year and a half where children will learn
the basics of their area of interest and will apply their knowledge into real
time work experience by assisting experienced professionals who will rent our
studios on off-classes time.
Another pivotal mission of the project is helping students selling their
works on stock platforms. As a part of the agreement signed with their
representatives when joining the course, all the students will have their own
bank accounts linked to their online stock profiles from where they will earn
100% of the sales of works such as: digital content, hand painted posters,
postcards, and interior design sketches. From the gained income they will be
allowed to spend only half of it, the rest being saved for their future higher
education studies. For all the others users selling their works from our stock
platform they will earn 70% of the sales of works such as: digital content,
hand painted posters, postcards, and interior design sketches the rest of 30%
will be used to expand the project nationally by building two more schools in other
main cities or financing project which intend to support the same cause. If the
project will be successful, after 3-4 years Free Children is planning to open
an international chain in other vulnerable countries, with first location to be
Varanssy, India. 
100% of our students will get a job, 
Another key focus of the intended project is to help students finding
jobs in the fields they graduated from. They can start in the school studio and
teach other generations or we will source potential employers who are looking
for graduates. In addition to that, will source pre-job contracts, where the
students will be qualified based on employer’s requests, those securing a
position after they completed their degree.  Also there are 2 more options  becoming a part of our big family   they
can pass a training an become a teacher in our  next
studio. At the end all of them  are going
to get  a free account on Freelance.pro,
a new start up from our friends.What We Need & What You GetOur goal this year

In so doing, US Represented acts as a conduit for the creative power in every community we reach. All too often, people get trapped in mental silos. US Represented offers a more perceptive, urbane vision of our increasingly complex world. We publish political, historical, and scientific essays, travel and nature articles, and memoirs. Our writers also share smart, stylish short stories, serialized novels, and poetry. We address environmental and sustainability issues as well. Of equal importance, US Represented features an art gallery and a music section. Our plan is to expand and improve the site in order to broaden our readership and give more artists a venue for their work. 
What We Need & What You Get
US Represented needs $75,000 to pay for operating costs, new staff positions, web design upgrades, and the creation of mirror sites throughout the country that will link to the main site. With your help, we will transcend our current financial limitations in order to serve you better. US Represented's readership already spans the world, and 
we’re always seeking new talent and challenging those who work with us 
to nurture their creativity. Our vision is to transform ourselves and the communities in which we live by participating in them. Join us as friends of the site to help make our vision a reality.

The Impact
With its dedication to diverse viewpoints, US Represented serves an ever-expanding audience that appreciates literature, art, and music
in a variety of genres. The site features award-winning writers and artists, and we add new content every day. As a result of this campaign and future fundraising activities, US Represented will be able to pay writers and artists for their efforts. Doing so will validate the work we publish and increase its value.
In just two years, our readership has grown to well over 30,000 people, 22,000
of whom are registered on our site. We also have over 7,700 Facebook
followers and over 3,000 Twitter followers, but we want to extend our reach even further. We want to share our work with everyone who can access our site.
Challenges
We are quickly outgrowing our chosen platform. Many of our guests access our content on a phone or tablet, so we need to explore
new applications in order to meet the needs of our audience. Until now, the
site has been funded solely through donations from
our staff, and costs continue to increase. Your financial support of US
Represented will allow us to grow naturally instead of being
constrained by our limited budget.
Other Ways You Can Help
Every donation matters because you matter. The money you invest will allow us to give you a more polished and well-rounded production. We offer great perks for larger contributions, but even donations of $1, $2, or $5 will help considerably. Your support of our campaign will show that you believe in us and want to play a role in our evolution. You can also help by telling others about US Represented.
