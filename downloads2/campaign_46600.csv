</div></div>","Our Story
It wasn't until mid-college where I realized how much waste is consumed in the development of clothing, how resources that are currently available were not taken advantage of, and how different fabrications can negatively impact the environment and our human health.

Stacy Longo Sustainable Apparel, is a line dedicated to create fashion that does not negatively impact the environment and human health. Please support to save the earth! I'm excited to get the chance from this point forward, to develop zero-waste pattern making, working with new eco fabrics and local factories.  I hope each one of you who read this, can support and contribute - even the smallest donation would be much appreciated!



The Impact
The line isn't about helping my dreams come true. It's endless possibilities as to what cutting back the waste can do for our earth. I really believe the domino effect, once you enlighten one person, they will enlighten another. 

Just a few quick points!:
Local production: Think of all the gas and energy that is used to transport your products! If your producing abroad, how often can you really go overseas? How do you know if your workers are being treated properly? This allows us to visit our local factory as often as needed, cut out the middle-man and be responsible for not only supporting local business but also the possibility of creating more work for our country.

Zero Waste Patternmaking: This is a concept used where in the patternmaking process the main goal is to completely eliminate ANY waste. All fabric that is laid out and ready to be cut, will be consumed by your patterns. (The above image I created, represents that!)


What We Need & What You Get
It's important that everything gets done correctly - if the funds raised does not meet the goal amount then certain of the below points will be on the back burner for now. Please help me get all the below accomplished!


Sustainable fabrics such as soy, tencel, hemp, bamboo & more.
Examining Zero-Waste pattern making
Local production
Fabric Sourcing & Research
Add-ons to Website Development to make it User-Friendly for you!
Proper Trademarking
Create a resourceful fabric/trim library
Photographing the Line - hopefully work with emerging Photographers!
Participating in Local Fairs
Future development of other sustainable products



Pick out something nice for you, a friend, a family member or all 3 to the right of this campaign page!  I have worked for months and months to network with amazing emerging artists who were so generous to donate their products! Each artist has great items that they want to present to YOU, and that is what this is about - Supporting Emerging Artists!


Other Ways You Can Help
Please help spread the world with the help of social media - Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr & more! You don't need Facebook or Twitter to donate, so please also spread the word by email and word of mouth as well!

<p>Who says only moms and big toy companies can create successful, meaningful kid products? </p>
<p>Sass Factory is an “auntie” created clothing line &amp; web experience for young girls, inspired by the age-old paper doll pastime. I like to call it a <strong><em>“play on fashion”</em></strong>. <em>Get it?? :-)</em><em><br/></em></p>
<p>Sass Factory Me-Ts allow kids to develop their own fashion sense, by providing t-shirts that are customizable and totally unique.  Using Velcro appliqués, kids get to make creative choices and express their own sense of style, all while wearing wholesome, age-appropriate clothing (which moms love!).</p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Sass Factory"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.sassfactory.com/images/uploads/5667431343613090Me-T2.jpg"" src="""" title=""Sass Factory""/> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>…BACK HOME, THAT IS!</strong></h2>
<p>Behind the fun, sassy exterior, there’s a more earnest purpose. Sass Factory wants to improve lives by supporting ecosystems that create gainful employment in our communities. That’s why we’ve taken three important, exciting steps: </p>
<p>1) We’re bringing manufacturing home to the US! Previously made in Asia, now, <strong>Sass Factory Me-Ts are being made in America</strong>.  We’re excited to help support the creation of jobs in America, especially given the struggles Individuals and families in the US have experienced during the tough economy. In fact, if we spent just 1% more on American made products, 200,000 new jobs would be created!<strong> </strong></p>
<p>2) We’re purposefully working with a manufacturing partner that <strong>creates jobs for single moms</strong>. Nearly 40% of single moms in the US are below the poverty line, an appalling statistic.  Our manufacturing partner, American MoJo, provides higher wages, funded child care, healthcare, retirement plans, education, and career training to single moms.</p>
<p>3) We’re also fortunate to have found a packaging partner that<strong> creates jobs for people with disabiliti</strong><strong>es</strong>.  1 in 5 Americans have a disability—yet they are 4 times more likely to be unemployed than the general population.  Our packaging partner, PRIDE Industries, provides support, training and opportunities to help people with disabilities overcome obstacles and benefit from meaningful employment. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>HOW YOU CAN HELP</strong></h2>
<p>Your contribution will fund the following activities:  </p>
<p>1. US <strong>manufacturing</strong> and packaging of our fall/winter Me-T line, which includes extending our line to size 3/4 and to long-sleeve Me-Ts to meet customer demand.</p>
<p>2. Expanding <strong>distribution</strong> into retail so that we can reach our customers in person. <br/> <br/> Ultimately, supporting this project will <strong>help Sass Factory grow and continue to support our partners in creating gainful employment in communities in the US.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>HOW IT ALL BEGAN</strong></h2>
<p>The most frequent question I get is about how I came up with the Sass Factory concept. It’s really quite simple:  I was trying to put a smile on my niece’s face on a rainy day. Long story short, I made her a t-shirt which featured characters she could “dress up,” and she was absolutely thrilled, When her friends saw her wearing her unique t-shirt, I soon developed a small demand for these t-shirts.  And things just grew from there. But, most importantly, the t-shirt itself ended up putting a smile on my fashio”<strong><em>niece</em></strong>”ta’s face.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>MY DREAM</strong></h2>
<p>On a more personal note, let me start by telling you that a lot of blood, sweat and tears have gone into creating Sass Factory. I’ve had great days and I’ve had lousy days as a result of this sassy creation that I love so much. But what makes it worth it is not only the passion I have for the products and witnessing the delight when customers discover and/or receive them, but also the vision I have and hold onto for the future of Sass Factory. </p>
<p>As you’ve probably gathered by now, I’m passionate about creating opportunities for gainful employment, regardless of an individual’s circumstances. My dream for Sass Factory is to one day make it the happiest place in the world to work. I would love to see Sass Factory grow into a place with flexible work opportunities that fit the lifestyles of its employees, a fun and creative work environment with a multitude of options.</p>
<p>I want the company to be results-driven, while allowing each employee to decide the right level of autonomy or direction for them. I want a workplace full of encouragement and support, where performance success is measured by your passion and accomplishments, not by how many hours you clock.   </p>
<p>However, as a realist, I know achieving this dream requires time, effort, persistence and money. I hope you see it as a dream worth backing and one day, perhaps even living.</p>

However, as a realist, I know achieving this dream requires time, effort, persistence and money. I hope you see it as a dream worth backing and one day, perhaps even living.
 
SPREAD THE WORD 
Here’s how you can help spread the word about our Indiegogo campaign:
1) Share our link with your Facebook friends: You can do this by directly posting the following link and image or sharing our Indiegogo posts directly from the Sass Factory Facebook fan page: 
Sass Factory paper doll inspired shirts for girls are not only fun, but also socially conscious! Help back their Indiegogo project for discounted pricing and advance purchasing for their Fall/Winter line! http://bit.ly/PZ6w4X 
Use this image on your Facebook post!

2) Tweet about us: Make up your own tweet or use one of ours!   
• Sample Tweet 1: I just backed @SassFactoryFans on @Indiegogo http://bit.ly/PZ6w4X 
• Sample Tweet 2: @SassFactoryFans Back that Sass Up! I know I did on @Indiegogo http://bit.ly/PZ6w4X 
3) Tell your friends: Pick a few of your closest friends and family members who would support this cause and send them a personal email about our product and the missions we support, and requesting their support. Ask them to tell a few of *their* friends to do the same thing. In my experience, good people know good people and word of mouth is extremely powerful!
4) Post one of these sassy badges on your blog or web site and link them back to this page http://bit.ly/PZ6w4X

<h3>To the fans of Anime, Comics &amp; Fighting Games, to the fans of this campaign, both the believers and the skeptical ones, if there is a particular design that you definitely want to see get printed but aren't too confident that this will happen, there is a solution. All it takes is for you &amp; (10) of your friends (who all like the same design) to make a $30 contribution. Doing so pretty much guarantees that you &amp; your friends will all get the design you hoped for. I want everyone to know that getting the T-shirts printed is my no. 1 priority, all else comes after. So whether I reach my goal or not there is still a way for some/all to get the design of their choice. <br/>For any questions regarding the above please feel free to contact me at: melbielgma@gmail.com<br/>Thanks &amp; God Bless<br/>Mel Biel/FWB Apparel</h3>

<h3><strong>Mel Biel/ FWB Apparel (Fighters with Belief):</strong></h3>
<p>Hello and welcome all to my campaign. My name is Mel and I'm hoping to one day launch my very own T-shirt line called FWB Apparel. The best way for me to sum up FWB Apparel is by saying that it's art/illustration with a voice, your voice. Through this ""voice"" you get the chance to express what you fight for and believe in, alongside a cool ""kick-ass"" character design. These designs are inspired by Comic Book Super Heroes, Anime and Capcom's Street Fighter games.</p>
<p>Now when it comes to T-shirts and T-shirt printing, I definitely like screen printing just as much as anyone else but I'm also a big fan of heat pressing which is what lead to this campaign. I already own a heat press and so the next step (besides a printer) is to purchase a 24'' Vinyl cutter. With this machine I can cut a variety of designs and patterns that wouldn't otherwise be possible, so in other words it's a must have. That's where you and your donations come in.</p>

<h3>Thoughts...</h3>
<p>All of life's events are seldom (if at all) random. When you choose one of these Tees, whether it be because of the character design or the expression, I believe that there is a more personal reason behind it. I believe that there is a certain something within that becomes ""magnetically"" attracted to what it sees as a common, familiar, essential and relatable part of itself, a connection of some kind.</p>
<p>At the moment none of my characters have a back-story (their ""Bios"" are empty) which isn't a bad thing since there's plenty of people to ""fill that void"". In other words your beliefs, your experiences, your good times, bad times, your pasts, presents, and futures have now become these character's unique back-stories. Congratulations on becoming/being official back-story writers for FWB Apparel, as all that is required is to enjoy the GOD given privilege to be unfeigned and diligent writers of your fate.</p>

The Line &amp; The Ladies</b></p>
<p>Greetings all of you STRAPPING beauties and gents!  (Get it,
strapping??  Shoes??  And the tone is set…).  We are Heather and Lindsay, creators of the
Pippa France shoe brand!  We're just a couple of Interior Designers who
happened to fall in love with textiles and prints and are now setting out to
initiate our dream of becoming Shoe Designers! 
A bit more about our creations: Our line is American hand-made (yay!
Economy!) and the FIRST ladies lux shoe collection (that we know of!) to be
based solely off prints.  We’ve done a
lot of work over the last couple years - from trademarks to shoe making courses,
to sale samples, and more!  We are continuously
expanding our knowledge of our product, and we are anxious to get these babies
on ladies’ feet EVERYWHERE!  For now, we
start small with a planned Spring collection of eight styles we hope to launch
in 2015. Nothing great was ever achieved alone, however, and our dream is no
different!  Here is where YOU Pippettes
come in!  Thank you ALL in advance for
your continued support and enthusiasm for our line!  We seriously cannot make this happen without
that piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp;
What You Get</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our shoes are made-upon-order, but we still need stock materials<b>! </b> This includes a run of custom lasts for our
Megan style, extra fabrics, leather hides, and any buckles or hardware.  We are also planning to foster sales through
an ecommerce website (already have the domain!) but we aren’t so
technically-savvy!  We have our goals for
our initial collection in mind, but we know Rome was not built in a day!  We are excited to see what doors may open up
with this endeavor, and we will re-evaluate the business plan as needed to
reflect what we are fortunate to raise. The important thing is we’ve gotten out
there.  More details below!</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Fabric = $1,100</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Leather = $1,000</p>

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We firmly believe in a world where people can wake up every morning and
do what they love, a world where the monotonous soul-less cliché of the 9 to 5
is something foreign.  Quality shoes is
our love, and we’d never be able to build on our foundation without the help of
contributors like you.  We hope to one
day be able to pay it forward so others may reach their true potential and
chase their dreams.  In the meantime, we
hope to bring a splash of personality (and maybe a few smiles along the way) to
ladies feet all over America,
one step at a time! (Pun intended!)  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can
Help</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Hey, if we had money, we wouldn’t be asking for any! (‘2 Broke Girls’
ain’t got nothin’ on us!).  So we
completely understand not everyone is able to contribute.  Fortunately, there are other (and maybe even
more powerful) ways you can help a couple gals out!  Simply spread the word to anyone you think
would be excited to hear about our print-full little shoe line and remember,
Indiegogo has some easy-to-use share tools, too!</p>
<p>We cannot put into words how much this process has meant to us over the last
few years.  Yes, there were highs AND
lows, but nothing has touched us more than the immense support we have received
and the strength it has fed us to push forward. 
It starts with an idea mixed with some passion and patience, but it’s

<p>Help fund Randy Rose's hip replacement</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Wrestling historians and fans alike, can remember turning on their television in the 80's and watching wrestlers fighting for Championship Gold and each other!  One of the great memories of that time,  was the strong emergence of the Tag-Team division.  One of the leading teams of that era was The Original Midnight Express, consisting of Randy Rose , Dennis Condrey and Norvell Austin, soon became the NWA Tag Team champions and later down the road,  AWA World Tag Team champions. One of their most notable feuds would pit the The ""Original"" Midnight Express, managed by a fresh faced Paul E. Dangerously, against a ""newly"" formed Midnight Express managed by Jim Cornett. Towards the end of the 80's the feud came to an end and Randy went on to Georgia All-Star Wrestling and the Global Wrestling Federation where he would later retire.  After his retirement Randy went on to help local charities, most notably the Mucscular Dystrophy Association(MDA). </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Due to the rough and tumble lifestyle led by these athletes, over time, their bodies suffer the effects of wrestling. That being said, Randy Rose's hip has deteriorated to the point of needing a full hip replacement surgery.  Randy will be having this surgery at the end of October 2013.  Being that insurance for wrestlers is limited, if non existent, this Indiegogo account has been created.  We would like to ask you, the fans, to please give back if you can to a man who gave a majority of his career to you.  We are asking for $8500 to help Randy have this surgery, mend and ultimately be pain free. If for any reason we cannot reach this goal totally for Randy, the money raised will still assist him going towards the surgery. This account, along with a P.O. Box (P.O. Box 222, Acworth, Ga. 30101) has been set up where you can make your donation in the form of PayPal, cash, check or money order payable to R&amp;R Lifts c/o Randy.  Please look and see below what Randy Rose will give you in return for your donation(s).  Thank you for your time reading this and your donation, it is GREATLY appreciated!</p></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Help fund Randy Rose's hip replacement

That being said, Randy Rose's hip has deteriorated to the point of needing a full hip replacement surgery.  Randy will be having this surgery at the end of October 2013.  Being that insurance for wrestlers is limited, if non existent, this Indiegogo account has been created.  We would like to ask you, the fans, to please give back if you can to a man who gave a majority of his career to you.  We are asking for $8500 to help Randy have this surgery, mend and ultimately be pain free. If for any reason we cannot reach this goal totally for Randy, the money raised will still assist him going towards the surgery. This account, along with a P.O. Box (P.O. Box 222, Acworth, Ga. 30101) has been set up where you can make your donation in the form of PayPal, cash, check or money order payable to R&R Lifts c/o Randy.  Please look and see below what Randy Rose will give you in return for your donation(s).  Thank you for your time reading this and your donation, it is GREATLY appreciated!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>WHAT HAPPENED  </h3>
<p>Hiya, i'm Charlotte, a self-employed jewellery designer and businesswoman. In December I moved from Bristol back to my parents in Hemel. Since then I have poured the bulk of my savings into building a brand new workshop to carry on my now 5 year strong business <a href=""http://www.blackheartcreatives.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Black Heart Creatives.</a> This included building a cabin, installing electrics, furniture, a workbench, and flooring. My laser was still in Bristol whilst this was going on and my lovely friends at Yeah Laser have been cutting my orders for me; however this is not cost efficient for my largely custom business, and has been eating away at my profits.  Last month my trusty laser was shipped to me, but it turns out it did not survive the move.</p>
<p>My laser is a decade old, so fixing it is not simple or a long term solution. I've had an estimate that even short term repairs would cost around £1000, maybe even more. I've already spent a lot of money repairing this laser and it is not good business sense to continue throwing money at it. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>THE LASER </h3>
<p>I need £3500 in order to buy <a href=""http://hpclaser.co.uk/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=1&amp;products_id=128"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my new lovely laser from the amazing people at HPC</a>, get it shipped and installed in my workshop. </p>
<p>I am asking for the full amount as I need to use what's left of my savings to keep outsourcing my customers orders until the new laser arrives (which is approximately £70-100 a week) and pay for things like materials, postage and photographer for the new collection, in order for the business to keep ticking over. </p>

<h3>HOW YOUR BACKING WILL HELP </h3>
<p>Currently I am totally without a laser, so I can start earning money again! But it will also mean I can expand what I am currently doing. From starting as a totally self taught etsy business making some money making name necklaces, to <a href=""http://www.blackheartcreatives.com/press"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">featuring in Vogue</a>, I can safely say that Black Heart Creatives is a successful business, and I have been running it full time since 2014.  Moving to self employment was a scary but important move for me personally as I became unable to work a traditional job as I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, and hemiplegic migraines (the list goes on and on I won't bore you). This means I am 'unreliable' to normal employers, and being able to set my own hours, and days and limits means I can keep working. </p>
<p>My recent change in personal circumstances mean I am now on a single income, and as challenging as that is, I know Black Heart Creatives is sustainable if I can cut my own pieces. My business plans for this year have already been hindered by the lack of my own laser. A newer faster better laser will enable me to do higher quality, more advanced technical pieces, and would mean that I could meet the requirements of the retailers and museums who have expressed interest in stocking my pieces . I would hate to throw away all the hard work I have put in to the business. Your help would mean that not only would this small business continue, but it would grow too. </p>

<h3>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP </h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, then that is ok! What you could do for me, is share the campaign.

<p><strong>Thank you</strong> for taking a look at our Indiegogo Project. <b>Mestre MMA Gear </b>is a brand new line of apparel for MMA, BJJ, martial artists and enthusiasts! Our unique team of highly trained martial artists also happen to be experienced graphic artists as well. The word 'Mestre' is the Portuguese word for 'Master' and simply represents the drive in all of us not to necessarily become masters one day, but to push ourselves to be the best we can be in all areas of life.</p>
<p>We have infused the classic warrior spirit with <b>Mestre MMA Gear</b> artwork that is a cross between anime and grunge, between quality training gear and amazing artwork. </p>
<p>Our current designs have already been purchased by fans from around the world, even some that just loved the designs but participate in other sports or none at all. </p>
<p>We have been fulfilling orders through a middle company or companies for a few years, but  we will be flying to meet with several factories in Taiwan and Korea. Our designs are unique enough, and fan base large enough that they warrant dealing directly with a manufacturer who can do all of the work from start to finish in one location, and who will be able to produce the quality and quantity of orders we need in a shorter period of time. </p>
<p><strong>Why Do We Need Funding!?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Problem #1</strong>  - We fulfill orders through printing companies that highly restrict our ability to expand our market base due to overhead cost.</p>
<p><strong>Solution #1</strong> - We will be meeting with factories in Taiwan and Korea, three hours from our location in Okinawa, Japan, which can produce clothing, gi uniforms, gloves, hats and much more with high quality and quick turnaround.</p>
<p><strong>Problem #2 -</strong> Quick mass production of designs is difficult. Our printing company has about a 4-6 week turnaround no matter the size of the order. Not only do have to pay a bit more for clothing, but we also have to pay for shipping from California to Okinawa, and pay customs taxes to the Government of Japan as well. So, although we make a profit, it is tough to grow exponentially and expand the clothing line.</p>
<p><strong>Solution #2 -</strong> Once production commences in Taiwan or Korea we will be able to produce a large amount of apparel with a turnaround of 10-14 days including shipping to Okinawa. Initially we want to enter the large scale global market with five of our designs. The five designs will create a positive flow to fund future projects.</p>
<p><strong>Problem #3</strong> - As a new clothing company we still have to make a name for ourselves. We have a small, loyal customer base, but need to expand.</p>
<p><strong>Solution #3</strong> - Fund the marketing campaign, prizes, giveaways perks through FB, GooglePlus, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram and Youtube as well as Sponsor a few fighters and teams around the world. </p>
<p>We appreciate all of our fans and partners that have been working alongside of us, supporting us, and representing Mestre MMA Gear. We look forward to working with you and supporting you and your martial arts journey into the future with more designs for not just rasguards, but gi uniforms, sparring gear, fight shorts and more. First, we will start where we are, use what we have and do all we can before offering those items in 2014.</p>

<p><b>WHO ARE WE:</b></p>
<p>We are both former military members who have now made a life in Japan, one as a professional martial artist instructor and fighter, musician, artist, performer and entrepreneur, and the other as an artist, designer and entrepreneur. Due to our military backgrounds, education and business experiences we are well able to run the clothing line financially, strategically, artistically and logistically.*9*-</p></span>
</span></span></span></span></div>","Thank you for taking a look at our Indiegogo Project. Mestre MMA Gear is a brand new line of apparel for MMA, BJJ, martial artists and enthusiasts! Our unique team of highly trained martial artists also happen to be experienced graphic artists as well. The word 'Mestre' is the Portuguese word for 'Master' and simply represents the drive in all of us not to necessarily become masters one day, but to push ourselves to be the best we can be in all areas of life.
We have infused the classic warrior spirit with Mestre MMA Gear artwork that is a cross between anime and grunge, between quality training gear and amazing artwork. 
Our current designs have already been purchased by fans from around the world, even some that just loved the designs but participate in other sports or none at all. 
We have been fulfilling orders through a middle company or companies for a few years, but  we will be flying to meet with several factories in Taiwan and Korea. Our designs are unique enough, and fan base large enough that they warrant dealing directly with a manufacturer who can do all of the work from start to finish in one location, and who will be able to produce the quality and quantity of orders we need in a shorter period of time. 
Why Do We Need Funding!?
Problem #1  - We fulfill orders through printing companies that highly restrict our ability to expand our market base due to overhead cost.
Solution #1 - We will be meeting with factories in Taiwan and Korea, three hours from our location in Okinawa, Japan, which can produce clothing, gi uniforms, gloves, hats and much more with high quality and quick turnaround.
Problem #2 - Quick mass production of designs is difficult. Our printing company has about a 4-6 week turnaround no matter the size of the order. Not only do have to pay a bit more for clothing, but we also have to pay for shipping from California to Okinawa, and pay customs taxes to the Government of Japan as well. So, although we make a profit, it is tough to grow exponentially and expand the clothing line.
Solution #2 - Once production commences in Taiwan or Korea we will be able to produce a large amount of apparel with a turnaround of 10-14 days including shipping to Okinawa. Initially we want to enter the large scale global market with five of our designs. The five designs will create a positive flow to fund future projects.
Problem #3 - As a new clothing company we still have to make a name for ourselves. We have a small, loyal customer base, but need to expand.
Solution #3 - Fund the marketing campaign, prizes, giveaways perks through FB, GooglePlus, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram and Youtube as well as Sponsor a few fighters and teams around the world. 
We appreciate all of our fans and partners that have been working alongside of us, supporting us, and representing Mestre MMA Gear. We look forward to working with you and supporting you and your martial arts journey into the future with more designs for not just rasguards, but gi uniforms, sparring gear, fight shorts and more. First, we will start where we are, use what we have and do all we can before offering those items in 2014.
DESIGNS and PERKS:
HONORABLE MENTION for a $5.00 or More Contribution: We will be putting your name on the back of our commemorative campaign tshirt as a super thank you for all of your help.

Hopefully you'd eventually like this design as much as I do and be part of this -to become- monstruously cute adventure. Details about the project:I need your help in funding the project in order to have an irreproachable quality for the printing process and in all the small details such as Packaging for instance.I would like to Print a limited edition of 200 Tshirts +Stickers+Postcards+Posters.For those who will be purchasing the Item, Let me know what size you are looking for and be aware that the lovely package will be sent from Hong Kong (which isn t an issue at all but it makes it exotic to point it out).Now, If you can't participate on the project with money, it's no biggie at all, that being said if you could take the time to spread the love on your social networks that would be lovely from you and I would defenetly give you a virtual french kiss with honourable intentions of ze course.Here's the Monstruously Cute Packages you can get.


Thank you again for your support I really appriciate it :)",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>The idea for my give-back backpack company materialized in 2010 when I hopped on a plane to spend four-and-a-half months traveling and volunteering with kids in developing countries.</p>
<p>After a two-decade career designing products for luxury beauty brands (including Ralph Lauren Fragrances, Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, and Sephora), I wanted to do something more impactful with my life.</p>
<p>That something came after spending time in schools and orphanages in some of the world’s poorest countries – Tanzania, India, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos.</p>
<p>At an orphanage in India, I handed out pencils to a classroom of excited students. Their immense gratitude for something so simple blew my mind. Throughout the course of my journey, I realized that the children I met are like millions of others around the world. They are eager for an education but lack basic supplies. I returned to San Francisco determined to help so I switched career paths and put my background in product development to use.</p>

<h3>Unique Horizontal Design</h3>
<p>Recent studies have shown that 64% of kids suffer from back pain, in most cases due to overloaded or ill-fitting backpacks. Our patent pending, ergonomic design keeps the weight of the backpack at waist level and allows for easy reach of books and supplies. Several compartments keep items well-organized and allow weight to be evenly distributed throughout. Our backpacks are lightweight at only 2 lbs (1 kilo), alleviating any extra load. Made with rugged 600-denier polyester, they are water-resistant and built to last.</p>
<p>Kids come in all different sizes, so we believe that backpacks should too! That’s why we offer both large and medium sizes on all backpack styles. Flyer backpacks come in size small and are perfect for a preschooler or kindergartner.</p>

After you pledge you will be able to add on items like custom lace accents to <i>Alex</i>, additional pairs of panties, and tote bags. </p><p>****</p><p>Hello there! We’re Valid, a bunch of queer people making stuff for queering life. We’re best known for our jewelry, featuring flags of various queer and gender variant communities – from asexual to transgender. When one of our founders started questioning their gender, we started to notice that tucking options were... not great. They were either expensive and not really functional, frighteningly expensive and on backorder, or a nightmare of DIYing and guessing at sizes.</p><p>Post Secondary is here to fix that. We’ve spent over a year designing and testing an undergarment designed explicitly to comfortably conceal a phallus all day long, even in fairly extreme circumstances. We call them <i>Alex</i>. <i>Alex</i> doesn’t have any weird, chafing seams. <i>Alex</i> isn’t designed by a cis-guy with a fetish. <i>Alex</i> is made from breathable fabric, so you don’t overheat. Best of all, <i>Alex</i> is priced so that trans folks can actually afford to own them.</p><p>Right now, we have a fully functional <i>Alex</i> prototype. We've done extensive testing and we’re happy with how it fits and how it functions. We need your help to get <i>Alex</i> in the hands of the folks who need it, because we’ve run into a few problems.</p><p><strong><i>Problem 1:</i></strong> There is almost no market research on transfeminine or gender neutral folks out there. We know how many we need for our minimum order, but we don't know if that will be enough and what sizes are most wanted. By buying here, you'll help us get a better idea of what to produce for our first run.</p><p><strong><i>Problem B:</i></strong> The clothing industry works on an economy of scale. The more we initially order, the more affordable each pair becomes. Our goal is to make <i>Alex</i> as affordable as possible. We're using Indiegogo to spread the word about <i>Alex</i> even further, so that folks who otherwise never would have heard about <i>Alex</i> can get a pair of their very own.</p><p>Trans and gender nonconforming people have enough struggles. Finding underwear that they can wear all day and still be cute shouldn’t be one of them.</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Here’s the deal: to make these affordable, we need to order a bunch of them. We’re asking for $9,520 dollars. Of that amount, 78% covers the production of <i>Alex</i> and the other rewards, 10% covers our shipping of the rewards, and 12% covers Indiegogo’s fees, taxes, patent application, and other assorted fees.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500771203/ygtm4jpqhfaunt1agnnl.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We’ve opted to go with flexible funding for this project. We hope to exceed our goals, but even if we don’t, we’ve made sure that our budget ensures that everyone who orders <i>Alex</i> from us will get their underwear.</p><p>As we pass our initial goal we will be able to add more sizes (youth sizing!), order more pairs to lower the overall price, add lace and more colors, and begin the final design and sample production for the next piece in the Post Secondary line.</p><p>Easy enough, you say, but what’s in it for me?

We’ve done everything in our power to make <i>Alex</i> affordable and available. With your help, no one will have to resort to duct taping their phallus in place unless they want to. Plus, the better this campaign does, the more affordable these underwear will become.</p><p>Not only that, but we’re ready to start rebuilding other gender affirming undergarments. We have plans for panties that add hips (see below), affordable tucking panties with lace and fun patterns, and a ground up rebuild of the chest binder.</p><h3>Retailer Options</h3><p>Are you a store that serves transgender, nonbinary, and genderqueer people? Are you looking for tucking panties that aren't terrible or terribly expensive? We have some great packages built for retailers, so that you can outfit your store to outfit your customers. If you are interested in getting these details, please <a href=""mailto:proud@wearevalid.com?subject=Retail%20Inquiry"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact us</a>.</p><h3>Shipping Details</h3><p><u>All</u> clothing perks will be shipped by USPS Priority (Domestic &amp; International) so that all items include tracking numbers. We understand that this makes international shipping expensive, but without tracking we cannot guarantee you will receive your package. If you are an international backer concerned about shipping fees, we recommend teaming up with nearby friends to become a supporter so that you can split shipping costs.</p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>Because we've done so much of the groundwork before coming to you, there are surprisingly few challenges to overcome for <i>Alex</i>. We have a garment manufacturer that we trust to do the final manufacturing, and we know their work is good because they supplied us with our prototypes. We’re working with a Los Angeles designer and production manager (who specializes in undergarments) to ensure that everything goes smoothly.</p><p>Shipping is always a challenge, but this is not our first crowdfunding rodeo. We’ve run a very successful Kickstarter campaign with our sibling company, Optimystical Studios, and we’ve worked with a lot of other crowdfunding campaigns as perk suppliers. We’re prepared for all of the usual hiccups that come with shipping specifically and crowdfunding in general.</p><p>Even if we’re wildly successful, we’re still ordering garments in quantities that are tiny for the industry. That’s okay, because the garment manufacturer we’re working with is set up for both tiny to enormous orders. There is always the risk that they could go out of business before our campaign finishes (they have been in business for 27 years, so this seems unlikely), or that they become overwhelmed with other projects. It’s okay, our production manager has two alternate manufacturers lined up just in case.</p><p>In a worst case scenario, we’ll let you know that there will be a delay in shipping and keep everyone in the loop about what’s going on. As we have met our goal, everyone will be getting their perks, even if we hit a delay.</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>We get it, money is always tight. That’s okay. Let people know what we’re up to. Share the project on the social media platform of your choice, talk to your friends about it, contact your local Queer Straight Alliance and make sure they’ve heard about it!</p><p>Do you know buyers for stores that stock other gender affirming garments? Let them know that we would love to supply them with the best tucking panties on the market!</p><p>Word of mouth is great, and we appreciate you all talking about us.</p><h3>What Else Is In The Works?</h3><p>We've already started work on the 2nd piece of Gender Affirming Shapewear in our Post Secondary line, their name is <i>Morgan</i>. And <i>Morgan</i> is here to give you some curves.</p><p><i>Morgan</i> will be a longer leg version of the <i>Alex</i> tucking panty with built in hip pockets designed to hold the custom silicone hip &amp; butt pads we have already designed (we had custom molds made, it was awesome!).</p><p>Many transfeminine folks have already found that using hip and butt pads designed for cis women don't work particularly well because of the difference in muscle shape. So we worked with several bodies to create a pad that gives a nice curve that won't come off as comical. Because it's silicone warms up like your body, moves with you, and can be washed unlike foam pads.</p><p>When we hit this 2nd Stretch Goal we will be able to pay our designer to start patterning <i>Morgan</i>, doing the size grading, and creating the samples for us to test drive. That will put us well on our way to a production run of <i>Morgan</i>, with included pads.</p><h3>Other Questions?</h3><p>We have a page dedicated to Post Secondary and <i>Alex</i> on our <a href=""https://www.wearevalid.com/post-secondary/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>. We've posted about our process so far and what we want to do in the future with this line.

BreathableThat means no more heat exhaustion from your undies

These are made with a couple of great fabrics that allow them to stretch where needed and stay put where they need to hold.


Boyshort Cut
Cute
Looks good on pretty much every human
Gender neutral cut


Great Hold
These were tested at varying levels of physical activity to see how well they kept things tucked. Even at high levels of bending, lifting, sitting, standing and walking, Alex performed beautifully.
The most active day (and 14 hours of wear) led to “very slight shifting” and a “minor bump” at the end of the day (7 hours after the last adjustment).

If you are an international backer concerned about shipping fees, we recommend teaming up with nearby friends to become a supporter so that you can split shipping costs.Risks & ChallengesBecause we've done so much of the groundwork before coming to you, there are surprisingly few challenges to overcome for Alex. We have a garment manufacturer that we trust to do the final manufacturing, and we know their work is good because they supplied us with our prototypes. We’re working with a Los Angeles designer and production manager (who specializes in undergarments) to ensure that everything goes smoothly.Shipping is always a challenge, but this is not our first crowdfunding rodeo. We’ve run a very successful Kickstarter campaign with our sibling company, Optimystical Studios, and we’ve worked with a lot of other crowdfunding campaigns as perk suppliers. We’re prepared for all of the usual hiccups that come with shipping specifically and crowdfunding in general.Even if we’re wildly successful, we’re still ordering garments in quantities that are tiny for the industry. That’s okay, because the garment manufacturer we’re working with is set up for both tiny to enormous orders. There is always the risk that they could go out of business before our campaign finishes (they have been in business for 27 years, so this seems unlikely), or that they become overwhelmed with other projects. It’s okay, our production manager has two alternate manufacturers lined up just in case.In a worst case scenario, we’ll let you know that there will be a delay in shipping and keep everyone in the loop about what’s going on. As we have met our goal, everyone will be getting their perks, even if we hit a delay.Other Ways You Can HelpWe get it, money is always tight. That’s okay. Let people know what we’re up to. Share the project on the social media platform of your choice, talk to your friends about it, contact your local Queer Straight Alliance and make sure they’ve heard about it!Do you know buyers for stores that stock other gender affirming garments? Let them know that we would love to supply them with the best tucking panties on the market!Word of mouth is great, and we appreciate you all talking about us.What Else Is In The Works?We've already started work on the 2nd piece of Gender Affirming Shapewear in our Post Secondary line, their name is Morgan. And Morgan is here to give you some curves.Morgan will be a longer leg version of the Alex tucking panty with built in hip pockets designed to hold the custom silicone hip & butt pads we have already designed (we had custom molds made, it was awesome!).Many transfeminine folks have already found that using hip and butt pads designed for cis women don't work particularly well because of the difference in muscle shape. So we worked with several bodies to create a pad that gives a nice curve that won't come off as comical. Because it's silicone warms up like your body, moves with you, and can be washed unlike foam pads.When we hit this 2nd Stretch Goal we will be able to pay our designer to start patterning Morgan, doing the size grading, and creating the samples for us to test drive. That will put us well on our way to a production run of Morgan, with included pads.Other Questions?We have a page dedicated to Post Secondary and Alex on our website. We've posted about our process so far and what we want to do in the future with this line. If you have more questions, please contact us and we will respond as fast as possible.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

This is where, everywhere is quite except you hear the extremely loud engines and your own heartbeat. Hands sweating, teeth grinding, eyes wide open and heads turning for 24 hours. A great watch is not just about a good design and movement. Precision machining, great finishing and quality materials are also what make a watch high quality and beautiful.High polished case, double domed sapphire crystal, decorated quality movement, 3D dial and the super comfortable Italian leather perforated racing style straps make the Distinct 3 watches ""Distinct"". The name says it all.  Distinct 3 Grand Prix Ferro & Company We have spent the past 18 months designing the Distinct 3 watches, inspired by the most aggressive car races in history, where unbelievably fast cars and bold drivers race for 24 hours none-stop to push their limits fearlessly.  As years went by, we have listened to our fans requests. They have been asking about introducing a Distinct watch model with a smaller case with an upgraded movements and a sleeker design. So, we got to our drawing board in late 2018 and came up with the new Distinct 3 models.   All Distinct 3 pre-ordered from are backed by a whopping 5 Year International Warranty! How cool is that! Distinct 3 will be available in 3 styles (GLF Series / Grand Prix Series / Petrol Series) and 3 different movements (Swiss ETA 2824 Automatic,  Miyota 9015 Japan Automatic and Swiss Ronda 715 Quartz). Each movement will be  limited to 1000 units.DISTINCT 3 MODEL  GLF  LE MANS Available in Swiss Automatic ETA 2824 Automatic,  Miyota 9015 Japan Automatic and Swiss Ronda 715 Quartz).   DISTINCT 3 MODEL Grand PrixAvailable in Swiss Automatic ETA 2824 Automatic,  Miyota 9015 Japan Automatic and Swiss Ronda 715 Quartz).   DISTINCT 3 MODEL PetrolAvailable in Swiss Automatic ETA 2824 Automatic,  Miyota 9015 Japan Automatic and Swiss Ronda 715 Quartz).   The dials of Quartz models are the same as the Automatic models. The only difference is that the word ""Automatic"" is not shown.  Look compelling day and night with Super Luminova powerful C3 lume on the dial.   Case: 42 mm Lugs: 22 mm Lug to lug: 48 mm Thickness: 13.1 mm including top crystal Crown: 8 mm / Screw in  Dial Opening: 36 mm Case Material: High Grade Stainless Steel Polished finish Crystal: Scratch Resistant Domed Sapphire Crystal with Anti-reflective Coating / Quartz models will be with Flat Sapphire Crystal Back Case: Screw Down Stainless Steel / display back  Lume: Super Luminova C3 Straps: Finest Italian Leather / perforated racing style / comfort fit Water Resistance: 100 Meters (10 BAR)Movement:  Automatic Swiss ETA 2824 Automatic,  Miyota 9015 Japan Automatic and Swiss Ronda 715 Quartz). Each movement will  / Automatic Japan Miyota 9015 with in-house decorations / Swiss Quartz Ronda 715Please note that if ETA movement is not available, Sellita SW200 will be used which is the exact same movement from a different Swiss company.  The Distinct 3 watches are constructed with polished 42 mm Stainless Steel Cases that house an Automatic Swiss ETA 2824,  Miyota 9015 Japan, or Swiss Ronda 715 Qaurtz  movements. The Distinct 3.0 series also come with comfortable and soft perforated racing style Italian leather straps with stainless steel pin buckle.   The double domed scratch resistant sapphire crystal (for automatic models) with double sided anti-reflecting coating protects the revamped Motorsports inspired dial and reduces the reflection for better time reading. Quartz models will come with flat sapphire crystal.  The high performance machinery that our partnering manufacturers use can make small details with perfection such as the onion style crown with our ""F"" logo:The dual layered dial with tapered edge pushes the boldness and sportiness look of this watch design further.Although these watches are designed for driving and casual wear, they are 100 meters water resistant. At Ferro & Company, we only use the highest-grade materials to make sure that all our watches far exceed our fans expectations. For this reason, we have decided to choose 3 great movements as below:Swiss ETA 2824 MovementThe ETA 2824  is one of the most well-known and most recognized movements in the watch industry. It has 26 jewels with 38 hours of power reserve.  ETA 2824 movement will keep your time  accurate for a very long time.  Miyota Caliber 9015 Japan Automatic Movement The Miyota caliber 9015 is a 24 jewel automatic Japan movement equipped with a ball bearing rotor, a second stop and a date with a quick-change circuit, this movement works very precisely with 28,800 half oscillations per hour. Furthermore, the movement has a shock absorber, a Swiss anchoring inhibitor and a manual hoist. The reserve is 42 hours.   Swiss Ronda 715 Quartz MovementRonda 715 quartz movement has a very long battery-life (up to 10 years) and is very well known for its accuracy and longevity.This is the back case of the Quartz models  FAST AND LEGENDARY The epic, day-long race that winds through the little French hamlet in Northwest France is officially called 24 Hours of Le Mans (24 Heures du Mans in French), but those in the motoring world simply refer to it as “Le Mans"". It has been called the most thrilling 24 hours in motor sports.  Le Mans has seen  speed records broken again and again (up to 405 k/ph), and plenty of unbelievably fast super cars. It has long been at the forefront of automotive pioneering and innovation issuing from major car companies, spurred on by a desire to beat their rivals out for the claim to the illustrious championship, and status as the most rugged, durable super car maker in the world. It is a deep, and rich history, full of innovation and brilliance, wild stories, sometimes catastrophic mishaps. To understand Le Mans is to understand the history of European – and eventually American – auto racing at large; to see how the tides shifted, trends started, and how companies rose and fell from prominence like spokes on a wheel.  Distinct 3 watch is so smart that it can tell you the time with just one hand!One hand watches are very unique in style and are getting quite popular.The 12-hour dial is divided by 144 markers. Each marker represents 5 minutes.The combination of the bold 15, 30 and 45-minute markers and the prominent needle pointer make it easy to read time.  By looking at the single hand watch you can tell the time within +/- 2 to 5 minute discrepancy .Below are some examples:  It's easy to have customers but it is mighty hard to have FANS that spread their love. AS SEEN ON Ferro & Company is an independent direct to consumer, Canadian watch brand established by 2 brothers and watch aficionados in Vancouver, British Columbia.

Pour cette raison, nous avons décidé de choisir 3 grands mouvements pour ces montres : Le mouvement automatique suisse ETA 2824 le plus populaire au monde, , le mouvement automatique japonais Miyota 9015 et le mouvement à quartz suisse Ronda 715.Calibre suisse ETA 2824​ Mouvement automatiqueLe calibre ETA 2824 est l'un des mouvements les plus connus et les plus reconnus de l'industrie horlogère. Il dispose de 26 rubis avec 38 heures de réserve de marche. Le mouvement ETA 2824 gardera votre temps précis pendant très longtemps.  Calibre japon miyota 9015 Mouvement automatiqueLe calibre Miyota 9015est un mouvement japonais automatique à 24 rubis qui a été introduit pour la première fois en 2009. Il s'agit d'un développement révolutionnaire du calibre 8015. Equipé d'un rotor à roulement à billes, d'un second arrêt et d'une date avec un circuit de changement rapide, ce mouvement fonctionne de manière très précise avec 28 800 demi-oscillations par heure. De plus, le mouvement est équipé d'un amortisseur, d'un inhibiteur d'ancrage suisse et d'un palan manuel. La réserve de marche est de 42 heures. Le mouvement est un chef-d'œuvre technique en raison de sa faible hauteur totale de seulement 3,9 mm.Calibre suisse Ronda 715 Mouvement quartzLe mouvement à quartz Ronda 715 a une très longue durée de vie de la pile (jusqu'à 10 ans) et est très connu pour sa précision et sa longévité.  L’inspirationRAPIDE ET LÉGENDAIRELa course épique d'une journée qui se déroule dans le petit hameau français du nord-ouest de la France est officiellement appelée 24 heures du Mans, mais le monde automobile l'appelle simplement ""Le Mans"". Ce sont les 24 heures les plus palpitantes du sport automobile. Comment lire l'heureLa montre Distinct 3 est si intelligente qu'elle peut vous indiquer l'heure avec une seule aiguille!Les montres à une main ont un style unique et sont de plus en plus populaires.Le cadran des 12 heures est divisé par 144 index. Chaque marqueur représente 5 minutes.La combinaison des marqueurs gras de 15, 30 et 45 minutes et de l'aiguille proéminente permet de lire l'heure facilement. En regardant la montre à une aiguille, vous pouvez lire l'heure avec un écart de +/- 2 à 5 minutes.Vous trouverez ci-dessous quelques exemples :Calendrier Réservez votre montre :Vous pouvez réserver votre Ferro & Co.

<p>Nzo has been based in<strong> Rotorua, making things for mountain bikers, since 1998.</strong> Our big idea when we started was if we make stuff that we like, we were pretty sure some other people would like it too. </p>
<p>21 years down the trail we still have that same idea, and we are still designing things in Rotorua that find a home with trail fanatics all over the world. Every Nzo product we sell is designed by us and tested individually by the people who own the company.   </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have been designing gears for mountain bikers, since 1998. With our team, we launched our line of durable outdoor wears in New Zealand, our hometown. Since then, we gain an extensive experience in manufacturing high-quality durable apparel as well as fulfilling lots of orders worldwide. <br/>We produced, modified, revised quite a few samples of the Duster pants until we feel like we have the best possible product we can offer. <br/>We have already queued our manufacturers and booked the fabric to ensure production as soon as we are funded. <br/>Our fulfilment platform is already operational and has been tested to ensure smooth and traceable delivery process. <br/>But sometimes things happen and as much as we are prepared, some issues are just unavoidable like fabric delays due to yarn being stuck in customs. <br/>We add time buffer for these events, but sometimes it's not enough. <br/>Be reassure that we are deeply committed to and excited about delivering, on time, a high-quality product that we know you'll enjoy for a long time to come.</p>

Saul is wearing a Large size (for looser fit) - Nathalie is wearing a Medium size (for Slim fit) 
This slim fit organic cotton T is so comfortable Natalie (our model, and resident baker of cakes) immediately ordered two for herself and Saul (our model, and wheel-builder) didn't want to take it off. 
It is a 185 gsm in a very high quality knit, with all the details a premium t shirt should have: matching rib collar on a v neck, taped back neck and shoulder seams, bartacked overlocking on the sleeves and hem for durability.


Natalie is the perfect Medium according to our fit chart, and a Medium is the size she is modelling. 

Saul would generally be a Medium but he preferred the Large, which looks great and feels great too. 

Check out the fitting guide ..if you like a looser fit, just go up a size from what you normally wear. 

Jeremy (our model here) is wearing a Size Medium Cotton T and Medium - Tall Dusters (Numbers are in cm)

NZO dusters will be packed using the Hydropol® patent, providing a sustainable solution to plastic end of life. 
The bag is super resistant, marine safe and biodegradable. Hydropol® is a clear and flexible food-grade plastic that dissolves completely in hot water. Once dissolved, Hydropol® biodegrades to a benign biomass, carbon dioxide and water, and can be safely flushed away with wastewater.  
We are proud to partner with Aquapak in providing a more sustainable outlook for the textile and e-commerce industries.

Original authentic design for trail fanatics
Nzo has been based in Rotorua, making things for mountain bikers, since 1998. Our big idea when we started was if we make stuff that we like, we were pretty sure some other people would like it too. 
21 years down the trail we still have that same idea, and we are still designing things in Rotorua that find a home with trail fanatics all over the world. Every Nzo product we sell is designed by us and tested individually by the people who own the company.   

 



 
We’ve had incredible experiences bike-packing in every kind of landscape. We have been mountain biking since the sport got started.
We love being outdoor and we love having the right gear. Our mission is to design timeless and functional gear. 
We take the lessons learned from decades of making stuff for mountain bikers and apply them to the perfect pair of pants for anybody heading outdoors. 
 

Gaz Sullivan (Founder) learned to ride a bicycle at age 5, and started racing bikes at 14. He represented his club, his region, and his country, before switching his attention to a career in graphic design. He got into mountain biking as soon as it was invented, and has been involved in the sport ever since.
Glen Anderson (Founder) used a bike for transport while she developed a career in the design and manufacturing of apparel. 
When we started thinking about the right kit for mountain biking the sport had yet to define itself - there was literally

Olivier Courret (Partner & Director)is up most mornings at 4.30 to live a triathlete life. Olivier has spent 20 years working in the sports industry - designing, innovating, procuring, and manufacturing performance and technical sportswear for brands in Asia and France.

Simon Tsang, our Marketing Guy who has a passion for crafting the hoppiest ale to canyon carving on a sunny day joins the team with his Marketing background. Helping NZO launch our first Kickstarter and driving the campaign forward. His valuable input
brings us confidence in smashing our first Kickstarter!  
Suzanne Lim our pilot during the whole Kickstarter project. She is a freediver athlete who has her own freediving company in Asia. During the product development, pre-campaign, campaign and post campaign, she coordinates and organises the workflow

Kenneth Lam - Brought our NZO dusters to life with amazing campaign visuals. From concept to creation, videography to photography, he can do everything. Except hiking, but for us, he did that too.

The wool fiber adapts to perform and keep the sheep both comfortable and protected from the elements over a wide range of temperatures, from 5 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The fiber's unique crimped structure insulates in winter and breathes in summer, allowing the sheep to comfortably live in extreme weather variations while protecting them from the elements. Additionally, the unique chemical structure of the wool fiber enables it to absorb and lock away odors.

 What makes the Limitless Merino Wool Shirt so revolutionary?Most trips require multiple shirts for various purposes. The Limitless Merino Wool Shirt replaces three or more shirts in your bag. It’s built to stay fresh for days, move with you, pack small, and look clean, allowing you to do more with less. Ditch the big suitcase - do more and see more.Being active in a traditional button-down means being hot and sweaty. It simply can’t keep up. The Limitless Merino Wool Shirt naturally resists stains, has UPF of 40+, is incredibly breathable, and stretches with your body in every direction. Finally, a shirt that can keep up with you.Traditional button-downs are restricting, stiff, and scratchy. The Limitless Merino Wool Shirt stretches to allow full range of motion, is softer than a t-shirt, and will keep you dry and comfortable. The secret is in the Merino wool and polyester blend, leveraging each material’s best traits to create the most comfortable button-down shirt you’ll ever wear. 
 
 When we set out to build a shirt as dynamic as your daily life, we knew we had to start with the fabric. Merino wool is quite simply the best natural performance fiber available. So, we partnered with the The Woolmark Company, utilizing the latest technology to build the ultimate performance Merino wool blend shirt fabric. Our unique knit fabric blends 53% Australian Merino wool and 47% polyester to create a fabric that is soft, machine washable, odor and wrinkle resistant, temperature regulating, and moves with your body. The ultimate performance fabric for any activity.The performance of the Merino wool comes from the fleece of the Merino sheep. The wool fiber adapts to perform and keep the sheep both comfortable and protected from the elements over a wide range of temperatures, from 5 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The fiber's unique crimped structure insulates in winter and breathes in summer, allowing the sheep to comfortably live in extreme weather variations while protecting them from the elements. Additionally, the unique chemical structure of the wool fiber enables it to absorb and lock away odors. We specifically used Merino wool because it is the finest of the wool varieties, making it exceptionally soft and lightweight. This special fiber is blended with polyester and constructed into a unique engineered knit fabric to enhance its performance and give you ultimate range of movement and style. The engineered knit creates a honeycomb structure, which provides a nice texture to the fabric while lifting it off the skin, further enhancing the temperature regulation of the wool. Its construction provides extensive 4-way stretch to move with your body.*Image Courtesy of The Woolmark Company

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">We are proud to announce the pre-launch of our newest functional fashion product “SOLZbag”, a solar powered backpack that functions as a personal portable power station. The bag is designed with three 1.5-watt solar panels that will give a total of 4.5 watt charge to a removable lithium-ion battery; the battery is versatile and also can be charged by a computer or any power source available. Once the battery is charged, it can be connected to almost any small personal electronic device using a variety of power adaptors that come with it. The bag also includes a front pocket, specially designed to hold a pair of SOLZshoes. The bag contains a dedicated padded laptop or tablet sleeve and an additional sunglass and accessory pocket.</span></p>

For thousands of years, we've shared and sold custom-built products with each other. Then came the Industrial Revolution. For all its commercial benefits, it also brought lifeless homogenization. The individual's voice was snuffed out! We want to bring back that voice and put the 'custom' back into 'customer,' enabling the once-passive consumer to engage in the utterly human act of creativity. No more zombie shopping..
  Everything is now Remixable & One-of-a-kind!
JuicyCanvas takes an artist's ""finished"" artwork and automagically unlocks it for further personalization and experimentation. With just a few simple clicks, you can change colors and artwork can be rotated, resized and repositioned to create your personalized REMIXED work. (No artists harmed in the making of JuicyCanvas)
Our collection only includes works from artists who have signed on to our bold vision of customizable art. By allowing us to use their work they'll get:

Greater name recognition from the public at large.

Royalties each time their art is remixed and purchased by one of our customers.








    
    After working on this part-time for over 1 year, we've built a solid prototype: JuicyCanvas.com

<p>My name is Breck and I am a freelance photographer and Khmer interpreter. It's a bit of a long story how I ended up here, but I'll spare you the details.</p>
<p>Anyway. Can you go grab your phone right now? Yes, I'm talking to you. Go ahead.</p>
<p>Are we set? Great! Now go ahead and open your photo app.</p>
<p>How many photos do you have in there? 100? 200? 1,000??</p>
<p>Photos. So many photos.</p>
<p>They are everywhere today. It's estimated that over 1.4 billion photos are taken everyday with mobile devices, and about half of those end up on social networks. With such big numbers, it's easy to take a simple image for granted.</p>
<p>For every great meme, food shot and profile pic you see online, there is someone who does not have the resources to capture just one small moment in their life. Imagine living in circumstances where you don’t have any photos. No photos of loved ones, living or deceased. No photos of your family and the people you care about. It's hard to imagine, but across the world there are many families that don't have the means for something that has almost become disposable in most modern societies.</p>
<p><img alt=""A house in the countryside where a family of 7 lives."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.brecksargent.com/ks/house.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This is where I, with your help, hope to make a small change!</p>
<p>I'm planning a trip to Cambodia to visit some of these communities off the grid, and creating quality 8x10 portraits of these beautiful families for the first time. I will have portable printers on hand to print for them on site and give away. With your help, we can give these families a priceless gift they otherwise may have never had the opportunity to enjoy.</p>
<p> <img alt=""A Pnong village in the Mondulkiri Province"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.brecksargent.com/ks/pnong.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img alt=""Pnong Villager"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.brecksargent.com/ks/srey.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>While my flight and camera gear are being covered out of pocket, I do need funds for printing equipment, portable power, transportation and a local guide/assistant for the project. The remaining funds will be used for the production costs for the awards to our awesome backers, and possibly future family portrait projects around the world. I will be able to visit at least 3 locations with my budgeted goal. If we only make it halfway, 2 locations. And if we go over, I will go to as many locations as the budget allows!</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of expenses:</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.brecksargent.com/ks/cost.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In December of 2011, I had the privilege of doing a help-portrait photoshoot with a couple of co-workers at Lowell Elder Care, which is a non-profit for Elderly Cambodians in Lowell, MA. We took so many great photos, and the Elders absolutely loved it! You can take a look at the gallery here: <a href=""http://www.brecksargent.com/hp2011"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.brecksargent.com/hp2011</a></p>
<p>Fast forward to December 2012. I was approached by the Director of Lowell Elder Care at one of the local parties in Lowell and he informed me that one of the Elders we photographed passed away. He later went on to tell me that the family used the 8x10 photo we took at our shoot the previous year. At his funeral. They were extremely grateful for the photo they didn't have, and never really thought about wanting until his funeral. It's stories like this that get me really excited about the power of photography, despite how often we are inundated with new media every day.</p>

For every great meme, food shot and profile pic you see online, there is someone who does not have the resources to capture just one small moment in their life. Imagine living in circumstances where you don’t have any photos. No photos of loved ones, living or deceased. No photos of your family and the people you care about. It's hard to imagine, but across the world there are many families that don't have the means for something that has almost become disposable in most modern societies.

This is where I, with your help, hope to make a small change!
I'm planning a trip to Cambodia to visit some of these communities off the grid, and creating quality 8x10 portraits of these beautiful families for the first time. I will have portable printers on hand to print for them on site and give away. With your help, we can give these families a priceless gift they otherwise may have never had the opportunity to enjoy.
 

While my flight and camera gear are being covered out of pocket, I do need funds for printing equipment, portable power, transportation and a local guide/assistant for the project. The remaining funds will be used for the production costs for the awards to our awesome backers, and possibly future family portrait projects around the world. I will be able to visit at least 3 locations with my budgeted goal. If we only make it halfway, 2 locations. And if we go over, I will go to as many locations as the budget allows!
Here is a breakdown of expenses:

 
In December of 2011, I had the privilege of doing a help-portrait photoshoot with a couple of co-workers at Lowell Elder Care, which is a non-profit for Elderly Cambodians in Lowell, MA. We took so many great photos, and the Elders absolutely loved it! You can take a look at the gallery here: www.brecksargent.com/hp2011
Fast forward to December 2012. I was approached by the Director of Lowell Elder Care at one of the local parties in Lowell and he informed me that one of the Elders we photographed passed away. He later went on to tell me that the family used the 8x10 photo we took at our shoot the previous year. At his funeral. They were extremely grateful for the photo they didn't have, and never really thought about wanting until his funeral. It's stories like this that get me really excited about the power of photography, despite how often we are inundated with new media every day.

Thank you for visting! If you have any questions or suggestions please let me know.

<p><b>Q. Does <i>goStrap</i> provide a

<p><b>A.</b> <i>goStrap</i> features an innovative 3M adhesive that forms a strong,
long-lasting bond but is cleanly removable and leaves no residue. </p>
<p><b>Q. Is<i> goStrap</i> reusable?</b></p>
<p><b>A.</b>  No. goStrap is a one-time use product because the adhesive will no longer
possess its full integrity once its bond is broken. <br/></p><p><b>Q. Does it/will it come in colors? </b></p>
<p><b>A.</b>
Yes. As we get into production, <i>goStrap</i> will be available in black,
pink, and blue. Additionally, as we grow, an almost limitless array of
colorways and designs are possible. These can include screen-printed designs,
team colors and logos, appliques, adornments, and appointments such as dazzles
and jewels. </p>
<p><b>Q. What devices is <i>goStrap</i>
for use with?</b></p>
<p><b>A.</b>
The current size <i>goStrap</i> is suitable for use on smaller, handheld
mobile devices such as cellular phones, mp3 players, and e-readers. Currently
we are also in development of our 2nd generation <i>goStrap</i> dedicated for
use with tablet computers such as the IPAD. </p>
<p><b>Q. Can <i>goStrap</i> be used in
conjunction with existing cases?</b></p>
<p><b>A.</b> <i>goStrap</i> will adhere and can be a great companion to most existing hard-shell and hard-rubber cases.
It will not adhere to silicone rubber or cases that have extremely un-unified
surfaces, such as cases with a lot of bling, dazzles, or deep and/or knobby
tread. </p>

A.  No. goStrap is a one-time use product because the adhesive will no longer
possess its full integrity once its bond is broken. Q. Does it/will it come in colors? 
A.
Yes. As we get into production, goStrap will be available in black,
pink, and blue. Additionally, as we grow, an almost limitless array of
colorways and designs are possible. These can include screen-printed designs,
team colors and logos, appliques, adornments, and appointments such as dazzles
and jewels. 
Q. What devices is goStrap
for use with?
A.
The current size goStrap is suitable for use on smaller, handheld
mobile devices such as cellular phones, mp3 players, and e-readers. Currently
we are also in development of our 2nd generation goStrap dedicated for
use with tablet computers such as the IPAD. 
Q. Can goStrap be used in
conjunction with existing cases?
A. goStrap will adhere and can be a great companion to most existing hard-shell and hard-rubber cases.
It will not adhere to silicone rubber or cases that have extremely un-unified
surfaces, such as cases with a lot of bling, dazzles, or deep and/or knobby
tread.",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

Anne. I am a 26-year old entrepreness from Calgary, Alberta with a shoe fascination
that can rival the very best. I started this project about two years ago. At
the time I was having issues keeping my purses from being lost or left behind. I’ve
left them in cabs, at restaurants, in theatres and night clubs. I was lucky
enough to be re-united with a few of them but the ones that we’re lost we’re
always traumatizing. I started keeping my phone and cash in my knee-highs
(which I always wore). This worked reasonably well until the bartenders gave me
$8 in change and I would have to walk around all night with a Loonie under my
foot.</span></p><p></p><p></p>

unsuccessful search for boots with hidden pockets (I had assumed this would have
been done before), I decided to make them myself. It started off as something I
just wanted to do for me until I had amassed a list of girlfriends who also
wanted a pair. I even had some of my male friends asking about them; they we’re
tired of having to hold their girlfriend’s lipsticks.</span></p><p></p><p></p>

</div></div>","WELCOME TO OUR PROJECT!
We have designed the world's first purse for your feet! Purse n'
Boots is a revolutionary new boot created with patent-pending pockets hidden on
the inside of the shoe. Our mission is to give women the opportunity to dance,
travel, or shop without having to haul a purse along. Although we all love our
classic black Gucci bag, it can be a chore to carry at times. 
 

THE BOOTS
Each boot has a special purpose and hidden surprise. Your left
boot has a pocket designed specifically to fit the iPhone, Blackberry, and
any other phone of that size. If you are one of the strong willed who can leave
their phone at home, than this pocket can be used for makeup, lipsticks, and
much more. Your right boot has a special built-in wallet that is perfect for
credit cards, ID, folded cash and even loose change.
 
What is the most exciting part of this concept? It’s hidden! The
next time you walk through security at a concert, you will feel a tinge of
guilt as the contents of your girlfriend’s purse are dumped out in line to be
search and approved. You however, will walk right through.
 
In addition to our secret pockets, we pride ourselves in finding
the highest quality leathers and creating the most comfortable shoe on the
market (while still maintaining a competitive style). Our boots are designed to
outlast. There is nothing more depressing than having to retire a pair of your “old
faithfuls”, so to prolong this mournful day, we make a long lasting boot that
will be a friend to your feet for years to come.


ABOUT THE DESIGNER
My name is Elizabeth
Anne. I am a 26-year old entrepreness from Calgary, Alberta with a shoe fascination
that can rival the very best. I started this project about two years ago. At
the time I was having issues keeping my purses from being lost or left behind. I’ve
left them in cabs, at restaurants, in theatres and night clubs. I was lucky
enough to be re-united with a few of them but the ones that we’re lost we’re
always traumatizing. I started keeping my phone and cash in my knee-highs
(which I always wore). This worked reasonably well until the bartenders gave me
$8 in change and I would have to walk around all night with a Loonie under my
foot.
 
After a long and
unsuccessful search for boots with hidden pockets (I had assumed this would have
been done before), I decided to make them myself. It started off as something I
just wanted to do for me until I had amassed a list of girlfriends who also
wanted a pair. I even had some of my male friends asking about them; they we’re
tired of having to hold their girlfriend’s lipsticks.
 
The last two years
have been fun, challenging, and extremely rewarding. My first shipment of boots
is arriving in a couple weeks and will be delivered to the lucky customers that
snapped them up before they we’re sold out. It’s been an amazing thing for me
to watch an idea turn into a dream come true. 

MEET THE TEAM

Free Press, Metro News, Calgary Herald HERS Magazine, CBC Radio, String
Magazine, Good News Weekly, and Fashion Sign Magazine.

WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP
We are looking to raise $15,000 to help us meet our up and
coming initiatives. I have listed our objectives in order of importance:
1.    Raise capital for latest project - Talk n' Walk Cell Phone and Wallet Pocket: Customize your boots with a removable version of our Purse n’
Boots cell phone pocket. This pocket is designed to fit cell phones like the
Blackberry, iPhone or any other phone of that size. The pocket is expandable
too, allowing you to carry your folded cash and credit cards as well. If you
are strong willed and can leave your phone at home, this pocket can be used for
makeup, keys, and other small items. The Purse n’ Boots concept is no longer just
for women, the Talk n’ Walk pockets will fit into both men’s and women’s boots!
2.    Add
sizes 5 and 11 to our catalogue: Purse n’ Boots is currently only available in sizes 6 through
10; we have had a lot of requests for a smaller and larger size so getting these sizes into our catalogue is top priority.
3.    Start
production of a flat-heeled version of Purse n’ Boots: I know there are a lot of you out there that
cannot where heels and we would like very much to be able to provide you with a
flat heeled design.
 
We have broken down our objectives in order of importance to show
you where your money will be prioritized. In the event that we do not meet our
campaign goals, your donations will still be put to productive use starting
with objective one.

<p>Base and the sole of Bebbos are also made from natural wool. However, so they are durable and steady, we twist and layer single yarns into ply yarns, and then twist them into a cord. Number of yarn layers give us thickness, and durability. With this, because wool is a breathable fibre, footwear is not rigid, and still is soft and comfortable.<br/></p>

<br/><p><b>What we will do for our society </b></p>
<p>After our first quarter, 3% of all GCRA Clothing sales will be donated to the Gutter Chyld Foundation. Our non-profit organization. This will provide care and relief to adopted children and parents stuck in the gutter, who need our help. We are committed to making the world a better place to live in. for our kids and our kids, kids. We believe everyone deserves a second chance. We have all made it thus far. If we can make one ripple in the water, to allow the Gutter Chyldren  of the world to drink from the fountain of life. Then we have succeeded.  If we make a wave, we make this impossible, possible. We are more than clothing company; we are creators of a new image and an epic way of life.</p>

<br/><br/><b>Advantage of GCRA Clothing</b><p>GCRA Clothing is going to flip the market upside down and offer a creative alternative to tired mainstream clothes you find on the racks today. GCRA Clothing is a fresh new brand and is more than putting   clothes on bodies. It’s about getting in their heads and allowing Gutter Chyldren to feel good about the clothes they wear, knowing they are a member of a unique VIP club who choose not to settle for everything else. We unite as one, unlike any other brand on the market. We plan to build a nonprofit foundation to help people down and out, in the Gutter. We are seeking out workers, volunteers and Gutter Chyldren to make the foundation grow. The most important aspect of being a reformed Gutter Chyld is the ability to not go back to the gutter but remember where you came from and the road you walked to get there. </p>

What we will do for our society 
After our first quarter, 3% of all GCRA Clothing sales will be donated to the Gutter Chyld Foundation. Our non-profit organization. This will provide care and relief to adopted children and parents stuck in the gutter, who need our help. We are committed to making the world a better place to live in. for our kids and our kids, kids. We believe everyone deserves a second chance. We have all made it thus far. If we can make one ripple in the water, to allow the Gutter Chyldren  of the world to drink from the fountain of life. Then we have succeeded.  If we make a wave, we make this impossible, possible. We are more than clothing company; we are creators of a new image and an epic way of life.



Advantage of GCRA ClothingGCRA Clothing is going to flip the market upside down and offer a creative alternative to tired mainstream clothes you find on the racks today. GCRA Clothing is a fresh new brand and is more than putting   clothes on bodies. It’s about getting in their heads and allowing Gutter Chyldren to feel good about the clothes they wear, knowing they are a member of a unique VIP club who choose not to settle for everything else. We unite as one, unlike any other brand on the market. We plan to build a nonprofit foundation to help people down and out, in the Gutter. We are seeking out workers, volunteers and Gutter Chyldren to make the foundation grow. The most important aspect of being a reformed Gutter Chyld is the ability to not go back to the gutter but remember where you came from and the road you walked to get there.

</p><p>Daddy GO Bag ""The Bag
With An Afterlife"" was created when I was getting ready to have my first
child. I did not want to carry around my wife's purse.  As a Recon Marine and
Sniper I put my combat gear to the test. I decided to use this same material in
the Daddy GO Bag knowing how well it performed in harsh environments with hard
use. The key is once you are done changing diapers you can turn this bag into a
computer bag, fishing bag, gym bag, hunting bag, tool bag, camera bag and any
other bag that requires functionality and durability.  This one bag takes
the place of many bags saving you lots of money.  The bag was designed so
you can change your babies diaper with one hand on the baby and the other
grabbing the diaper changing gear without having to unzip the bag.  Proud
fathers can now keep their dignity by using a Daddy GO Bag.  Don't forget
""Even though you drive a mini van, you are still a man, Daddy GO
Bag"".<br/></p>
<p>The Daddy GO Bag is
created by a Recon Marine/Sniper. I am raising funds for inventory to sell on
Amazon, EBay and the Daddy GO Bag website. This campaign will help with
marketing and national recognition. I will also create a smaller Daddy GO Bag
and a Daddy GO Bag Back Pack. This money will go into the Daddy GO Bag
accessories. Some accessories are a changing kit, bottle insulator, changing
mat, military style baby blanket and dump pouch. Please ignore the $1,000.00
goal.  Daddy GO Bag is a startup and will take as many preorders/donations
as possible.</p>
<p>Everybody gets
a reward for contributing.  With a contribution of $110.00 or
greater, you will get one of the first ever Generation 1 Daddy GO Bags. 
Pick one of these Daddy GO Bags:</p>
<p>Tactical Daddy GO Bag made
with 500D Multicam, 1000D coyote tan Cordura or the Duck Hunting Daddy GO Bag
made with 500D Mossy Oak Shadow Grass Blades and 1000D coyote tan Cordura or
the Tan Casual Daddy GO Bag made with heavy #8 cotton duck water resistant
canvas.</p>
<p>Think of it this way...if
you want a bag and can wait 3 months for delivery you can get a Daddy GO Bag
for $110.00 and that includes shipping, handling and taxes. This is a huge
discount for a Daddy GO Bag.  This would also be a great gift for friends
or family who are expecting, have a baby or someone who needs a rugged
bag. This bag has an AFTERLIFE! When you are done changing diapers you
can convert this bag into a computer bag, camera bag, hunting bag, tool bag,
fishing bag, pic nic bag, medical bag or anything else that requires a durable
and functional bag. 5 or more bags in one, saving you lots of money.

BagUps sets itself apart from ordinary garbage bags in three ways.  First, the bags are pre-loaded so the user never has to put his or her hand in a trash container.  Second, BagUps are produced by veterans and people with disabilities. The bags dispense from a 100% cardboard box in a continuous flow, automatically relining your trash receptacle.  Lastly, the product is oxo-biodegradable, which allows it to breakdown naturally in approximately two years; versus thousands of years it takes other bags to degrade.MAKING A DIFFERENCE BagUps is making a difference one bag at a time in your home, in the lives of veterans and people with disabilities, and in our landfills by being Oxo-biodegradable!

We know people love the product, it has been featured on TV over a dozen times as a great new product, and we sell out at every trade show we attend. Now, we need your support to get it into medium and large-size stores. Retail purchasing agents are taking interest in BagUps for all the reasons we stated already. We have retail purchasing agents interested in the product and getting it on the store shelf, but that is only part of the equation.

We aim to unite the world in our differences, with an obsessive focus on design, production, promotion, consumption and appearance. We deliver jeans to the world with movement, inventive composition, style and classic fits.
THE STORY

In 2011, our co-founders Lexi Cook and Anthony Henderson came together to begin creating the first collection in a small Harlem, New York apartment titled; Amsterden/m Segment. The two sought to combine inspiration from two of Lexi's favorite places Amsterdam and New York City blended with Anthony's love of Classic American denim work wear and functional sports wear. The result; the fusing of Lexi's Dutch obsession with her home base. Anthony's passion for denim, which in his view is as much an original American art form as say Jazz or Rock & Roll. Our love for freedom of movement with functional quality construction. This inspired them to bring these influences together as one through their designs. It's Amsterdam inspired style meets New York City cool combined with Classic Americana. ONE NINE EIGHT FOUR DEN/M.






THE COLLECT/ON

The Amsterden/m Segment Collection consists of 15 pieces for both men and women. Inspired by cycling, each blueprint introduces movement in the details, while skillfully constructed and infused with various washes, stitching, leather straps, finely crafted pockets, buckles, motos, fading, cuffs, and simply put a great deal of originality. 1ne 9ine’s premium denim jeans and shirts will make the original blue jean feel mediocre. ""We were searching for a more formative denim brand to add to our closets and it seemed simple to just create our own.

Considering the safety risks involving regular Outdoor Billboards along highways; where drivers barely divert their attention from the road to read them; the obsolete indoor paper panels only featuring one ad or direction at a time; FadBoard offers endless opportunities. In addition, Indoor TV ads in stores and public areas are inconvenient as they stand above reach near the ceiling where people are technically not looking.</p><p>As for regular TV, research found that 80% of people fast-forward commercials on recorded shows or switch channel to check what’s on elsewhere. Let alone Internet ads, which are too intrusive, and users are more and more equipped with tools to block them.</p><p>FadBoard stands out as the solution for passive ads at the right place and most importantly at the right moment. In fact, people have time to watch and take notes from the ads while waiting in the barrier belt. This invention can be used for Advertising, Internal Information, Menu Information and Brand Building to influence consumer behavior, and thereby enhance customer experience.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/984020/files/20141103192536-Where-to-use-FadBoard.png?1415071536"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/984051/files/20141103194325-BeltLine.png?1415072605"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/984027/files/20141103192842-Design-Manufacturing.png?1415071722"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/984028/files/20141103193005-Design_4.png?1415071805"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/984031/files/20141103193236-Design_5.png?1415071956"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/984038/files/20141103193415-Design_1.png?1415072055"" src="""" style=""""/></p> Other Patented FadBoards Mobel:<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/984054/files/20141103194412-FB_PPA_Drawings-Page-6.jpg?1415072652"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/984055/files/20141103194439-FadBoard-Specifications.png?1415072679"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>See image bellow:</p><ul>

<p></p></div>","FadBoard is a patented system comprising a digital screen on a barrier belt or pole for advertisement. It can bring internet advertisement to anyone including people that are not connected to the internet or not sitting in their living-room watching TVs. Ads will be displayed where people are in line relatively doing nothing. Yet, FadBoard ads will be cheaper than TV Internet, Radio, Paper or billboard. Using a computer tablet on barrier-belt pole, FadBoard is displaying pictures and videos slideshows of ads.Contents are being managed from an online Content Management System (CMS) and customers can open an account in order to upload their ads themselves, pick the time range for the ads to run and checkout all online; in a nutshell, it’s hassle free.All ads will be verified electronically using a programming paradigm and if anything is detected the ad will be flagged for human verification.Compared to traditional advertising, FadBoard is a revolution in many ways. Considering the safety risks involving regular Outdoor Billboards along highways; where drivers barely divert their attention from the road to read them; the obsolete indoor paper panels only featuring one ad or direction at a time; FadBoard offers endless opportunities. In addition, Indoor TV ads in stores and public areas are inconvenient as they stand above reach near the ceiling where people are technically not looking.As for regular TV, research found that 80% of people fast-forward commercials on recorded shows or switch channel to check what’s on elsewhere. Let alone Internet ads, which are too intrusive, and users are more and more equipped with tools to block them.FadBoard stands out as the solution for passive ads at the right place and most importantly at the right moment. In fact, people have time to watch and take notes from the ads while waiting in the barrier belt. This invention can be used for Advertising, Internal Information, Menu Information and Brand Building to influence consumer behavior, and thereby enhance customer experience. Other Patented FadBoards Mobel:See image bellow:

<p><strong>Where Leggaci Began…</strong></p>
<p>When emerging fashion designer, Phoenyx Reign, began sewing at 8 years old little did she know she was destined to change lives with her designs.  How can one change lives with clothing you may ask?  Phoenyx Reign would say… <em>“by dressing your clients from the inside out...”</em> </p>
<p>If you’ve attended one of my shows, you’ve heard me ask the question <em>“What sense does it make to put a beautiful design on a woman that feels like CRAP”?</em>   Along my journey thru design school and into the fashion industry I’ve made a conscious decision to focus on dressing women that the industry doesn’t cater to.  <em>“I wanted to dress women who had fit issues like me… curves… hips, thighs, boobs…  bodies…. real ones”<strong>.</strong></em>  And so I became a custom clothier, and focused primarily on individual designs for private clients with fit issues.  Yet, other women wanted to know how they too could get clothes that fit their curves without having to hire a personal designer.</p>
<p>One of the “staples” of each of my collections has always been a great pair of leggings!  Because I work mostly with curvy and plus models, they have been PLEASANTLY surprised that the leggings felt so great and fit so well!  After hearing more women complain that most of the leggings they were finding in stores being too tight in all the wrong places,  as well as there being limited to NO options of cool, fun, funky, fabrics and styles for thicker ladies… I began offering my leggings for sale and the response has been awesome!! </p>
<p>What makes LEGGACI Leggings by Phoenyx Reign so special? </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>QUALITY:</strong>  I use only the best quality 4-way stretch fabric.  You’ll immediately notice that even when fully stretched you can’t see thru the fabric and won’t be exposing your undergarments!</li>
<li>
<strong>CUT/FIT:</strong>  Although I have a size range, each order is checked against the clients measurements and custom cut to ensure the best fit.</li>
<li>
<strong>CONSTRUCTION:</strong>  Leggaci brand leggings have reinforced seams to prevent pulling.  1in non-roll elastic is used in the waist to prevent the waist from rolling down while wearing.</li>
<li>
<strong>DESIGN:</strong>  Curvy girls like to have fun too!!!!  Thus far I’ve offered options like fun fashion colors, accent zippers, and even lux leggings with bling, chains, and other embellishments.</li>
</ul><p>LEGGACI Leggings by Phoenyx Reign, and the ladies that wear them, need YOUR help to grow this brand and expand the styles offered! Won’t you help by leaving YOUR Leggaci? </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What I’ve Done… What We Need… and What YOU Get</strong></p>
<p>So far, even with limited resources, sooooo much has been accomplished.  I’ve showcased the leggings at several fashion shows to excited audiences.  I’ve perfected the “Leggaci FIT” so as to be able to offer the leggings in different sizes.  I’ve launched the initial designs on my facebook fan page and am gaining more and more followers each day!  Currently, Leggaci leggings are available thru direct sale from me the designer, as well as online thru my etsy store.   I’ve also be blessed to have my first celebrity wearing Leggaci leggings… she’s a beautiful curvy diva, and wanted some FLY leggings for performances!  I made several customs for her... this was the feedback I got...“Your leggings are a HIT around the world”! </p>
<p>At the writing of this campaign I’m just about to run my very first magazine ad for Leggaci!</p>
<p>I plan to continue selling primarily thru my etsy store until there is sufficient funding to launch a full-fledge website exclusively for LEGGACI leggings… I think they’re special enough to deserve their OWN website!</p>
<p>Where will the money you contribute go?</p>

When emerging fashion designer, Phoenyx Reign, began sewing at 8 years old little did she know she was destined to change lives with her designs.  How can one change lives with clothing you may ask?  Phoenyx Reign would say… “by dressing your clients from the inside out...” 
If you’ve attended one of my shows, you’ve heard me ask the question “What sense does it make to put a beautiful design on a woman that feels like CRAP”?   Along my journey thru design school and into the fashion industry I’ve made a conscious decision to focus on dressing women that the industry doesn’t cater to.  “I wanted to dress women who had fit issues like me… curves… hips, thighs, boobs…  bodies…. real ones”.  And so I became a custom clothier, and focused primarily on individual designs for private clients with fit issues.  Yet, other women wanted to know how they too could get clothes that fit their curves without having to hire a personal designer.
One of the “staples” of each of my collections has always been a great pair of leggings!  Because I work mostly with curvy and plus models, they have been PLEASANTLY surprised that the leggings felt so great and fit so well!  After hearing more women complain that most of the leggings they were finding in stores being too tight in all the wrong places,  as well as there being limited to NO options of cool, fun, funky, fabrics and styles for thicker ladies… I began offering my leggings for sale and the response has been awesome!! 
What makes LEGGACI Leggings by Phoenyx Reign so special? 


QUALITY:  I use only the best quality 4-way stretch fabric.  You’ll immediately notice that even when fully stretched you can’t see thru the fabric and won’t be exposing your undergarments!

CUT/FIT:  Although I have a size range, each order is checked against the clients measurements and custom cut to ensure the best fit.

CONSTRUCTION:  Leggaci brand leggings have reinforced seams to prevent pulling.  1in non-roll elastic is used in the waist to prevent the waist from rolling down while wearing.

DESIGN:  Curvy girls like to have fun too!!!!  Thus far I’ve offered options like fun fashion colors, accent zippers, and even lux leggings with bling, chains, and other embellishments.
LEGGACI Leggings by Phoenyx Reign, and the ladies that wear them, need YOUR help to grow this brand and expand the styles offered! Won’t you help by leaving YOUR Leggaci? 
 
What I’ve Done… What We Need… and What YOU Get
So far, even with limited resources, sooooo much has been accomplished.  I’ve showcased the leggings at several fashion shows to excited audiences.  I’ve perfected the “Leggaci FIT” so as to be able to offer the leggings in different sizes.  I’ve launched the initial designs on my facebook fan page and am gaining more and more followers each day!  Currently, Leggaci leggings are available thru direct sale from me the designer, as well as online thru my etsy store.   I’ve also be blessed to have my first celebrity wearing Leggaci leggings… she’s a beautiful curvy diva, and wanted some FLY leggings for performances!  I made several customs for her... this was the feedback I got...“Your leggings are a HIT around the world”! 
At the writing of this campaign I’m just about to run my very first magazine ad for Leggaci!
I plan to continue selling primarily thru my etsy store until there is sufficient funding to launch a full-fledge website exclusively for LEGGACI leggings… I think they’re special enough to deserve their OWN website!
Where will the money you contribute go?


WEBSITE & MARKETING:  LEGGACI needs a home!  I will build a website exclusive to Leggaci.  The reason Leggaci needs its own website apart from my main site it that I also plan to offer clients the option of customizing/personalizing their own pair of leggings via the website!
The marketing campaign for LEGGACI will be both online and in print.
 


LABELS:  Every great brand MUST have a signature label!  Currently I’ve been producing my own labels in small quantity.  It’s time to have the LEGGACI Brand Labels created and produced in quantity.
 


SUPPLIES:  Fabric, Fabric, and more Fabric!  As I said above, curvy girls like to have fun too!!!  I’ve seen some GREAT fashion fabrics… Hey I’m a designer in LA and the garment district is only a stones throw away… but I need to purchase in bulk… bolts at time instead of yards at a time. 
In addition to fabric, additional supplies such as quantity of non-roll elastic, and trims, chains, crystals and stones, zippers, etc for embellishments and design options.


PHOTO SHOOT and LOOKBOOK:  Last, but certainly not least.  I’ll conduct a photo shoot with the celebrity spokes model for the main marketing campaign.  As well as a model shoot for the official Lookbook and website photo gallery.
GOAL:  I believe that with your support, I’ll be able to reach my full funding goal.  However… should we fall short, and not reach the entire goal, I will re-adjust the priorities and implement as many of the above items as possible!  LEGGACI is growing every day, and I believe this campaign will be just the boost needed to fully launch!

sueño…El Angelhelmet</span><br/></p>
<p>Angelhelmet el resultado
de un sueño que tuvimos en Presistem. En su nacimiento, comenzó siendo un casco
electrónico de seguridad integral (CESI), creció transformándose en un casco
inteligente (SMARTHELMET) y ha terminado madurando como un Ángel (ANGELHELMET). Este Ángel es capaz de velar en todo momento por la integridad, la seguridad y
la vida de los trabajadores de minas y operarios de grandes industrias, ya que
una macroindustria puede tener similares peligros que una mina a cielo o rajo
abierto, por lo que la protección es igual para un operario u otro. De hecho
para todo el equipo, sus vidas son igual de importantes imprescindibles y de
valor infinito, son… nuestra prioridad.</p>
<p>Para nosotros éste
sueño, es el futuro y lo hemos hecho realidad tras más de tres años en los que
lo dejamos todo para dar el máximo de nuestras capacidades, todo se ha hecho
posible gracias a un gran esfuerzo exento de interés económico, colaboraciones
de grandes grupos de ingenieros unidos por una idea y científicos que tras
visualizar las posibilidades, no dudaron en formar parte del sueño, trabajando
con  grandes corporaciones como IAT
(Instituto Andaluz de Tecnología) y el CSIC (Centro Superior de Investigaciones
Científicas). Tenemos ya cerca el día en el que la vida de los mineros o de los
trabajadores de industria dentro y fuera de la tierra no correrá peligro.</p>
<p>Cada vez más cerca el
instante en el que la mayor preocupación de una madre o una hija de un minero o
trabajador de riesgo, sea recordar a su padre que no trabaje sin su
Ángel de la guarda.</p>

pero a la vez mas satisfactoria, basta el ayudar a un operario en peligro o  salvar una vida para que nuestros objetivos se vean colmados.
COMO NACIÓ EL SUEÑO DEL ÁNGEL

MOTIVACIÓN





La evolución de un
sueño…El Angelhelmet
Angelhelmet el resultado
de un sueño que tuvimos en Presistem. En su nacimiento, comenzó siendo un casco
electrónico de seguridad integral (CESI), creció transformándose en un casco
inteligente (SMARTHELMET) y ha terminado madurando como un Ángel (ANGELHELMET). Este Ángel es capaz de velar en todo momento por la integridad, la seguridad y
la vida de los trabajadores de minas y operarios de grandes industrias, ya que
una macroindustria puede tener similares peligros que una mina a cielo o rajo
abierto, por lo que la protección es igual para un operario u otro. De hecho
para todo el equipo, sus vidas son igual de importantes imprescindibles y de
valor infinito, son… nuestra prioridad.
Para nosotros éste
sueño, es el futuro y lo hemos hecho realidad tras más de tres años en los que
lo dejamos todo para dar el máximo de nuestras capacidades, todo se ha hecho
posible gracias a un gran esfuerzo exento de interés económico, colaboraciones
de grandes grupos de ingenieros unidos por una idea y científicos que tras
visualizar las posibilidades, no dudaron en formar parte del sueño, trabajando
con  grandes corporaciones como IAT
(Instituto Andaluz de Tecnología) y el CSIC (Centro Superior de Investigaciones
Científicas). Tenemos ya cerca el día en el que la vida de los mineros o de los
trabajadores de industria dentro y fuera de la tierra no correrá peligro.
Cada vez más cerca el
instante en el que la mayor preocupación de una madre o una hija de un minero o
trabajador de riesgo, sea recordar a su padre que no trabaje sin su
Ángel de la guarda.

……dentro de poco, del resto no se habrán de preocupar… por lo que a la
pregunta de... ¿qué hacemos? el equipo tiene claro que es:
”Salvamos Vidas” 


COMPROMISO, DEDICACIÓN Y RIESGO ASUMIDO POR EL EQUIPO
QUE CULMINAN CON LA CREACIÓN DEL CASCO INTELIGENTE 













Hoja de datos técnicos

<h2><strong>What is Swoon?</strong></h2>
<p>A revolutionary cosmetics tool for use in retrieving every last bit of gloss from your favorite lip gloss tube. Swoon comes sheathed in a sleek cover for on-the-go convenience and can easily be stored in your make up bag alongside your favorite gloss.</p>
<p><img alt=""Original Swoon"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://media-cache-ec0.pinterest.com/avatars/getswoon-1351608270_600.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Swoon Lip Gloss Retrieval Tool/Applicator""/></p>
</div>
<h2><strong>Why Swoon?</strong></h2>
<p>I am a lip gloss lover. Not lip stick, lip gloss. I love its sheen, shine and the way it makes my pout perky.  No matter the brand, the applicator never reaches to the bottom of the tube.  I decided to solve the problem,and set out on a mission to create an easy-to-use beauty tool that promises to give you more puck for your buck.</p>
<h2><strong>Our Goal:</strong></h2>
<p>We're raising $9,500 to cover the cost of MOLDS, SAMPLES &amp; PRODUCTION to bring Swoon to life for the millions of lip gloss lovers who hate waste and love to save money!</p>
<p><img alt=""Lip gloss applicators don't reach bottom of tube"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://media-cache-ec2.pinterest.com/upload/564146290791982870_Fg5oGfvW.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Problem Solved by Swoon""/></p>
<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>
<p>Swoon’s flexible application head - made from the same material in fine calligraphy pens - enables lip gloss lovers to access every corner of the bottom of the lip gloss tube. Its extra long applicator neck is designed to reach every spot of the lip gloss tube no matter the brand.  Swoon's elegant and easy to hold handle facilitates a perfect lip gloss application.</p>
<h2><strong>Why is it called swoon?</strong></h2>
<p>Part spoon, part applicator - lip gloss lovers will “swoon” over this tool's money saving, product-extending powers.</p>
<h2><strong>How is it different from a lip brush?</strong></h2>
<p>A lip brush is for application only and does not help save product. Most lip brushes are too wide to fit into the mouth of a tube of lip gloss, and even if they can fit into the tube, the brush is not designed to retrieve gloss from every corner of the tube. Swoon’s long, thin neck was specifically designed to easily fit into the opening of lip gloss tubes.</p>
<h2><strong>Do I need to purchase a new Swoon for each lip gloss tube?</strong></h2>
<p>Like a lip brush, Swoon can be used across multiple lip gloss colors.  Unlike traditional lip gloss applicators with sponge tips, Swoon’s applicator tip does not absorb the gloss.  If desired, the tip can be easily cleaned with the swipe of a baby wipe.</p>
<h2><strong>Will Swoon work with every brand of lip gloss tube? Have you tested this?</strong></h2>
<p>Yes, it’s been tested with nearly every brand of prestige lip gloss available at department stores.</p>
<h2><strong>Why should I choose Swoon?</strong></h2>
<p>One third of women surveyed* agreed that their inability to get every last bit of gloss from their lip gloss tube is a point of pain. The cost of a prestige lip gloss tube can range between $21 – $49, but traditional applicators leave 1/5 of the gloss (and your money) behind in the tube. So, if you take the average price of $35/tube and the Swoon savings of $7/tube x 4 (the number of tubes purchased by the average gloss wearer annually) = $28 per year or $1,764 over a lip gloss wearer’s lifetime.</p>
<h2><strong>I'm a guy, why do I care?</strong></h2>
<p>If you're a guy who likes girls who like gloss, you'll win their favor when you show up with this cutting edge, money saving cosmetics tool.  If you don't like girls who like gloss, but you love beer and for some reason couldn't access 1/5th of the beer in your beer bottle, and someone gave you a tool to get to it, wouldn't you buy it?</p>
<h2><strong>How will you use the money raised on Indiegogo?</strong></h2>
<p>Money raised via <a href=""http://Kickstarter.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">indiegogo.com</a> will go toward the development of molds, samples and production. Our manufacturer is PLA Moulds, based in China.  It will take 40 days for molds to be developed. Once we recieve and approve the molds and samples, it will take another 12 days to produce the first run of Swoon.  It will ship from our manufacturer in China to our distributor, Thill Logistics in Wisconsin and then to you, our Swoon supporters. Swoon supporters will be the very first to exclusively receive Swoon before it’s available in stores all while maximizing their favorite gloss.</p>

<h3>A Brief Look at a Life Inspired</h3>
<p>        My name is Connally McDougall and I'm a tailor from Victoria, BC, Canada, but I grew up in Mittersill, Austria and Budapest, Hungary, while my parents served as missionaries. I learned to sew from my grandmother and then from older craftswomen in the towns where I lived. From traditional dirndls and lederhosen to costumes for theatre in Budapest, I was blessed to see from an early age how much time and work go into making one garment. My exposure to global cultures and a deliberate way of dressing make me acutely aware of the damage disposable clothing makes on the environment and society. It's better to buy one piece of outstanding quality than dozens of cheaper things that will fall apart. My vision is to have a fashion house that celebrates global traditions but also employs women in indigenous contexts for their artistic craft in beading, leathers, painted silks, etc and advocating fair and equitable wages. As the fashion industry continues to grow, it's important to have each stakeholder’s voice heard. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>           Until last August, I was entirely self taught. However, after hosting a silent auction in Victoria, BC, I raised $3700--enough money to take a short course at the highly prestigious Central Saint Martins (CSM) School of Design in London. I excelled in the focused environment and have been accepted to study full time in Fashion Design Womenswear beginning September 23rd of this year. Collectively from all fine arts disciplines, CSM has 1900 students. Each year out of thousands of applications, ten candidates are interviewed for each available spot. Out of hundreds of applicants, my portfolio was chosen to join the program. I am still pinching myself! The offer to learn from the best opens a menagerie of doors for me. At CSM, it's not about learning the fastest, cheapest way to make clothing, but rather the best way. As an artist, entrepreneur and as a woman, to be granted the opportunity to work hard and live out my vision at the highest level possible is astounding. I can't believe that I not only have found my passion, but have also found a path for my future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>             Using architectural silhouettes and rich details, I design for confident international women. Colour, texture and quality are fundamental for me. My work celebrates the curvature and angularity of the human body. Balancing geometry and the cerebral side of design with instinct and passion is the goal. My perspective is to show not just a woman's beauty, but also her intellect, determination and strength. Exposed flesh alone does not denote sensuality.  While  my theory and concept are clear and I can express how the garment could be put together, without guidance I cannot fully articulate my goal of having a couture fashion house. I want to grow and improve and I know there is  a broader audience for my fashion concepts, but I have only two hands.  Because I’ve taught myself the techniques with books and practiced into very late nights, I’ve made my way through sewing custom designs for years.  I have often taken on projects not knowing how to physically sew them but muscling through with research,passion and determination. It is a roundabout way of learning that accommodates the work I do for clients, but I've burst through the glass ceiling and am ready to study, design and succeed on an international stage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>             I've spent years trying to be the best patternmaker, the best tailor, the best seamstress, the best marketer, the best researcher, and the most innovative designer on my own. It’s impossible. My capacity to self-educate has taken me this far and to continue, I need the direction and collaborative support that only Central Saint Martins provides. I am humbled to be accepted into a program that will change my life, my family's lives and maybe your life too. Alumni from the fashion programs include Bruce Oldfield, John Galliano, Stella McCartney, Alexander McQueen, Phoebe Philo and the school works directly with the major fashion houses. Graduates from CSM are abundantly supported. A degree from CSM is regarded as comparable to one from Oxford or Harvard and is a distinction that will make me highly employable.  My bullheaded drive and imagination have propelled me forward and I'm confident in my future.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>To acheive my educational goal, I need:</strong></p>
<p>As an international student at CSM, tuition for my first year of a three year degree program is $19,950 per year, not including housing, fees and travel costs. I need to raise $30,000 to meet my funding requirements:</p>
<p>·<strong>$19,950</strong> = cost of tuition</p>
<p>·<strong>$1,500</strong> = international student fees (for a student visa and health coverage from the school)</p>
<p>·<strong>$8,600</strong> = student housing </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Total cost = $19,950 + $1,500 + $8,600 = $30,000</strong></p>
<p>            Because I am an international student at CSM, tuition is must more costly than if I could study in Canada or if I had EU citizenship. Also, student loan interest rates will incur a factor of double the cost of school fees (if I borrow $30,000, I will actually be in debt for $60,000 Yikes!) so instead I am looking for private and corporate sponsors. After applying for scholarships and grants, I saved $6,000 and put down my deposit for school, ordered my textbooks and bought my plane tickets. To raise money, I have done bottle drives, alterations, raffles as well as continuing to make custom clothing and evening wear. I am driven to meet my funding goal and am unafraid but aware of the hard work involved. I am going to get my degree from Central Saint Martins and be a great designer--my one presenting obstacle is financial need. </p>
<p>            If I don't meet my total fundraising goal, the money will still be paying for school, but I will be able to take out a smaller student loan. I am happy to live on rice and beans if I'm studying at CSM! If I surpass my goal, the money will go towards paying for my second year of the three year degree program. Thank you so much in advance for your generosity and belief in my vision.</p>

<p class=""p1""><b>Our Story</b></p>
<p class=""p2"">Hello everyone,  My name is Jeff Jordan and with my co-worker Joseph Kelley, we are the creators of  ""The Perfect Wastebasket."" We created this product after Joseph  had been frustrated trying to find a wastebasket that  even moderately blended with his guest bath decor. Together we have designed a simple system that both hides the plastic bag and is easily customized to match or contrast literally any room's decor. Simply put, we have taken the lowly wastebasket and turned it into a design element instead of an eyesore. We are also currently designing a toothbrush holder and tissue dispenser with similar features. In other words we are giving your room a custom accessory makeover limited only by your imagination.</p>
<p class=""p3""><br/></p>
<p class=""p2"">During our research and development of the product, we have had overwhelming positive response from all lookers, both male and female, from interior decorators who love the design element to sports fans who can change teams or sports designs any time they want. The possibilities are literally endless, from kids' room themes (Trains or Unicorns, perhaps?), vacation pictures, matching paint, a wallpaper remnant (Jeff's favorite), or even a high-fidelity monogram! We are going to include some card stock inserts for painting or customizing. We also will be hosting contests for the most creative use of The Perfect Wastebasket. Since it really is a ""blank slate"" Jeff's son (an APPLE FANATIC!) printed a cool APPLE logo and now has a unique themed wastebasket instead of an ugly one, and you can't see the bag.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My name is Lix Hewett and I'm a 23-year-old woman from Ciudad Real, Spain. I'm a fine art photographer and dabble in a number of other arts, some with more success than others. I've been interested in fashion design since I was a teenager, and this year I finally found the courage to teach myself how to sew. In April, it occurred to me that I could combine my two passions - photography and fashion - by designing and making clothing and accessories with fabric printed with my original photography. After some research, I found <a href=""http://spoonflower.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Spoonflower"">Spoonflower</a>, which allows you to design your own custom fabric and have it printed and sent to you. It's great, and it's affordable - or it would be if I had a source of income.</p>
<p><br/>However, both my parents are unemployed, we're barely getting by on my mom's benefits, which run out in September, and finding work in my country without greatly exacerbating my social anxiety is - well, difficult. Having <a href=""http://lixhewettphotography.etsy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Lix Hewett Photography"">an Etsy shop</a> has allowed me to gain some experience as a photographer and given me a venue to share my ideas, but it doesn't bring in enough money to make a single clothing item to show off and sell, let alone a full collection. To make things even harder, my laptop - which I need to design the fabric - is six years old, slow, noisy, and quick to overheat and shut down. I can hardly edit my photographs for printing on paper; creating the more complicated designs for my fabric, especially for larger pieces like dresses, on it would be impossible.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Campaign Goal</h2>
<p>I would like to raise enough funds to:</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Buy a new MacBook Pro</h3>
<p>This will allow me to create fabric print designs, patterns, and sketches, as well as edit product photography, do graphic design, market and sell my work online.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Create a small collection of clothing and accessories</h3>
<p>This will allow me to get my ideas made, photographed and available for sale online. The funds for the collection break down as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fabric from Spoonflower printed with my designs</li>
<li>Fabric for lining &amp; fusible interfacing</li>
<li>Thread, zippers, buttons, elastic and other supplies</li>
</ol><p> </p>
<h2>The Collection</h2>
<p>I have so many ideas we'd be here forever if I laid them all out, and it would take a lot more than $600 to get them all made. Because of that, I am going to be focusing on two things for my first collection: my favorite clothing ideas, and the various little things that don't require as much money or as many supplies to make.</p>
<h3>The Little Things</h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://aclassicnotion.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/img_7204.png"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://aclassicnotion.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/img_7336.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Phone and tablet sleeves and padded covers</li>
<li>Coin purses, zipper pouches, cosmetics bags and pencil cases</li>
<li>Business card holders</li>
<li>Pillow covers and lavender sachets</li>
</ol><p>Few of these require more than a fat quarter of fabric to make, and they're simple designs, which means I can make them in just about any print. I would like to make a few of each to show, and allow potential customers to pick other prints if they wish. If any contributors claim the above as rewards, their items - with their choice of print - will be the ones going up in the shop. I will fill out my portfolio by making more of the above with leftover fabric from the rest of the collection.</p>

Store credit for $5 and above contributions, to be used on any items offered in my Etsy shop by December 31, 2013. That means if you can't afford a reward right now but want one, or don't want to decide until you see what I have to offer, you can contribute now and get your donation in store credit. To use the credit, you'll only have to contact me (via Etsy convo or e-mail), and I'll set up a custom listing for you!
Graphic design for blogs and Etsy shops - something I love to do but hardly ever can on my awfully slow laptop.
A pincushion! Cute, right?
 
Spreading the Word
If you can't contribute much, or at all right now, but would like to support me in some way, that's okay! I can absolutely understand not having money to spare. I would be enormously grateful if you simply spread the word about my campaign by sharing it on your social media sites, on your blog, with your friends, anywhere you can. Refer enough people to me, and who knows - you may just get a reward. ;)

<p>----</p></figure></div>When we started Fortress, we developed a new garment insulation for cold weather clothing. <p>For the past four years we have focused on the industrial worker; men and women who have to work in extreme cold weather (down to -40°F). So, our entire focus was on function, keeping people warm and it worked and continues to work very well!</p>
<p>But what about you, those of you who don't live and work in <b><i>extreme</i></b> cold conditions? How could you take advantage of this awesome technology without thinking that you had to be in sub-zero conditions to enjoy it?</p>
<p>Well, now you can! We've scaled back our technology (really reigned it in!). We made it thinner, lighter, and more versatile to create an everyday, light-weight, insulated hoodie that will keep you comfortable and warm throughout an incredible temperature range!</p>
<p>Watch the video below as we test the Hybrid Hoodie in the prototype stage in extreme conditions.</p>

<p>From the experience of our beta testers and our own experience we found that most people can wear this hoodie comfortably across a nearly 70 degree temperature range. The results were different for each person because not everyone experiences cold in the same way.  And these were the primary factors: </p>
<ul>
<li>Hydration Level,</li>
<li>Body Type, and</li>
<li>Your Activity Level</li>
</ul>

<p>There are three principles at the forefront of why our system works so well: </p>

</ul>

<p> </p></figure></div>
<p><b>1 - Stop the Wind</b></p>
<p>Wind can be your enemy.  If allowed to, it can suck that warm, yummy heat away from you leaving you shivering and miserable.</p>
<p>The outer fabric we use is tightly woven to be wind resistant, allowing that heat you've spent energy creating to stay with you and keep you warm.</p>

<p> </p></figure></div>
<p><b>2 - Retain Body Heat</b></p>
<p>Our proprietary insulation was created to retain its architectural structure (even when wet) maintaining the dead air space that make insulation work. This is our SECRET SAUCE!</p>
<div data-id=""13346819""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1472580208/kjhy02hna5daupik1lri.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p></figure></div>
<p><b>3 - Evacuate Moisture (sweat)</b></p>
<p>We take advantage of the second law of thermodynamics which states:</p>
<p>""When two initially isolated systems in separate but nearby regions of space, each in thermodynamic equilibrium with itself but not necessarily with each other, are then allowed to interact, they will eventually reach a mutual thermodynamic equilibrium. The sum of the entropies of the initially isolated systems is less than or equal to the total entropy of the final combination. Equality occurs just when the two original systems have all their respective intensive variables (temperature, pressure) equal; then the final system also has the same values.""</p>
<p>Simply stated, ""Moisture moves out of the clothing, as long as it's not obstructed"".</p>
<p>Because your body is continually producing heat, there is a constant flow or current from your body to the outside environment (assuming the outside environment is colder and drier).  This flow carries moisture away from your body.</p>
<p>Most other insulation materials used in cold weather clothing collect moisture, reducing the ability of the insulation to do it's job effectively, and is covered by a waterproof layer.</p>
<p>Our insulation, because of its structure, creates a clear path for moisture evacuation without buildup while retaining your body's heat.</p>
<p>By taking advantage of and working with these three critical principles, we are able to do what you see in these videos with nothing more than our own body heat.</p>

<p>So, why would we do a crowdfunding campaign for this product? </p>
<p>Traditionally, companies invest large amounts of capital ($$) doing research, building inventory, and then marketing the product. We are not traditional, as you can tell from our products. And crowdfunding is still a fairly non-traditional means of producing a product. This campaign is a way for us to target and determine the market demand for colors and sizes with our new model.</p>
<p>You tell us what that demand is by selecting a pledge, answering the after campaign survey,<i> and spreading the word through your circles of influence</i> so they can help us, too!  In return we offer this amazing product to you at a great price.</p>

By taking advantage of and working with these three critical principles, we are able to do what you see in these videos with nothing more than our own body heat.

 
GAME CHANGER!!
The purpose of these ice plunges is to demonstrate that our technology can handle even complete saturation (should you actually sweat that much!).

 

So, why would we do a crowdfunding campaign for this product? 
Traditionally, companies invest large amounts of capital ($$) doing research, building inventory, and then marketing the product. We are not traditional, as you can tell from our products. And crowdfunding is still a fairly non-traditional means of producing a product. This campaign is a way for us to target and determine the market demand for colors and sizes with our new model.
You tell us what that demand is by selecting a pledge, answering the after campaign survey, and spreading the word through your circles of influence so they can help us, too!  In return we offer this amazing product to you at a great price.


 

 

 



Production and Fulfillment are ongoing.  Because we started out in KickStarter, we have an obligation to deliver to them first, then Hoodies ordered here on IGG will begin shipping.  Our current timeline is, KS Backers ship December - January, IGG Backers ship January - February.  We will keep everyone updated about any deviation from this timeline. 

We were established as a business, in November of 2011 with a focus on industrial workers (Mining, Oil/Gas, Logging, Construction, etc.) in cold weather environments.  We continue to sell the Fortress mid-layer garments to these markets.

We've taken every possible measure to ensure that we are able to deliver a high quality product at a great price point. </p><p>As experienced communicators, clear, concise communication is of the utmost importance to us. That said, we'll try our best to address every concern, you, our dear backer may have. Should any issue arise during the production process, we assure you that we will do our best to solve those issues in a timely manner. We do not take lightly the trust you have bestowed us by becoming a WLLT backer. As such, we will keep you informed throughout the whole process, right up to delivery. </p><p>As of now, we believe that we have crossed our t's and dotted our i's.

No point creating a fantastic product only to have it get lost in the mail. To ensure every WLLT reaches its rightful owner, we've decided to go with an internationally-recognized logistics provider - DHL, so you can rest assured in a truly trusted and reputable name.</p><p>*<strong>FOC shipping for Malaysian addresses</strong><br/>We will be absorbing the shipping and logistics charges for WLLT sent to Malaysian addresses.

When we go full retail, we plan to make WLLT available in more colours and fabric options. </p><p> </p><p>• <strong>Where is WLLT manufactured?</strong></p><p>WLLT is designed and manufactured entirely in Penang, Malaysia with quality components sourced locally and internationally. </p><p> </p><p>• <strong>Does WLLT fit all kinds of bills?</strong></p><p>WLLT will fit notes up to 7 cm tall and 18 cm wide. </p><p> </p><p>• <strong>How many cards can fit in WLLT?</strong></p><p>Because of the elastic band that wraps around WLLT, we find that up to 8 cards fit snugly. Again, because of the elastic properties of the band, users could always squeeze more cards in. </p><p> </p><p>• <strong>What is the colour accuracy of the leather? </strong></p><p>Our leather supplier assures us that they will try to ensure the colour accuracy of all their products. However, they have told us that it is impossible to make sure that every order of leather will be 100% the same. Except for black, all other colours may have a small percentage of colour variance. </p><p> </p><p>• <strong>How much is the expected retail price of WLLT?</strong></p><p>Currently, we expect to market WLLT exclusively through our online store at USD 80 per unit. </p><p> </p><p>• <strong>Can I choose multiple delivery addresses if I am buying more than one?</strong></p><p>Yes, we are able to accept multiple mailing addresses for backers who pledge more than one unit. However, do note that the delivery/logistic charges will be according to the delivery/shipping address. For instance, if a backer orders two WLLT with shipping addresses in the United States and Singapore, then the shipping charges will correspond with the shipping to both the United States and Singapore. </p><p> </p><p>• <strong>How does the RFID work?</strong></p><p>By nature, The Core which is made of aluminum is RFID resistant. This quality of aluminum helps prevent unwanted security breaches where RFID scanners are used for malicious intent.  </p><p> </p><p>• <strong>Do you provide any warranty for WLLT? </strong></p><p>We do not provide any warranty for WLLT. However, every piece will go through stringent quality control before they are shipped to our backers. </p><p> </p><p>• <strong>Is cash on delivery (COD) available?</strong></p><p>Cash on delivery is not available. As this is an Indiegogo campaign, we are obliged to follow all Indiegogo requirements and regulations throughout the campaign. This includes payment modes and methods.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532493280/sicx9wdk0ofvmsfzkm6l.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Your kind support of our vision is very much appreciated.

In a blink of an eye.    CREATIVE TEAMWe’re a bunch of advertising agency folk who have spent the last twenty years branding, positioning and marketing our clients’ services and products. We’ve always loved the challenges and have always tried to stand by the values of creativity and innovation to change human experiences. One of our ambitions was to create our own brand - one which we could hold dear, care for and nurture over time. After over a year of research, brainstorming and prototypes, we’re pleased to announce the birth of WLLT.   BE PART OF OUR STORYCalling all creatives, artists and designers!!! Let's collaborate and make something wonderful. Get in touch with us to find out how you can be a part of WLLT and even get paid for your contributions. Follow our journey: CONTACT USIf you have any queries, please don't hesitate to reach us at urwllt@gmail.com RISKS AND CHALLENGES We have spent the better part of a year researching the various materials needed to turn WLLT into a reality. We've also spent a lot of time working with our manufacturing partners to make sure the desired results are achievable. We've taken every possible measure to ensure that we are able to deliver a high quality product at a great price point. As experienced communicators, clear, concise communication is of the utmost importance to us. That said, we'll try our best to address every concern, you, our dear backer may have. Should any issue arise during the production process, we assure you that we will do our best to solve those issues in a timely manner. We do not take lightly the trust you have bestowed us by becoming a WLLT backer. As such, we will keep you informed throughout the whole process, right up to delivery. As of now, we believe that we have crossed our t's and dotted our i's. Our manufacturing partners assure us that they are well prepared to handle our orders so we do not foresee any major issue forthcoming. Thank you for your trust and faith in us and we look forward to your support in our campaign. SHIPPING It's our first campaign ever so we must get things right. No point creating a fantastic product only to have it get lost in the mail. To ensure every WLLT reaches its rightful owner, we've decided to go with an internationally-recognized logistics provider - DHL, so you can rest assured in a truly trusted and reputable name.*FOC shipping for Malaysian addressesWe will be absorbing the shipping and logistics charges for WLLT sent to Malaysian addresses. WLLT will be sent using either a local logistics company or Pos Laju.*Please keep in mind that import fees or any other carrier fees are not included. Depending on your country's custom's regulations, you will have to pay for them upon arrival. FAQ • What colours are available?Currently, WLLT is available in Black (Urban Mantra) and Dark Brown (City Ballistic). When we go full retail, we plan to make WLLT available in more colours and fabric options.  • Where is WLLT manufactured?WLLT is designed and manufactured entirely in Penang, Malaysia with quality components sourced locally and internationally.  • Does WLLT fit all kinds of bills?WLLT will fit notes up to 7 cm tall and 18 cm wide.  • How many cards can fit in WLLT?Because of the elastic band that wraps around WLLT, we find that up to 8 cards fit snugly. Again, because of the elastic properties of the band, users could always squeeze more cards in.  • What is the colour accuracy of the leather? Our leather supplier assures us that they will try to ensure the colour accuracy of all their products. However, they have told us that it is impossible to make sure that every order of leather will be 100% the same. Except for black, all other colours may have a small percentage of colour variance.  • How much is the expected retail price of WLLT?Currently, we expect to market WLLT exclusively through our online store at USD 80 per unit.  • Can I choose multiple delivery addresses if I am buying more than one?Yes, we are able to accept multiple mailing addresses for backers who pledge more than one unit. However, do note that the delivery/logistic charges will be according to the delivery/shipping address. For instance, if a backer orders two WLLT with shipping addresses in the United States and Singapore, then the shipping charges will correspond with the shipping to both the United States and Singapore.  • How does the RFID work?By nature, The Core which is made of aluminum is RFID resistant. This quality of aluminum helps prevent unwanted security breaches where RFID scanners are used for malicious intent.   • Do you provide any warranty for WLLT? We do not provide any warranty for WLLT. However, every piece will go through stringent quality control before they are shipped to our backers.  • Is cash on delivery (COD) available?Cash on delivery is not available. As this is an Indiegogo campaign, we are obliged to follow all Indiegogo requirements and regulations throughout the campaign. This includes payment modes and methods. Your kind support of our vision is very much appreciated. It is people like yourself who has given creators a chance to share our ideas with the world. Thank you for your trust and may God bless you always.",41.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>We are trustworthy.</strong> RPG Crossing is a welcoming community run by gamers for gamers that has dealt fairly with its community members for over a decade. We aren't going anywhere, and we will deliver. To quote one of our members, ""I have been an active member here since 2004. I've trusted them with my personal information and have had no issues. I have voluntarily given them money so they can continue to exist because the site is that good."" (source: Web of Trust review)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We're Aiming For</h3>
<p>Goal: $1000 — enough that we can get some quantity discounts and break even on the shirts.</p>
<p>We'd love to make a startlingly large donation to the BBR Foundation and introduce some new folks to our community along the way.</p>
<p>Net revenue, if any, on this venture will go to the RPG Crossing Community. The community has aging architecture and is badly in help of more time than its volunteer maintainers can provide. We would dearly love to have a cash reserve to be able to move forward with some critical infrastructure projects and move the site into the 21st century.</p>
<h3><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>You have <strong>options</strong>, but no matter what you choose <strong>every pledge will support mental health research</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>OPTION 1: Shirts!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> Gildan 100% cotton t-shirts</li>
<li>These are the same shirts we have used previously, and they have held up perfectly after years of washes</li>
<li>This is the same printer we have used previously, and their work has likewise stood up perfectly for years (Armadillo Printwear); if we end up with a lot of Canadian orders we may also print shirts in Canada rather than ship them North, but if we do, the quality will not be compromised</li>
<li>The shirts will have the custom Ork Glyph artwork on the front, and an RPG Crossing logo on the back across the shoulders.</li>
<li>If you need a shirt size that is not listed as an option, please contact us!</li>
<li>Delivery is expected to be the end of February.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>OPTION 2: Membership to RPG Crossing (part of the Gamer Bundle)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A one-year membership to RPG Crossing  normally costs $25. These are the primary way the site pays its bills.</li>
<li>The gamer bundle includes a $5 discount on the membership PLUS the RPG Crossing donates $5 to charity (RPG Crossing takes in $15 minus fees instead of the normal $25.)</li>
<li>Note:  you do not need a membership to participate in the community. Give <a href=""http://www.rpgcrossing.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RPG Crossing</a> a spin for free (forever, if you like); a good way to start is by making a thread in the <a href=""https://www.rpgcrossing.com/forumdisplay.php?f=861"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">new members section</a>
</li>
<li>Delivery is within 3 days of provision of a username on the site.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>OPTION 3: Personalized Ork Art</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our artist has shown me so many awesome and hilarious sketches at this point. If you grab this opportunity, you will send Darren a photo of an individual and he will produce an Orkified version! See what he's done to his own children (terrible!):<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480565777/vtmh1new778wj1cnurcc.png"" src="""" style=""""/>
</li>
<li>Also, because of the good cause and the community, the artist is donating his work, but he will receive half of all proceeds from the personalized Ork art. Support our artist! We want him to want to do this again!</li>
<li>Delivery is expected before the end of January, but may be much earlier (especially the digital scans.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>OPTION 4: ""The Spirit of Snowman Vengeance"" postcards</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481254461/wlwthyyryybpeyb2zbjj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>

If you are waiting for an order that includes a black Toolcard we should be shipping those out the week of Oct. 23.  Thank you for your support and we hope to see you at LeverGear.com.-The Lever Gear TeamThe Lever Gear Toolcard packs 40 tools into a one ounce, credit card-sized multitool. It fits in your wallet, or it can be your wallet. Either way, it’s always with you so you can get things done. Your to-do list won't stand a chance. The Toolcard is built for people who demand quality tools and like to be prepared to handle everyday tasks as they arise. It's the perfect gift for gear lovers, designers, makers, hikers, homeowners, and anyone who likes cool tools. 
Made in America from blade quality 420 Stainless Steel
TSA compliant and slim enough to take anywhere
Beautifully finished in silver or black with laser marked graphics
40 Tools to handle countless jobs
Snap-on clip converts wallet card to money clip
In short, it's simply the best multitool you can fit in your wallet. Don't just take our word for it...    As well as... GearHungry, TheGadgetflow, BroBible, and more coming soon. .    The Toolcard is packed with tools including:8 metric wrenches (5mm - 15mm); 8 inch wrenches (3/16” - 9/16”); 8 open-end wrenches fitting: metric nuts 7,8,10,11,13mm inch nuts #4,#6,#8,#10,¼”,5/16”; Bottle opener; Can opener; Cord cutter; Large flat/Phillips screwdriver; Small flathead screwdriver; Small Phillips screwdriver; Metric ruler (8cm); Inch ruler (3in); Straight edge/scraper;  ¼” Hex bit holder; Pry tool with nail puller; Protractor; 30°, 45°, 60°, 90° speed square; Circle drawing template; Money clip.The Toolcard may have 40 tools, but the uses are endless. Here are a few ideas:Turn stuff... like large and small flat head and Phillips head screws, metric nuts and bolts, unified nuts and bolts, and any standard 1/4"" bit driver.Pry stuff... like staples, small nails, paint can lids, the last few semi-open pistachios in the bowl.Open stuff... bottles, food cans, boxes (even the ones with that annoying stringy tape). Did we mention bottles? The bottle opener is front and center and works like a charm.Measure stuff... in millimeters or inches. Measure angles with the protractor or speed square. And draw stuff... like perfect circles, precise angles and straight lines. And cut stuff... like P cord, twine, clothing tags. The cord cutter is protected so it will cut cords, but not your fingers. It can even sharpen a pencil.The Toolcard is just 1.5mm thick and slightly smaller than a credit card. Weighing only 1 ounce, you won't even notice it until you need it. The cord cutter blade is concealed inside the can opener recess so it's TSA compliant and won't cut your wallet.For those times when a wallet is just too thick, get minimal with the most useful money clip around. Each Toolcard comes with a removable money clip that holds up to six cards or a wad of cash. It snaps on or off in seconds with no tools required and no fasteners to lose. And the best part… the bottle opener works with your credit cards in place.With the perfect blend of style and function, the Toolcard is designed to look great with your other gear and still be the hardest working card-sized tool on the market.The Toolcard has the attention to detail you demand from the objects you carry. The chamfered edges add visual depth to the flat form. The bead blast finish in silver or gun metal black creates a beautiful, satin sheen and the laser etching adds sharp, permanent markings that are easy to read and look great.When the campaign ends, you'll have the option to specify Satin Stainless or Gun Metal Black. If you order more than one, you can specify how many of each color you would like. Please note: You don't need to specify your color when you pledge. We will send you a survey within a few weeks of your pledge and before we ship your order to get your color information and any other information we need including the personalisation option below. Logo courtesy of Fort Capital Resources, Inc.The Toolcard makes a great gift. Create a personal touch by adding initials or a special message. It's also great as a company gift to thank valued employees or reward important customers with a product that demonstrates the same commitment to excellence as your company. To have a custom inscription laser marked onto your Toolcard, select the $39 Personalized Toolcard reward level. Add $39 for each additional card you would like to customize. When the campaign ends we will send you a survey with an area to submit your text and select a font. Due to size constraints, we recommend a maximum of 3 lines of text with 20 characters max per line.To have your company logo laser marked on 10 Toolcards, select the $350 logo 10-pack reward level.  After the campaign we will contact you to get your logo in .jpeg, .png, .ai or .eps format. Keep in mind that the maximum dimensions are 24mm wide by 10mm tall.

<h2><em>Everyone is an Icon to Someone...</em></h2>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Sabrina Diana and I have always wanted to open a women's clothing boutique that was both affordable and trendy.  I am one who loves fashion but is on a budget, and there is nothing wrong with that.  When I was a student at Rutgers University in New Jersey, there were no clothing stores that we could rely on for trendy clothes, and the school had about 24,000 full-time female students.  You can imagine the need.  I want to open a clothing boutique that doesn't make you feel guilty when purchasing your favorite items because a part of the profits will go to an orphanage in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The western-styled clothes will be manufactured in Bangladesh (the motherland) and the designs will be exclusive.  Each design will only have nine pieces (three in every size) to capture the exclusivity of the design and share some sense of individuality for the woman.  It will make the woman feel good about herself and feel good about making the purchase.  </p>
<p> </p>

</ul>
<p>DISCLAIMER: If by any chance I do not raise the initial capital, the funds will go into a high-interest savings account (ING) until I can accommodate the difference for the start-up costs.  The 10% donation out of the final funds raised will still be donated to the orphanage in January. Icons Boutique will also start as an online store. </p>

<p>To me, this is my lifetime dream.  I have planned this out so strategically that I have analyzed all the risks involved, but aside from that is the importance of accomplishing your dreams.  I believe that this is going to work with no doubt.  Do you?</p>

$50 screams a canvas bag! Your investment will include a canvas bag that has the boutique's logo including all the fun perks above. If you bring that bag during your shopping spree, you get an extra discount for being ""green""!!!
For the grand opening-fashion show extravaganza, you will receive two VIP admissions which includes frontal seating and a gift bag for each. By investing $100, aside from everything else, you will have two VIP tickets to one of the six parties.

By investing $250, you will be known as a official donor and will be listed on a plaque which will be staged at the orphanage. It's a great honor to have you contribute, thus the world should take notice. Another way to take notice is by wearing a fabulous outfit purchased a 10% off coupon!

Invest $500, and you will receive two additional VIP tickets and $25 gift card to the store! Nothing feels better than feeling important... like an Icon.
Lastly, an $1,000 investment will get you an intimate dinner for four on me, the eccentric owner at my favorite restaurant in New Brunwsick! Can't wait to meet you!

DISCLAIMER: If by any chance I do not raise the initial capital, the funds will go into a high-interest savings account (ING) until I can accommodate the difference for the start-up costs.  The 10% donation out of the final funds raised will still be donated to the orphanage in January. Icons Boutique will also start as an online store. 


The Impact
You have the chance to make a great impact in today's society. 

You are helping a third-world country (Bangladesh) and its orphans.
New Brunswick, NJ is one of the cities listed as a part of the Urban Renewal Mission for New Jersey.
It helps small businesses!  As a local business, you will be able to promote small businesses in a city and for the US economy. 
Create jobs for the surrounding areas.
Encourage women empowerment by helping a woman entreprenuer and business owner.  Also, by recoginizing the theme of the store, ""Everyone is an Icon to Someone"".

The basis of this boutique is to be more than just a store with trendy clothes. This boutique is a solution to a cause.  It touches upon many philanthropic aspects all by the means of fashion!
To me, this is my lifetime dream.  I have planned this out so strategically that I have analyzed all the risks involved, but aside from that is the importance of accomplishing your dreams.  I believe that this is going to work with no doubt.  Do you?
 
Other Ways You Can Help


If you can't contribute, no harm, no foul, but I ask you spread the word about this righteous business cause. It's more than a clothing store, it is a way to change the world.  
Also--remember that anything is possible as long as you put your mind to it.  If you ask anyone, that's literally what I do.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I was along the Nile River when I saw a small boy carrying a large gas container full of Nile water. The boy was shy, but he soon warmed up after exchanging some funny faces. After a low-five the boy was running off with a T-shirt I gave him and the container of water. But, for the rest of my time in Africa I couldn't get it out of my head that my new friend was about to drink water out of the Nile.</p><p>Everyone has moments in their life that change them; that little boy changed my life. It set me on a path to try and give back. Now I have a wonderful team around me that all strive to change the world and create a high quality product that we can all be proud of.

I was along the Nile River when I saw a small boy carrying a large gas container full of Nile water. The boy was shy, but he soon warmed up after exchanging some funny faces. After a low-five the boy was running off with a T-shirt I gave him and the container of water. But, for the rest of my time in Africa I couldn't get it out of my head that my new friend was about to drink water out of the Nile.Everyone has moments in their life that change them; that little boy changed my life. It set me on a path to try and give back. Now I have a wonderful team around me that all strive to change the world and create a high quality product that we can all be proud of. From our Creative Director Nikol and our first designer Nastassia to our interns Avra, Kelsey, and Noelle we have had great people working on making you look good while we all make a huge impact.We have worked long nights for the past 10 months and are so proud to have an excellent product, a great partnership with Drop in the Bucket, and we are ready to make a difference.

<p></p></span></span></span><p>We're a movement that believes good is a cycle, and most companies only go half circle.
We want to source goods that are ethically sound, produced with minimal
environmental impact, and that help local economies. In turn, we want to donate
part of the proceeds from these goods to smaller and local organizations trying
to create change. We believe that by taking time to find small organizations
looking to create change, partnering with them to help them achieve their
goal, and creating a community of individuals powered by doing good, we can
change the world. We want you to be able to submit local organizations creating
change, and we want to connect you with the impact your support had on the
organizations later.</p>
<p>Our model
has three parts:</p>
<p>1.)<span>  </span>Find great, ethically produced, items from
small businesses around the world. By supporting small businesses in developing
parts of the world we can boost those economies, create jobs, and help lift
citizens out of poverty.</p>
<p>2.)<span>  </span>Give back with every purchase. We’re not
going to just market our goods with a charity. We’re going to search to find
the real change-makers, wherever they may be, and make sure they have the
funding they need to make the world a better place.</p>
<p>3.)<span>  </span>Create a community. We don’t want to just
sell products; we want to create connections. We want the organizations we
support to be able to tell you their story, and we want you to know the impact
the money we raised had on their organization. We want to hear about the
change-makers you know, and what we can do to help them out.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Every
day, 27 non-profit organizations go out of business while .0083% of
non-profits receive 1/8th of private donations. 100 non-profits get 1/8th of
the pie, while the other 1.2 million split the rest, and the funding per
organization gets minuscule as the list goes down. This is largely
driven by the notoriety given to certain organizations through
partnerships with powerful brands, while small, local, innovative groups
struggle to find the funding to push forward. </p>
<p>We’re
sick of it. Many of these powerful brands use unethical labor practices, cause
extreme environmental harm, and even sell toxic products while hiding under the
their charitable partnerships. </p>
<p>We
don’t think it’s okay to say you want to help poverty while doing nothing to increase
economic activity if you have the resources. Letting someone use their skills
to earn a fair wage is a much more effective way to break the cycle of poverty.</p>
<p>We
don’t think it’s okay to overprice poorly made products in the name of
bettering the world while barely donating to the cause.</p>
<p>We
don’t think it’s okay to sell products with carcinogens while supporting cancer
awareness.</p>
<p>We
do believe that every action can be for good, and that’s the principle we’ve
built our supply chain around.</p>

<p></p>
<p>We know what we’re doing, and we know how to do it.
We've set up connections with local artisans and groups in several different cities, and we're ready to move forward with completing our supply chain. We just need funding to get there. </p>
<p>Right now, our goal is to import products from the Bosh Bosh Project, because we feel they embody everything our company wants to achieve. By teaching girls a skill they can use to support themselves, and using the money to keep them in school, they're empowering women to break the cycle of poverty. Importing products from Liberia is complicated and costly though, and we don't have the funding to do this without your help!</p>

<p>For our perks, we don't want to list specific products we're importing, because the exact color/style combinations are uncertain. Many groups, and in particular the Bosh Bosh Project, use the local fabrics and scraps available to come up with their designs so we can't guarantee a particular color available in a particular style until we get the funding to bring them in. However, you can buy a gift card worth 1.25x it's purchase price to use on these products on our official launch! In addition, we have these great perks<br/><br/></p>

<p>We wanted to create something special for our backers, so this design will only be available during our campaign. The first 50 backers will be able to receive it in t-shirt form for only $25, along with everything included in our change-maker package, AND you will receive it in time for the holidays! After the first 50 have been claimed, you will still be able to get the design by specifying it in the dreamer package, but they won't ship out until January. </p>
<p>Every $500 we raise will unlock a new design choice, and we will e-mail you a survey at the end of the campaign to let you choose! Designs that have already been unlocked are available in the gallery. Sizes available are XS-XL.</p>
<p>Creating change is important to us, so even during the campaign $5 from every pledge that purchases a product will go our featured organizations, which you can readabout below.</p>
<p>*International shipping is available, just add $30!</p>
<h4>Manufacturing</h4>
<p>We want our impact on the world to be positive. All our perk items use low-impact dyes. This means they do not contain heavy metals or toxic substances, nor are they petro-chemically based. The absorption (or fixation) rate for these dyes averages 75%, which means less dye is used to produce our colors and less water is used to rinse them in the process. For fabrics, we use innovative eco-friendly offerings, knitting organic cotton with recycled polyester and rayon to create an incredibly comfortable product.</p>
<p>The ink we print with is free of most environmentally damaging chemicals such as PVC, phthalate, heavy metals, azo compounds, nonylphenol and formaldehyde. We screen print every shirt by hand, which gives them a unique feel, and keeps us from having electrical equipment running constantly.</p>

<p>Kitechild is transforming the quality of care for orphan and vulnerable children through sustainable micro-projects. Once co-founder <strong>Jacqueline Herrera </strong>was able to see first hand how these children lived and meet them and see that they are wonderful, normal children who love to sing, play, dance just like every other child, she knew that the world needed to know about them and stop seeing orphans as hopeless causes. They are children full of potential and if we do not help them, they will continue the cycles of poverty, abuse, and violence that often led them to live in orphanages in the first place.</p>
<p>Our model is project based, which means we partner with select orphanages and assess the children's living conditions and see where there is a need. Needs include food security, quality of nutrition, access to education, and appropriate caregivers. Examples of projects to address these needs are chicken coops, greenhouses, fish farms, solar panel installation, etc. All projects are sustainable and have a direct impact on each child's quality of life. The projects also help the homes become less dependent on foreign aid, and they are able to devote more time to caring for each child. </p>
<p>The money we're raising will help with four projects they have on deck. One is solar panels in Liberia that will save the home $450 per month they currently spend on generator fuel. The money saved will allow the home to feed the children three times a day as opposed to two. Other projects coming up are a school at an orphanage in India, a chicken farm in India, and clean water access in Kenya. They also need funding to cover administrative costs such as paying our liaisons who monitor each project in the field.    </p>

Members of the Bosh Bosh Project, an organization that teaches girls sewing skills and uses their products to fund their school tuition. We want to carry these products in the U.S.! 



We're a movement that believes good is a cycle, and most companies only go half circle.
We want to source goods that are ethically sound, produced with minimal
environmental impact, and that help local economies. In turn, we want to donate
part of the proceeds from these goods to smaller and local organizations trying
to create change. We believe that by taking time to find small organizations
looking to create change, partnering with them to help them achieve their
goal, and creating a community of individuals powered by doing good, we can
change the world. We want you to be able to submit local organizations creating
change, and we want to connect you with the impact your support had on the
organizations later.
Our model
has three parts:
1.)  Find great, ethically produced, items from
small businesses around the world. By supporting small businesses in developing
parts of the world we can boost those economies, create jobs, and help lift
citizens out of poverty.
2.)  Give back with every purchase. We’re not
going to just market our goods with a charity. We’re going to search to find
the real change-makers, wherever they may be, and make sure they have the
funding they need to make the world a better place.
3.)  Create a community. We don’t want to just
sell products; we want to create connections. We want the organizations we
support to be able to tell you their story, and we want you to know the impact
the money we raised had on their organization. We want to hear about the
change-makers you know, and what we can do to help them out.










Every
day, 27 non-profit organizations go out of business while .0083% of
non-profits receive 1/8th of private donations. 100 non-profits get 1/8th of
the pie, while the other 1.2 million split the rest, and the funding per
organization gets minuscule as the list goes down. This is largely
driven by the notoriety given to certain organizations through
partnerships with powerful brands, while small, local, innovative groups
struggle to find the funding to push forward. 
We’re
sick of it. Many of these powerful brands use unethical labor practices, cause
extreme environmental harm, and even sell toxic products while hiding under the
their charitable partnerships. 
We
don’t think it’s okay to say you want to help poverty while doing nothing to increase
economic activity if you have the resources. Letting someone use their skills
to earn a fair wage is a much more effective way to break the cycle of poverty.
We
don’t think it’s okay to overprice poorly made products in the name of
bettering the world while barely donating to the cause.
We
don’t think it’s okay to sell products with carcinogens while supporting cancer
awareness.
We
do believe that every action can be for good, and that’s the principle we’ve
built our supply chain around.

Ghandi said, ""In a gentle way, you can shake the world.""We've taken that to heart.








We know what we’re doing, and we know how to do it.
We've set up connections with local artisans and groups in several different cities, and we're ready to move forward with completing our supply chain. We just need funding to get there. 
Right now, our goal is to import products from the Bosh Bosh Project, because we feel they embody everything our company wants to achieve. By teaching girls a skill they can use to support themselves, and using the money to keep them in school, they're empowering women to break the cycle of poverty. Importing products from Liberia is complicated and costly though, and we don't have the funding to do this without your help!










For our perks, we don't want to list specific products we're importing, because the exact color/style combinations are uncertain. Many groups, and in particular the Bosh Bosh Project, use the local fabrics and scraps available to come up with their designs so we can't guarantee a particular color available in a particular style until we get the funding to bring them in. However, you can buy a gift card worth 1.25x it's purchase price to use on these products on our official launch! In addition, we have these great perks








In most perks, you'll receive a hand-written thank you from us. We truly appreciate the support, much more than the internet can convey! 





We wanted to create something special for our backers, so this design will only be available during our campaign. The first 50 backers will be able to receive it in t-shirt form for only $25, along with everything included in our change-maker package, AND you will receive it in time for the holidays!

I had to do something bigger than myself. Making the decision to dive in, Avantika Aggarwal, a Delhi native that had been exposed to discrepancies in healthcare her entire life, and I co-founded the SHARE (Sustainable Healthcare Alliance for Recycled Equipment) enterprise. Above: birthing table in a hospital in Cameroon.The Product
While the primary mission of SHARE Scrubs is to provide access to healthcare for all and bring awareness to global health issues around the world, we do not skimp on product quality. We realize that the professionals sporting our scrubs deserve the best, and we have every intention to give them the best. SHARE Scrubs are made with a soft cotton/polyester/spandex blend and incorporate convenient pockets with special spaces for pens and such things as gauze and bandaids.The breast pocket is adorned with a pocket flap (to keep valuables, such as a wedding ring, secured in the pocket) made from traditional fabric sourced from each country that we are aiding, adding a unique and fashionable flare to each scrub top, and allowing each scrub wearer to become an identifiable ambassador for healthcare development, globally.The ImpactAs a wearer of SHARE Scrubs medical apparel, you are acting as an advocate for building sustainable healthcare systems around the world. Because SHARE Scrubs donates 25% of all profits to our nonprofit sister organization, SHARE the impact you are making is great: for every $1, you are providing about $20 worth of life-saving medical supplies such as sterilization machines, x-ray machines, proper surgical tools, hospital beds, and neonatal incubators. The project is no easy feat, but together, we can assure that millions of people around the world have access to quality healthcare. What We Need The money raised from this Indiegogo campaign will allow us to start the production process. Upon receiving funds, we will be able to:1) Finalize our designs and specifications2) Order prototypes to be used for pre-orders and marketing materials3) Go into small-scale full productionEssentially, if fully funded, we will, finally, be able to launch SHARE Scrubs, kickstarting our path towards promoting and delivering better healthcare for all. Other Ways You Can HelpEvery little bit helps. Spread the word! Share this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, blogs, or even by word. Our greatest motivator is knowing that people like you believe in us.",3.0,0,"3 Campaigns

 three years ago I got in a warehouse determined to stay there until I 
produced a unique and innovative climbing hold. A few years later and 
after numerous attempts followed by (the wrong) surprises, failures and 
disappointments, it finally came the time of reward; the warehouse 
started getting full of colorful and playful objects, the IBEX climbing 
holds! I was still in the warehouse but happy and proud.</p><p>Throughout
 this process and challenge I was not alone. Many people, each through 
their own specialized field, added something to the whole picture, one 
by handling the engineering aspect, others by giving advice related to 
the production line, others by sculpting prototypes and others by giving
 business advice but all with the same genuine enthousiasm. Soon we all 
gathered under one roof, with one goal. </p><p>We now had a new big location and <b>IBEX</b> was born. <b>IBEX</b>
 is the result of many people putting their talents and devotion into 
the creation of the first company that designs and manufactures climbing

standards, a result of many years’ and money consuming research. <b>IBEX</b> has
developed a rich range
of climbing holds in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Made with dedication,
attention to detail and accuracy, the final product is of high quality in design
and technology.<br/><br/>There are <b>7 basic fields</b> that we at <b>IBEX</b> take very seriously.  These are the following:<br/><br/><b>1) DESIGN</b><br/><br/>A
 climbing hold is considered to have a successful design if it fulfills 
the rules of anatomy and at the same time it has an aesthetic innovation
 that differentiates it from other climbing holds. All prototypes of <b>IBEX</b>
 have been designed in an anatomic way in order to avoid causing 
injuries to climbers. We offer a big range of holds, including “hollow 
backs” and dual texture techniques in an extended variety of colors. The
 developed hold shapes cover the needs of any climbing wall: edges, 
pinches, pockets, slopers, footholds etc; in addition, <b>IBEX</b> has created special series, like the ‘’rock series’’ which has been designed based on real rocks.<br/>Additionally, our prototype designs are based on correct anatomy with the safety of the climber in mind. <br/><br/><b>2) WASHER</b><br/>The washer’s development has been effected in cooperation with 
specialized engineers, aiming to spread the stress efficiently and to limit the stress on isolated spots
increasing the hold’s overall strength, exhibiting 5 times the strength 
of concrete. <b>IBEX</b> aims at the long-term satisfaction of its customers.Custom made stainless steel washer for the central bolt, especially made by <b>IBEX</b>,
 in order to accommodate both countersunk and Cap Head bolts. In 
addition to that, its width allows the design of very small holds.<br/>The
 design of the washer socket system ensures that the cap of the bolt 
does not stick out so there is no risk of injury for the climber’s 
fingers and also that it does not create any indent that could affect 
the shape of the hold.<br/>The washer socket system ensures the vertical 
position of the bold towards the flat climbing wall that is necessary in
 order to avoid concentration of increased pressure power at a single 
point. <br/><br/><b>3) SAFETY</b><br/><br/>An extract from the preface of the EN 12572-3 text follows.<br/>Introduction<br/>The
 working group recognizes that there is a potential danger to ACS users 
from being struck by falling pieces of climbing holds that break whilst 
in use on an ACS. Some propriety systems within climbing holds have been
 developed by manufacturers in response to this problem but the systems 
have not been perfected and further development work is required. The 
aim is to develop a system that would prevent 'large' pieces of a broken
 hold that could cause serious injury to ACS users, from 'breaking-off' 
and falling from the ACS.<br/>Designers and manufacturers are requested to work on new systems that would address this problem.<br/>The
 regulation described in EN 12572-3 depicts in a concise way the various
 norms that have come up in time through observation but also through 
laboratory studies so compliance to such regulation should be pursued in
 order to improve the products.<br/>After experiments with the use of 
plastic and metallic grid, the casting of materials, like glass fibre 
etc. it has been proven that the best technique is the utilization of a torsion spring. The design is original, created in accordance with the dimensions that accommodate the <b>IBEX</b> climbing holds. <br/><br/><b>4) TECHNICAL DESIGN</b><br/><br/>Another
 technical issue that had to be solved was the design of the 
construction formula that defines how the hole of the wooden bold is 
embedded in the holds. <br/>At <b>IBEX</b> Climbing Holds, we follow a 
solution that solves other issues too and that ensures the vertical 
setting of the hole and the absolute contact between the bolt and the 
hold; the hole’s depth is measured with precision. This way, the 
creation of prototypes out of any material (wood, stone, plaster, clay 
etc.) is easier, giving us the possibility to design impressive holds, 
given that the companies that are active in this field insist on 
creating prototypes made of two-part expanded polystyrene. <br/><br/><b>5) MATERIALS</b><br/><br/>Mixture of polyester with fillers opaque material\ color, which creates a strong lightweight hold.<br/>The final mixture used in combination with the casting method, which is effected on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LV_m9ZRr5Ew"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">pulsating tables</a> (for the avoidance of air bubbles retention and therefore of points of reduced durability), is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNNKh4f6D9I"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">exceptionally durable</a>
 in a state of crush; laboratory tests prove durability, which is five 
times stronger than that of the foundation cement. These results are 
very satisfying, taking into consideration that if one fifth of the 
torsion force is applied on the washer, the t-nut will present points of
 wear and tear therefore it will break. Namely, the t-nut will break 
first and then the plywood will follow and still the hold will not 
present any sign of wear. This practically means that it is not required
 to have a big volume of material between the washer and the climbing 
wall, which allows the company to design small holds that are bolt owns.<br/>Polyester
 has some soft spots, mainly due to the fact that it is a particularly 
hard material, therefore easy to break with impact, with limited tensile
 strength. However, with the final mixture of quartz powder – polyester –
 liquid color, we achieve maximum strength of the hold and maximum 
endurance of the final product without any alterations due to friction.  <br/><br/><b>6) TEXTURE</b><br/><br/>Exterior texture<br/>There
 are as many opinions on the types of friction as there are climbers. A 
wall climber has a different way to deal with this matter than an 
occasional climber. The preferences of beginner and advanced climbers 
also differ. <br/>The rules in this case are not specific but they are 
sometimes set according to the type of hold (pocket, sloper etc) or its 
use (sporting events, training etc).<br/>The company’s aim is that the 
customer stays satisfied with the climbing holds in the long run and not
 only that he has a good first impression. However, since the first 
impression is also important, <b>IBEX</b> Climbing Holds has created 
series of dual texture holds that offer low or high friction, according 
to the way they are installed. <br/>Through continuous feedback, the 
company is now in a position to satisfy the most demanding climber who 
will find among the wide range of <b>IBEX</b> products the holds that meet his needs. <br/><br/><b>7) LOGO.</b><br/><br/>Last
 but not least, there is the logo issue. According to the standard EN 
12572-3 each hold longer than 5 cm should bear the logo of the company 
that produces it.<br/>In response to this issue, <b>IBEX</b> Climbing 
Holds has developed a technology of integration of the logo on its 
holds. One of the problems we had to face was to find a way to integrate
 the logo without affecting with bad friction the climber’s fingers, 
while keeping the logo recognizable and readable. At the same time, the 
logo shouldn’t have delicate and fragile parts that could break and give
 a bad image to the hold and the company.<h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/359299/files/20140209135434-DELIVERY_TIMELINE.jpg?1391982874"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/382245/files/20140220030056-delivery_graphic.jpg?1392894056"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>THIS NOT JUST ANOTHER CLIMBING HOLD COMPANY</b>.

customer stays satisfied with the climbing holds in the long run and not
 only that he has a good first impression. However, since the first 
impression is also important, IBEX Climbing Holds has created 
series of dual texture holds that offer low or high friction, according 
to the way they are installed. Through continuous feedback, the 
company is now in a position to satisfy the most demanding climber who 
will find among the wide range of IBEX products the holds that meet his needs. 7) LOGO.Last
 but not least, there is the logo issue. According to the standard EN 
12572-3 each hold longer than 5 cm should bear the logo of the company 
that produces it.In response to this issue, IBEX Climbing 
Holds has developed a technology of integration of the logo on its 
holds. One of the problems we had to face was to find a way to integrate
 the logo without affecting with bad friction the climber’s fingers, 
while keeping the logo recognizable and readable. At the same time, the 
logo shouldn’t have delicate and fragile parts that could break and give
 a bad image to the hold and the company.THIS NOT JUST ANOTHER CLIMBING HOLD COMPANY.
 It is the birth of an idea of a very determined group of people who are
 lucking into the future and want to make a difference. We have the 
motivation , the hard working built up,  the know how. Give us your vote

<h2>Campaign Description:</h2>
<p>With dark, delicious and deadly fashion being the <em><strong style=""color: #465c71;"">Raison d'être</strong></em> for most of Sparx's art, the idea of dropping sketch to fabric has forever been a desire. Sparx and Mace is now asking for your help to make this dream and more come true!</p>
<p>Goth, Manga, Anime, Yaoi, Fetish and Fantasy...  All of these are Sparx's artistic muses.   The images in this first collection were chosen because they share a common theme, that of the creator's original inspirations, and are partly an homage to years of attending Anime North.  What better way to do that, than through fan art?  The first, a romantic tribute to every anime fan's favorite Dhampir Sons of Dracula, Vampire Hunter D and Castlevania's Alucard.  Metalocalypse's Skwisgaar Skwigelf (finally) gets his dragon in the second design.  The third image, yet to be completed in it's entirety, a vision of a gothic couple echoing of beauty, love and fashion to die for!  </p>
<p>We want to be able to bring you new designs on not just dresses but on t-shirts and hoodies as well as post cards and prints!</p>

<div>Kairos T-band allows you to wear your favorite wristwatch while enjoying all the benefits a smartwatch can bring. <br/><br/>Smartwatches and wearable devices (smart bands) are here to stay. It began as a simple notification extension of your smart phone. It evolved into counting your steps, calories, and sleep patterns. We are now seeing more and more app support where you can control music, turn speech to text, GPS navigation, and also remote starting your vehicle. More recently a lot of attention has been given to the health benefits of a wearable device. The ability to constantly measure your heart rate, sweat, stress levels, etc., can help analyze your body in a manner we have never seen before.  </div>
<div>But there's just one problem. Watches expresses who you are. Not everyone is a techie and may not want to wear a watch with the same brand that makes refrigerators. The solution?

<h3>T-band ND / HD / OD: </h3>
<div>There are three models of the T-band. <br/>
<br/>
</div>
<h4>T-Band ND (No Display): </h4>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1050485/files/20141126234415-tband_noWatch_noDisplay_02.png?1417074255"" src="""" style=""""/></p>(* T-band ND shown with KAIROS MSW 115M model) </div>
<div>
<p>T-BAND ND (No Display) model is designed for people who want
extended battery life, basic notifications (via vibrator and multi-color LED
indicator), and activity (fitness/sleep), health data monitoring without the
need for fancy displays or touch sensor capabilities. This is the ultimate
businessmen’s smart watch, or rather a wearable device (smartband). Battery
life is expected to last more than 7 days with the ND model. </p>
<p>Features: <br/>
On board Kairos OS will be able to push notifications such as text messages,
incoming calls, and also push alerts from available apps via a discreet
multi-color LED indicator and/or vibrator motor. On top of having multiple
sensors such as 9-axis gyroscope, accelerometer, compass and optical sensor,
the ND model also gets GSR (Galvanic Skin Sensor) which detects skin
temperature and sweat. </p>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
<h4>T-BAND HD (Hidden Display):</h4>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1050486/files/20141126234432-tband_noWatch_led_pedometer.png?1417074272"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>T-BAND HD (Hidden Display) model is designed for people who
want all of the smart watch functions while being super discreet. LED panels
are embedded below a thin “membrane” like material which hides the display. When
it’s turned off (default mode), the T-band HD actually looks like the ND model
(rubber band). When there is a push notification or alert, the hidden LED panel
lights up and display the necessary information. Battery life is same as the OD
model (200mAH) which is expected to last 2-3 days on a full charge. The HD
model however has one downside- it can only display English alphanumeric text
and numbers. Non-alphabet characters (such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean Arabic,
Russia, etc.) will not be displayed. Images and videos are also not able to be
displayed through this model. </p>
<br/>
</div>
<h4>T-BAND OD (PMOLED DISPLAY): </h4>
<div>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1050488/files/20141126234448-tband_noWatch_health.png?1417074288"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>T-BAND OD (OLED Display) model is designed for the ultimate
techie who also loves his/her analog wristwatch. The unit is comprised of a
curved PMOLED display (active viewing area 11mmx25m with 170dpi resolution),
touch sensor, and hardened mineral glass with special anti-scratch coating. The
display is adequately bright with equally adequate resolution. Kairos has opted
to go with these specs in order to maximize battery life. The unit is powered
by ARM® Cortex-M4 processor with Dual mode Bluetooth Classic and BLE. This
setup allows the T-band to be compatible with a wide range of smartphone models
(from old to new). The OD model is also equipped with an on board Mic for
Speech to Text capabilities (requires 3<sup>rd</sup> party app support). </p>

</div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Award winning design (Red Dot Design Award 2014 – Honorable Mention).
The MSW 115 model design was inspired by inverting the traditional desktop
computer and recreating nostalgic memories of the PC revolution. The face plate
mimics a PCB design, while the second hand has been turned into a fan blade to
mimic the fan on the desktop used to cool down the electronic components. A fan
cover (mesh) is positioned on top of the open heart (wheel balance) area as
well. The watch dimension is 13.5mm high and is 46mm in diameter (excluding
crown). This version will have the popular skeleton lug designs from the
initial concept drawings (actual photos shows non skeleton design as the
prototype of the skeleton design lug ends were not ready at the time of the photo
shoot). Weight is approximately 120g. MSW, as well as SSW models are designed
for true-watch enthusiasts who prefer larger dimensions and solid weight.
However, keep in mind that with different adapters on the T-band you are able
to interchange the watch with other watch brands. (Some watches have very
unique size or lug end designs. Although Kairos will try to make numerous types
of adapters, availability for all lug end sizes and designs is not guaranteed.)
</p>
<p>The MSW 115 models are equipped with Miyota Japan Movements
(part of Citizen Group). It uses the highly reputable and reliable 82S7 model
(21 Jewels, 21600 bph, 42 hour power reserve). The watch is 3ATM (30meters)
water resistant. </p>
<p>Materials: Stainless steel 316L, Double Gold plating (for
Gold models only), DLC coated Black (for Black models only), Sapphire Crystal
glass. </p>

<div>
<p>The SSW 158 model brings together classical design elements
with a sporty edge. Enlarged numbers provide character to the design as well as
demanding attention. The SSW 158 design was designed to attract attention from
1 meter away, but also look exquisite up close. The watch dimension is 13.5mm
high and is 46mm in diameter (excluding crown). This version will have the
popular skeleton lug designs from the initial concept drawings (actual photos
shows non skeleton design as the prototype of the skeleton design lug ends were
not ready at the time of the photo shoot). Weight is approximately 120g. MSW,

<p>The SSW 158 models are equipped with a highly reputable
Soprod Swiss movement (part of Festina Group). It uses the A10BV-2 movement (25
Jewels, 28800 bph, 42 hour power reserve). The watch is 3ATM (30 meters) water
resistant. SSW 158 models also have an open back design (hardened mineral
glass) that proudly shows the movements. It also has Kairos logo engraved on
the rotor. </p>
<p>Materials: Stainless steel 316L, Double Gold plating (for
Gold models only), DLC coated Black (for Black models only), Sapphire Crystal
glass. </p>

<h2>KAIROS OS: </h2>
<div>
<p>Light. Functional. Robust. </p>
<p>Kairos Team has been hard at work creating a solid platform
(OS) for Kairos products. The platform is based on a time-tested system called
RTOS (which is used by several other smartwatch companies already). Kairos OS
will be compatible with iOS, Android and Microsoft Phones. Instead of focusing
on the ability to play certain games, play video clips, take photos, or making
it compatible with as many apps as possible, Kairos OS has been focused on
reliability, functionality, and compatibility with the most core and essential
apps available. Another benefit this brings is the extra battery power it can
provide – even with a smaller pack. Kairos plans to make SDK/API packages
available for third party developers from Q2 of 2015. </p>

<hr/>
<h3>How it all began: </h3>It was summer of 2013. Smartwatches were being adopted by early tech adopters from around the world. It was going to be the next big thing in hardware start-ups. Fall comes around and global electronic conglomerates start to enter the race. <br/><br/>As a serial tech entrepreneur, early adopter, but also a watch enthusiast, Sam, the founder of Kairos Watches simply wanted to make a smartwatch that he would want to wear. A watch that other watch enthusiasts might also welcome. <br/><br/>After filing the first of patents in October, 2013, Sam started to put together his own A-team from around the world. They weren't ex-Apple, or ex-Google, or ex-Samsung employees, but they all had <i><b>passion</b></i> in what Kairos was attempting to do. Like all hardware start-ups, Kairos began life without a fancy office. By early 2014, the team was able to put together 8 key suppliers and manufacturing partners. Each partner company's requirement - share the same passion as the team. We were finally ready. Investors were skeptical. Who would pay $1000 or even $500 for a new start-up operated smart watch? We had no choice but turn to the power of the crowd. 
<div>May 15, 2014: Pre-order campaign for Kairos Mechanical Smart Watch Hybrid was launched. Without a working prototype to show, Kairos decided to do a ""soft launch"" of the campaign from their own website - just enough to get the word out and attract support from people who believed in us. <br/><br/><h3>Milestones:</h3>Within HOURS of the launch, pre-orders started to pour in, passing the $100,000 mark in just 48 hours. It would take only 40 days to reach $1M, and eventually totaled $1.4M. Investors started to ring in. Kairos closed 2 rounds of Series A funding from strategic (manufacturing/corporate) investors and VCs only. With new funding in place, development and production of Kairos components got into full swing. Kairos ran an open-discussion style of developing the products. It opened a blog and shared the progress. It started to openly discuss the good and the bad on Facebook. 192,000 Facebook fans became our friends and supporters. Awards were given. Kairos won the prestige Red Dot Design Award - Honorable Mention for 2014. Patents were granted (July 22nd, 2014). New team members were added. Partnerships were made (Microsoft, Misfit, etc.). Now we are ready. We are prepared. </div>
<div>
<br/>Kairos is now launching the T-band with the support and encouragements from our fans, friends, supporters and customers. </div>
<div>Let's make history once again and bring T-band to life! </div>

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Why Crowdfund? </span><br/>
</div>
<div> <p>Crowdfunding is more than just about raising money. It's also about sharing the journey together with our first customers. </p>
<p>Funds - Although Kairos Watches already has funding from the previous hybrid watch pre-order campaign, the team felt that it wasn't right to divert the funds for research and development of the T-band. The T-band shares the same PCB, Firmware, and Analog Watch (MSW/SSW) components as the Hybrid Watch. However, it requires a new type of shell, battery, display (curved PMOLED), touch sensor, clamps, and adapters that is unique to the T-band. YOUR pre-orders and support will go into funding these components. <br/></p>

<p>Fortunately, KAIROS has been able to put together a dedicated group of high quality suppliers from around the world. Display &amp; Touch Sensors: South Korea, PCB / Battery: China/Hong Kong, Mechanical movements: Japan (Miyota Citizen), Swiss (Soprod). In fact, Kairos already has a working POC unit (Display was provided by Samsung Display - please note, production model display supplier has not yet been finalized). <br/><br/>There is however, the risk of delays. Although we have prepared and prepared ... unforeseen circumstances can delay the production from weeks to months. Things like FCC / CE certifications, tooling and retooling (if changes are required), and funding (if extra funding is required), can all cause delays. We will do our absolute best in meeting the estimated shipping dates and we will share all details of the production via our Facebook and Blogs as we have done so in the past. </p>

</div></div>","Watches express who you are. 
Kairos T-band allows you to wear your favorite wristwatch while enjoying all the benefits a smartwatch can bring. Smartwatches and wearable devices (smart bands) are here to stay. It began as a simple notification extension of your smart phone. It evolved into counting your steps, calories, and sleep patterns. We are now seeing more and more app support where you can control music, turn speech to text, GPS navigation, and also remote starting your vehicle. More recently a lot of attention has been given to the health benefits of a wearable device. The ability to constantly measure your heart rate, sweat, stress levels, etc., can help analyze your body in a manner we have never seen before.  
But there's just one problem. Watches expresses who you are. Not everyone is a techie and may not want to wear a watch with the same brand that makes refrigerators. The solution? Kairos T-band!





""Watches are more than just an accessory that tells time. It’s a personal story. It’s your own brand identity.What color, style, and brand you wear tells a story about who you are.""
It holds sentimental value. Memories are infused to it.
It’s an asset – something you hold onto and possibly pass on. This is why Kairos T-band was created. Enjoy all the benefits a smartwatch can provide without sacrificing what you love.
T-band. The revolution begins now.




T-band ND / HD / OD: 
There are three models of the T-band. 


T-Band ND (No Display): 


(* T-band ND shown with KAIROS MSW 115M model) 

T-BAND ND (No Display) model is designed for people who want
extended battery life, basic notifications (via vibrator and multi-color LED
indicator), and activity (fitness/sleep), health data monitoring without the
need for fancy displays or touch sensor capabilities. This is the ultimate
businessmen’s smart watch, or rather a wearable device (smartband). Battery
life is expected to last more than 7 days with the ND model. 
Features: 
On board Kairos OS will be able to push notifications such as text messages,
incoming calls, and also push alerts from available apps via a discreet
multi-color LED indicator and/or vibrator motor. On top of having multiple
sensors such as 9-axis gyroscope, accelerometer, compass and optical sensor,
the ND model also gets GSR (Galvanic Skin Sensor) which detects skin
temperature and sweat. 



T-BAND HD (Hidden Display):


T-BAND HD (Hidden Display) model is designed for people who
want all of the smart watch functions while being super discreet. LED panels
are embedded below a thin “membrane” like material which hides the display. When
it’s turned off (default mode), the T-band HD actually looks like the ND model
(rubber band). When there is a push notification or alert, the hidden LED panel
lights up and display the necessary information. Battery life is same as the OD
model (200mAH) which is expected to last 2-3 days on a full charge. The HD
model however has one downside- it can only display English alphanumeric text
and numbers. Non-alphabet characters (such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean Arabic,
Russia, etc.) will not be displayed. Images and videos are also not able to be
displayed through this model. 


T-BAND OD (PMOLED DISPLAY): 



T-BAND OD (OLED Display) model is designed for the ultimate
techie who also loves his/her analog wristwatch. The unit is comprised of a
curved PMOLED display (active viewing area 11mmx25m with 170dpi resolution),
touch sensor, and hardened mineral glass with special anti-scratch coating. The
display is adequately bright with equally adequate resolution. Kairos has opted
to go with these specs in order to maximize battery life. The unit is powered
by ARM® Cortex-M4 processor with Dual mode Bluetooth Classic and BLE. This
setup allows the T-band to be compatible with a wide range of smartphone models
(from old to new). The OD model is also equipped with an on board Mic for
Speech to Text capabilities (requires 3rd party app support). 


KAIROS MSW 115: MECHANICAL ANALOG WATCH w/ JAPAN MOV'T



*MSW 115M Mechanical Watch with Rubber and Leather Band 


*MSW 115G - Double Plated Rose Gold Mechanical Watch with Rubber and Leather Band 


*MSW 115B - DLC Plated All Black Mechanical Watch with Rubber and Leather Band 


Award winning design (Red Dot Design Award 2014 – Honorable Mention).
The MSW 115 model design was inspired by inverting the traditional desktop
computer and recreating nostalgic memories of the PC revolution. The face plate
mimics a PCB design, while the second hand has been turned into a fan blade to
mimic the fan on the desktop used to cool down the electronic components. A fan
cover (mesh) is positioned on top of the open heart (wheel balance) area as
well. The watch dimension is 13.5mm high and is 46mm in diameter (excluding
crown). This version will have the popular skeleton lug designs from the
initial concept drawings (actual photos shows non skeleton design as the
prototype of the skeleton design lug ends were not ready at the time of the photo
shoot). Weight is approximately 120g. MSW, as well as SSW models are designed
for true-watch enthusiasts who prefer larger dimensions and solid weight.
However, keep in mind that with different adapters on the T-band you are able
to interchange the watch with other watch brands. (Some watches have very
unique size or lug end designs. Although Kairos will try to make numerous types
of adapters, availability for all lug end sizes and designs is not guaranteed.)

The MSW 115 models are equipped with Miyota Japan Movements
(part of Citizen Group). It uses the highly reputable and reliable 82S7 model
(21 Jewels, 21600 bph, 42 hour power reserve). The watch is 3ATM (30meters)
water resistant. 
Materials: Stainless steel 316L, Double Gold plating (for
Gold models only), DLC coated Black (for Black models only), Sapphire Crystal
glass. 

KAIROS MSW 158: MECHANICAL ANALOG WATCH w/ SWISS MOV'T

*MSW 158M Mechanical Watch with Rubber and Leather Band >



*MSW 158G - Double Plated Rose Gold Mechanical Watch with Rubber and Leather Band 


*MSW 158B - DLC Plated All Black Mechanical Watch with Rubber and Leather Band 



The SSW 158 model brings together classical design elements
with a sporty edge. Enlarged numbers provide character to the design as well as
demanding attention. The SSW 158 design was designed to attract attention from
1 meter away, but also look exquisite up close. The watch dimension is 13.5mm
high and is 46mm in diameter (excluding crown). This version will have the
popular skeleton lug designs from the initial concept drawings (actual photos
shows non skeleton design as the prototype of the skeleton design lug ends were
not ready at the time of the photo shoot). Weight is approximately 120g. MSW,
as well as SSW models are designed for true-watch enthusiasts who prefer larger
dimensions and solid weight. However, keep in mind that with different adapters
on the T-band you are able to interchange the watch with other watch brands. (Some
watches have very unique size or lug end designs. Although Kairos will try to
make numerous types of adapters, availability for all lug end sizes and designs
is not guaranteed.) 
The SSW 158 models are equipped with a highly reputable
Soprod Swiss movement (part of Festina Group). It uses the A10BV-2 movement (25
Jewels, 28800 bph, 42 hour power reserve). The watch is 3ATM (30 meters) water
resistant. SSW 158 models also have an open back design (hardened mineral
glass) that proudly shows the movements. It also has Kairos logo engraved on
the rotor. 
Materials: Stainless steel 316L, Double Gold plating (for
Gold models only), DLC coated Black (for Black models only), Sapphire Crystal
glass.

KAIROS OS: 

Light. Functional. Robust. 
Kairos Team has been hard at work creating a solid platform
(OS) for Kairos products. The platform is based on a time-tested system called
RTOS (which is used by several other smartwatch companies already). Kairos OS
will be compatible with iOS, Android and Microsoft Phones. Instead of focusing
on the ability to play certain games, play video clips, take photos, or making
it compatible with as many apps as possible, Kairos OS has been focused on
reliability, functionality, and compatibility with the most core and essential
apps available. Another benefit this brings is the extra battery power it can
provide – even with a smaller pack. Kairos plans to make SDK/API packages
available for third party developers from Q2 of 2015.

How it all began: It was summer of 2013. Smartwatches were being adopted by early tech adopters from around the world. It was going to be the next big thing in hardware start-ups. Fall comes around and global electronic conglomerates start to enter the race. As a serial tech entrepreneur, early adopter, but also a watch enthusiast, Sam, the founder of Kairos Watches simply wanted to make a smartwatch that he would want to wear. A watch that other watch enthusiasts might also welcome. After filing the first of patents in October, 2013, Sam started to put together his own A-team from around the world. They weren't ex-Apple, or ex-Google, or ex-Samsung employees, but they all had passion in what Kairos was attempting to do. Like all hardware start-ups, Kairos began life without a fancy office. By early 2014, the team was able to put together 8 key suppliers and manufacturing partners. Each partner company's requirement - share the same passion as the team. We were finally ready. Investors were skeptical. Who would pay $1000 or even $500 for a new start-up operated smart watch? We had no choice but turn to the power of the crowd. 
May 15, 2014: Pre-order campaign for Kairos Mechanical Smart Watch Hybrid was launched. Without a working prototype to show, Kairos decided to do a ""soft launch"" of the campaign from their own website - just enough to get the word out and attract support from people who believed in us. Milestones:Within HOURS of the launch, pre-orders started to pour in, passing the $100,000 mark in just 48 hours. It would take only 40 days to reach $1M, and eventually totaled $1.4M. Investors started to ring in. Kairos closed 2 rounds of Series A funding from strategic (manufacturing/corporate) investors and VCs only. With new funding in place, development and production of Kairos components got into full swing. Kairos ran an open-discussion style of developing the products. It opened a blog and shared the progress. It started to openly discuss the good and the bad on Facebook. 192,000 Facebook fans became our friends and supporters. Awards were given. Kairos won the prestige Red Dot Design Award - Honorable Mention for 2014. Patents were granted (July 22nd, 2014). New team members were added. Partnerships were made (Microsoft, Misfit, etc.). Now we are ready. We are prepared. 

Kairos is now launching the T-band with the support and encouragements from our fans, friends, supporters and customers. 
Let's make history once again and bring T-band to life! 


Why Crowdfund? 

 Crowdfunding is more than just about raising money. It's also about sharing the journey together with our first customers. 
Funds - Although Kairos Watches already has funding from the previous hybrid watch pre-order campaign, the team felt that it wasn't right to divert the funds for research and development of the T-band. The T-band shares the same PCB, Firmware, and Analog Watch (MSW/SSW) components as the Hybrid Watch. However, it requires a new type of shell, battery, display (curved PMOLED), touch sensor, clamps, and adapters that is unique to the T-band. YOUR pre-orders and support will go into funding these components. 

    Development Stage: WORKING POC (Proof of Concept): 

* Kairos MSW115M model shown - 90% completed. Production model will have black mesh (over the open heart area) with less grills. It will also come with the popular skeleton style lug ends in the concept photos. 

* Kairos MSW115G model shown (see comments above) 

*SOPROD SWISS MOVEMENT - custom crafted for KAIROS SSW 158 MODELS

* KAIROS MSW 115M With T-BAND OD - POC Please note: The T-BAND POC (Proof of Concept Prototype) is wider and bigger than the actual production model T-band due to the extra large size of the display which was supplied to us by Samsung. Production model may or may not use Samsung Display. Production version of the T-band OD will also have smaller display in order to fit the band better. Production model of the T-band will be 22mm which can be used on various adapters to fit watch lug ends from 18 to 24mm. 

*T-BAND OD POC PROTOTYPE 


*KAIROS MSW115M w/ TBAND (Production size spec dummy unit) 
Please note: the production model of MSW 115M models will come with glossy basel finish (matte finish shown in photo). 














    Risks & Challenges The team behind Kairos has decades of years in experience combined in hardware and software development. However, the biggest challenge in any hardware start-up is the suppliers. 
Fortunately, KAIROS has been able to put together a dedicated group of high quality suppliers from around the world. Display & Touch Sensors: South Korea, PCB / Battery: China/Hong Kong, Mechanical movements: Japan (Miyota Citizen), Swiss (Soprod). In fact, Kairos already has a working POC unit (Display was provided by Samsung Display - please note, production model display supplier has not yet been finalized). There is however, the risk of delays. Although we have prepared and prepared ... unforeseen circumstances can delay the production from weeks to months. Things like FCC / CE certifications, tooling and retooling (if changes are required), and funding (if extra funding is required), can all cause delays. We will do our absolute best in meeting the estimated shipping dates and we will share all details of the production via our Facebook and Blogs as we have done so in the past. 



    Kairos Team:  We are not ex-Googlers, or ex-Apple, or ex-Samsung guys. We are guys (and gals) from around the world that share the same dedicated PASSION for Kairos. Here is a list of a few of our team members so far:

<p>It all started when my friend giving me a leather jacket on my 20th birthday. It was the best present that I ever got, it was then and there that I fell in love with leather jackets and in future it would prove to be the catalyst that changed my life.</p>
<p>Pakistan my home country is among one of the largest leather producing nations. My love for leather jackets led me to Sialkot a Pakistani city <b>acclaimed globally for leather products</b>. I got the chance to visit the tanneries and met the leather craftsmen. It was a great learning experience to be among the people who were actually creating the things i loved. </p>
<p>I moved to England for my studies and saw the price tags on jackets made from my country and I was surprised to see the difference between how much it actually costed to make one and the retail price. More importantly how less the craftsmen got out of it and I wanted to do something about it. </p>
<p>When I came back to Pakistan I went straight to Sialkot to my surprise, skilled craftsmen struggled to get work. The one’s that did was at low wages and the over all conditions weren’t all that great. I wanted to change that I had the tech experience and my passion for leather the collaboration came naturally.</p>
<p>So I teamed up with people in the industry, set-up stitching unit in Sialkot. We collaborated with designers and starting working on our first line of jackets and after 2 years of hard work we are presenting Mont5!</p>

<p>Over the last two years we have been working on selecting the best materials, perfecting the fit, testing different leather types for their quality, grain, pattern and most importantly, feel on the body while wearing.</p>
<p>We have managed to put all pieces together and have brought these five designs to life. Raised initial funds in November last year and managed to procure leather and other raw material. Hired team of stitchers, patron masters and cutters on permanent salary. </p>
<p>Now we need you guys to keep supporting us so that we can make impact through your help in lives of skilled craftsmen for longer run. </p>

Traditional stretchable waist and sleeve panels are there to give the user a perfect fit. Rakaposhi features a front YKK zipper closure, 7 pockets and an extra collar compartment.

Don't get us wrong, leather is expensive but it's not as expensive as luxury brands make you believe. Big budget brands spend on marketing, advertising, warehousing and pay off half a dozen middlemen. On top of which they charge you huge margin. We've slashed all the middle men out and are producing goods for you and shipping directly to your doorstep. That means a big price cut and a fair share to the craftsmen working on the product.  
 

We believe in fair business practice that's why we not only have craftsmen on payroll but they are part of the team, they get a share in each sale on top of that going forward we want to be able to give them free health benefits, an education for their children and a pension plan. 
All this while keeping the price low and with your help we can!

  


  

 

 

 Here is what Alan Hood from US, has to say about working with Zia (the founder)

 

 

It all started when my friend giving me a leather jacket on my 20th birthday. It was the best present that I ever got, it was then and there that I fell in love with leather jackets and in future it would prove to be the catalyst that changed my life.
Pakistan my home country is among one of the largest leather producing nations. My love for leather jackets led me to Sialkot a Pakistani city acclaimed globally for leather products. I got the chance to visit the tanneries and met the leather craftsmen. It was a great learning experience to be among the people who were actually creating the things i loved. 
I moved to England for my studies and saw the price tags on jackets made from my country and I was surprised to see the difference between how much it actually costed to make one and the retail price. More importantly how less the craftsmen got out of it and I wanted to do something about it. 
When I came back to Pakistan I went straight to Sialkot to my surprise, skilled craftsmen struggled to get work. The one’s that did was at low wages and the over all conditions weren’t all that great. I wanted to change that I had the tech experience and my passion for leather the collaboration came naturally.
So I teamed up with people in the industry, set-up stitching unit in Sialkot. We collaborated with designers and starting working on our first line of jackets and after 2 years of hard work we are presenting Mont5!
 

Over the last two years we have been working on selecting the best materials, perfecting the fit, testing different leather types for their quality, grain, pattern and most importantly, feel on the body while wearing.
We have managed to put all pieces together and have brought these five designs to life. Raised initial funds in November last year and managed to procure leather and other raw material. Hired team of stitchers, patron masters and cutters on permanent salary. 
Now we need you guys to keep supporting us so that we can make impact through your help in lives of skilled craftsmen for longer run. 
 

We have named our jackets after famous peaks, valleys and glaciers that exist in the northern region of Pakistan.

<i>I'm not special nor better then anyone reading this, I'm just a fan of REAL Hip Hop concerned about it's future- E-STONE CEO All Things Possible LLC/ HHQ Clothing.</i><p><i><br/></i></p>
<p>Hip Hop music is an art form born on the streets of New York City in the late 70's created by a culture of people who, for the most part, were not given equal footing in their quest for the 'American Dream' Nevertheless, these people were well apt at turning lemons into lemonade, one being Hip Hop, a refreshing drink that quenched the thirst of it's listeners world wide.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things have changed. This amazing art form has been taken from the very people who created it and is now controlled by people who are apathetic to hip hop music, it's culture, and it's people. As a result, for a period of 20 years, Hip Hop has been raped by these very people to no end. These people produce and distribute a hip hop music filled with vile lyrics that promote the cultural degradation of a particular people, objectifying females as nothing more than flesh, promoting animalistic violence, and the dilution of lyrical content resulting in the death of REAL Hip Hop.</p>
<p>The effects of this poison (wrongly labeled as hip hop) can be seen every day amongst our citizenry:</p>

<p>Based in Los Angeles, Ca. gives us the advantage of being in the heart of the fashion industry. Downtown Los Angeles is home to the 'Garment District' and an amazing assortment of screen printing facilities, embroidery shops, apparel suppliers, as well as distributors.</p>
<p>We have relationships with several screen printing facilities here locally that are more then ready for full scale production.</p>

<p>We have streamlined our offerings to shirts, caps, and our pen and pad accessory  with the capability of adding hoodies as a stretch goal. By keeping our offerings streamlined we have full confidence our orders can be fulfilled even in the case of unseen detriments.</p>
<p>Our main challenge is NOT fulfilling our orders, we have full confidence in that, but our goal of creating a MOVEMENT, via the message our products inherit, is what we are truly striving for.

<p>It's no secret today's Hip Hop has been manipulated by people who don't know or could care less about our Hip Hop Culture and is reason why Hip Hop is dying. <br/>By supporting Hip Hop Quotables we can change this and save Hip Hop.</p>
<p>Our clothing line does not represent any one particular individual, rather, it represents Hip Hop Culture as a whole. It represents the beauty of Hip Hop and understanding that the foundation of Hip Hop is it's lyrics, hence our tagline- IT'S ABOUT THE LYRICS.

I'm not special nor better then anyone reading this, I'm just a fan of REAL Hip Hop concerned about it's future- E-STONE CEO All Things Possible LLC/ HHQ Clothing.
Hip Hop music is an art form born on the streets of New York City in the late 70's created by a culture of people who, for the most part, were not given equal footing in their quest for the 'American Dream' Nevertheless, these people were well apt at turning lemons into lemonade, one being Hip Hop, a refreshing drink that quenched the thirst of it's listeners world wide.
Unfortunately, things have changed. This amazing art form has been taken from the very people who created it and is now controlled by people who are apathetic to hip hop music, it's culture, and it's people. As a result, for a period of 20 years, Hip Hop has been raped by these very people to no end. These people produce and distribute a hip hop music filled with vile lyrics that promote the cultural degradation of a particular people, objectifying females as nothing more than flesh, promoting animalistic violence, and the dilution of lyrical content resulting in the death of REAL Hip Hop.
The effects of this poison (wrongly labeled as hip hop) can be seen every day amongst our citizenry:

                                     This is NOT Hip Hop and is clearly the effects of garbage Hip Hop.

   
  Years and years of lyrical frustration has resulted in this spectacle. A whole generation of Hip Hop fans have been duped. We must put an end to this.        


In today's Hip Hop STRIPPERS are now granted the privilege to hold the microphone. Unfreakn' believable!


Take a look for yourself. Warning: If you really love Hip Hop like we do at Hip Hop Quotables this will make you cry: http://youtu.be/KRU24IhfRGE

                                



It's time to take a stance and refocus Hip Hop back to the standards that were set by it's early pioneers. Standards that focused on lyrical content first and foremost.                  
Hip Hop pioneers from left to right: LL Cool J, Russell Simmons, Heavy D, and Jalil Hutchins of Whodini.



Hip Hop Quotables is a brand new clothing line created to GUARD, EDUCATE, RESPECT, AND HONOR real Hip Hop and to abolish anything and anyone who desecrates this wonderful art form.


This is our 'World Wide Logo' rendered in a distressed condition. It's to symbolize the beating Hip Hop has taken over the last several years yet it's still standing... but for how long?

It is our goal to showcase Hip Hop the way it was meant to be when it was established over 35 years ago, but not in the same manner. Rather then using a microphone and a funky beat, we will utilize a new platform in which to 'spit' our lyrics. This platform is readily accessible to people all over the world and is used in a multitude of ways to convey various statements. This platform being the world renown t-shirt!
Hip Hop Quotables will be the first lyrically branded clothing line with an emphasis on thought provoking lyrical content, exactly what is missing in todays Hip Hop. Instead of LISTENING to the lyrics you will WEAR the lyrics, which we feel is pretty dope!

This beautiful lyrically emblazoned 100% cotton t-shirt boldly displays our 'Iconic Logo' with one of our many amazing quotes, sure to raise awareness throughout the Hip Hop community, resting perfectly on top.


Ladies, don't worry we got you covered. We realize the importance of the female's perspective in hip hop which, unfortunately, is seldom seen nor heard, in today's hip hop.



All of our shirts come in various colors and sizes resulting in an amazing fashion statement complimented with bold thought provoking lyrics- something that's sorely missing in today's Hip Hop.



Here is another version of our 'World Wide Logo' rendered in a 'clean' look. It's dedicated to all of the Hip Hop fans across the world. It symbolizes our oneness and our unified love for REAL hip hop.


The Lyrical Legend Award consist of a meticulously sculpted brain that sits upon a notepad accompanied by the mighty pen. It's foundation consist of a sturdy black marble base which beautifully completes the symbolism. It's appearance may not be as elegant as other awards but it's meaning is invaluable to those who truly love and understand hip hop.

This award will be selected periodically and input from our fans will be allowed throughout the process. The Lyrical Legend award is not awarded based on popularity rather it is based on lyrical impact by any given artist whom we feel meets our criteria as a hip hop company and as our tagline purports- It's About The Lyrics®

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>It's easy to watch what's happening in American politics today and get fed up: with the government, with business people, with the system in general.  As we started paying more attention to what's happening with America's unemployment levels we started asking what we could do to help out.  The first question we asked was: what jobs are we outsourcing overseas that <em>could </em>be brought back home?</p>
<p>What we found out was truly inspiring.  It turns out, all those banners, hang tags, t shirts and hoodies that we've had printed in China can be done here for only a fraction more.  Same is true for the development and design of our packaging materials.  Using European and Asian partners to fill orders and distribute product for us is also unnecessary.  With a minimal investment in ONE American partner, we expect to bring between $30,000-$50,000 in annual service fees from overseas back to American soil.  No joke.</p>
<p>We're inspired by these findings, and we wanted to ask for the public's support on this initiative not only to help us cover this up-front investment, but also to help share this model with other companies, and inspire them to do the same.  If we sit around waiting for Uncle Sam to make American service providers more attractive, we could wait forever.  By directly supporting the partners we intend to work with, we can all make a little bit of difference in this economy.</p>
<p>You'll notice that all of the rewards being offered in this program are heavily discounted.  The Roman Mitts at $25 are selling for $62 on our website right now.  The Head Skis at $350 are selling for $600 in stores.  These discounts are our contribution to you for backing this project, and to the country that brought us freedom fries and Super Man.  Take advantage of these rewards, and this remarkable opportunity to make a difference in our economy.</p>
<p>We're a small company, but we make a strong effort to provide great gloves at reasonable prices.  We employ some of the best athletes in the world to help us test and develop gloves, and through that process have arrived at a truly remarkable product.  </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We need at least $25,000 to transition these jobs back home.  Some of this money will go as an investment directly to our new partner to help them retrofit their facitilites, and the rest will help us cover the costs of re-training our people and re-working our entire design and distribution processes.  The more money we raise, the less risky this campaign becomes, and the more sustainable the move back home.</p>

<p><strong>WHO IS SIMON DUMONT?</strong></p>
<p>If you're not familiar with who Simon is yet, don't be ashamed.  The world of pro skiers is a small world after all.  Simon has been trailblazing the sport of free-skiing for years now.  He's one of the most decorated skiers in the sports, with numerous metals in events like X-Games, The Dew Tour, and many, many others.</p>
<p>This video showcases a recent feat of Simon's on the slopes: </p>
<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/dUqsznQyyz0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://youtu.be/dUqsznQyyz0</a></p>
<p>Suffice it to say, Simon needs his ski setup (head to toe) to be the best of the best in order to last in these cold harsh conditions.  Midway through his ski career, Simon realized that one part of his body was consistently under-served: his hands.  </p>
<p>Simon has recruited a team of some of the best skiers in the world to represent the brand and help him figure out how to build a better glove.  He rounded the team out by bringing on expert advisers in business, in production, and in Marketing.  Today, Empire Attire employs a small team of full time employees in Boulder, CO and sells gloves in more than a dozen countries around the globe.  For more information about us, please check out our website here: <a href=""http://www.empireattire.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.empireattire.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Perks Explored</strong></p>
<p>Our rewards are flexible.  If you want Simon to sign your gloves or skis consider it done.  Before any of this product ships we'll send out a survey asking for size, color and other preferences.  During that time, you'll be able to give us special instructions if you need anything else.  If you want to know if something is possible, just email us at info@empireattire.com and put ""Kickstarter"" in the subject line of the email.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
It's easy to watch what's happening in American politics today and get fed up: with the government, with business people, with the system in general.  As we started paying more attention to what's happening with America's unemployment levels we started asking what we could do to help out.  The first question we asked was: what jobs are we outsourcing overseas that could be brought back home?
What we found out was truly inspiring.  It turns out, all those banners, hang tags, t shirts and hoodies that we've had printed in China can be done here for only a fraction more.  Same is true for the development and design of our packaging materials.  Using European and Asian partners to fill orders and distribute product for us is also unnecessary.  With a minimal investment in ONE American partner, we expect to bring between $30,000-$50,000 in annual service fees from overseas back to American soil.  No joke.
We're inspired by these findings, and we wanted to ask for the public's support on this initiative not only to help us cover this up-front investment, but also to help share this model with other companies, and inspire them to do the same.  If we sit around waiting for Uncle Sam to make American service providers more attractive, we could wait forever.  By directly supporting the partners we intend to work with, we can all make a little bit of difference in this economy.
You'll notice that all of the rewards being offered in this program are heavily discounted.  The Roman Mitts at $25 are selling for $62 on our website right now.  The Head Skis at $350 are selling for $600 in stores.  These discounts are our contribution to you for backing this project, and to the country that brought us freedom fries and Super Man.  Take advantage of these rewards, and this remarkable opportunity to make a difference in our economy.
We're a small company, but we make a strong effort to provide great gloves at reasonable prices.  We employ some of the best athletes in the world to help us test and develop gloves, and through that process have arrived at a truly remarkable product.  
What We Need & What You Get


We need at least $25,000 to transition these jobs back home.  Some of this money will go as an investment directly to our new partner to help them retrofit their facitilites, and the rest will help us cover the costs of re-training our people and re-working our entire design and distribution processes.  The more money we raise, the less risky this campaign becomes, and the more sustainable the move back home.


WHO IS SIMON DUMONT?
If you're not familiar with who Simon is yet, don't be ashamed.  The world of pro skiers is a small world after all.  Simon has been trailblazing the sport of free-skiing for years now.  He's one of the most decorated skiers in the sports, with numerous metals in events like X-Games, The Dew Tour, and many, many others.
This video showcases a recent feat of Simon's on the slopes: 
http://youtu.be/dUqsznQyyz0
Suffice it to say, Simon needs his ski setup (head to toe) to be the best of the best in order to last in these cold harsh conditions.  Midway through his ski career, Simon realized that one part of his body was consistently under-served: his hands.  
Simon has recruited a team of some of the best skiers in the world to represent the brand and help him figure out how to build a better glove.  He rounded the team out by bringing on expert advisers in business, in production, and in Marketing.  Today, Empire Attire employs a small team of full time employees in Boulder, CO and sells gloves in more than a dozen countries around the globe.  For more information about us, please check out our website here: www.empireattire.com.
Perks Explored
Our rewards are flexible.  If you want Simon to sign your gloves or skis consider it done.  Before any of this product ships we'll send out a survey asking for size, color and other preferences.  During that time, you'll be able to give us special instructions if you need anything else.  If you want to know if something is possible, just email us at info@empireattire.com and put ""Kickstarter"" in the subject line of the email.

My name's Ben Zacharias, I'm 23, happily married to my beautiful wife Amanda and have an amazing almost 2 year old son. I'm from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada and I've dreamed of starting my own T-Shirt business since I was a little kid, but I just never thought I'd be able to. But recently things changed, and I've taken the first steps towards doing what I've always wanted to. I spent all my savings and ordered a couple shirt styles and some hats. But because I placed such a small order I ended over paying for the shirts and hats and now I have to sell them for a lot more than I was expecting just so I can make a small profit. So now I want to place a bulk order and get the prices down on my shirts. I see way to many companies charging $30 or more for a shirt and I want to go the opposite direction and keep my shirts as cheap as possible. Currently the shirts I'm selling are going for $22.99 and I still think that's too much. So if I can get some funding to help my company, then I can supply shirts to everyone at a much better price. So I'm sure you're wondering what's going to happen with your money once I get it. And it's good that you're thinking about that because it would be silly to just give your money away without knowing where it's going. Which reminds me that all you amazing supporters will be getting gifts, but we'll get to that in a bit. First off all, I want to use the money to order some more shirts and hats in bulk so that I can get my costs down, and save you money in return. With the funds I raise I'll be able to get 8-10 more shirt styles in stock and 3-4 more hat styles. And when I add in the money I can get on my own and from the sales of what I currently have, I'm hoping to bring in even more. And I'll also be placing an order for a whole bunch of stickers because I know everyone loves stickers. If I don't manage to reach my goal though I'll use whatever I manage to raise to order as much as I can,and use the profits from what I currently have to sell to cover as much of the remaining amount as I can. So now let's talk about the perks of being an amazing person and helping out a young entrepreneur. I can only give away stickers for small donations and of course tell you how grateful I am and how amazing you are, but for donations of $20 and up I'll be giving away T-Shirts and Hats and Tote Bags. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So now you're thinking, ""I like this guys shirts, and attitude, but why should I give him my money?"" Well first off, don't you remember that you get awesome gifts out of it? But if that isn't good enough let me try to persuade you more. Besides the fact that I'll be supplying awesome shirts and hats to amazing people at a much lower price than the competitors. I'll also be selling belts, jewelry, shoelaces, socks, sweatpants, yoga pants, sweaters, watches, sunglasses, shoes and much more at unbeatable prices. But without this funding to help my business grow, it will take me a lot longer to get to where I want to be and to be able to stock all of these products. Although I do have a small amount of jewelry, shoelaces and belts being shipped that will be for sale in my online store soon, but that's not what we're worrying about right now. Sorry, I'll try not to get distracted again. I want to run a business where my customers are friends, and yes, I know how cheesy that sounds. But I'm tired of contacting businesses and being ignored because nobody cares. I want to hear feedback from my customers and I want to grow this business around that so that everyone is happy. </div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Of course there's going to be risks with every business. To  be honest I had to return my first batch of hats because the embroidery was badly done on  them. But that's what I'll do for this business. I'll make sure everything meets my very high standards of quality before it gets shipped, and if it doesn't I'll send it right back to the factory to get fixed. You'll never have to worry about quality when you plave an order.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Not able to donate? That's fine too. If you can spread the word about No Rest Apparel and this campaign then you're still doing me a huge favour.

Toc19 is the culmination and expression of this. Toc19: Sunray Silver Toc19: Sapphire Glass Caseback With Exposed Hand Wound Seagull Movement We are two friends who decided it was time to allow our creativeness to determine our future. We believe in individuality, boldness and achieving what you aspire to. Therefore, working at something that fulfils you can become your lifestyle.  Toc19: Graphite Grey We wanted to stay true to what influenced the design, the Bauhaus Design Movement (est. 1919). Our watch incorporates its principles of simplicity and function. In honour of this era, these dial editions will be limited to only 1919 pieces.Bauhaus' Influence Still Remains Today From the offset, Toc wanted to focus on form and function, so delivering a simple yet stylish watch combined with quality materials was vital. The Toc19 is the only model in our initial launch, with dial colour and strap variations the only difference. This allowed us focus on the most important elements which was the substance and materials used. Toc have designed a bespoke custom case from scratch. The case is made from 316L surgical grade stainless steel.Domed Scratch Proof Sapphire Crystal Sapphire Crystal is the 2nd hardest material known to man (2nd only to Diamond) and much harder than Gorilla Glass. Therefore, this seriously scratch proof Sapphire Crystal Glass was the only real option to showcase the Toc19 and its movement.  Side Profile           Two of the dials have a smooth finish: Retro Cream and Carbon Black. The four other dials are finished with a stunning sunray pattern that reflects light at every angle: Crimson Red, Graphite Grey, Emerald Green and Silver Toc19: Sunray Graphite Grey Toc19: Sunray Silver Toc19: Sunray Emerald Green Toc19: Smooth Retro Cream Toc19: Smooth Carbon Black  Toc19: Sunray Crimson Red Toc19: Sunray Crimson Red​ Toc19: Emerald Green Toc19: Retro Cream Toc19: Carbon Black Toc19: Sunray Silver​ We guarantee you get the Toc19 of your choice by allowing you to combine any dial colour with any strap style you like. Build the Toc19 your way.    The hand wound movement is a thing of beauty so we decided to showcase it through the Exhibition Case which is covered by Scratch Proof Sapphire Crystal. The mechanical movement is the Seagull ST3621. It’s reliable and beautiful. You will find yourself mesmerised by the movement of the spring as it powers the watch.Turn the Toc19 over to see the engraved custom steel. Toc19: Sapphire Glass Caseback The Toc logo and Dublin automatically draw your attention but look closely at the special numbering etched into your watch. This is your limited edition Toc19 with your limited edition number reminding you how special it is. Limited to only 1919 of these combined dial colours. That’s special. All straps are made from Italian leather. Toc also makes a point of etching its name into the buckle as well as branding each leather strapWhen the campaign ends, you can then choose the strap you like the most.  Strap: Tan Leather Strap: Red Brown Leather Strap: Black Leather​ Strap: Black Crocodile Style Leather Strap: Red Brown Crocodile Style Leather The case is designed completely from scratch. Every measurement considered and debated on, from the size of the crown, the thickness of the lug, to its perfect weight   When was the last time that you wished you could make a change? Not just any change, a life altering change?

It made me question who I want to be as a fashion designer and what I stand for.In Australia I started surfing. I’ve met so many likeminded people in the water that have inspired me to start something that matters. Being close to nature made me realise I want to contribute in a positive way. The sustainable component of Lemon Spicy makes our swimwear more than a product. You are part of a story, a mission, and a movement anyone can join.Supporting Lemon Spicy makes you part of an exciting initiative that is not just swimwear, but a community of likeminded people that are ready for positive change. We need YOU to make this happen. >>> NEW PERK <<< ​All pieces are fully lined and therefore have great shape retention and maximum durability. All tops and one pieces have removable padding for extra protection and support during water activities.​ -Our swimwear is made from Italian fabric made with Econyl®, a recycled fiber made from ghost fishing nets and other post-consumer waste. Thanks to its innovative construction and presence of Xtra Life Lycra®, our fabric is more chlorine resistant than your average swimwear fabric.It has excellent UV protection and is suncream resistant.What are ghost fishing nets?Fishing nets which are discarded and abandoned at the bottom of our seas and which kill thousands of marine creatures every year. Recovered fishing nets are not sent to the landfill, but they are recycled: by means of a regeneration process they are turned into new raw materials which can be used to create brand new products such as socks, swimsuits, carpets and other textile items. This way, the pollution decreases with every product manufactured.What is Xtra Life Lycra®​?Xtra Life Lycra® Fiber resists fabric breakdown more than 5 times longer than your average chlorine-resistant elastane. Deterioration in swimsuits is mainly determined by elastane breakage, which weakens the fabric and causes a loss of shape and fit. Swimwear garments using Xtra Life LYCRA® Fiber have no significant fiber breakage even after many hours of exposure.Features and benefits of Lemon Spicy swimwear fabric• Sustainable• Smooth and soft• Extra strength• Outstanding quality• Shape retention• Maximum durability• UPF 50+ sun protectionFor my work I have visited many garment factories in Asia and realised the work circumstances are often far from good. Ethical garment manufacturing is hard to come across, but more relevant to consumers and awareness is growing. Taking care of the people that make the clothing in addition to making great high quality swimwear is very important to me.I have picked my manufacturer based on Lemon Spicy's ethics and high standards to ensure that the factory has responsible labour, health and safety practices. Last July I visited my swimwear manufacturer, which is a small factory that has been around for 10 years and is specialised in start-up swimwear brands. The people that make the swimwear take pride in their work, are highly skilled and get paid by the hour, not by piece. It was very heartwarming to meet such a great team and I am very proud to work with them.Hi, I’m Roos, a 27 year old fashion designer born in the Netherlands. I did a 4 year Bachelor in Fashion design and have a Master degree in Fashion Design. In between doing my 2 year masters degree I took a break and moved to Sweden to work as a design assistant for Acne Studios and H&M. After earning my Master’s degree I left to travel to Australia. Bondi Beach in Sydney caught my eye and stole my heart. For the last 3.5 years I have been working as a fashion designer for Australian brands SABA and JAG.Of course we’re aiming for success and if we reach our goal we will place the swimwear order straight away. Other product perks will be fulfilled in October 2017. Transparency is key so see below timeline to know what’s happening and when.As with every new product there can be risks and challenges in the manufacturing process. Through my work as fashion designer I have learnt how to eliminate as many errors as possible upfront. I will always keep you updated of new developments.Remember, I’ve got years of industry experience designing fashion.

Horyuji is therefore made with warmer colours of Slate and Oak wood to bring a peaceful feeling.

It shares partially the name of the mysterious stone heritage built over 1000 years ago in Cambodia. The semi rimless presentation shows its wild and extravagant characteristics. Early Bird Price: €109 / $119 • Save €111 / $119 off RRP Estimated Delivery: November 2017 Width: 152mm / Height: 58mm / Leg Length: 150mm / Bridge: 18mm  Inspired by the architectural style in which a single piece of work incorporates a mixture of elements from East & West to create designs that are new and original. Designs are influenced by the observations about Eastern heritages made of wood and Western ones made of stone. The durability of buildings with its relation to embody energy in technologies and materials has become an important feature of architecture, same as for our sunglasses.The high quality shale stone are cut into 1mm thick layers with a technology named Foliation. It has been widely used in Coal mining industry until it's brought to fashion industry lately in Germany.The slate layer is then combined with two high quality wood veneers under high pressure to form the frame. This structure makes our sunglasses more durable, more elastic, and not as easily broken as using a whole piece of wood.We use CNC machine to ensure the precision detail and it's the most eco-friendly way as it maximises yield of materials.Every pair of sunglasses is sanded with 3 different grades of sandpaper and coated with high quality wax.For the key of every optical products, lenses, we use Zeiss, one of the highest quality manufacturers of lenses in the world. All lenses are UV400(100% UVA/UVBA) with infused polarised filters, which highly protect your eyes under the sunlight.  Have you ever experienced sunglasses slipping down your nose? Or have a deep mark on the bridge of your nose after long term usage? It's because the sunglasses are too heavy. We usually don't feel it at the time we just put on the sunglasses, yet it caused us problems after we wearing the sunglasses for some time.You think it's okay cause the mark will fade away later on? NO! Continued usage of heavy spectacles will cause pigmentation. So.. yup, Slate Soul sunglasses solves it.   1. Materials Inspection. We inspect the slate and wood veneers in terms of smoothness, thickness, colour and the weight once we received them.2. Frame Test. After the frame is finished, we check the hinges, balance of the frame. We will proceed to lens assembly only if all parts are perfectly done.3. Quality Check. We basically check every details in this stage. Including the smoothness, the cleanness of the frames, etc. 15 Days return guaranteeWhile we manufacture our sunglasses to the highest standard of quality.  We understand that it may not be perfect fit to everyone. If you feel that the sunglasses doesn’t match your expectation, simply contact us and we will give you 100% refund in 15 days, start from the delivery date.1 Year Warranty We believe in quality of our products, so we back it up with 1 year warranty. If you experience any manufacturer defect within the first year, simply contact us and get our full back up. The reason why we set a stretch goal is because the Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) of Angkor is relatively high as it involves more procedures and parts than the other two models do. Once we hit $16,000, Angkor will be unlocked and we will send a survey to all backers who claimed our perks before for one time amendment.Wils Fabrik team is formed by 5 international young people across Europe and Asia.

This watch frankly breathes of elegance and is a perfect timepiece for the discreet person.On the back case of all our four models you see a dazzling silhouette of Stockholm – The Capital of Sweden - and a Swedish King pointing his sword towards The Church of Knights, in Swedish called ""Riddarkyrkan"". ""Riddarkyrkan"" is actually Stockholms oldest preserved building and also the church where all swedish monarhcs are buried by tradition.  The creation of Rumoe was under big influence of our Swedish lifestyle  Living in Sweden makes you accustomed to a high standard, which is why you always expect everything in society to spin like a wheel. Excellence, quality and beauty are common words among us Swedes and were obvious ingredients for our watch.   Stockholm City Hall - where the The Nobel Prize gala is held every year Another important ingredient is our noble history. The great Swedish King Gustaf II Adolf 
Sweden was once among the greatest war powers in Europe but the things we are most proud of is our long history of peace, our curiosity of the world around us and our sense of inventions. 
This heritage lives on among Swedes and is celebrated every year with the Nobel Prize

Alfred Nobel (1833-1896)
The name Nobel Royal is not just a tribute to the Swedish kings but also an honour to the greatest Swedish engineer ever: Alfred Nobel - he was, and still is, without any doubt one of our biggest prides abroad and a great ambassador for Stockholm and Swedish excellence.


The appereance of Rumoe was of greatest relevance but at least as important when designing Rumoe, was the quality. 

Rumoe Nobel Royal is equipped with Seiko Caliber NH35 automatic movement with 24 jewels and a power reserve of 41 hours.This work horse has a very smooth rotor and works quietly.
There are many benefits with an automatic watch but the fact that you don't need to use a battery is maybe the biggest advantage. Batteries can also sometimes cause fluid leakage, which can in the worst case scenario make vital parts rust. 
Seiko Caliber NH35 also offers - Hacking and Manual winding. 
 
 
Notice how the minute hand slides when using an automatic movement.
 

Rumoe is equipped with a butterfly clasp on all the models because of its great comfort and easy use.

All our straps are made out of calf leather. The calf leather itself is valuable because of its softness, fine grain, and durability.
We offer four different models:


Refresh your Rumoe with extra straps that are easy to change
 The buckle:

Unbuckled - Buckled


A watch isn’t just an item that tells time. It's also a precious accessory that should be taken good care of. That's why each Rumoe comes in a black, uncluttered box made out of high quality piano lacquered wood. 
Why a Rumoe watch? Let us tell You!

 We could make a long list but these are the most important benefits: 
I: Rumoe combines class with simplicity in design. You would be the owner of a luxurious timepiece!
II: No need for batteries with an automatic movement.Like most luxury watch brands, will Rumoe Nobel Royal also run purely on the natural movement of your arm. No need for batteries. You provide the energy! 
III: Quality, Safety and Security are key factors to us. During our voyage we have secured a manufacturing partner that we feel 100 % confident can always provide at the highest level. We offer our customers A TWO YEARS WARRANTY! 
IV: The affordability. A watch like ours would normally cost a lot more. We are able to keep the price low as there are no intermediaries. Your watch will be shipped to our factory in Sweden for a last quality control and then forwarded to you.  
We hope to get your trust & that you want to make a pledge. These would be the rewards: 
 



Why we think it's important for you as a backer to know that we are a registered trademark. If you do not register a trademark and there happens to be a registered owner of a similar mark, that owner will have an indefinite period of time to find us and sue us for infringement. In that case we must give up all profits earned by the use of the unregistered mark; and pay other damages, including punitive damages, fines, and attorneys' fees. For a start-up or a Kickstarter project that could potentially mean facing bankruptcy. 

This is why we have Exclusive Rights of the trademark 'Rumoe' so you can feel safe backing this project! 

Our ambition is that you will be a 100% satisfied. As you understand this is a high ambition and very hard to achieve in reality, but we are prepared. We take this very seriously and expect you to be satisfied when receiving your Rumoe. If you still find your Rumoe to be different from what was promised, we will refund or replace it.

 
 
Risks and challenges:
There are no risks as we see it - only one big challenge. Our intention is to have a 100% satisfaction rate.
We offer a two year warranty for your Rumoe. We have secured a first class supplier, who always delivers on time. We will remain open, transparent and keep you updated throughout the journey.
Welcome aboard and thank you for your support!",41.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>We are the “Outsider” team,</b> a group of people who are outdoor and water sports
enthusiasts and, most of all, active bikers enjoying a good ride on our
mountain and racing bikes. Together we have spent hundreds of hours working on
our bikes, optimizing and enhancing look and performance. Every passionate
biker seeks the optimal support of his or her bike. Trail seekers look for
stability, commuters want an easy and comfortable use, while racing cyclists
have sleepless nights over the best possible configuration of their lightweight
racing machines. Agreed, the requirements are multifaceted, as is the accessory
market trying to serve all those needs, nevertheless there are specific bike
parts, where no tangible progress seems to be made. Without being unfair, most
conventional spokes reflectors do their job, but all of them come with a
downside and there is not even an alternative for flat spokes or sport tires.
We all know that conventional spokes reflectors are heavy, bulky and
aerodynamic-wise, they are a millstone around one´s neck, respectively one´s
bike. They easily become useless in wet conditions and dirt. They get stolen,
they fall off, they break. And one thing is sure: They are anything but sleek
and stylish. That’s reflecting (no pun intended :-) the current market
situation and explains why cyclists do without spokes reflectors, although it
means a huge compromise from a safety perspective. <b>This realization

<h4><b><i>DO THEY REALLY WORK<em><i>?   <br/></i></em></i></b></h4>
<p><i>YES! Here is what customers are saying:</i><br/></p>
<ul>
<li><p><b><i>We tried EVERYTHING ~ Nothing worked until we found this!</i></b>  <i>This is 4 1/2 year old Zeuss. This is during a thunderstorm with his new ""pretty"" on. He has been scared to death for the last two Monsoons of the storms. We have tried the Thundershirt, Lavender mists, lavender sprayed on his bed and even prescription drugs. Nothing really allowed him to get to this level of comfort.....until this bandana!!! We didn't want to keep him drugged up with the prescription meds for the entire Monsoon season....this product is fantastic because it is around their neck with the calming scents that smell sooo good too. Thank you for such a great product!!! You have a new customer for life!!!! Reviewed by:  Charlie LaCross Cole from Phoenix, Arizona.  on 9/7/2014</i>    </p></li>
<li><p><b><i>Bogie tries to put it on all by himself</i></b><i>!</i>  <i>My Bogie LOVES his aromatherapy bandana, when it storms or there are firecrackers he will try to put his head in it on his own. Once on, he curls up in the nearest lap and is OUT, calm, sleepy and relaxed. Love this product! Reviewed by:  Barbara from Seminole.  on 9/4/2014</i></p></li>
<li><p><b><i>STORM BANDANA REVIEW</i></b><i>  Purchased one for my 5-yr old German Shepherd who is terrified of thunder storms. While I have to admit he is a bit of a ""Drama Queen,"" this product has brought him much needed relief. To see him stop shaking and crying after only a few minutes is wonderful. He's still afraid, but is able to handle the noise and pressure of the storm much better. We also have 2 cats who LOVE the fragrance coming from his bandana so much that they sit under his chin every time he has it on. The whole family of 4-legged friends benefits by this wonderful product. Thank you!!! on 8/15/2014</i></p></li>

<b><i>Worked     Great for Dog Aggression</i></b><i> The TLC scarf     works amazing. I am a dog trainer in Chicago and have been using the scarf     to help my aggression and anxiety cases. One case really stands out - the     dog had aggressive behaviors and anxiety towards one family member in     particular. Along with working with a veterinarian and adding the TLC     scarf to bring his anxiety level down the dog had major improvements. It     was the first time in 6 months that this family member had been in the     same room with the dog without any growling or aggression. This is a great     product!!!

<b><i>Anxiety     Bandana</i></b><i> I have a large dog that is     terrified of thunder. He has ruined 3 wooden doors trying to escape the     noise. A friend purchased one of these bandanas for my dog, and I won't be     without it. After monsoon season here in Tucson, when I went to remove the     bandana, he was really upset. He loves it. Really worth getting one of     these to comfort a nervous dog. Reviewed by: Winnie Baran from Tucson AZ.     on 7/1/2014</i>

<b><i>It     is ALL About Our Dogs &amp; Keeping Them Calm!</i></b><i>     Tara looks GORGEOUS in her storm bandana. She is such a good watchdog and     barks at thunder. From day 1 whenever it rains in Tampa (every day) I put     her bandana on and she calms down and stops. I love the smell of the herbs     as well! Last night the thunder woke her up I simply put on her bandana     and she went back to sleep and slept through the rain! THANK YOU THANK     YOU. I need to get more bandanas in different colors.

<b><i>THEY     REALLY WORK!</i></b><i> Mollie has been a very     nervous dog when it rains, thunders or anything else upsets her out of the     norm. Well, last weekends hail storm was a bad one in our area, I put her     bandana on and I am telling the truth when I say she calmed right down no     more shaking, panting, or needed me to hold her she curled up and was     calm. THEY REALLY WORK, i just ordered another one for her sister     Koko........... Pretty colors too, Mollie loved it Reviewed by: Sandy     English from Norfolk, Virginia. on 5/13/2014</i>

<b><i>Storm     Anxiety Bandana's are Amazing!</i></b><i> We've     tried numerous products for our mixed breed dog who starts to shake     uncontrollably when a thunderstorm starts to brew. As soon as we put the     bandana on her, she stopped shaking. Immediately. It was incredible. No     anxiety the whole thunderstorm. Can't thank you enough for finally     providing a product that calms her! Reviewed by: Paul K from Wesley Chapel,     Fl. on 3/30/2014</i>

<b><i>DOG     OWNER</i></b><i> We have a 100 lb. Labradoodle     who is petrified of storms. We picked up one of the Storm Bandanas this     past Sunday and got to put it to the test immediately, as we had a whole     day of thunderstorms on Monday. As usual, our dog Fenway began pacing,     hyperventilating and crying. Literally as soon as we put the storm bandana     around his neck, you could visually see him gradually calm down. The storm     bandana worked way beyond our expectations. We had tried the Thunder Shirt     in the past with no luck at all so we're thrilled that the storm bandana     worked as advertised!

<b><i>Works     Way Better Than the Thunder Shirt</i></b><i> I wanted     to let you know I have tried a thunder shirt and other items on my dog,     but the Storm Bandanna has been the only thing that works. I use it for     thunderstorms, fireworks, and long car rides. She tends to shake and pant     a lot, then when i put it on her, she calms down slowly. Many times falls     asleep. We have it in the same spot, and everyone in the house knows where     her ""thunder scarf"" is. Everyone needs one!! Reviewed by: Amanda     from Copley, OH 44321. on 3/10/2014 </i>

<b><i>Thought     My Dog Had Died</i></b><i> Brought home a bandana for     Sydney. As it turned out, a storm blew through that very night. She used     to shake like crazy from fear, but in her later years would just pant loud     enough to wake me up. So I got up, tied her calming bandana around her     neck, &amp; I'm not kidding - in five minutes there was no sound at     all...I thought she may have passed, because that had NEVER happened     before. Checked &amp; found her sleeping peacefully. The lightening     continued but the panting had stopped! I thought, ""No WAY"". This     bandana works. Thanks for an amazing product!

<p><i>If you 'google' Lavender, Chamomile, or Peppermint Dog, you will find much information on how all three of these herbs have been used to help calm anxiety. Through many hours of research I discovered that combining the 3 together produced an amazingly effective cord of defense, or 'triple whammy' for relieving pet fear &amp; anxiety; whether due to storms, fireworks, car rides, unfamiliar company, visits to the vet or groomer, or separation anxiety from the pet's owner(s).  When these 3 combined, essential herbal aromas travel through the pet's olfactory system, the brain's alpha waves increase, allowing the pet to be able to place 'scary' immediate thoughts like 'I don't understand! What's that loud noise?' or 'Oooh no, I don't like this car or that strange person in my house' , etc. in the background, while relaxation takes precedent. These allow pets to CHILL OUT naturally...

<h4>
<i>WHAT RISKS OR CHALLENGES DO YOU FEEL MAY HINDER YOU?</i><br/>
</h4>
<i>On a large scale I believe the biggest challenge lies in educating pet owners that their hope 
lies not in drugging their pets, but relieving their fears naturally. This may well require many infomercials &amp; concentrated target marketing efforts. ...  As far as immediate challenges - finding quality seamstresses who are as talented &amp; dependable as they claim to be. There is nothing difficult about my design, but I am very particular about quality control. Every bandana must look professional &amp; retail ready. Gathering the best team of workers is vital to my success, &amp; I have been blessed to have my original products still being sewn &amp; sold after a decade being in business, so overcoming obstacles &amp; moving forward is second nature to me at this point!</i><br/><p><br/></p>
<h4><i>I'M ON BOARD &amp; LOVE YOUR IDEA, BUT ALSO LACK FUNDS... SO?</i></h4>
<p><i>No worries! Welcome to my world, lol! Seriously, anything you can do simply to get the word out about these would be SO appreciated. Anyone can also just go online &amp; purchase one for their anxious pet, so please tell your friends who have dogs (or cats, or ponies, or husbands) with issues, thanks! <a href=""http://www.stormbandana.com./"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.stormbandana.com </a><br/></i></p>

WHERE DO YOU SEE THIS GOING & HOW ARE YOU GETTING THERE?

Ultimately, I desire a to take these world wide... the NEED for them is firmly established & the market is ripe! I currently lack the funds to take these to the level they need to be internationally... however, in reaching my goal here through Indiegogo, I will be able to hire the staff necessary to market & sell these through my current company, TLC in a greater, more concentrated way than I've been able to do so far ~ My goal is to place these in pet stores, green dog online stores, animal hospitals & rescues, etc. in every state in America - a very good foundation to build upon. I will produce these only as a 'Made in USA' product & look forward to bringing as much income to local workers as I possibly can.



WHAT RISKS OR CHALLENGES DO YOU FEEL MAY HINDER YOU?

On a large scale I believe the biggest challenge lies in educating pet owners that their hope 
lies not in drugging their pets, but relieving their fears naturally. This may well require many infomercials & concentrated target marketing efforts. ...  As far as immediate challenges - finding quality seamstresses who are as talented & dependable as they claim to be. There is nothing difficult about my design, but I am very particular about quality control. Every bandana must look professional & retail ready. Gathering the best team of workers is vital to my success, & I have been blessed to have my original products still being sewn & sold after a decade being in business, so overcoming obstacles & moving forward is second nature to me at this point!
I'M ON BOARD & LOVE YOUR IDEA, BUT ALSO LACK FUNDS... SO?
No worries! Welcome to my world, lol! Seriously, anything you can do simply to get the word out about these would be SO appreciated. Anyone can also just go online & purchase one for their anxious pet, so please tell your friends who have dogs (or cats, or ponies, or husbands) with issues, thanks! www.stormbandana.com

<p>In order
for human cells and organs to function properly, we need an adequate amount of
water in our bodies. Since nearly all activities cause people to lose water,
it's essential to replenish our water levels.</p>

QButton
posted on your cup helps to manage your drinking plan. It monitors the motion
of your cup and recommends you proper drinking time. If you have not drunk water in a
certain time, like an hour, it will remind you, by ringing a short piece of music gently in your mobile phone. 
<br/><br/><p>If you have, on the other hand, it will be quite, not like traditional alarm. QButton has a motion sensor in it so your cup knows when you have lift it up.</p>
<p>There are people drinking little water, because they are busy or just no such habit. When thirsty, it is already late for your body
to replenish water. We all know it takes 8 cups of water a day to maintain good health, it's simple yet easy to forget. </p>
<p>The scientific way of replenish water is to drink more often, not much a time, like drinking Chinese tea, it is very good for health. </p>

<h3><b>About Us</b></h3>
<p>We worked
for and accumulated rich experiences from great companies such as Intel,
Microsoft, Google, Cisco etc.  Now we team
up and represent QuickEmbed Technology Co., Ltd, a design house, providing customized
design services and solutions on embedded systems for about 10 years.
Just an example, we, together with ABM technology, a French company, had a
successful product launch of mPad in Europe recently, which is a convenient and
efficient device in banking for data processing and information collection.</p>
<h3><b>Why QButton?</b></h3>
<p>In today's
increasingly competitive society, the tempo of people's living is speeding up.
More and more people find it hard to adapt themselves to the fast pace of life.
With the enormous stress of fast living, people become more time-driven and
rushed than ever before. Some people are distressed by ""quick rhythm
syndrome"", which adversely affects the health psychologically and
physiologically.</p>
<p>We lost
ourselves, we forget good healthy habits, we don’t provide health tips to parents
and children. The health of us is at risk in the modern life.</p>
<p>We
definitely need to have a promising plan to improve our health and reduce the
pressure. How? We came to the idea of “QButton”, an interesting and efficient way
to help us to make best use of every simple thing, such as cups, chairs,
pillows, etc.  </p>
<p>We are
surrounded by the exciting wearable devices, but they are sometimes expensive
and not comfortable. With QButton, we do not need to wear anything.  It’s just like the intimate reminder from our
families and friends.  We can now easily
develop our own healthy habits and give tips to our beloved.  We decelerate the pace of life by the things
with QButton. They are around us, feeling us and embracing us.  We are not alone in the modern society with
Qbutton.</p>
<p>We hope
QButton will bring us an enjoyable way of healthy habits. We hope it will bring
us a healthier and brighter life by feeling the world and being nice to
ourselves.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left; font-weight: normal;"">SealDry makes fabric repel liquid rather than absorb it, and it doesn't affect the look or feel of fabric it's applied to. We’ve all had a favourite shirt ruined by an accidental juice spill, or a permanently stained couch after an overzealous wine-and-30 Rock night. Most of our team lives in Vancouver, so we're used to getting soaked in the rain. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Fabric is everywhere: our clothes, our homes, in the car, but as a material it has a flaw: it absorbs liquids. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left; font-weight: normal;"">SealDry is a spray-on superhydrophobic coating that uses nanotechnology to make fabric repel liquid rather than absorb it. When liquid comes into contact with fabric coated with
SealDry, it beads up and rolls right off the surface. </p>

<font><font>We've gotten SealDry this far in the lab, but now we need your help to get the product manufactured and get feedback on it in everyday use. The product was developed in the U.S, and will be manufactured and bottled in the U.S. When our project ends, we will have the product manufactured and shipped to a third-party bottling and fulfilment company, where it will be packaged and shipped out to our backers.

http://www.examiner.com/article/sealdry-will-change-the-traveler-world


SealDry makes fabric repel liquid rather than absorb it, and it doesn't affect the look or feel of fabric it's applied to. We’ve all had a favourite shirt ruined by an accidental juice spill, or a permanently stained couch after an overzealous wine-and-30 Rock night. Most of our team lives in Vancouver, so we're used to getting soaked in the rain. Fabric is everywhere: our clothes, our homes, in the car, but as a material it has a flaw: it absorbs liquids. 
SealDry is a spray-on superhydrophobic coating that uses nanotechnology to make fabric repel liquid rather than absorb it. When liquid comes into contact with fabric coated with
SealDry, it beads up and rolls right off the surface. 
Watch our videos to see it in action. Any questions? Want to get on our mailing list? john@sealdry.co




We're trying to raise $5,000 so that we can place the first production run of SealDry. That's the amount we have to sell to achieve scale and begin our bulk production and bottling. We've used flexible funding because if we miss our goal, we'll produce our perks bottles in the lab individually, so either way, you'll get your bottle of SealDry!


These are just a few of the things that you can protect with SealDry. We love hearing from people with creative and innovative ways to use it.



Protect shirts, pants, dresses and delicate, hard-to-clean garments



Protect shoes and boots from spills, rain and puddles. Treat your purse or bag to protect the contents from rain.

Protect car seats and carpet or motorcycle riding gear.


Protect your chairs, couch cushions, throw pillows and outdoor patio furniture.







Protect your placemats, tablecloths, gardening gloves, bedding and mattresses. 

Protect winter gloves and hats, backpacks, uniforms, tents and sleeping bags.





Protect your phone sleeve, laptop case, suitcase, overnight bag and toiletries.

As you can probably tell from the videos, this product has the potential to change the way you think about dozens of life's little problems. Caught in the rain? Spill coffee on your shirt at work? These are things that SealDry protects against.


We've gotten SealDry this far in the lab, but now we need your help to get the product manufactured and get feedback on it in everyday use. The product was developed in the U.S, and will be manufactured and bottled in the U.S. When our project ends, we will have the product manufactured and shipped to a third-party bottling and fulfilment company, where it will be packaged and shipped out to our backers. We set a very safe goal, to deliver by March 2014, but we are aiming to ship out all of the perks in less than half of the 3 months we've allowed. As a rule, it's always best to under-promise and over-deliver. Once you've used the product in your everyday life, we'll send out a follow-up email for some feedback, which we hope you'll provide.




After months of experimenting with different solvents and concentrations, we developed a formula that doesn't affect the look or feel of the fabric, and is cost effective. Then we went to work developing a more expensive formula that achieved even better results. Since the cost of the stronger formula is high, we decided to offer both.




For maximum strength SealDry, we double the concentration of the active ingredient, for a coating that provides even stronger liquid repellence than Original SealDry. This formulation costs more to produce so it's offered at a higher price. Everything in our videos was coated with Maximum Strength SealDry. 



Testing Various Formulations
 


When SealDry is sprayed onto fabric and dries, silica nano particles ranging from 2 to 200 nanometers are assembled together in clusters on the fibers of the fabric. To give that scale some perspective, a single human hair is about 60,000 nanometers in diameter.  To learn more about how incredibly small these particles are, check out this very neat tool that allows you to see the scale of everything: http://htwins.net/scale2/

</div></div>","We started asking ourselves: What do Lotus drivers want if they could re-design the keys themselves?



We believe most Lotus drivers want something EXOTIC that can represent themselves as well as their cars.  
It all started out with the ugly looking OEM key that came with the car (S2 Elise/Exige). The idea is to the combine the factory key with alarm fob in one beautifully designed housing that goes with the style of Lotus. 

After months of research and design, we came up with this unique product, Unikey. 



On July, 2012, we started the first batch of our V.1 Unikeys. We received numerous positive feedbacks from our customers. The topic soon became one of the highest participated for sale topics on Lotustalk forum. 
On October 2012, shortly after our first batch, we released our V.2 Unikeys. The batch was sold out quickly and we ended the production.
