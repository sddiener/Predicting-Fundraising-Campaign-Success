<p>Thank you so much for checking out our campaign.  We are raising funds to finish our new album, <strong>“Champions of the Universe”</strong> and to help us take it to the <strong>next level.</strong> </p>
<p>For those of you who don’t know us, we are <strong><a href=""http://www.ratboyjr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ratboy Jr.</a></strong> and we play music for families. We used to say kids’ music, but some parents told us, “Hey we love your music just as much as they do!”  So, we play music for kids, adults, and everyone in between.  Some call it “Kindie music”, which is independent music for children.  We are very independent indeed.</p>
<p>So independent, in fact, that we handmade every single copy of our last album, Smorgasbord.  </p>
<p>This last album brought us all over the Northeast.  We opened for Levon Helm and played at such festivals as Mountain Jam (NY), The Green River Festival (MA), Top of the Park (MI), The LEAF Festival (NC), Clearwater Festival (NY), The River Meltdown (MA), and many more.</p>
<p>Why are we telling you all this?  We are ready to take it to the next level.  We have gotten so far and we need help to go even further.  We can’t keep making the CDs by hand. This next album is going to be so amazing that it deserves to look and sound the best it can.</p>
<h2><strong>The Next Level</strong></h2>
<p>We are currently finishing up our second album, “Champions of the Universe.”  We recorded most of it with our good friend Dean Jones from <a href=""http://www.dogonfleas.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dog on Fleas</a>, our most favoritest band in all of the land.  He has an incredible hay bale studio in Rosendale, NY called <a href=""http://www.dogonfleas.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">No Parking Studio</a>.  We also recorded some of it in Woodstock, NY at our friend’s studio, <a href=""http://tuttlesoundlabs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tuttle Sound Lab</a>s. </p>
<p>We can honestly say this is the best music we have ever written and the best cover art we have ever been involved with! We had our artist pal, <a href=""http://cronartusa.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ryan Cronin</a> paint us the most awesome cover we could possibly imagine.  We have come so far and we need your help to go even further.  Just imagine what we could do with a proper album.</p>
<h2><strong>Your Level</strong></h2>
<p>Here is where you come in.  Here is some of what we still need to do:</p>
<p><strong>Mixing- </strong>This is where we adjust all the levels of the msuic to make it sound great.  Timmy says the vocals need to be louder and Matty says the Drums need to be louder and then we meet in the middle.  </p>
<p><strong>Mastering</strong>- This is when someone takes the songs and makes them sound like they are ready for the radio.  We could not afford this last time and these songs want to be heard!</p>
<p><strong>Print the CD-</strong> We want to have the CDs professionally duplicated.  Our hands hurt just thinking about making them ourselves.  The cover is so amazing and we want it to look fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>Banner-</strong> We play a lot of festivals and we want to get a cool banner that says our name.</p>
<p><strong>We are trying to raise $2,000.  </strong>This money will go directly toward helping us take it to the next level.  If we raise more then $2,000 we might make to the next, next level.  We can get T-shirts, a website, music vdoes, etc.  If we don’t raise the full $2,000 we still keep what we raise!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We have some cool perks for helping us out. </strong> We can’t thank you enough, but we can give you <strong>STUFF! </strong></p>
<p>If you can’t contribute to our campaign, you can still help us get the word out.  You can use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p>Thank you so much in advance, Timmy and Matty </p></div>","The First Level

</p><p>WE WILL BE DOING A SERIES OF VIDEOS FEATURING SHEVIL BASSIST PJ DUNPHY PROMOTING THIS GLORIOUS GOAL WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE THROUGH YOU, OUR CHILDREN!<br/><br/></p>
<h3>SHEVIL</h3>
<p>We're the world's only 3 bassed epic doom band!  We consist of vocalist/bassist Kyle McDonald, bassist Shaun Crawford, bassist PJ Dunphy and drummer Errol Girvan.  Vocally we express a melodic approach laced with some darker/aggressive tendencies. <br/><br/>We have collectively played in a ton of bands over the years, featuring The Monoxides, Iron Giant, The Peter Parkers, Gallactus, Cop Shades, MANLORD, Blood Royal and many more.<br/><br/>To date we've released an EP, and toured from St. John's, Newfoundland to Toronto, Ontario having played with bands the likes of Cauldron, C'mon, sHEAVY, Electric Magma, and Wizards Of Kaos to name a handful.<br/><br/></p>

Now, almost 10 years sober and musically recharged with an acoustic style all his own, Hammer is sparing for change with a worthwhile purpose — to create his next studio CD.</p>
<p>With a fresh batch of songs that have fans singing along at shows throughout Minnesota, Hammer is eager to head back into the studio to create the follow-up to 2008’s “Tattooed Folk EP.” Many have been asking, “So when’s the new CD coming out?” The answer is always, “As soon as I can afford to do it justice.” Well, now’s your chance to help make the new disc happen!</p>
<p>This new album, tentatively titled “Broken Like You,” will feature a dozen or so new songs that require more studio treatment than Hammer can give at his home-based Hammered House Productions where the “Tattooed Folk EP” was recorded and produced.</p>

<p>Along with the full-length, Hammer also will be releasing the “Let it Burn EP” with his band the Impact featuring some of his darker, drop-tuned cuts (“Let it Burn,” “Whistle Your Way to the Grave” and a new rendition of “Ballad of Lucy”) that just don’t fit in with the music pegged for “Broken Like You.”</p>

<h3>The Band</h3>
<p>Hi,we're Supermajor! We're a group of music-slinging friends who started playing together in late 2008, united by a love of big choruses, spine-tingly vocal harmony, and laser sounds. In late 2009, we recorded and self-released our first EP, and we've been rocking it on stages nationwide since then. We've come a long way in the past few years, and now we're ready to share more of the music we love to play with the world!</p>
<h3>The EP</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Since the last record, we've gone through some changes and discovered musical hair in places we never had musical hair before. We've been melting faces from here to St. Louis (literally), and have emerged, butterfly-like, from this rock 'n' roll chrysalis with a collection of songs we think are going to touch your very soul...or, at least, your soul's chocolatey outer shell.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Your Money Pays For</h3>
<p>Magic and unicorns! And if we have any left over, we'll use it to pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio time!</li>
<li>The recording work of our excellent producer, John Gideon!</li>
<li>Mixing!</li>
<li>Mastering!</li>
<li>Reproduction and printing of a whole bunch of discs!</li>
<li>The biggest publicity push we can muster once the record is done so that everyone and their mom has the chance to enjoy it!</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Donate</h3>

At the end of the campaign, we'll send an e-mail to all donors listing the rewards for which you qualify, and you can let us know what you'd like to receive! IT'S EASY IT'S FAST ZOMG.</p>
</div>
<h3>What You Can Get</h3>
<p>First and foremost, our undying love and devotion. But, on top of that, we have a whole list of shwag over there on the right just waiting to be claimed. Copies of the record, special exclusive artwork and merchandise, services only available to contributors, and more!

It's <em><strong>Jazz Noir</strong></em>! Come on a journey....back in time and experience the sultry and steamy world of a torch singing femme fatal and the private detective who is drawn in like a moth to a flame.... jazz, pulp fiction and film noir .... a sordid story with a twist, a turn and a few more twists .... all backed by a 20 piece orchestra.The greatest songs of the era will be performed live and will be woven into a story line that will be enhanced and embellished with live and video imagery.</p>
<p>Working with some of the top jazz arrangers and musicians and having a fan following of my own in the Los Angeles area, my initial goal will be to produce a full concert in front of a live audience that will be video taped and edited into an electronic press kit (EPK). The ultimate goal will be to submit the EPK  to booking agents and buyers at the major Performing Arts Centers across the U.S and around the world, with the idea of not only booking a tour of the original production, but to also create a license-able commodity for additional production companies in the future. </p>
<p>The funds will be used to rent the venue; the multimedia elements (screens, projectors, etc.); the sound and lighting equipment; hire and rehearse the orchestra; hire a video crew to shoot and edit a performance EPK; pay for any licenses required for the multimedia portion of the production; pay for any marketing costs to promote the performance and; even though the arrangements and scores for the music are almost completed, there may be additional costs in those areas.   </p>

<p>Hello, lovely people! ;-) Chantae Cann here... I'm an independent singer/songwriter based out of Atlanta, GA, and as far as I can remember, music has ALWAYS been my LOVE.  I decided to PURSUE it with PASSION and have since been blessed with the AMAZING opportunity to sing as a professional backing vocalist for Grammy Award winning artist, India.Arie.  This has been a DREAM come true!  I've encountered a plethora of equally as breathtaking, opportunities to collaborate with some of the most INSPIRING artists &amp; musicians in the music industry.  In 2008, I began branching out into my solo artistry and I am finally ready to release an OFFICIAL debut project! ;-)</p>
<p>As an independent artist, in can be disheartening when one of the major factors prohibiting you from having a finished quality project is...yup...you guessed it... SWEET MULA!  So I'm reaching out to my beloved supporters, encouragers &amp; appreciators to let you all know that, FIRST and foremost, I appreciate the appreciation! SECONDLY, I have been working on something very special &amp; from the heart for you guys, and NOW, more than ever, I need your support. I humbly extend the invitation to each of you all, that can and will, to consider becoming a part of this meaningful process.               </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>My Mission</h3>
<p>""I sing because I LOVE to.  I sing because God has entrusted me with a gift purposed to CHANGE the WORLD one melody at time. I sing to HELP. I sing to HEAL. I sing to COMFORT. I sing to LIBERATE. I sing to APPRECIATE. I sing to MOTIVATE.  I sing to RELEASE. I sing to EXPRESS. I sing because, honestly, It's what I was MADE to do!"" ;-) </p>
<div><span> </span></div>
<h3><span>Cheese, Please!</span></h3>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div>
<span>My team-members at over at <strong>Love Heals Music</strong> and I, are aiming to raise <strong>$20,000</strong> in order to finance the launch &amp; release of my debut solo music project scheduled to release in late SPRING of 2013.  A</span><span>t first glance, $20, 000 may LOOK like a lot. ...Heck, at 2nd, 3rd &amp; 4th glance TOO, I know!  However, i</span><span>t is our sole intention to bring you all the best of the best, in EVERY capacity.  The calibre of artistry &amp; musicianship that we intend to present, with your help, will turn out to be one exquisite listening journey.  </span>
</div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<h3><span>Where's Your Cheddar Going?</span></h3>
<p>Here's a breakdown of what the funds raised will go towards.</p>
<p><strong>$10,000</strong> - Major Recording Expenses ((Studio Time, Musicians, Producer/Engineer            Fees, Mixing/Mastering))</p>
<p><strong>$3,000</strong> - Photo/Video Shoot &amp; Edit for Website Launch &amp; Promo Use</p>

<p> </p></div>","My Story
Hello, lovely people! ;-) Chantae Cann here... I'm an independent singer/songwriter based out of Atlanta, GA, and as far as I can remember, music has ALWAYS been my LOVE.  I decided to PURSUE it with PASSION and have since been blessed with the AMAZING opportunity to sing as a professional backing vocalist for Grammy Award winning artist, India.Arie.  This has been a DREAM come true!  I've encountered a plethora of equally as breathtaking, opportunities to collaborate with some of the most INSPIRING artists & musicians in the music industry.  In 2008, I began branching out into my solo artistry and I am finally ready to release an OFFICIAL debut project! ;-)
As an independent artist, in can be disheartening when one of the major factors prohibiting you from having a finished quality project is...yup...you guessed it... SWEET MULA!  So I'm reaching out to my beloved supporters, encouragers & appreciators to let you all know that, FIRST and foremost, I appreciate the appreciation! SECONDLY, I have been working on something very special & from the heart for you guys, and NOW, more than ever, I need your support. I humbly extend the invitation to each of you all, that can and will, to consider becoming a part of this meaningful process.               
 
My Mission
""I sing because I LOVE to.  I sing because God has entrusted me with a gift purposed to CHANGE the WORLD one melody at time. I sing to HELP. I sing to HEAL. I sing to COMFORT. I sing to LIBERATE. I sing to APPRECIATE. I sing to MOTIVATE.  I sing to RELEASE. I sing to EXPRESS. I sing because, honestly, It's what I was MADE to do!"" ;-) 
 
Cheese, Please!
 

My team-members at over at Love Heals Music and I, are aiming to raise $20,000 in order to finance the launch & release of my debut solo music project scheduled to release in late SPRING of 2013.  At first glance, $20, 000 may LOOK like a lot. ...Heck, at 2nd, 3rd & 4th glance TOO, I know!  However, it is our sole intention to bring you all the best of the best, in EVERY capacity.  The calibre of artistry & musicianship that we intend to present, with your help, will turn out to be one exquisite listening journey.  

 
 
Where's Your Cheddar Going?
Here's a breakdown of what the funds raised will go towards.
$10,000 - Major Recording Expenses ((Studio Time, Musicians, Producer/Engineer            Fees, Mixing/Mastering))
$3,000 - Photo/Video Shoot & Edit for Website Launch & Promo Use
$3,000 - Manufacture/Replication of Physical CD's ((Includes Album Artwork & Graphic Design))
$3000 - Professional PR Services
$500   - Website Launch & Design
$500   - Promo Gear ((Posters, T-Shirts, Hoodies, Fanny Packs, etc...))
 
 
***Any ADDITIONAL funds raised will go towards small tour start up costs, in addition to the launching of our affiliate Not for Profit Organization, also known as, The Love Heals Movement***
 

 

Cool Stuff for YOU!
 
Point blank..If you give money, you will get stuff. The cooler the money, the cooler the stuff.  I think that principle is pretty much universal but don't quote me on those statistics. Please refer to the list of PERKS located on the very RIGHT of this page -->> This way -->> Yup, that's it, keep going -->> You're almost there -->> Destination PERKVILLE arrived! ;-)    
 

 Every Bit Helps

 Whether, you can give a gazillion fafillion dollars ((wink, wink)) ...orrr, not QUITE that amount, we want you to know that we will accept every penny with a smile.  Every bit helps get us one step closer to our goal ;-)

</p><h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Kyla Simone. I have been surrounded by music my entire life but it was a special gift of my first guitar on Christmas day, 2005 from my mom that unlocked my passion to share music on a more professional level.</p><p>Over the last few years God has inspired me to write a grouping of real-life experience based songs which was an outlet for me to process internally, but also to be eventually share with others who can relate to the messages.</p><p>""FlySoar"" the EP is all about pursuing our dreams but with a mind bent on doing life God's way.  This campaign was designed to help me reach my goal of completing this EP as well as shooting my first ever music video to the song ""Pride"" which released in late January 2014.  I have been in talks with an amazing video company and the vision is there, we just need the finances to make it happen.</p><p>I desire to produce music that is heartfelt, filled with truth and inspiring, but quality and professionally done.  The hardest part of this process is to have all this bottled creativity and lack one of the things that matters most from a business standpoint, money.  I am independant and have invested so much into my dream but I simply can't realistically do this alone.  The easy thing to do is to just throw in the towel and move on to another pursuit, however the brave thing to do is to continue to fight. This is what I have decided to do.</p><p>So in a nutshell, your support  will allow me to accomplish so much. I will be able to complete my EP Project ""FlySoar"" with one of the most eclectic producers I have ever had the pleasure of working with, Charles Foster of the Dudley's B. Sharp Music Studio. I will also be able to film my first ever music video to my debut single ""Pride"", and your support will also help in the printing and distribution of the EP once it is complete.  This support means the entire world to me, you have no idea!</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to raise a total of $6000.  Let me break things down a bit.  The first $3500 will go directly towards the cost of production, mixing, mastering, printing, the promotion of my ""FlySoar"" EP, and lastly a percentage will be donated towards 2 special causes which I will explain in just a moment.  The remaining $2500 will go directly to the video production company to film my music video to ""Pride.""  Every penny will be used to complete these two projects plus further our passion for outreach.</p><p>My producer Charles and I have both decided to split and donate 10% of the funds raise to 2 causes we believe in.  Charles' cause is Gospel for Asia's Bridge of Hope which provides education, food, medical care, and other resources to children and their families in Asian regions.  I will be donating my half to the Virtuous Girls Mentoring Program which is a monthly creative arts and life skills program designed for middle school and high school girls right here in the DMV.  They also host in conjunction with Soul La Femme, Inc. an annual LifeArts Girls Dayshop which takes the same concept but provides a full day of fun and challenging activities and hands on learning experiences for tween and teen girls.  So your support will benefit more than just my project, but the lives of today's young people abroad and right here at home.</p><p>In return I am delighted to provide some wonderful perks which serve as my token of gratitude for your love and support of my ministry.  My gifts to you cover everything from a complimentary copy of my new single ""Pride"", to exclusive ""FlySoar"" merchandise, an exclusive invitation to the private pre-screening of ""Pride"" the music video before it officially releases to the public, and a special signed copy of my ""FlySoar"" EP one week before it hits the stores.<br/></p><ul></ul><p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am believing that this project will truly make everyday men and women, young and old realize that they are not alone and that there is hope.  This project is intended to reach the furthest ends of the world and impact people in a way that produces forward movement and an interest in knowing more about Christ and how to live for Him instead of simply for ourselves.  I am hopeful that this and my future projects will change the world someday.  We all hurt, bleed, have dreams, and most of all need more...aka God.</p><ul></ul><p></p>

<p><strong>F*** Cancer</strong></p>
<p>Seriously...</p>
<p>Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, in 2008, cancer accounted for 7.6 million fatalities (around 13% of all deaths). In Orange, California, <a href=""http://www.giveforward.com/fundraiser/vd31/supportkikiscancerfund"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">8 year old Kiki Havivy</a> is fighting a nearly impossible battle to not be included in that statistic.</p>
<p>Thankfully, she is not fighting alone.</p>
<p>A group of almost 40 perfect strangers have come together in a random act of kindness to save this little girl. Since October 2012, this group has been hard at work producing an album to benefit Kiki and others like her. With your help, we can make this happen and possibly save some lives in the process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Producing an album, even for charity, can quickly run up a hefty tab. Although we have done everything we can to minimize the overhead of the album, there are still a few unavoidable debts that we have to cover. Such as: the cost for CDs and Vinyls ($6,500), art prints and shipping ($200), legal fees ($75/hr) and many other costs. </p>
<p>If you decide to donate to our project, we will make sure that your investment will be worthwhile. In addition to gaining some really good karma, you'll receive some pretty awesome stuff with each donation. We have some great things to give away as a ""thank you"" for making this project possible.</p>
<p><strong>Before you decide to donate</strong> to our cause, we encourage you to donate something to the family that we are doing this to benefit. We would like to see Kiki get the help she needs sooner rather than later. So please, if you are conflicted between donating to us or donating to Kiki's Recovery Fund, we implore you to go <a href=""https://secure.giveforward.com/donate/33072/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> and donate to the original recovery effort instead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Reaching our goal</strong></p>
<p>If we <strong>don't</strong> reach our goal in time, the money raised will be split evenly. 50% will go to the Havivy family for Kiki and 50% will go to the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation.</p>
<p>If we <strong>do</strong> reach our goal in time, then we will be able to press and ship our initial order of 1,000 CDs and 500 vinyl LPs. If every physical unit is sold, then we will be able to raise over $30,000 for Kiki and other cancer patients worldwide!</p>
<p>If we <strong>exceed</strong> our goal before time is up, half of every $100 donation (or 50% of every $100) we receive will be split between: <strong>CURE Childhood Cancer, Inc.</strong> and <strong>Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Our campaign is based on a very simple model: make music &gt; raise money &gt; cure cancer. Your donation can turn this model into something very real. Let's work together and help many children who need it the most.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Help make our campaign a success and you will be making a massive difference in the lives of many children afflicted with cancer. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Times are tough, we totally get it!  However, you don't just have to donate to help, because there is another big way that you can help our cause.</p>
<p>Making a whole lot of noise about this project can be one of the best ways to help us get funded. So, tell your friends, family, coworkers, teachers, random people on the streets, tell anyone and everyone what we are doing. This will help us, Kiki, and so many more that need it.</p>

male a cappella group that has taken form over the last 6 months here in
Bellingham. The members, Aidan Glaze, AJ Russo, Hunter Dunn, Ian Slater, and
Luke Robinson originally came together back in April of 2013 simply to put
together an a cappella song to sing for their school talent show (they are all
seniors and juniors at Bellingham High School). However, due somewhat to the
outstanding popularity of the performance at the talent show, they decided to continue
performing and start Bellingham's newest a cappella band, Chief of Staff. All
sharing a deep passion for music, and a cappella especially, Chief of Staff
wanted to have more chances to perform that style of music for people around
the community. Over the summer, Hunter Dunn and Aidan Glaze spent a lot of time
creating their own arrangements of songs from many different genres including
titles such as Maroon 5's ""She Will Be Loved"", Dobie Gray's
""Drift Away"", and ""Fix You"" by Coldplay, so that when fall
arrived, they had a solid set of performance-ready songs. They have recently
started work on their first album (as yet untitled), and they hope to release
it in the next few months, but have released a single - Fix You - that is
available for anyone who wants to get a sense of their sound. At the end of
2013 Chief of Staff won the Kafe 104.1 ""Stars of Christmas"" contest,
and received a $1000 prize for their school's music department with a cover of
""Indiana Christmas"" written by the kings of a cappella, Straight No
Chaser. As they continue work on their album, they are ever in search of venues
to perform music at. If anyone would like to hire Chief of Staff for any event,
they can reach them at bhschiefofstaff@gmail.com. Currently they are
self-recording and producing, yet hope with the proceeds from concerts and
music sales to soon be able to afford professional studio recording.</p>
<p>Aside from being members of Chief
of Staff, every member of the group is a talented musician in his own right.
Hunter Dunn is proficient at many instruments including piano and guitar, Ian
Slater is an amazing cellist who, with his instrumental quartet, Raisin Brahms,
won the State Solo and Ensemble Competition, Luke Robinson has been in lead
roles in Musical Productions at the 5th Avenue Theatre in Seattle, AJ Russo is
a fabulous singer/songwriter and guitar player who has released his own EP, and

<p>Hey All,</p>
<p>Earthquakes and Butterflies. Sound like life? Yep. Heartwrenching, beautiful, epic, personal, terrifying, joyful, tender, funny, passionate and ultimately indescribable. That's why for me the vibrations of sound best capture the full spectrum of feelings that come with being human. Through all the 'Earthquakes and Butterflies' of my own life, I've done my best to be honest in the journey. In these songs, I'm sharing my fears, joys, dreams and sorrows with you. I hope that in listening to this music you will be touched deeply, and share with me the amazing experience of being fully alive.</p>
<p>I also know that we have the ability to 'morph our dreams' as we go, and like the butterfly symbolizes, transcend our deepest fears into the truest reality we can imagine for ourselves! That's why I'm calling this project, Morphic Dream. The symbol for my project is a human butterfly, and represents wholeness.</p>
<p>I have an extensive background in music composition and orchestration, performing, recording and teaching music in multiple genres..so, it' no mistake that this album is a genre-defying kaleidescope of electro-acoustic pop, rock, tantalizing beats and quirky classical orchestration. For a sample of songs that are on the album go to: <a href=""http://www.sonicbids.com/morphicdream"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sonicbids.com/morphicdream</a>. The Apple and Eve video featured here in the indegogo gallery is the only all acoustic song on the EP.</p>
<p>I've paid alot out of pocket to record, mix and master nearly 1/2 of this album, and  $7,000 more is required to finish it, pay a graphic designer and print the CD's. Any extra funding I raise will go towards creating a top-notch website that is being constructed right now. So, THANKS FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART for your contribtions and support, in all forms and ways.

Earthquakes and Butterflies. Sound like life? Yep. Heartwrenching, beautiful, epic, personal, terrifying, joyful, tender, funny, passionate and ultimately indescribable. That's why for me the vibrations of sound best capture the full spectrum of feelings that come with being human. Through all the 'Earthquakes and Butterflies' of my own life, I've done my best to be honest in the journey. In these songs, I'm sharing my fears, joys, dreams and sorrows with you. I hope that in listening to this music you will be touched deeply, and share with me the amazing experience of being fully alive.
I also know that we have the ability to 'morph our dreams' as we go, and like the butterfly symbolizes, transcend our deepest fears into the truest reality we can imagine for ourselves! That's why I'm calling this project, Morphic Dream. The symbol for my project is a human butterfly, and represents wholeness.
I have an extensive background in music composition and orchestration, performing, recording and teaching music in multiple genres..so, it' no mistake that this album is a genre-defying kaleidescope of electro-acoustic pop, rock, tantalizing beats and quirky classical orchestration. For a sample of songs that are on the album go to: www.sonicbids.com/morphicdream. The Apple and Eve video featured here in the indegogo gallery is the only all acoustic song on the EP.
I've paid alot out of pocket to record, mix and master nearly 1/2 of this album, and  $7,000 more is required to finish it, pay a graphic designer and print the CD's. Any extra funding I raise will go towards creating a top-notch website that is being constructed right now. So, THANKS FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART for your contribtions and support, in all forms and ways. In sharing this music with the world, I offer the best of my most authentic and true self and life experiences. Thank you for helping me EMPOWER this DREAM!!

<p></p></div>","Who are the T Sisters?The T Sisters are three real sisters--Erika, Rachel and Chloe Tietjen.  We've been singing and making music our whole lives, but 4 or 5 years ago we began writing and playing together in earnest.  Following our first EP in 2011, we've brought together 12 of our songs, all originals except one, to create our first full-length album.  This album is our chance to take these songs and, supported by a team of talented musicians and industry professionals, craft each one into its strongest form.  This fundraising campaign will give supporters the opportunity to bring to life a strong and vibrant collection of songs, and give shape to this sister trio's artistic visions.  We hope that this album will help to launch our careers as full-time artists, working collaboratively in our sisterhood!We're making an album and we need help! Here's where the funds will go.In order to transform each song into the best version of itself, we hired a tremendously talented team of musicians, a fantastic producer, super qualified engineers and a top notch graphic designer/photographer.Here is a rough breakdown of our costs:

$13,000- Recording/Production/Mixing/Mastering/CD Art and Design: Includes studio musician fees, airfare for hired musicians, recording studio rental, studio engineer fees, producer fees, mixing engineer fees, mastering engineer fees, and album artwork fees. Holy cow! 


$3000- Mass production printing our first run of the CD + shipping + tax

$1050- indiegogo/ Amazon fees 
$300- Copyright/publishing fees 
$3000- Promotion
As you can see, our total costs are more than what we're asking. If we exceed our goal, those funds will go towards additional promotion and towards making a killer vid!For your generosity we've imagined up a host of fun rewards!

</h3> <p>Hello and thank you for taking the time to check out our campaign.</p>
<p>I am Rafael Montero, and I speak on behalf of my brothers to give you a general idea of what we are doing.</p>
<p>My brother Daniel started the whole concept for Montero. He actually is the driving force of this band. My brother David and I consider Daniel to be a musical genious, and I'll tell you why that is. When he was just a little baby kid, he would make sounds with his mouth and it suddenly hit us that he was beat boxing to the rhythm of the songs. When he was 4, my father bought us a keyboard and I would sit at it and try to play the songs that were in it, and my Daniel joined me and started to play the songs then and there. Fast forward 20 years and without any real musical training, Daniel can recreate songs, instrument by instrument just by hearing the song and he can play them on his keyboard and make musical arrangements like they were the easiest thing in the world.</p>
<p>But my little bro had an idea in his mind, he wanted to make something with his brothers. And he approached me for helping him write songs, since for the longest time, one of my passions has been creative writing, but working on a song with Daniel has been one of the most fun things I've ever done.</p>
<p><b>When did this all start?</b><br/></p>
<p>Daniel became one of the judges for a musical talent show for his college last year, and there, he meet two producers, Julián Cerrillo and Bruno Barrera, heads of One Take Records. They saw what Daniel could do and offered him the chance to record music with them. When we got to the studio for the first time, we instantly clicked with Julián and Bruno and became great friends and they are very invested in our work. So much so, that they have been doing their hard work almost for free. But, in order to keep doing this we need help. Because for the completion of this project, the expenses are big.</p>
<p>We are from Monterrey, Mexico, and one of the things we've noticed from fellow artists here is that they seldom or never really do work in english. Some latin american artists do, but most mexican artists don't. So we thought it would be great, to launch an album that had english and spanish songs. It's an album ranging from Pop to Rock and also rock and pop ballads. But we don't want to make dumb pop songs that repeat a single verse over and over, we want to put lyrics that everyone can enjoy but also complex enough to not bore.<br/></p>
<b>What you will help us accomplish with the funding</b><br/>You will help us to take the first step into the world of music and help us also materialize Daniel's and our Dream, to become Artists and bring our music to everyone we can.<br/>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Mizzerables are Joe Mizzi, Adam Instefjord, Dave Vazzano, and Korey Brisendine. We have all been or are in a number of bands including Common Rider, Ten Ninety, About the Mess, Searching for Sunlight, Lights Alive, and Bottle Kids. I, Joe, also run a record label called Whoa! Records that releases independent recordings by underground acts of the punk/indie variety. Because a lot of my cashflow is tied up in releases for the label, money for my own band is tight. We are working on recording our debut full length, and are turning to our fans, friends, and family for help. Essentially this campaign allows you to pre-order a number of items related to the release, and that helps us understand the cashflow we will have on hand to get everything done. Will it get done anyway? Rest assured, it will.</p>
<p>So have a look around, and make a pledge if you can, we truly appreciate every dollar we get towards helping us complete this record. You can get a preview of what (may) appear on the album by going to <a href=""http://themizzerables.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://themizzerables.com</a>. You can stream some tunes or download them by joining our mailing list. If you would like to know what it really takes to get an independent record done, here is a break down of our estimated costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking - $3,500</li>
<li>Mixing - $1,000</li>
<li>Mastering - $1,000</li>
<li>Equipment - $1,000</li>
<li>CD Pressing - $1,000</li>
<li>Vinyl Pressing - $2,500</li>
</ul>
<p>Total: <em><strong>$10,000</strong></em>.</p>
<p>These costs are pretty low comparitively speaking because we have our own studio, and our engineer (Adam) will be doing this for a heavily discounted rate. Any money we raise will be used in the order above to help cover costs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are looking to raise as much as we can towards getting the project done. We certainly don't have the following, being so new, to raise the entire cost, but any little bit will help us avoid piling up debt to get the project done.</li>
<li>We are offering advanced copies of the album, physical copies of the ablum, t-shirts, stickers, and other items in return for pledges. We are also offering private concerts and free tickets to our shows.</li>
<li>Every penny we raise will go towards the release. The more we raise, the more we will be able to do (i.e. more t-shirt designs, better packaging, etc.).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By making a pledge, you will help us make more music, and that makes us extremely happy and we owe a debt to everyone who has and does help us along the journey. We all have something we are passionate about, making music is ours.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you cannot make a donation. Please consider sharing our campaign on your facebook or twitter feeds. Spreading the word can be very difficult (and costly), but with social media, we all are able to make a small dent and save each other a few bucks in spreading the word about our various endevours. There are plenty of sharing tools attached to this campaign to make it easy.</p>
<p>Also, you can sign up for our mailing list at <a href=""http://themizzerables.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://themizzerables.com</a> to get updates on what we are doing, where we are playing, and discount offers once the album comes out.</p>

</h3></div>","In Chicago there is a recording studio owned by Steve Albini. The people who frequent the music forum associated with this studio (www.electricalaudio.com/phpBB3/) have been organising musical events for some years now where nice people can get together and hear brilliant bands, the sort of bands that live the punk ideal to the max and would rather die than sell out. These people are committed to quality and are all special in their own various ways. In another age they would be gods. Chicago is not in the UK or even in Europe. Many of us cannot afford to go there and anyway there are bands more local to us that need to be heard. So what else to do other than organise an event of our own - the first of the PRF UK gigs.""But what is this PRF thing?"", i hear you cry. It is the Premier Rock Forum, a self-appointed moniker that is so accurate it makes scientific validation redundant. Some of us are scientists.

<h3>Who is Tereya</h3>
<p><br/><span>    I was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri where I grew up with my two brothers and two sisters whom I love very much.</span></p>
<p><span>      I moved to Chicago after High School to pursue a dancing at Columbia College.  At Columbia College I met my friend Maurice who introduced me to the lord. I’ve been on fire for God since then.  </span><br/><span> I began going to Life changers International Church with Pastor Gregory Dickow, who teaches the uncompromised word of God. I  changed from the inside out once I heard his words of wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span>   The more my relationship with god grew, I begin writing songs about what he’s done for me. I express myself through rapping, dancing and singing. It’s so much fun praising a good God who believes in me, values me, loves me and wants me. The lord gave me a vision to change the world with the good news of Jesus Christ through gospel music to touch people everywhere. I have to tell people how much God loves them, wants them, and is pleased with them when they choose to live for God it’s the best decision to make in the world.  </span></p>

<p>All the funds raised will go directly into studio time, production expenses, and a mini tour. All other expenses will be covered out of pocket at the present time. Below is the estimated breakdown of those funds...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>First off, it's worthy of note , I'm working with two top-notch producer/engineers on this album, both of whom are giving me phenomenal, ""friendship"" rates.  Still, studio work is meticulous and takes a tremendous amount of time, so I am really happy to pay these dear friends what they are worth! Both are magnificent within their own rights:  <em>L. Sosa</em> of Vytil Records (executive producer) - who happens to have a proven track record that provides him great credibility. In addition our new found friend <em>John Terell</em> (and if you've heard any of his work, you understand why he is so uniquely suited for recording, mixing, and mastering. At this time its a rare and notable opportunity and I'm thankful! </p>
<p>Special Note: <strong><em>Would love to give you all nothing but the best for the b</em>est! <em>Below are a few things that I am in need of assitance with. I would like to secure all the following so that I can give you all a classic &amp; timeless album. </em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Studio time</strong></li>
<li><strong>Engineering</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Videography</strong><strong> </strong><em> </em>
</li>
<li><strong>East Coast Tour</strong></li>
<li><strong>CD Pressing</strong></li>
</ol><p> </p>
<p>The reality of the matter is, the overall costs may come closer to $12,000 than $7550 all told - I have kept my minimum low in order to keep this campaign manageable. Any funds raised past the $7550 mark will be great! That said, I will keep working with whatever I am blessed with: first priority is recording and mixing.  If we run out of funds before getting to the tour phase, I will seek out another private investor or label assistance at that point.  I am hopeful to finish the album by the early portion of 2013, so know that this is my aim and I will do everything I can to achieve it.  </p>
<p>Thank You All In Advance Love You! </p>

""I've been inspired by a ton of people to push forward with a singing career and now, FINALLY, I am in a position to record my first EP and film a video of my second single ""___________""! Will keep this a surprise. This brings me joy! The reason why I am reaching out is because I need your help. I will keep it short and simple. Your donation(s) will enable me cover the cost of studio time, musical production engineering, videography,, along with promotional tools i.e. flyers, a mini tour to spread myself beyond the local scene. I am trying to be as savvy as possible, therefore this EP will be available for digital download, however, I would like to have a possible 1500 cd's pressed up for A&R's, Radio Stations, Shows, Fans and DJ's. People have been asking me about an album for quite a while now, so I'm extremely excited to get to work on everything and get the final product to you.
 

If you have ANY questions about the progress, the album, or anything else message me on facebook and become apart of  team #init2win http://facebook.com/trevonsmusic
Keep track of the campaign and the album on myWebsite:http://trevonsmusic.com/

I am well aware that this is not going to be an easy process. My goal is to simply live my dream. I am passionate and I believe that we can make this happen. 
 
School that I want to attend to enhance my music career http://www.juilliard.edu/
 

 
With your help I will continue to build up my own college tuition... 
 
 

All the funds raised will go directly into studio time, production expenses, and a mini tour. All other expenses will be covered out of pocket at the present time. Below is the estimated breakdown of those funds...
 
First off, it's worthy of note , I'm working with two top-notch producer/engineers on this album, both of whom are giving me phenomenal, ""friendship"" rates.  Still, studio work is meticulous and takes a tremendous amount of time, so I am really happy to pay these dear friends what they are worth! Both are magnificent within their own rights:  L. Sosa of Vytil Records (executive producer) - who happens to have a proven track record that provides him great credibility. In addition our new found friend John Terell (and if you've heard any of his work, you understand why he is so uniquely suited for recording, mixing, and mastering. At this time its a rare and notable opportunity and I'm thankful! 
Special Note: Would love to give you all nothing but the best for the best! Below are a few things that I am in need of assitance with. I would like to secure all the following so that I can give you all a classic & timeless album. 

Studio time
Engineering

Videography  

East Coast Tour
CD Pressing
 
The reality of the matter is, the overall costs may come closer to $12,000 than $7550 all told - I have kept my minimum low in order to keep this campaign manageable. Any funds raised past the $7550 mark will be great! That said, I will keep working with whatever I am blessed with: first priority is recording and mixing.  If we run out of funds before getting to the tour phase, I will seek out another private investor or label assistance at that point.  I am hopeful to finish the album by the early portion of 2013, so know that this is my aim and I will do everything I can to achieve it.  
Thank You All In Advance Love You!

<p><strong><em>We are an indie band from Lima, Peru. We are 3 people composing and writing the songs: Fernanda Acosta, Johann Frech and Nicolas Eddowes.</em></strong></p>
<p>We are working on our debut album, untitled by now. Our songs are starting to being recorded, and it would take some time, everything is going great. Voice and instrument recording is covered, except drums recording. We have a producer, a mixing engineer, and a designer for cover arts. We need to pay them before any release, and also need to pay for 2 essencial things: mastering and publishing.</p>
<p>The idea of this project is to start recording our first 2 singles + our first music video: ""Good morning"" (Single) and ""Street Lights"" (Both single and video)</p>

<p>Spirit Descending is a Melodic Metal band from Central California, USA. They are trying to help put together enough funding to get the band going for their second studio album.  Influenced by many acts such as: Drain STH, L7, In This Moment and so on, Spirit Descending hopes to bring their act out of the Central Valley and go global with their new project.  After producing their album with a private studio in 2010, they are in the works of polishing up new music for a brand new outcome this year.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2><strong>The Facts</strong></h2>
<p>Our goal is $2000.</p>
<p>""There are five of us that make up this metal machine, but we live five very individual lives in five different cities doing our day-to-day thing.  Our passion lies within our music but because of ""real life"" getting in the way, we have postponed tours, shows, and recording."" - Krys (vocals)  ""We want to bring what we have to the table, and shine a light on this genre that has been overshadowed in this area.""</p>
<p>There are many benefits for helping towards this project, each adding on an extra bit of flair as you climb the donation ladder, including future perks that will be shipped out once the project is funded and completed this year. T-Shirts, Stickers, CD's, Oh My!</p>
<p>Even if our goal is <em>not</em> met, the earned funding will be available for the band to add to their savings, in hopes to continue on with our musical conquests.  Not making our goal can't and won't stop us from doing what we love to do!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>How you can make an Impact</h2>
<p>Times have changed but living the life of a ""Starving Artist"" has remained the same.  A lot of musicians are still struggling to showcase their art, but it is a well-known fact that with the power of networking and support from the community, it can happen.  Our locale is not quite in touch with the type of music we are creating, and with a new album, we are hoping to expand our reach.  With your help, our band can fulfill our dream.  </p>

<p><b>All Things Are Possible</b></p>
<p>This project is proof that with God, ALL things are possible.  Over three years ago, God gave me a dream to record a concert of original praise and worship songs and release it.  Sounds simple enough, doesn't it?</p>
<p>Well, if you don't already know, recording is NOT inexpensive.  Finding talented instrumentalists, singers, a venue, an engineer, lighting, cameras, microphones and all the other things needed is difficult, and can also be expensive.</p>
<p>I believe God orchestrated a series of events and relationships which allowed me to have wonderfully talented folks, including a Latin Grammy Award winning engineer, a wonderful group of skilled instrumentalists and singers, a venue, lights, cameras and recording gear to all be available at the right time.  The funds needed to secure the services of these superbly talented people were also provided in His timing for the recording to go on without a hitch!</p>
<p>Fast forward two and a half years.  The project is now 95 percent complete!  The mixing and mastering process is all that remains before we can replicate copies and have the project ready to release digitally.  Five songs have already been mixed!  My mix engineer, one of the worlds finest, is waiting to help me finish the project. </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The great thing is, the hardest work is behind us!  What lies ahead has already been planned.  The only remaining hurdle is a financial one, and with your help, we will make it over the top!</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>$6,750 is really the bare minimum it will take to complete the project.  Beyond that, there are marketing and promotion costs which will help spread the good news contained in the songs of this project.  Please help spread the word and accelerate the fruitfulness of this album through your giving, and by sharing the story with your friends.</p>
<p>There are some ""perks"" or as I like to call them, ""thank you gifts"" I would love to send you for your participation in making this dream come true!  Be sure to check them out!  You are not buying anything with your contribution, but I would love to give them to you as a reminder of my gratitude!</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Off The Wall studios, formerly located in Franklin, TN, has relocated to downtown Nashville, the heart of Music City.  Along with the move comes some renovations that are necessary to look good, and more importantly, sound good.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We pride ourselves in the high quality music we produce, and you are probably familiar with many of the projects we have worked on.  Collectively, we have worked with:  Kutless, Scott Stapp (Creed), Disciple, Pillar, Neal McCoy, Brian ""Head"" Welch, Building 429, FUZED, Stars Go Dim, Me In Motion, Seventh Day Slumber, Tamia, Megadeth, INXS, Bartek Krolik, Nine Lashes, and more.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Oops, looks like we dropped a few names, we'll pick them up.<br/></p>

<p></p>
<h3>About Us</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Off The Wall Recording Studio is: Lester Estelle Jr, Robert Venable, and Joshua Gleave.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Lester Estelle Jr:  drummer (Neal McCoy, Pillar, Stars Go Dim, more.), producer, and engineer.  </p>
<p>Robert Venable:  producer/engineer/mixer (Kutless, Disciple, INXS, Megadeth, more.)</p>
<p>Joshua Gleave:  guitarist, bassist, producer, engineer, and keyboardist (Pillar, Stars Go Dim, Aaron Shust, more).</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The money we raise through this fundraiser will help us continue to produce the stellar music we are known for.  Without it, we won't be able to build the studio the way it needs to be built, and you, the listener, will be forced to listen to old Nickelback albums.  Nobody wants that.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have saved thousands of dollars for the renovations we need to make to the studio, but we are a little short.  We need $7500 to get us to our goal, every dollar helps.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Here's where your money will go:  ripping down existing walls, building new walls, raising and building new ceilings, sound proofing, insulating, painting, new floors, and a new vocal booth and guitar room.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Here's what you get:  anything from your name on the wall at the studio, to having your songs produced by us, to meet&amp;greets with celebrities.  Additionally, you get to say you helped us.  You will help us continue to make the music you listen to on the treadmill, while driving to school or work, or the music you practice your accordion to.  (Don't act like you don't).  Oh, and free high-fives anytime you see us around.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Don't worry, even if we don't make our goal, we will still get the money that was donated, the renovations will just take longer to finish while we continue to save the necessary money. </p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>The arts are in trouble in this country. The economy is bad, and so orchestras, ballets, arts programs, and opera houses, all run mainly by patron donations, are closing down all over the country. An already small pool of jobs for opera singers are diminishing, and in order to stand out in one of the most competitive industries in the arts, one has to get creative. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>During the summer, most American singers attend summer music festivals or training programs either in the United States or Europe. Some programs are highly educational and provide great opportunities to their students. Some, are not. All of them are expensive. A few years ago, I attended a summer festival in Belgium. Many false promises were made, and for the most part, I felt that my money had been wasted. The one positive gain from that experience was my work with Stephanie Friede, an American soprano who now has her life and career in Europe. My experience got me thinking about how to create my own ""summer program"" in Europe. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Therefore this project was born. The main components of my program are</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Have voice lessons with Stephanie Friede to improve my singing technique</li>
<li>Spend time in French, German, and Italian speaking countries in order to improve my language skills by means of language immersion. I plan to spend time in the rural areas of these countries where they are less likely to speak English.</li>
<li>Attend as many operas and classical concerts as I can, in order to learn from the performances and observe the ways in which they differ from those here in the U.S.</li>
<li>Meet, talk to, and interview European singers, especially American singers who have made their careers in Europe, in order to learn the advantages of pursuing a career across the pond.</li>
<li>If possible, organize opera outreach programs in schools or rural areas.</li>
</ol>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The benefits of this program are huge, and I can accomplish more alone than I could in an organized summer festival with less money. I will save money by couchsurfing, traveling by train on a pre-paid train pass, buying ""standing room"" opera tickets, and strictly budgeting for food and additional travel costs. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<p></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>The primary purpose for this project, is to craft a unique educational opportunity, however I truly believe that my project will make me a better artist, colleague, teacher, and human being. I will be able to come back and share what I have discovered about the arts in Europe, and embark upon new projects with the intention of raising the same awareness and value for the arts here at home. </div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello,</p>

<p class=""p1""> <strong>The Story:</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">We (Dylan and Kristina) met almost two years ago and became fast friends. We began playing some shows together, then playing some songs together, then recording half Kristina's EP in Dyl's parents' house. When we started talking about a potential tour in the summer, it seemed like a lofty dream. But we thought we've gotten this far, why not take it to the next level and commit. So now we're doing it, and we're lucky enough to be joined by some of our closest friends on a tour through the midwest and around the west coast to explore new cities, spread our music, and revisit homes of our past. </p>
<p class=""p1""> <strong>The Goal:</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">Now we need your help. We crunched the numbers and tried for a goal we thought would be the most appropriate to ask, as well as enough to get us to where we need to be. Our tour will be incredibly expensive, especially with two cars so we can fit the millions of instruments Where Are All the Buffalo requires at every show. We're risking a lot going to cities we've never been before without any guarantee as to how much we'll walk away with per show and where we'll be sleeping that night. We know it will be long, exhausting, and sorta scary. But in the end, this is our dream. We've never wanted anything more than to tour the country and play music. We're asking for a little help from family, friends and caring strangers to help us fulfill this dream. </p>
<p class=""p1""> <strong>Perks and stuff!</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">The coolest part about donating is you get some cool perks yourself! We spent a night brainstorming really neat stuff, from unreleased songs to private shows to home-cooked meals! It means so much to us that you would take the time to help us out, so we want to give back to you. If we can make this goal and go on tour, we'd be accomplishing so much. We would be able to share our music with about 17 cities across the country as well as gain exposure. But most importantly, we would be living out an aspiration we've had since we were kids. Who doesn't want to be able to do that?</p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<p class=""p2"">Thanks so much for your time. We love you and you're awesome. We could never thank you enough.</p>

<p class=""full-description"">I need help with the basics - gas, a car rental, and a motel room with a little food thrown in. That's it. Nothing fancy. I'll drive out and stay with friends for two days, and stay at a motel for one. I'll sleep, get up, drink some hot apple juice (it always works) and go sing.

<p>The art we create is not only a reflection of God, but a response to the overwhelming beauty of Jesus and His grace towards us. We can't help but create as image bearers of Christ, who is the ultimate Creator. The church has a responsibility to create good art and pour into culture, not just imitate what is already there or throw together something just to have it. Our aim is not a sub-culture, but to pour art that speaks of Jesus into an existing one. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>We Need Your Help!</h3>
<p>The Paradox Church is still a young and growing church, so there are often more practical uses of the church's money than making a record, a film, or even hosting a concert or art &amp; film showing. This does not mean that the arts are not important or necessary for the church to do or take part in. They are an integral part of us loving and serving our city, but often set aside or forgotten. We want to make great art and don't have the budget, so we are getting creative! We have industry professionals who are donating their time and services to make this a great record. We want to honor their efforts as well as begin to invest in our future impact in culture, but we need your help!</p>

<p><em>Venues will be posted soon :) </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>So...here we are. </p>
<p>Not as a band, but as three men (well...basically.) looking to our fans, not for a plea or begging, but for honest help. We need to be able to go on tour. We also really need to prepare for recording our next album. Finally, we REALLY want to release our sophomore EP, ""Faith, Fear, and Hope"" early. And physically, at that. </p>
<p>Being in a band isn't as glamorous as MTV and YouTube makes it out to be. (Are bands even on MTV anymore?) </p>
<p>It costs a LOT of money to deliver the music we want to deliver to our fans. We have spent, and I literally tallied this, ~$21,000 out of our own pockets to fund the band from 2010 until this day, in the year 2013. That is a lot of money for broke musicians. We have pulled a lot of sacrifices to make this band reach incredibly far heights, places we never dreamed of reaching. We have played on the Vans Warped Tour. <em>Twice. </em>We are very close to being able to play for a third time! This is something we dreamed about as 14 year olds writing music and singing together. We never thought we'd have the chance. </p>
<p>We've booked our own tours. Filmed our own music videos (to great fan response, might I add. (Our last video got 21,000 views in, like, THREE days!!) We have played music with some of our idols, and gotten to share a song with one of the best vocalists out there today. AJ, we're looking at you my friend! </p>
<p>I could continue, but you understand by now. This is a dream that has been realized in a way that just wasn't fathomable to us. Ever. Even now, we thank everyone daily, via texting, Twitter, Facebook, or whatever else, for the incredible opportunity it is to play in this band for all of our fans. But now, we are coming to you with the need for help. We don't want to ask you to fund our tour and our next recording project for nothing, so we are including awesome perks for every backer. From $1 to $3000, you'll be getting something we have put a lot of thought into. </p>
<p><br/>We are feverishly and viciously taking the next step to making Dear You the next big thing. We love the amount of fans we have now, but we want to be on your TV, your iPods, your computer screens, and on that weird billboard the city installed thats really big and fancy. Basically, we need to grow bigger. </p>
<p>We really need your help here. If you can find the time to throw anything down for this band, you will be greatly rewarded. Drop your cell number in when you pay for your perk, we will send you a text message and personally thank you. This is really THAT important. Thank you so much for reading this, you are all beautiful. Just by taking a look, you've already helped.</p>

So...here we are. 
Not as a band, but as three men (well...basically.) looking to our fans, not for a plea or begging, but for honest help. We need to be able to go on tour. We also really need to prepare for recording our next album. Finally, we REALLY want to release our sophomore EP, ""Faith, Fear, and Hope"" early. And physically, at that. 
Being in a band isn't as glamorous as MTV and YouTube makes it out to be. (Are bands even on MTV anymore?) 
It costs a LOT of money to deliver the music we want to deliver to our fans. We have spent, and I literally tallied this, ~$21,000 out of our own pockets to fund the band from 2010 until this day, in the year 2013. That is a lot of money for broke musicians. We have pulled a lot of sacrifices to make this band reach incredibly far heights, places we never dreamed of reaching. We have played on the Vans Warped Tour. Twice. We are very close to being able to play for a third time! This is something we dreamed about as 14 year olds writing music and singing together. We never thought we'd have the chance. 
We've booked our own tours. Filmed our own music videos (to great fan response, might I add. (Our last video got 21,000 views in, like, THREE days!!) We have played music with some of our idols, and gotten to share a song with one of the best vocalists out there today. AJ, we're looking at you my friend! 
I could continue, but you understand by now. This is a dream that has been realized in a way that just wasn't fathomable to us. Ever. Even now, we thank everyone daily, via texting, Twitter, Facebook, or whatever else, for the incredible opportunity it is to play in this band for all of our fans. But now, we are coming to you with the need for help. We don't want to ask you to fund our tour and our next recording project for nothing, so we are including awesome perks for every backer. From $1 to $3000, you'll be getting something we have put a lot of thought into. 
We are feverishly and viciously taking the next step to making Dear You the next big thing. We love the amount of fans we have now, but we want to be on your TV, your iPods, your computer screens, and on that weird billboard the city installed thats really big and fancy. Basically, we need to grow bigger. 
We really need your help here. If you can find the time to throw anything down for this band, you will be greatly rewarded. Drop your cell number in when you pay for your perk, we will send you a text message and personally thank you. This is really THAT important. Thank you so much for reading this, you are all beautiful. Just by taking a look, you've already helped.
Love always,
Chris, Mason, and Louis",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<br/><h3>What Are We Doing!?</h3>
<p>We (Jake, Steven, Matthew, Andrew) have been playing music together for 9 years. This is our first official release as a band, and we want it to sound AMAZING.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What Do We Need!? &amp; What Do You Get!?</h3>
<p>We need $5200 for mixing, mastering and printing physical CD's. Here is the cost breakdown:</p>
<p>Mixing - $500/song x5 = $2500<span><br/></span><span>Mastering - $125/song x5 = $625<span><br/></span><span>Printing CD's - $4/CD x300 = $1200<span><br/></span>Leeway/Indiegogo fee's - $875</span></span></p>
<p>We also have some AWESOME perks that you should GO CHECK OUT NOW. They range from an early EP download, to a 60 second personalized song in the genre of your choice, to a full blown show in your living room! We will do everything we can to ship, send links, perform, etc. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.</p>

<p>Rikavista is not just a band. We want our music to make MANY differences in this world. We have partnered with multiple non-profit organizations, including Wounded Warrior Project, Blue Santa, and Stand For Freedom. Right now we are starting a social movement called Bands Serving Bands. It's dedicated to encouraging artists to support other artists in their creative community, instead of treating each other as competition, or a threat. We all love our art, and should have the same respect for others that want to pursue this adventure.</p>

The rest will be a digital download on the website for fans and industry. CD duplication is $200Initial Cost of building our website $700If we don't reach our entire goal, the money we receive will go first to the mastering and then website development. It will only be a digital release if we don't get the funds for the CD's to be duplicated. As far as our website, we will build it as soon as we can but that won't stop us from having the songs available to fans and hitting the pavement in January for prospective clients.Other Ways You Can Help

Hip hop is dull nowadays. Whatever happened to the origin of hip hop? The days when you actually anticipated watching your favorite rapper's video?  
When it was all about fun? Expressing yourself and enjoying friends? 
Well I am here to bring all that back into a clearer focus. I know many 
of you have seen the movie Project X and for those who haven't go do it 
now. It's about the party of a lifetime. I decided that that would be 
the best theme for my next video:the party of a life time. From the extras to the audience in front of their computer screen i want everyone to have a sense of euphoria after the video is over. The title of 
the song is ""No Time For Relaxin"""" and it's definitely no time for that 
while swimming in a kiddy pool full of jello or doing shots of a Ron 
Jeremy look alike. </p>
<p>
The breakdown of the $1100 is $600 will be paid to the 
videographer/producer for his services. $200 will be spent to rent out 
the warehouse, which will be the venue for the shoot. $150 will be spent
 to hire a dj for the event/shoot.The remaining $150 will be used to 
purchase props, such as a kiddie pool, lots of jello, glow sticks for 
the partygoers, body paint, etc. Currently, I am working on a new 
project and have completely devoted my time and energy to my talent as a
 hip hop artist so every donation is greatly appreciated to make my 
dream become a visual explosion for myself and my fan. For those of you who can not make a donation, keep the positive energy going and spread the word. Let's bring art back to music. I'll love you forever plus infinity.  </p>

<h3>ABOUT SOULFUL OBSESSION'S IndieGOGO CAMPAIGN</h3>
<p>This fundraising campaign is vital to the completion of our 5-song EP product, which we will be releasing in late January or early February to the public, online, and on iTunes. Your contributions will help us significantly in finishing the recording and mixing process of the music and bringing to the life an extravagant release event that signifies the official launch of our exclusive music to the masses. From there, we will embark on a tour to promote the EP and aim to gain more exposure and increase our fanbase beyond the Bay Area of California. Your contributions will greatly help us achieve and execute this plan of our sharing our creativity that we have worked at and perfected for months on end.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>OUR IndieGoGo TARGET GOAL</h3>
<p><br/>Soulful Obsession's target financial goal is $5,000. The funds raised will help us finance our studio hours, where we will put the final touches on instrumental and vocal recording, mixing, and mastering.

<p>New Orleans, La is a gothy tourist destination within it's own right. With it's long history and haunted reputation it is one of the most truly ""goth"" cities in the United States. New Orleans offers many lovely attractions to visit, many stores catering to the odd and macabre, and many haunted tours are available. Plus there is that added attraction of selling Alcohol 24-7!</p>
<p><strong>Accommodations:</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>We are working to secure a hotel for you located in the French Quarter. Stay tuned for updates.</p>
<strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong>
<p> As everyone knows starting a new event/festival is tough. It is even tougher to start a event catering to a specific subculture, especially the Gothic/Deathrock scenes here in the USA. We are looking to give something awesome to the scenes we love and we need your help! We want this to be more than a small festival but a memorable event that we can continue to host each year. In order to hold this event at a quality venue and to insure our talent is paid we need funding. Each and every one of us is digging into our own pockets for this event, but that's just not enough! We need you YOU the gothic scene to help give us your support so we can give you something worth everyone's time and efforts!</p>
<p>Our venue alone will cost of the $3500 goal we have, we are prepared to pay the talent out of our own pockets. However if we go over our goal we will use all funds to pay talent, book more talent, and put back into the festival to make it even better and more decadent. We do not plan to do this half-way. When we do a Gothic Ball we do it right. Cobwebs, Candles, Dripping lace? We've got it and more!</p>
<p>What will you get for helping us? We are prepared to offer our eternal thanks along with some really nifty rewards for backing our project. This includes thank yous on our event page, t-shirts, free tickets to the event, VIP packages etc.</p>
</div>
<div>The gothic scene in the USA is budding again and it is time to start having some extravagant and fun events again. We want to bring back events in the spirit of the popular gothic festivals of years past. We can do this with your help!! Even one dollar will help!</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Intresting Facts:</strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div><span class=""notranslate"">Did you know that our tentative venue Tipitina’s is a non profit? All proceeds they make at events after covering venue rental goes to there Tipitina’s foundation which supports local musicians and the music history of New Orleans. We thought by doing our event here we would help give back to the music community in a city we love!</span></div>
<p><strong>Well who are these spooky folk exactly?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>We know you don't wanna fork over your hard earned cash to just any noobs that say the are putting on a event. But we have a talented group of well seasoned spooky people behind our event and we want to tell you a bit about us.</p>

<p><strong>Kris Prudhomme aka Dj Hex:</strong> Kris is a Dj and event promoter who now hails from Lake Charles but works often in new orleans and formly Houston Tx. His group Unholy Burial Productions will be working in context with Shadow Society productions to bring you this event.

Goths Ghosts and Ghouls are welcome! Ticket price point we are aiming for is $29.99 there will be a full bar at the venue.
At the moment there is no halloween event dedicated soley to the gothic scene going on in New Orleans on Halloween weekend, we have our friends at the vampire and witches balls but no event ESPECIALLY for Gothic/Deathrock music. We are aiming to change that!
 
Our Talent:
Headlining our line-up is Gothic/Deathrock legends Ex Voto. Ex Voto come straight out of the 80s Californa deathrock scene, have lived in New Orleans, and now call Texas their home.

 
2nd Headliner:
Fangs on Fur (Los Angeles, CA)

 
Supporting acts are:
Gothic rock band Ending the Vicious Cycle (Fort worth Texas)

 
POST RAPTURE PARTY (SEATTLE, WA)

 
and Post Punk band The Secret Post (Oklahoma).

 
Our Guest Dj is Dj Jose, of Arkham Brooklyn NYC.
Also Dj Hex (Lake Charles/Nola)
 
Spooky Burlesque by:
Siouxsie Monroe
and Dark Songstress Lemme Addams
Plus vendors will be selling spooky wares for you to peruse and purchase!
 
The City:

New Orleans, La is a gothy tourist destination within it's own right. With it's long history and haunted reputation it is one of the most truly ""goth"" cities in the United States. New Orleans offers many lovely attractions to visit, many stores catering to the odd and macabre, and many haunted tours are available. Plus there is that added attraction of selling Alcohol 24-7!
Accommodations:
We are working to secure a hotel for you located in the French Quarter. Stay tuned for updates.
What We Need & What You Get
 As everyone knows starting a new event/festival is tough. It is even tougher to start a event catering to a specific subculture, especially the Gothic/Deathrock scenes here in the USA. We are looking to give something awesome to the scenes we love and we need your help! We want this to be more than a small festival but a memorable event that we can continue to host each year. In order to hold this event at a quality venue and to insure our talent is paid we need funding. Each and every one of us is digging into our own pockets for this event, but that's just not enough! We need you YOU the gothic scene to help give us your support so we can give you something worth everyone's time and efforts!
Our venue alone will cost of the $3500 goal we have, we are prepared to pay the talent out of our own pockets. However if we go over our goal we will use all funds to pay talent, book more talent, and put back into the festival to make it even better and more decadent. We do not plan to do this half-way. When we do a Gothic Ball we do it right. Cobwebs, Candles, Dripping lace? We've got it and more!
What will you get for helping us? We are prepared to offer our eternal thanks along with some really nifty rewards for backing our project. This includes thank yous on our event page, t-shirts, free tickets to the event, VIP packages etc.

The gothic scene in the USA is budding again and it is time to start having some extravagant and fun events again. We want to bring back events in the spirit of the popular gothic festivals of years past. We can do this with your help!! Even one dollar will help!
 
Intresting Facts:
 
Did you know that our tentative venue Tipitina’s is a non profit? All proceeds they make at events after covering venue rental goes to there Tipitina’s foundation which supports local musicians and the music history of New Orleans. We thought by doing our event here we would help give back to the music community in a city we love!
Well who are these spooky folk exactly?
We know you don't wanna fork over your hard earned cash to just any noobs that say the are putting on a event. But we have a talented group of well seasoned spooky people behind our event and we want to tell you a bit about us.
Tracy Robertson AKA ""Batty"": Batty has been a part of the gothic scene since about 1996. She is the force behind the popular brand Azrael's Accomplice Designs, a former alt.model, and A scene Promoter and Dj in Dallas, Texas. Batty's group the Shadow Society produce events locally in DFW with much success and are ready to expand to New Orleans to help bring you this event. She has also attended, vended, and done just about everything in between at many gothic festivals across north america for more years then she would care to mention.
Kris Prudhomme aka Dj Hex: Kris is a Dj and event promoter who now hails from Lake Charles but works often in new orleans and formly Houston Tx. His group Unholy Burial Productions will be working in context with Shadow Society productions to bring you this event. Kris is also a founder of the Age of Decay festival which was also successfully funded last year!

<p>My name is Genevieve Heyward and I'm a singer-songwriter residing in Door County, Wisconsin.

<h2>Savage Beginnings </h2>
<p>In 2015, a group of us lovers of high octane rock n roll paid attention to the fact that our region had great bands and a dying economy, so the obvious thing to do was put our money where the music was and go old school.  We found a local club willing to host it, and thus was born the Savage Mountain Punk Festival. <strong>Our goal: keep ticket prices low so as not to price out the local music fans while simultaneously bringing in acts that would attract some tourism.</strong></p>
<p>Fast forward five years and Savage Mountain Punk Fest has gotten local business sponsors to help house, feed, and support the bands; joined forces with the county tourism board to advertise the festival; hosted national and international acts (The Queers, The Undead, Argyle Goolsby); added a third day to the Festival; and attracted punks from over 20 states coast to coast.  </p>
<p>Our goal remains to keep ticket prices low while bringing in name acts in an intimate venue. It provides all the support of a club show with all the closeness of a house show.  That's the Savage Mountain Punk Fest experience.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>DIY</h2>
<p>Our funds go to artists. That's it. Let's keep ticket prices affordable, put a show on in an intimate venue, and bring in name acts. We've increased the band budget by 500% since the first Festival, and support from music lovers helps make it happen. Our goal of $2000 goes to paying the bands, including a major internationally known punk act (to be announced April 3) who's already agreed to join us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Support live music and help a small Appalachian town with tourism and economic development.</li>
<li>Get music, tickets, limited edition t-shirts, locally-roasted Savage Mountain Punk Roast coffee, and special other perks.</li>
<li>Develop an audience for smaller regional bands who get the exposure of playing in a Festival: bands have networked for shows, met with label executives, and grown their prestige by playing the festival. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your support helps touring musicians, many of whom make a living by playing rock n roll, and helps a small town. The Festival happens in the heart of Frostburg, Maryland's A&amp;E district; it helps support coffeeshops, restaurants, indie book stores and record stores, and other small business as well as area hotels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 50 local and regional businesses of all sorts (from coffeeshops and tattoo parlors to doctor's offices; from regional radio stations to the City of Frostburg and Allegany County Tourism) support what we do because they see the results.</li>
<li>After five years, the Festival continues to grow its audience and reputation, and we've been fortunate to have support from funders from all over the country.</li>
<li>We hear from bands from all over the world that want to be a part of the Savage Mountain Festival, we hear from bands from all over the region who want to play. That's why this year we're starting a day earlier than previously. Continued growth. That's success.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>The Festival gets bigger that means more logistics, more audience members, and more things that might go wrong for a small group of volunteers who all work full-time jobs. It also means getting more hands on deck. Fortunately, when bands have canceled in the past, we've been able to replace them as more bands want to play the Festival than we have slots available. Other past problems included a band caterer cancelling last minute (a friend of the Festival made food for the bands instead) and a hotel closing (the audience was moved to another close by).  The good thing is the Festival has a lot of support from the Frostburg community at large, whether they like the music or not. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>   We have begun work on our 3rd studio album and we could use your help completing it! We have been playing together for 8 years, over 800 shows in 35 states and have loved every minute of it (well maybe not <i>every</i> minute). There have been many sacrifices made in our personal lives to keep the band together and the show on the road. With the current state of the music industry and the large expenses that come with making a record we find ourselves in need of little help from our friends.<i>  </i></p>
<p>   Ken Coomer (formerly of Wilco and Uncle Tupelo) is going producing our new batch of songs in his studio in Nashville and we are very excited about working with him. Recording is expensive and we have put thousands of dollars of our own money into this project already. Your contribution will help with the recording, production and promotional costs that come with making a record. We have schemed up some great perks to accompany your contribution with some unique opportunities available.</p>
<p>   Chamomile and Whiskey has always been a family, we've had so much help to get us where we are now and we are very grateful for it. This feels like an important time for us, we have a lot riding on this record and want to do it right. Your consideration and support mean so much to us... we give you our most sincere ""Thank You.""</p>
<p>Chamomile and Whiskey</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>   What we need is pretty simple... to make and unveil this record in the best way possible. We have an amazing opportunity to work with acclaimed producer Ken Coomer in his analog studio in Nashville. The work as already begun and your contributions will go towards completing the album (tracking, mixing, mastering and production) as well as the promotional campaign for the record release. </p>
<p>   We had a lot of fun coming up with the list of perks. The easiest thing we can ask of you is to consider ""pre-ordering"" the album. But if you'd like to go for something more unique we've got some great options... flowers from Marie, jewelry from Marsh, postcards from the road, custom song from Koda, VIP parties and our favorite, have the band play a party at your house! </p>
<p>  $12,000 is the lowest number we could come up with to make the full record and promote it the way we feel is necessary, We've already put in thousands of dollars of our own money but the bank account is running low. Any contribution or help sharing the campaign is most appreciated. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>   We are so excited about this batch of songs! We feel very lucky to have the following that we do, especially in Virginia, but for the band to continue on we really need to be able to grow our fanbase nationally. Releasing <i>Wandering Boots </i>and <i>Sweet Afton</i>, we learned so much about making and putting out records... we feel that we finally have the right plan to make this album and help bring the band to a wider audience. </p>
<p>   The opportunity we have right now to work in Nashville with a great producer is something we do not want to waste. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>    The current state of the music industry makes it very tough for bands to make a big impact. People are not buying nearly as many records and streaming services do not make most bands a significant amount of money. We have seen many other acts have a lot of success doing it on their own. 8 years ago we probably wouldn't have been able to put this money to the best use... but our years of experience leave us with a lot of confidence to execute our plan. Most importantly, we feel like we can make the album that we want to make... the best possible recording and representation of what we are right now. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>    Sadly, none of us have a trust fund to dip into and we understand that many people simply cannot afford a financial contribution. Sharing our campaign is a huge help to us, if you've enjoyed a show or like a song please use social media to let people know that we aren't too bad and we could use a little help. </p>
<p>Thank You all.  </p>

   Chamomile and Whiskey has always been a family, we've had so much help to get us where we are now and we are very grateful for it. This feels like an important time for us, we have a lot riding on this record and want to do it right. Your consideration and support mean so much to us... we give you our most sincere ""Thank You.""
Chamomile and Whiskey

What We Need & What You Get
   What we need is pretty simple... to make and unveil this record in the best way possible. We have an amazing opportunity to work with acclaimed producer Ken Coomer in his analog studio in Nashville. The work as already begun and your contributions will go towards completing the album (tracking, mixing, mastering and production) as well as the promotional campaign for the record release. 
   We had a lot of fun coming up with the list of perks. The easiest thing we can ask of you is to consider ""pre-ordering"" the album. But if you'd like to go for something more unique we've got some great options... flowers from Marie, jewelry from Marsh, postcards from the road, custom song from Koda, VIP parties and our favorite, have the band play a party at your house! 
  $12,000 is the lowest number we could come up with to make the full record and promote it the way we feel is necessary, We've already put in thousands of dollars of our own money but the bank account is running low. Any contribution or help sharing the campaign is most appreciated. 

The Impact
   We are so excited about this batch of songs! We feel very lucky to have the following that we do, especially in Virginia, but for the band to continue on we really need to be able to grow our fanbase nationally. Releasing Wandering Boots and Sweet Afton, we learned so much about making and putting out records... we feel that we finally have the right plan to make this album and help bring the band to a wider audience. 
   The opportunity we have right now to work in Nashville with a great producer is something we do not want to waste. 

Risks & Challenges
    The current state of the music industry makes it very tough for bands to make a big impact. People are not buying nearly as many records and streaming services do not make most bands a significant amount of money. We have seen many other acts have a lot of success doing it on their own. 8 years ago we probably wouldn't have been able to put this money to the best use... but our years of experience leave us with a lot of confidence to execute our plan. Most importantly, we feel like we can make the album that we want to make... the best possible recording and representation of what we are right now. 

Other Ways You Can Help
    Sadly, none of us have a trust fund to dip into and we understand that many people simply cannot afford a financial contribution. Sharing our campaign is a huge help to us, if you've enjoyed a show or like a song please use social media to let people know that we aren't too bad and we could use a little help. 
Thank You all.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, this is Sam Erickson, frontman of We Are Not a Glum Lot. We've been a band for 8 years now, and have accomplished and experienced things I would have never in my wildest dreams imagined. This newest record is my favorite yet, and the three of us would love to get it in the hands of as many people as possible. This can only be achieved if it has a strong physical presence. We believe we can distribute it most effectively through having it pressed onto cassette tapes, and compact discs. This way, there are multiple mediums you could listen to the new record way. While I make music solely for myself, hearing people's reactions to my songs is incredibly touching, and inspiring. It is a great feeling when people can bond over the general experience of being human. By donating to this campaign, you are supporting artists pursuing what they love. You are contributing to the distribution of sincere music, which will hopefully be enjoyed and related to by many.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All of our funds went into the actual production of the record. Raising the aforementioned funds took time, and now that the record is done, we simply do not have the resources we need to get it mastered and physically produced. To press the Cassette Tapes, we will be going through duplication.ca which specializes in tape duplication. We plan for the production of 150 cassettes to cost roughly $250. For the cd's, we will use discmakers.com, a very reliable, professional company. We plan for 150 CD's to also roughly be $250. The remaining 250$ will be going to Marc Benning, producer at HideAway Studios, to master the 7 track album. Mastering, in laymen's terms, balances the sonic qualities of music to optimize the quality of playback across all mediums of music listening. In exchange for your financial support, you will be able to preorder the record on tape and CD. You will be able to buy We Are Not a Glum Lot t-shirts (new and old) and even pay for a performance by us at a time and place of your choosing, within reason, of course. If you are interested in attending our Record Release celebration, we even have album/ticket bundles in exchange for your support. In the event that we don't meet or goal, we will still use the funds we have for the aforementioned needs of pressing and mastering the record.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have poured our hearts and souls into this record, and we really think it shows. In a world full of technology and synthetic sounds and images, we wanted to make something that was very human and genuine. It is obvious that this record is important to us, and as a result we are confident that others will enjoy it as well, and we aim to get it in the hands of as many people as we possibly can. Back in 2010, we did a crowdfunding campaign to raise double of what we're asking now, $1500, to record our first EP. The campaign was very successful and helped us become more in touch with the community that supports us. Again, it is time for us to reach out to our incredibly kind, caring, community and ask for their help, which is always greatly, greatly appreciated.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>A difficult part of this campaign will simply be drumming up enough attention to it. We will need the help others to spread it around. Through trial and error, I have become a bit accustomed to promoting, both digitally and physically. We will tirelessly work to garner attention to this page. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>This is a very exciting project for Beth, it will be her second full length release. The intention is to have this album launch Beth onto the national stage in Canada. The album will be recorded in Toronto at The Hive with award winning producer, Timothy Abraham. Through extensive pre-production and tracking of over 40 demos the album has been narrowed down to 10 songs that show off the best of Beth’s music. A lot of great Canadian musicians have already signed on to be a part of the recordings such as Adam Warner (Jill Barber, Drummer) , Mark McIntyre (Emma-Lee, Bass), Bryden Baird (Feist, Horns). Recently, the CBC Radio 1 show Bandwidth did a live interview with Beth that will feature her song ‘Love Now’ (one of the demos for this album). On Canada Day Beth performed on Major’s Hill in Ottawa, as well as participated in the CBC Canada Day songwriter’s circle. These performances were aired coast to coast and will help give her the momentum needed to launch this album on a National platform. Three Songs off of Beth’s previous album found success with film and television placement, including features in internationally distributed documentary ‘ A Second Knock at the Door’. Her song ‘Love Now’ which will be on this album have already been featured on the hit show Degrassi. Requests have already been made from music supervisors at MTV and CHOP SHOP (Grey’s Anatomy, Mad Men, Private Practice, etc.) We are confident that this album will be successful in several areas: film and tv placement, online and physical sales, social media fan base expansion, etc. Beth is already beginning to step onto the national stage and and believes that this album is going to help her step through already open doors.</span></p>

<div>
<h3>What Beth Needs &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><span>This is a very ambitious project for Beth.  The total cost of the album is around $24,000, not including marketing and production.  All money raised for the album will go to the cost of recording and production and all extra funds will go towards touring and marketing the album.  Beth has put together a very unique perk package so that everyone gets something in return for their generous support.  </span></p>
<p><strong>There are many options for you to help Beth out. </strong></p>
<p><span>You can purchase a<strong> ‘fan-package’</strong> which is for fans who just want some product and some other great gifts!</span></p>
<p><span>There are <strong>‘corporate sponsorship packages</strong>’ for small business owners who need graphic design work and other things alike.  Beth is a freelance designer and has gotten some very talented friends to jump on board to reach all of your design and marketing needs.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are not a business but a musician or entrepreneur, Beth has put together a more modest <strong>‘design-package’</strong> for you! </span></p>

<strong>“Quietly she woke, dream songs of love and loss echoing and fading till she sleepily sang a reply.</strong>

ABOUT ME

Hi, My name is Ilona Harker and…
I am a singer/songwriter and storyteller.
I swim through dark spaces and walk blindly in deeper places.
I flounder in pools of words desperate to find the perfect dance.
I also like to sleep and play dress ups but mostly.....
I am a songwriter and as such, have a tendency to fall into the depths.
I like to think my music takes people into those ancient wilds and depths, humming through worn bones and softly singing life back.

<h3>Hi everyone! </h3>
<p>My name is Josh.  I've been dj'ing professionally in the San Francisco bay area for about 18 years now.  I play for all types of events ranging from weddings to clubs.  Yesterday morning I received a voicemail from my dad saying that my van was gone.  My van contains all of my dj equipment so I can play at these parties for my clients and their guests.  </p>
<p>Before this occured I was already in $10,000 debt, now we can call it $40,000.  I figure every little bit counts and one of my friends from facebook suggested that I try out a campiagn and he would even contribute.  So, here I am.  I usually am not the type of person to ask for help, I like to do things on my own... But, at this moment in time I really need help.  Basically, I'm starting from the ground up again (equipment wise), and I could use all the help I could get.</p>
<p>To get me going again, I would need to allocate $3000 for my sound system including my brand new pioneer DDJSX mixing system that was $1,100 that I used once before my van was taken.  Lighting with a truss system needs replacing which is going to cost me in upwards of $1,500 including a haze machine that was also in the vehicle.  </p>
<p>Here are some perks that my friend came up with <span>$25 - big hug from Josh, $100 - 1 hour session with Josh, $750 - 3 hour private party set.</span></p>

My name is Josh.  I've been dj'ing professionally in the San Francisco bay area for about 18 years now.  I play for all types of events ranging from weddings to clubs.  Yesterday morning I received a voicemail from my dad saying that my van was gone.  My van contains all of my dj equipment so I can play at these parties for my clients and their guests.  
Before this occured I was already in $10,000 debt, now we can call it $40,000.  I figure every little bit counts and one of my friends from facebook suggested that I try out a campiagn and he would even contribute.  So, here I am.  I usually am not the type of person to ask for help, I like to do things on my own... But, at this moment in time I really need help.  Basically, I'm starting from the ground up again (equipment wise), and I could use all the help I could get.
To get me going again, I would need to allocate $3000 for my sound system including my brand new pioneer DDJSX mixing system that was $1,100 that I used once before my van was taken.  Lighting with a truss system needs replacing which is going to cost me in upwards of $1,500 including a haze machine that was also in the vehicle.  
Here are some perks that my friend came up with $25 - big hug from Josh, $100 - 1 hour session with Josh, $750 - 3 hour private party set.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, there and thank you for taking the time to check out our campaign! We are “A New Challenger Approaches”, a local band based in San Diego, California. We have been working hard and making a name for ourselves since 2008. As a band we have given up everything including leaving our hometown of Yuma, Arizona to pursue this dream and we will continue to work towards achieving it. With that being said, we also want to help encourage others to follow their dreams no matter what the stakes may be. We believe we can successfully do both by making and properly executing this music video.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Any amount donated will make a difference. Your contribution will cover costs such as locations, props, make-up, equipment, and promotions.</li>
<li>We tried to think of perks that are special and that show we appreciate the help. We will personally email you a special thank you along with a digital download. If that isn’t grand enough we would like to recognize your help on one of our Behind the scene videos. Also we included our T-shirts. Come on who doesn’t love merch? Last, but certainly not least, you can say you played a big role in this exciting project as an executive producer!</li>
</ul><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>For this music video we are teaming up with various up and coming artists from Los Angeles. So not only will this video help promote us, but also it’s the perfect chance for them to show case their skills and talents. Any amount donated is truly appreciated and going toward the production of this collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Concept</strong></p>
<p>Our story revolves around a young girl whom has grown in a world where there is only one socially accepted type of person; a perfect person. She was set up to believe that she is flawed and she is doing anything and everything to be that ideal person. Her journey is a tough one, but she finds her true antagonist is herself and the way she views herself.</p>
<p>Our video is deeply meaningful and set to inspire others to have hope. We all have that light that guides us and no matter how dim it may seem we want to remind people that this light never goes out.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Not only are we grateful that you are interested in our project, but we would appreciate it even more if you helped spread the word. So go out tell your friends, your classmates, your co-workers, and even your mom! Just help spread the word with the link:</p></div>","Short Summary

<p><span>My name is Kara Evelyn - AKA  KaraBeara - a</span>nd I am asking for support in my quest to make GREAT music for kids! My aim is to put together a high-quality Music Demo meant to inspire and teach imagination, creativity, a love of play, and to support the healthy development of children’s socialization skills. The money raised through this campaign will accomplish the following: </p>
<ol>
<li><span>It will go towards Recording, Mixing, Mastering and the Arrangement of the songs I’ve written with a professional producer. </span></li>
<li><span> This upon completion will help me to submit myself for full-length album funding from government and other music funding organizations like Factor, Ontario Arts Council and Toronto Arts Council. </span></li>
<li><span>It will start me in building a repertoire with which I can then submit for performances in community concerts, grade schools, festivals, competitions and media reviews. </span></li>
<li><span>It will show my skills off to possible other collaborators looking for talent to work on their music and bring in talent for my projects. </span></li>
<li><span>It will allow me to submit my music for licensing opportunities like Children’s TV Shows, Satellite Radio Stations and Galaxie Radio Stations geared toward kids. </span></li>
</ol><p><span>This funding is also meant to contribute towards website creation, marketing, promotion, distribution, and overall will start me off on the independent career path of musical artistry I’ve longed to be apart of all my life. </span></p>
<p>I have been singing since I was 12 years old. In the past I have been a backup singer for a groovy funk band, headlined for a full, big-band jazz orchestra, been a diva for a burlesque troupe, brought tears to some eyes, smiles to some faces, and audiences to their feet -- But there is NOTHING like the feeling I get from inspiring a child to dance and sing along to something I have created. It is a truly magical feeling, so I hope you will help me to perpetuate the magic.</p>

<p>My Captain My Sea is a Post-Rock band from Pittsburgh, Pa.</p>
<p>We first started out as a three-piece band in the summer of 2010. Back then, we were mostly just a high school band. But once we hit college, however, we started to get serious. We changed drummers and added a bassist to the band. We’ve gone on two tours since then and we’ve played with some noticeable bands, like And So I Watch You From Afar, The End Of The Ocean, Empire Empire (I Was a Lonely Estate), Modern Baseball, Trophy Scars, and many others.</p>

<p>Both Songs from that teaser are the demo version of the tracks that will be released on our latest album  Grow Up or Die Alone</p>
<h3>Why Crowd Sourcing?</h3>
<p>I believe that our music, and this album, should be produced on vinyl.  Due to the amount of hard work and effort we put into creating this, we want to show our work in the best form of art and sound quality possible. Plus, Brianne Camesi has done an amazing job on this album cover. We’d honestly love to fund this whole thing ourselves, but due to the cost of creating vinyl, we need your help. We are not asking for help paying for CDs, recording, touring, and anything else. We just want to create a pre-order type of investment so that we can make the vinyl possible.</p>
<h2><strong>Where is your money going?</strong></h2>
<p>100% of it is going to the production of putting this album on vinyl.</p>
<h3>What will you get in return?</h3>
<p>The Digital Download, as soon as we get it back. It’ll be months in advance from our release date.<br/> Physical CD</p>

<h3>Why am I doing this?</h3>
<p>April 14, 2014 is a day that I will never forget. It is the day that with God I overcame a life of drug and alcohol addiction. April 14, 2014 is the day that I was reborn.</p>
<p>REBORN is important to me because I believe that through music, I can make a difference.  If I can help just one person overcome their addiction it is all worth it.  REBORN is so much more than just an album, it is an opportunity to give a message of hope.  It is an opportunity to share my story of recovery and hopefully inspire someone else to seek out a clean life. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we need &amp; what you get</h3>
<p>My goal is $6,000.  Making a quality record is not an easy or cheap task.  The $6000 covers the cost of studio time, mixing, mastering and CD printing.  When we reach that goal lets not stop there, because at $8,000 I will be able get my story out to more people through events, performances and more promotional materials.  The whole reason I'm doing this is to help as many people as I can.  At $10,000 I can start working towards making more music. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Addiction is a problem that is destroying lives all over the world.  It is an epidemic that is taking too many lives way too soon.  I believe that if I can help just one person overcome addiction I have fulfilled my purpose.  With your support I know that we can touch lives and we can save lives. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>The challenge I face in my mission through this campaign is helping people fight the disease of addiction! This is especially difficult considering the large heroin epidemic in Ohio, but I overcame it! Knowing that gives me hope for others, and I believe that it gives others hope of their own.</li></ul>

Michael Lanci, Nina Shekhar, and Nathan Campbell are currently writing three pieces celebrating the unique sounds of the flute, harp and wide range of percussive instruments. Your sponsorship of this project would be used to help fund:</p>
<p style=""font-weight: inherit;margin-bottom:20px;padding:0px;border-width:0px;font-style: inherit;font-variant: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-family: inherit;vertical-align: baseline;"">1) Professional Recording and editing of the three new works with ""Bass Note Productions"" during the week of May 9, 2016. These recordings will be given to the composers for their professional use (which rarely is ever done for newly composed music).</p>
<p style=""font-weight: inherit;margin-bottom:20px;padding:0px;border-width:0px;font-style: inherit;font-variant: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-family: inherit;vertical-align: baseline;"">2) All business materials associated with the premiere performance including advertising, compensation to the composers for their hard work, compensation to the performers for rehearsing, practicing, and premiering the works, and any fees associated with the venue where the performance will take place.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: inherit;margin-bottom:20px;padding:0px;border-width:0px;font-style: inherit;font-variant: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-family: inherit;vertical-align: baseline;"">3) The security that these works will be heard time and time again (rather than performed once and then never be presented again outside of that first performance). We commissioned these works with the idea that they will be circulated within the musical circles we run and then will be performed and heard by a wide range of people.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: inherit;margin-bottom:20px;padding:0px;border-width:0px;font-style: inherit;font-variant: inherit;line-height: inherit;font-family: inherit;vertical-align: baseline;"">The pieces will be premiered on May 15, 2016 in Detroit, MI.</p>

CASM (www.casmmusic.org) is proud to present its newest partner: The B Project! 
THE B PROJECT is a creative collaborative between Flutist Brandon LePage, Harp Duo Beyond Pluck, and Percussionist Zac Brunell (of the Detroit Bureau of Sound). 
We invite YOU to join us in creating exciting, never-heard-before, new music!
We set it all up for you, all you have to say is yes.
THE DETAILS:
The B Project has commissioned three brand new works from young, up-and-coming, talented composers. Michael Lanci, Nina Shekhar, and Nathan Campbell are currently writing three pieces celebrating the unique sounds of the flute, harp and wide range of percussive instruments. Your sponsorship of this project would be used to help fund:
1) Professional Recording and editing of the three new works with ""Bass Note Productions"" during the week of May 9, 2016. These recordings will be given to the composers for their professional use (which rarely is ever done for newly composed music).
2) All business materials associated with the premiere performance including advertising, compensation to the composers for their hard work, compensation to the performers for rehearsing, practicing, and premiering the works, and any fees associated with the venue where the performance will take place.
3) The security that these works will be heard time and time again (rather than performed once and then never be presented again outside of that first performance). We commissioned these works with the idea that they will be circulated within the musical circles we run and then will be performed and heard by a wide range of people.
The pieces will be premiered on May 15, 2016 in Detroit, MI.
The pieces will further be shared in Detroit-area schools, to encourage and inspire young students!
HOW TO GET INVOLVED:
Check out the different backing levels here on our Indiegogo campaign. We've created a couple different packages for you to choose from. Of course, you can support us at any level, but we think you'll enjoy some of the perks of being involved in this project.
CASM is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts organization. Contributions for the charitable purpose of CASM must be made payable to ""Fractured Atlas"" only. Any contribution above the value of the goods and services received by the donor is tax-deductible to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
When you team up with CASM and The B Project, you're creating. You're creating something new, alive, and tangible. 
Thank you for joining this wild and joyful ride of making music, 
and thank you for your support!
See you May 15th.

<h3>About the EP and Vinyl</h3>
<p>The Feed is a rock band formed just outside of Washington, DC.  We went to the studio almost a year ago, in October 2015, and recorded six songs covering the breadth of what we do. After a long mixing and mastering process, we're finally ready to share it with the world, and need your help to get it out there!  The EP is named Dwelling, and we have decided to release this batch of music in two ways: the full six-song EP as a digital download for listening on a variety of devices, and a 7-inch vinyl record for those who like to get physical.  The 7-inch features ""Weeds"", ""No Brain"" and ""Pound it Out"".<br/><br/>You can listen to two tracks from the 7-inch vinyl streaming right now: <br/><strong>Weeds</strong> - <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/thefeeddc/weeds"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://soundcloud.com/thefeeddc/weeds</a><br/><strong>Pound It Out</strong> - <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/thefeeddc/pound-it-out"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://soundcloud.com/thefeeddc/pound-it-out</a>!<br/>Be sure to follow us on Soundcloud for more!<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We're Asking For</h3>
<p>We think of this campaign as a pre-order with a few special bonuses! Every single contributor will get some music. The funds will go towards final costs associated with mastering and pressing our vinyl.  Rewards include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital Download of the full EP (included with all other rewards)</li>
<li>7-inch Vinyl Record</li>
<li>Tote Bags</li>
<li>Entry to one of our live shows</li>
<li>We will bake you a delicious pie!</li>
<li>We will write a brand new song for you!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What's the Risk?</h3>
<p>Recording and Mixing of this record is completely 100% done, so you will absolutely be getting a copy of the EP in digital form the moment it's ready for release.</p>
<p>We have sent masters to the vinyl manufacturer, and expect to have them in our hands in December 2016 or shortly thereafter.  Vinyl pressing takes time, so while we can't guarantee a delivery date right now, we can guarantee it is coming.</p>
<p>As for the special rewards - live shows, home-baked pies, and custom songs - we live to write and play music (and eat!), so we will reach out to you directly and work with you to make these things happen in the months after the end of the campaign.</p>

I strongly believe in giving back to the community. Once I am done with this project, I will make sure that every dollar I make from my album I will give 10%  to any organization that i fights for child hunger around the world.

</p><p><b>Dan Currie</b></p>
<p>Hey there folks, my name is Dan Currie and I'm a musician from Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. I'm getting set to release my third solo recording, ""Heartache""! Alright! It has been seven years and a lotta heart aches since my last solo project was released and I feel that it's time to get these songs out into the world.</p>
<p> In the last year I've been a part of a few other projects that have landed me two Music PEI nominations. One is for Musician of the Year and the other for Producer of the Year. The projects I was involved in were Katie McGarry's ""Waiting On"" album, which received four Music PEI nominations; and Spencer Soloduka &amp; the Tearaways EP, which received two Music PEI nominations. I co-produced both of these albums, as well as engineering and mixing Spencer's EP.</p>
<p>""HEARTACHE""</p>
<p>I've spent the last two years in two different studios recording what I consider to be eight of my strongest songs. I've worked really hard on this project, producing it myself as well as playing most of the instruments on it. It's something I'm really proud of and really looking forward to sharing it with everyone.</p>
<p>I've been super busy getting things finalized for this project. Slugging away roofing, playing in a cover band, and any other gigs that I can find, has allowed me to fund the recording, mixing, and artwork of the album. The trouble is I'm short on money for mastering and manufacturing costs. </p>
<p>Based on quotes I've been given, after taxes, currency exchange, and shipping, it will cost about $900 for mastering and $1100 for manufacturing. So, I've decided to pre-sell the album in order to raise the $2000.</p>
<p>What this means:</p>
<p>1)You purchase my sweet awesome CD today </p>
<p>2)When my CDs arrive I will send you a copy ASAP!</p>
<p>I can't express enough, how much it would mean to me to have your support on this new venture of mine. Even if you can't purchase a copy or donate to my campaign, I'd really appreciate if you can spread the word about it! I'm really excited to share these songs with you!</p><br/></div>","Dan Currie

SDB: Vando, Steve, The Other Steve, KevinOur goal for this project is to raise $5000.  We will use 100% of funds raised to record and promote a new album that we are very excited about. Perks for those who choose to participate in this campaign include:




Early downloads of new music
Signed copies of CDs
New, exclusive SDB T-shirts
Live intimate acoustic shows or full band concerts in your home or choice of venue!
Everyone who donates at least $10 will be thanked by name in the album's liner notes!


The cost involved in the recording and printing of CDs, traveling to shows and promoting music now is greater than ever.  Your participation in this campaign gives us the resources to produce our work independently, on our terms, and provide you with the best quality music we can. With your help, we will have the ability to pay for studio time and engineers for recording, mixing and mastering, manufacture CDs, and engage campaigns to market our new music. 
Important: Please note that if you intend to receive a ""Perk"" such as a CD or T-Shirt, you will need to select the ""Perk"" rather than choose the ""Contribute Now"" option, which is intended for donations only .
Thanks for taking the time and stop by, we can't wait to get our new music to you. Until then, enjoy the first single from our last album, ""Have A Little Fun""",2.0,1,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Story Of the Arteest:
I, DJ Prime Minister a.k.a. ""The Scratch Painter"" is ready to spearhead a new frontier in turntablism. While other turntablists are out only to display their scratch skills, I use my techniques to express myself artistically. 

I coined this art form:
‘Scratchtracknology’- The fine art of scratch arrangements over Music.

I truly believe in the turntables as a musical/artistic instrument.   and have been greatly inspired by the inventors of modern day Turntablism: GrandWizzard  Theodore & Grand Master Flash(inventors of Scratch),and Kool Herc & Afrika Baambata(fathers of Electronic Music & the Modern DJ)  and the Greats: Magic Mike, Terminator X, DJ Q-Bert, Babu, Pete Rock, & DJ Premier.  I have also been influenced by the inspiration of the Great Painters like Kahlo, Joseph Ntensibe, Van Gogh, & Dali.  Turntablism is becoming a lost art, and I am an ambassador for this great art form. My mission is to display this Craft as one that transcends mere Scratching into one of Artistic Expression....   i want to release a project and film creative Videos that portray this.....


The Impact

If DJ Prime Minister the Scratch Dali Flourishes, in releasing his 'Scratchtracknology' to the world and in creating visual examples thru video that represent his art, he will inspire millions and gazillions of Human beings.  Respect for the Turntable as an instrument will Flower throughout the Land.....  Men will be proud, Kids will jump for joy, and Women will have a twinkle in their eyes.... :-p  I can see this being a positive influence on the Electronic Music Industry, music of all Genres(so many collaborations: imagine Prime performing his unique surreal scratch touch on a Kanye West track then turning around to work with Cut Copy, & Linkin Park then along side a Symphony orchestra to Scratching on a Coca Cola commercial.), The Visual Arts industry, as well as the Electronic Music Equipment industry (Turntables, Mixers, Software etc.) If the Sacred art of 'Scratchtracknology' remains Hidden from the world, Multitudes will suffer artistic boredom....

I just never thought it was realistic to even make it to the $9500, but I guess I underestimated the generosity of the music lovers of the internet! :) </p><p>So please keep donating and rest assured that <i>every single dollar will be put right into the project </i>and make a huge difference!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Claim Perks: </strong>I've prepared all these fun rewards, like an instrumental album of my favorite old Danish Christmas hymns I recorded just for this (Check out a sample <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbLoHCL90QY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>!), one-on-one guitar lessons, handwritten lyrics, studio time and much much more. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Tell Your Friends: </strong>More than anything I just want people to be involved in this project! That's why I included a $1 perk and no one should be ashamed to pick that option if you just want to hear the music and follow the process. I'll be grateful for any new backer- regardless of the amount. So please tell everyone you know about this project and keep up the great work! </p><p> </p><p><strong>In return I'd like to announce a new <u>STRETCH GOAL</u></strong>: If we can reach 15k I'm going to bring my talented film maker friends into the desert with us to capture photos and video of the whole process. The record we're going to make is without a doubt going to reflect the magic of the surroundings (check out pictures from the <a href=""https://www.gatostrail.com/main-gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">studio</a> to see what I mean), but I would love to also be able to share the visual side of this project with you. </p><p> </p><p>I'm absolutely blown away by the support you all have shown for this project, and I'm overflowing with gratitude and inspiration!</p><p> </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>My name is Anders Mouridsen, and I'm so glad you're reading this!<br/><br/>After being a musical mercenary for the past 14 years with artists like John Fogerty, Cam, Taylor Swift, Tim Timebomb, P!nk, Smokey Robinson and many others I finally have the <strong>songs</strong>, the <strong>band</strong> and the <strong>sound</strong> ready for my very own full-length record. <strong>I'm so inspired I can hardly sleep at night!</strong></p><p> </p><p>The video above pretty much sums it all up, but if you keep reading you can find some more information about me and my vision for this project. Please browse through it and let me know if you have any questions! And don't forget to <strong>check out all the fun perks I've come up with as well!</strong></p><p><br/><strong>MY SECRET TRICK... Shhhh!</strong></p><p> </p><p>From personal and professional experience I've found that the quality of a recording, more than any other factor, <strong>comes down to how people are feeling while they're recording it</strong>. That's why I want to bring this project into the desert, where we all feel so inspired. Check out the studio at <strong><a href=""http://www.gatostrail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.gatostrail.com</a></strong> , and I'm sure you'll see what I mean. It's truly a unique place with beautiful magical surroundings and some vibey equipment that we will be milking for every drop of inspiration. Traditional recording studios can be so sterile and soulless and most often the music you record ends up reflecting that.</p><p><br/><strong>THE SOUND</strong></p><p><br/>At the core of all of this will be my <strong>lyrics</strong>. Whether I'm working on my own music someone else's, that has always been the center of it all for me. In my musical universe everything from the chords and melody to the guitar sound or the particular microphone used on the snare drum <strong>has to serve the basic function of drawing you in to the universe of the lyric and the story that is being told</strong>.</p><p>Vocally I try my hardest to practice what I've been telling other singers for years and <strong>strip away all the BS</strong> and focus all my efforts on being as honest and vulnerable as I possibly can. If someone wants to hear vocal chops, all they have to do is turn on the TV or go on Youtube. <strong>Real honesty</strong> is much harder to come by, and that's what I strive for every time I open my mouth. This is why it's even more important to make this record with people that I trust on a deep level!</p><p> </p><p>Through my work as a musician, I've been lucky enough to make close friends who happen to be insanely talented musicians. There's nothing wrong with music that's made on a laptop, but I'm proud to have a <strong>real band who can play together in a room</strong>. I want to capture the magic of a real performance and then combine that with all the dreamy ethereal elements that take the listener from the intimate studio setting and <strong>all the way to outer space</strong>!</p><p> </p><p><strong>THE MOOD</strong></p><p> </p><p>As I said in the video, I want the mood the record to be soaked in Scandinavian mystique and emotional ambiguity. By this I mean that I want the music to reflect the <strong>complicated and often conflicting emotions we all feel every day</strong>. Something extremely sad can also be the most beautiful, and the people we love also drives us insane at times. Music should reflect these contrasts, and if there's anything I've gained from growing up in Scandinavia it's a <strong>complete zero-tolerance for music that is oversimplifying things</strong>. I can understand how people want music that makes them feel like things (like love) are simple for a brief moment. But that has never appealed to me.</p><p> </p><p>I mention Bon Iver's first album, because it is the perfect example of the secret trick I mentioned in the beginning. That record is not “expensive” sounding or high fidelity in any way. It's just him in his cabin with some basic gear and a broken heart.<strong> And it WORKS! Purely because of how he was feeling when he was recording it.</strong></p><p> </p><p>The third record I mention is Daniel Lanois' Belladonna, which is an amazing instrumental record. I really connected with this record, when I was on a writing retreat with Cam (Country singer) at a beautiful ranch in Joshua Tree. After a long and successful day of writing (I was in the desert after all!), I sat on the porch and watched the sun set over the landscape while listening to this whole record, beginning to end. It all blended together in the most inspiring way - another example of the synergy between music and places.</p><p> </p><p><strong>CAN I HEAR SOMETHING?</strong></p><p> </p><p>Absolutely! Follow me on Instagram<strong> @andersmou</strong> , where I'll be posting clips regularly throughout this campaign.</p><p><a href=""https://youtu.be/TShuTf4vRQU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here</a>'s a link to the full video of the <strong>song “Time Keeps”</strong> that I play a bit of in the video. It's a brutally honest song about longing for the past and trying to hold onto the fleeting moments of peace in a fast-paced and often stressful life.</p><p><a href=""https://youtu.be/n3rLpWdGMBM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here</a>'s another <strong>song called “Alive”</strong>. I wrote this one for my wife about the ups and downs in a life full of love.</p><p>If you want to dig even deeper (which I hope you do!) you can check out some of my work as a guitarist, songwriter and producer on my website <strong><a href=""http://www.andersmouridsen.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.andersmouridsen.com</a></strong> .</p><p> </p><p><strong>SO WHERE DO I COME IN?</strong></p><p> </p><p>One thing that I've consistently experienced is that none of the music I've ever made feels complete before it has been received and understood by a real human on the other end. No matter how good it may be. The thing that inspires me more than anything is the <strong>connection with other people through the music</strong>. We on the stage and in the studio share our innermost thoughts and feelings and when we do it right, you hear and see yourselves in it.<br/> </p><p><strong>I want you to be a part of this!</strong> You already are if you're reading this. You're part of the inspiration, motivation and accountability, and I promise <strong>I won't let you down</strong>!</p><p><br/>... And of course, I'm <strong>very much hoping that you'll donate any amount that feels comfortable to you</strong> in order to help me bring this music into the world. I have spent my entire professional life making music and I have nothing but confidence we can make something here that you will truly appreciate and enjoy. And even more so if you're invested in it and helped bring it to life!</p><p> </p><p>I'm excited to invest a great deal of money in this, but I do need some help with the budget, because making great music with the real gear and amazing people is really expensive.</p><p><br/><strong>WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Most importantly - Amazing Talent: $7000</strong></p><p>It goes without saying that if you want <strong>to make a great record, you need really great people</strong>.

I just never thought it was realistic to even make it to the $9500, but I guess I underestimated the generosity of the music lovers of the internet! :) So please keep donating and rest assured that every single dollar will be put right into the project and make a huge difference! Claim Perks: I've prepared all these fun rewards, like an instrumental album of my favorite old Danish Christmas hymns I recorded just for this (Check out a sample here!), one-on-one guitar lessons, handwritten lyrics, studio time and much much more.  Tell Your Friends: More than anything I just want people to be involved in this project! That's why I included a $1 perk and no one should be ashamed to pick that option if you just want to hear the music and follow the process. I'll be grateful for any new backer- regardless of the amount. So please tell everyone you know about this project and keep up the great work!  In return I'd like to announce a new STRETCH GOAL: If we can reach 15k I'm going to bring my talented film maker friends into the desert with us to capture photos and video of the whole process. The record we're going to make is without a doubt going to reflect the magic of the surroundings (check out pictures from the studio to see what I mean), but I would love to also be able to share the visual side of this project with you.  I'm absolutely blown away by the support you all have shown for this project, and I'm overflowing with gratitude and inspiration! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------My name is Anders Mouridsen, and I'm so glad you're reading this!After being a musical mercenary for the past 14 years with artists like John Fogerty, Cam, Taylor Swift, Tim Timebomb, P!nk, Smokey Robinson and many others I finally have the songs, the band and the sound ready for my very own full-length record. I'm so inspired I can hardly sleep at night! The video above pretty much sums it all up, but if you keep reading you can find some more information about me and my vision for this project. Please browse through it and let me know if you have any questions! And don't forget to check out all the fun perks I've come up with as well!MY SECRET TRICK... Shhhh! From personal and professional experience I've found that the quality of a recording, more than any other factor, comes down to how people are feeling while they're recording it. That's why I want to bring this project into the desert, where we all feel so inspired. Check out the studio at www.gatostrail.com , and I'm sure you'll see what I mean. It's truly a unique place with beautiful magical surroundings and some vibey equipment that we will be milking for every drop of inspiration. Traditional recording studios can be so sterile and soulless and most often the music you record ends up reflecting that.THE SOUNDAt the core of all of this will be my lyrics. Whether I'm working on my own music someone else's, that has always been the center of it all for me. In my musical universe everything from the chords and melody to the guitar sound or the particular microphone used on the snare drum has to serve the basic function of drawing you in to the universe of the lyric and the story that is being told.Vocally I try my hardest to practice what I've been telling other singers for years and strip away all the BS and focus all my efforts on being as honest and vulnerable as I possibly can. If someone wants to hear vocal chops, all they have to do is turn on the TV or go on Youtube. Real honesty is much harder to come by, and that's what I strive for every time I open my mouth. This is why it's even more important to make this record with people that I trust on a deep level! Through my work as a musician, I've been lucky enough to make close friends who happen to be insanely talented musicians. There's nothing wrong with music that's made on a laptop, but I'm proud to have a real band who can play together in a room. I want to capture the magic of a real performance and then combine that with all the dreamy ethereal elements that take the listener from the intimate studio setting and all the way to outer space! THE MOOD As I said in the video, I want the mood the record to be soaked in Scandinavian mystique and emotional ambiguity. By this I mean that I want the music to reflect the complicated and often conflicting emotions we all feel every day. Something extremely sad can also be the most beautiful, and the people we love also drives us insane at times. Music should reflect these contrasts, and if there's anything I've gained from growing up in Scandinavia it's a complete zero-tolerance for music that is oversimplifying things. I can understand how people want music that makes them feel like things (like love) are simple for a brief moment. But that has never appealed to me. I mention Bon Iver's first album, because it is the perfect example of the secret trick I mentioned in the beginning. That record is not “expensive” sounding or high fidelity in any way. It's just him in his cabin with some basic gear and a broken heart. And it WORKS! Purely because of how he was feeling when he was recording it. The third record I mention is Daniel Lanois' Belladonna, which is an amazing instrumental record. I really connected with this record, when I was on a writing retreat with Cam (Country singer) at a beautiful ranch in Joshua Tree. After a long and successful day of writing (I was in the desert after all!), I sat on the porch and watched the sun set over the landscape while listening to this whole record, beginning to end. It all blended together in the most inspiring way - another example of the synergy between music and places. CAN I HEAR SOMETHING? Absolutely! Follow me on Instagram @andersmou , where I'll be posting clips regularly throughout this campaign.Here's a link to the full video of the song “Time Keeps” that I play a bit of in the video. It's a brutally honest song about longing for the past and trying to hold onto the fleeting moments of peace in a fast-paced and often stressful life.Here's another song called “Alive”. I wrote this one for my wife about the ups and downs in a life full of love.If you want to dig even deeper (which I hope you do!) you can check out some of my work as a guitarist, songwriter and producer on my website www.andersmouridsen.com . SO WHERE DO I COME IN? One thing that I've consistently experienced is that none of the music I've ever made feels complete before it has been received and understood by a real human on the other end. No matter how good it may be. The thing that inspires me more than anything is the connection with other people through the music. We on the stage and in the studio share our innermost thoughts and feelings and when we do it right, you hear and see yourselves in it. I want you to be a part of this! You already are if you're reading this. You're part of the inspiration, motivation and accountability, and I promise I won't let you down!... And of course, I'm very much hoping that you'll donate any amount that feels comfortable to you in order to help me bring this music into the world. I have spent my entire professional life making music and I have nothing but confidence we can make something here that you will truly appreciate and enjoy. And even more so if you're invested in it and helped bring it to life! I'm excited to invest a great deal of money in this, but I do need some help with the budget, because making great music with the real gear and amazing people is really expensive.WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO? Most importantly - Amazing Talent: $7000It goes without saying that if you want to make a great record, you need really great people. I'm so fortunate to be friends with some world-class musicians who're ready to go fearlessly into the desert with me- but I still want to and need to pay them. They're doing it for a fraction of their normal rates, but it still adds up. I'm paying 5 people $1400 for the week, so that amounts to $7000. Secondly - Studio Time: $3500Far too often musicians and artists are so focused on recording their “handheld” instruments that they forget they're sitting one giant instrument, which is the recording studio itself.

<div>Hey all,</div>
<p> </p>
<p>We are r&amp;b/hip hop duo Elenele. Liana Harper and Landz started working together in 2009 recording ""Keep It Movin'"", a single off of Liana Harper’s debut EP <em>My Journey Vol. I</em>.   ""Keep It Movin'"" was about not letting a relationship or someone who may want a relationship with you to bring you down.  It was a great success and went on to be the most downloaded single.  Last year we had the opportunity to write for a webseries, titled Enlightment's The Unknown Live Talk Show.  We collaborated with a great friend and beat maker Arthur Retiz to create the song ""Shine.""  We wanted to have an uptempo positive song that will not only make you dance but set your spirit free.  ""Shine"" has received a lot of great feedback and people have asked us where this song was headed and we knew we had to do more with it. </p>
<p>So we've decided to create a project together....a blend of hip hop and r&amp;b that blends great music with positive messages.  We are currently writing that EP now with a release time slated for August/September.  But you know how it is....every artist has that one great music video that keeps you wanting more and eagerly waiting for that CD to come out.  The kind of video that creates buzz and anticipation.  This is what we'd like to do with ""Shine.""  </p>
<p>We've got great ideas and an amazing location in mind.  However, there's so much more to a music video than just a cool location and a camera...and this is where we need your help.  With your donation you can help us get:</p>
<p>location rental</p>

<p>The Arootsakoostik Music Festival will return for its 6<sup>th</sup> year on Saturday, July 7, 2012 at Thomas Park in New Sweden, Maine.  After another very successful event in 2011, we plan to continue our tradition of bringing some of the best talent from Maine up to the County.

<p>We are also very proud to continue to donate our proceeds to local charities.  Last year we raised $500 for Thomas Park and another $500 for the Caribou Children’s Museum, we hope to be able to make another donation to them this year.  We have also donated over $2,500 to Thomas Park to help aid in restoration and maintenance since we started this event.  In the past, we have raised money and awareness for the Children’s Make-A-Wish foundation, as well as several local food pantries.  As always we will be holding a canned food drive at the event to further help out the local community. </p>
<p>Arootsakoostik has blossomed into a beautiful event.  The Bangor Daily news has called us one of the 50 best things to do in the summer.  We are very proud and honored to be able to continue to bring such a diverse, entertaining, and vital event to our neck of the woods.  We have people travel from all over Maine and well beyond to attend each year.  A lot of folks have begun planning their summer vacations to Northern Maine specifically for this family event. There truly is nothing else like us in the area. </p>
<p>Our event is put on by a small grass roots team of good people with pure intentions who donate a lot of time and effort for the good of everyone.  We could not do this without the help and support of all involved.  As we have grown, so have our production expenses.  We are asking for the help of our local community to stage this year’s event.  Your donation would help feed our volunteers and musicians and help pay for printing and advertising costs, as well as basic promotional expenses (toilets, sound equipment, etc.), a lot of people have worked hard to get this event established, recognized and respected; we should all be proud and continue to nurture it so it can thrive for many years to come.  It truly is a win-win situation for Aroostook County. </p>
