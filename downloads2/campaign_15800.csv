<p>Everyone's Climbing Tree (ECT) is a not-for-profit company and family run community arts centre  in Wood Green, North London. ECT was established by the Sabbagh family after the death of local community figure, and their father and husband Mustapha Sabbagh in 2010. Since then we have been curating community workshops and events for people of all ages and backgrounds.</p>
<p>Through alternative teaching techniques and a strong ethos of communal learning we have developed a reputation for youth engagement. Supported by Youth Music and Arts Council England our programme of West African percussion, often working with young people excluded from mainstream education, has had a massive impact. Over the past seven years we have assisted many young people, helping them grow into the resilient and positive young adults they are today.</p>

<p>We are very enthusiastic about our campaign but we also know that you always need a Plan B. So if we do not reach our entire goal we will fix the basic essentials such as toilets, electricity and insulation. As always we will continue to work creatively on a shoe string and raise funds to do the things we dream of for our local area and Everyone's Climbing Tree. On the other hand if we raise more than intended we will put the money into recording a second cross-cultural album. Currently working titles are ""Dakar 2 London II"" or ""London 2 Dakar"" let us know if you have any suggestions!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The ECT team although small and family based are deeply intuitive problem solvers, thinking outside the box, with an abundance of creativity. As residents of the Borough of Haringey for over 30 years we quietly continue to develop and deliver projects that have had a massive impact on the lives of local people.  If you look back at what we have achieved so far imagine what we can do in the future.

ECT was established by the Sabbagh family after the death of local community figure, and their father and husband Mustapha Sabbagh in 2010.

I think his work is an important project of cultural succession to the next generation. He once said to me, “I work with you, not with that company anymore. So, if you are gone, no one remains.” The master of soul chose to trust me very much saying finally “this project would go only with you.”  </p><p>The project I need to revive with your support is a three-part mini-documentary, a story about afro peruvian culture, and a show. Tragedy for this perfect project of our dreams happened 4 years ago.  It was too late to cancel a film shoot that was already coordinated through the company, paid in full by me, and it has remained my private debt.  We were scammed by the former producer who was prosecuted but not facing justice to this day.   </p><p><strong>All to inherit the traditional culture​</strong></p><p>Today my project needs me in every way. I have to revive this project.  Unfortunately in Peru there is almost no system for inheriting traditional culture and therefore, everything is changing and flowing in the commercial direction. The creators and sustainers of the Afro-Peruvian culture are lamenting this situation. I am very concerned that this wonderful true tradition could face extinction.  All the members are very excited to restart. It is full of very positive energy. The only thing we need is the funds. Afro-Peruvian music has some typical rhythms. The Kota-Kunde 1 of the Zapateo project was asleep in 2015 and the Kota-Kunde 2 of Festejo, plans to shoot new this year.  These are two rhythm documentaries that need funding to reach their true potential, an opportunity that is critical at the cusp of this historical turning point. This project aims to pass on the history and culture of Afro-Peruvian through music and dance. We are confident as it has already received offers for exhibitions from public schools and educational institutions. Peruvian children are divided by a huge wage gap. The children playing soccer on the roadside often cannot afford cleats, yet they can have dreams of becoming world-class soccer players.  Just like a successful soccer player is regarded as a role model for children across many socioeconomic classes, Kota-Kunde can also be a model for our children.  It is fun to dance with the rhythm of Cajon without spending a lot of money, yielding a chance to dream and express.  I think such cultural foundation leads us to both recognize and strengthen its identity. We want all to inherit the traditional culture, give dreams, and cultivate the foundation of the power to live through.</p><p><strong>Profile of producer</strong></p><p>I was born in Tokyo and had a fortunate home environment where I could always listen to Western music. I started playing musical instruments at the age of three and became familiar with Western pop music as well. I became fond of Bossa Nova, Samba, Funk, Reggae, Jazz, Blues, Salsa, and all kinds of music. I was particularly fascinated by Latin music.  This led me to desire a life in South America. I visited Peru for the first time in 1999 and was fascinated by the energy of land and people. My home is now in Peru. Here I encountered Afro-Peruvian music and realized that all of my favorite music was of African roots.</p><p>In this dream land of mine my life goes on in unexpected ways.  While I enjoyed this unique endeavor, I had to go through divorce in 2011. I endured the divorce with my two daughters whilst also developing and fighting cancer. Needless to say I had a hard time raising two young daughters and surviving in a foreign land.   Local Peruvian friends and Afro-Peruvian friends helped feed energy to me and my family through their Peruvian music.  It was my confirmation; the world of Afro-Peruvian music and dance had been my life.  I have been with these soulful musical people and have been interacting with them like true families.</p><p><strong>My Passion</strong></p><p>My passion has extended and in 2015, a Peruvian woman introduced by a musician offered me a position as a music director.   Excitingly, I became a partner of the company.  I passionately, in the name of the art and of spreading Peruvian art to the world started to produce some groups that I selected a fusion of Peruvian traditional and contemporary music. However, the woman has teamed up with a famous French television director and took the precious money which had been funded to me from many heartfelt and vulnerable people. I still do not want to give up. </p><p><strong>For next generation</strong></p><p>I want to make this culture known not only in Peru, but also across the world. I see great power in the power and value of this cultural tradition and I hope others can share in that vision.  Thank you for financing Kota-Kunde, and believing in me and my fellow Afro-Peruvian musicians and feeding a dream to revive dormant but lively soulful cultures for the  next generation.  </p><p><strong>Special Thanks to </strong></p><p>Last but not least, I give a mention of Yuko N. Taylor, a classmate who cooperated with this project who has seen the fusion of African culture and modern culture in the southern part of North America through the eyes of an artist and the eyes of a producer. </p><p><i><u><strong>日本語</strong></u></i></p><p><strong>コタクンデとは？</strong></p><p>文化継承・教育プロジェクト。 アフロペルービアンの歴史と伝統文化を、音楽やダンスを通して、広く深く次世代に継承していく、また世界に広めていくためのプロジェクト。コタクンデ（美しい心の意味）は、アフロペルービアン文化の世界では知らない人はいない巨匠、ラロ・イスキエルドと彼の選んだ次世代のリーダーたちのユニットです。このプロジェクトはミニドキュメンタリー、巨匠のアフロペルービアン文化の話（質問・回答形式）、ショーの３部構成です。教育機関や文化イベントに提供していきます。 アフロペルービアン音楽には、大きく分けると４つの典型的なリズムがありますが、そのうちの２つ、サパテオ（タップダンス）のコタクンデ１、フェステホのコタクンデ２、今年はまずはこの２つにフォーカスします。</p><p><strong>なぜ資金が必要か</strong></p><p>アフロペルービアンの音楽やダンスは、パーティーやイベントなどには必ず使われ、ペルー全国の人が知っています。ただそれは、商業的なものに形を変えてしまっており、本来のものとかけ離れていっています。残念ながら、ペルーには芸術的な伝統文化を継承するシステムが、ほぼ存在しません。アフロペルー文化の巨匠たちは2世の世代にあたり、すでに高齢です。このままでは、この伝統文化は正しく継承できず、絶えてしまいます。前出の２つのテーマのミニドキュメンタリー完成のための資金が必要です。</p><p><strong>お礼のアイテム（リターン）</strong></p><p>プロジェクトの目的に合わせて、みなさまに知っていただき、楽しんでいただけるあるいは学んでいただけるお礼を中心にご用意しています。特に一般の方に馴染みやすいのは、・Jarana Criolla 15$(プライベートライブビデオ)　・Video Cajon Lesson with musica 50$（カホンレクチャーを含むライブビデオ）だと思います。カホンを習得したい方には、レッスンビデオやバーチャルレッスンがあります。また、文化イベント主催者の方向けリターンもございます。すべて各々をクリックすると、日本語での詳細説明が見られます。また、BACK ITをクリックすると、US＄で自由に金額を設定していただける募金もございます。</p><p><strong>伝統文化の継承</strong></p><p>残念ながら、ペルーでは伝統文化を継承していくというシステムや考え方がほとんどなく、すべて形を変えて商業的な方向に流れてしまっています。この文化の巨匠たちもその状況を大変嘆いており、私もこの素晴らしい伝統が違った形でしか世に出ていないことを大変残念に思っています。資金面の問題で、しばらく休眠状態でしたが、巨匠たち（２世）が近年次々にこの世を去り、このままでは本当にこの文化が立ち消えてしまうので、一念発起し再開しました。メンバー（3世、4世）も再スタートに向けて、ポジティブなエネルギーでいっぱいです。</p><p><strong>アイデンティティと子供達の夢</strong></p><p>貧富の差が激しいペルーの子供たち。教育を受けることも含め、お金が無いと何もできない。お金がある人は外国へ移住するという考え方が根づいています。教育も然り。教養を養う教育ではなく、働くことができるための教育という印象を受けます。ヒーローはサッカー選手で、スパイクも買えなかった道端でサッカーをしている子供たちの中から、世界に通用するサッカー選手が輩出されています。サッカー選手に憧れてサッカーをするように、コタクンデも子供たちの手本となり、お金をかけなくてもカホンを叩いたり、踊ったりすることが楽しいことだと知ってもらい、夢を持って欲しいと思います。それが、アイデンティティの自覚と自信につながっていくと思います。正しい伝統文化を継承し、夢を与え、文化を通して生きる力の基礎を養って欲しいと思っています。音楽やダンスを通じて、広く深くアフロペルービアンの歴史と文化を継承していくためのこのプロジェクト、既に公立学校や教育機関よりオファーをいただいています。また、外国人の私がこの文化の持つエネルギーに生きる力をもらっているように、ペルー国内のみならず、世界にもこの文化を広く知ってもらい、伝えていきたいと思っています。</p><p><b>終わりに</b></p><p>最後になりましたが、このプロジェクトの協力者、北米の南部でアフリカンカルチャーと現代文化との融合を、時にアーティストの目で、時にプロデユーサーの目で見ている同級生、ユウコ・野上・テーラーさんに心から感謝をいたします。</p><p><strong><i><u>ESPAÑOL</u></i></strong></p><p><strong>Qué es Kota-Kunde?</strong></p><p>Kota-Kunde es un producto del inigualable maestro de la cultura afroperuana, el maestro Lalo Izquierdo y sus líderes seleccionados de la próxima generación. Creo que su trabajo es un importante proyecto de sucesión cultural para la próxima generación. Una vez me dijo: “Trabajo contigo, ya no con esa compañía. Entonces, si te has ido, no queda nadie. El maestro del alma decidió confiar mucho en mí y dijo finalmente que ""este proyecto iría solo contigo"". </p><p>El proyecto que necesito revivir con su apoyo es un mini documental de tres partes, una historia sobre cultura afroperuana  y un espectáculo. La tragedia para este perfecto proyecto de nuestros sueños sucedió hace 4 años. Era demasiado tarde para cancelar una filmación que ya había sido coordinada a través de la compañía, pagada en su totalidad por mí, y que sigue siendo mi deuda privada. Fuimos estafados por el ex productora que fue procesado pero que no enfrenta a la justicia hasta el día de hoy. </p><p><strong>Heredar la cultura tradicional</strong></p><p>Hoy mi proyecto me necesita en todos los sentidos. Tengo que revivir este proyecto. Desafortunadamente, en Perú casi no existe un sistema para heredar la cultura tradicional y, por lo tanto, todo está cambiando y fluyendo en la dirección comercial. Los creadores y sostenedores de la cultura afroperuana lamentan esta situación. Me preocupa mucho que esta maravillosa y verdadera tradición pueda enfrentar la extinción. Todos los miembros están muy emocionados de reiniciar. Está lleno de energía muy positiva. Lo único que necesitamos son los fondos. La música afroperuana tiene algunos ritmos típicos. El Kota-Kunde 1 del proyecto Zapateo estaba dormido en 2015 y el Kota-Kunde 2 de Festejo, planea disparar de nuevo este año. Estos son dos documentales de ritmo que necesitan financiación para alcanzar su verdadero potencial, una oportunidad que es crítica en la cúspide de este punto de inflexión histórico. Este proyecto tiene como objetivo transmitir la historia y la cultura de los afroperuanos a través de la música y la danza. Estamos seguros de que ya ha recibido ofertas para exposiciones de escuelas públicas e instituciones educativas. Los niños peruanos están divididos por una enorme brecha salarial. Los niños que juegan fútbol en la carretera a menudo no pueden pagar chimpunes, pero pueden soñar con convertirse en jugadores de fútbol de clase mundial. Al igual que un jugador de fútbol exitoso es considerado como un modelo a seguir para los niños en muchas clases socioeconómicas, Kota-Kunde también puede ser un modelo para nuestros hijos. Es divertido bailar al ritmo de Cajon sin gastar mucho dinero, dando la oportunidad de soñar y expresarse. Creo que este fundamento cultural nos lleva a reconocer y fortalecer su identidad. Queremos que todos hereden la cultura tradicional, dar sueños y cultiven los cimientos del poder de vivir. </p><p><strong>Perfil de productora</strong></p><p>Nací en Tokio y afortunadamente tenía un ambiente hogareño donde siempre podía escuchar música occidental. Comencé a tocar instrumentos musicales a la edad de tres años y también me familiarice con la música pop occidental. Me enamoré de Bossa Nova, Samba, Funk, Reggae, Jazz, Blues, Salsa y todo tipo de música. Estaba particularmente fascinada por la música latina. Esto me llevó a desear una vida en América del Sur. Visité Perú por primera vez en 1999 y me fascinó la energía de la tierra y la gente. Mi casa ahora está en Perú. Aquí encontré música afroperuana y me di cuenta de que toda mi música favorita era de raíces africanas. </p><p>En esta tierra de mis sueños, mi vida continúa de maneras inesperadas. Si bien disfruté este esfuerzo único, tuve que pasar por un divorcio en 2011. Soporté el divorcio con mis dos hijas mientras también combatía el cáncer. No hace falta decir que me costó mucho criar a dos hijas jóvenes y sobrevivir en un país extranjero. Amigos locales peruanos y amigos afroperuanos nos ayudaron a alimentarme a mí y a mi familia a través de su música peruana. Fue mi confirmación; El mundo de la música y el baile afroperuano había sido mi vida. He estado con estas personas musicales conmovedoras y he estado interactuando con ellos como verdaderos familiares.</p><p><strong>Mi pasión</strong></p><p>Mi pasión se extendió y en 2015, una mujer peruana presentada por un músico me ofreció un puesto como directora musical. Emocionantemente, me convertí en socia de la empresa. Yo apasionadamente, en nombre del arte y de difundir el arte peruano al mundo, comencé a producir grupos y seleccioné una fusión de música peruana tradicional y contemporánea. Sin embargo, la mujer se asoció con un famoso director de televisión francés y tomó el precioso dinero que me habían financiado muchas personas sinceras y vulnerables. Todavía no quiero rendirme. </p><p><strong>La próxima generación</strong></p><p>Quiero dar a conocer esta cultura no solo en Perú, sino también en todo el mundo. Veo un gran poder en el poder y el valor de esta tradición cultural y espero que otros puedan compartir esa visión. Gracias por financiar a Kota-Kunde, y por creer en mí y en mis compañeros músicos afroperuanos y en alimentar un sueño para revivir culturas latentes pero vivas y conmovedoras para la próxima generación. </p><p><strong>Agradecimiento</strong></p><p>Por último, pero no menos importante, menciono a Yuko N. Taylor, una compañero del colegio que cooperó con este proyecto que ha visto la fusión de la cultura africana y la cultura moderna en la parte sur de América del Norte a través de la vista de una artista y la vista de una productora.</p></div>","ENGLISH, 日本語, ESPAÑOLENGLISHWhat is Kota-KundeKota-Kunde is a product of the unrivaled master of the Afro-Peruvian culture, Maestro Lalo Izquierdo and his selected leaders of the next generation.

I became fond of Bossa Nova, Samba, Funk, Reggae, Jazz, Blues, Salsa, and all kinds of music. I was particularly fascinated by Latin music.  This led me to desire a life in South America. I visited Peru for the first time in 1999 and was fascinated by the energy of land and people. My home is now in Peru. Here I encountered Afro-Peruvian music and realized that all of my favorite music was of African roots.In this dream land of mine my life goes on in unexpected ways.  While I enjoyed this unique endeavor, I had to go through divorce in 2011. I endured the divorce with my two daughters whilst also developing and fighting cancer. Needless to say I had a hard time raising two young daughters and surviving in a foreign land.   Local Peruvian friends and Afro-Peruvian friends helped feed energy to me and my family through their Peruvian music.  It was my confirmation; the world of Afro-Peruvian music and dance had been my life.  I have been with these soulful musical people and have been interacting with them like true families.My PassionMy passion has extended and in 2015, a Peruvian woman introduced by a musician offered me a position as a music director.   Excitingly, I became a partner of the company.  I passionately, in the name of the art and of spreading Peruvian art to the world started to produce some groups that I selected a fusion of Peruvian traditional and contemporary music. However, the woman has teamed up with a famous French television director and took the precious money which had been funded to me from many heartfelt and vulnerable people. I still do not want to give up. For next generationI want to make this culture known not only in Peru, but also across the world. I see great power in the power and value of this cultural tradition and I hope others can share in that vision.  Thank you for financing Kota-Kunde, and believing in me and my fellow Afro-Peruvian musicians and feeding a dream to revive dormant but lively soulful cultures for the  next generation.  Special Thanks to Last but not least, I give a mention of Yuko N. Taylor, a classmate who cooperated with this project who has seen the fusion of African culture and modern culture in the southern part of North America through the eyes of an artist and the eyes of a producer. 日本語コタクンデとは？文化継承・教育プロジェクト。 アフロペルービアンの歴史と伝統文化を、音楽やダンスを通して、広く深く次世代に継承していく、また世界に広めていくためのプロジェクト。コタクンデ（美しい心の意味）は、アフロペルービアン文化の世界では知らない人はいない巨匠、ラロ・イスキエルドと彼の選んだ次世代のリーダーたちのユニットです。このプロジェクトはミニドキュメンタリー、巨匠のアフロペルービアン文化の話（質問・回答形式）、ショーの３部構成です。教育機関や文化イベントに提供していきます。 アフロペルービアン音楽には、大きく分けると４つの典型的なリズムがありますが、そのうちの２つ、サパテオ（タップダンス）のコタクンデ１、フェステホのコタクンデ２、今年はまずはこの２つにフォーカスします。なぜ資金が必要かアフロペルービアンの音楽やダンスは、パーティーやイベントなどには必ず使われ、ペルー全国の人が知っています。ただそれは、商業的なものに形を変えてしまっており、本来のものとかけ離れていっています。残念ながら、ペルーには芸術的な伝統文化を継承するシステムが、ほぼ存在しません。アフロペルー文化の巨匠たちは2世の世代にあたり、すでに高齢です。このままでは、この伝統文化は正しく継承できず、絶えてしまいます。前出の２つのテーマのミニドキュメンタリー完成のための資金が必要です。お礼のアイテム（リターン）プロジェクトの目的に合わせて、みなさまに知っていただき、楽しんでいただけるあるいは学んでいただけるお礼を中心にご用意しています。特に一般の方に馴染みやすいのは、・Jarana Criolla 15$(プライベートライブビデオ)　・Video Cajon Lesson with musica 50$（カホンレクチャーを含むライブビデオ）だと思います。カホンを習得したい方には、レッスンビデオやバーチャルレッスンがあります。また、文化イベント主催者の方向けリターンもございます。すべて各々をクリックすると、日本語での詳細説明が見られます。また、BACK ITをクリックすると、US＄で自由に金額を設定していただける募金もございます。伝統文化の継承残念ながら、ペルーでは伝統文化を継承していくというシステムや考え方がほとんどなく、すべて形を変えて商業的な方向に流れてしまっています。この文化の巨匠たちもその状況を大変嘆いており、私もこの素晴らしい伝統が違った形でしか世に出ていないことを大変残念に思っています。資金面の問題で、しばらく休眠状態でしたが、巨匠たち（２世）が近年次々にこの世を去り、このままでは本当にこの文化が立ち消えてしまうので、一念発起し再開しました。メンバー（3世、4世）も再スタートに向けて、ポジティブなエネルギーでいっぱいです。アイデンティティと子供達の夢貧富の差が激しいペルーの子供たち。教育を受けることも含め、お金が無いと何もできない。お金がある人は外国へ移住するという考え方が根づいています。教育も然り。教養を養う教育ではなく、働くことができるための教育という印象を受けます。ヒーローはサッカー選手で、スパイクも買えなかった道端でサッカーをしている子供たちの中から、世界に通用するサッカー選手が輩出されています。サッカー選手に憧れてサッカーをするように、コタクンデも子供たちの手本となり、お金をかけなくてもカホンを叩いたり、踊ったりすることが楽しいことだと知ってもらい、夢を持って欲しいと思います。それが、アイデンティティの自覚と自信につながっていくと思います。正しい伝統文化を継承し、夢を与え、文化を通して生きる力の基礎を養って欲しいと思っています。音楽やダンスを通じて、広く深くアフロペルービアンの歴史と文化を継承していくためのこのプロジェクト、既に公立学校や教育機関よりオファーをいただいています。また、外国人の私がこの文化の持つエネルギーに生きる力をもらっているように、ペルー国内のみならず、世界にもこの文化を広く知ってもらい、伝えていきたいと思っています。終わりに最後になりましたが、このプロジェクトの協力者、北米の南部でアフリカンカルチャーと現代文化との融合を、時にアーティストの目で、時にプロデユーサーの目で見ている同級生、ユウコ・野上・テーラーさんに心から感謝をいたします。ESPAÑOLQué es Kota-Kunde?Kota-Kunde es un producto del inigualable maestro de la cultura afroperuana, el maestro Lalo Izquierdo y sus líderes seleccionados de la próxima generación. Creo que su trabajo es un importante proyecto de sucesión cultural para la próxima generación. Una vez me dijo: “Trabajo contigo, ya no con esa compañía. Entonces, si te has ido, no queda nadie. El maestro del alma decidió confiar mucho en mí y dijo finalmente que ""este proyecto iría solo contigo"". El proyecto que necesito revivir con su apoyo es un mini documental de tres partes, una historia sobre cultura afroperuana  y un espectáculo. La tragedia para este perfecto proyecto de nuestros sueños sucedió hace 4 años. Era demasiado tarde para cancelar una filmación que ya había sido coordinada a través de la compañía, pagada en su totalidad por mí, y que sigue siendo mi deuda privada. Fuimos estafados por el ex productora que fue procesado pero que no enfrenta a la justicia hasta el día de hoy. Heredar la cultura tradicionalHoy mi proyecto me necesita en todos los sentidos. Tengo que revivir este proyecto. Desafortunadamente, en Perú casi no existe un sistema para heredar la cultura tradicional y, por lo tanto, todo está cambiando y fluyendo en la dirección comercial. Los creadores y sostenedores de la cultura afroperuana lamentan esta situación. Me preocupa mucho que esta maravillosa y verdadera tradición pueda enfrentar la extinción. Todos los miembros están muy emocionados de reiniciar. Está lleno de energía muy positiva. Lo único que necesitamos son los fondos. La música afroperuana tiene algunos ritmos típicos. El Kota-Kunde 1 del proyecto Zapateo estaba dormido en 2015 y el Kota-Kunde 2 de Festejo, planea disparar de nuevo este año. Estos son dos documentales de ritmo que necesitan financiación para alcanzar su verdadero potencial, una oportunidad que es crítica en la cúspide de este punto de inflexión histórico. Este proyecto tiene como objetivo transmitir la historia y la cultura de los afroperuanos a través de la música y la danza. Estamos seguros de que ya ha recibido ofertas para exposiciones de escuelas públicas e instituciones educativas. Los niños peruanos están divididos por una enorme brecha salarial. Los niños que juegan fútbol en la carretera a menudo no pueden pagar chimpunes, pero pueden soñar con convertirse en jugadores de fútbol de clase mundial. Al igual que un jugador de fútbol exitoso es considerado como un modelo a seguir para los niños en muchas clases socioeconómicas, Kota-Kunde también puede ser un modelo para nuestros hijos. Es divertido bailar al ritmo de Cajon sin gastar mucho dinero, dando la oportunidad de soñar y expresarse. Creo que este fundamento cultural nos lleva a reconocer y fortalecer su identidad. Queremos que todos hereden la cultura tradicional, dar sueños y cultiven los cimientos del poder de vivir. Perfil de productoraNací en Tokio y afortunadamente tenía un ambiente hogareño donde siempre podía escuchar música occidental. Comencé a tocar instrumentos musicales a la edad de tres años y también me familiarice con la música pop occidental. Me enamoré de Bossa Nova, Samba, Funk, Reggae, Jazz, Blues, Salsa y todo tipo de música. Estaba particularmente fascinada por la música latina. Esto me llevó a desear una vida en América del Sur. Visité Perú por primera vez en 1999 y me fascinó la energía de la tierra y la gente. Mi casa ahora está en Perú. Aquí encontré música afroperuana y me di cuenta de que toda mi música favorita era de raíces africanas. En esta tierra de mis sueños, mi vida continúa de maneras inesperadas. Si bien disfruté este esfuerzo único, tuve que pasar por un divorcio en 2011. Soporté el divorcio con mis dos hijas mientras también combatía el cáncer. No hace falta decir que me costó mucho criar a dos hijas jóvenes y sobrevivir en un país extranjero. Amigos locales peruanos y amigos afroperuanos nos ayudaron a alimentarme a mí y a mi familia a través de su música peruana. Fue mi confirmación; El mundo de la música y el baile afroperuano había sido mi vida. He estado con estas personas musicales conmovedoras y he estado interactuando con ellos como verdaderos familiares.Mi pasiónMi pasión se extendió y en 2015, una mujer peruana presentada por un músico me ofreció un puesto como directora musical. Emocionantemente, me convertí en socia de la empresa. Yo apasionadamente, en nombre del arte y de difundir el arte peruano al mundo, comencé a producir grupos y seleccioné una fusión de música peruana tradicional y contemporánea. Sin embargo, la mujer se asoció con un famoso director de televisión francés y tomó el precioso dinero que me habían financiado muchas personas sinceras y vulnerables. Todavía no quiero rendirme. La próxima generaciónQuiero dar a conocer esta cultura no solo en Perú, sino también en todo el mundo. Veo un gran poder en el poder y el valor de esta tradición cultural y espero que otros puedan compartir esa visión. Gracias por financiar a Kota-Kunde, y por creer en mí y en mis compañeros músicos afroperuanos y en alimentar un sueño para revivir culturas latentes pero vivas y conmovedoras para la próxima generación. AgradecimientoPor último, pero no menos importante, menciono a Yuko N. Taylor, una compañero del colegio que cooperó con este proyecto que ha visto la fusión de la cultura africana y la cultura moderna en la parte sur de América del Norte a través de la vista de una artista y la vista de una productora.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<strong>Renovating and expanding the store.</strong> Hamzeh needs to revitalize the storefront and renovate the interior, in addition to renewing the licensing and paying outstanding rent. He can double the area inside by expanding into the unit next door, which will make the space suitable for bigger gatherings and cultural events. The place also needs plaster and paint on the walls, a bathroom, and new shelves. Hamzeh plans to make the shelves movable so he can display books outside, move the shelves whenever he hosts an event in the store, and easily take the books on the road for his book fairs. </li></ul><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489118266/yvfafxogmawtmz6ojpuw.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">(Illustration for the exterior shelves by <a href=""http://archinect.com/jcoescharff"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jonah Coe-Scharff</a>.)</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Establishing a literary and cultural salon. </strong>For decades, al-Maa Bookstore has been a place of gathering for all lovers of books—rich and poor, foreign and local. Once the store has received its much-needed renovations, Hamzeh will be able to resume hosting evenings of discussion, literature, and music. The bookstore will once again be a sanctuary of peace and mingling of cultures on the busy, loud streets of downtown Amman.  </li>
<li>
<strong>Books in the community. </strong>Al-Maa Bookstore can create jobs and bring books to the wider community at the same time. Hamzeh plans to hire low-income residents of Amman who are having trouble seeking jobs to bring books across the city by bicycle or donkey, with a particular emphasis on children's books. </li>
</ul><h3><u><i>Medium-term goals (within the first 12 months)</i></u></h3><ul><li>
<strong>Book fairs in schools.</strong> In recent years, Al-Maa Bookstore has already run seven successful book fairs in different cities and universities across Jordan, including in the local schools for boys and girls run by UNRWA (the agency for Palestinian refugees in Jordan). Hamzeh intends to expand this program to bring the book fair to many more primary and secondary schools in underprivileged areas, with an emphasis on education for girls.</li></ul><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489016030/zzra5uai257xvoekbosl.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">(Hamzeh's book fair at the German Jordanian University in May 2016.)</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Book fairs in prisons.</strong> Hamzeh also intends to launch book fairs in prisons, believing that inmates should have the right to borrow and exchange books like anybody else. Through this program, Hamzeh will also invite and teach inmates to write about their experiences, and he plans to publish an anthology of their original work. </li>
<li>
<strong>Book fairs in refugee camps.</strong> Hamzeh has a deep concern for the welfare of the refugees who have flowed into Jordan—whether Palestinian, Iraqi, or Syrian—and has employed them in al-Maa Bookstore when business is good. He plans to work with organizations supporting refugees, in order to transfer his book fair model to refugee camps. </li>
</ul><h3><i><u>Long-term Goals</u></i></h3><ul>
<li>
<strong>Radio show. </strong>Hamzeh's idea is to interview both readers and writers, anybody with a gift for poetry, and especially elders from different tribes and rural areas. He sees recording and broadcasting these interviews as a powerful way to preserve folk traditions and dialects of Jordan—and also to make the culture of reading accessible to people who are blind through audio recordings. </li>
<li>
<strong>A museum for rare Arabic books.</strong> Hamzeh, together with his brothers, is the custodian of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Jahith's_Treasury"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">al-Jahith's Treasury</a>, an archive that was founded by his father Mamduh, and rapidly became one of the great private collections of rare books and manuscripts in the region. The treasures of the collection are not for sale, but Hamzeh wants to make them accessible to the public by transforming the inside of the bookstore into a museum for rare Arabic books. It will also be a laboratory where he can teach young people the art of restoring and digitizing old books.</li>

ImpactAt a time in history when many good people feel powerless—especially in the US and in the Middle East—this campaign is one way for you to make a concrete difference. All money raised will go toward promoting the culture of reading in the Middle East, spreading peace through books, and preserving a unique cultural inheritance for the youth of today and for future generations. Specifically, these are the projects you will be supporting: Short-term goals (within the first 6 months)
Renovating and expanding the store. Hamzeh needs to revitalize the storefront and renovate the interior, in addition to renewing the licensing and paying outstanding rent. He can double the area inside by expanding into the unit next door, which will make the space suitable for bigger gatherings and cultural events. The place also needs plaster and paint on the walls, a bathroom, and new shelves. Hamzeh plans to make the shelves movable so he can display books outside, move the shelves whenever he hosts an event in the store, and easily take the books on the road for his book fairs. (Illustration for the exterior shelves by Jonah Coe-Scharff.)

Establishing a literary and cultural salon. For decades, al-Maa Bookstore has been a place of gathering for all lovers of books—rich and poor, foreign and local. Once the store has received its much-needed renovations, Hamzeh will be able to resume hosting evenings of discussion, literature, and music. The bookstore will once again be a sanctuary of peace and mingling of cultures on the busy, loud streets of downtown Amman.  

Books in the community. Al-Maa Bookstore can create jobs and bring books to the wider community at the same time. Hamzeh plans to hire low-income residents of Amman who are having trouble seeking jobs to bring books across the city by bicycle or donkey, with a particular emphasis on children's books. 
Medium-term goals (within the first 12 months)
Book fairs in schools. In recent years, Al-Maa Bookstore has already run seven successful book fairs in different cities and universities across Jordan, including in the local schools for boys and girls run by UNRWA (the agency for Palestinian refugees in Jordan). Hamzeh intends to expand this program to bring the book fair to many more primary and secondary schools in underprivileged areas, with an emphasis on education for girls.(Hamzeh's book fair at the German Jordanian University in May 2016.)

Book fairs in prisons. Hamzeh also intends to launch book fairs in prisons, believing that inmates should have the right to borrow and exchange books like anybody else. Through this program, Hamzeh will also invite and teach inmates to write about their experiences, and he plans to publish an anthology of their original work. 

Book fairs in refugee camps. Hamzeh has a deep concern for the welfare of the refugees who have flowed into Jordan—whether Palestinian, Iraqi, or Syrian—and has employed them in al-Maa Bookstore when business is good. He plans to work with organizations supporting refugees, in order to transfer his book fair model to refugee camps. 
Long-term Goals

Radio show. Hamzeh's idea is to interview both readers and writers, anybody with a gift for poetry, and especially elders from different tribes and rural areas. He sees recording and broadcasting these interviews as a powerful way to preserve folk traditions and dialects of Jordan—and also to make the culture of reading accessible to people who are blind through audio recordings. 

A museum for rare Arabic books. Hamzeh, together with his brothers, is the custodian of al-Jahith's Treasury, an archive that was founded by his father Mamduh, and rapidly became one of the great private collections of rare books and manuscripts in the region. The treasures of the collection are not for sale, but Hamzeh wants to make them accessible to the public by transforming the inside of the bookstore into a museum for rare Arabic books. It will also be a laboratory where he can teach young people the art of restoring and digitizing old books.

Matching donations up to a certain value;
Donating a perk;
Connecting us to an NGO;
Connecting us to a foundation, or recommending a grant to apply for;
Design work for the campaign and for al-Maa in general;
Pro bono business consulting for al-Maa to rework its business plan;
Writing a press release, or advertising this campaign any other way;
The ways to help are limitless! All suggestions are welcome. 
ReliabilityAlongside Hamzeh's passion and vision, he brings 17 years of experience in the book trade. He has been running al-Maa Bookstore in its current location since 2000.Hamzeh already laid the groundwork for most of these projects prior to his major health and economic setback last summer. He has conducted 7 book fairs and workshops in recent years, both in Amman and in the surrounding towns. Through these initiatives he closely cooperated with the local municipalities and ministries, whose support and funding will make these programs sustainable going forward.Although the economic climate in Jordan remains challenging, Hamzeh's health has improved, and with your support he will be able to build on these initiatives and guarantee that al-Maa's legacy will continue for future generations. Hussein Alazaat, a native of Jordan and a graduate of the London Art College, brings nearly a decade of experience in the field of design in Amman. Most significantly, he cofounded the Wajha Project in 2012, a charitable social initiative which helps small business owners revitalize their branding. With Hussein's years of experience working with traditional shop owners such as Hamzeh, he is contributing the practical skills to help Hamzeh turn his vision into a reality. LinksWikipedia on al-Jahith's TreasuryHussein Alazaat on what Hamzeh's bookstore means to himA Jordan Bookseller’s 24-Hour ‘Emergency Room for the Mind’",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>In our project there are more than 50 people rehearsing and finally on stage (many of them for the first time!) singing, dancing, balancing and interacting with the audience. Giant puppets, stiltwalking heroes, trapeeze, silks and monocycles.  Performers range from 4-60 years of age and come from many different countries-cultures. Everyone has their own story and we will sing together the oldest written story on earth, about Gilgamesh and how he uses his great power to conquer nature and chase immortality through material wealth. We end by showing that the same story has been playing for at least 5000 years and that we need to stop giving our lives to build towers for the rich and powerful. Opera Babel, our group of players speak many different languages, but the theme of the show is to understand each other and create a world based on balance and harmony.</p>

<p>My name is Ben Berman, the US-based fundraising coordinator for Steve's project! For many  years now Steve Appiah has been spreading the gift of kente weaving from his native Ghana in the community of Johannesburg, South Africa. He has taught unemployed adults and at-risk youth to realize their creative potentials and support themselves. Now, Steve is trying to expand his reach--he is starting an ambitious revamping of the building where his studio is. He envisions the building to become a center where he and other local artists can teach and sell their crafts to others in the community. He is already doing renovations himself, but he needs enough funds for more tools and supplies, as well as for permits and a license to operate some of the rooms as a new guesthouse.<br/><br/>How did a random American end up raising money for a Ghanaian weaver? I was blessed to first meet Steve in a time of need when I first traveled to South Africa. I was mugged on my second day in Joburg, my wallet and phone stolen--unfortunately a not uncommon experience for first-time visitors to some South African cities, with the country's stark inequality and crime. Thankfully I was unharmed, and a few locals helped me safely get around to buy a new phone and contact the hostel I was staying at. Steve happened to be at the phone store and overheard me telling someone what had happened, and he introduced himself, showing me his business card.<br/><br/>For the next couple days Steve took me around the city, introducing me to his family and friends, and showing me some of the city's diverse, resilient communities. I was completely safe with him being a local. He took time out of his busy life--working his weaving, repairing shoes, and helping his kids on their homework--to be a private guide for me, a stranger. Steve helped me find a bus to my next destination, and continued to check in with me over the next two months as I went around the country. When I came back to Joburg before flying home, he insisted on hosting me in his weaving studio for a few days.</p>
<p>So to give back to how Steve and other people around Joburg welcomed me, I'm now trying to get support for Steve to take his art and teaching work with the community to another level. Now that South Africa has moved out of its months-long period of COVID lockdowns, people are out and about again. Steve is currently doing a lot of painting, wire and pipe repair, landscaping, and other cleaning himself day in an day out, but he needs money for more supplies and early rent as he prepares, in this crucial stage, to open his center in January. Even small contributions are extremely helpful, as 1 US dollar converts to 17 South African rands and can go far when added up. This is not just another corporate charity fund of throwing money at African governments to save statistics from famine and disease; this is a way to contribute meaningfully to a project run by locals to empower other locals, something that will make a long-term impact in people's lives.<br/><br/>Here is an article about Steve's work from a few years ago:<br/><br/><a href=""https://northcliffmelvilletimes.co.za/244528/melville-gets-some-kente-flare/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://northcliffmelvilletimes.co.za/244528/me...</a></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We believe that the development of a global consciousness of humanity is only possible<br/>if there are international organizations that set the enforcing of such consciousness as their<br/>goal. The VAC in Belgrade is our first step on a long road that leads to a global network of<br/>similar hubs aiming to be a powerhouse of socially sensitive artistic and scientific work.<br/>We are a completely independent non-profit organization, not a part of any existing<br/>institution. Although we are not opposed to collaboration with governmental institutions, we<br/>do not want our infrastructure to depend on anybody else but the community we are creating.<br/>We want our unique artistic and scientific approach to stay free and individual, non-biased by<br/>existing power structures and political tendencies.</p>
<p>We have successfully organized the School of Visual Anthropology workshop five years<br/>consecutively; more than 100 people participated with the help of 30 lecturers and mentors.<br/>This time is a bit different though: we are going international! What's more we would like not only our school to be open for applicants from all around the world, but for the whole initiative to be global!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We all know film-making is an expensive business. Shooting documentaries makes it even harder due to their non-commercial nature. What we are aiming for is not to collect funds for a film project and disappear. On the contrary: the workshop we are hosting is just the first step. We firmly believe that in the age of the internet it is possible to create an independent initiative, that doesn't depend on state subventions. Our team is very young and ambitious so your participation means the world to us: if we can make the first step our project may grow in to something  truly significant on the long run! </p>
<p>What we need first and foremost is... you! The call for taking part in School of Visual Anthropology 2018 is open: you can join us in Belgrade between the 1st and the 10th of July and take part in our workshop. Broaden your perspectives with our lecturers, create your short documentary film with the help of our professional mentors and help us lay the foundations of an international hub of social sciences and film. If you can't join us this time you might still want to help us collect the necessary financial means to support the workshop and the work of Visual Anthropology Center. </p>
<p>You can help us create a strong community of filmmakers and social scientists with a the naive yet ever so crucial goal of making the world a better place. The funds collected in this campaign will finance the 10 days workshop that is the first event hosted by VAC. </p>
<p>There will be internationally renowned lecturers and workshop leaders from 8 different countries, 30 participants divided in 5 filming crews. Our goal is to demonstrate that if the costs are shared progressively by the participants and generous donors it is possible to host such an event without commercial sponsoring. The compensations of all lecturers, all participants living costs and the production costs of the short films that will be shot during the workshop will all be included in the workshops price. According to our calculations the average cost of one participant is approximately 600 euros. On the Balkans and in Eastern Europe barely any participant could afford to pay such a price, which is why we made the pricing progressive so the price range is between 100 and 1000 euros - it may be hard to believe but for an average Belgrader 100 euros is more or less equivalent of 1000 bucks for a New Yorker... </p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal we will need to decrease the dimensions of the workshop proportionately, thus the funds will finance the aforementioned goals nonetheless.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The goal of the project is to introduce visual anthropology to established professionals<br/>in film making and/or social sciences who would like to broaden their perspectives as well as<br/>to scholars who are new to this field(s).<br/>We provide theoretical and practical workshops, involving filming and post-production<br/>of short anthropological films. The call is open for applicants with or without experience - what<br/>matters is enthusiasm towards promotion of social awareness through visual anthropology.<br/>Our aim is to encourage critical thinking, fostering tolerance for the Other, while<br/>broadening the knowledge of participants as film-makers and social scientists.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The only risk we see is that the interest is going to be greater amongst a financially less prepared target group. In this case we would have difficulties in covering the costs of the workshop. </p>
<p>We have organized the School of Visual Anthropology successfully 5 times and always managed to overcome the financial difficulties, but this time the project is bigger. We believe that if the interest is as high as we expect than we should have no problem now that the call is open for internationals as well. </p>
<p>We will see the success of our first international workshop as a green light for Visual Anthropology Center as an world wide organisation.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Share, share, share! Call your friends who might be interested and spread the word. </p>
<p>One more way you can help is if you contribute to our cause with your knowledge. We'd be happy to publish your work on our pages and more than happy if you'd like to contribute to the creation of the VAC with your knowledge or a word of advice!</p>

<h3>The Zombie Research Society</h3>
<p>The Zombie Research Society was created in 2007 by our founder, author, and zombie expert Matt Mogk. He dedicated our organization to the science, survival, and culture of the living dead. Our official Advisory Board, which consists of authors, academics, and scholars quickly became the ultimate authority on the undead for a number of official organizations and state governments including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Zombie Research Society is on the bleeding-edge of zombie research.</li>
<li>Our members provide support for our research, articles, and scientific conferences.</li>
<li>Without the support of our members we are unable to continue our vital research.</li>
</ul>
<p>We created Zombie Awareness Month; currently recognized by a number of local and state governments, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We are dedicated to the promotion of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) for children, students, and researchers by emphasizing the fun and imagination inherit in studying the living dead. We also encourage the application of epidemiology, statistical analysis, and neuroscience in order to share the benefits of our zombie research with the scientific world.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602541296/anqozjjd9hsbbz0nyamc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Join the Zombie Research Society!</h3>
<p>Our research is only considered ""fun"" and ""theoretical"" until it's too late! So, we need your support to continue. We need your support to encourage the next generation of students, researchers, and scientists. We need your support to fund our website, our Advisory Board, our publications, our social media, and perhaps most importantly... our research:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Zombie Research Society is a volunteer organization.</li>
<li>We rely entirely on our members for funding, for outreach, and for web hosting fees.</li>
<li>By joining the Zombie Research Society, you will help us pay our bills. We will be able to continue hosting the official website, additional research, and our social media accounts.</li>
<li>By joining the Zombie Research Society, you can help us attend scientific conferences, conventions &amp; encourage students to dedicate their studies to STEM and the living dead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to COVID-19 we're missing out on all of the live events, conventions, and conferences that help us keep going financially. So, if you join the Zombie Research Society during this official Membership Drive, you'll be one of the select few that we accept into our ranks sight-unseen. It's a rare privilege, and we're happy to offer this opportunity to our fans across the world!</p>

<h3>We are Deadly Serious. How about You?</h3>
<p>We do not believe that zombies exist... at least not yet. However, our studies and research are mostly theoretical. Many of our official Advisory Board members have used the living dead to expand the current study &amp; scientific knowledge of epidemiology, statistical analysis, and neuroscience. And they apply these scenarios to engage and encourage their students:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students love the living dead. Zombies are exciting and promote learning.</li>
<li>We have authored a number of books from analytical tomes like ""Do Zombies Dream of Undead Sheep"" to children's books including the ""Zombie Zone"" series from Bearport Publishing or ""Nerd A to Z"" from National Geographic Children's Books.</li>
<li>Our members support this outreach with their donations. Perhaps we've even inspired your own child to study science, technology, engineering, or mathematics!</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, we are serious; but we also have a lot of fun! During our appearances on AMC's ""Talking Dead"" with Chris Hardwick, we interacted with thousands of fans who had no idea that our research was real, legitimate, and innovative.

<p>The Zombie Research Society is a volunteer organization. None of our authors, contributors, researchers, or Advisory Board members are paid - period.

We simply need your support to pay for web hosting, research, conference attendance, and travel. The Zombie Research Society was never intended to be strictly an online resource. We want to send our representatives to schools, colleges, and conferences to encourage this field of research:</p>

<li>Many of the giveaways and contests that you've seen are completely out-of-pocket; paid for by us personally, simply because we believe in this organization.</li>

</ul>
<p>Let us repeat that the Zombie Research Society is a volunteer organization. If you've enjoyed our research, please consider joining our organization. Our authors, researchers, and Advisory Board Members are students, scientists, and fans - just like you! And we simply couldn't keep going without your support.

The Zombie Research Society was created in 2007 by our founder, author, and zombie expert Matt Mogk. He dedicated our organization to the science, survival, and culture of the living dead. Our official Advisory Board, which consists of authors, academics, and scholars quickly became the ultimate authority on the undead for a number of official organizations and state governments including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:

The Zombie Research Society is on the bleeding-edge of zombie research.
Our members provide support for our research, articles, and scientific conferences.
Without the support of our members we are unable to continue our vital research.

We created Zombie Awareness Month; currently recognized by a number of local and state governments, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We are dedicated to the promotion of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) for children, students, and researchers by emphasizing the fun and imagination inherit in studying the living dead. We also encourage the application of epidemiology, statistical analysis, and neuroscience in order to share the benefits of our zombie research with the scientific world.

 

Join the Zombie Research Society!
Our research is only considered ""fun"" and ""theoretical"" until it's too late! So, we need your support to continue. We need your support to encourage the next generation of students, researchers, and scientists. We need your support to fund our website, our Advisory Board, our publications, our social media, and perhaps most importantly... our research:

The Zombie Research Society is a volunteer organization.
We rely entirely on our members for funding, for outreach, and for web hosting fees.
By joining the Zombie Research Society, you will help us pay our bills. We will be able to continue hosting the official website, additional research, and our social media accounts.
By joining the Zombie Research Society, you can help us attend scientific conferences, conventions & encourage students to dedicate their studies to STEM and the living dead.

Due to COVID-19 we're missing out on all of the live events, conventions, and conferences that help us keep going financially. So, if you join the Zombie Research Society during this official Membership Drive, you'll be one of the select few that we accept into our ranks sight-unseen. It's a rare privilege, and we're happy to offer this opportunity to our fans across the world!




 
We are Deadly Serious. How about You?
We do not believe that zombies exist... at least not yet. However, our studies and research are mostly theoretical. Many of our official Advisory Board members have used the living dead to expand the current study & scientific knowledge of epidemiology, statistical analysis, and neuroscience. And they apply these scenarios to engage and encourage their students:

Students love the living dead. Zombies are exciting and promote learning.
We have authored a number of books from analytical tomes like ""Do Zombies Dream of Undead Sheep"" to children's books including the ""Zombie Zone"" series from Bearport Publishing or ""Nerd A to Z"" from National Geographic Children's Books.
Our members support this outreach with their donations. Perhaps we've even inspired your own child to study science, technology, engineering, or mathematics!

Yes, we are serious; but we also have a lot of fun! During our appearances on AMC's ""Talking Dead"" with Chris Hardwick, we interacted with thousands of fans who had no idea that our research was real, legitimate, and innovative. Our official Advisory Board quickly changed their minds, and our publications are now cited and referenced in textbooks around the world.

<p>2019 kerek évfordulók palettájával igazán érdekes témákat vet fel. 100 év, vagyis <strong>egy teljes évszázad telt el az első homoszexuális témájú némafilm megjelenése óta</strong>: 1919-ben a Más, mint a többiek két zenész történetén keresztül döntött tabukat a mozivásznon. <strong>50 éve már az utcán zajlottak a legfontosabb változások</strong>: az LMBT vendégkör a manhattani Stonewall bárban fordult szembe a megalázó rendőri intézkedésekkel, és tette le az LMBT-mozgalom alapjait. <strong>30 éve pedig olvadtak a “hideg diktatúrák”, a rendszerváltás alapjaiban változtatta meg az LMBT-közösség és -szervezetek politikai környezetét.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Több fontos személyhez</strong> köthetően is kiemelt év 2019: egyebek mellett Walt Whitman és Birtalan Balázs költők születésének, Habsburg-Lotaringiai Lajos Viktor főherceg és Galgóczi Erzsébet író halálának évfordulójára is emlékezünk.</p>
<p>A programsorozatot a Háttér Társaság és a Labrisz Leszbikus Egyesület közösen koordinálja, évek óta célként kitűzve a társadalom LMBT-ügyekkel kapcsolatos ismereteinek bővítését, a sztereotípiák, előítéletek csökkentését.</p>
<p>Idén is számtalan filmvetítéssel, előadással, kerekasztallal és egyéb programmal készülünk. Ahhoz azonban, hogy valóban színes programfüzetet tudjunk összeállítani és méltóképp nyúljunk az évfordulós eseményekhez, <strong>adományokra is szükségünk van</strong>.</p>

<p>With a plethora of round anniversaries, our year 2019 raises extremely interesting topics. <strong>100 years, a whole century has passed since the release of the first LGBT-themed film</strong>: in 1919, “Different from the Others” started to break taboos on the cinema canvas, through the history of two musicians. <strong>50 years ago, the most important changes were already happening in the streets: </strong>in Manhattan, LMBT guests of the Stonewall Inn turned against the humiliating police raids and laid down the foundations of the LGBT movement. Then <strong>30 years ago, “cold dictatorships” began to melt</strong>, the regime change profoundly altered the political environment of the LGBT community and organizations.</p>
<p>2019 is a unique year from the aspect of <strong>personal anniversaries</strong> as well: we commemorate the birth of two poets, Walt Whitman and Balázs Birtalan, just as the death of Archduke Ludwig Viktor of Austria and the Hungarian writer, Erzsébet Galgóczi.</p>
<p>Coordinated together by Labrisz Lesbian Association and Háttér Society, our event has the aim of expanding the knowledge of society about LGBT-related issues and the reduction of stereotypes, prejudices.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Back in 2015, I realized none of my regular regional Burning Man festivals provided day bars, places for burners like me to hang out while the late-night ravers sleep it off. I decided to create a Bloody Mary Bar, playing off my burn name, Slaughter, and intended to create a gore-fest horror movie type theme camp.</p>
<p>Then in 2016, I got my period at 3 burns in a row, including Burning Man itself. And instead we launched the Bloody Bar, where we serve Bloody Marys and celebrate the Bloody Time of the Month. Over the last two years our little camp has poured hundreds of the best Bloody Marys on the Razorgrass and provided a place to acknowledge that every single one of us is alive because Mom missed her period that one time.</p>
<p>And that's the reason we exist - to normalize the reality that any given time, 1 in 4 of us is bleeding. Our Bar is gender inclusive - we talk about The Flow, not ""being a woman."" Serving Bloody Marys is the reason participants come by -- learning about our bodies, venting about periods and playing Menstrual Bingo is why people stay.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Now?</h3>
<p>After attending 9 different burns over the last 3 years, our infrastructure is dying. The Bar itself has swollen with moisture and a piece has broken off:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579574396/jyfqgncbeoqwgiuk9edf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Our main easy-up that shelters the Bar busted a leg.</p>
<p>Our Camp has grown from 3 regular members to 23 regular members, so some of our residential components like the Camp Kitchen need some help.</p>
<p>Because of what De-commodification and Communal Effort means to us, we're pooling our resources as a camp, rather than charging camp dues at each event. Our regular ""dues"" are a handle of vodka, cans of plain tomato juice, and a pillow for the cuddle pit.</p>
<p>We're also inviting our beloved fans and patrons to assist with our infrastructure replacement needs, expansion, and of course, some fun things like plushies and swag!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Our Future</h3>
<p>We have big dreams for expansion: attending larger Regionals like Lakes of Fire, To the Moon, and Transformus; adding workshops like the Virgin Mary Hour, an educational offering for young burners to learn about puberty and periods, providing a glorious public cuddle space with a subfloor to keep us out of the mud, and taking the Bloody Bar to Burning Man in 2023.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our fundraising goal is $2,500 to enable us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replace the swollen, rotting, beat up Bar with a hardwood base!</li>
<li>Replace the hand-lettered mildewing sign with a larger, lit one!</li>
<li>Fund the new canvas tent that will house the Bar!</li>
<li>Replace the fading tarps on our monkey huts!</li>
<li>Add a subfloor to our larger (8'x8') cuddle space!</li>
<li>Add more playatech furniture for our Bar space, the Kitchen and the Lounge</li>
<li>Add important safety details, like rubber mats for the kitchen and fire safety!</li>
<li>Commission two local artists to design art for the new Bar and an icon for our swag</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Did you catch that last bullet point? Don't you want some amazing swag with our new icon all over it? Check out the perks: enamel pins, patches, hoodies! Please allow us to know who to shower with our gratitude!</p>
<p>All contributions will be used, whether we reach our goal or not. The Bloody Bunch will work together to decide what gets bought first (pretty sure we start with a new Bar).</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I remember telling a (non-burner) acquaintance about the Bloody Bar, and she responded, wow, my husband could never hang out at your Bar. He gets entirely weirded out if you even mention periods! And I bet all of us are familiar with the ""OMG you expect me to buy your tampons while I'm grocery shopping?"" comedy bits about period hygiene supplies.</p>
<p>This stigma, embarrassment, ignorance, and confusion fuels our mission. The Bar becomes a venue for real conversation about bodies, bleeding, gender, sex, consent, and everything else. Attending larger and larger events will enable us to reach more people and change these attitudes, educate our youth, and be playful with this monthly curse.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, and that's 100% okay! Please help get the word out and make some noise about Slaughter's Bloody Bar and our fundraiser!

The year gave us a group of new female icons including Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Jameela Jamil, and all of the incredible women behind Time's Up. The country mobilized and elected a record 117 women across the United States in the mid-term elections. California passed a landmark bill that made the state the first in the nation to require more women in boardrooms. Yes, we made progress last year, but there is still a lot of work to do and we need your help.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547346212/wgrfgmg13bafb5l2cfsr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>What is theBoardlist?</h3><p>theBoardlist is a global talent platform that curates, develops and connects exceptional women with board opportunities. It all started in May 2015 when our founder—Sukhinder Singh Cassidy—published an open letter on recode.com, titled <a href=""https://www.recode.net/2015/5/13/11562596/tech-women-choose-possibility"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Tech Women Choose Possibility,”</a> challenging the tech community to increase the rate of progress for women in the industry by leveraging its wealth of existing female talent. Sukhinder penned the letter, which was co-signed by 59 female technology entrepreneurs and investors, drawing from her own experiences as a tech entrepreneur coupled with research she conducted with 230 female founders and CEOs of technology companies.</p><p>Her eye-opening research, along with the tech community's overwhelmingly positive response to it, signaled an opportunity to build a better way for CEOs and corporate boards to find great female board candidates. And, theBoardlist was born. </p><h3>theProblem?</h3><p>While women make up roughly 50% of the global population, they represent a shockingly small percentage of company board seats—women hold only 17% of Russell 3000 company board seats. Despite <a href=""https://theboardlist.com/resources"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">substantial evidence</a> that diverse boards lead to better business outcomes, boardrooms overwhelmingly lack diversity. There’s an increasing demand for diverse board talent, but board recruiting still relies on stale, limited referral networks. </p><h3>theSolution?</h3><p>theBoardlist goes beyond the networks that dominate boards today and connects a rising tide of powerful, qualified female talent with companies looking to build boards that more accurately reflect the customers they serve.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547350144/cydqt9hn4iedzlsg7dlb.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We know $200,000 is an ambitious goal, but it will help us make great strides in our work toward gender parity in the boardroom. <u><strong>Here's how you can help</strong></u>:</p><ol>

<li>To scale our platform to meet the increased demands from candidates and companies who lack gender parity.</li>
<li>To extend our reach across industries and double the number of companies that use our platform to find board candidates.</li>
<li>To scale our team to meet increased demand. </li>
</ul><h3>Where your money goes</h3><p>We began with a focus on privately funded technology companies in California, roughly 75% of which have absolutely no women serving on their boards. The money we raise with your help will allow us to expand our mission to effect change across the gamut of industries and geographies. More specifically, your donation to the <strong>#BoardForward Campaign </strong>enables us to:</p><ul>
<li>Expand our pipeline and reach to include women leaders in every industry with the talent, track record, and smarts to be stellar board members.</li>

<p><strong>We thank you for anything you can do to help. Together, we can demonstrate our passion for gender equality and move the #BoardForward.</strong></p>
</div></div>","2018  was a banner year for gender issues. The year gave us a group of new female icons including Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Jameela Jamil, and all of the incredible women behind Time's Up. The country mobilized and elected a record 117 women across the United States in the mid-term elections. California passed a landmark bill that made the state the first in the nation to require more women in boardrooms. Yes, we made progress last year, but there is still a lot of work to do and we need your help.What is theBoardlist?theBoardlist is a global talent platform that curates, develops and connects exceptional women with board opportunities. It all started in May 2015 when our founder—Sukhinder Singh Cassidy—published an open letter on recode.com, titled “Tech Women Choose Possibility,” challenging the tech community to increase the rate of progress for women in the industry by leveraging its wealth of existing female talent. Sukhinder penned the letter, which was co-signed by 59 female technology entrepreneurs and investors, drawing from her own experiences as a tech entrepreneur coupled with research she conducted with 230 female founders and CEOs of technology companies.Her eye-opening research, along with the tech community's overwhelmingly positive response to it, signaled an opportunity to build a better way for CEOs and corporate boards to find great female board candidates. And, theBoardlist was born. theProblem?While women make up roughly 50% of the global population, they represent a shockingly small percentage of company board seats—women hold only 17% of Russell 3000 company board seats. Despite substantial evidence that diverse boards lead to better business outcomes, boardrooms overwhelmingly lack diversity. There’s an increasing demand for diverse board talent, but board recruiting still relies on stale, limited referral networks. theSolution?theBoardlist goes beyond the networks that dominate boards today and connects a rising tide of powerful, qualified female talent with companies looking to build boards that more accurately reflect the customers they serve.We know $200,000 is an ambitious goal, but it will help us make great strides in our work toward gender parity in the boardroom. Here's how you can help:

Donate Now: Every dollar we raise allows us to identify additional exceptional candidates, arm them with the tools they need for board service, and place them on a board that currently lacks diversity. 

Tell Your Friends: Please share the #BoardForward Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, email—whatever you can do to help us get the word out! Here are some sample posts so you can copy/paste to make it easy:
I just backed @theboardlist’s #BoardForward campaign to continue working toward gender parity in the boardroom. RT and visit bit.ly/BoardForward2019 to join me and contribute!
RT if you think it’s time to put women where they belong: THE BOARDROOM. @theboardlist is on a quest for gender parity—help them move the #BoardForward. DONATE ➡ bit.ly/BoardForward2019.

Don’t think corporate America is lacking gender equality? Don’t click here: bit.ly/BoardForward2019 #BoardForward


Why we're raising moneyFor three important reasons:
To scale our platform to meet the increased demands from candidates and companies who lack gender parity.
To extend our reach across industries and double the number of companies that use our platform to find board candidates.
To scale our team to meet increased demand. 
Where your money goesWe began with a focus on privately funded technology companies in California, roughly 75% of which have absolutely no women serving on their boards. The money we raise with your help will allow us to expand our mission to effect change across the gamut of industries and geographies. More specifically, your donation to the #BoardForward Campaign enables us to:
Expand our pipeline and reach to include women leaders in every industry with the talent, track record, and smarts to be stellar board members.
Create additional resources, educational tools, and coaching events to invest in the pipeline of future female leaders.
Hire the team members we need to meet our goals.
Engage with more companies—ranging from early-stage startups to large public companies—to bring greater diversity to their boards
Enhance our technology to better match companies with candidates outside their first order network.
Since launching in 2016, theBoardlist has built a community of thousands of board-ready female CEOs and C-Suite executives and facilitated 500+ board searches. We have worked with companies whose leaders are committed to diversity and inclusion—including Shutterfly, Fossil, and Mindbody— to place exceptional women on their boards.  We’re proud of the impact we’ve made since launching theBoardlist and we're ready to take the next step to move the #BoardForward. Just a few of the companies that have searched for candidates on theBoardlist:Mentorship is integral to advancing women in corporate America and moving the #BoardForward. We are excited to offer mentorship opportunity perks, thanks to the generosity of some incredible friends of theBoardlist who donated their time to our campaign.Mentorship from the Media Legend, Katie Couric:Our first mentorship opportunity perk is live right now!

<p><strong>1 DAY</strong> On Wednesday, <strong>June 21st</strong>, from dawn through dusk, NYC will come together to ring in the first day of summer on the longest day of the year with a celebration of music like no other…</p>
<p><strong>400+ VENUES</strong> A “music holiday” that will bring our shared, outdoor spaces to vibrant life with free performances in public plazas, parks and community gardens; in front of restaurants, bars, shops and businesses; and in partnerships with cultural institutions across all five boroughs…</p>
<p><strong>1,000+ CONCERTS </strong>A festival featuring performances representing every conceivable genre and style of music...</p>
<p><strong>5,000+ PERFORMERS </strong>And a music holiday starring the amazing talents and passions of local New Yorkers of all ages, backgrounds and skill levels.</p>
<p>The Make Music New York team was putting the finishing touches on the <strong>eleventh consecutive</strong> edition of our annual music holiday when we got word that we will not be receiving an expected funding grant of $20,000. Since receiving this news two weeks ago, we have exhausted every resource to cut this 20K gap in half and now are just $10,000 shy of our goal.</p>
<p>Now, for the first time in our eleven-year history, we are appealing directly to our artists, fans and all NYC music lovers to come together, step up, and contribute to our remaining $10,000 need. Because although the festival is free to the public, it is not free to produce<strong>.</strong> </p>
<p>This is not a typical appeal for support to help Make Music New York launch a special project or take on a new initiative. <strong>We have very real and immediate expenses of $10,000 to cover before the end of the month, </strong>specifically:</p>
<p><strong>We need to secure an additional 145 sound permits at $45 each, for a total cost of $6,525.</strong><br/>When a Make Music New Yorker musician wants to present an amplified concert, we must secure a sound permit from the City of New York to make their wish come true. We have already procured half of the permits required for June 21<sup>st</sup>, but still need an additional 145 permits for outdoor locations in all five boroughs. Help us keep the festival plugged in!</p>

</div></div>","1 DAY On Wednesday, June 21st, from dawn through dusk, NYC will come together to ring in the first day of summer on the longest day of the year with a celebration of music like no other…
400+ VENUES A “music holiday” that will bring our shared, outdoor spaces to vibrant life with free performances in public plazas, parks and community gardens; in front of restaurants, bars, shops and businesses; and in partnerships with cultural institutions across all five boroughs…
1,000+ CONCERTS A festival featuring performances representing every conceivable genre and style of music...
5,000+ PERFORMERS And a music holiday starring the amazing talents and passions of local New Yorkers of all ages, backgrounds and skill levels.
The Make Music New York team was putting the finishing touches on the eleventh consecutive edition of our annual music holiday when we got word that we will not be receiving an expected funding grant of $20,000. Since receiving this news two weeks ago, we have exhausted every resource to cut this 20K gap in half and now are just $10,000 shy of our goal.
Now, for the first time in our eleven-year history, we are appealing directly to our artists, fans and all NYC music lovers to come together, step up, and contribute to our remaining $10,000 need. Because although the festival is free to the public, it is not free to produce. 
This is not a typical appeal for support to help Make Music New York launch a special project or take on a new initiative. We have very real and immediate expenses of $10,000 to cover before the end of the month, specifically:
We need to secure an additional 145 sound permits at $45 each, for a total cost of $6,525.When a Make Music New Yorker musician wants to present an amplified concert, we must secure a sound permit from the City of New York to make their wish come true. We have already procured half of the permits required for June 21st, but still need an additional 145 permits for outdoor locations in all five boroughs. Help us keep the festival plugged in!
We also need to raise $1,706 to maintain our general liability insurance coverage.We know that is about the most uncool sounding expense imaginable, and it is likely the last thing on the minds of our artists and fans.  That’s as it should be! But we cannot safely and legally present over 1,000 free, outdoor concerts without this required coverage in place.

<p>This year, as part of <strong>Hull City of Culture 2017,</strong> we're holding a special one-off free evening event called <strong>Our Street Our Stage.</strong></p>
<p>The event will celebrate the wonderfully diverse area of Newland by recreating moments from its forgotten heritage – such as its origins as green fields, its connection to Hull Pals, the Sailor Home’s Whitsun Carnivals and the old Monica Cinema.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you doing Our Street Our Stage?</strong><br/>The event will truly shine the spotlight on Newland and draw attention to its fantastic local community spirit. The event will take place on the street itself, and will bring the avenue to life. Not much is known about the heritage of Newland, and so through Our Street Our Stage, we hope to educate, inspire and entertain. As the audience move down the avenue, a new scene will take place.</p>
<p><strong>Why should I donate?</strong><br/>This is a completely free event, and we have had a huge level of support from local businesses and residents who believe in what we're doing. We are working with choreographer Jon Beney, musicians Dan Bye and Boff Whalley, local theatre company Broccolily, the phenomenal Hull Samba and Lo:Cus Dance to name a few - but we need your help to make this happen. Your pledges for <strong>Our Street Our Stage</strong> will go towards costumes for dancers and St Nicholas Primary School pupils, rehearsal costs, props and more. </p>
<p>We are passionate about breaking down the barriers some face when accessing art; this event will be completely free to attend (you don't even need to book a ticket), right on the doorstep of the local community and provide opportunity to be involved whatever your experience.</p>
<p><strong>What will my donation pay for?</strong><br/>We are fundraising £2000 towards Our Street Our Stage.</p>
<ul>
<li>£1000 of that will pay for costumes for dancers, street performers and 20 young cast members to recreate parts of the Whitsun Carnival and the Hull Pals.</li>
<li>£750 will pay for rehearsal costs so that the local community cast, choir and dancers will be able to rehearse in a large enough space.</li>
<li>£250 will pay for props such as 1960s vintage prams and wheelie bin’s to be upcycled into incredible portable speakers made by a local sound artist.</li>

The Seto Inland Sea, where Teshima is located, is one such beautiful place in Japan which retains unique scenic beauties. The entire region, including the sea and the coastal areas around it, is often collectively called “Setouchi.” The sea water is calm, like that of a lake, and the scenic beauty, consisting of the sea dotted with thousands of islands, makes it one of Japan’s most beautiful places. The unique cultures and traditions that are nurtured by the region’s nature and its history of trade serve as significant attractions; these aspects are still deeply rooted in people’s everyday lives today.</p><p align=""left""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499315434/hxenpdv71dnhfaurfpmp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p align=""left"">There are some 700 smaller islands in the Seto Inland Sea, only 160 of which are inhabited. Even the inhabited islands have suffered depopulation, as well as aging populations; as such, it is not uncommon to have islands where residents have an average age above 70. Teshima is no exception; it is a small island with around only 800 inhabitants, challenged with depopulation and an aging population. As the name “Teshima” (literally, “rich island”) indicates, the island is blessed with spring water. Local residents have supported themselves by growing rice, dairy farming, fishing and growing vegetables. Dairy farming has enabled island residents to be self-sufficient and produce abundant food.  The original landscape of Japan has been preserved, along with traditional styles of living that have been lost in more urban areas.</p><p align=""left""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499315476/nqkouk24j4wxqubvu1mj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p align=""left""><i><u>Behind the Story</u></i></p><p align=""left"">However, at the height of the rapid economic growth of Japan, when mass consumption became a virtue, a grave incident occurred; a huge amount of industrial waste was disposed illegally in Teshima. Old things were destroyed, new things were produced one after another, and the huge amount of waste caused from such consumption was illegally dumped on this otherwise beautiful, untouched island in Setouchi. The beautiful beach was filled with garbage from unauthorized dumping, which was buried in the sand or piled up in heaps and burnt, causing black smoke to rise here and there. The residents of Teshima continuously complained to the municipal authorities about the appalling, abnormal situation that had befallen the island, but the authorities did not recognize the problem for a long time.</p><p align=""left"">The people of Teshima, with a strong desire to protect their island, at last filed for arbitration at the Kagawa prefecture. After a long legal battle, the issue was finally settled and the cleaning of the island started, which was completed on March 29, 2017. It took as long as 14 years for all of the industrial waste that had been dumped on the island to be removed. (937,000 tons in total) This incident is now considered to be a turning point for the nation, highlighting the need to transition from a mass consumption and mass waste style of life to a more recycling-oriented society.</p><p align=""left""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499315629/vnq8ztuymxwjqpqyzy3u.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p align=""left"">As the new era was ushered in, the Benesse Art Project commenced in Teshima following a successful project at Naoshima, with the hope of supporting the suffering island residents and helping to recover pride in their island.

The concept of the Benesse Art Project is “coexistence of nature, art, and architecture”, and with this concept it aims to create works that suit the surrounding environment of the venue.</p><p align=""left"">Thus it has served as a venue for projects related to food and art. Artwork has been created based on themes such as “art and a rich diet” and “recovering nature and humanity.” Due to its favorable location in which nature and art are united, along with its fascinating food culture, Teshima attracts visitors from both Japan and abroad as the second largest art island after Naoshima, the world-famous art island.</p><p align=""left""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499316087/qsw0b2moqxut6ualqb5r.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p align=""left""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499317169/nr4my758iwaylmfdq26v.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p align=""left""><i><u>Our Project Summary</u></i></p><p align=""left"">In this new era, Teshima is attracting many more domestic and international visitors as tourists.

While their creativity is making an old neighborhood new again, Sweet Auburn’s historic landmarks—like the Old 4th Ward Water Tower—remain a testament to its storied past.As the oldest surviving water tower in Atlanta, it was built as a state-of-the-art water suppression system for the cotton compress factory next door in 1906. The workers who lived across the street not only saw the water tower when they woke up in the morning, but would occasionally be tasked with scaling the tower’s ladder with buckets of water to fill the top—an adventure not for the faint of heart!For decades, it stood at the ready until the factory closed its doors. Today, the land the tower stands on is known as Water Tower Park, but the tower itself has been tagged with graffiti over the years and has no functional use. The time has come to give this local landmark a little TLC.Success! We're happy to report that our campaign raised $38,415! That's $23,415 above our original goal of $15,000!Thanks to the generous support of our backers, the tower will be revived inside and out. Inside, rubble and garbage will be cleared for future revitalization projects, and so local artists can paint an interior mural depicting the story of Atlanta. On the outside, the structure will be power-washed, and new cast iron windows and a door will be installed.Please stay tuned to the updates section of this page for additional project news.I claimed tickets to the Bruno Mars: 24K Magic World Tour as my perk and have questions.Thank you for supporting our project!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Natelegé Whaley. I'm a journalist, creative, and founder of <a href=""http://heartsconverse.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hearts Converse</a>. Since founding HC in 2010, I have created safe spaces for young adults of color to discuss relationships, life, and culture through blogs, events, and video content.</p>
<p>In 2013, I began looking for a space to host an HC live discussion event. Either the space was too expensive for my budget or the owners weren't interested. I grew anxious and frustrated figuring out how to throw this event.</p>
<p>Then one day, an opportunity fell into my lap. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500668196/xwbjapm27hqgh8awu7hd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In January 2014, a friend invited me to an art showcase event at a small venue space in Brooklyn formerly known as OG Studios. There I met the owner, who was interested in the vision for my event. After a few conversations, and pitching my proposal, he gave me the space to host my event for free.</p>
<p>In March 2014, I launched my <a href=""http://heartsconverse.com/2014/03/20/thekickback-a-conversation-event-no-1-photos/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">first Kickback event</a>! That evening, 30 young adults of color passionately shared and listened to each other's thoughts on the subjects that mattered most to them during the two-hour rap session.</p>

<p>Emotions ran high as we discussed everything from social justice to relationships. We ate, we drank, we healed, and built community. For many participants, this was a rare opportunity to connect on an intimate level with individuals who were just as open to sharing perspectives as they were listening to others share theirs.</p>
<p>My goal was to create a social event that wasn't your traditional ""So what do you do?"" networking! Just something more real. Here that happened.</p>
<p>And I continued. I hosted four more Kickbacks up until December 2015. Now I'm ready to bring it back!</p>

<p>Breather has been a phenomenal space to host #HCKickback events. From experience, I prefer these quiet rooms rather than bars/lounges where the environment can be noisy.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By contributing to this venue fund, you will continue to help provide a safe space for people of color to discuss what matters to them. For many young adults, the weight of racism and other -isms weigh on their emotional and physical health everyday. With this space, I am able to provide my peers an outlet to discuss these issues. <i>Here they are seen.</i> <i>Here they are heard. Here they get to BE.</i></p>
<p><strong>THE CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>Between March 2014 and December 2015, I hosted four more sold-out events. But the cost was heavy. I came out of my pocket and acquired a bit of debt. Even when I asked my participants to pay, it was enough to break even but not enough to make profit. My goal was and still is to keep the event as financially accessible as possible. And I'm asking for my community's monetary support to kickstart this event again.</p>

<p><strong>The Kickback No. 6 Theme: ""CAN I LIVE?!""</strong></p>
<p>The conversation for the forthcoming event will invite participants to discuss how they drown out a noisy society to affirm and BE themselves. We will answer the following questions:</p>

To bi spriječilo nestajanje ovih zanata i omogućilo da nove generacije preuzmu izradu tradicionalnih rukotvorina od svojih predaka. Drugi cilj kampanje je da omogućimo dostupnost ovih proizvoda svima bez obzira gdje se nalazili. </p><p>Mali proizvođači nemaju mogućnost plasmana svojih proizvoda izvan lokalne zajednice zbog velikih transportnih troškova, što daleko smanjuje njihovo tržište. Naš cilj je da prikupimo ove proizvode, plasiramo ih u turističkim centrima i izvezemo ih na inostrana tržišta. Podržavanjem naše kampanje podržavate našu misiju zaštite kulturno-istorijskog nasljeđa, zapošljavate male proizvođače i povećavate njihove prihode od tradicionalnih rukotvorina.</p><h3>Koliko imamo do cilja?</h3><p>Nama je potrebno 6.050 $ (~4.900 €) da obezbijedimo početni kapital da bi stvorili ponudu rukotvorina na jednom mjestu u BiH. Nakon što imamo ponudu, možemo da registrujemo izvoznu djelatnost koja bi nam omogućila da vršimo distribuciju i izvoz tih proizvoda na inostrana tržišta. Mali proizvođači bi imali sigurno tržište što bi njima obezbijedilo stabilne prihode, a nama omogućilo formiranje ponude tradicionalnih rukotvorina za domaće i internacionalno tržište. Ekonomska održivost proizvođača tradicionalnih rukotvorina bi na ovaj način doprinijela trajnoj zaštiti kulturno-istorijskog nasljeđa što je naša osnovna misija!</p><h3>Kako nas podržati?</h3><p>Podržati nas možete donacijom za bilo koji od poklona (kliknete na perk koji želite), a koji se nalaze sa desne strane ili prostim doniranjem (kliknete na back it). Za ovo vam je potrebna bankovna kartica, a ukoliko to prvi put radite pogledajte video: LINK. Ukoliko nemate odgovarajuću bankovnu karticu našu kampanju možete podržati uplatom na račun. Svi koji uplate na račun, zaštićen iznos pod njihovim imenom će biti prenesen na kampanju. Informacije za uplatu iz BiH i inostranstva imate na: <a href=""https://cuvari.org/instrukcije-za-placanje/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://cuvari.org/instrukcije-za-placanje/</a>.</p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522270459/fd6qjzkqhlmg8772pmcs.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><h3>Pokloni</h3><p>Doniranjem za poklon od 5$ dobijate 3 digitalne fotografije visoke rezolucije kulturno-istorijskih spomenika Bosne i Hercegovine, koje možete izraditi u fotografiju, poster ili plakat da ukrašava Vaš dom. Ovo je poklon u elektronskoj formi i za njega se ne plaća poštarina.</p><p>Doniranjem za sve ostale poklone, pored naše kampanje, podstičete i umjetnike koji su ih izradili. Troškovi poštarine zavise od vaše lokacije, ako želite donirati za određeni poklon i preuzeti poklon lično, onda je dovoljno da odete na donate i unesete tačan iznos tog poklona (onda vam poklon neće biti poslan poštom, nego vas čeka u Banjoj Luci od kraja aprila).</p><p>Svi pokloni su u potpunosti ili većim dijelom ručno rađeni, a fotografije perkova (poklona) su orijentacione i mogu biti sa manjim izmjenama. Npr. Ukoliko želite da na šoljicama za čaj budu oslikani Stari most ili Sebilj, a da na tanjiriću piše Mostar/Sarajevo 2018 ili želite da šoljica bude bijela to uopšte nije problem i to ulazi u cijenu poklona. Ali ako želite da umjesto šoljica to bude oslikano na fildžanima, i to nije problem, ali cijena će u slučaju izmjene predmeta na kojem se oslikava biti uvećana zbog veće nabavne cijene fildžana. </p><p>Pojedinačne poklone vam šaljemo odmah nakon završetka kampanje (poslednje sedmice aprila i prve sedmice maja), a poklon pakete za firme i ugostiteljske objekte (zbog većeg broja komada) šaljemo u toku maja (dok se ovi pokloni izrade). </p><p>Uz svaki poklon dobijate i kratku priču o tome šta ste kupili, kako su nastale te tradicionalne rukotvorine ili fotografije kulturno-istorijskih spomenika, po čemu su pokloni jedinstveni i ko je izradio koji poklon (ukratko o autoru). </p><p>Kada nam donirate i dobijete određeni poklon zauzvrat, možete nam napisati u komentarima gdje putuje naš poklon, a mi ćemo vam reći tačnu lokaciju (sela ili grada) iz kojeg putuje taj poklon i minimalan broj kilometara (vazdušnom linijom) koje će poklon da pređe na tom putu!</p><p>Svaki donator će bez obzira na donirani iznos biti evidentiran na posebnom dijelu sajta <a href=""https://www.cuvari.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cuvari.org/</a> sa imenima svih koji su pomogli registrovanje izvozne djelatnosti u socijalnom preduzeću, sa izuzetkom onih koji žele da ostanu anonimni (donirali anonimno). Ukoliko naša inicijativa prikupi malo više sredstava od očekivanih, onda ćemo višak sredstava investirati u obuku mladih ljudi da se počnu baviti proizvodnjom tradicionalnih rukotvorina, odnosno daljoj zaštiti kulturno-istorijskog nasljeđa prostora zapadnog Balkana. Ako naša inicijativa skupi puno više sredstava od očekivanih, onda ćemo formirati i distributivne centre u Hrvatskoj i Srbiji, a u budućnosti isti plan imamo i za Sloveniju, Makedoniju i Crnu Goru.</p><h3>Naš uticaj</h3><p>Vi i mi zajedno činimo da se zaštite kulturno-istorijski spomenici na području Bosne i Hercegovine i bivše Jugoslavije, a prije svega kultura koja je u nekim slučajevima opstala samo kod pojedinaca u malim udaljenim naseljima. Svi trebamo pomoći ovim pojedincima, jer njihovi proizvodi su dugotrajni (na pojedine imate garanciju od 100 godina), proizvedeni sa ljubavlju i nose dio njihovih autora, a služe da njihove porodice obezbijede u nekim slučajevima samo najosnovniju egzistenciju. </p><p>Živimo u modernom, potrošačkom društvu i jako često zaboravljamo ljude koji stoje iza svakog proizvoda. Zbog toga sve češće kupujemo industrijski proizvedene predmete, koje je uglavnom sastavio robot, nego što kupujemo rukotvorine koje nose u sebi dio njihovih autora. Kupovinom industrijski proizvedenih ili još gore proizvoda koje su proizvela djeca u nehumanim uslovima dalekih zemalja podržavate kapitalistički i robovlasnički sistem, a da toga nerijetko niste ni svjesni! Pružanjem podrške našoj kampanji, podržavate i male proizvođače i obezbijeđujete njihovim porodicama zadovoljavanje osnovnih potreba od svog rada!</p><p>Ako niste u prilici da nam donirate, možete nam pomoći i tako što ćete proširiti priču o nama, dijeljenjem ove kampanje na vašoj Facebook stranici, Instagramu, slanjem e-maila prijateljima ili širenjem putem bilo koje druge društvene mreže ili medija. </p><p>Sve dodatne informacije o našoj kampanji možete dobiti putem web sajta: <a href=""https://www.cuvari.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cuvari.org/</a> Na ovom sajtu se mogu registrovati i zainteresovani mali proizvođači rukotvorina sa kojima još nismo ostvarili saradnju. </p><h3>Kontakt</h3><p>Za sve dodatne informacije nas možete kontaktirati u komentarima, putem e-maila: info@cuvari.org ili telefona +38765575985 ili +38765950819.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522270498/fmfwqrppygkediaf2zlc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>Who are the Guardians of Culture?</h2><p>The Guardians of Culture is a group of young people from Bosnia and Herzegovina gathered around a mission that includes protecting the traditional crafts, handicrafts, as well as the historical treasures of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, Macedonia, and Montenegro.</p><p>The main goal of the campaign is to make handcrafted items easily available which would increase the earnings of the manufacturers. This means that they would also have enough money to continue making traditional handcrafted items. Additionally, this would preserve the handicrafts, and younger generations would see it as something that is worth pursuing.

To bi spriječilo nestajanje ovih zanata i omogućilo da nove generacije preuzmu izradu tradicionalnih rukotvorina od svojih predaka. Drugi cilj kampanje je da omogućimo dostupnost ovih proizvoda svima bez obzira gdje se nalazili. Mali proizvođači nemaju mogućnost plasmana svojih proizvoda izvan lokalne zajednice zbog velikih transportnih troškova, što daleko smanjuje njihovo tržište. Naš cilj je da prikupimo ove proizvode, plasiramo ih u turističkim centrima i izvezemo ih na inostrana tržišta. Podržavanjem naše kampanje podržavate našu misiju zaštite kulturno-istorijskog nasljeđa, zapošljavate male proizvođače i povećavate njihove prihode od tradicionalnih rukotvorina.Koliko imamo do cilja?Nama je potrebno 6.050 $ (~4.900 €) da obezbijedimo početni kapital da bi stvorili ponudu rukotvorina na jednom mjestu u BiH. Nakon što imamo ponudu, možemo da registrujemo izvoznu djelatnost koja bi nam omogućila da vršimo distribuciju i izvoz tih proizvoda na inostrana tržišta. Mali proizvođači bi imali sigurno tržište što bi njima obezbijedilo stabilne prihode, a nama omogućilo formiranje ponude tradicionalnih rukotvorina za domaće i internacionalno tržište. Ekonomska održivost proizvođača tradicionalnih rukotvorina bi na ovaj način doprinijela trajnoj zaštiti kulturno-istorijskog nasljeđa što je naša osnovna misija!Kako nas podržati?Podržati nas možete donacijom za bilo koji od poklona (kliknete na perk koji želite), a koji se nalaze sa desne strane ili prostim doniranjem (kliknete na back it). Za ovo vam je potrebna bankovna kartica, a ukoliko to prvi put radite pogledajte video: LINK. Ukoliko nemate odgovarajuću bankovnu karticu našu kampanju možete podržati uplatom na račun. Svi koji uplate na račun, zaštićen iznos pod njihovim imenom će biti prenesen na kampanju. Informacije za uplatu iz BiH i inostranstva imate na: https://cuvari.org/instrukcije-za-placanje/.PokloniDoniranjem za poklon od 5$ dobijate 3 digitalne fotografije visoke rezolucije kulturno-istorijskih spomenika Bosne i Hercegovine, koje možete izraditi u fotografiju, poster ili plakat da ukrašava Vaš dom. Ovo je poklon u elektronskoj formi i za njega se ne plaća poštarina.Doniranjem za sve ostale poklone, pored naše kampanje, podstičete i umjetnike koji su ih izradili. Troškovi poštarine zavise od vaše lokacije, ako želite donirati za određeni poklon i preuzeti poklon lično, onda je dovoljno da odete na donate i unesete tačan iznos tog poklona (onda vam poklon neće biti poslan poštom, nego vas čeka u Banjoj Luci od kraja aprila).Svi pokloni su u potpunosti ili većim dijelom ručno rađeni, a fotografije perkova (poklona) su orijentacione i mogu biti sa manjim izmjenama. Npr. Ukoliko želite da na šoljicama za čaj budu oslikani Stari most ili Sebilj, a da na tanjiriću piše Mostar/Sarajevo 2018 ili želite da šoljica bude bijela to uopšte nije problem i to ulazi u cijenu poklona. Ali ako želite da umjesto šoljica to bude oslikano na fildžanima, i to nije problem, ali cijena će u slučaju izmjene predmeta na kojem se oslikava biti uvećana zbog veće nabavne cijene fildžana. Pojedinačne poklone vam šaljemo odmah nakon završetka kampanje (poslednje sedmice aprila i prve sedmice maja), a poklon pakete za firme i ugostiteljske objekte (zbog većeg broja komada) šaljemo u toku maja (dok se ovi pokloni izrade). Uz svaki poklon dobijate i kratku priču o tome šta ste kupili, kako su nastale te tradicionalne rukotvorine ili fotografije kulturno-istorijskih spomenika, po čemu su pokloni jedinstveni i ko je izradio koji poklon (ukratko o autoru). Kada nam donirate i dobijete određeni poklon zauzvrat, možete nam napisati u komentarima gdje putuje naš poklon, a mi ćemo vam reći tačnu lokaciju (sela ili grada) iz kojeg putuje taj poklon i minimalan broj kilometara (vazdušnom linijom) koje će poklon da pređe na tom putu!Svaki donator će bez obzira na donirani iznos biti evidentiran na posebnom dijelu sajta https://www.cuvari.org/ sa imenima svih koji su pomogli registrovanje izvozne djelatnosti u socijalnom preduzeću, sa izuzetkom onih koji žele da ostanu anonimni (donirali anonimno). Ukoliko naša inicijativa prikupi malo više sredstava od očekivanih, onda ćemo višak sredstava investirati u obuku mladih ljudi da se počnu baviti proizvodnjom tradicionalnih rukotvorina, odnosno daljoj zaštiti kulturno-istorijskog nasljeđa prostora zapadnog Balkana. Ako naša inicijativa skupi puno više sredstava od očekivanih, onda ćemo formirati i distributivne centre u Hrvatskoj i Srbiji, a u budućnosti isti plan imamo i za Sloveniju, Makedoniju i Crnu Goru.Naš uticajVi i mi zajedno činimo da se zaštite kulturno-istorijski spomenici na području Bosne i Hercegovine i bivše Jugoslavije, a prije svega kultura koja je u nekim slučajevima opstala samo kod pojedinaca u malim udaljenim naseljima. Svi trebamo pomoći ovim pojedincima, jer njihovi proizvodi su dugotrajni (na pojedine imate garanciju od 100 godina), proizvedeni sa ljubavlju i nose dio njihovih autora, a služe da njihove porodice obezbijede u nekim slučajevima samo najosnovniju egzistenciju. Živimo u modernom, potrošačkom društvu i jako često zaboravljamo ljude koji stoje iza svakog proizvoda. Zbog toga sve češće kupujemo industrijski proizvedene predmete, koje je uglavnom sastavio robot, nego što kupujemo rukotvorine koje nose u sebi dio njihovih autora. Kupovinom industrijski proizvedenih ili još gore proizvoda koje su proizvela djeca u nehumanim uslovima dalekih zemalja podržavate kapitalistički i robovlasnički sistem, a da toga nerijetko niste ni svjesni! Pružanjem podrške našoj kampanji, podržavate i male proizvođače i obezbijeđujete njihovim porodicama zadovoljavanje osnovnih potreba od svog rada!Ako niste u prilici da nam donirate, možete nam pomoći i tako što ćete proširiti priču o nama, dijeljenjem ove kampanje na vašoj Facebook stranici, Instagramu, slanjem e-maila prijateljima ili širenjem putem bilo koje druge društvene mreže ili medija. Sve dodatne informacije o našoj kampanji možete dobiti putem web sajta: https://www.cuvari.org/ Na ovom sajtu se mogu registrovati i zainteresovani mali proizvođači rukotvorina sa kojima još nismo ostvarili saradnju. KontaktZa sve dodatne informacije nas možete kontaktirati u komentarima, putem e-maila: info@cuvari.org ili telefona +38765575985 ili +38765950819. Who are the Guardians of Culture?The Guardians of Culture is a group of young people from Bosnia and Herzegovina gathered around a mission that includes protecting the traditional crafts, handicrafts, as well as the historical treasures of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, Macedonia, and Montenegro.The main goal of the campaign is to make handcrafted items easily available which would increase the earnings of the manufacturers.

Zum Beispiel,wenn Sie die Alte Brücke oder Sebilj auf den Teetassen gemalt haben möchten oderwenn auf der Untertasse Mostar / Sarajevo 2018 stehen sollte, oder wenn Sie wollen, dass die Tasse weiß ist, macht man das gerne für Sie und das ist schon alles im Preis inkludiert. Aber wenn sie den Wunsch haben, dass man statt auf Tassen, auf Fildzan malt, geht das auch in Ordnung, aber der Preis wird aufgrund des höheren Kaufpreises des Fildzans etwas höher sein.Die individuelle Geschenke werden direkt nach der Beendigung der Kampagne (die letzte Aprilwoche und die erste Maiwoche) und die Pakete für Unternehmen und Catering-Einrichtungen (wegen der Stückzahl) im Mai versendet (bis diese Geschenke angefertigtsind).Mit jedem Geschenk erhalten Sie auch eine kurze Geschichte darüber, was Sie gekauft haben, wie diese traditionellen Handarbeiten oder Fotos von kulturellen und historischen Denkmälern entstanden sind, wieso die Geschenke einzigartig sind und wer welches Geschenk erstellt hat (kurz über den Autor).Wenn sie uns mit ihrer Spende unterstützen und ein bestimmtes Geschenk erhalten, können Sie uns in den Kommentaren schreiben, wo unser Geschenk gelandet ist, und wir werden Ihnen den genauen Ort (Dorf oder Stadt), die Geschenkherstellung und die Mindestanzahl der zurückgelegten Kilometer (Fluglinie) auf diesem Weg offenbaren!Jeder Spender, unabhängig von der Spendensumme, wird auf einemseparatenTeil der Website https://www.cuvari.org/ mit den NamenallerPersonenregistriert, die dazubeigetragenhaben, die ExportaktivitätimSozialunternehmenzuregistrieren, mitAusnahmederjenigen, die anonym bleibenmöchten (anonym gespendet).

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In Feminis Veritas is an Eastern European Women's Festival that started as a student project at the Freie Universität Berlin. Our festival was created in response to the czarny protests in Poland, where the government's decision to restrict abortion rights was met with large-scale protests. We wanted to show solidarity with and bring to light the current plight of women in Eastern Europe who are facing a retraditionalization of gender roles under increasingly repressive governments. The best way to further this message, we believed, was to highlight Eastern European female artists, allowing their art to speak for their experiences and illustrate their political circumstances. From this idea, the festival was born.</p>
<p>The festival last year, included various formats, highlighting and contextualizing the cultural and political situation for women in Eastern Europe. We held a podium discussion on the protests movements in Poland, held a STI-education workshop through a feminist lens, screened an Oscar-nominated short-film, held a digital art exhibition, and presented a reading of a new novel. You can still view all of these events <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8WxJ7yet5URwCijC5fVe4Q"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> on our Youtube page.</p>
<p>This year we want to top our festival from last year! We already have an amazing program and group of artists who are excited to participate in this years festival. Once the program and artist list are finalized, we will published it here as well as on our social media. We've even raised a significant amount of money already through grants. All we need now is an additional 750€ to help put on the best festival possible.</p>
<p>This years festival will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a podium discussion</li>
<li>a short film screening</li>
<li>an art exhibition with live music</li>
<li>a reading from a graphic novel</li>
<li>a workshop on intersectional feminism</li>
<li>a podcast collaboration </li>
</ul>
<p>Any amount you can donate will be greatly appreciated!!</p>
<p><strong>The festival will take place August 20th to 22nd in Berlin, Germany.</strong></p>
<p>Further information on the exact location of the festival will be published as we get closer to the event. There will be no entrance fee for the festival; anyone located in Berlin is more than welcome to join us.

<h3>Cered</h3>
<p>A nemzetközi művésztelep és az Artpiknik otthona a Nógrád megye északkeleti szegletében megbúvó palóc falu, Cered. A település természeti adottságai miatt mindig is el volt szigetelve a nagyvilág zakatolásától, de a felvidéki települések elcsatolása és a falvak elnéptelenedése hatványozottan érezteti itt hatását.</p>
<p>Az aranyzöld domboldalak, a Medves őshonos növény- és állatvilága, a házfalakból áradó palóc szellemiség hagyományai, az utcákon a mindenkinek köszönő helyiek és az a megingathatatlan béke, ami a faluból árad – ezek teszik Ceredet egyedülállóvá. Ezért szerettünk bele 24 évvel ezelőtt.</p>

</h3><p>__________________________________________________________________________________________<br/>__________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p> </p><h3>Summary in English</h3><p>Twenty-four years ago, with a few fellow artists we founded an art colony in a small rural village called Cered in Nógrád County. We have created this community not only to be part of the Hungarian and the European art scene, but to support a collection of values which had been, and still are at risk of becoming extinct. </p><p>We invited contemporary artists from all around the world and let them use this wonderful, unspoilt environment as their inspiration. Every year we gave the selected artists a theme - something connected to Cered, the country life, the loss of village population -  and asked them to try to capture what Cered and these values mean with their art. </p><p>Over the past few years, hundreds of talented people from more than 23 countries have joined us and spread the word of our mission in the world. At the last day of the art colony, we have always organised an open day where we have presented the created artworks to friends and followers.</p><p>Last year the number of visitors has exceeded 200, and even though we have huge families, this unexpected level of interest has surprised us and inevitably has risen a question: Is it possible that this unique encounter of international artists and a tiny Hungarian village could be an interest for others, and not just for us?</p><p>So this year we decided to go after this...</p><p> </p><p>On 10 August 2019 we will organize the 1st Cered ArtPiknik, a contemporary art festival where we will open our gates for the wider public and show what Cered means to us.</p><p>During the event, our guests will have the chance to see the artworks and meet the artists at the house where they have been working and got their inspiration. At the same time, the guests can visit the village and the surrounding area to try local culinary delights, to attend concerts and plays.</p><p>To make this all possible, we have started this crowd-funding campaign and now we need your help. Of course, we won’t ask this as a donation - please check the list of  perks to see how are we planning to thank you for your support. </p><p> </p><ol>

Every year we gave the selected artists a theme - something connected to Cered, the country life, the loss of village population -  and asked them to try to capture what Cered and these values mean with their art. Over the past few years, hundreds of talented people from more than 23 countries have joined us and spread the word of our mission in the world. At the last day of the art colony, we have always organised an open day where we have presented the created artworks to friends and followers.Last year the number of visitors has exceeded 200, and even though we have huge families, this unexpected level of interest has surprised us and inevitably has risen a question: Is it possible that this unique encounter of international artists and a tiny Hungarian village could be an interest for others, and not just for us?So this year we decided to go after this... On 10 August 2019 we will organize the 1st Cered ArtPiknik, a contemporary art festival where we will open our gates for the wider public and show what Cered means to us.During the event, our guests will have the chance to see the artworks and meet the artists at the house where they have been working and got their inspiration. At the same time, the guests can visit the village and the surrounding area to try local culinary delights, to attend concerts and plays.To make this all possible, we have started this crowd-funding campaign and now we need your help. Of course, we won’t ask this as a donation - please check the list of  perks to see how are we planning to thank you for your support.  

„A köszönet” – $3 USDWe will write your name on a house at Cered. This will stay as a proof your generosity forever (or at least until the paint peels off).

„A jegy” - $10 USDIf you choose this perk, you will get a ticket to the ArtPiknik which you can collect at Cered, on the day of the festival.

„Az album” - $25 USDYou will get a ticket, your name will appear on a wall, and beside all this, we will thank you your support with an album about the previous 24 years of the art colony. 

„A páholy” - $100 USDBehind the location of the art colony, there is a small wooden theatre. If you choose this perk, one its will be always yours. We will engrave your name on a seat and of course you will also get a festival ticket. 

„A vázlat” - $500 USDAs one of our main benefactor you will have the opportunity to get the sketch of your favourite artwork. Moreover you will get two tickets to the festival.

„A mű” - $2 500 USDIf you decide to be the one who helps us the most, we will thank your extraordinary support in a unique way, with an artwork of the art colony. Our Founder, Csaba Fürjesi will help you personally to pick the art piece which fits your collection.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

We are grateful to our teens because they bravely took the initiative to educate us about being furry.Thankfully, they didn't give up on us!After initial hesitation, we decided to take our kids to our first convention. We instantly felt welcomed into this amazing community! On the last day of the con, we decided it was our duty to share our experience with other - possibly hesitant - parents. Our first YouTube video garnered more support than we could have ever imagined. We have now become part of this wonderful community.Our overall mission is to share the benefits of the furry fandom and to dispel myths, as well as, negative stereotypes. We believe this fandom is not only appropriate for young furries but also a positive outlet for their creativity and self-expression.As part of our mission, we want to create fun, age-appropriate furry convention activities tailor-made to youths and their families. We are especially proud of our Young Furry Chill Space©, a room where kids and guardians can take a break from con activities and maybe meet friends, make a craft, or just chill out for a while.We hope to expand this space to include special guests that can share share information about crafting, art, and other things kids may want to know.MoFs in Action!""Mom's of Furries do an exceptional job creating a mellow space for young furries to hang out, build friendships and create beautiful art together.

As a lifestyle coach and ACE certified fitness trainer, I help people get fit, healthier and feel better with the right combination of healthy habits, tasty food and smart exercise.<br/><br/>I do workshops about healthy, fit lifestyle at vegan festivals and events and help animal rights organizations promote compassionate messages through public campaigns (see billboard below), on TV and radio.

REAL-LIFE CONNECTION IS THE KEY.</strong></p><p>One thing I realized by going to animal sanctuaries is that connecting with animals face-to-face  made me a better, more motivated promoter of compassionate, vegan lifestyle.

Here is what they are:<br/><br/>- $1400: gas for the car, toll road costs and vignettes (8500 kilometers!)<br/>- $640: printed materials, stickers + shirts to give away, projector, speaker<br/>- $900: song production (studio time, producer, mixing, mastering) and music video production and promotion of the video<br/>- $900: food for me and some food and supplies for IFEEL GOOD PARTIES<br/>- $400: emergency funds for unexpected problems. This will go as donation to our 4 pigs if there are no problems on the road.<br/>- $260: Indiegogo processing fee that Indiegogo will take at the end of campaign<br/>- $700: perks + mailing perks (all the incentives listed + mailing them out)<br/><br/><strong>TOTAL COST = $5200</strong><br/><br/>The bottom line is, I need YOUR SUPPORT AND HELP to make this happen!

LET'S MAKE A POSITIVE IMPACT TOGETHER!</strong><br/><br/>I am confident in my ability to give true value to these communities with this tour, but as far as this campaign goes, I need support. I believe that with your help, IFEEL GOOD TOUR can make a powerful positive impact and not only help people feel better, but also help save animal lives. <i>Because vegan lives help animal lives.</i><br/><br/>Please take a look at the incentives (perks) on the right part of the screen and choose something that you would like to receive. ANY help will be great! Also, please share this link with your friends and people you think might want to support this tour. Help me make a positive impact in 20 communities. I really appreciate your help and hope to see you on the road!<br/><br/><strong>WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF WE REACH MORE THAN THE GOAL</strong><br/><br/>If we happen to collect more funding than our goal, I will expand the tour to more cities, of course! That would be real wild!! The extra funding would also be used for extra promotion of the tour and music video, to have even more impact – during and after the tour is completed.</p><p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong><br/><br/>There is always a chance that our goal is not met. In that case, I might not be able to do the tour and will return the funds to everyone. Or if we raise 80% of the goal, I might still do the tour but will visit less cities and have less events. If there are unexpected difficulties and delays during this tour, I will let you know as soon as possible so you know everything that is happening.

Here is what they are:- $1400: gas for the car, toll road costs and vignettes (8500 kilometers!)- $640: printed materials, stickers + shirts to give away, projector, speaker- $900: song production (studio time, producer, mixing, mastering) and music video production and promotion of the video- $900: food for me and some food and supplies for IFEEL GOOD PARTIES- $400: emergency funds for unexpected problems. This will go as donation to our 4 pigs if there are no problems on the road.- $260: Indiegogo processing fee that Indiegogo will take at the end of campaign- $700: perks + mailing perks (all the incentives listed + mailing them out)TOTAL COST = $5200The bottom line is, I need YOUR SUPPORT AND HELP to make this happen! I am not backed by a music label or a general sponsor for my music, videos or projects. That is why I am reaching out to you to help make this project happen.I NEED YOUR HELP. LET'S MAKE A POSITIVE IMPACT TOGETHER!I am confident in my ability to give true value to these communities with this tour, but as far as this campaign goes, I need support. I believe that with your help, IFEEL GOOD TOUR can make a powerful positive impact and not only help people feel better, but also help save animal lives. Because vegan lives help animal lives.Please take a look at the incentives (perks) on the right part of the screen and choose something that you would like to receive. ANY help will be great! Also, please share this link with your friends and people you think might want to support this tour. Help me make a positive impact in 20 communities. I really appreciate your help and hope to see you on the road!WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF WE REACH MORE THAN THE GOALIf we happen to collect more funding than our goal, I will expand the tour to more cities, of course! That would be real wild!! The extra funding would also be used for extra promotion of the tour and music video, to have even more impact – during and after the tour is completed.RISKS AND CHALLENGESThere is always a chance that our goal is not met. In that case, I might not be able to do the tour and will return the funds to everyone. Or if we raise 80% of the goal, I might still do the tour but will visit less cities and have less events. If there are unexpected difficulties and delays during this tour, I will let you know as soon as possible so you know everything that is happening. I promise to keep you informed about this entire tour because it is our project.Let's make it happen! Thank you.Dragan (IFEEL)",3.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<h2>The Infringement Festival</h2>
<p>BIF is a vital part of Buffalo's art culture, and a summer tradition that's been going strong for 14 years. We have acts that cover theater, music, art, dance, spoken word, film, and even some artists that defy genre categorizations altogether.  All proceeds---cover charges, pass-the-hat donations---go directly to the artists, with the bare minimum set aside to cover technical expenses. We need your financial help to produce the festival program and cover technical expenses.</p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We will self-publish and distribute our map and event calendar this year. We also rent PA and stage gear for a limited number of venues.</p>
<p>We still need about $1500, on top of what we've raised through fundraiser concerts.</p>
<p>Every little bit counts. We've never fallen short, and with your help, 2010 will be no different.</p>
<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>We are the largest (but not the only) festival of our kind. Although the original Infringement Festival was started and is still run in Montreal, QC by one of the original founders, Buffalo's festival is the only one that has expanded to 11 days and 400+ artists.</p>
<p>Your donation supports artists. It allows for works to be presented both in interesting, unique spaces and by artists who do not normally get a lot of exposure. We cover a range of aesthetics, experience-levels, and we allow artists to get out of their comfort zones and present original, new, and challenging work.</p>
<p>Your donation also supports audiences. Without the people who come out to shows, this festival would not continue to exist.</p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>There is always the risk of a budgetary shortfall, or that some venue will suddenly close. Our organizer committee is our biggest strength. Collectively, we have 100+ years of experience making this thing a reality. We are also constantly bringing in new people to help us figure out how to make things happen.</p>

This year is going to be the biggest and best fest yet, with over three times as many exhibitors as our last Fest!</strong></p><p>The Fest is a free, fun, and engaging event open to the general public and appropriate for all ages. At the heart of the event is an exhibition featuring 70+ zine creators, collectives, distributors, retailers, libraries, and small presses sharing their amazing work and showcasing the diversity of expression made possible by independent- and self-publishing. We invite you to come buy zines directly from the creators, learn about zine libraries and places you can buy zines both locally and online, and even learn to make a zine of your own at our kid-friendly Zine Creation Station!</p><p><strong>This year we are celebrating Zine Fest Eve (aka Leap Night: 2/29) with an informal mixer, group zine release party, and zine reading at Buzz Mill Shady!</strong> We’ll be hanging out from 7-9pm with an hour-long zine reading starting at 7:30. Come by to celebrate the Eve of the Fest and toast all the zine creators with fresh material out for 2020!</p><p>Here are some of the things folks have to say after attending Lone Star Zine Fest:</p><ul>
<li>“I liked the variety of exhibitors as well as the zine creation space.”</li>
<li>“Great selection/curation of artists, themes, and subject matter.”</li>
<li>“I loved the diversity of the zine artists represented and the general vibe of the event. I walked away with amazing art and a warm, fuzzy feeling in my belly. &lt;3”</li>
<li>“The energy!! Everyone seemed genuinely happy to be there and open to chatting about their work.”</li>
<li>“As a zinester, I loved how open all of the vendors were to trading/looking at my zine! It was awesome to have librarians there as well.”</li>
<li>“It made me feel like I was home. Being mixed race and queer doesn’t give you a lot of safe places, but this one felt really special. I’m so happy that people are out here creating this art and spending their time to keep this community growing. I felt inspired and am now working on making a zine to contribute next year!”</li>
<li>“I love everything about it, truly.”</li>

<p>ABOUT US: </p>
<p>My name is Camile Elizabeth Messerley, I am a current senior at the Kansas City Art Institute where I am finishing up my thesis project in the converging media and art history department. Over the last two years I have been developing a studio practice based around reciprocal generosity, this simply means that I am devoted to cultivated, rich relationships and uplifting the community around me through the organizing of events and public programs to the curation of exhibitions and performances. This indiegogo campaign has been created to support the events for W/in ~ W/o and the artists taking part and leading projects.</p> <p>W/in ~ W/ois a project stemming from this original concept to better understand the way we as individuals may exchange methods of support with others. W/in ~ W/o: Support + the NeoNoAge is construction project. The construction consists of a breathing archival catalog, a mobile space for community gatherings and artist projects.</p> <p>The questions that I am posing to both myself, my collaborators, and my greater community is—how do we positively construct systems of support within Kansas City, who has a wealth of inspiring communal spaces, and aid in regenerating or join those spaces that are already in place?</p> <p>The concept of the NeoNoAge is what the project is centered on.

</div></div>","ABOUT US: 
My name is Camile Elizabeth Messerley, I am a current senior at the Kansas City Art Institute where I am finishing up my thesis project in the converging media and art history department. Over the last two years I have been developing a studio practice based around reciprocal generosity, this simply means that I am devoted to cultivated, rich relationships and uplifting the community around me through the organizing of events and public programs to the curation of exhibitions and performances. This indiegogo campaign has been created to support the events for W/in ~ W/o and the artists taking part and leading projects. W/in ~ W/ois a project stemming from this original concept to better understand the way we as individuals may exchange methods of support with others. W/in ~ W/o: Support + the NeoNoAge is construction project. The construction consists of a breathing archival catalog, a mobile space for community gatherings and artist projects. The questions that I am posing to both myself, my collaborators, and my greater community is—how do we positively construct systems of support within Kansas City, who has a wealth of inspiring communal spaces, and aid in regenerating or join those spaces that are already in place? The concept of the NeoNoAge is what the project is centered on. This is a term that works as a seam between contemporary artists as facilitators who engage with questions of power—power in relation to the agency each one of us holds, as well as a more scientific definition of power, being the rate at which work is performed or energy is expended.

<p><strong>CHI SIAMO</strong></p>
<p>Siamo un gruppo di giovani artisti di tutta italia, che ha deciso di fare dell’arte la propria vocazione di vita e che credono che un mondo senza arte smetterebbe di interrogarsi e di sognare e che non avrebbe né interesse nel passato né curiosità per il futuro.</p>
<p><strong>COSA VOGLIAMO FARE</strong></p>
<p>Il <strong>12 maggio 2018</strong> vogliamo dare il via alla prima edizione dell’<strong>AlfredClown Festival</strong> a Bosconero, un festival di teatro e arti di strada.</p>
<p><strong>LA NOSTRA IDEA</strong></p>
<p>L’idea del Festival nasce da <strong>Alfredo</strong>, cuore pulsante del nostro gruppo, che grazie alla sua personalità e al suo talento naturale ci ha ispirato, regalato sorrisi e insegnamenti di vita preziosi.</p>
<p>Con il Festival vogliamo coinvolgere la città di <strong>Bosconero</strong> tutta e farlo diventare il pretesto per sfogare l’identità clownesca di tutti coloro che parteciperanno.</p>
<p>Un giorno di <strong>grande festa</strong> in cui tutto sia consentito, in cui si possa giocare seriamente, come una piccola finestra colorata da cui guardare il mondo con occhi diversi!</p>
<p><strong>COME VOGLIAMO FARLO</strong></p>
<p>Per fare questo non ci interessa lavorare da soli ma vogliamo provare a <strong>coinvolgere</strong> attivamente tutto il paese e chiunque voglia dare il suo contributo. Vogliamo attivare logiche comunitarie, coinvolgere associazioni locali, categorie sociali di ogni tipo e chiunque condivida con noi i nostri stessi intenti in un’ottica di <strong>libero lavoro e libero scambio</strong>. Crediamo che questa possa essere un’occasione di <strong>crescita</strong> importante individuale e collettiva, sia per noi che per Bosconero!</p>
<p>Partendo dal basso ed essendo la nostra prima edizione, abbiamo deciso di lanciare sul web una campagna di crowdfunding per finanziare il nostro progetto!<br/>Ma abbiamo bisogno anche del tuo <strong>contributo</strong>.</p>

<h2><strong>What is POMADA?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>It is a queer culture festival which takes place in Warsaw.</p></li>
<li><p>It is an independent initiative organized by artists, curators, producers, enthusiasts of nonheteronormative mazes of human desire and anyone who wants to participate.</p></li>
<li><p>It includes an exhibition, performances, concerts, film screenings and parties.</p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What do we do?</strong></h2>
<p>Since 2010 we have been inviting people to nonheteronormative meetings. We discuss the body, sexuality, alternative family concepts, functioning in the public sphere, the media, queer spirituality. POMADA is created thanks to the combined efforts of many volunteers as well as organizations and institutions, which support the initiative through their involvement.</p>
<p>This year the slogan SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPES takes us to the past and to the future, which both require some thorough queering. Does Poland have any queer heritage and if so, what is it?</p>
<p>We won’t be able to answer this question without your help!</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise funds necessary to create an artistic program which will stand out against heteronormative artistic events organized in Poland – mainly exhibitions at public institutions and art galleries. Currently it is difficult to find at least one cultural proposition which would be openly queer.</p>
<p>Help us organize three completely queer days in Warsaw, during which you will take part in free<strong> </strong>artistic events.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What will POMADA 7 include?</h2>
<p><i>The HERITAGE exhibition</i>, where 19th and 20th century writers, secret revolutionaries, contemporary and past artists will reveal stories which the Polish society – shamed – blocked out.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The event <i>SZYMANOWSKI &amp; THE BOYFRIENDS</i> will liven up the 18th century palace with the great composer Karol Szymanowski’s music. “Roxana’s Song” from King Roger, The Swan or Mazurkas will be performed by the (Dwóch) głos duo.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>During the <i>NIGHT WITH VIDEOTAPES</i> we will show a curious collection of adult films made available by Krzysztof Jung. The videotapes, which the neo avant-garde artist brought to Poland in the 1980s, will inspire the performative night meeting with porn.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>In order to present the practices of queering history we will show, for the first time in Poland, films by Colombian artist <i>CARLOS MOTT</i>A. The artist, who recovers the queer heritage of pre-Columbian history, has already exhibited his work at New York’s The New Museum and MoMA PS1 as well as at London’s Tate Modern, among others.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>You will be able to join us for <i>performative tours</i> of the Heritage exhibition, which will liven up our queer archive. The artists will merge their private stories and fascinations with works of masters, and reinterpret passages from Polish literature.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Life, my dear, lasts as long as a dance!” During POMADA’S final evening artists from Warsaw and Berlin will present, with their dance concert <i>MAKE QUEER FUTURE AGAIN</i>, fragments of their works from the past and the future, concerning time, history and provisional utopias. Will we recognize queer when it returns?</p>
<p>You can read more about the program and the festival guests at: <a href=""http://www.pomadapomada.pl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.pomadapomada.pl</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why is organizing POMADA so important now?</h2>
<p>The current situation in Poland – governed by a populist-rightist party, which has been continuously attempting at curtailing civil rights – is resulting in a clear violation of democratic liberties.

</div></div>","What is POMADA?

It is a queer culture festival which takes place in Warsaw.
It is an independent initiative organized by artists, curators, producers, enthusiasts of nonheteronormative mazes of human desire and anyone who wants to participate.
It includes an exhibition, performances, concerts, film screenings and parties.

 
What do we do?
Since 2010 we have been inviting people to nonheteronormative meetings. We discuss the body, sexuality, alternative family concepts, functioning in the public sphere, the media, queer spirituality. POMADA is created thanks to the combined efforts of many volunteers as well as organizations and institutions, which support the initiative through their involvement.
This year the slogan SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPES takes us to the past and to the future, which both require some thorough queering. Does Poland have any queer heritage and if so, what is it?
We won’t be able to answer this question without your help!
Our goal is to raise funds necessary to create an artistic program which will stand out against heteronormative artistic events organized in Poland – mainly exhibitions at public institutions and art galleries. Currently it is difficult to find at least one cultural proposition which would be openly queer.
Help us organize three completely queer days in Warsaw, during which you will take part in free artistic events.
 
What will POMADA 7 include?
The HERITAGE exhibition, where 19th and 20th century writers, secret revolutionaries, contemporary and past artists will reveal stories which the Polish society – shamed – blocked out.
*
The event SZYMANOWSKI & THE BOYFRIENDS will liven up the 18th century palace with the great composer Karol Szymanowski’s music. “Roxana’s Song” from King Roger, The Swan or Mazurkas will be performed by the (Dwóch) głos duo.
*
During the NIGHT WITH VIDEOTAPES we will show a curious collection of adult films made available by Krzysztof Jung. The videotapes, which the neo avant-garde artist brought to Poland in the 1980s, will inspire the performative night meeting with porn.
*
In order to present the practices of queering history we will show, for the first time in Poland, films by Colombian artist CARLOS MOTTA. The artist, who recovers the queer heritage of pre-Columbian history, has already exhibited his work at New York’s The New Museum and MoMA PS1 as well as at London’s Tate Modern, among others.
*
You will be able to join us for performative tours of the Heritage exhibition, which will liven up our queer archive. The artists will merge their private stories and fascinations with works of masters, and reinterpret passages from Polish literature.
*
“Life, my dear, lasts as long as a dance!” During POMADA’S final evening artists from Warsaw and Berlin will present, with their dance concert MAKE QUEER FUTURE AGAIN, fragments of their works from the past and the future, concerning time, history and provisional utopias. Will we recognize queer when it returns?
You can read more about the program and the festival guests at: www.pomadapomada.pl.
 
Why is organizing POMADA so important now?
The current situation in Poland – governed by a populist-rightist party, which has been continuously attempting at curtailing civil rights – is resulting in a clear violation of democratic liberties. The government is trying to exert pressure on NGOs, threatening their existence, which directly affects the LGBTQ community in terms of both legal regulations and their well-being. It causes us great concern to see growing consent for hate speech in the public sphere, most often targeted against minorities. At the same time, the authorities have been making attempts at manipulating history, writing it anew, with voices of nonheteronormative individuals or movements being not so much marginalized, as completely ignored. In the current situation we can’t really count on official funding for cultural events which openly tackle queer or feminist issues – that is why it is so crucial, in this difficult time for Poland, to provide financial support to the festival.
 
What will we do with the money?
As a self-organizing team we are for the first time openly asking for financial support in order to make POMADA 7 a reality. The funds which you will provide will, first and foremost, allow us to cover the travel and accommodation expenses of artists coming from outside of Warsaw and the costs of the organization of the exhibition and the accompanying events (transportation, printing posters and flyers, promotion, set design, equipment rental).

<h2>TALENT TIME NEEDS YOUR HELP</h2>
<h3>Talent Time is special. Its unique brand of irreverent humour doesn’t work so well in the world of corporate sponsorships or government grants. We don’t want to have to tone down and behave, and we know our fans don’t want us to either. This crowdfunding campaign is our best shot at making a go of it so, if you love Talent Time just the way it is and you want to show your support, please donate!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I’ve always been curious about normal people with intriguing hobbies and I’m drawn to unique personalities, ones that others might consider strange. And people expressing themselves simply for the pure pleasure of being alive! These people are often ignored by shiny mainstream entertainment.</p>
<p>Talent Time cuts through the boredom of people trying to be something they’re not, or trying to be fancy, and gets to the heart of what makes people want to share their passions in the first place. We dig into what makes raw expression so captivating. </p>
<p>Paul Anthony’s Talent Time launched 2008 in the basement of the Biltmore Cabaret in Vancouver, BC. Canada. Within 6 months we were shooting the live show and editing it into half-hour episodes that aired on public access television.  Things were going well... until last year, when Shaw TV cancelled all community programming.  We are still being broadcast on Novus TV but they are a smaller company and don’t have the equipment we need. </p>
<p>Talent Time is a crazy undertaking...shooting for grandiose production, virtually every month for a decade without any real budget? It has only been possible because people saw what I was doing and felt passionate that Talent Time had to continue. They felt it was important to celebrate our differences with ridiculous fun.  </p>
<p>On the surface, this show shouldn't work. There are too many contrasting elements. On any other show putting a comedian on after a marching band would be death. It's the open honesty and genuine spectacle that allow it all to come together. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Nitty-Gritty</h2>
<p>We are only crowd funding for the actual cost of renting all the camera gear, headsets, video mixer, sound technician, BNC cable etc for 9 episodes. We are prepared to pay for all other costs with what we collect from the door. </p>
<h3>If we can raise $11k we can rent the gear necessary to do an 11th season. If we don't raise $11k all your donations will be returned and Talent Time throws in the towel for good.</h3>
<p><strong>However! If we can raise $17k we can BUY most of the gear necessary to produce the show into infinity.</strong></p>
<p>If we own the gear we won't have to struggle every month... we won't have to beg, borrow, and steal to make one show happen at a time. Struggling so much has affected the quality of some episodes. If we can be self-sufficient we can put all our focus and resources into making Talent Time bigger and better, forever!</p>
<p>This show isn't easy to do, but my incredible crew &amp; I are dedicated to bringing you rare and spectacular entertainment. We have the skill and passion. All we need is your support. Together we can do this!</p>
<p>We're not just begging for money, we have some great perks to offer you too:</p>
<p>- You can sit in with the house band on an instrument of your choice!</p>
<p>- We all know how tricky it can be to fit a hair cut into our busy schedules. Get your hair cut at the Rio while waiting for the show to begin from our hair sponsors Craft Academy Salon!</p>
<p>- Out-of-towners? Apart from various ""endorphin rush"" packages and ""Talent Time Forever"" shirts you can choose a theme for a show we must produce, provide the video loop for the monitor in my desk, or become a producer! All producers will have business cards made for them with the Talent Time logo, your position and name. There is no telling the value of this perk in all the free lunches you could also win!</p>
<p>- New gift certificates added weekly from local businesses wanting to help. This is a great option to support the show while receiving a comparable value in good &amp; services.</p>
<p>- Many more perks on the perk page, with new ones added often so please check back frequently. </p>

<h2>What Talent Time Means</h2>
<p>I've received so many emails and phone calls over the years from people and groups whose experiences on Talent Time have enriched their life so much that they felt compelled to reach out.</p>
<p>Groups like Antique Gold; who were named Best Senior Citizen Barbershop Quartet in world (2006). They were nervous beforehand, worried the crowd wouldn't like them as it was a younger audience than they were used to playing for. Afterwards, they said Talent Time was the best audience they had ever experienced. The support and appreciation – standing ovation and selfies with people – was unexpected and gave them a sense of belonging that they hadn't felt in a while.</p>
<p>The good news is…8 episodes of Talent Time have been picked up by Amazon’s Prime Video who boast 80 million subscribers.  Also a partial archive has been picked up by virtually every public library in North America through Hoopla. This is just proof that people are connecting with it and want to see more.  But Amazon is not producing new episodes of our show so if we want to go further, we need to do it ourselves.</p>
<p>The media have also been very supportive of the show. Here are some selected quotes:</p>
<p><strong>""Something of a phenomenon""</strong> - The Vancouver Sun</p>
<p><strong>“There is no funner night out ”</strong> - The Georgia Straight</p>
<p><strong>""Talent Time is the most innovative, raucus, totally silly and inspired show I have seen in years.  Watching it is like freebasing sheer fun!""</strong>  - Matthew Hays, independent journalist for the Globe &amp; Mail/CBC Arts Online)</p>
<p><strong>""I just loved it.  You don't see this kind of show in Vancouver.  I highly recommend it.""</strong> - Jaeny Baik, CBC Radio</p>
<p><strong>""The single best live event in Vancouver...an unforgettable - epic even - night of entertainment""</strong> - Bob Kronbauer, Vancouver Is Awesome</p>
<p><strong>""A cult phenomenon that’s been flying under the radar...since 2008. A true comedy original. Talent Time defies genre. You have to experience it to truly appreciate it.""</strong> - The Georgia Straight </p>
<p>We are living in very unsettling times. I think the question becomes: what do you want to see more of in the world?  I think it’s important to oppose terrible things happening in our society but I believe it’s equally important to then focus your energy on things that cultivate positive momentum and connection. We cannot give into the politics of division. Community celebrations are actually a powerful political act.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2>We Need Your Help...</h2>
<h3>...And we'll take whatever we can get!</h3>
<p>We've been successfully pulling off strong shows virtually every month for a decade. We've proven that we can do this. I've been putting on a version of this show my whole life. It's maybe the only thing I know how to do. We have a very talented rotating cast and crew. We have an audience for both the live show &amp; the TV show. We have great local businesses supporting us through with goods &amp; services. We have received nothing but glowing reviews from the media and we are just on the precipice of being noticed on a much larger scale. To throw in the towel now would be so depressing.  </p>
<p>All we need is a lil' bit of moolah.</p>
<p>If you can’t help with money right now but you have some skills or energy you want to contribute, please reach out. If all you are able to do right now is share this campaign, that is still something…Please don’t let it stop here.

Our history and our mission </strong></p><p><a href=""http://placemates.ru/en"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>PlaceMates</strong></a> — it’s a project about loving Russia.

During the 70s and 80s, the cinephile was born and the cinematographic movement expanded nationally. The Cinemateca became a place to meet, reflect, and discuss for both filmmakers and film-goers alike; who gathered in this red curtain room to experience the enchantment of the 35 mm projector.

La ciudad, durante los años 70 y 80, lideró a nivel nacional el movimiento cinéfilo y cinematográfico, y la Cinemateca fue el lugar de encuentro, reflexión y discusión tanto de realizadores como de espectadores que se formaron en esta sala de cortinas rojas ante el encanto de las proyecciones en 35 mm. Quedan grabadas en la memoria las largas filas para las películas de la nueva ola, el nuevo cine latinoamericano, el cine político europeo.En el nuevo milenio, las transformaciones de la industria y las estrategias de distribución, así como las crisis económicas, debilitaron su presencia en el panorama de la cultura nacional.A pesar de las dificultades, durante los últimos años La Tertulia ha logrado generar nuevamente interés por la Cinemateca y reavivar su presencia en la agenda cultural de la ciudad. Se han realizado transformaciones en su infraestructura gracias al apoyo del Ministerio de Cultura. En 2016 se adquirió un proyector digital DCP, con sonido Dolby 5.1. La Cinemateca se reincorporó al circuito de exhibición y la programación ha elevado su nivel con estrenos, directores invitados, muestras y festivales internacionales.Sin embargo, aún nos queda mucho por mejorar.La Nueva CinematecaNos estamos reinventando, convertiremos a la Cinemateca La Tertulia en una plataforma vital de exhibición y experimentación audiovisual, en un espacio de encuentro para la ciudad  y una ventana a la cinematografía internacional más relevante. Tras adecuaciones técnicas, hoy nos preparamos para reformas físicas que cambiarán por siempre el rostro de nuestra Sala; cambiaremos nuestros pisos, silletería e iluminación gracias al apoyo del Ministerio de Cultura, pero aún quedan  aspectos por mejorar para convertirnos en la Cinemateca que soñamos.Lanzamos este Crowdfunding para invitar a nuestro público a hacer parte de nuestra transformación.Con tu apoyo lograremos
Terminar el proceso de renovación del espacio (una nueva cartelera, ingreso a la sala y taquilla).
Reforzar la programación con líneas que incorporen, además de los géneros clásicos, los nuevos modos de experimentación y los cruces contemporáneos con otros formatos y disciplinas.
Invitar a más directores, editores, actores, músicos, programadores, artistas y otros colegas a que expandan nuestros conocimientos sobre el cine y las artes cinemáticas.
Editar una serie de publicaciones que nos permitan ir más allá de las proyeccionese incentivar la crítica cinematográfica y la investigación.
Iniciar el proceso de conservación de nuestro archivo de afiches que cuenta con casi 3.000 ejemplares.
Al Sumarte a #LaNuevaCinematecaLa Tertulia tendrá de nuevo una sala de proyección de primer nivel, con una oferta cinematográfica alternativa y una agenda de eventos e invitados que fomentará la formación de públicos.

The Cinemateca became a place to meet, reflect, and discuss for both filmmakers and film-goers alike; who gathered in this red curtain room to experience the enchantment of the 35 mm projector.

<h3>Why do I want to participate in the #LSUC2019?</h3>

At LSUC2019 I would like to continue the constructive reflection that I have already started here, in 2016, <strong>to explore and stimulate a debate</strong> on unlearning preconceptions about the perception of women's bodies and women's cycles.</p>
<p><strong>A meaningful dialogue </strong>on a theme that concerns more than half of the world's population and, yet, is still a taboo, surrounded by a halo of shame, not only in developing countries, but all over the world, including  my country, Italy.</p>

<h3>Why #REDvolutionaryWeaving?</h3>
<p><strong>Since 2012</strong> I have been working on<strong> embodied leadership for women</strong> through the <i><strong>#REDvolutionary Weaving</strong></i> project,  a pedagogical method based on listening to the body's intelligence, using the<strong> archetype of weaving with the red thread</strong>. This is connected with the ability of women to <strong>create networks</strong>, at all levels. It  intertwine, metaphorically and literally, the stories and roots, dreams and talents of women of all ages, coming from from different countries.</p>

<h3>Who has participated in this project so far?</h3>
<p>This project started in Italy and brought me to  Lithuania, France, Belarus, Hungary, Switzerland, Turkey, India, Greece, England.

<h3>What can be my contribution to the LSUC 2019?</h3>
<p>I would like to offer sessions on this subject open to women and men, to broaden the perspective in an eco-systemic way.. My goal is to recover a positive vision of the women's cycle as a powerful tool for empowerment for women of all ages.</p>

<h3>Why do I want to return to this event in India?</h3>
<p>The pedagogy of unlearning and sustainability, in India, has solid and deep roots.<br/>Gandhi's  motto, <i><strong>""Be the change you want to see in the world</strong></i>"", has inspired the changemakers of the world for generations. India is an exporter of best practices on the culture of change. And these best practices have inspired my work in recent years. My participation in LSUC in 2016 allowed me to meet professionals who have <strong>planted seeds for a profound transformation</strong> in my professional and personal life.</p>

<h3>More on my relationship to India</h3>
<p>In India I had other significant experiences, always connected to the pedagogy of unlearning and  the awareness of the body. In November 2015 I was invited as an artist in residence for a month at the Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology, in Bangalore, to work with a group of 16 female students and an Industrial Design teacher, Tulip Sinha Neel, to develop a creative project on this topic.</p>

In November 2015 I was invited as an artist in residence for a month at the Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology, in Bangalore, to work with a group of 16 female students and an Industrial Design teacher, Tulip Sinha Neel, to develop a creative project on this topic.

 
This is the agenda of my sessions at LSUC 2019

reclaiming a positive vision of the menstrual cycle as a powerful tool of empowerment for women of all ages (with presentation of the international project #REDvolutionaryWeaving, on emodied female leadership)
the need to de-stigmatize words like “menstrual” and “menopause”
the right to menstruate and to have access to menstrual hygiene for women all over the world
the need to bring together activists, practitioners, funders, and academics to discuss about it
the need to inform men as well. And to involve them in the conversation (menstruation is NOT a “woman” but a “human” issue)
the need to involve mainstream media in this conversation

 
 
Why contribute to my fundraising campaign?Your contribution can make the difference!
I decided to create this fundraiser to raise  awareness on this topic and involve, both women and men. I ask for your support to promote a pedagogy in favor of the dignity of women's bodies, and to cultivate a new way of relating to one's body, both for adolescents and for women of all ages.I would  like to be supported also by  fathers and teachers of teenage girls.
 
How can you support me?
Any form of generosity you wish to offer is welcome:
-  You can help me sharing this campaign with your friends and contacts and spreading the word.
-  with financial support to cover costs 

travel (visa, international flight from Italy to India and domestic flights)
accommodation
 initial investment in communication, to make this project take off. I calculated a cost of  3,000€ for the first phase, which covers the period from December to April 2019.

 
Every donation, no matter how small or big,  will be greatly valued and will make a difference. Each person that supports this initiative will be updated at least once when I am in India and upon my return.
 
The outputs of the first phase of the project
December 2018 - April 2019:  - a video that tells the experience of LSUC,- a short informative e-book for men (thought especially for fathers of teenage girls)
 
MY GIFTS TO THANK YOU
I am also willing to give something in return (see Perks on the right side of page): I created some packages for individuals. 
I can also offer
- group facilitation - collaborations with companies, schools, associations.  Please contact me privately to discuss tailor made sessions that would include training on the theme of 'embodied leadership, harvesting of the experience in India, individual coaching for HR professionals.
 
Time frame
The conference starts on January  15th and ends on the 20th. I will travel to India on January 6th.

<h3><strong>ZORA'S HOUSE IS A PLACE WHERE WOMEN OF COLOR COME TO WORK, PLAY, AND SOCIALIZE.</strong></h3>
<p>Something magical happens when dope women gather in spaces created specifically with them in mind. Friendships are formed. Business ideas are hatched. Careers are elevated. Wine is consumed!</p>
<p>Zora’s House is just such a space!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507046344/v2miech45yxonyr1vpn3.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Part social club, part coworking studio, part workshop and event space, at Zora’s House you can curl up with a new Toni Morrison book one day, attend a workshop on self-love or marketing a passion based business the next, and wrap up the week with a yoga class infused with jazz music and spoken word poetry.</p>
<h3><strong>614 TAKEOVER.</strong></h3>
<p>When I first moved to Columbus in the summer of 2015, I was immediately homesick for the life that I had left behind.</p>
<p>I started looking for places that would allow me to meet like-minded women of color friends and events that spoke to my interests, but was frustrated to find that many events were either ""social"" or ""professional,"" and none of the programming or places I came across were really dedicated to helping me cultivate meaningful relationships or build my long-term local support system.</p>
<p>I finally realized that what I was looking for didn't exist. And from there, the idea for Zora's House was born.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507046382/ip2nshd1sbjmbny3ab60.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Zora's House is founded on the belief that women of color in Columbus deserve a beautiful place to work, teach, learn, and meet others, and that’s exactly what we’re creating.</p>
<h3><strong>COMMUNITY + OPPORTUNITY.</strong></h3>
<p>The coworking space is the easiest thing to point to, but Zora’s House is more than a workplace. We also offer classes, skills training, a library full of books by women of color authors, meeting space, a residency program, and evening events. The heart of Zora’s House is our community of like-minded women who support, collaborate with, and learn from one another.</p>
<h3><strong>PROVEN MODEL. EXPANDED REACH.</strong></h3>
<p>In February of 2016, we started a Meetup group called Zora’s Daughters to test the market desire for a space like Zora’s House. In the months since, our group has grown to over nine hundred members and we have hosted fourteen events (including book club meetings, pop up coworking sessions, leadership workshops, and more) reaching over three hundred women in our target community.</p>

<p>In other words, the transformative power of community and empowerment that Zora’s House is founded on has already begun to transform the lives of women of color in Columbus. Now with the opening of Zora’s House, we are looking to expand our community, our programming, and our impact!</p>

<h3><strong>CAN'T AFFORD TO SUPPORT FINANCIALLY?</strong></h3>
<p>If you can imagine what it takes for a twenty-something year old black girl to vision, build, and operate her own space dedicated to women of color and their joy, success, and magic - then it shouldn't surprise you when I say that in a world constantly telling me to dream smaller, I am humbled by each and every person who supports this campaign - financially or otherwise.</p>

In order to make room for one of the largest urban parks in the world, the current master plan for Yongsan National Urban Park plans to demolish more than 90% of approximately 1,000 existing buildings inside the base. Once the buildings and places are removed, stories and memories of the place will also vanish into the past.</p><p>Because it was an active military base, everything had to be kept secret. But after almost 70 years of Seoul’s rapid growth completely encapsulated the garrison making it an “urban archaeological site.” To many Seoulites, Yongsan Garrison is a “black hole” sitting in the middle of a megapolis. So naturally, mysteries and mostly stigma tend brew because there are so many things unknown. Many first time visitors inside the base are remarkably underwhelmed because the base doesn’t quite live up to their imaginations.</p><p>Most people only see buildings built in various periods, and this is a part of a memory, but the buildings and the places are only empty shells once USFK move out of Yongsan Garrison. The project is interested in archiving the “soft memories”: human stories and interactions of people who spent time inside the base.</p><p>Yongsan Legacy began because we found many layers of Korea that are locked up inside the base; Stories that are not buried by modern steel and glass developments or under luxury-branded coats and dresses of Koreans today. For outsiders, Yongsan Garrison offers an opportunity to see the remarkable progress that Koreans have made since the Japanese Colonial times, and for Korean nationals, the base provides a chance to pause and reflect on their past and appreciate the present day.</p><p>The story of Yongsan Garrison does not stop at the boundaries of the base; its influence and connection reach well beyond the adjacent neighborhoods and the country. I wish people remember that there were people worked and lived on Yongsan Garrison. To me, people who passed through Yongsan Garrison over the last 70 years are the most precious assets of Yongsan Garrison. Since it is an American base, people will assume that I’m talking about 2.5 million Americans veterans who went through the base. But , in fact, about 60-70% of the people who work inside the base are Koreans and KATSUSA’s. And there were thousands of family members of the soldiers who spent time on the base doing shopping, going to church and going to school on the base. But the most people who benefited from those people are Koreans who lived in and around Yongsan Garrison and families and friends who are appreciative and naturally curious about this “beautiful country.”</p><p><strong>Why do we need Yongsan Legacy Podcast?</strong></p><p>Yongsan Legacy project is currently website-based community/crowd sourcing project. We have a fully customized website for the project linked to Facebook and Instagram designed specifically seek out those individuals who have served and lived on the base. From the beginning of the project, the team felt strongly about having offline meetings to better understand the community and individuals who support this project.</p><p>We have conducted more than 100 personal interviews and organized 5 open-to-public lectures by individuals who wanted share their stories related to Yongsan Garrison. After having the five talks, it was clear that not many people were eager to stand in front of people. And the team wanted to make these presentations more fun and engaging. And considering the bulk of our core supporters are located in the States, we had to look for a format that can be easily accessible for those people. The team liked that podcast can be accessible anywhere in the world, and it can be recorded anywhere. And podcasts can be quite entertaining and engaging more than conventional oral history audio recordings. Plus, a professional sound engineer / podcast producer recently joining our team gave all the reason for Yongsan Legacy to start a crowdfunding project for the Yongsan Legacy Podcast project.</p><p><strong>Who is John Nowell?</strong></p><p>Yongsan Legacy Podcast is a series of podcast of interviews and monologues by John Nowell. His connection with the U.S. Army Base Yongsan Garrison began in 1965 when he worked for the 7<sup>th</sup> Infrantry Division, 199 Personal Services Co. until he retired as the Public Affairs Officer of US Army Yongsan Garrison. He created special bonds and relationships within and outside the base with both Americans and Koreans.</p><p>He joined the team in April as our own Chief Communications Officer, and he’s been putting his skills and connections to good use. One of his skills that we haven’t fully realized until yet is his long standing expertise as a host and MC for events and broadcasting formats. He appeared on numerous TV programs and movies in Korea, and he also MC’ed many high profile events in Korea. His charming and witty character will be perfect for bringing out the best of each guest. </p><p><strong>Why should you back this project?</strong></p><p>This project will allow many people to come forward and share their own stories and memories about Yongsan Garrison. The team firmly believes that in order for people to remember and wanting to learn about Yongsan Garrison, the stories must be entertaining and fun. The writers and producers of the podcast will do their best to make each episode entertaining, educational, heart-warming and, most importantly, fact-checked. We have now over 10 terabytes of photos, maps, and stories about Yongsan Garrison; however, we feel that people’s voices and hand gestures cannot be captured in the data. The Yongsan Legacy Podcasts and Videos will be the best format to capture the stories and memories of those people who are still alive. With your help, we can start interview and produce professional quality podcasts and videos for the future generations.</p><p><strong>Our Plan and Commitment for The Podcast</strong></p><p>The team truly believes that Podcast will open new doors for people who would like to share their experiences and stories about Yongsan Garrison. We know this from hosting many different formats to efficiently archive and share people's stories since 2013. More importantly, we are trying to make sharing and archiving fun for the people who are interested in learning about Yongsan Garrison. We are committed to produce the best quality podcasts that will represent the diverse community of Yongsan Garrison.</p><p>By mid-September, the team will produce one or more pilot episodes to demonstrate how Yongsan Legacy Podcast can make military base history and people stories entertaining. </p><p>Once the campaign finishes in October, the team will start recording episodes as many episodes as the funding permits. Base on our estimate, it costs about $300 to produce an episode plus perks; that translates to about 10 episodes if our campaign is successful. </p><p><strong>What you get!</strong></p><p>$5 Thank You Note / Your name will be mentioned in Yongsan Legacy Podcast website with a personalized Thank You note from our producers.</p><p>$10 Social Media Shout-out / The producers will tag you in a personalized message on one of our Yongsan Legacy social media channels / Social Media Shout-out</p><p>$25 Your Name in the credits / Your name will be mentioned as a special thanks in the credits of a Yongsan Legacy episode! </p><p>$50 Early Download / Receive a pre-release download of Yongsan Legacy Podcast before anyone else!</p><p>$75 Magnet Bumper Sticker / High-quality Yongsan Legacy magnet bumper sticker that will not leave goo on your car /</p><p>$100 Yongsan Legacy T-shirt / Receive a custom-designed Yongsan Legacy T-shirt</p><p>$100 Yongsan Legacy Baseball Cap / Receive a custom-designed Yongsan Legacy Baseball Cap</p><p>$300 Short Story Corner/ Have your story related to Yongsan Garrison and Yongsan read during one of the episodes. And all the perks listed above.</p><p>$500 Guest on an Episode / Be a guest on an episode or designate a person whom you think Yongsan Legacy should interview as a part of Yongsan Legacy project. And all the perks listed above.</p><p>$1000 Episode Sponsor / Collaborate with the team to produce one of the episodes from choosing a topic to selecting background music of your choice. And all the perks listed above.</p><p>$2000 or more Platinum Sponsor / Put Yongsan Legacy Podcast on the road!

In order to make room for one of the largest urban parks in the world, the current master plan for Yongsan National Urban Park plans to demolish more than 90% of approximately 1,000 existing buildings inside the base. Once the buildings and places are removed, stories and memories of the place will also vanish into the past.Because it was an active military base, everything had to be kept secret. But after almost 70 years of Seoul’s rapid growth completely encapsulated the garrison making it an “urban archaeological site.” To many Seoulites, Yongsan Garrison is a “black hole” sitting in the middle of a megapolis. So naturally, mysteries and mostly stigma tend brew because there are so many things unknown. Many first time visitors inside the base are remarkably underwhelmed because the base doesn’t quite live up to their imaginations.Most people only see buildings built in various periods, and this is a part of a memory, but the buildings and the places are only empty shells once USFK move out of Yongsan Garrison. The project is interested in archiving the “soft memories”: human stories and interactions of people who spent time inside the base.Yongsan Legacy began because we found many layers of Korea that are locked up inside the base; Stories that are not buried by modern steel and glass developments or under luxury-branded coats and dresses of Koreans today. For outsiders, Yongsan Garrison offers an opportunity to see the remarkable progress that Koreans have made since the Japanese Colonial times, and for Korean nationals, the base provides a chance to pause and reflect on their past and appreciate the present day.The story of Yongsan Garrison does not stop at the boundaries of the base; its influence and connection reach well beyond the adjacent neighborhoods and the country. I wish people remember that there were people worked and lived on Yongsan Garrison. To me, people who passed through Yongsan Garrison over the last 70 years are the most precious assets of Yongsan Garrison. Since it is an American base, people will assume that I’m talking about 2.5 million Americans veterans who went through the base. But , in fact, about 60-70% of the people who work inside the base are Koreans and KATSUSA’s. And there were thousands of family members of the soldiers who spent time on the base doing shopping, going to church and going to school on the base. But the most people who benefited from those people are Koreans who lived in and around Yongsan Garrison and families and friends who are appreciative and naturally curious about this “beautiful country.”Why do we need Yongsan Legacy Podcast?Yongsan Legacy project is currently website-based community/crowd sourcing project. We have a fully customized website for the project linked to Facebook and Instagram designed specifically seek out those individuals who have served and lived on the base. From the beginning of the project, the team felt strongly about having offline meetings to better understand the community and individuals who support this project.We have conducted more than 100 personal interviews and organized 5 open-to-public lectures by individuals who wanted share their stories related to Yongsan Garrison. After having the five talks, it was clear that not many people were eager to stand in front of people. And the team wanted to make these presentations more fun and engaging. And considering the bulk of our core supporters are located in the States, we had to look for a format that can be easily accessible for those people. The team liked that podcast can be accessible anywhere in the world, and it can be recorded anywhere. And podcasts can be quite entertaining and engaging more than conventional oral history audio recordings. Plus, a professional sound engineer / podcast producer recently joining our team gave all the reason for Yongsan Legacy to start a crowdfunding project for the Yongsan Legacy Podcast project.Who is John Nowell?Yongsan Legacy Podcast is a series of podcast of interviews and monologues by John Nowell. His connection with the U.S. Army Base Yongsan Garrison began in 1965 when he worked for the 7th Infrantry Division, 199 Personal Services Co. until he retired as the Public Affairs Officer of US Army Yongsan Garrison. He created special bonds and relationships within and outside the base with both Americans and Koreans.He joined the team in April as our own Chief Communications Officer, and he’s been putting his skills and connections to good use. One of his skills that we haven’t fully realized until yet is his long standing expertise as a host and MC for events and broadcasting formats. He appeared on numerous TV programs and movies in Korea, and he also MC’ed many high profile events in Korea. His charming and witty character will be perfect for bringing out the best of each guest. Why should you back this project?This project will allow many people to come forward and share their own stories and memories about Yongsan Garrison. The team firmly believes that in order for people to remember and wanting to learn about Yongsan Garrison, the stories must be entertaining and fun. The writers and producers of the podcast will do their best to make each episode entertaining, educational, heart-warming and, most importantly, fact-checked. We have now over 10 terabytes of photos, maps, and stories about Yongsan Garrison; however, we feel that people’s voices and hand gestures cannot be captured in the data. The Yongsan Legacy Podcasts and Videos will be the best format to capture the stories and memories of those people who are still alive. With your help, we can start interview and produce professional quality podcasts and videos for the future generations.Our Plan and Commitment for The PodcastThe team truly believes that Podcast will open new doors for people who would like to share their experiences and stories about Yongsan Garrison. We know this from hosting many different formats to efficiently archive and share people's stories since 2013. More importantly, we are trying to make sharing and archiving fun for the people who are interested in learning about Yongsan Garrison. We are committed to produce the best quality podcasts that will represent the diverse community of Yongsan Garrison.By mid-September, the team will produce one or more pilot episodes to demonstrate how Yongsan Legacy Podcast can make military base history and people stories entertaining. Once the campaign finishes in October, the team will start recording episodes as many episodes as the funding permits. Base on our estimate, it costs about $300 to produce an episode plus perks; that translates to about 10 episodes if our campaign is successful. What you get!$5 Thank You Note / Your name will be mentioned in Yongsan Legacy Podcast website with a personalized Thank You note from our producers.$10 Social Media Shout-out / The producers will tag you in a personalized message on one of our Yongsan Legacy social media channels / Social Media Shout-out$25 Your Name in the credits / Your name will be mentioned as a special thanks in the credits of a Yongsan Legacy episode! $50 Early Download / Receive a pre-release download of Yongsan Legacy Podcast before anyone else!$75 Magnet Bumper Sticker / High-quality Yongsan Legacy magnet bumper sticker that will not leave goo on your car /$100 Yongsan Legacy T-shirt / Receive a custom-designed Yongsan Legacy T-shirt$100 Yongsan Legacy Baseball Cap / Receive a custom-designed Yongsan Legacy Baseball Cap$300 Short Story Corner/ Have your story related to Yongsan Garrison and Yongsan read during one of the episodes. And all the perks listed above.$500 Guest on an Episode / Be a guest on an episode or designate a person whom you think Yongsan Legacy should interview as a part of Yongsan Legacy project. And all the perks listed above.$1000 Episode Sponsor / Collaborate with the team to produce one of the episodes from choosing a topic to selecting background music of your choice. And all the perks listed above.$2000 or more Platinum Sponsor / Put Yongsan Legacy Podcast on the road!

<h3>Infringement</h3>
<p>The Infringement Festival is a vital part of Buffalo's art culture, and a summer tradition that's been going strong for 14 years. We have acts that cover theater, music, art, dance, spoken word, film, and even some artists that defy genre categorizations altogether.  All proceeds---cover charges, pass-the-hat donations---go directly to the artists, with the bare minimum set aside to cover technical expenses. We need your financial help to produce the festival program and cover technical expenses.</p>
<p>Can you support us in this endeavor? You'll be able to say that you directly support the arts in Buffalo.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We publish a large insert in the Public, one of the local ""alternative"" weeklies, as well as ads in other publications. We also rent PA and stage gear for a limited number of venues.</p>
<ul>
<li>We still need about $2000, on top of what we've raised through fundraiser concerts.</li>
<li>We offer festival t-shirts and stickers/decals as rewards for funding us.</li>
<li>Every little bit counts. We've never fallen short, and with your help, 2017 will be no different.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>We are the largest (but not the only) festival of our kind. Although the original Infringement Festival was started and is still run in Montreal, QC by one of the original founders, Buffalo's festival is the only one that has expanded to 11 days and 400+ artists.</p>
<p>Your donation supports artists. It allows for works to be presented both in interesting, unique spaces and by artists who do not normally get a lot of exposure. We cover a range of aesthetics, experience-levels, and we allow artists to get out of their comfort zones and present original, new, and challenging work.</p>
<p>Your donation also supports audiences. Without the people who come out to shows, this festival would not continue to exist.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is always the risk of a budgetary shortfall, or that some venue will suddenly close. Our organizer committee is our biggest strength. Collectively, we have 100+ years of experience making this thing a reality. We are also constantly bringing in new people to help us figure out how to make things happen.</p>

<h3>History Chip's Story</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">My name is Jean McGavin, the founder of History Chip. My story spans my life as a mother, a business owner, artist and historian. Bolstering my own story is a childhood love of the wonder and exoticism available to each of us from the hearing of a simple story. </span></p>
<p>So, I built History Chip to provide the wonderful stories of ordinary folks in a fully searchable platform. History Chip's mission is to include everyone's stories into the history of our world - the stories of farmers, and nomads and immigrants and people in developing countries. Stories about women and minorities and garbage collectors and seamstresses and commuters - everyone’s stories - and to make them integral parts of our history. This is not simply to be inclusive but most importantly to make our history more truthful and more wonderful. Without the stories of huge swaths of people, you just don’t have a complete truth. If our history leaves out the stories of women or men or people of color or Catholics or Australians or Chileans, the story is just not complete.</p>
<p>In short, by contributing to our campaign, you are helping to <i>rewrite history</i>. You are helping to expand history to include the stories of the 99% of us whose stories aren’t in history books. This is only possible now because of the internet. History Chip is vital to having a full understanding of our place in a larger world, how what we do impacts others, how a changing climate affects peoples’ lives, how we can demystify differences amongst us. History Chip is inclusive, broadens our understanding of the truth and welcomes the wonderful stories of everyone.</p>

<h3>Siri makes a break to take up some space.</h3>
<p>  Hello, I am an interior designer with experience creating private gathering spaces where people feel taken care of and at ease.  Recently I have worked on several public spaces which have really piqued my interest - The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, a boutique brow salon, women's clothing boutiques, and a non-profit pediatric dental clinic. These public space projects have opened my imagination to how I might create a public gathering space for others to use.  </p>
<p>I am looking to create a place where others can host, share ideas and connect.  There are many public spaces available to gather in, but they lack the warmth and thoughtful care that I want in a gathering space.  Maybe you agree, you feel that this idea could really add to the community and culture of the Twin Cities.  Maybe you’d like to gather in a casual, safe warm environment that was designed intelligently and intentionally for the purpose of bringing people together and making them feel special. If so, I am asking you to help me with the initial capital for such a space.  I do not have the resources to invest the capital to get this project off the ground, but with your help I am confident that we can make it happen and I can keep it going into the future. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What I am looking for is the capital to cover the startup costs for the first 1-3 years of this project while I create the space, spread the word and organize the logistics of running a viable business. Your participation in supporting this project means that you get to use the space first when it is ready! In the first year of this project, I'll host a few (free) friends + family events. Additionally, I will organize and host several ticketed events. This first year will be my time to get the word out, to get people in the door and show off the charm and flexibility of the space.  I will use this time to inspire in others, ideas about the many ways this space can be used in for community or private events they may like to host themselves. </p>
<p>Your participation will translate directly toward ticketed events.  For example, if you donate $25, you'll receive a $25 gift certificate toward a ticketed event.  If you donate thousands of dollars, we'll host your private event(s) for you (see ""perks"" for details).</p>
<p>Here are the major expenses that I am looking to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buildout of the kitchen and outdoor area- lighting, appliances, pizza oven, sound absorption, fixtures and working surfaces ~18K</li>
<li>Modular furniture for 49 guests (tables, seating, etc.) ~8K</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>This project represents a chance to make a different kind of gathering place. A place for you and your community to eat, discuss, to read, to create, and celebrate together.  There are so many talented interesting people in this community who I would love to connect and bring together in a more thoughtful way- book clubs, art shows, dinners, ...This is a space for people throughout the Twin Cities to gather in, to connect over a common interest or idea.</li>
<li>This project is about the intersection of hospitality and space, a project I am uniquely suited for. I have eight years of experience working as an interior designer as well as 5 years of previous experience planning both private and public events. The skills I've cultivated situate me as the right person to make this happen.</li>
<li>The closer I get to my fundraising goal the more I am freed up to create an optimal space -rather than something that is simply good enough.   The success of this project really depends on making this space function seamlessly for others, and to my standards.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am prepared to undertake this because it is a natural confluence of many of the things that I am interested in and the skills that I have cultivated over the last two decades. It is something we do not have in our community and that I can do well.</li>
<li>The biggest challenge to this project is really the startup money. I am prepared to pursue this whether I reach my full goal or not. In that case I will continue to pursue ways to cover the expenses, but your support makes it possible for me to focus on doing this project right. Your support allows me to make the use of the space focused on community first rather than focusing on covering the space's expenses.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul><li>If this idea excites you please tell your friends, family and community about it.  Please join in spreading the word.  Thank you!</li></ul>

This project is about the intersection of hospitality and space, a project I am uniquely suited for. I have eight years of experience working as an interior designer as well as 5 years of previous experience planning both private and public events. The skills I've cultivated situate me as the right person to make this happen.
The closer I get to my fundraising goal the more I am freed up to create an optimal space -rather than something that is simply good enough.   The success of this project really depends on making this space function seamlessly for others, and to my standards.


Risks & Challenges

I am prepared to undertake this because it is a natural confluence of many of the things that I am interested in and the skills that I have cultivated over the last two decades. It is something we do not have in our community and that I can do well.
The biggest challenge to this project is really the startup money. I am prepared to pursue this whether I reach my full goal or not. In that case I will continue to pursue ways to cover the expenses, but your support makes it possible for me to focus on doing this project right. Your support allows me to make the use of the space focused on community first rather than focusing on covering the space's expenses.

<h1>TheWaysBeyond 2.0</h1>
<p><br/><i><strong>&gt;&gt;Version en français en bas de page&lt;&lt;</strong></i></p>
<p><br/><strong>No matter who you are or where you are from, Culture connects us all.  Whichever boundary life might bring onto our paths, Culture remains a place for exchange and dialogue.</strong><br/>For centuries French creation and art-de-vivre have been radiating and influencing the entire world. Today whether with ancestral practices or cutting-edge technology the <i>French Touch</i> perpetuates the tradition of Excellence in the works of women and men dedicated to their passion. <strong>TheWaysBeyond was born out of the idea of exploring the backstage of French creation and give you a closer look at it during unique experiences based on <i>Excellence</i> and <i>Exchange</i></strong>.</p>
<p>After one year of selecting and organizing activities for individuals, we decided to launch the first <i><strong>Cultural Learning Expeditions</strong></i><strong> based in Paris </strong>– an upgraded version of our service that goes deeper into the discovery of culture and creativity.  <strong>This future flagship product is open to corporates, institutions and groups of individuals</strong>, to bring positive impact and inspiration to a broader public.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The First <i>Cultural Learning Expeditions</i> based in Paris</h2>
<p>With <i>Cultural Learning Expeditions</i> you get out of your usual routine and enter the unexpected through meeting, exchange and experience. It is a moment to learn from creative minds, from your friends or your team members and also from yourselves.<br/> </p>
<h3>Positivity &amp; Fulfilment: 2 Birds, 1 Stone</h3>
<p>By engaging in Culture and Heritage, companies play an essential role in society. Today, facing the increasing phenomenon of ""burn-out"" or ""bore-out"", many though are striving to give back meaning to their employees. While some have already understood that <strong>Art and Culture can be the surprising element that energizes and inspires their teams</strong>. With TheWaysBeyond, you can bring back positivity and fulfilment to your organizations and revitalize your staff with the inherent strength of Art and Culture.</p>
<p>From a refreshing way of celebrating to a team-building, a 1-day city break or a 7-day journey, our ​<i>Cultural Learning Expeditions</i> are both a creative retreat and an open-air school, as <strong>we focus on the valuable role Culture can play to surprise, reward and inspire</strong>.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567007446/xzvcaglzitce6bb8isnl.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What We Have Achieved In One Year</h2>
<p>Since we launched TheWaysBeyond 12 months ago, our efforts have started to bear fruits: </p>
<ul>
<li>We have <strong>tested numerous activities in order to select the best, and organize punctual events</strong> for individuals and private groups;</li>
<li>Many agencies, platforms, cultural institutions, artists, designers and foundations came to us to <strong>integrate our network</strong>;</li>
<li>
<strong>German publisher Travel Colours contacted us to curate their Paris <i>City Guide for Design Lovers</i></strong>, presenting the newest generation of Parisian hospitality;</li>
<li>We were <strong>invited to the National Assembly</strong> to discuss entrepreneurship in Culture with Parisian deputies, and to the <strong>Sorbonne University</strong> to exchange with Master students in Tourism.<br/> </li>
</ul>
<p>All the support and confirmation have only convinced us even more of the meaning and the importance of what we are doing.  Yet, like many other young companies, TheWaysBeyond is still not profitable and this is where you can help. Because <strong>with your help, we can ride on the wave and definitely spread Culture towards a larger public!</strong><br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569446935/eamapeouxkqo4obukjlq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What More Could Be Said About Paris?</h2>
<p>Paris is the most visited city in the world. It is so striking, yet at the same time so invisible. But as <strong>we were both born and bred in different countries</strong>, we are still discovering Paris with the eyes of <i>outsiders</i>. With TheWaysBeyond, you will confront yourself to French culture from the inside, but also from the outside! Especially as for us, Paris is not only about luxury or romanticism – <strong>what we want to show you goes beyond the <i>clichés</i>; it is about the people, the heritage, the future and the things we all seem to know, but sometimes tend to forget.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>Did you know for example that a member of the Rothschild family created a foundation in the early 20th cent. that is still active today to support young French artists?</li>
<li>Did you know that young craftsmen were bringing back to life old French brands that have been asleep for centuries?</li>
<li>Or have you ever imagined there could be a flower farm at the very heart of Paris and even an urban farm along the Champs Élysées?<br/> </li>
</ul>
<p>These are but a few questions we want to answer for you, <strong>to show you history in the making, with passionate people and everlasting creative energy</strong>.<br/> </p>

<h2>TheWaysBeyond - A Project From Our Hearts</h2>
<p>TheWaysBeyond is the story of Nikki and Frederic.  Nikki and Frederic met in Paris years after their arrival in the City of Lights.  She is from Beijing and has always worked in Finance and in the private sector; he is from Belgium and has worked for several cultural institutions – nothing at first seemed to bring them closer together, except for love, their attachment to Paris and their endless curiosity for culture and humanity.</p>
<p>(And now this is the part where you can laugh at us feeling awkward for our first ""official portrait"" in our apartment…)</p>

<p><i><strong>&gt;&gt;VERSION FRANÇAISE&lt;&lt;</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Peu importe qui vous êtes ou d'où vous venez, la culture nous relie tous. Quels que soient les obstacles que la vie nous réserve, la culture reste un lieu d’échange et de dialogue.</strong><br/>Depuis des siècles, la création et l’art de vivre français n’ont cessé de rayonner et d’influencer le monde entier. Aujourd’hui encore, qu’elle répète des gestes ancestraux ou les fasse évoluer avec des technologies de pointe, la <i>French Touch</i> perpétue les traditions d’excellences dans le travail de femmes et d’hommes dédiés à leur passion. <strong>TheWaysBeyond est né de l’envie d’explorer les coulisses de la création française et de vous la faire découvrir au cours d’expériences uniques placées sous les sceaux de l’Excellence et de l’Échange</strong>.<br/>Après un an de tests et d’organisation d’activités pour particuliers, nous avons décidé de lancer les premières <strong><i>Cultural Learning Expeditions</i> basées à Paris</strong> (""expéditions d'apprentissage culturel"") – une nouvelle version de notre service qui va plus loin encore dans la découverte de la culture et de la créativité. <strong>Ce futur produit phare de TheWaysBeyond est ouvert aux entreprises, aux institutions et aux groupes de particuliers</strong>, afin de surprendre et d’inspirer un public encore plus large !<br/> </p>
<p><u><strong>LES PREMIERES <i>CULTURAL LEARNING EXPEDITIONS</i> BASÉES A PARIS</strong></u></p>
<p>Avec les <i>Cultural Learning Expeditions</i>, vous sortez de votre routine habituelle et découvrez l’inattendu au travers de rencontres, des échanges et des expériences. C'est un moment pour apprendre au contact d’esprits créatifs, de vos amis ou des membres de votre équipe et aussi surtout, de vous-mêmes.</p>
<p><strong>Positivité &amp; Épanouissement : faire d’une pierre deux coups</strong></p>
<p>En s’engageant dans la Culture et le Patrimoine, les sociétés jouent un rôle essentiel dans la société. Aujourd’hui cependant, face aux phénomènes de <i>burn-out</i> et de <i>bore-out</i> (l’épuisement par la surcharge de travail ou par l’ennui au travail), beaucoup d’entre elles cherchent à rendre un sens au travail de leurs employés. Alors que certaines ont déjà compris que <strong>l’Art et la Culture peuvent jouer le rôle d’éléments de surprise qui redynamisent et inspirent leurs équipes</strong>. Avec TheWaysBeyond, vous pouvez aider votre organisation à retrouver positivité et épanouissement à travers le pouvoir inhérent à l’Art et à la Culture.</p>
<p>D’un apéro culturel à un team building, en passant par un city break d’une journée ou un voyage d’une semaine, nos <i>Cultural Learning Expeditions</i> sont à la fois une retraite créative et une école en plein air, car <strong>nous nous concentrons sur le rôle précieux que la culture peut jouer pour surprendre, récompenser et inspirer</strong>.<br/> </p>
<p><u><strong>UN AN DE THEWAYSBEYOND</strong></u></p>
<p>Depuis le lancement de TheWaysBeyond il y a 1 an, nos efforts ont commencé à porter leurs fruits :</p>
<ul>
<li>Nous avons <strong>testé de nombreuses activités afin d'en sélectionner les meilleures, et d'organiser des événements ponctuels</strong> pour des groupes de particuliers ;</li>
<li>De nombreuses agences, plateformes, institutions culturelles, artistes, designers et fondations nous ont contactés pour <strong>intégrer nos réseaux</strong> ;</li>
<li>
<strong>L'éditeur allemand Travel Colours nous a contacté pour curater l'édition parisienne de leur City Guide pour amateurs de design</strong>, présentant l'avant-garde de l'hospitalité parisienne ;</li>
<li>Nous avons été <strong>invités à l’Assemblée nationale</strong> pour discuter de l’entreprenariat dans la Culture, ainsi qu’<strong>à la Sorbonne</strong> pour échanger avec des étudiants en Master en Tourisme.<br/> </li>
</ul>
<p>Ces soutiens et confirmations nous ont convaincus du sens et de l’importance de notre projet. Et pourtant, comme beaucoup de jeunes entreprises, TheWaysBeyond n’est pas encore rentable et c’est ici que vous pouvez nous aider. Car <strong>avec votre soutien, nous pouvons profiter du vent qui nous porte et réellement diffuser la Culture auprès d’un public plus large encore</strong> !<br/> </p>
<p><u><strong>QUE DIRE DE PLUS SUR PARIS ?</strong></u></p>
<p>Paris est en effet la ville la plus visitée au monde. De toutes les villes, elle est, comme le disait Cocteau, « la plus voyante et la plus invisible ». Mais <strong>nous sommes tous les deux nés et avons grandi dans des pays étrangers</strong>, et sommes donc constamment en train de découvrir la ville avec un regard nouveau  ! Aussi, avec TheWaysBeyond, vous vous confrontez à la culture française avec le regard d’un habitant, mais aussi d’un nouvel habitant ! D'autant plus que pour nous, Paris ne se résume pas au luxe et au romantisme. Ce que <strong>nous voulons vous montrer, c’est ce qui va par-delà les clichés – cette énergie invisible qui pousse constamment la ville à aller de l’avant.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Saviez-vous par exemple qu’un un membre de la famille Rothschild avait créé une fondation au début du XXe siècle, et qui existe aujourd’hui encore soutient et promeut de jeunes artistes français ?</li>
<li>Saviez-vous que de jeunes artisans ressuscitent aujourd’hui d'anciennes marques françaises endormies depuis des siècles ?</li>
<li>Ou encore, aviez-vous imaginé qu’il puisse exister des fermes floricoles en plein Paris, voire même une ferme urbaine le long des Champs Élysées ?<br/>​</li>
</ul>
<p>Quelques questions parmi tant d’autres, auxquelles nous vous proposons de répondre pour <strong>vous montrer l’histoire en mouvement, faite par des personnes passionnées et leur inépuisable énergie créatrice</strong> !<br/> </p>
<p><u><strong>POURQUOI NOUS AVONS BESOIN DE VOUS ?</strong></u></p>
<p>Après une année d’essais d’activités, nous souhaiterions récolter <strong>12.600€</strong> pour lancer TheWaysBeyond 2.0, une version étendue de notre offre actuelle. <strong>Votre contribution est essentielle pour nous permettre d'élargir notre portfolio, de proposer de nouvelles expériences encore plus authentiques, et de convaincre plus d'entreprises et d'institutions.</strong><br/>Ces 12.600€ seront répartis comme suit :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>4000€ / Développement de l'offre</strong> : Nous allons creuser les rues de Paris et au-delà  (à ± 2h de trajet de Paris) pour y chercher de nouveaux trésors cachés et vous proposer le meilleur de ce que le territoire a à offrir.</li>
<li>
<strong>4000€ / Développement de la clientèle</strong> : Marketing, foires et expositions internationales ;</li>
<li>
<strong>4000€ / Amélioration du site web</strong> : Optimisation du système de réservation ; S.E.O. compliance…</li>
<li><strong>600€ / Frais Indiegogo</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Ces objectifs, c’est grâce à VOUS, chers amis, que nous pourrons les atteindre !<br/> </p>
<p><u><strong>CE QUE NOUS VOUS OFFRONS EN RETOUR</strong></u></p>

>>Version en français en bas de page<<
No matter who you are or where you are from, Culture connects us all.  Whichever boundary life might bring onto our paths, Culture remains a place for exchange and dialogue.For centuries French creation and art-de-vivre have been radiating and influencing the entire world. Today whether with ancestral practices or cutting-edge technology the French Touch perpetuates the tradition of Excellence in the works of women and men dedicated to their passion. TheWaysBeyond was born out of the idea of exploring the backstage of French creation and give you a closer look at it during unique experiences based on Excellence and Exchange.
After one year of selecting and organizing activities for individuals, we decided to launch the first Cultural Learning Expeditions based in Paris – an upgraded version of our service that goes deeper into the discovery of culture and creativity.  This future flagship product is open to corporates, institutions and groups of individuals, to bring positive impact and inspiration to a broader public.
 
The First Cultural Learning Expeditions based in Paris
With Cultural Learning Expeditions you get out of your usual routine and enter the unexpected through meeting, exchange and experience. It is a moment to learn from creative minds, from your friends or your team members and also from yourselves. 
Positivity & Fulfilment: 2 Birds, 1 Stone
By engaging in Culture and Heritage, companies play an essential role in society. Today, facing the increasing phenomenon of ""burn-out"" or ""bore-out"", many though are striving to give back meaning to their employees. While some have already understood that Art and Culture can be the surprising element that energizes and inspires their teams. With TheWaysBeyond, you can bring back positivity and fulfilment to your organizations and revitalize your staff with the inherent strength of Art and Culture.
From a refreshing way of celebrating to a team-building, a 1-day city break or a 7-day journey, our ​Cultural Learning Expeditions are both a creative retreat and an open-air school, as we focus on the valuable role Culture can play to surprise, reward and inspire.
 
What We Have Achieved In One Year
Since we launched TheWaysBeyond 12 months ago, our efforts have started to bear fruits: 

We have tested numerous activities in order to select the best, and organize punctual events for individuals and private groups;
Many agencies, platforms, cultural institutions, artists, designers and foundations came to us to integrate our network;

German publisher Travel Colours contacted us to curate their Paris City Guide for Design Lovers, presenting the newest generation of Parisian hospitality;
We were invited to the National Assembly to discuss entrepreneurship in Culture with Parisian deputies, and to the Sorbonne University to exchange with Master students in Tourism. 

All the support and confirmation have only convinced us even more of the meaning and the importance of what we are doing.  Yet, like many other young companies, TheWaysBeyond is still not profitable and this is where you can help. Because with your help, we can ride on the wave and definitely spread Culture towards a larger public! 

 
What More Could Be Said About Paris?
Paris is the most visited city in the world. It is so striking, yet at the same time so invisible. But as we were both born and bred in different countries, we are still discovering Paris with the eyes of outsiders. With TheWaysBeyond, you will confront yourself to French culture from the inside, but also from the outside! Especially as for us, Paris is not only about luxury or romanticism – what we want to show you goes beyond the clichés; it is about the people, the heritage, the future and the things we all seem to know, but sometimes tend to forget.


Did you know for example that a member of the Rothschild family created a foundation in the early 20th cent. that is still active today to support young French artists?
Did you know that young craftsmen were bringing back to life old French brands that have been asleep for centuries?
Or have you ever imagined there could be a flower farm at the very heart of Paris and even an urban farm along the Champs Élysées? 

These are but a few questions we want to answer for you, to show you history in the making, with passionate people and everlasting creative energy.

TheWaysBeyond - A Project From Our Hearts
TheWaysBeyond is the story of Nikki and Frederic.  Nikki and Frederic met in Paris years after their arrival in the City of Lights.  She is from Beijing and has always worked in Finance and in the private sector; he is from Belgium and has worked for several cultural institutions – nothing at first seemed to bring them closer together, except for love, their attachment to Paris and their endless curiosity for culture and humanity.
(And now this is the part where you can laugh at us feeling awkward for our first ""official portrait"" in our apartment…)

>>VERSION FRANÇAISE<<
 
Peu importe qui vous êtes ou d'où vous venez, la culture nous relie tous. Quels que soient les obstacles que la vie nous réserve, la culture reste un lieu d’échange et de dialogue.Depuis des siècles, la création et l’art de vivre français n’ont cessé de rayonner et d’influencer le monde entier. Aujourd’hui encore, qu’elle répète des gestes ancestraux ou les fasse évoluer avec des technologies de pointe, la French Touch perpétue les traditions d’excellences dans le travail de femmes et d’hommes dédiés à leur passion. TheWaysBeyond est né de l’envie d’explorer les coulisses de la création française et de vous la faire découvrir au cours d’expériences uniques placées sous les sceaux de l’Excellence et de l’Échange.Après un an de tests et d’organisation d’activités pour particuliers, nous avons décidé de lancer les premières Cultural Learning Expeditions basées à Paris (""expéditions d'apprentissage culturel"") – une nouvelle version de notre service qui va plus loin encore dans la découverte de la culture et de la créativité. Ce futur produit phare de TheWaysBeyond est ouvert aux entreprises, aux institutions et aux groupes de particuliers, afin de surprendre et d’inspirer un public encore plus large ! 
LES PREMIERES CULTURAL LEARNING EXPEDITIONS BASÉES A PARIS
Avec les Cultural Learning Expeditions, vous sortez de votre routine habituelle et découvrez l’inattendu au travers de rencontres, des échanges et des expériences. C'est un moment pour apprendre au contact d’esprits créatifs, de vos amis ou des membres de votre équipe et aussi surtout, de vous-mêmes.
Positivité & Épanouissement : faire d’une pierre deux coups
En s’engageant dans la Culture et le Patrimoine, les sociétés jouent un rôle essentiel dans la société. Aujourd’hui cependant, face aux phénomènes de burn-out et de bore-out (l’épuisement par la surcharge de travail ou par l’ennui au travail), beaucoup d’entre elles cherchent à rendre un sens au travail de leurs employés. Alors que certaines ont déjà compris que l’Art et la Culture peuvent jouer le rôle d’éléments de surprise qui redynamisent et inspirent leurs équipes. Avec TheWaysBeyond, vous pouvez aider votre organisation à retrouver positivité et épanouissement à travers le pouvoir inhérent à l’Art et à la Culture.
D’un apéro culturel à un team building, en passant par un city break d’une journée ou un voyage d’une semaine, nos Cultural Learning Expeditions sont à la fois une retraite créative et une école en plein air, car nous nous concentrons sur le rôle précieux que la culture peut jouer pour surprendre, récompenser et inspirer. 
UN AN DE THEWAYSBEYOND
Depuis le lancement de TheWaysBeyond il y a 1 an, nos efforts ont commencé à porter leurs fruits :

Nous avons testé de nombreuses activités afin d'en sélectionner les meilleures, et d'organiser des événements ponctuels pour des groupes de particuliers ;
De nombreuses agences, plateformes, institutions culturelles, artistes, designers et fondations nous ont contactés pour intégrer nos réseaux ;

L'éditeur allemand Travel Colours nous a contacté pour curater l'édition parisienne de leur City Guide pour amateurs de design, présentant l'avant-garde de l'hospitalité parisienne ;
Nous avons été invités à l’Assemblée nationale pour discuter de l’entreprenariat dans la Culture, ainsi qu’à la Sorbonne pour échanger avec des étudiants en Master en Tourisme. 

Ces soutiens et confirmations nous ont convaincus du sens et de l’importance de notre projet. Et pourtant, comme beaucoup de jeunes entreprises, TheWaysBeyond n’est pas encore rentable et c’est ici que vous pouvez nous aider. Car avec votre soutien, nous pouvons profiter du vent qui nous porte et réellement diffuser la Culture auprès d’un public plus large encore ! 
QUE DIRE DE PLUS SUR PARIS ?
Paris est en effet la ville la plus visitée au monde. De toutes les villes, elle est, comme le disait Cocteau, « la plus voyante et la plus invisible ». Mais nous sommes tous les deux nés et avons grandi dans des pays étrangers, et sommes donc constamment en train de découvrir la ville avec un regard nouveau  ! Aussi, avec TheWaysBeyond, vous vous confrontez à la culture française avec le regard d’un habitant, mais aussi d’un nouvel habitant ! D'autant plus que pour nous, Paris ne se résume pas au luxe et au romantisme. Ce que nous voulons vous montrer, c’est ce qui va par-delà les clichés – cette énergie invisible qui pousse constamment la ville à aller de l’avant.

Saviez-vous par exemple qu’un un membre de la famille Rothschild avait créé une fondation au début du XXe siècle, et qui existe aujourd’hui encore soutient et promeut de jeunes artistes français ?
Saviez-vous que de jeunes artisans ressuscitent aujourd’hui d'anciennes marques françaises endormies depuis des siècles ?
Ou encore, aviez-vous imaginé qu’il puisse exister des fermes floricoles en plein Paris, voire même une ferme urbaine le long des Champs Élysées ?​

Quelques questions parmi tant d’autres, auxquelles nous vous proposons de répondre pour vous montrer l’histoire en mouvement, faite par des personnes passionnées et leur inépuisable énergie créatrice ! 
POURQUOI NOUS AVONS BESOIN DE VOUS ?
Après une année d’essais d’activités, nous souhaiterions récolter 12.600€ pour lancer TheWaysBeyond 2.0, une version étendue de notre offre actuelle. Votre contribution est essentielle pour nous permettre d'élargir notre portfolio, de proposer de nouvelles expériences encore plus authentiques, et de convaincre plus d'entreprises et d'institutions.Ces 12.600€ seront répartis comme suit :


4000€ / Développement de l'offre : Nous allons creuser les rues de Paris et au-delà  (à ± 2h de trajet de Paris) pour y chercher de nouveaux trésors cachés et vous proposer le meilleur de ce que le territoire a à offrir.

4000€ / Développement de la clientèle : Marketing, foires et expositions internationales ;

4000€ / Amélioration du site web : Optimisation du système de réservation ; S.E.O. compliance…

THEWAYSBEYOND – UN PROJET QUI NOUS TIENT A CŒUR
TheWaysBeyond, c’est l’histoire de Nikki et Frederic. Nous nous sommes rencontrés à Paris, quelques années après notre arrivée dans la Ville lumière. Nikki vient de Pékin et a toujours travaillé dans la Finance et le secteur privé ; et Frederic vient de Bruxelles, où il a évolué dans diverses institutions culturelles – rien, a priori, ne semblait nous rapprocher, si ce n’est un coup de foudre, notre attachement commun pour Paris et notre curiosité sans fin pour la culture et l’humain.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Help Kids Live a Positive Life</u></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">“OcYM globally inspires confidence, optimism, creativity, and peace through words, arts, and fashion to enhance a positive mindset towards life.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">-Stress Less, Embrace More</p>
<ul><li><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Overcome Your Mental (OcYM) was founded in January of 2020 by <a href=""https://youtu.be/hSZaZ6X34eY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">E. Victor Nickerson</a>. He is the first male in his family to receive a college degree and even continued to get his Master's Degree from Valparaiso University. The inspiration behind OcYM is the belief in a positive mentality strong enough to embrace any situation, no matter how stressful it may seem to be. We believe there is at least one positive in every experience. The key is finding the positives and focusing on them.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">With the help of Nicola Scepanovic, an idea and plan were developed to help better the youth. Mr. Scepanovic, who is a basketball enthusiast and the manager of OcYM Basketball, has family throughout Europe. He has always wanted to help people in any way possible. Nicola's family also loves to give back and are interested in sports, especially basketball. His family was more than willing to help set up this great opportunity for the youth kids when they heard about the project. Continue reading for more details about the OcYM youth project.</p>

<ul><li><strong>DREAMS AND EDUCATION</strong></li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Overcome Your Mental (OcYM) is creating the <strong>""OcYM Youth Culture Cup (OYCC)""</strong> for American youth basketball teams. This is an opportunity for players to showcase their skills against European club teams internationally. The OYCC will have a tournament style format. Players will have a chance to learn about the European culture and see what life really is like in other places of the world. Some of these children have never left the country and may never get another chance. OcYM believes providing early opportunities like the OYCC can help keep our youth motivated to stay on a positive pathway to achieve greatness in life. We are huge believers in creating the opportunities for others that we wish we had. It is an amazing way to show our gratitude and how much we truly care for younger generations.</p>
<ul><li><strong>THE YOUTH NEEDS YOU</strong></li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Get in the game and join us to create a special moment for these players. Your contribution is one play closer to inspiring kids to embrace their dreams, while <strong>enhancing their knowledge</strong> of the world through basketball. Help us create a better start to life for the next generation. Together anything is possible! </p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">As of now, we have 3 teams from America who are excited about the project and want to participate. These youth teams are located in Georgia (2) and Tennessee (1). One of the teams from Georgia, ""<a href=""https://www.thewilsonacademy.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Wilson Academy</a>"", has already committed to participating. The cost per team is $16,000 to be able to enjoy a <strong>unique culture experience</strong> and play the game these kids love, in a country that they have never been to. After covering the event expenses, we will use the rest of the money to complete the project stretch goals and to help teams cover their expenses. This will be very beneficial for families especially if a family is not is the best economic situation. Since these kids have no sponsor, we invite you to join us to be their sponsor. <strong>You are the key for future success</strong>.</p>

“OcYM globally inspires confidence, optimism, creativity, and peace through words, arts, and fashion to enhance a positive mindset towards life.”
-Stress Less, Embrace More
BACKGROUND
Overcome Your Mental (OcYM) was founded in January of 2020 by E. Victor Nickerson. He is the first male in his family to receive a college degree and even continued to get his Master's Degree from Valparaiso University. The inspiration behind OcYM is the belief in a positive mentality strong enough to embrace any situation, no matter how stressful it may seem to be. We believe there is at least one positive in every experience. The key is finding the positives and focusing on them.
With the help of Nicola Scepanovic, an idea and plan were developed to help better the youth. Mr. Scepanovic, who is a basketball enthusiast and the manager of OcYM Basketball, has family throughout Europe. He has always wanted to help people in any way possible. Nicola's family also loves to give back and are interested in sports, especially basketball. His family was more than willing to help set up this great opportunity for the youth kids when they heard about the project. Continue reading for more details about the OcYM youth project.

DREAMS AND EDUCATION
Overcome Your Mental (OcYM) is creating the ""OcYM Youth Culture Cup (OYCC)"" for American youth basketball teams. This is an opportunity for players to showcase their skills against European club teams internationally. The OYCC will have a tournament style format. Players will have a chance to learn about the European culture and see what life really is like in other places of the world. Some of these children have never left the country and may never get another chance. OcYM believes providing early opportunities like the OYCC can help keep our youth motivated to stay on a positive pathway to achieve greatness in life. We are huge believers in creating the opportunities for others that we wish we had. It is an amazing way to show our gratitude and how much we truly care for younger generations.
THE YOUTH NEEDS YOU
Get in the game and join us to create a special moment for these players. Your contribution is one play closer to inspiring kids to embrace their dreams, while enhancing their knowledge of the world through basketball. Help us create a better start to life for the next generation. Together anything is possible!

CONTRIBUTION AND PROJECT DETAILS
 
FUNDING FOR A BETTER FUTURE
Our ultimate goal with ""OcYM Youth Culture Cup (OYCC)"" is creating an annual opportunity for kids to be able to enjoy what they love to do and embrace different cultures in person. We believe this is an amazing way for kids to have a ""hands-on"" educational experience and help improve their appreciation for life. With your contributions together we will be able to give these kids an experience of a life time.

As of now, we have 3 teams from America who are excited about the project and want to participate. These youth teams are located in Georgia (2) and Tennessee (1). One of the teams from Georgia, ""The Wilson Academy"", has already committed to participating. The cost per team is $16,000 to be able to enjoy a unique culture experience and play the game these kids love, in a country that they have never been to. After covering the event expenses, we will use the rest of the money to complete the project stretch goals and to help teams cover their expenses. This will be very beneficial for families especially if a family is not is the best economic situation. Since these kids have no sponsor, we invite you to join us to be their sponsor. You are the key for future success.

BE THE CHANGE
 
HELP LEAD OUR YOUTH
""Support Kids: Dreams and Education with OcYM"" can inspire our youth generation which will impact the direction of their mindset in society. We want to help educate our youth with real life experiences. Sometimes these kinds of experiences are the best tools for education. Creating these positive opportunities for our youth culture can help bring positive changes and experiences to the world. Some of these kids have always dreamed of a chance to see life outside of their own environment. This is a great opportunity to contribute as some may never get another chance to explore another country. We love for you to help us bridge the culture gap and give these kids an opportunity not only to play the sport they love but also to embrace amazing cultures.

Now that we have more experience in life, I am sure that we all had that moment when we wished we could have did something but just was not able to. Maybe even had a chance to do something and just wished we could do it once more. This is an once in a lifetime opportunity to be able to be learn about a different culture in person. Help us create ""OcYM Youth Culture Cup (OYCC)"", the event will be held in Montenegro. A life changing experience that will never be forgotten. These are the opportunities for our youth that can help them truly appreciate life and will inspire them to be great and do great. 
Everyone can talk but it is time we take the next step. Let us think beyond ourselves and give these kids a reason to live positively. Together, we will motivate them to give back when it. The youth needs us to lead, not just talk and watch them.
Overcome Your Mental (OcYM) wants to lead with you.
LEAD on 3 -  1..2..3... LEAD!!

What’s the real risk? The risk is witnessing a national and global community that doesn’t value meaningful connections between people of all walks of life; it is in observing a larger community that doesn’t feel the elemental pull of fire and the sense of adventurous spirit brought out in wild places; The risk is exposing ourselves, our values, and philosophies and finding that the world simply doesn’t resonate.  </p><p>Aside from these risks, we don’t fear the obstacles that have yet to come.  We have a highly motivated team, and one with a myriad of experiences culminating into a what one friend quoted as “The Perfect Storm.”  It is in this perfect storm that we’ll sharpen our focus, pivot as needed, and continue to espouse the values we stand for: Inclusivity, adventure, learning, sharing, co-creating, giving back, and caring for each other and the planet.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541715589/i7fjunfget9vzogjncch.png"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><h3>THE IMPACT</h3><p>Without question, the world - as we know it now - is swiftly becoming more complex. We’re losing touch with our sense of community, our sense of place, and even our sense of Self.  </p><p>At The Common Ground Project, we understand that healthy human/landscape relationships are essential to not only our mutual well-being and, ultimately, survival, but also to our reaching higher potentials of being fully human.  Here, we leave behind the pressures of the urban world and reconnect with nature; We’re drawing strength from wild places while honoring those who lived here before us; Building a community that stands for inclusivity, adventure, learning, and sharing our stories… one campfire at a time.</p><p>The impact? It is what we make of it.

With (14) participants per retreat and a cost of $2500 per person, this will cover our second tier of fundraising needs!  Spaces will be offered to the first who sign up through our perk! 2 five-day retreats | 14 participants per retreat | summer 2019Please explore our website to learn more about our Summer 2019 Retreats!  They will be adventures unlike any others simply because participants will be the first to attend The Common Ground Project's immersive tipi camping retreats. Contact us for details!With $70,000 for facilities and $70,000 for the first two retreats, that puts us at $140,000.  Lastly, we're adding another $10,000 to cover all of the outside services from accountants to administrative and fundraising fees.  This brings our total target to $150,000.  Last but not least...  we are calling on the global community to help us spread the word and support our vision.  Any contributions surpassing our target will go directly into forming a scholarship fund for future students to come share this special place together.  Our student programs are designed to be cross-cultural, educational, inspiring, and adventurous!  There is no better time than now to invite young, thriving minds, to explore wild places together, share campfires, and foster meaningful connections with one another.  Through the weaving of our stories may we find common ground. Daniel and students flying a drone on the Anderson Ranch. Photo Credit: Louise Johns A presentation in the barn at the Anderson Ranch. Photo Credit: Louise Johns For social innovators and corporate retreats we have a highly advanced program offering both recreational and interactive learning opportunities for participants! This is cross-pollinating at a whole new level; bringing together a global network of highly motivated and influential people. Retreats will be guided by world renowned educators, facilitators, and people who work in conservation. How can you help?  Great question! We have a myriad of options for those of you who are inspired to support our campaign.  To begin, let's just say that we are MORE than excited to offer you a host of special perks from tangible goodies, to artwork, and experiences both at and away from our campfire.  As outlined above, there are 28 open vacancies for those who want to be the first to experience The Common Ground Project's retreats during the summer of 2019. These will go fast! Please contact us if you have questions!  We are also offering:
A guided fishing trip outfitted with fly rods (that you take home with you!) and lodging at the spectacular Sage Lodge in Paradise Valley, Montana.
Cozy wool beanies with The Common Ground Project's custom embroidered logo.
Our special ""Old Man"" hat!  
""From-the-ranch"" Skype sessions to classrooms, board rooms, and living rooms all around the world.
And signed photographs from a handful of our favorite and worldly photographers:
      What happens if we don't reach our goal of $150,000?  To begin, our goal is divided into sections as detailed above, so the first target is actually $70,000 (used to build out our camping facilities). From here, it's the next $70,000 to bring in our first two retreats for summer, 2019! A breeze, right? Not quite. We understand the very real constraints we're up against and are prepared to manage any level of support, even if small compared to that of our target.  Anything helps! The priority will be in buying tipis and building our facility!Here's another point worth sharing: In trying to offer options for folks who really love what we're trying to create but can't afford to participate in a retreat, we are offering unique and meaningful perks that are VERY important to meeting and surpassing our target.  Our friends in social media will have access to almost 1.2 MILLION sets of eyes from all around the world!  But let's see how much farther we can take it!!Calling all heavy hitters on Instagram!  We're asking for you to help us spread the word!  As with any new venture (and adventure!) there are inherent risks.  Truth be told, we will be challenged to make The Common Ground Project what we envision it to be without the appropriate financial foundation.  This is something we take very seriously and - if need be - we will step back and re-establish how we bring The Common Ground Project to life.  So what’s the risk aside from a thorough revamp of our strategy? What’s the real risk? The risk is witnessing a national and global community that doesn’t value meaningful connections between people of all walks of life; it is in observing a larger community that doesn’t feel the elemental pull of fire and the sense of adventurous spirit brought out in wild places; The risk is exposing ourselves, our values, and philosophies and finding that the world simply doesn’t resonate.  Aside from these risks, we don’t fear the obstacles that have yet to come.  We have a highly motivated team, and one with a myriad of experiences culminating into a what one friend quoted as “The Perfect Storm.”  It is in this perfect storm that we’ll sharpen our focus, pivot as needed, and continue to espouse the values we stand for: Inclusivity, adventure, learning, sharing, co-creating, giving back, and caring for each other and the planet. THE IMPACTWithout question, the world - as we know it now - is swiftly becoming more complex. We’re losing touch with our sense of community, our sense of place, and even our sense of Self.  At The Common Ground Project, we understand that healthy human/landscape relationships are essential to not only our mutual well-being and, ultimately, survival, but also to our reaching higher potentials of being fully human.  Here, we leave behind the pressures of the urban world and reconnect with nature; We’re drawing strength from wild places while honoring those who lived here before us; Building a community that stands for inclusivity, adventure, learning, and sharing our stories… one campfire at a time.The impact? It is what we make of it. May our fire be an invitation to learn and grow, together.  If only to be open to the potential, and if only to firmly believe in this:""We are more connected than we are divided."" Here's a testimonial from one of our participants from summer, 2018: OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELPOK! If you've read this far we are more than grateful!  Please consider the many options for contributing to this campaign, proudly wear a beanie or hat this winter, decorate your home with a signed photograph from one of our friends, and come see us in Montana at one of our opening retreats this summer! If none of these are an option for you, that's OK!  You can still help by spreading the word.  Crowd-funding has proven over and over to be a powerful tool for building awareness and generating seed money for start-ups; at it's core is the essence of the crowd and THAT starts with spreading the word.  Please, help us by sharing our story.  The big world of social media is a great starting point and IndieGoGo also has its own sharing tools. If you're really into it, call a friend and email your colleagues, fellow students, peers, and family members.  We can't do this without you!  Questions?  Please don't hesitate to contact us!

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We're looking to raise at least $10,000 this year for the operations cost of Whiteaker Block Party. Remember, this is a completely free event and 100% volunteer driven! <strong>Not a single cent goes toward the organizers of WBP.</strong></p>
<p>Our operational budget last year was close to $42,000. All of that money went in to giving you and all who visit us access to multiple stages, over 30 musicians and bands, wild entertainment, and free fun! Even $5 from all of you that come to enjoy the event would get us to our goal and beyond!</p>

<h3>What will your contributions go to?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure costs including rentals for stages and lighting</li>
<li>Permit and city fees</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Security</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above are some of the necessary items that we are required to have for the WBP to have it's event. They're also the most expensive and cost far over the $10,000 we're looking to raise here!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, any funds raised through this campaign will still go toward all the above listed areas.</p>
<p>Perks listed will be available for pick-up at the info booth day of event unless otherwise requested.</p>
<p>As the Whiteaker Block Party has grown over the past 10 years, so has the cost and the demand on resources. </p>
<p>As the late and great Brad Coffey said, the Whiteaker Block Party is ""Seeking to preserve and enhance the social fabric of the Whiteaker Neighborhood. Engaging it in merriment, and exploring within it the pathways winding across the moral spectrum. We seek to foster communities through our libations, our celebrations, and our pop-up driveway dance parties by partnering with and promoting the creative pulse in our neighborhood.""</p>
<p>Your contribution will help make the 2017 Whiteaker Block Party better than ever and aid in keeping this annual event free for you and anyone that attends!</p>

<p>I’m a capoeira teacher, writer, and community improver, most of all an educator. I’ve been promoting Latin American Culture around the world and especially in Japan for almost 20 years. In 2011 I received my Master’s degree from Waseda University here in Tokyo and have been doing my best to make my community internationally and culturally aware through my Capoeira Zoador Academy. The best part of being here has been the amazing opportunity to connect with like-minded people who feel the way I do about cultural education. Takeshi (Contramestre of Capoeira/Super Chef) and Bobby (Language Teacher Extraordinaire): this team is my inspiration and support, as is each and every student I have taught throughout my life.</p>
<p>My Capoeira Zoador Academy has been a cornerstone of Brazilian culture in Tokyo and Asia for 15 years, but now it is time to evolve and do even more positive projects. It is our goal to open Tokyo's first Latin American cultural center near Hatanodai station in Tokyo.<br/>    <br/>Our mission is to create a Latin American (Americas) “third space” for international cultural exchange, language learning, cuisine, music, art and dance all in a centralized and convenient location in the same space or within a few minutes of each other. A third space is a place people identify with on a personal level, after the home and work-space.</p>
<p>Our philosophy and vision is simple. We believe that the positive promotion and exchange of Latin American culture, music, art, dance, and cuisine will improve our community, and our city. It will bring a much-needed energetic spark to Japan. This idea was born from my love of culture and education. Cultural Education is the one thing I have seen in my life that brings people together, be it through music, dance, language, or cuisine.</p>
<p>In the area we are planning to locate, there is nothing comparable to what we will do. By locating the cultural center in the same area, it will save people travel time and money. It will be in a sense a holistic center to promote a better lifestyle, which is crucially needed in Japan that ranks second highest in developed nations in suicide rates. All of these aspects will be linked together by the Café/Restaurant as a meeting space for food, and social and cultural interaction. Although other small schools, or café/restaurants exist in Tokyo, no one has brought it all together.</p>
<p>We have decided to open up the cultural center near Hatanodai station because this is still the same area as our long time Capoeira Zoador Academy. We also have a fan base in the area that we have built over the last 15 years (19 years in Japan total). This we will carry over to the café/restaurant and language school, as well as the new Capoeira Zoador academy school. This station is also the location of one of the biggest medical schools in Japan. Medical students have a strong need of language courses, especially English education. It is still an area with a growing population. It is situated between a junction between the Ikegami line and the Oimachi Line. Census reports 40 thousand people a day pass through the station gates.  </p>
<p>The location will be opened within 3-6 months upon finding a proper space. We already have our eyes on several locations and we are just waiting for the crowdfunding project to end to move forward. This will get us up and running right before the summer rush of 2019.</p>
<p>Budget:<br/>Academy space 80 square meters. café/restaurant space 80 square meters but separated by a removable wall for use during events. Language School space 25 square meters. In total 185 square meters. In this location, rent is about $130 for a measurement (3.30 square meters). We are looking for about 56 Tsubo, which will come to $7,280 per month rent. Of course this depends on many factors. It is common for a landlord to ask for 6 months of rent and deposit. So a safe estimate is $40,000.</p>
<p>Our biggest savings will come from volunteer labor for remodeling because remodeling costs will be kept under $30,000 for cafe/restaurant. The academy will cost $5,000, as we have most of what we need. The language school will also cost $5,000. We can keep our remodeling/construction costs to $50,000 total for all three projects.</p>
<p>We are confident we can raise half of the necessary $90,000, but we really need help with the other half. So our hope is to raise $50,000 to help and cover the Indiegogo fees.</p>

<h2>Insert the Tibetan flag emoji - because representation matters</h2>
<p>Whether you use them or not, emoji are now a part of daily life, featuring on every smartphone and social media platform in the world. Emoji have been referred to as  ""the fastest growing form of language in history"" and for many they now form a <i>vital</i><strong> </strong>part of online communication. Because of this, <strong>the decisions made on which emoji do and do not appear in this new language are extremely important and can have far-reaching effects</strong>.</p>
<p>For the most part,<strong> the people in charge of emoji have done a good job of making sure everyone is represented in this new digital language</strong> - from recent updates which have allowed users to customise hair colour and skin-tones, to ensuring that males and females are equally depicted.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540469515/l66iwtl9bptbvvm8grp1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Perhaps the most important area of the emoji lexicon when it comes to representation is the flags section</strong>. Flags represent the most comprehensive and universally recognised symbols through which communities around the world communicate their identity and a sense of belonging - <strong>yet the Tibetan flag is nowhere to be seen</strong>. <strong>Representation matters. We must remedy this.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540471550/ctzvztjwmdjc8b2mxkj8.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How will we get the Tibetan flag emoji?</h2>
<p>The selection of emoji is decided by a group called the <strong>Unicode Consortium</strong>, made up mostly of representatives from the big tech companies like Google and Apple. They meet several times a year to decide which emoji should be added to the official list.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that a committee made up mostly of white, wealthy, men isn't always up to the task of deciding on the communication needs of the entire world. So, to their credit, <strong>they accept proposals for new emoji from the public</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The submission process is incredibly long and complex</strong> - taking up to <strong>two years</strong> and requiring some pretty <strong>major technical expertise</strong>. However, <strong>with your help</strong>, we will have the resources to see the entire process through to the end - and hopefully <strong>end up with a new Tibetan flag emoji on all our phones!</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540480530/albtpvtbwmrzddgcvebf.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540480543/nyuvnbbfq79hqw1ojkbn.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540478153/vvjpdhzaoiecsgxl4lzu.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540478142/n4ytwhoj2jvsqcfjaefn.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540478173/azmoa3umgwj5xbygsh1b.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540478183/tncizuwjfpqb0yyv1zlz.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540478192/hul0vwnex43vkhmyvall.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540478205/pdmjwvcxnhazv5sarckz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As well as the proposal, we will be running an <strong>awareness campaign</strong>. <strong>A major part of the approval process involves being able to show mass public support for the inclusion of the proposed emoji</strong>. Our campaign will <strong>help raise awareness of the lack of a Tibetan flag emoji</strong>, and encourage the public to <strong>show their support</strong> for its inclusion. Along the way we will also be <strong>introducing the flag to a whole new audience of people who may never have heard about Tibetan culture before</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>What will we use the money for?</h2>
<p>First and foremost, the money will go towards <strong>submitting the best possible proposal</strong>. Without the proposal, there can be no Tibetan flag emoji so this is the most important element. The money will be spent on things like external consultants to help us with the technical details and graphic design work to help us make the emoji look perfect. We will also be working with  Tibet-support organisations on both the proposal and the campaign.</p>
<p>The remaining funds will go towards<strong> running the best campaign we can</strong> to raise awareness with the public. This may include things like:</p>

</div></div>","Insert the Tibetan flag emoji - because representation matters
Whether you use them or not, emoji are now a part of daily life, featuring on every smartphone and social media platform in the world. Emoji have been referred to as  ""the fastest growing form of language in history"" and for many they now form a vital part of online communication. Because of this, the decisions made on which emoji do and do not appear in this new language are extremely important and can have far-reaching effects.
For the most part, the people in charge of emoji have done a good job of making sure everyone is represented in this new digital language - from recent updates which have allowed users to customise hair colour and skin-tones, to ensuring that males and females are equally depicted.

Perhaps the most important area of the emoji lexicon when it comes to representation is the flags section. Flags represent the most comprehensive and universally recognised symbols through which communities around the world communicate their identity and a sense of belonging - yet the Tibetan flag is nowhere to be seen. Representation matters. We must remedy this.

 
How will we get the Tibetan flag emoji?
The selection of emoji is decided by a group called the Unicode Consortium, made up mostly of representatives from the big tech companies like Google and Apple. They meet several times a year to decide which emoji should be added to the official list.
It should come as no surprise that a committee made up mostly of white, wealthy, men isn't always up to the task of deciding on the communication needs of the entire world. So, to their credit, they accept proposals for new emoji from the public.
The submission process is incredibly long and complex - taking up to two years and requiring some pretty major technical expertise. However, with your help, we will have the resources to see the entire process through to the end - and hopefully end up with a new Tibetan flag emoji on all our phones!

As well as the proposal, we will be running an awareness campaign. A major part of the approval process involves being able to show mass public support for the inclusion of the proposed emoji. Our campaign will help raise awareness of the lack of a Tibetan flag emoji, and encourage the public to show their support for its inclusion. Along the way we will also be introducing the flag to a whole new audience of people who may never have heard about Tibetan culture before.
 

What will we use the money for?
First and foremost, the money will go towards submitting the best possible proposal. Without the proposal, there can be no Tibetan flag emoji so this is the most important element. The money will be spent on things like external consultants to help us with the technical details and graphic design work to help us make the emoji look perfect. We will also be working with  Tibet-support organisations on both the proposal and the campaign.
The remaining funds will go towards running the best campaign we can to raise awareness with the public. This may include things like:
   Promotional videos and graphics
   Merchandise like shirts, hats and bags with campaign logos and hashtags
   A professional media pack for journalists
   Advertising and PR budget
  Travelling to events to promote the campaign (such as the yearly EmojiCon in New York)
   Hosting our own events and promotional days
Together, we can make sure the Tibetan flag, and Tibetan culture, gets the recognition it deserves.

</ul><p>Thank you Buffalo Fans!  Now, Let’s Just Build It!</p></div>","Several years ago members of 3 Buffalo Hall of Fame Boards got together and talked about how they didn’t have a place to honor their members and share the wealth of memorabilia they had from great moments in Buffalo’s sports, music and broadcasting.Some wise soul in the group said – “well, why don’t we team up and build one full Buffalo Experience?”Another said, “that’s a great idea – especially since music, sports and broadcasting all intersect in so many ways”A third person chimed in, “and everyone who has lived in Buffalo or loves this town has been touched by one, if not all three”All three said, “Hey!  Let’s Just Build It!”Okay, maybe that dialogue is a little bit fiction, but not entirely.  If you love Buffalo you know we have some of the greats – Jim Kelly and Thurman Thomas, Rick James and the Goo Goo Dolls, and media that has covered it all and kept us informed throughout our lives here in the Queen City.                       The three boards collaborated and formed the BFLO Hall of Fame Experience to let you, your friends and family relive the great moments, share your own memories and be a star on the stage, set or field.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>""Destination Lithuanian America 2018"" is <strong>two large things in one</strong>.</p>
<p>The main one of them is the <strong>free interactive map</strong>, where each of America's Lithuanian sites will be marked, have its photographs and story added.</p>
<p>This map, however, would be impossible without a <strong>painstaking expedition</strong> which we will launch in 2018 August. During this expedition, we'll visit <strong>200-400 Lithuanian heritage sites</strong> in the US Mid-West, we'll drive 3500+ miles between them, we'll meet more than 100 people who will tell us the stories of the Lithuanian heritage, we'll take pictures for the map. The expedition will be covered in published diaries and you will be able to follow it on the social media.</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p><strong>We have already completed the first leg of this project</strong>, mapping 330 Lithuanian sites in the 11 states of New England and Mid-Atlantic, taking 8500 photos and meeting almost 200 people. The map is available on <a href=""http://map.truelithuania.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://map.truelithuania.com</a> , and it is this same map that will be expanded with new information. After the 2018 expansion, it will cover the areas where 70% of Lithuanian-Americans live and 90% of Lithuanian-American heritage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since 2012, I (project leader Augustinas Žemaitis) am doing the <a href=""http://global.truelithuania.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://global.truelithuania.com</a> <strong>website on the Lithuanian sites abroad</strong>. I became interested in it after I witnessed what major Lithuanian sites exist beyond Lithuania and how little they are known. I dug for the information in libraries and archives, I checked it on satellite images and ""Google street view"" and, eventually, in person. Currently, 30 countries are included on the website.</p>
<p>We already researched the preliminary information about many of the Lithuanian sites in Mid-West, so we will be able to concentrate the expedition on things that could be only done on-site (exploration, picture-taking, coordinate-marking, live interviews) and not waste time on doing what could be also done elsewhere.</p>
<p>All our projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help the <strong>Lithuanian diaspora discover their roots</strong> by visiting and learning about the Lithuanian sites worldwide.</li>
<li>Help <strong>Lithuanians from Lithuania to understand the importance of Lithuanian-American ties </strong>and encourages them to visit these sites when travelling to America.</li>
<li>Help non-Lithuanian Americans to <strong>learn about yet another important-yet-forgotten minority</strong> that helped to construct the modern USA.</li>
<li>Help <strong>neighbours of the Lithuanian sites to learn more about what is next to them</strong>.</li>
<li>Help to <strong>protect the Lithuanian heritage </strong>by drawing attention towards it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I addition to the websites, my articles on Lithuanian heritage and interviews with me have been published in Lithuanian, Lithuanian-American and non-Lithuanian media. More articles are going to appear after the ""Destination Lithuanian America 2018"" mission.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The first part of ""Destination Lithuanian America 2018"" is an expedition to map and photograph the heritage on-site, as well as to hear its stories. In order for the mission to be successful, we need to cover large distances in short time and be able to reach remote sites. For that, the only viable option is <strong>car rental</strong>, which will also bring in the <strong>fuel costs, parking costs, </strong>and<strong> road tolls</strong>.</p>
<p>During the expedition, we will also incur significant expenses on <strong>accommodation</strong><span> and </span><strong>food</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Getting to Chicago</strong>, where the expedition begins, and back will also cost money.</p>
<p>In order to successfully agree on meetings with Lithuanian-Americans, as well as manage the social media, we'll need <strong>telephone and internet access</strong> throughout the expedition.</p>
<p>Some Lithuanian-related heritage objects we plan to visit and map charge <strong>entrance fees</strong>.</p>
<p>After returning from ""Destination - America 2018"", we will <strong>expand the interactive map</strong> with new information. This will also have its costs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, such a map is useful only if it is used widely, therefore, we will aim to popularize it through <strong>marketing</strong>.</p>
<p>Without all this, the project would not be possible.</p>
<p>In return for support, we offer (in addition to the map itself, which is free of charge):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Being mentioned as a sponsor on the map website</strong>. Depending on the amount, you will get your <strong>name</strong> and <strong>photo </strong>included, whereas the major supporters will also have their brief <strong>life story </strong>published, including their previous work for Lithuanian heritage, minority heritage, or other similar fields. It is possible to opt-out if you want to stay anonymous.</li>
<li>
<strong>Memorabilia of the project</strong>, such as <strong>postcards</strong> and <strong>t-shirts</strong> made and dedicated especially for you.</li>
<li>For those who will pledge the most, we offer a <strong>personal lecture on the Lithuanian-American </strong><strong>heritage </strong>by us, or even the possibility to change the plan of the project by <strong>visiting your area</strong> and marking the Lithuanian heritage there as well. These sponsorship options may be great not only for a single person but also for a group of people or organizations.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The project is sound, as its creators have an experience in running a very similar first leg of the project, with Augustinas Žemaitis researching the Lithuanian heritage abroad extensively since 2012.</p>
<p>The only risk could be the project's dependence on the experience and knowledge of Augustinas Žemaitis, which could cause problems if something would happen to him. However, Augustinas, having worked on the popularisation of Lithuanian-American heritage for a long time, has no intention of quitting and is the major driving force under this Indiegogo campaign.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you like the project, please <strong>follow us on Facebook</strong> on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/truelithuania/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/truelithuania/</a> </p>
<p>If you like the project very much, please <strong>share it with your friends</strong>. Don't forget to give the link to the already existing map ( <a href=""http://map.truelithuania.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://map.truelithuania.com</a> ) - especially if they live in New England or Mid-Atlantic regions that are mapped already or in the Mid-West.</p>
<p>If you are a Lithuanian-American or know stories about the Lithuanian-American heritage (buildings, monuments, cemeteries, etc.) in your area - <strong>please contact us and meet to talk to us</strong>, we will write that down! This does not cost anything - only your time. Only because of people such as you, we are able to make this project great!</p>
<p>If you want to help us even more and you live along the expedition route - you may offer two of us to <strong>spend a single night at your home</strong> (that way we would save on the accommodation that night).</p>

Some Lithuanian-related heritage objects we plan to visit and map charge entrance fees.
After returning from ""Destination - America 2018"", we will expand the interactive map with new information. This will also have its costs.
Furthermore, such a map is useful only if it is used widely, therefore, we will aim to popularize it through marketing.
Without all this, the project would not be possible.
In return for support, we offer (in addition to the map itself, which is free of charge):


Being mentioned as a sponsor on the map website. Depending on the amount, you will get your name and photo included, whereas the major supporters will also have their brief life story published, including their previous work for Lithuanian heritage, minority heritage, or other similar fields. It is possible to opt-out if you want to stay anonymous.

Memorabilia of the project, such as postcards and t-shirts made and dedicated especially for you.
For those who will pledge the most, we offer a personal lecture on the Lithuanian-American heritage by us, or even the possibility to change the plan of the project by visiting your area and marking the Lithuanian heritage there as well. These sponsorship options may be great not only for a single person but also for a group of people or organizations.


Risks & Challenges
The project is sound, as its creators have an experience in running a very similar first leg of the project, with Augustinas Žemaitis researching the Lithuanian heritage abroad extensively since 2012.
The only risk could be the project's dependence on the experience and knowledge of Augustinas Žemaitis, which could cause problems if something would happen to him. However, Augustinas, having worked on the popularisation of Lithuanian-American heritage for a long time, has no intention of quitting and is the major driving force under this Indiegogo campaign.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you like the project, please follow us on Facebook on https://www.facebook.com/truelithuania/ 
If you like the project very much, please share it with your friends. Don't forget to give the link to the already existing map ( http://map.truelithuania.com ) - especially if they live in New England or Mid-Atlantic regions that are mapped already or in the Mid-West.
If you are a Lithuanian-American or know stories about the Lithuanian-American heritage (buildings, monuments, cemeteries, etc.) in your area - please contact us and meet to talk to us, we will write that down! This does not cost anything - only your time. Only because of people such as you, we are able to make this project great!
If you want to help us even more and you live along the expedition route - you may offer two of us to spend a single night at your home (that way we would save on the accommodation that night).",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The Firebird Festival is an annual celebration of arts and culture that is held in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>This year marks the 14th year of the festival, as it returns to Friendship Field on December 9th, 2017.</p>
<p><a href=""http://firebirdfestival.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://firebirdfestival.com</a></p>
<p>The Firebird Festival mission is to provide an annual celebration of the borough of Phoenixville's namesake - the Phoenix. Just as the Phoenix rose from its own ashes, the town of Phoenixville has risen, and continues to rebuild and improve the local community, after the loss of its principle industry in the early 1980's.<br/>The festival is designed to foster a collaboration of local artistic and creative talent, and to enhance the overall cultural life of Phoenixville.</p>
<p>100+ performers, an expansive craft vendor area, and gourmet food trucks and vendors from the Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs will be on site to welcome the thousands of participants who flock to Phoenixville for the festival. </p>
<p>There will also be a parade from downtown Phoenixville, leading its way up to Friendship Field. The community is encouraged to join in the parade, which will feature paper lanterns, peace birds, puppets, dancers, drummers and more.</p>
<p>There will be continuous shuttle buses connecting downtown to the bird site at Friendship Field.</p>
<p><u><strong>Our Goal</strong></u></p>
<p>We are trying to raise $6,000 through this campaign - by December 8th, 2017. If we can raise that amount in our campaign this year, it will give us the ability to do the great things that are planned for the festival this year - and to plan ahead for next year!</p>
<p><u><strong>How You Can Help</strong></u></p>
<p>There are many elements that go into the festival, ranging from building the bird and providing a safe and comfortable festival experience for the community, to providing entertainment, obtaining insurance, and promoting the festival.</p>
<p>Below is a breakdown of some of the annual expenses that we incur when putting on the festival:</p>
<p>Portable Restrooms - $2,100<br/>Stage &amp; Sound System for Musicians and Performers - $2,500<br/>Compensation for Musicians and Performers - $1,500<br/>Insurance for the Festival - $3,000<br/>Posters, Flyers and Printing for Promotional Material and Programs - $1,000<br/>Wood and Materials for Construction of the Phoenix - $1,000</p>

<p>The play </p>
<p>Set in the heyday of glam rock and science fiction, Rocket Man is a play about family and friends bearing the brunt of a little-understood mental illness. Velvet Goldmine and Withnail &amp; I collide in a small suburb of Cambridge in 1976. This is the latest play from multi-award-winning playwright Tess Humphrey.</p>
<p>The pitch</p>
<p>In 2018 we are raising money and awareness so we can take this play to Edinburgh Fringe in August. Despite having some strong glam rock and sci-fi roots, this play is based on a true story and it’s a story that’s happening to millions of people: it’s a story about the humiliation and isolation a young man faces after a failed suicide attempt. Right now in the UK, suicide is the biggest killer of young men, and while campaigns like TimeToTalk are picking up steam, people still face huge social stigma when their mental illnesses become known. </p>
<p>In this play we and we aim to fight the stigma around bipolar disorder, and around men seeking help for their mental health. While our story is based on real suffering, we hope it leaves you feeling hopeful, uplifted and ready to fight for a society where mental illness is treated with openness and compassion.</p>
<p>We are looking to raise £1300 so that we can perform our show for two weeks at Edinburgh Fringe, the largest theatre platform in the world, to spread our message to hundreds of people.  Updates to follow soon!</p>

We've received tremendous love and support from people who attended. We had a great time creating this experience for thousands of New Yorkers and people who came from near and far to attend this festival love, happiness and spring.It takes a lot to put up a festival at this scale, emotionally and financially. If you attended the festival or think that this tradition of New York should continue, support us on this page. Help us pay the bills and plan on making the next one even better.​Update 4/9/2017: Thank You to everyone who has contributed to making NYC Holi Hai a success so far! We continue to move towards our goal steadily. Don't forget that there are exciting perks coming your way!!  “Holi is the day to express love with colors. All the colors that are on you are of love.” ~ AnonymousOur StoryHi there! My name is Megha Kalia and I am the founder of the NYC Holi Hai festival. I’m a dance artist and a proponent of the celebratory Bhangra dance. I created this festival - free admission and open for everyone - out of a passion to bring diverse communities together to celebrate life.As an immigrant in the US, I realized the importance of having a platform where artists and communities can come together under one roof in an exchange of culture and festivities.The traditional Hindu festival of Holi symbolizes inclusivity and became the inspiration to create a multi-cultural stage of rejoicing and welcoming spring. If we can continue this tradition in New York City, it will become an exemplary model for others to emulate.I want to thank you in advance for believing in the cause. Because of your support we will be able to bring a confluence of diverse communities and tackle hate by challenging the ignorance around us.“Festivals promote diversity, they bring neighbors into dialogue, they increase creativity, they offer opportunities for civic pride, they improve our general psychological well-being. In short, they make cities better places to live.”~ David BinderWhat We NeedWe are raising $25,000 to meet the essential minimum production cost to make this festival happen. Permits & Legal Fee

""America is grappling with cultural diversity, and I just want to put a show on that represents the world in which I live."" ~ David Alan GrierOur Impact
Since beginning in 2010, NYC Holi Hai has hosted on stage over 110 groups and 600 artists from different genres of dance - Indian, Modern & Contemporary, Hip-hop, Latin, Arabian, Korean, Spanish, Native American and others.
Attendees come from over 750 cities and 36 states of the US, and represent more than 40 countries of the world.
The festival has been free admission since 2010 and allowed people from all communities to come together in a joyous way to forgive-and-forget.
“If we cannot now end our differences, at least we can help make the world safe for diversity.” ~ John F. KennedyThe Move
We started the festival in a park by the UN Plaza in 2010 with three hundred people who came to celebrate a joyous day of Holi. Over the years, the message of inclusive diversity and interchange of cultures became a movement.
In 2017, we're moving to the Governors Island, with more space and sunshine.
""Diversity of thought and culture and religion and ideas has been the strength of America."" ~ Gary LockeMedia & Press for NYC Holi Hai
NYC Holi Hai has received love and adulation from many bloggers and journalists for its mission.

“Diversity: the art of thinking independently together.” ~ Malcolm ForbesChallengesFor a dance organization to put this event together is a huge task. The event is open and accessible to anyone and everyone who'd like to be a part of it. We are proud of the support received from past generous donors & helpful volunteers. Without your logistical and financial support it would be impossible for us to organize this event in the most expensive city of the world!“Diversity may be hardest thing for a society to live with, and perhaps the most dangerous thing for a society to be without.” ~ David BinderWays You Can Help
Help us spread the word via social media by inviting your friends and family to be part of the celebration of diversity.
Want to help out with the field work? We are looking for volunteers to help spread the word and manage operations on the day-of. Please contact volunteer@nycbhangra.com.
Attend our fundraiser and toast a night of the meeting of two cultures.

<p dir=""LTR""><strong>Sarab - Strings of Change</strong> is one of A New Dawn in the Negev’s most successful and heart-warming programs. Sarab, which means oasis, strives to change the social reality of the Bedouins of the Negev by providing quality music education, starting with children in elementary schools.  Music develops creativity, attentiveness, and appreciation of beauty; it provides a feeling of identity and belonging, and brings people together in the aim of achieving a common goal. Music education teaches perseverance, concentration, and focus; it affects students' general academic performance and endows them with valuable skills that serve them later in life. Moreover, learning to play an instrument is a time consuming task, keeping children out of trouble. Music can be the start of a different, better life for the Bedouin community, and a new basis for establishing fruitful cooperation and communication between the Bedouin and the Jewish communities.</p>
<p dir=""LTR"">With your generous support we are seeking to purchase ten new instruments including a cello for use in 2016.</p>
<p><strong>A New Dawn in the Negev </strong>is a Bedouin-Jewish, grassroots community-based organization. We work tirelessly to strengthen the next generation of Bedouin youth and young adults, in the Negev region of Southern Israel. We provide them with practical tools and global ambitions to ensure they can thrive in the 21st century. We achieve our goals through providing formal and non-formal education, promoting a shared society and providing leadership and skills-based training to Bedouin boys and girls. We also serve as a network, connecting Israeli and international organizations and initiatives. Through these programs, we further connect the Bedouin youth to the greater society within Israel and globally. Ultimately, A New Dawn sows the seeds for future spirited, moral and ambitious Bedouin leaders.</p>
<p><strong>Impact</strong><br/>The purchase of ten new violins for our program will not only change the lives of over 50 children who will directly play on them, but also the broader community in facilitating exchange and supporting Bedouin talent.</p>

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>The most significant part of this production is the director's intention. As an artist, director Taka Tsubota strongly believes that it is important to talk about the untouchable subjects in his films. Observing the Japanese film industry from an outside perspective (raised in Japan, educated in the US) he grew concerns towards the major networks that tend to reject development of politically and historically challenging material.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487566507/zucbchfskwszxu3zdhcw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>His film Stolen is a political drama that discusses the outcome of a very serious international crime that has affected the lives of many Japanese civilians. In the past, North Korea has intended a series of abduction of ordinary citizens with no explanation or returns. In light of such crimes, the Japanese government has been tied to complicated diplomatic issues that prevented them from helping their people. The popular tendency we see in people who are forced into helpless situations such as this is to internally blame each other; i.e the culture of “victim-shaming”. Stolen challenges the sugarcoated Japanese film industry that shies away from sensitive subjects and openly discuss unspoken matters while exposing the unfiltered culture as it is to the world.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487566725/ea7muvklcm1ixnboar6c.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In previous years the chances of a film like this succeeding commercially in Japan was slim, but in recent years the evolution of video on demand and online tv networks has made the distribution of independent works much easier. Our aim is to distribute our film to a fitting network, and here's how you can help!</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Hey everyone, the producer here:) Thank you so much for visiting our page! Let me explain what's going on here. It says the goal is $2,500, but we are actually trying to raise $5,000. We're using two separate funding systems in America and Japan, split in the middle.</p>
<p>Allow me to break this down for you:</p>
<p>Believe it or not, out of that sum, $3,900 is festival money. Submitting a feature length movie costs about $60~$110 each, and so far, we have about 40 film festivals we want to submit to. Why must we submit to so many festivals, you ask? Well the truth is, festival submission is very similar to dating. It can't be a one way interest. Our film has to match with the prospective film festival. The story must meet the theme of the chosen festival and flow well with the other showing films too. Don't worry! Our quality is up to par-it'll find it's match somewhere, but as you know dating cost money, and so do submissions.</p>
<p>$600 will be used to throw a private screening/small party for you! For our amazing fans, friends and family. Raise $600 first and we'll get a theater, reception space and food. Entry will be free, and you're more than welcome to bring friends!</p>
<p>And lastly, $500 is to cover the indiegogo crowdfunding fee.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Koullouna's coffee box has all the things that remind you of Sundays at grandma’s : black coffee, orange blossom water, the flowery coffee cups, the rakwé… Basically all you need to <strong>feel</strong> at home. </p>

<p>Koullouna also comes with a booklet full of curated content related to the theme of the box.</p>

<p>The best part of all: each Koullouna box will be supporting a local initiative to which a part of your subscription will be donated.</p>
<p>For example, the coffee box supported the Nawaya Network, an organisation that develops local talents. Koullouna contributed to finance the basketball classes of Ahmad, a member of the Nawaya Network.</p>

<p><strong>Marielle Khayat, Founder &amp; CEO</strong></p>
<p>Marielle has been in the innovation and entrepreneurship field for 5 years now. After her studies in Management, she left Lebanon and moved around China and the US  before settling in Paris. Throughout her travels, she stayed passionate about highlighting the good things happening in Lebanon. In 2012, she co-wrote ""Losing Touch"", a book about the disappearing Lebanese trades, that depicted the lives of the trade workers of Beirut.

</div></div>","NEW DELIVERY DATE: April 2018 We did it!We reached our initial goal of  €15,000 and our stretch goal of €25,000, and we have YOU to thank! To all the backers, the early adopters, the believers, the likers, the friends and support system... To all of you that took part in this journey in any possible way, thank you!          In the next 3 months, the team will be working hard on bringing you (and your loved ones) the warmest, most exciting box you could ask for, all the way from Lebanon. Oh, and of course, we will be planting 336 trees in Lebanon, one in the name of each of our backers :)   To stay updated on what we're up to, sign up for our newsletter on our website You can still purchase a box on this campaign and we will follow up with more details concerning shipping and gifting! Much love, The Koullouna team 
Koullouna is a monthly subscription box keeping Lebanese expats and Lebanon-lovers connected to the country. It's the perfect balance between getting a piece of home at your doorstep and sending back a piece of you to Lebanon.

So every month, you would get a box (a package) at your doorstep. Each box will follow a different theme and will be a surprise. And who doesn't love a good surprise? :)
Koullouna will offer you the chance to:


 

Here's what happens from the moment you order your box to the moment you open it:









The first Koullouna box was around the ‘Coffee’ theme. It traveled all the way from Beirut to New York, Dubai, Paris and Marseille! 
Keep in mind that this is a prototype box.

 
A box with handpicked products
Koullouna's coffee box has all the things that remind you of Sundays at grandma’s : black coffee, orange blossom water, the flowery coffee cups, the rakwé… Basically all you need to feel at home. 

The funds raised with this campaign will allow us to develop higher quality and more beautifully crafted boxes. 
A box with a story
Koullouna also comes with a booklet full of curated content related to the theme of the box.

 
A box with an impact
The best part of all: each Koullouna box will be supporting a local initiative to which a part of your subscription will be donated.
For example, the coffee box supported the Nawaya Network, an organisation that develops local talents. Koullouna contributed to finance the basketball classes of Ahmad, a member of the Nawaya Network.
 

 

Koullouna is a box for anyone who loves Lebanon and wants to make a difference!

At the end of the campaign, we will send you a personalised gift card (like the below) that you can offer to your loved one for Christmas :)


After a year of experimenting, testing, measuring and developing the Koullouna box, we are now ready to go big, and we want this piece of Lebanese goodness to be available to everyone and start having an impact on the country! 
The funds raised with your help will allow us to:

Develop the design of the box and quality of our product
Ship and deliver your boxes
Launch our online shop
Give the project all it needs to kick-off with a bang!

Here's where we're at:

 




Marielle Khayat, Founder & CEO
Marielle has been in the innovation and entrepreneurship field for 5 years now. After her studies in Management, she left Lebanon and moved around China and the US  before settling in Paris. Throughout her travels, she stayed passionate about highlighting the good things happening in Lebanon. In 2012, she co-wrote ""Losing Touch"", a book about the disappearing Lebanese trades, that depicted the lives of the trade workers of Beirut. The success of this experience was yet another proof of how much power the Lebanese can draw from their love of the country. Today, she's still convinced that being far doesn't mean being disconnected, and so Koullouna was born!

We are setting aside a minimum of 100 000€ in the first phase to ensure College of Wizardry prevails, including a 20 000€ down payment on Czocha castle so that it's reserved for the April events, and an additional 20 000€ for event costs in arrear for the German language event ""Nibelungen"", hosted earlier this year. This is done ahead of this campaign and funded separately. And we are giving free ticket vouchers to the several hundred current ticket-holders that are left stranded. We are serious about Saving College of Wizardry. But we need your help to get started! See more about P and our work at the end of this page.</i></p><p><i><strong>We act fast</strong> or the magic school may be closed for years, or may never be able to open again!

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why are we doing this?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""We love this world and the people in it!""</i></p>
<p>We love College of Wizardry. There is probably no other experience that has introduced so many people world-wide to larping (from contemporary magic fiction and Harry Potter buffs, to passionate larpers). It has employed and trained amateur organisers, volunteers, professionals and hobby crafters and artists. And while the venture grew too big for the earlier organisers, the larp itself is strong, quirky and amazing. It is probably the most vibrant contemporary magic larp and story universe out there.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""It has changed my life in ways I never expected, giving me an international family of fantastic people, and has even become part of what I do for a living.""</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>– Liselle Awwal</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">For all non-magic graduates out there</h3>
<p>College of Wizardry is a magical story universe, where the participants populate the world in real, live events. At its core, a beloved live action role-playing series (so called ""larps"", think cosplay with make-believe) about a magic school that has run 20 main events so far at Czocha castle in Poland.</p>
<p>We make costumes, wands and mystical artefacts, write stories and create characters–and generally behave as if we can do magic. Of course it's all really an excuse to be humans together (or non-humans)!<br/> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552221162/nw3xg9lq2sxacoebgpv8.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://www.wizardry.college"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">wizardry.college</a><br/><br/> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">If we don't, there may be no coming back</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""It is vital to continue now""</i></p>
<p>Without this fundraiser, College of Wizardry may be unable to rebuild, or may need years to open the doors again. But if we can run the cancelled events in Spring, we ensure there is a future and can make tickets available for more players to experience the magic. So by helping these stranded people, we help reopen College of Wizardry for everyone!</p>
<p>Aside from being unfair to the players, an extended break also threatens the availability of the fantastic castle location in the future. And a pause will seriously impact the event production side (as the props and production pipeline would have to be partly rebuilt from scratch). As it stands now, College of Wizardry has both gear and crew ready to go. We are going to rehire all these talented people and make the events happen.<br/> </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Coming together to make this work</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>Our goal is to reopen College of Wizardry by first making the events in April possible, open the November event ticket sales, and from there bring more magical experiences and commission more amazing talents, showing this magical reality to the world!</i></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Is there a deadline?</h3>
<p>Yes and no. The sooner, the better for all players, the crew and castle preparations. We’ll keep fighting all the way, seek investors and sponsors.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The first donations</h3>
<p>Every little bit helps, and tells the World that College of Wizardry is determined to live on. So any support is dearly appreciated, pledge as little or as much you like. Or just spread the word? Check out the special perks displayed on the right side on this campaign page with unique art and items donated by College of Wizardry supporters. Including limited items to keep as a personal memory, or to publicly show your support.</p>
<p>Any contribution will be invested in full, earmarked to rebuild College of Wizardry and run events. All contributions help to preserve College of Wizardry over time, but we would love to reopen the doors now. That is our first goal, not just to help those players, but because that is the first stepping stone to preserve College of Wizardry!</p>

The prize for some items is much lower than comparative retail cost. For some it is higher, as this is a charitable fundraiser. We are also going to offer ticket vouchers, these are at latest price level, with a little added to pay for Indiegogo and banking fees and for this fundraiser. By getting that perk you support Save College of Wizardry <i>and</i> get at reserved and paid spot!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What if we can't raise all the money?</h3>
<p>If we fail to raise all the funds, things will take longer, maybe years, but College of Wizardry will reopen its doors! With Indiegogo flexible funding, every contribution will be invested in full, earmarked specifically to rebuild College of Wizardry and run events in the future. All contributions help preserve College of Wizardry over time, and the more we get the faster we get there.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552221617/phullcmwlmyfxnslpoe4.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The immediate needs</h3>
<p>What does the College of Wizardry need right now to survive? To run the upcoming events, to reaffirm the relationship with the community and with Czocha castle. Before this happens, no major investor will back the IP, and it would be hard to say if the players would come back. But if we reopen the doors now, we are confident we can <u>keep</u> them open.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">""Unfortunately it's not like we can just go to some goblin bank<br/>–those don't really exist in this world.""</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome of this fundraiser, P is giving free ticket vouchers for future events to all current ticket-holders, but better yet would be to run the events as originally intended. To enable this crowdfunding campaign, P makes a down payment to Czocha castle of twenty thousand Euro, which means the incredible location is booked and reserved for College of Wizardry to happen on the original dates!</p>
<p><strong>How will your contributions be invested?</strong><br/>The goal is to immediately reopen College of Wizardry for witches and wizards. To preserve it so it can stand on its own legs again. One of the most important uses of the contributions is to be able to rehire Lead Producer Robin Steen, Iryt and the crew and freelancers for the 2019 events. The entire team is ready to go, with full support from P. After making good towards the crew, we would also like to commission some amazing talent and experts to support them.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, by running these events we ensure College of Wizardry is in good shape moving forward. We can reopen ticket sales and from there it's a matter of bringing more magic to more people, better, sooner and more fantastic!</p>
<p>All in all about half of the funding needs this year are the Indiegogo campaign for the April events and related costs. The other half is development investments by The company P to preserve College of Wizardry, funded outside this crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552052120/uwutcw1fa3u1isppzvji.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As a reference, a high-level budget for the 2019 April events and costs for the first phase of reconstructing College of Wizardry is estimated to include Indiegogo and bank fees, conversion costs et cetera ca 10 000€, Location, set &amp; props etc, castle rent, food, consumables ca 65 000€, Documentation, character photographs and other services ca 10 000€, Busses, transportation, other ca 15 000€.</p>

<p>The whole point of this fundraiser is to save College of Wizardry and make it available to the World again. To make that a reality, contributions will first go directly to pay for castle rent, food and other consumables, staff and freelancers, set dressing, costume, gear, travel and transportation et cetera to run the events in Spring. If we manage that, College of Wizardry will reopen its doors. The events in Fall will open for new players, and we will have preserved the magic for the future!</p>

Such as cuter, friendlier playful events for children of all ages. Or the darker, rawer consequences of spell casting for seekers of the horrifying. Inclusiveness, such as ethnicity, language and accessibility and gender would also be expanded.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Thoughts on the long-term plan</h3>
<p>We want to bring the College of Wizardry to the rest of the world. To take the magic to new fans and more places.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""It's time to kick in some doors and make the entertainment industry embrace the incredible warmth, intimacy and creativity of larping! We know both Hollywood and Magicwood, and its high time to let the beings of both mingle.""</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>– Christopher Sandberg, Founder P</i></p>
<p>P will create a professional concept video reel and look book. This will involve many creatives from College of Wizardry for commissioned work, along with leading industry creatives. P will set up pitch calls with investors, agents, studios, networks and streamers. With the aim to see how the magic can expand to a larger audience of non-larper and larpers alike, set in this fantastic story universe.</p>
<p>P has created, produced and collaborated on several award-winning prime-time drama series and transmedia productions, all including immersive theatre and larp events. P has also worked for several years advising one of the largest theme park operators in the world, on the development of participatory experiences. P Directed and Produced the global immersive launch event for Unknown 9, with Sleep No More and McKittrick hotel in New York, together with Cirque du Soleil founder's immersive company Reflector Entertainment. This garnished over one hundred million press impressions world-wide and is nominated for the Shorty Awards in ""Best use of Storytelling"".</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> None of this would in any way intrude on the privacy and immersion of the larps. These will remain a safe-haven and the heart of the College of Wizardry world.</p>
<p>The company P is estimating it will invest ca 100 000€ in the first phase (on things such as insurance, legal fees, and development for investors and partners to come in and support). This is funded outside the Indiegogo campaign and should extra support come in it first goes go to creative commissions for development and presentation materials et cetera to the community and freelancers and professionals (see Stretch goals).</p>
<p>This includes getting it ready for major investor support, with the aim to set up a dedicated College of Wizardry company. This company is one we hope to run with and be owned in part by the community. As this would be quite a complex international set up, it will take time to figure out and to make sure that it is professionally managed, so that the situation it is in now isn't repeated.</p>
<p>To that end an analysis, business plan, investment white paper, creative brief and project pitches will be professionally produced. Brought to international event partners and entertainment and culture investors and funds, with the vision to collaborate with others to bring College of Wizardry to more people. This may include translations to other languages, establishing in other countries and on new continents, and reaching other demographics such as families and kids.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Sales partners</span></li>
<li>Research and academia partners</li>
<li>Agents</li>
<li>Transmedia and game expansions</li>
<li>Expansions into new markets and language translations</li>
</ul>
<p>P wants to preserve College of Wizardry and also try to let more people experience the magic, and we are confident we can secure funding over time. Moving forward, we would seek international partnerships not only for development funding, sales and publishing, and event production, but also to explore possible formats for expanding the universe into storytelling accessible to more people (such as a participatory drama series). We have direct relationships with all major networks and streamers, with many years of awarded productions in our portfolio.</p>
<p><i>The company P Founder Christopher Sandberg is a returning juror to several leading international funds for participatory storytelling in Europe and North America, with experience from funding many tens of millions of dollars in projects. As an example of such ventures, P produced the Emmy-nominated <a href=""http://conspiracyforgood.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Conspiracy For Good</a>, created with Tim Kring (Heroes, Treadstone), where we worked with Nokia to raise funds to build several libraries in Zambia, Africa, together with <a href=""https://www.roomtoread.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Room To Read</a>, stocking them with books, giving scholarships to girls, and create awareness about literacy. We feel we can give College of Wizardry expertise and care, and are honoured for the opportunity to support this community. </i><i>For more on P's work in participatory storytelling, see the bottom of this page.</i></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What is College of Wizardry?</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A magical universe</h3>
<p>College of Wizardry is a contemporary magical realism fantasy story universe, where the participants populate the world in real, live events. At its core is a beloved live action role-playing game series that has run 20 main events so far at Czocha castle in Poland.</p>
<p>And there is a whole ecosystem of countless of fan items, art and spin-off events. Most importantly, thousands of players and volunteers create their own magical characters, make costumes and props and bring them to life together! This is real magic of love!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A few words about earlier fundraisers</h3>
<p>College of Wizardry fundraisers are some of the most successful larp-related campaigns on Indiegogo. First the very early larps at Czo<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551482162/nkhnheoyz12vemtjuzas.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>cha. Then later to expand the experience into a German language spinoff. It is worth noting that the cancellations of College of Wizardry by the earlier organisers, was due to other factors than the sustainability of the events themselves. The original group had to the best of our understanding overextended their projects to a point where they lacked operational capital to continue. This fundraiser is trying to save something established, loved by so many enthusiasts around the world and to take it forward. We don't expect any hype about an amazingly new thing today. But a fantastic existing one we want to preserve. And instead we hope that you find this fair and serious and trust us to rebuild before we innovate and expand. We thing that the decent thing to do, is to try to first deliver on the promise to those who now hold tickets to cancelled events.<br/> </p>

Earlier this year all future events were cancelled, as the former organisers halted operations and let staff go. Despite being sold out, and despite all efforts to continue, they were overextended on too many productions, with insufficient funds to run these larps and other events, and no money for immediate refunds. College of Wizardry has been a labour of love and this is truly heartbreaking for so many.What are we trying to do? The plan is pretty straight forward. The company P is making a down payment on the castle and risking the investment to produce the events. If we can raise the minimum funds for the events this Spring, we will open the doors again for anyone to go to magic school. We are determined to Save College of Wizardry and hope the magic will prevail!Who are behind this? With the help of some remarkably dedicated and passionate fans and creatives, the International Emmy Award Winning immersive storytelling studio The company P has taken on College of Wizardry to save this magical community. See special thanks and a presentation of the group and the bottom of this page. This page is put together under extreme pressure for all involved creatives, so please let us know if anything is unclear or not right. Email us with any questions.Why will we succeed? We are doing this together with the artists and players who have made College of Wizardry in to what it is over the years. P is a well-established production company with its day-to-day business from making television series and massively immersive events and campaigns. It's an incorporated business with a proven production pipeline and international partnerships. Nearly all of its creatives over the years also have one foot firmly in larping. We are setting aside a minimum of 100 000€ in the first phase to ensure College of Wizardry prevails, including a 20 000€ down payment on Czocha castle so that it's reserved for the April events, and an additional 20 000€ for event costs in arrear for the German language event ""Nibelungen"", hosted earlier this year. This is done ahead of this campaign and funded separately. And we are giving free ticket vouchers to the several hundred current ticket-holders that are left stranded. We are serious about Saving College of Wizardry. But we need your help to get started! See more about P and our work at the end of this page.We act fast or the magic school may be closed for years, or may never be able to open again! Our aim is to get as near to our funding goal as possible. And the better we do, the sooner tickets will be available again for anyone to go to future events.P collaborates with USC Games and Avalon Larp Studio to explore playable source material. See our alpha-tester perks!⇣______________________________Page content1.

Why are we doing this?
""We love this world and the people in it!""
We love College of Wizardry. There is probably no other experience that has introduced so many people world-wide to larping (from contemporary magic fiction and Harry Potter buffs, to passionate larpers). It has employed and trained amateur organisers, volunteers, professionals and hobby crafters and artists. And while the venture grew too big for the earlier organisers, the larp itself is strong, quirky and amazing. It is probably the most vibrant contemporary magic larp and story universe out there.
""It has changed my life in ways I never expected, giving me an international family of fantastic people, and has even become part of what I do for a living.""
– Liselle Awwal
 
For all non-magic graduates out there
College of Wizardry is a magical story universe, where the participants populate the world in real, live events. At its core, a beloved live action role-playing series (so called ""larps"", think cosplay with make-believe) about a magic school that has run 20 main events so far at Czocha castle in Poland.
We make costumes, wands and mystical artefacts, write stories and create characters–and generally behave as if we can do magic. Of course it's all really an excuse to be humans together (or non-humans)! 

wizardry.college 
If we don't, there may be no coming back
""It is vital to continue now""
Without this fundraiser, College of Wizardry may be unable to rebuild, or may need years to open the doors again. But if we can run the cancelled events in Spring, we ensure there is a future and can make tickets available for more players to experience the magic. So by helping these stranded people, we help reopen College of Wizardry for everyone!
Aside from being unfair to the players, an extended break also threatens the availability of the fantastic castle location in the future. And a pause will seriously impact the event production side (as the props and production pipeline would have to be partly rebuilt from scratch). As it stands now, College of Wizardry has both gear and crew ready to go. We are going to rehire all these talented people and make the events happen.

2.The Fundraiser
 
Coming together to make this work
 
Our goal is to reopen College of Wizardry by first making the events in April possible, open the November event ticket sales, and from there bring more magical experiences and commission more amazing talents, showing this magical reality to the world!
 
Is there a deadline?
Yes and no. The sooner, the better for all players, the crew and castle preparations. We’ll keep fighting all the way, seek investors and sponsors.
 
The first donations
Every little bit helps, and tells the World that College of Wizardry is determined to live on. So any support is dearly appreciated, pledge as little or as much you like. Or just spread the word? Check out the special perks displayed on the right side on this campaign page with unique art and items donated by College of Wizardry supporters. Including limited items to keep as a personal memory, or to publicly show your support.
Any contribution will be invested in full, earmarked to rebuild College of Wizardry and run events. All contributions help to preserve College of Wizardry over time, but we would love to reopen the doors now. That is our first goal, not just to help those players, but because that is the first stepping stone to preserve College of Wizardry!

About our perks
All items are created and donated at no cost by professional artists, writers and crafters from the community. Aside from hard costs (printing and manufacturing, postal service, and Indiegogo and other fees), the entire contribution goes to preserve College of Wizardry. The prize for some items is much lower than comparative retail cost. For some it is higher, as this is a charitable fundraiser. We are also going to offer ticket vouchers, these are at latest price level, with a little added to pay for Indiegogo and banking fees and for this fundraiser. By getting that perk you support Save College of Wizardry and get at reserved and paid spot!
We sincerely hope you like our perks and support what we do.
 
Examples of perks that show You helped Save College of Wizardry!

Signed Magical Certificate(A signed personal certificate showing you helped save College of Wizardry)


Medal of Magic Saviour(In-story medal for heroic magic, a true friend of magical schools)

 

What if we can't raise all the money?
If we fail to raise all the funds, things will take longer, maybe years, but College of Wizardry will reopen its doors! With Indiegogo flexible funding, every contribution will be invested in full, earmarked specifically to rebuild College of Wizardry and run events in the future. All contributions help preserve College of Wizardry over time, and the more we get the faster we get there.

 
The immediate needs
What does the College of Wizardry need right now to survive? To run the upcoming events, to reaffirm the relationship with the community and with Czocha castle. Before this happens, no major investor will back the IP, and it would be hard to say if the players would come back. But if we reopen the doors now, we are confident we can keep them open.
""Unfortunately it's not like we can just go to some goblin bank–those don't really exist in this world.""
Regardless of the outcome of this fundraiser, P is giving free ticket vouchers for future events to all current ticket-holders, but better yet would be to run the events as originally intended. To enable this crowdfunding campaign, P makes a down payment to Czocha castle of twenty thousand Euro, which means the incredible location is booked and reserved for College of Wizardry to happen on the original dates!
How will your contributions be invested?The goal is to immediately reopen College of Wizardry for witches and wizards. To preserve it so it can stand on its own legs again. One of the most important uses of the contributions is to be able to rehire Lead Producer Robin Steen, Iryt and the crew and freelancers for the 2019 events. The entire team is ready to go, with full support from P. After making good towards the crew, we would also like to commission some amazing talent and experts to support them.
In a nutshell, by running these events we ensure College of Wizardry is in good shape moving forward. We can reopen ticket sales and from there it's a matter of bringing more magic to more people, better, sooner and more fantastic!
All in all about half of the funding needs this year are the Indiegogo campaign for the April events and related costs. The other half is development investments by The company P to preserve College of Wizardry, funded outside this crowdfunding campaign.

As a reference, a high-level budget for the 2019 April events and costs for the first phase of reconstructing College of Wizardry is estimated to include Indiegogo and bank fees, conversion costs et cetera ca 10 000€, Location, set & props etc, castle rent, food, consumables ca 65 000€, Documentation, character photographs and other services ca 10 000€, Busses, transportation, other ca 15 000€.
See more on our Long term plan at the end of this page

 
⇣

The whole point of this fundraiser is to save College of Wizardry and make it available to the World again. To make that a reality, contributions will first go directly to pay for castle rent, food and other consumables, staff and freelancers, set dressing, costume, gear, travel and transportation et cetera to run the events in Spring. If we manage that, College of Wizardry will reopen its doors. The events in Fall will open for new players, and we will have preserved the magic for the future!

There are numerous crafters and artist supporting the College of Wizardry events. We would like to offer more commissioned work this year to all these brilliant creatives. Naturally, the art and work on all perks for the campaign are donated freely.
The raised funds would go to freelancers to take College of Wizardry forward. Especially we are looking to bring on some of the stellar Polish professionals that know College of Wizardry like no other, including the brilliant Agata Swistak who is attached as Assistant Producer.

One awesome part of this stretch goal is that we have invited the incredible artist Toshi Salvino (Dollfille) from the US to College of Wizardry! Toshi is offering her amazing work for free, and will help guide the NPC makeup crew in makeup and mask. She will also join the event as a special character, written by Freja Gyldenstrøm–a magically animated living doll inhabiting in the castle during Magic & Mischief! This would be Toshi's return to larping from when she was younger, and we couldn't be prouder to welcome her to the witchard family!

Here's a feature in New York Magazine about Toshi and her friends. P had the absolute pleasure of working with Toshi at Sleep No More for the Unknown 9 launch during New York ComicCon, and we are totally in love with her work! Her work and magical participation will be documented especially by brilliant Jeremy Caldwell.

Bring sorcery wherever you go with Magic Study Books, with maker-tips and playable content and lore. Take these beautiful books to magical courses at College of Wizardry or other magical schools. If we manage to raise the extra funds, we will begin to commission artists and writers (both professional and fans), and develop a growing set of on-demand student books.
Note that all source material would also be readily available to players online for free.
Playable Study Books on various topics (source and rules books made in-game, such as spells and magical history)
Exclusive House Books (with hidden mysteries and mini-quests)
Faculty Class Books (with DYI labs, presentations and teaching assets, lore student tests, as well as mini-quests between classes)

We all imagine that magical market hidden behind ancient stone walls and secret library passage ways. We like to populate it with all the fan creators out there. We like to support and grow the vibrant online community of crafters and small businesses that provide players with wands, wardrobe and more. And give them a permanent in-game place at events. The castle yard is perfect for travelling merchants of magic putting up tents and wagons. To boost the fan creations that are such an important part of College of Wizardry, we like to create an actual ""coin"". As extra flavour. Online pre-sales on people's Etsy etc would of course continue. Needless to say the coin would work as a voucher at the tavern! We've created tens of thousands of fantasy coins and sci-fi tokes for larps before and know the process.
""Witchard"" is a gender neutral name for a spell caster,coined by the College of Wizardry community.

We would like to commission Horseradish Studio, the incredibly talented group behind much of our documentation and the Save College of Wizardry! video here on Indiegogo.
We will show the evolution of this world of magic over all these years, and the start of the next chapter in this living saga. The team will follow the rebuilding, interview fans and crew, and create a short-form professional documentary about the magical world we all helped save. The College of Wizardry has garnished press impressions in the hundreds of millions internationally, and is likely the most widely publicised larp in history.
Watch their latest documentary (110 000+ views so far). And here is their stunning reel ⇢​

Launching the 2020 events
Launching future events is of course one thing we will definitely do further down the line. But with enough support from fans and the public to help College of Wizardry get through 2019, we can start thinking about the future now. And develop and launch larp events for next year and onward.
This will be done in dialogue with player advisory groups, veterans and newbies willing to give advice, and in conversation with the many stellar larp organisers out there.
Our aim is to continue the classic larps. We would also like to explore doing special events and storylines for player groups perhaps not yet included fully. Such as cuter, friendlier playful events for children of all ages. Or the darker, rawer consequences of spell casting for seekers of the horrifying. Inclusiveness, such as ethnicity, language and accessibility and gender would also be expanded. We know there is a feminist event designed with ticket sales started but postponed, that we would like to revive, with the original creators.

 
Example of a truly grand perk!

Thoughts on the long-term plan
We want to bring the College of Wizardry to the rest of the world. To take the magic to new fans and more places.
""It's time to kick in some doors and make the entertainment industry embrace the incredible warmth, intimacy and creativity of larping! We know both Hollywood and Magicwood, and its high time to let the beings of both mingle.""
– Christopher Sandberg, Founder P
P will create a professional concept video reel and look book. This will involve many creatives from College of Wizardry for commissioned work, along with leading industry creatives. P will set up pitch calls with investors, agents, studios, networks and streamers. With the aim to see how the magic can expand to a larger audience of non-larper and larpers alike, set in this fantastic story universe.
P has created, produced and collaborated on several award-winning prime-time drama series and transmedia productions, all including immersive theatre and larp events. P has also worked for several years advising one of the largest theme park operators in the world, on the development of participatory experiences. P Directed and Produced the global immersive launch event for Unknown 9, with Sleep No More and McKittrick hotel in New York, together with Cirque du Soleil founder's immersive company Reflector Entertainment. This garnished over one hundred million press impressions world-wide and is nominated for the Shorty Awards in ""Best use of Storytelling"".
Note: None of this would in any way intrude on the privacy and immersion of the larps. These will remain a safe-haven and the heart of the College of Wizardry world.
The company P is estimating it will invest ca 100 000€ in the first phase (on things such as insurance, legal fees, and development for investors and partners to come in and support). This is funded outside the Indiegogo campaign and should extra support come in it first goes go to creative commissions for development and presentation materials et cetera to the community and freelancers and professionals (see Stretch goals).
This includes getting it ready for major investor support, with the aim to set up a dedicated College of Wizardry company. This company is one we hope to run with and be owned in part by the community. As this would be quite a complex international set up, it will take time to figure out and to make sure that it is professionally managed, so that the situation it is in now isn't repeated.
To that end an analysis, business plan, investment white paper, creative brief and project pitches will be professionally produced. Brought to international event partners and entertainment and culture investors and funds, with the vision to collaborate with others to bring College of Wizardry to more people. This may include translations to other languages, establishing in other countries and on new continents, and reaching other demographics such as families and kids.

Sales partners
Research and academia partners
Agents
Transmedia and game expansions
Expansions into new markets and language translations

P wants to preserve College of Wizardry and also try to let more people experience the magic, and we are confident we can secure funding over time. Moving forward, we would seek international partnerships not only for development funding, sales and publishing, and event production, but also to explore possible formats for expanding the universe into storytelling accessible to more people (such as a participatory drama series). We have direct relationships with all major networks and streamers, with many years of awarded productions in our portfolio.
The company P Founder Christopher Sandberg is a returning juror to several leading international funds for participatory storytelling in Europe and North America, with experience from funding many tens of millions of dollars in projects. As an example of such ventures, P produced the Emmy-nominated Conspiracy For Good, created with Tim Kring (Heroes, Treadstone), where we worked with Nokia to raise funds to build several libraries in Zambia, Africa, together with Room To Read, stocking them with books, giving scholarships to girls, and create awareness about literacy. We feel we can give College of Wizardry expertise and care, and are honoured for the opportunity to support this community. For more on P's work in participatory storytelling, see the bottom of this page.
Please look at some of P's work at the end of this page if you are curious about what we do.

3.About College of Wizardry
 
What is College of Wizardry?
 
A magical universe
College of Wizardry is a contemporary magical realism fantasy story universe, where the participants populate the world in real, live events. At its core is a beloved live action role-playing game series that has run 20 main events so far at Czocha castle in Poland.
And there is a whole ecosystem of countless of fan items, art and spin-off events. Most importantly, thousands of players and volunteers create their own magical characters, make costumes and props and bring them to life together! This is real magic of love!

A few words about earlier fundraisers
College of Wizardry fundraisers are some of the most successful larp-related campaigns on Indiegogo. First the very early larps at Czocha. Then later to expand the experience into a German language spinoff. It is worth noting that the cancellations of College of Wizardry by the earlier organisers, was due to other factors than the sustainability of the events themselves. The original group had to the best of our understanding overextended their projects to a point where they lacked operational capital to continue. This fundraiser is trying to save something established, loved by so many enthusiasts around the world and to take it forward. We don't expect any hype about an amazingly new thing today. But a fantastic existing one we want to preserve. And instead we hope that you find this fair and serious and trust us to rebuild before we innovate and expand. We thing that the decent thing to do, is to try to first deliver on the promise to those who now hold tickets to cancelled events.

4.About us doing this campaign
 
Who are we and why should you trust us?The ""Save College of Wizardry!"" Indiegogo fundraiser campaign is done by The company P and fans. The non-profit larp organisation Liveform is attached to maintain a current Credits List of all official donors and supporters, creatives, staff, volunteers and participants.And very importantly, we have the full support of our magical main location Czocha castle. P has made a down payment of 20K€ for the events in April (which means the castle is booked and reserved for College of Wizardry). An agreement for 2019 and onward is made, with some details still under negotiation in good faith. We like to extend a special thanks to Bożena Stypczyc.Photo credits Przemysław Jendroska, Maciek Nitka, Iulian Dinu, Adam Jędrysik, Christina Molbech, Petr Luba, Kamil Wędzicha, Kaja Skorzyńska, Aleksander Krzystyniak, John-Paul Bichard, Liselle Awwal, Abi Laurel, Toivo Voll, Zuzanna Marzec, Jeremy Caldwell, Defy Gravity and more.Additional invaluable help and advice from Nadina Dobrowolska and colleagues at Horseradish Studio.

P has helped create two International Emmy Award Winning productions and received numerous other awards and nominations, including two Banff Awards, and is listed in WIRED as pioneering transmedia storytelling. The company P sponsored the Nordic Larp book (PDF link, edited by Jaakko Stenros and Markus Montola), which also feature several of our productions both in larping and transmedia. Its founders and staff have been part of creating several well-known larps over the years, including Trenne Byar (Three Villages), Hamlet, Dragonbane and Monitor Celestra; together with experience and larp producers such as Odyssé/Participation Design Agency and Alternaliv. Several tabletop roleplaying productions, including helping with the strategy for the Romeo and Juliette TRPG together with the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The very first larp at the Royal Dramatic Stage, and the global launch of Unknown 9 as larp and immersive theatre with Sleep No More and Reflector Entertainment (founded by Guy Laliberté, creator of Cirque du Soleil). As well as individually held positions of trust on the board of Sverok (national youth organisation of larpers, roleplayers, cosplay and gaming), as course creator and professor on larp and participatory storytelling at Stockholm Academy of Dramatic Arts, and as returning jurors for the Canadian Media Fund (CMF) and the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. The company P has participated in raising several million Euro for participatory experiences, notably with the European Broadcasting Union, Swedish development funds, and one of Europe's largest integrated research projects on pervasive gaming (IPerG, totalling an estimated 9M€ budget). P has created stories and experiences with many leading creatives, including Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Avengers), Tim Kring (Heroes, Treadstone), Craig Wright (Lost, Greenleaf) and involving support form and stellar talent of such luminaries as Andre Gregory, JJ Abrams, Hayden Panettieri, Zachary Quito, Joss Stone, Mat Osman (Suede), Dave Stewart (Eurythmics) and Ringo Starr.  P Founder and Chief Creative Christopher Sandberg (IMdB, LinkedIn) contributed as a player to the first two ever College of Wizardry larps, as Professor of Magical Artefacts ""Orethisius Pewtermain Miclariotic"", crafting an Artefactorium for the castle library. Photo credit John-Paul BichardFor more on the Artefactorium, see College of Wizardry: The Magic of Participation in Harry Potter Larps (PDF link), edited by Jaakko Stenros and Marcus Montola, p. 127.Sandberg also researched, designed, edited and wrote large parts of, and helped to finance the print of the very first 200 pages student study book The Eternal Guide to the Disciplines of Magic (PDF link), which included hidden clues and lore for most classes. Briefly about the assignment of rights and ownershipThe company P has acquired College of Wizardry in its entirety from the former owners (including without limitation Nibelungen and other special editions and events). Because of the complex international nature, some details to be defined in good faith, with respect to all involved over the years. The purchase involves a royalty to DLS and to Liveform as an independent non-profit organisation to distribute to creatives with any surplus to support Polish larping. In addition a future buyout cost at fair market value, also split between DLS and Liveform.P is not affiliated with the former organisers; any partnership and/or liability is expressly disclaimed. All rights reserved. None of the funds raised go to DLS, founder Claus Raasted or its owners. All funds earmarked outside P's day-to-day business, to rebuild College of Wizardry and run the cancelled events, if possible on the dates originally intended.To make sure credits and mentioning of the people involved over the years is done correctly, Liveform to maintain a Credits List and the distribution of any royalty to originators. We are working very hard to make sure this is handled right, and with respect for the international teams of volunteers and work for hire at former organisers and collaborators. We are continuing in good faith to collect names and people's involvement. If you have contributed as volunteer, staff or otherwise, please contact us.In the short term, P is giving free ticket vouchers to several hundred old ticket-holders (equivalent value of ca 500€/voucher) and offers our work for free for 2019. In addition, to make this crowdfunding campaign possible, P makes a non-refundable down payment for the castle of 20K€. P has in addition made a payment in arrear on location services of 15K€, as well as a 20K€ payment for castle services for recent College of Wizardry German language event Nibelungen.Our long-term goal would be to find investors and if possible set up a dedicated College of Wizardry corporation in such a way that the community can help run and own a part of it. We are preparing to set up creative commons/licensing to protect all fan creators and small businesses, to enable art, crafting, spinn offs and such to continue and grow.We like to mention Philipp Jacobius, who has worked tirelessly to traverse all administrative hurdles, and Claus Raasted, who in the face of great adversity has shown incredible dedication to find a home for College of Wizardry. While we respect the differing views on how things may have reached such an unsustainable situation, it is clear to us that everyone is working very hard to solve it.______________________________________________ And one more mention, to all of you who support College of Wizardry!

<h3>What we're all about</h3>
<p>Let's get personal: this is a one-woman show! My name is Cait and books have helped shape my life. After recently dealing with a personal tragedy, I've decided that it's time for me to focus my energy on something positive--especially during this very divisive time in our country. And so the idea of Required Reading was born! So much progress has been made with the development of this project, and we're getting close to making it a reality. Your contribution will help us put the finishing touches on a business that is sure to make a difference.</p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>Required Reading will be a monthly subscription service emphasizing small + independent publishers. Subscribers sign up and can pay monthly to receive a new book, beautifully wrapped, sent to their door each month. Beyond the month-to-month service, subscribers can also prepay to receive a 3-month, 6-month, or 12-month subscription at discounted rates. Not an avid reader? We also think our subscription service will make a great gift for the bibliophile in your life! </p>

Sono richiesti diversi lavori di ristrutturazione e interventi di messa a norma necessari per poter aprire al pubblico. I nostri soci volontari si sono già dati disponibili per eseguire i lavori più semplici, ma occorre un intervento da parte di professionisti specializzati. Infatti <strong>lo Studio Sossai di San Lazzaro di Savena si è già messo al lavoro per ristrutturare gli infissi, la pavimentazione, imbiancare le pareti, rifare la balaustra delle scale e via dicendo.</strong></p><p>Nb: i concept sono indicativi e che il risultato finale potrebbe essere diverso da quello proposto. </p><p> </p><p><i><strong>IL PROGETTO</strong></i></p><p><strong>Per poter toccare un sogno, servono menti creative e abili mani per realizzarlo</strong>. Per questo motivo ci affidiamo all’artista <strong>Ivan Cavini </strong>(illustratore, già creative director del Greisinger Museum e direttore artistico di FantastikA), che abbiamo l’onore di annoverare tra i nostri soci fondatori, oltre allo <strong>Studio Sossai</strong> di cui conosciamo la professionalità e l’esperienza nel settore scenografico.</p><p>Il centro studi si articolerà su tre piani: al piano interrato ci saranno la biblioteca, e la sala conferenze, che sarà anche lo spazio dedicato ai workshop. Al piano terra, si troveranno il bookshop e l’ingresso del museo. Al primo piano infine ci saranno le sale espositivo/museali e i servizi.</p><p><strong>La Tana del Drago sarà allestita in modo da dare l’idea ai visitatori di aprire la porta e trovarsi catapultati nella letteratura fantastica</strong>: ci saranno arredamenti che andranno da un rustico stile Fantasy, a uno gotico-medievale.

Serviranno sedie e tavoli per la sala conferenze, teche di vetro per la galleria espositiva, un bancone in stile fantasy per il bookshop, librerie per la biblioteca e cornici per esporre le opere d’arte. <strong>Infine, per meglio immergerci nell’atmosfera fantastica, vorremmo realizzare almeno tre sculture: una creatura negativa che si aggirerà tra le teche, un Pastore di alberi che osserverà le scale e un demone che sorvegli la galleria.</strong> Inoltre, anche se tra noi abbiamo moltissimi soci volenterosi, ci servirà comunque l’aiuto di alcuni professionisti per curare il settore comunicazione: teniamo così tanto a questo progetto che vogliamo realizzarlo al meglio in ogni sua parte!</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Stretch Goal: il viaggio del Drago!</strong></h3><p>La strada per la vetta è lunga: per questo abbiamo stabilito diversi obiettivi per il viaggio del nostro Drago.

</h2><p><strong>We are AIST a cultural association devoted to the study and the diffusion of the works of Inklings</strong>. Our roots date back to 2005, when, for the first time, a group of friends met in Rome to talk about fantasy literature. Since then we have grown, inspired by the common passion for English writers – not to mention the food, as it is only natural for the fan inside us – and today we have members and friends all over Italy.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523267448/dbggdi2ynnf8japnku6o.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The love for the Professor’s books has led us to delve also into the secondary literature works centred on Inklings' works: we are interested in literary criticism, movies and comics, but we also love board and video games, music and art. <strong>Among us there are scholars,</strong> <strong>writers,</strong> <strong>critics</strong> <strong>and artists, but also simple enthusiasts brought together by a genuine desire to share a common passion.</strong></p><p><strong>We write and translate books</strong>, we hold courses and presentations; we organise conferences in universities (among the guests of the last one, held <strong>at the University of Trento</strong> in December 2018, we are proud <strong>to</strong> <strong>mention</strong> <strong>Tom</strong> <strong>Shippey</strong>, the most important Tolkienian scholar of all time) and participate in <strong>leisure and cultural events</strong> dedicated to literature. Among the projects closest to our heart you can find several series of essays, an innovative series of little books focused on Inklings, a calendar created by masters of Italian fantasy art.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525380073/sfjmbi7dderlofy2ovgl.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Now the time has arrived to make a dream come true: to build a place where all those who love Middle-earth can feel at home and touch that world with their hands, gathering from every part of the world!</strong> Dwarves, Elves and Wizards will be able to meet under the wings of the Dragon, to explore together all the paths that Fantasy discloses.</p><p> </p><h3>

Two is enough to make a toast, but the more we are the more exciting the party will be. <strong><i>The Dragon’s Lair</i> will be a library, a treasure chest, and a tavern where to meet in the evening and tell stories sitting by the fireplace​!</strong></p><p> </p><h3>
<strong>We</strong> <strong>need</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>help!</strong>
</h3><p> </p><p><i><strong>HOW IT IS/HOW IT WILL BECOME</strong></i></p><p>Thanks to the municipal corporation of Dozza we have found a suitable building: a period house uninhabited for some years which therefore needs refurbishment and safety works to comply with the regulations before opening to the public. Our volunteers, mostly members of the Association, have already started performing the most basic works, but we need intervention by specialised professionals. In fact, <strong>the Studio Sossai of San Lazzaro di Savena has already started working to renovate the fixtures,</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>flooring, to paint the walls, to redo the stairs banisters</strong> <strong>and so on.</strong></p><p>Nb: the concepts are indicative and that the final result could be different from the one proposed.</p><p> </p><p><i><strong>THE PROJECT</strong></i></p><p><strong>In order</strong> <strong>to touch a dream, you need</strong> <strong>creative minds and</strong> <strong>capable hands to make it come true</strong>. For this reason we rely on artist <strong>Ivan Cavini</strong> (illustrator, former creative director of Greisinger Museum and artistic director of FantastikA), whom we are honoured to count among our founding members, and on <strong>Studio Sossai</strong>, whose professionalism and experience in the theatrical field are very well known.</p><p>The study centre will consist of three floors: in the basement there will be the library and the conference room, which will also hosts the workshops. On the ground floor you will find the bookshop and the museum entrance and finally, on the first floor, there will be the exhibition/museum rooms and the restrooms.</p><p><strong><i>The Dragon’s Lair</i> will be decorated in such a way as to give the visitors the idea to open a door and be drawn into Fairyland. </strong> Furniture will range from rustic style to medieval-Gothic, sculptures of fantastic characters will enliven the rooms, and of course you will find a round door at the entrance.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525278202/ee5iki03u9gv7qhtwyzy.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Since we want the Dragon’s Lair to be the home of us all, you too must be part of it!</strong> As you will discover reading what the various perks are, you can become part of the project by supporting us during the crowdfunding.

Chairs and tables are needed for the conference room, glass cases for exhibition gallery, a Hobbit-style counter for the bookshop, shelves for the library and frames to exhibit works of art. <strong>Finally, to enhance the ‘Fantasy immersion factor’, we would like to create at least three sculptures: evil creature that wanders between the display cases, an Trees' Shepard that watches the stairs and a</strong> <strong>demon guarding the gallery.</strong> Moreover, although we do have many willing partners among us, we will still need the help of some professionals to take care of the communication sector: we care so much about this project that we want to make it the best in each and every part!</p><p> </p><h3>

Le nostre radici affondano nel lontano 2005, quando un gruppo di amici si riunì per la prima volta in quel di Roma per parlare delle opere del Professore oxoniense. Da allora siamo cresciuti, animati dalla comune passione per il Fantasy (e per il cibo, come insegna ogni creatura fantastica) e oggi abbiamo soci e amici sparsi in tutta Italia.L’amore per i libri del Professore ci ha portato ad occuparci anche delle opere secondarie da questi derivati: ci occupiamo di critica letteraria, film, fumetti, ma adoriamo anche giochi da tavolo e videogiochi, musica e arte. Tra di noi ci sono studiosi, scrittori, critici e artisti, ma anche semplici appassionati legati dalla volontà di condividere la nostra passione con tutti coloro che ne sono attratti.Scriviamo e traduciamo libri, teniamo corsi e presentazioni; organizziamo convegni nelle Università (tra gli ospiti dell’ultimo convegno, tenutosi all’Università di Trento nel dicembre 2018, annoveriamo con orgoglio Tom Shippey, il massimo studioso di sempre) e partecipiamo ad eventi ludici e a manifestazioni culturali dedicate al mondo della letteratura. Tra i progetti che più ci stanno a cuore potete trovare collane di saggistica, un’innovativa collana dedicata alle lingue di Elfi e Nani e un calendario artistico realizzato dai maestri del fantasy italiano.Ora è giunto il momento di realizzare un sogno: costruire un luogo dove tutti coloro che amano il Fantasy possano sentirsi a casa e toccarla con mano, radunandosi da ogni parte del mondo! Umani, Nani, Elfi e Stregoni potranno così riunirsi insieme sotto le ali del Drago, per scoprire insieme tutte le strade che la Fantasia apre. La Tana del DragoDOVE: Dozza, in provincia di Bologna.Un affascinante borgo medievale posto su una collina e dominato da un’imponente Rocca sforzesca, a pochi passi dalla città universitaria di Bologna. Qui organizziamo ogni due anni FantastikA, un evento tutto dedicato all’arte e alla cultura del fantastico.COSA: La Tana del Drago è un progetto no-profit e sarà una casa per tutti coloro che sono attratti dal mondo creato dalla penna degli Inklings, una fucina di idee inesauribile e pronta all’accoglienza. La Tana del Drago non è autorizzato dalla Tolkien Estate e non ha alcuna associazione con la Tolkien Estate o la famiglia Tolkien.Abbiamo scelto questo nome perché il drago rappresenta da sempre il genere fantasy, perché a pochi metri dal centro studi, all’interno della bellissima rocca di Dozza c’è un vero drago che riposa, rannicchiato tra le sue immense ali, e perché La tana del Drago deve diventare un luogo accogliente dove ritrovare gli amici e sentirsi al sicuro!

Museo: il primo museo dedicato al fantastico in Italia. Ci sarà uno spazio dedicato ad un’esposizione permanente, e uno alle mostre temporanee, dove potremo invitare artisti provenienti da tutto il mondo

Centro Studi: un luogo pensato per stimolare e incoraggiare la ricerca e gli studi sul fantastico, mettendo a disposizione degli studiosi tutto ciò di cui avranno bisogno, grazie anche alla biblioteca che vogliamo allestire. Organizzeremo convegni con studiosi, sia invitando chi già si è affermato in campo internazionale, sia mantenendo un occhio di riguardo verso i giovani che si affacciano in questo mondo

Laboratorio: uno spazio dedicato a corsi e workshop, partendo da un livello base pensato per chi ha da poco messo piede nella letteratura fantastica, per arrivare a un livello specialistico per chi vuole approfondire le proprie conoscenze

Bookshop: tutto a tema fantastico, vi si potranno trovare libri, opere d’arte, oggetti di artigianato unici e pezzi da collezione. Vogliamo che chiunque passi a trovarci possa trovare gemme naniche nate dalla cura e dalla passione.
PERCHÉ: Crediamo che l’Immaginazione, l’Arte e la Letteratura abbiano un potere tanto grande da smuovere le montagne, e che l’Amicizia sia ancora più forte: è questa che permette ai nostri sogni di diventare realtà. D’altronde, per brindare bisogna essere in due, ma più si è e più bella sarà la festa. La Tana del Drago sarà insieme biblioteca, scrigno di tesori e taverna dove riunirsi la sera per narrare storie intorno al fuoco! Ci serve il vostro aiuto!COM’È/COME SARA’Grazie al Comune di Dozza abbiamo trovato l’edificio adatto, una palazzina disabitata da qualche anno. Sono richiesti diversi lavori di ristrutturazione e interventi di messa a norma necessari per poter aprire al pubblico. I nostri soci volontari si sono già dati disponibili per eseguire i lavori più semplici, ma occorre un intervento da parte di professionisti specializzati. Infatti lo Studio Sossai di San Lazzaro di Savena si è già messo al lavoro per ristrutturare gli infissi, la pavimentazione, imbiancare le pareti, rifare la balaustra delle scale e via dicendo.Nb: i concept sono indicativi e che il risultato finale potrebbe essere diverso da quello proposto.  IL PROGETTOPer poter toccare un sogno, servono menti creative e abili mani per realizzarlo. Per questo motivo ci affidiamo all’artista Ivan Cavini (illustratore, già creative director del Greisinger Museum e direttore artistico di FantastikA), che abbiamo l’onore di annoverare tra i nostri soci fondatori, oltre allo Studio Sossai di cui conosciamo la professionalità e l’esperienza nel settore scenografico.Il centro studi si articolerà su tre piani: al piano interrato ci saranno la biblioteca, e la sala conferenze, che sarà anche lo spazio dedicato ai workshop. Al piano terra, si troveranno il bookshop e l’ingresso del museo. Al primo piano infine ci saranno le sale espositivo/museali e i servizi.La Tana del Drago sarà allestita in modo da dare l’idea ai visitatori di aprire la porta e trovarsi catapultati nella letteratura fantastica: ci saranno arredamenti che andranno da un rustico stile Fantasy, a uno gotico-medievale. Sculture di personaggi fantastici animeranno le stanze e, naturalmente, all’entrata troverete una porta tonda.Siccome vogliamo che la Tana del Drago sia la casa di tutti noi, anche voi dovrete farne parte! Come scoprirete leggendo in cosa consistono i vari perk, potrete diventare parte della casa sostenendoci durante il crowdfunding: a seconda della vostra scelta, il vostro nome, o, a seconda dei casi, la vostra foto o il vostro ritratto verranno appesi permanentemente alle pareti della Tana del Drago.Se, grazie a voi, questo progetto andrà a buon fine, il 21 settembre durante la quarta edizione di Fantastika, la biennale d’arte del fantastico di Dozza, ci sarà l’apertura ufficiosa e l’inizio delle attività. Nei prossimi mesi vi daremo diverse anticipazioni sul programma della manifestazione e delle attività della Tana del Drago. Anche il fattore tempo è importante: l’obiettivo per settembre 2018 è quello di aprire gran parte del centro studi e con il vostro aiuto, dopo alcuni mesi potreste già veder nascere gli allestimenti scenografici a tema e le creature fantastiche!Tutto dipende da voi: più riusciremo a raccogliere insieme, più elaborate saranno le ambientazioni e le creature che animeranno la Tana del drago.I COSTIPer realizzare un simile sogno, i costi sono molto alti: come abbiamo accennato, abbiamo già iniziato la messa a norma dell’edificio ma avremo bisogno di arredamenti e allestimenti scenografico/espositivi, tutti in legno e in grado di creare suggestioni fantastiche. Serviranno sedie e tavoli per la sala conferenze, teche di vetro per la galleria espositiva, un bancone in stile fantasy per il bookshop, librerie per la biblioteca e cornici per esporre le opere d’arte. Infine, per meglio immergerci nell’atmosfera fantastica, vorremmo realizzare almeno tre sculture: una creatura negativa che si aggirerà tra le teche, un Pastore di alberi che osserverà le scale e un demone che sorvegli la galleria. Inoltre, anche se tra noi abbiamo moltissimi soci volenterosi, ci servirà comunque l’aiuto di alcuni professionisti per curare il settore comunicazione: teniamo così tanto a questo progetto che vogliamo realizzarlo al meglio in ogni sua parte! Stretch Goal: il viaggio del Drago!La strada per la vetta è lunga: per questo abbiamo stabilito diversi obiettivi per il viaggio del nostro Drago. Più ci aiuterete, più la Tana del Drago potrà essere un luogo magico e unico al mondo!

Per prenotarli, scriveteci un mail a questo indirizzo; noi aggiorneremo l'elenco con segnalando quelli già prenotati.SPEDIZIONITutto ciò che prevede una spedizione verrà spedito a partire da settembre 2018, dopo lo svolgimento di FantastikA. Qualsiasi perk sarà in ogni caso ritirabile gratuitamente a FantastikA; in quel caso, le spese di spedizione vi verranno rimborsate con un buono spendibile nel bookshop della Tana del Drago o sul sito dell’AIST (in fase di ultimazione) I rischi e la sfidaLe nostre braccia e il nostro cuore sono al servizio di questo sogno: ci manca soltanto il vostro aiuto! Se non dovessimo raggiungere il nostro obiettivo, voi riceverete comunque la ricompensa prevista per il perk scelto. La Tana del Drago però non vedrebbe la luce così come l’abbiamo sognata: senza i fondi, non ci sarà sicuramente possibile aprire nei tempi previsti. Tutto ciò che raccoglieremo andrà comunque destinato ai lavori di ristrutturazione, anche se significherebbe rallentarli fino a fermarli in attesa di qualche finanziamento. English version
Who are we
We are AIST a cultural association devoted to the study and the diffusion of the works of Inklings. Our roots date back to 2005, when, for the first time, a group of friends met in Rome to talk about fantasy literature. Since then we have grown, inspired by the common passion for English writers – not to mention the food, as it is only natural for the fan inside us – and today we have members and friends all over Italy.The love for the Professor’s books has led us to delve also into the secondary literature works centred on Inklings' works: we are interested in literary criticism, movies and comics, but we also love board and video games, music and art. Among us there are scholars, writers, critics and artists, but also simple enthusiasts brought together by a genuine desire to share a common passion.We write and translate books, we hold courses and presentations; we organise conferences in universities (among the guests of the last one, held at the University of Trento in December 2018, we are proud to mention Tom Shippey, the most important Tolkienian scholar of all time) and participate in leisure and cultural events dedicated to literature. Among the projects closest to our heart you can find several series of essays, an innovative series of little books focused on Inklings, a calendar created by masters of Italian fantasy art.Now the time has arrived to make a dream come true: to build a place where all those who love Middle-earth can feel at home and touch that world with their hands, gathering from every part of the world! Dwarves, Elves and Wizards will be able to meet under the wings of the Dragon, to explore together all the paths that Fantasy discloses. 
The Dragon’s Lair
WHERE: Dozza, near Bologna.A charming medieval village built on a hill and dominated by an imposing fortress of the House Sforza, a few miles away from the university town of Bologna. Here we organize FantastikA every two years, a festival entirely dedicated to fantasy culture and art. WHAT: “La Tana del Drago” (The Dragon’s Lair) is a no-profit project and will be a home for all those who love the world created by Inklings: at the same time a welcoming place for guests and a forge of countless ideas and projects. LA TANA DEL DRAGO/THE DRAGON’S LAIR is not licensed or authorised by the Tolkien Estate and has no association with the Tolkien Estate or the Tolkien family.We have chosen this name because the dragon has always represented the fantasy genre, because a few steps away from the study centre, just inside the beautiful castle of Dozza, there is a real dragon resting, huddled under its own huge wings, and because La Tana del Drago must become a welcoming haven where to find friends and feel safe!

Museum: the first museum devoted to Fantasy in Italy. There will be a space dedicated to a permanent exhibition and another for temporary exhibitions by guest artists from all around the world;

Study Centre: a place designed to stimulate and encourage research and studies about the Professor, providing the scholars with everything they need, also thanks to the library we want to create. We will organise conferences, inviting scholars of already established international fame, but also keeping an attentive eye on young people entering this world for the first time;

Laboratory: a space dedicated to courses and workshops, from basic levels designed for those who have just recently set foot in fantasy literature to advanced levels for those who want to improve their knowledge;

Bookshop: everything about english fantasy writers: books, works of art, unique handcrafted items and collectibles. We like to think that anyone coming to visit our Centre will find there Dwarvish gems born of care and passion!
WHY: Inspired mainly by reading Inklings' works, we do believe that Imagination, Art and Literature have the power to move mountains, and that Friendship is even stronger, being what really makes our dreams come true. Two is enough to make a toast, but the more we are the more exciting the party will be. The Dragon’s Lair will be a library, a treasure chest, and a tavern where to meet in the evening and tell stories sitting by the fireplace​! 
We need your help!
 HOW IT IS/HOW IT WILL BECOMEThanks to the municipal corporation of Dozza we have found a suitable building: a period house uninhabited for some years which therefore needs refurbishment and safety works to comply with the regulations before opening to the public. Our volunteers, mostly members of the Association, have already started performing the most basic works, but we need intervention by specialised professionals. In fact, the Studio Sossai of San Lazzaro di Savena has already started working to renovate the fixtures, the flooring, to paint the walls, to redo the stairs banisters and so on.Nb: the concepts are indicative and that the final result could be different from the one proposed. THE PROJECTIn order to touch a dream, you need creative minds and capable hands to make it come true. For this reason we rely on artist Ivan Cavini (illustrator, former creative director of Greisinger Museum and artistic director of FantastikA), whom we are honoured to count among our founding members, and on Studio Sossai, whose professionalism and experience in the theatrical field are very well known.The study centre will consist of three floors: in the basement there will be the library and the conference room, which will also hosts the workshops. On the ground floor you will find the bookshop and the museum entrance and finally, on the first floor, there will be the exhibition/museum rooms and the restrooms.The Dragon’s Lair will be decorated in such a way as to give the visitors the idea to open a door and be drawn into Fairyland.  Furniture will range from rustic style to medieval-Gothic, sculptures of fantastic characters will enliven the rooms, and of course you will find a round door at the entrance.Since we want the Dragon’s Lair to be the home of us all, you too must be part of it! As you will discover reading what the various perks are, you can become part of the project by supporting us during the crowdfunding. Depending on your choice, your name, your photo or your portrait will be permanently displayed on the walls of The Dragon’s Lair.If, thanks to your help, this project will be successful, on September 21st, during the fourth edition of FantastikA, the fantasy art festival taking place in Dozza every two years, there will be the “unofficial” opening of the Centre and the beginning of its activities. In the next few months we will give you several updates about the program of the event and the activities of the Dragon’s Lair. Timing is quite crucial: the goal for September 2018 is to open a large part of the study centre and, with your help, after a few months you will see artistic set-ups and fantastic creatures come into being!It all depends on you: the more we can collect together, the more elaborate the settings and the creatures that will animate The Dragon’s Lair will be.COSTSTo make such a dream come true, costs are very high. As we mentioned, we have already begun the safety works in the building, but we will need furniture and scenic/display installations, all in wood in order to suggest a fantasy environment. Chairs and tables are needed for the conference room, glass cases for exhibition gallery, a Hobbit-style counter for the bookshop, shelves for the library and frames to exhibit works of art. Finally, to enhance the ‘Fantasy immersion factor’, we would like to create at least three sculptures: evil creature that wanders between the display cases, an Trees' Shepard that watches the stairs and a demon guarding the gallery. Moreover, although we do have many willing partners among us, we will still need the help of some professionals to take care of the communication sector: we care so much about this project that we want to make it the best in each and every part! 
Stretch Goals: the journey of the Dragon!
The road to the top is long: this is why we have set progressive goals for the journey of our Dragon. The more you help us, the more the Dragon’s Lair can become a magical and unique place worldwide!

To book them, write us an email to this address, we will update the list with reporting those already booked.SHIPMENTSShipments will start in September 2018, after the conclusion of FantastikA. Any perk chosen will be  however available for picking up free of charge at FantastikA: in that case the shipping costs will be reimbursed with a voucher to spend at the Dragon’s Lair’s bookshop or on the website of Associazione Italiana Studi Tolkieniani (coming soon!). 
Risks & Challenges
We are very committed to this project, body and soul: we only need your help! Should we not achieve our goal, you will still receive your reward for the chosen perk, but The Dragon’s Lair will not see the light as we have dreamed it. Without sufficient funds, it will not be possible to open on schedule. In that case everything we collect will go to the renovation works, even if that means to slow them down while waiting for further funding.",19.0,0,"1 Campaign

This semi-staged performance of A Cambodian Magic Flute (CMF) is the result of two unprecedented artistic workshops bringing together Cambodian traditional musicians with a talented young Singaporean orchestra. The March performance of Mozart's masterpiece will be the first time a classic opera has ever been performed in Cambodia.Mozart’s much loved The Magic Flute — a universal tale of love and hope — is a cornerstone of the Western operatic tradition that can also lay claim to have been the first hit musical, enjoying an unprecedented run of over a hundred performances in its first year...Mozart at Angkor and Amrita Performing Arts are working together to bring this to pass, ultimately intending to present three performances using a 12th century temple as an incomparable backdrop. 5 reasons to give1) Contribute to Cambodia's cultural regeneration, after 40 years where culture and art has been crushed or stifled2) Be a pioneer in what will ultimately be a world historic event - the first opera ever staged in Cambodia, in the spectacular setting of Angkor Wat3) Be part of a project which allows Cambodian talent to flourish and develop their own artistic paths4) Support a Cambodian adaptation of a classic masterpiece which can become a regular part of the cultural calendar5) Show your support for culture as a regenerative force in post-conflict societiesWhy now?Cambodia is currently in the middle of major economic regeneration and recovery, but its culture still lags behind, still scarred after decades of civil war, much of which was aimed directly at art and artists. There have been notable NGOs which have worked hard to recover Cambodian traditional arts, and now is the time for them to rejoin the international cultural community, to the mutual benefit of all parties.Why this opera? Mozart's Die Zauberflöte, ""The Magic Flute"", is a story of the universal search for truth that cuts across national boundaries and beliefs.  The simple humanity of the story has clear parallels to the Reamker, the Cambodian version of the ancient Hindu Ramayana story and the most popular narrative in Cambodia.Cambodians of all ages and visitors from all over the world will be able to relate to the simple humanity of this story with its powerful mythological and allegorical content. One of the great musical creations of all time, Mozart’s enchanting Magic Flute has enduring international appeal.  Moreover, the opera’s quasi-religious morality has clear parallels with the Ramayana story and other elements of Hindu and Buddhist symbology. The entirely Asian-based artistic team will draw on these parallels as well as incorporate traditional Cambodian disciplines such as lakhoan bassac, lakhoan khaol and sbaek thom in the production. History of the projectA Cambodian Magic Flute was conceived as three distinct stages.1) Work began with a week of auditions in 2016 at the Royal University of Fine Arts allowing Robert Turnbull and the production team to see the extent of the talent and begin to make casting decisions. One year later a series of workshops brought an orchestra from Singapore together with local Cambodian musicians and singers.

<p>¡Hola! Somos Josymar Rodriguez y Stefan Gzyl, arquitectos y parte del equipo de Incursiones, iniciativa social que crea contenido y escenarios capaces de promover interacciones entre ciudadanos. Diseñamos y ponemos a prueba experiencias e intervenciones en el espacio público que muestran nuevas formas de agitar la cotidianidad promoviendo prácticas ciudadanas constructivas y la exploración de la ciudad.</p>
<p>En esta oportunidad, queremos poner a prueba cómo diferentes actores compartimos el espacio de la ciudad. La calle ha pasado de ser entendida como un espacio dedicado a mover vehículos a uno en el que interactúan diversos medios y velocidades, contribuyendo a una mayor riqueza de la experiencia urbana, mayor seguridad y beneficios económicos. Siguiendo el ejemplo de Bogotá, Copenhague o Nueva York, numerosas ciudades se han dedicado a cambiar el <i>status quo</i> sobre lo que se considera debe ser una calle. Igualmente, <strong>el ciudadano ha pasado de simple receptor a tener un rol activo, alguien que demanda y participa en el cambio.</strong> Esta dinámica ha abierto la puerta a numerosas iniciativas que se originan de abajo hacia arriba, exigiendo de instituciones gubernamentales otras actitudes hacia el espacio público. El diseño debe ser parte fundamental de cómo se abordan estos reclamos.</p>
<p>El tráfico de México es uno de los peores del mundo, lo que funcione en Ciudad de México puede funcionar donde sea. ¿Por qué CDMX? Entre el 17 y 20 de Marzo se celebrará Mextropoli 2018 y fuimos seleccionados para hacer una intervención urbana en el marco del festival. Este evento es único en nuestro continente y contará con la asistencia de más de 50.000 personas. El objetivo de nuestra intervención, ejecutada de la mano con los participantes, buscará promover la peatonalidad y reducir el impacto que el vehículo privado tiene sobre el espacio de la calle.</p>
<p>Ayúdanos a intervenir el suelo de una intersección del centro histórico de CDMX, un cruce en el que existen conflictos de movilidad. Nuestra idea es poner a prueba una estrategia de “camuflaje de deslumbramiento”, que no busca esconder sino desorientar, desarrollada durante la 1era Guerra Mundial y luego reinterpretada por el arte moderno. Nosotros la usaremos como una manera de hacer consciente a todos los usuarios de los estímulos del ambiente a partir de alterar su atención y su percepción del espacio, borrando las diferencias entre calzada, acera, rayados, etc., visibilizando por igual a todos los actores.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Objetivos</strong></p></li></ul>
<p>1. El poder del diseño. Demostrar que con recursos y materiales limitados se pueden producir intervenciones de alto impacto y calidad visual.</p>
<p>2. Poder del ciudadano. Demostrar la capacidad de organización del individuo para generar cambios en la ciudad.</p>
<p>3. Descontextualización: evidenciar cómo el cambiar la manera de ver nuestro entorno permite abrir nuevas posibilidades y formas de relacionarnos con este.</p>
<p>¡Se parte del grupo de ciudadanos activos, que como nosotros busca impulsar cambios en nuestras ciudades!</p>
<p> </p>

Esta dinámica ha abierto la puerta a numerosas iniciativas que se originan de abajo hacia arriba, exigiendo de instituciones gubernamentales otras actitudes hacia el espacio público. El diseño debe ser parte fundamental de cómo se abordan estos reclamos.
El tráfico de México es uno de los peores del mundo, lo que funcione en Ciudad de México puede funcionar donde sea. ¿Por qué CDMX? Entre el 17 y 20 de Marzo se celebrará Mextropoli 2018 y fuimos seleccionados para hacer una intervención urbana en el marco del festival. Este evento es único en nuestro continente y contará con la asistencia de más de 50.000 personas. El objetivo de nuestra intervención, ejecutada de la mano con los participantes, buscará promover la peatonalidad y reducir el impacto que el vehículo privado tiene sobre el espacio de la calle.
Ayúdanos a intervenir el suelo de una intersección del centro histórico de CDMX, un cruce en el que existen conflictos de movilidad. Nuestra idea es poner a prueba una estrategia de “camuflaje de deslumbramiento”, que no busca esconder sino desorientar, desarrollada durante la 1era Guerra Mundial y luego reinterpretada por el arte moderno. Nosotros la usaremos como una manera de hacer consciente a todos los usuarios de los estímulos del ambiente a partir de alterar su atención y su percepción del espacio, borrando las diferencias entre calzada, acera, rayados, etc., visibilizando por igual a todos los actores.
 
Objetivos
1. El poder del diseño. Demostrar que con recursos y materiales limitados se pueden producir intervenciones de alto impacto y calidad visual.
2. Poder del ciudadano. Demostrar la capacidad de organización del individuo para generar cambios en la ciudad.
3. Descontextualización: evidenciar cómo el cambiar la manera de ver nuestro entorno permite abrir nuevas posibilidades y formas de relacionarnos con este.
¡Se parte del grupo de ciudadanos activos, que como nosotros busca impulsar cambios en nuestras ciudades!

<h2><strong>Overview </strong></h2> <p>We are LVnTheLife! A Public Benefits Corporation aiming to empower the disabled, provide for the helpless, and give exposure to local artistic talent through digital engagement.  Local artists are always seeking a way to be exposed and find voice within the outskirts of their own community. We hope to broaden their horizons. We also want to give voice to the disabled, who are often neglected for their ability as artists in our community. We put on a show called “LView” to provide the support to reach our mission by interviewing artists of ATX and we have fun doing it! Thus far, we have done 3 seasons of LView and plan to continue the show through the spring totaling 7 seasons. But we need your help! </p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>Costs adding up towards any project are anticipated and surmountable. This show was created freely from our heart, not anticipating any pay because we believe Art can make a difference. However, for consistency, quality, and growth we ask for your donation. </p>
<p>LVnTheLife will be applying for the Community Initiatives Impact Award from the City of Austin Cultural Arts Divsion to support the show financially in order to cover pre-production, production and post-production costs such as rental of space, crew, the artist’s time in being interviewed, and editing for three shows. Our crew is small, consisting of two hosts, A cameraman, two assistants, editors, plus the interviewees in addition to the generous space given by Genuine Joe’s Coffee Shop to make this show come to life.</p>
<p>In the summer we will have a party free to the public to meet and mingle with the artists of the show. However, the award is only accepted if we meet a cash match of $750.00 minimum. Here is where you come in! And guess what?? You get a perk and get exposure through one of our social media platforms! Instagram is the big one, but we also have Youtube, Tik-Tok, Firework, Twitter, and others. It’s your choice.. And who knows, maybe you will be on the show! </p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>We aired the very first season of the show on August 18, 2019 and we want to continue until June 14, 2020 with a party end of June.</p>
<p>We are fiscally sponsored by Austin Creative Alliance which advances, connects and advocates for Austin’s arts, cultural, and creative communities in order to strengthen and protect the character, quality of life, and economic prosperity of our region.</p>
<p>Your support towards LView will raise greater awareness in the artistic and disabled communities of Austin, TX and provide a platform for locals to share their passion and love for what they do, why they do, and how they do. Don't forget to share the campaign and your support in the Arts Community.</p>

We’ll meet the proprietors of each pub and get some of the history of their establishment as well as enjoying the music of international and local Irish performers.</p>
<p>Chicago is home to many cozy Irish pubs that each feature “music sessions”, sometimes several sessions per week. There is usually a session leader, and then more musician show up to jam with the leaders. It creates a very lively, family atmosphere to experience the warmth and ambience of listening to authentic traditional Irish music in the cozy snug of an Irish Pub.We anticipate taping the show weekly and look forward to visiting many of Chicago’s Irish Pubs, for a look inside their music and history. Eventually the show will expand to include Boston, Philly, Pittsburgh, New York, Milwaukee and all the Irish American cities of the USA. We also want to take the show to include Irish pubs in Ireland, Australia, Japan, and the UK.</p>

<div>
<ul>
<li>60+ acres centrally located within Fayetteville - ~$1,900,000</li>
<li>Costs of interior design blueprints - ~$4,000-$7,000</li>

<li>Labor - awaiting blueprints</li>
<li>Insurance (specialized needed, currently 50 students or less) - ~$1,150/yr</li>
</ul>
<div>This will be our first fundraiser to jump start the project. Our immediate needs will be to purchase a warehouse building for training as we have outgrown our current space. Once we have completed Project Zen this warehouse will be used for storage. This campaign should get us about halfway there. 100% of profits go towards Project Zen. If we don't reach the entire goal, all funds will be entered into a savings account until we have enough funds for the warehouse.

<div><h3>Ultimate Goal</h3></div>
<div>Upon the completion of Project Zen in its entirety, Chuan Fa America Arkansas will provide FREE training for anyone.

<div>More than another gym or martial arts dojo, the hope of Chuan Fa America Arkansas is that Project Zen will become a landmark within the city of Fayetteville.

<div>It is our desire that these opportunities are made available to community members who could not otherwise afford a commercial martial arts school, to survivors of assault, and to those who are seeking a family oriented, yet disciplined, training atmosphere in which to learn a valuable skill and hopefully grow as individuals in the process.</div>
<div>We are also beginning to discuss launching a Project Zen - New Mexico. It will have the same goals as this campaign, but aim to partner with local universities near Albuquerque, NM. We hope eventually Chuan Fa will have many locations across the nation!</div>

</div></div>","What is Chuan Fa America?
Chuan Fa America Arkansas is a 501c3 non-profit organization that seeks to provide free martial arts training to people of all ages and all backgrounds. We believe everyone should have the ability to defend themselves. No one should be turned away because of a financial inability to afford instruction. That is why all our classes are 100% free to everyone. 
Our Goals:

Reach out to and provide a positive environment for children with little supervision (latchkey children) as well as neglected and abused children
Give students tools to defend themselves and others
Create a safe haven for young adults and survivors
Teach a variety of arts to help promote open mindedness
Work with local school systems and universities to
fight bullying
teach women’s self-defense courses
promote rape prevention awareness



These mission goals will be accomplished through the completion of Project Zen.

<h3>Zašto nas podržati?</h3>
<p>Još uvijek se nećkate? Image of War je:</p>
<ul>
<li>neovisan projekt nevezan uz ijednu političku ili ideološku opciju</li>
<li>muzej s misijom: podupirat ćemo izbjeglice i žrtve ratova danas</li>
<li>mjesto u kojem će sadašnje i buduće generacije učiti o važnosti mira</li>
<li>mjesto u kojem će se o ratu govoriti s ozbiljnošću </li>
<li>mjesto u kojem će se izlagati vrhunske ratne fotografije</li>
</ul>
<p>Kao takav, Image of War je jedinstven projekt u Zagrebu, koji još uvijek nema muzej posvećen ratnoj fotografiji, ali i u cijeloj Hrvatskoj.</p>

<h3>The idea behind Image of War</h3>
<p>Image of War’s purpose is to respond to the increasing trivialization of war and its consequences. Public discourse regarding armed conflict has become increasingly callous and indifferent. As a reaction to that, we wanted to create a place that will, through art, stimulate dialogue and educate about the devastating consequences of war and the imperative of peace for everyone. Last but not least, we wanted to create a museum with an active mission of changing realities for those directly affected by war today: <strong>a portion of all tickets sold will be donated to refugees and war victims.</strong></p>

<p>We've invested months of our time and all of our efforts and resources in the planning and realization of this museum, but what we really want is to build a place for the whole community - a place of belonging and a place of learning, a museum that is equally yours and ours. Planned opening of the museum is in July of this year and, together with the first exhibition that will cover war in Croatia from 1991-1995, we are planning to use the museum as a venue for various workshops and educational events. Exhibitions that will follow will cover the topics such as child soldiers and the Srebrenica massacre.</p>

We have already secured 90% of the funds, but we are missing the last 10% of the funds to finalize the first exhibition on war in Croatia and to open the doors of our and your museum this July. With a bit of help, we will put this museum on its feet, and each of you can become not only a museum's funder but also its founder.</p>

<h3>Why should I decide to support Image of War?</h3>
<p>Still hesitant about supporting us? Let us briefly introduce ourselves once more! Image of War is:</p>
<ul>
<li>an independent project unrelated to any political or ideological movement</li>
<li>museum with a mission: we improve lives of refugees and victims of wars today</li>
<li>a place where current and future generations will learn about the importance of peace</li>
<li>a place where war will not be trivialized but taken seriously</li>
<li>a place where state-of-the-art war photography will be exhibited</li>
</ul>
<p>And as such, Image of War is a unique project in both Zagreb and Croatia (and possibly even further!). As a country that still struggles with societal and economic consequences of the last war that happened in the 90s, we believe that this type of place is highly needed.</p>
<p>... and maybe you'll supports us just because you like our perks. That's also perfectly fine! (We love them, too!)</p>

Još uvijek se nećkate? Image of War je:

neovisan projekt nevezan uz ijednu političku ili ideološku opciju
muzej s misijom: podupirat ćemo izbjeglice i žrtve ratova danas
mjesto u kojem će sadašnje i buduće generacije učiti o važnosti mira
mjesto u kojem će se o ratu govoriti s ozbiljnošću 
mjesto u kojem će se izlagati vrhunske ratne fotografije

Kao takav, Image of War je jedinstven projekt u Zagrebu, koji još uvijek nema muzej posvećen ratnoj fotografiji, ali i u cijeloj Hrvatskoj.
...a možda vam se jednostavno sviđaju naše nagrade. I to je u redu! 
 
Tko je već prepoznao naš projekt?

***We've reached our initial goal of $8.000 - infinite thank you to all the supporters! We're moving on to our stretch goal of $10.000: all of the funds collected that surpass our initial goal will go towards establishing an audiovisual centre within Image of War museum.***

 
The idea behind Image of War
Image of War’s purpose is to respond to the increasing trivialization of war and its consequences. Public discourse regarding armed conflict has become increasingly callous and indifferent. As a reaction to that, we wanted to create a place that will, through art, stimulate dialogue and educate about the devastating consequences of war and the imperative of peace for everyone. Last but not least, we wanted to create a museum with an active mission of changing realities for those directly affected by war today: a portion of all tickets sold will be donated to refugees and war victims.

We've invested months of our time and all of our efforts and resources in the planning and realization of this museum, but what we really want is to build a place for the whole community - a place of belonging and a place of learning, a museum that is equally yours and ours. Planned opening of the museum is in July of this year and, together with the first exhibition that will cover war in Croatia from 1991-1995, we are planning to use the museum as a venue for various workshops and educational events. Exhibitions that will follow will cover the topics such as child soldiers and the Srebrenica massacre.

 
How can I help?
In order to achieve all this, we need your help! We have already secured 90% of the funds, but we are missing the last 10% of the funds to finalize the first exhibition on war in Croatia and to open the doors of our and your museum this July. With a bit of help, we will put this museum on its feet, and each of you can become not only a museum's funder but also its founder.

 
With $8000, we will be able to set up our first exhibition and open the doors of our museum in time, but we are also not planning to leave you, our dear supporter, empty-handed! Feel free to scroll though our perks and find something for yourself or your loved ones and we'll make sure to ship it to you or, even better, purchase your perks and come and visit us!

 
If we do not collect enough funds, we will invest all the funds raised in setting up the exhibition. However, we believe that, with all of you on board, we can make this happen!

 
Why should I decide to support Image of War?
Still hesitant about supporting us? Let us briefly introduce ourselves once more! Image of War is:

an independent project unrelated to any political or ideological movement
museum with a mission: we improve lives of refugees and victims of wars today
a place where current and future generations will learn about the importance of peace
a place where war will not be trivialized but taken seriously
a place where state-of-the-art war photography will be exhibited

And as such, Image of War is a unique project in both Zagreb and Croatia (and possibly even further!). As a country that still struggles with societal and economic consequences of the last war that happened in the 90s, we believe that this type of place is highly needed.
... and maybe you'll supports us just because you like our perks. That's also perfectly fine! (We love them, too!)
 
Who has already supported us through this journey?
We are grateful to our friends and partners who have already recognized and supported our vision and this project. These are:

<p>The 17th International Documentary Festival Santiago Álvarez in memoriam and the Centennial of the filmmaker will be accompanied by the city of Santiago de Cuba, for its people, its history.</p>
<p>It is a challenge to do the Festival and make the documentary about the Festival. We want to show the greatness of ""Santiago"", the city and the filmmaker who delivered a joint work that was declared a Memory of the World by UNESCO, which merged a bold and even stubborn inclination to ""chronicle"" each event, large or small, where they were involved the political soul and the struggle of the peoples of the world -together with their human dimension- to free themselves from the yokes.</p>
<p>We love documentary films, because we are convinced that it is a powerful means of union, defense and reflection of the historical, political and social context that surrounds us, to which we can not be oblivious. Documentary film is a weapon of struggle.</p>
