<p>Hello, my name is Stepan, I'm a developer with 15 years of experience. I took part in development of <a href=""https://russia2518.lenta.ch/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">games</a> and other <a href=""https://github.com/Stepka"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">projects</a>, including my own <a href=""https://store.steampowered.com/app/559360/Brocat_the_B_Game/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">experimental game</a> in the internet-culture setting, but now I want to tell you about more classic game I want to create.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the game is a <i><strong>guide on the basics of survival on the </strong></i><i><strong>terramorphic</strong></i> <i><strong>planets </strong></i>using primitive technology. </p>
<p>This is a survival game. The player finds himself on a <strong><i>terramorphic planet</i></strong>, in a frightening, unfriendly, dark, foggy, ghastly world. And most importantly, if the hero meets the night outside the shelter, he will be attacked by creepy night creatures that will kill him in the dead of night.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548864937/qbgfiy453effg0sz4glv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The player will have to craft objects for survival according to <strong><i>primitive technologies</i></strong> - from improvised means without using any tools, even a simple knife or matches, literally from shit and sticks. Everything in this world wants to kill the hero and only inner voice will help him save himself. It tells the hero to think about the ways to survive here and now, which means ensuring a shelter, fire, water, food and also tools, clothes and meds.</p>

<h3>General Information</h3>
<p><strong><i>Genre:</i></strong>  survival, crafting. </p>
<p><strong><i>Setting:</i></strong>  mysterious, ghastly worlds of terramorphic planets with dangerous inhabitants, with traces of accidents of advanced civilizations. All plants and creatures look as if they've been restored by someone who used incomplete DNA data of the Earth flora and fauna, perhaps partially from inorganic materials. And this someone didn't really understand how our life works, but the world of this planet nevertheless survived and keeps evolving.</p>
<p><i><strong>Tagline:</strong></i>  guide on the basics of survival on the terramorphic planets. </p>
<p><i><strong>View:  </strong></i>2.5D with flat figures, with a possibility of turning the camera on certain corners, camera angle - sideways behind. </p>

Life did not prepare us for this. But my game will do it.

Hello, my name is Stepan, I'm a developer with 15 years of experience. I took part in development of games and other projects, including my own experimental game in the internet-culture setting, but now I want to tell you about more classic game I want to create.
In a nutshell, the game is a guide on the basics of survival on the terramorphic planets using primitive technology. 
This is a survival game. The player finds himself on a terramorphic planet, in a frightening, unfriendly, dark, foggy, ghastly world. And most importantly, if the hero meets the night outside the shelter, he will be attacked by creepy night creatures that will kill him in the dead of night.

The player will have to craft objects for survival according to primitive technologies - from improvised means without using any tools, even a simple knife or matches, literally from shit and sticks. Everything in this world wants to kill the hero and only inner voice will help him save himself. It tells the hero to think about the ways to survive here and now, which means ensuring a shelter, fire, water, food and also tools, clothes and meds.

General Information
Genre:  survival, crafting. 
Setting:  mysterious, ghastly worlds of terramorphic planets with dangerous inhabitants, with traces of accidents of advanced civilizations. All plants and creatures look as if they've been restored by someone who used incomplete DNA data of the Earth flora and fauna, perhaps partially from inorganic materials. And this someone didn't really understand how our life works, but the world of this planet nevertheless survived and keeps evolving.
Tagline:  guide on the basics of survival on the terramorphic planets. 
View:  2.5D with flat figures, with a possibility of turning the camera on certain corners, camera angle - sideways behind. 
 
With your help we will be able to create a truly outstanding game that will not only give deep experiences, but also help you in your life​.

 

What We Need & What You Get
All funded money will be spent on art, sound design and programming. I want the game to have unique, recognizable art and fine tuned sound, and because of that I need your support.
By becoming our backer you will not only get thanks and early access to the game, you will also became our partner and a meaningful part of the community that can influence what this game will be in the future. 
 

More About The Game

Craft based on primitive technologies - the player will have to craft objects for survival according to primitive technologies - from improvised means without using any tools, literally from shit and sticks.
Hero dies if he ends up without a shelter during the night. Everything wants to kill him and only inner voice will help save the hero.
Mysterious, ghastly worlds of terramorphic planets with dangerous inhabitants. Hero wakes up on the terramorphic planet where everything looks the same as it is on the Earth, yet everything is different. All plants and creatures look as if they've been restored by someone who used incomplete DNA data of the Earth flora and fauna, perhaps partially from inorganic materials. And this someone didn't really understand how our life works, but the world of this planet nevertheless survived and keeps evolving.
Three characters with different characteristics of: level of thirst and hunger, levels of blood flow, thermal control, intoxication and mental state
Injuries and diseases are an important element of gameplay.
9 landscapes
13 monsters
18 landscape objects to interact with
45 objects for craft

Stretch Goal Progress

30 000$ - hand-drawn animated characters and creatures
40 000$ - the first scenario of salvation
50 000$ - the second scenario of salvation
60 000$ - the third scenario of salvation
70 000$ - the forth scenario of salvation

Each scenario of salvation means a pack of additional items, landscapes, the number of which is the same as in the basic game. Available scenarios are: to wait for help, to build own ship from the wreckage, to get saved by another civilization, to give new life for the planet with genetics.

Risks & Challenges
There is always a chance of unexpected problems that could occur and potentially delay the game. But I'm already 15 years in the development, so I know what to do in case something goes wrong. If we will lose someone from our team, we will find a replacement person with similar skills.

<p>Hi! I'm Masa Murda!<i> Once upon a time </i>my people were traveling through space trying to find a new planet to live on because <strong>we totally wrecked our old one</strong>. We landed on some <i>skunky world </i>right before we ran out of fuel. <strong>The place didn't even have oxygen!</strong></p>
<p>Turned out okay, though--cuz we were followed.</p>
<p>BY A BUNCH OF FREAKING CANNIBALS! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547348768/u32hshkpigj4sfk9kmj9.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>We needed a place to live and the Providers needed <strong>meat</strong>, so they fast-track terraformed and set us up real nice on the new world...y'know, <i>so they could eat us</i>.</p>
<p>Thanks to our tech-savvy cannibal buddies we have food, shelter--oxygen, and we only have to kill around one person a month to feed to them. <strong>Pretty sweet, right!</strong> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547348869/oxa3ofcrhuezzi2jgggv.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Governor Faleena Dancy has the <strong>super-fun</strong> job of handling the cannibal lotteries each month. She's got a lot of incentive to get things right, because our cannibal friends threatened to eat her if she screws up. </p>
<p>Actually, they'll eat all of us if she screws up. Did I mention they turn into <strong>berserk monsters</strong> when they get too hungry? They <strong>rampage</strong> and start <strong>eating people alive</strong>--it's hilarious!</p>
<p>Faleena's actually pretty good at her job--probably <i>too good</i>, because we colonists hate her. <strong>Her best friend is one of the cannibals! </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547348931/rc0xmie7pdolrd3flgmm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>People figure Faleena's a cannibal sympathizer and talk about revolting all the time. As if she didn't have enough problems! <i>AH HA HA HA HA HA HA!</i></p>
<p>I'm the editorializer at the colony news station, and<strong> I think this cannibalism stuff is a hoot</strong>! I'm also the one who's going to be giving you all your <strong>nifty puzzles</strong> to solve, and I'll be there after the endings whenever you <i>screw up</i>. Guess we'll be seeing a lot of each other! </p>

<p>Throughout it all, you'll face <i>truly horrific choices</i>, <strong>unthinkable situations</strong>, and <i>cringe-inducing horror</i> which is only made palatable through the antics of Cannibal Lottery's <strong>zany mascot</strong>, Masa Murda. </p>

<p><strong>Governor Faleena Dancy</strong><br/>The Providers appointed Faleena to the governor position after eating the former governor, Faleena's husband, Ludrin. To the surprise of everyone, Faleena not only accepted her husband's former post, but appears to be governing in favor of the cannibals who ate him. The reasons why are likely only known by her closest friend, the cannibal Dal-Tor. Faleena does her best to govern the colony while raising the baby born after her husband's death. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547349180/fojyslf0pimi1ihh4u9m.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Provider Emissary Dal-Tor</strong><br/>Dal-Tor is the intermediary between the cannibals and humans and spends most of her time in Faleena's office. Thousands of years old, she's found meaning in the deep relationship she has with Faleena and her daughter. Both cannibals and humans question what her true interest is in Faleena.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547349205/takznw94bem1s9pol0rc.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Vice Governor Malek</strong><br/>While the governor is appointed to her seat, the vice governor Malek was elected by the people. He always places their concerns over that of the cannibals, causing him to often butt heads with Faleena. Malek's power is limited, but he uses his influence as best he can. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547349240/b98ax96kkmvocahcx0cg.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Assistant to the Vice Governor Sharin</strong><br/>Sharin is technically Faleena's assistant also, but has shown a strong preference toward serving Malek over her. At 75 years old Sharin is deeply troubled by a policy that switches a younger lottery winner with a parent or grandparent. Faleena's support of this policy has caused strife between them. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547349280/zpxpagu2qhebmuejgher.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Lord Crieghton, Ruler of the Providers</strong><br/>Crieghton is the cannibal Faleena must answer to when she takes risks with the lotteries. His goal is to feed his 34 people as much food as possible, and he resents the small rations they endure while the colony grows. Crieghton can order the 'Sacrificial Replacement' of Faleena if she breaks any of the rules in the agreement made between the colonists and Providers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547349305/xkcsculhmeh1nldopipt.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Lottery Commissioner Gray</strong><br/>Gray has the unenviable job of facilitating the sacrifices after a lottery winner is chosen. His weight is not an issue to him, but he wishes he didn't have to deal with Dal-Tor constantly mentioning how much she wants to eat him.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547349363/wzy0ixowstil8bxd6kbt.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Media Liaison Zalby</strong><br/>Zalby's job is to coordinate between the governor's office and the colony press. It's unknown if they are loyal to Faleena or Malek, but the news that airs about Faleena is primarily negative. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547349390/c9iacii36ilinnextqw7.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Ednea</strong><br/>Now close to one year's old, Ednea is the baby girl Faleena learned she was pregnant with shortly after her husband died. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547349420/vuezpcjnxsoa4esr7ubd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>News Editorializer Masa Murda</strong><br/>Masa Murda's official job is making Faleena's life difficult by reporting on her in the worst light possible. While the other news anchors maintain an air of objectivity, Masa is happy to make edgy jokes at the governor's expense. Her unofficial job is to give players puzzles and talk to them after they get an ending. </p>

<h3>Budget</h3>
<p><i>Over $10,000 has already gone into the creation of Cannibal Lottery</i>, and this has been used entirely to pay our artists.  We learned from our last two games that a dedicated artist who will stick with you for the whole game is not cheap.  </p>
<p>The $2,000 goal of this Indiegogo will <i>not cover</i> all our expenses, but <strong>it will be enough to get this done</strong>.  We hope that we can exceed $2,000 to keep us from going too deep in the hole to create this game.</p>
<ul>
<li>Paid already - $10,000 </li>
<li>Remaining Art - $12,000</li>
<li>Programming - $4,000</li>
<li>Music Samples For Music Production - $500</li>
<li>Editing/Testing - $2,000</li>
<li>Marketing - $1,000</li>
<li>Indiegogo Fees - $200</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total - $29,700</strong></p>
<p>Paid Already -$10,000</p>
<p><strong>Total - $19,700</strong></p>
<p>Indiegogo -$2,000 </p>
<p><strong>Total - $17,700</strong></p>
<p>Kickstarter - $10,800 (Hopefully)</p>
<p><strong>Total - $6,900</strong></p>
<p>Monthly Contribution $1,000 x 7 Months = $7,000</p>
<p>The monthly contribution is what we're allocating from revenue received from our other two games.  If we fail to receive enough income from our games to pay for Cannibal Lottery the creator will finance things from credit and savings.  </p>
<p><strong>Nothing will prevent this game from being completed.</strong>  We have a proven track record.  Go to the Risks and Challenges section for more information on that.</p>

<h3>Team</h3>
<p><strong>Yamila Abraham</strong> - Heading the project is me, Yamila. I've made my living as <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Yamila-Abraham/e/B001JP1B9Y"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">an author</a> for 14 years and then switched to making games full-time in September 2017.  </p>
<p>I love writing horror (and romance).  I think cannibals are a monster with huge untapped potential.  I love the psychological implications of being eaten and stories about unavoidable sacrifice.  </p>
<p>I'm the writer, music producer, and project lead for Cannibal Lottery.  This is our third game and we're pulling out all the stops to make it a great one!  </p>
<p>Of course, I wouldn't have a hope in heck of pulling this off by myself.  I rely on my awesome team to make these games.  </p>
<p><i>ViviChibi, me, and Steve are the core team for all Y Press Games games and have been together from the beginning.</i></p>
<p><strong>ViviChibi</strong> - ViviChibi is the programmer for all Y Press Games games. She's able to pull off amazing things with the Ren'Py software.   </p>
<p><strong>Steve Warky Nunez</strong> - When and if we hit the voice acting goal, Steve will be the one to find our talent and handle all production aspects of getting lines for the game.  A prominent voice actor himself, he has amazing connections in the VA world.  </p>
<p><strong>MJ Barros</strong> - The overall look of Cannibal Lottery is dictated by the artwork of our line artist, MJ.  An artist from Chile, MJ has made producing art for Cannibal Lottery their full-time job.  We're thrilled by their dedication and talent.</p>
<p><strong>Zsardito</strong> - Zsardito is our main colorist.  They've done incredible work on defining the unique 'horror' palette of Cannibal Lottery.</p>
<p><strong>ShinigamiKitty</strong> - ShinigamiKitty is our loyal flatter. They lay down the flat colors for the colorist to work from.  This is ShinigamiKitty's second game working with us after they were drafted from the backers of the To Trust an Incubus Kickstarter.  </p>
<p><strong>Le Perrugine</strong> - The Italian art studio Le Perrugine is another line artist we've tapped to create sprites and assets.  They're ready to step in to cover main line-art duties if MJ has any problems.  We've learned you always need backups to prevent delays on shipping games!  This is Le Perrugine's second game with us (but they were a graphic novel artist for us when we were Yaoi Press).</p>
<p><strong>Elle Rei</strong> - Elle is our incredibly talented background artist.  She designed the unique look of Lushland Colony.  This is Elle's second game with us.</p>
<p><strong>Fairfaxleasee</strong> - Fairfaxleasee is another backer drafted from To Trust an Incubus, and is fast becoming a member of the core team. They are the editor, cheat map maker, tester, and achievement designer for Cannibal Lottery.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547350646/njbsrs3xefahcyvpxexl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p><strong>$10 - Your Name in the Credits &amp; Wallpaper Set.</strong> This will be a set of 5 digital desktop wallpapers in 1024x768,  1366x768, and 1920x1080 sizes.</p>
<p><strong>$25 -  Steam Code for Cannibal Lottery.</strong> You'll get your name in the credits, the wallpaper set, and the game!  </p>
<p><strong>$50 -  Art Book, Original Sound Track, and Cheat Map.  </strong>You'll get your name in the credits, the wallpaper set, a Steam key for the game, the digital art book, the original digital sound track, and the digital cheat map!  </p>
<p>The art book will not only include game art, but will describe the journey of creating the Cannibal Lottery game.  If you've read the My Magical Demon Lover or To Trust an Incubus art books you know they're incredibly insightful.</p>
<p>The Sound Track may include a voice actor blooper reel if we're able to have voice acting.  </p>
<p>The Cheat Map will include a clickable table of contents and describes how to get all the endings, achievements, and how to solve all the puzzles.</p>
<p><strong>$100 - Beta Tester. </strong> You'll get your name in the credits, the wallpaper set, a Steam key for the game, the digital art book, the original digital sound track, the digital cheat map, and you'll be an official beta tester for Cannibal Lottery!</p>
<p>Beta Testers get VIP access to the game as it's being created.  Author Yamila Abraham relies heavily on beta testers to tell her what needs to be changed in order to make the final game as strong as it can possibly be.</p>
<p>It can't be overstated how important beta testers are to the development of the game, however, most testers do not participate in helping mold the game, and simply enjoy early access to playable betas.  They enjoy chapters of the game months before the release date.</p>
<p>In past games, beta testers have had significant influence over plot, characterizations, art, and dialogue. We listen to beta testers and adapt the game based on your input.  To Trust an Incubus delivered four beta versions to testers prior to launch and granted access to a private Google Doc for input.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our ideal timeline for the project is <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JHvWc30sCPDZSOJKnt3DeUkMd0Z1pxVyIwg_-jX41Lc/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>The reason you should trust us to deliver this game on time is our track record:  </p>
<p><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/my-magical-demon-lover-bl-yaoi-gay-dating-sim/x/17676670#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">My Magical Demon Lover</a> - Promised May 2018 - Delivered May 2018</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/702614894/to-trust-an-incubus-bara-yaoi-bl-gay-dating-sim-vi/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">To Trust an Incubus</a> - Promised November 2018 - Delivered November 2018<br/>(Full Disclosure: The game was delivered on time, but physical rewards were shipped eight days late. We tried our hardest to avoid this, but made sure backers understood why there was a delay and how the problem was being solved every step of the way.)</p>
<p>We know you've probably backed a lot of projects that end up being a year or more late or are never delivered at all.  That's not how Y Press Games operates.  </p>
<p>It would take the death of the project lead or some other catastrophe to cause us to fail in our delivery.  We put a phenomenal effort in getting to rewards to backers on time, and we don't skimp on quality to meet those deadlines.  Our deadline includes time to meet all Stretch Goals.</p>
<p>You will get Cannibal Lottery on or before November 2019.  If there is an unavoidable delay it will be short.  If there is a long delay someone has died, is dying, or there is a natural or unnatural disaster of a biblical scale.  We take our delivery dates very VERY seriously.</p>

Hi! I'm Masa Murda! Once upon a time my people were traveling through space trying to find a new planet to live on because we totally wrecked our old one. We landed on some skunky world right before we ran out of fuel. The place didn't even have oxygen!
Turned out okay, though--cuz we were followed.
BY A BUNCH OF FREAKING CANNIBALS! 


We needed a place to live and the Providers needed meat, so they fast-track terraformed and set us up real nice on the new world...y'know, so they could eat us.
Thanks to our tech-savvy cannibal buddies we have food, shelter--oxygen, and we only have to kill around one person a month to feed to them. Pretty sweet, right! 

Governor Faleena Dancy has the super-fun job of handling the cannibal lotteries each month. She's got a lot of incentive to get things right, because our cannibal friends threatened to eat her if she screws up. 
Actually, they'll eat all of us if she screws up. Did I mention they turn into berserk monsters when they get too hungry? They rampage and start eating people alive--it's hilarious!
Faleena's actually pretty good at her job--probably too good, because we colonists hate her. Her best friend is one of the cannibals! 

People figure Faleena's a cannibal sympathizer and talk about revolting all the time. As if she didn't have enough problems! AH HA HA HA HA HA HA!
I'm the editorializer at the colony news station, and I think this cannibalism stuff is a hoot! I'm also the one who's going to be giving you all your nifty puzzles to solve, and I'll be there after the endings whenever you screw up. Guess we'll be seeing a lot of each other! 

Cannibal Lottery is 15 lengthy chapters of psychological horror filled with harrowing choices and bonus puzzles. Earn stats, activate flags, and manage your budget in a way that will keep both your people and the cannibals happy.
All choices matter, and will affect the likelihood of a colonist revolt, a cannibal rampage, a mental breakdown, a hostile cannibal takeover, a wildcard event, or your becoming a sacrifice yourself. 
Determine who among your staff is an ally or an enemy while also deciding whether or not to form an alliance with the cannibal leader.
Decide how much or little to trust your best friend, the cannibal Dal-Tor, and choose how to use resources to benefit the future of colony or the cannibal-human alliance.
Throughout it all, you'll face truly horrific choices, unthinkable situations, and cringe-inducing horror which is only made palatable through the antics of Cannibal Lottery's zany mascot, Masa Murda. 

Every Choice Effects a Stat or a Flag
Full of Twists that Will Make Your Jaw Drop


15 Chapters and 3 Bonus Chapters to Unlock
Puzzles, After Death Scenes, Dynamic Effects

150,000 words, Hundreds of Images 

50+ Steam Achievements, Dozens of Endings
An Original Sound Track


Governor Faleena DancyThe Providers appointed Faleena to the governor position after eating the former governor, Faleena's husband, Ludrin. To the surprise of everyone, Faleena not only accepted her husband's former post, but appears to be governing in favor of the cannibals who ate him. The reasons why are likely only known by her closest friend, the cannibal Dal-Tor. Faleena does her best to govern the colony while raising the baby born after her husband's death. 

Provider Emissary Dal-TorDal-Tor is the intermediary between the cannibals and humans and spends most of her time in Faleena's office. Thousands of years old, she's found meaning in the deep relationship she has with Faleena and her daughter. Both cannibals and humans question what her true interest is in Faleena.

Vice Governor MalekWhile the governor is appointed to her seat, the vice governor Malek was elected by the people. He always places their concerns over that of the cannibals, causing him to often butt heads with Faleena. Malek's power is limited, but he uses his influence as best he can. 

Assistant to the Vice Governor SharinSharin is technically Faleena's assistant also, but has shown a strong preference toward serving Malek over her. At 75 years old Sharin is deeply troubled by a policy that switches a younger lottery winner with a parent or grandparent. Faleena's support of this policy has caused strife between them. 

Lord Crieghton, Ruler of the ProvidersCrieghton is the cannibal Faleena must answer to when she takes risks with the lotteries. His goal is to feed his 34 people as much food as possible, and he resents the small rations they endure while the colony grows. Crieghton can order the 'Sacrificial Replacement' of Faleena if she breaks any of the rules in the agreement made between the colonists and Providers.

Lottery Commissioner GrayGray has the unenviable job of facilitating the sacrifices after a lottery winner is chosen. His weight is not an issue to him, but he wishes he didn't have to deal with Dal-Tor constantly mentioning how much she wants to eat him.  

Media Liaison ZalbyZalby's job is to coordinate between the governor's office and the colony press. It's unknown if they are loyal to Faleena or Malek, but the news that airs about Faleena is primarily negative. 

EdneaNow close to one year's old, Ednea is the baby girl Faleena learned she was pregnant with shortly after her husband died. 

News Editorializer Masa MurdaMasa Murda's official job is making Faleena's life difficult by reporting on her in the worst light possible. While the other news anchors maintain an air of objectivity, Masa is happy to make edgy jokes at the governor's expense. Her unofficial job is to give players puzzles and talk to them after they get an ending. 

Budget
Over $10,000 has already gone into the creation of Cannibal Lottery, and this has been used entirely to pay our artists.  We learned from our last two games that a dedicated artist who will stick with you for the whole game is not cheap.  
The $2,000 goal of this Indiegogo will not cover all our expenses, but it will be enough to get this done.  We hope that we can exceed $2,000 to keep us from going too deep in the hole to create this game.

Paid already - $10,000 
Remaining Art - $12,000
Programming - $4,000
Music Samples For Music Production - $500
Editing/Testing - $2,000
Marketing - $1,000
Indiegogo Fees - $200

Total - $29,700
Paid Already -$10,000
Total - $19,700
Indiegogo -$2,000 
Total - $17,700
Kickstarter - $10,800 (Hopefully)
Total - $6,900
Monthly Contribution $1,000 x 7 Months = $7,000
The monthly contribution is what we're allocating from revenue received from our other two games.  If we fail to receive enough income from our games to pay for Cannibal Lottery the creator will finance things from credit and savings.  
Nothing will prevent this game from being completed.  We have a proven track record.  Go to the Risks and Challenges section for more information on that.


Team
Yamila Abraham - Heading the project is me, Yamila. I've made my living as an author for 14 years and then switched to making games full-time in September 2017.  
I love writing horror (and romance).  I think cannibals are a monster with huge untapped potential.  I love the psychological implications of being eaten and stories about unavoidable sacrifice.  
I'm the writer, music producer, and project lead for Cannibal Lottery.  This is our third game and we're pulling out all the stops to make it a great one!  
Of course, I wouldn't have a hope in heck of pulling this off by myself.  I rely on my awesome team to make these games.  
ViviChibi, me, and Steve are the core team for all Y Press Games games and have been together from the beginning.
ViviChibi - ViviChibi is the programmer for all Y Press Games games. She's able to pull off amazing things with the Ren'Py software.   
Steve Warky Nunez - When and if we hit the voice acting goal, Steve will be the one to find our talent and handle all production aspects of getting lines for the game.  A prominent voice actor himself, he has amazing connections in the VA world.  
MJ Barros - The overall look of Cannibal Lottery is dictated by the artwork of our line artist, MJ.  An artist from Chile, MJ has made producing art for Cannibal Lottery their full-time job.  We're thrilled by their dedication and talent.
Zsardito - Zsardito is our main colorist.  They've done incredible work on defining the unique 'horror' palette of Cannibal Lottery.
ShinigamiKitty - ShinigamiKitty is our loyal flatter. They lay down the flat colors for the colorist to work from.  This is ShinigamiKitty's second game working with us after they were drafted from the backers of the To Trust an Incubus Kickstarter.  
Le Perrugine - The Italian art studio Le Perrugine is another line artist we've tapped to create sprites and assets.  They're ready to step in to cover main line-art duties if MJ has any problems.  We've learned you always need backups to prevent delays on shipping games!  This is Le Perrugine's second game with us (but they were a graphic novel artist for us when we were Yaoi Press).
Elle Rei - Elle is our incredibly talented background artist.  She designed the unique look of Lushland Colony.  This is Elle's second game with us.
Fairfaxleasee - Fairfaxleasee is another backer drafted from To Trust an Incubus, and is fast becoming a member of the core team. They are the editor, cheat map maker, tester, and achievement designer for Cannibal Lottery.

Rewards
$10 - Your Name in the Credits & Wallpaper Set. This will be a set of 5 digital desktop wallpapers in 1024x768,  1366x768, and 1920x1080 sizes.
$25 -  Steam Code for Cannibal Lottery. You'll get your name in the credits, the wallpaper set, and the game!  
$50 -  Art Book, Original Sound Track, and Cheat Map.  You'll get your name in the credits, the wallpaper set, a Steam key for the game, the digital art book, the original digital sound track, and the digital cheat map!  
The art book will not only include game art, but will describe the journey of creating the Cannibal Lottery game.  If you've read the My Magical Demon Lover or To Trust an Incubus art books you know they're incredibly insightful.
The Sound Track may include a voice actor blooper reel if we're able to have voice acting.  
The Cheat Map will include a clickable table of contents and describes how to get all the endings, achievements, and how to solve all the puzzles.
$100 - Beta Tester.  You'll get your name in the credits, the wallpaper set, a Steam key for the game, the digital art book, the original digital sound track, the digital cheat map, and you'll be an official beta tester for Cannibal Lottery!
Beta Testers get VIP access to the game as it's being created.  Author Yamila Abraham relies heavily on beta testers to tell her what needs to be changed in order to make the final game as strong as it can possibly be.
It can't be overstated how important beta testers are to the development of the game, however, most testers do not participate in helping mold the game, and simply enjoy early access to playable betas.  They enjoy chapters of the game months before the release date.
In past games, beta testers have had significant influence over plot, characterizations, art, and dialogue. We listen to beta testers and adapt the game based on your input.  To Trust an Incubus delivered four beta versions to testers prior to launch and granted access to a private Google Doc for input.


Risks & Challenges
Our ideal timeline for the project is here.
The reason you should trust us to deliver this game on time is our track record:  
My Magical Demon Lover - Promised May 2018 - Delivered May 2018
To Trust an Incubus - Promised November 2018 - Delivered November 2018(Full Disclosure: The game was delivered on time, but physical rewards were shipped eight days late. We tried our hardest to avoid this, but made sure backers understood why there was a delay and how the problem was being solved every step of the way.)
We know you've probably backed a lot of projects that end up being a year or more late or are never delivered at all.  That's not how Y Press Games operates.  
It would take the death of the project lead or some other catastrophe to cause us to fail in our delivery.  We put a phenomenal effort in getting to rewards to backers on time, and we don't skimp on quality to meet those deadlines.  Our deadline includes time to meet all Stretch Goals.
You will get Cannibal Lottery on or before November 2019.  If there is an unavoidable delay it will be short.  If there is a long delay someone has died, is dying, or there is a natural or unnatural disaster of a biblical scale.  We take our delivery dates very VERY seriously.

<p>The mobile games that has been released these days are all quite similar. All of them has different shapes with same type of rules and goals.<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>The user controls heroes while playing the game. But the purpose of the game becomes to train heroes into a higher level then to enjoy the game itself.(These days the users do not control and just watch the heroes fight automatically)</li> <li>The user will consider how to level-up heroes, but no matter how hard they try, heroes will be developed as same as others.(Therefore, no need to worry)</li> <li>Even though the user plays the game well enough, they will give up at the point where they have to use their own money to continue the game.</li> </ul> <p>We are tired of the mobile games pouring out everyday. That's why we decided to make a whole new type of game that never existed in this world. Everyday we thought about 'making a game different from the others'. We decided to cut out all useless elements and leave only the fun elements. After a long time of discussion and consideration, we decided to make the game 'Devil Decides to Die'.<br/></p>

<p></p>
<h3>Genre </h3>The game setting rule 'The enemy has to be raised as to be stronger to win the game' is different from other games. So we call this new type of game 'feeding' or 'tsundere'.<p></p>
<p>*Feeding : giving food behavior of others to grow<br/></p>
<p>*Tsundere :  (ツンデレ, [tsɯndeɽe]) is a Japanese character development process that describes a person who is initially cold and even hostile towards another person before gradually showing their warm side over time. The word is derived from the terms tsun tsun (ツンツン), meaning to turn away in disgust, and dere dere (デレデレ) meaning to become 'lovey dovey'.<br/></p>

<h3>기획의도</h3>
<p>안녕하세요. 세상을 즐겁게 만들려고 매일같이 애쓰는 whed입니다. 근래에 출시되는 모바일 게임들은 대부분 비슷한 설정으로 진행됩니다.</p>
<p>1)유저는 용사를 조종해서 단지 레벨업 하기 위해 몬스터들과 싸움을 계속합니다.(요즘은 조종도 안하고 자동으로 싸우죠.)</p>
<p>2)유저는 용사를 레벨업 시키면서 어떻게 키울지 고심하지만, 고민이 무색하게 결국 '국민테크트리'를 따라 모두 똑같은 방향으로 성장시키게 됩니다.(결국에는 고민도 안하게 되지요.) </p>
<p>3)재밌게 게임을 하다 어느 순간 현금을 쓰지 않으면 더 이상 진행을 못할만큼 어려워져서 포기하게 됩니다.(게임 회사도 먹고 살아야겠지만 좀 심하잖아요.)</p>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>우리는 이런 모바일 게임들에 완전히 질려 버렸습니다. 모두 껍데기만 다른 예쁘기만할 뿐인 게임들에 말이죠. 그래서 우리는 이 세상에 없는 장르의 게임을 만들기로 했습니다. 우리의 일상은 ""기존 방식과 다르면서 재미있는 게임을 만들고 싶다""는 고민의 연속이었습니다. 고민할 필요 없는 것들은 과감히 생략하고 재미있는 요소만을 남겨놓기로 했습니다. 그 길고 긴 인고의 시간을 보내고, 드디어 야심작  ""마왕 죽기로 결심하다""를 만들게 됐습니다.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>장르</h3>""게임에서 이기기 위해서는 적이 강해지도록 키워 주어야 한다""는 설정은 저희가 아는 바로는 기존에 찾아볼 수 없는 장르입니다. 그래서 우리는 이 새로운 게임의 장르를 ""feeding "" 혹은 ""츤데레""라고 부릅니다.<p>*Feeding : 적에게 고의로 죽어 적을 강하게 만드는게 목적적인 게임입니다.</p>
<p>*츤데레 (ツンデレ) : 재패니메이션이나 일본의 미소녀 게임에서 찾아볼 수 있는 등장인물의 인격 유형 가운데 하나를 일컫는 유행어입니다. 이 말은 ‘새침하고 퉁명스러운 모습’을 나타내는 일본어 의태어인 츤츤(つんつん )과 ‘부끄러워하는 것’을 나타내는 일본어 의태어 데레데레(でれでれ)의 합성어입니다. 즉, '츤데레 게임'은 퉁명스럽게 적과 싸우는 듯 보이지만, 사실은 적이 더 강해지도록 노력해야 하는 게임입니다.</p>

<div>*몬스터<p></p>
<p>기괴하지만 미워할 수 없는 몬스터들입니다. 영문도 모른채 용사들과 싸워야 하고 마왕의 계획 때문인 것도 모른채 열심히 노력해도 늘 용사에게 패배하는 모습이 안 쓰럽기도 합니다.</p>

<p>용사들과 몬스터가 전반적으로 귀엽다면 타이틀은 진지하고 싶었습니다. 어이없는 설정과 귀여운 캐릭터와 다르게 우리가 매우 진지하게 이 게임을 만들고 있다는 것을 보여줍니다.</p>

Game Story One day, the Devil decides to kill himself.
Unfortunately he cannot kill himself, as well as none to kill him in hell. 
So the Devil decides to train human heroes to kill him.
And executes his secret plan…
What is the Devil's intention? And can he fulfill his wish?




<The heroes are cute and bright unlike their names.>

Development StoryHi! We are ""whed"", the company working to make this world funnier and happier everyday.
The mobile games that has been released these days are all quite similar. All of them has different shapes with same type of rules and goals.

The user controls heroes while playing the game. But the purpose of the game becomes to train heroes into a higher level then to enjoy the game itself.(These days the users do not control and just watch the heroes fight automatically) The user will consider how to level-up heroes, but no matter how hard they try, heroes will be developed as same as others.(Therefore, no need to worry) Even though the user plays the game well enough, they will give up at the point where they have to use their own money to continue the game.  We are tired of the mobile games pouring out everyday. That's why we decided to make a whole new type of game that never existed in this world. Everyday we thought about 'making a game different from the others'. We decided to cut out all useless elements and leave only the fun elements. After a long time of discussion and consideration, we decided to make the game 'Devil Decides to Die'.





Genre The game setting rule 'The enemy has to be raised as to be stronger to win the game' is different from other games. So we call this new type of game 'feeding' or 'tsundere'.
*Feeding : giving food behavior of others to grow

<Monsters looks strange but cute at the same time. They have to fight with the heroes without knowing why they are fighting, what the Devil's intention is and most of all fail during fighting with the heroes.>


PlatformWe will release iOS & Android at the moment.


Game Rules



The user becomes the Devil and participate monsters in the game. The heroes cannot be controlled. Even though the main character of the game is the heroes. The heroes fight with monsters automatically, and also grow while fighting.




The user does not have to care about the heroes' ability. When monsters drop items and skills, the heroes get them.


The heroes use the items and skills to fight monsters, also automatically.


The user has to send out various types of monsters in order not to kill the weak the heroes. You will lose the game if the heroes all die. The user shall feed the heroes with monsters properly so that the heroes level up and survive.

Pray for the heroes to become stronger and stronger to kill the Devil.

기괴하지만 미워할 수 없는 몬스터들입니다. 영문도 모른채 용사들과 싸워야 하고 마왕의 계획 때문인 것도 모른채 열심히 노력해도 늘 용사에게 패배하는 모습이 안 쓰럽기도 합니다.
*타이틀
용사들과 몬스터가 전반적으로 귀엽다면 타이틀은 진지하고 싶었습니다. 어이없는 설정과 귀여운 캐릭터와 다르게 우리가 매우 진지하게 이 게임을 만들고 있다는 것을 보여줍니다.

유저는 마왕의 입장이 되어 몬스터를 출전 시킵니다. 용사는 조정할 수 없습니다. 주인공은 용사인데도 말이죠. 용사는 자동으로 몬스터와 싸우고, 이기면 자동으로 성장합니다. 유저는 용사의 파라메터에 신경 쓸게 전혀 없어요. 허약한 용사가 죽지 않고 무럭무럭 강해질 수 있도록 적절한 조합으로 몬스터를 출전시켜야 합니다. 용사가 몬스터와 싸워서 모두 죽으면 실패합니다. 어찌됐든 용사들이 죽지 않도록 몬스터들을 먹여 줘야 합니다. 무럭 무럭 강해진 용사가 무사히 마왕을 무찌를 수 있도록 기도하세요.


배급전략

우리는 강력한 퍼블리셔와 손을 잡지도 않을 것이고, 반복적인 게임 내 광고 노출로 유저를 현혹하지도 않으려고 합니다. 퍼블리셔가 제공하는 막강한 지원은 달콤하지만, 퍼블리셔에게만 유리한 계약 조건들은 스타트업이 감내하기에는 너무나 큰 위험이 되기도 합니다. 우리는 스스로의 힘으로 최대한 많은 언어로 최대한 많은 나라에 출시할 계획입니다. 우리가 출시한 여러 나라중에 어느 한 곳에서라도 '마왕 죽기로 결심하다'가 가능성을 보인다면 그때에 퍼블리셔와 계약해도 늦지 않을 것이라 생각합니다. 펀딩 목표액은 20만 달러 입니다. 한국어와 영어로 2016년 1Q에 출시할 예정입니다. 추가 1만 달러마다 일어, 중국어, 독어, 스페인어, 프랑스어, 아랍어, 러시아어, 포르투칼어, 이탈리아어, 터키어다음 순서대로 언어를 하나씩 추가할 예정입니다.

Bloodbath is a new type of Starcraft 2 micro game (Free To Play).


Cards provides users with units to engage in warfare.



The combat system rewards a tactical approach to micro and multitasking.

<p>Hey everyone. I Am Lucid. I am 16 years old starting out what I want to be my career. I am from Florida in the United States. I started YouTube because I really enjoy gaming and I also really enjoy lifting people up and making their day better. So I started YouTube wanting to do those things as a job.<br/>     God gave me a talent so  I started a youtube channel to put out content just because the first video I ever made was pretty fun to do. So then I just kept on doing it. I have a passion for this sort of thing.<br/>        I didn't want to get stuck with a boring 9-5 job. So I decided I would try my luck at YouTube. It got discouraging at times but then there were people that told me not to let anything discourage me.. As I started watching my analytics I saw that if I were to lose one subscriber I would always gain like three. So it didn't discourage me anymore.<br/>        I love making videos. It is so much fun. So I'm going to keep on producing content. I hope to make my passion my job. If you would like to support me in this journey I would be very appreciative. If I reach my goal I will be able to efficiently start YouTube and be able to actually make a difference. There are so many things I need, but all of them cost so much. </p>
<p>       I put my goal as 5000 dollars, which wouldn't actually get me everything I need, but it would get me a lot of the things needed in YouTubing. I need a good computer that can not only record and stream, but also play games, I need an xbox console seeing as how I record Xbox one gameplay too, I need cameras, microphones, monitors, a desk, headphones, editing software, recording software, photoshop software, games, lightening equipment, green screen, gaming peripherals, sound dampening items, and some more.

<p><strong> Battle Tank Arena</strong> is a highly strategic, 2 acre indoor arena that puts 20 tanks and drivers in fierce combat against each other for a 20 minute battle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>       The game gets more intense with every 3 hits you take because your speed and firing capability drops one percent, while that doesn't seem like much at first, you soon realize that you need everything you have to survive the twenty minute battle. Are you the prey or the predator?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This game was created by John Kennedy. Battle Tank Arena is the collection of 4 years of research and design and it brings together movies, video games, simulators and actual tanks that are designed for a real intense arena gaming experience that has never before been created like this and because of this we started this Indiegogo campaign because we <strong>can't</strong> build this without you.</p>
<p>So if you're into military tank battles, video games, amusement rides or alien death rays, please help us bring this game to life.  We think you'll love it as much as we do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>HOW IT WORKS</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">You climb into a tank, drive onto the arena</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">and shoot to disable other tanks without getting disabled yourself!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578882372/xrzfpbvhmy0f0cmubbl1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Production of the arena is simple once our prototype is completed. The biggest challenge for us is getting the prototype to operate 12 hours on a single charge with a 250lb occupant, but our R&amp;D company are confident they will get that mastered so we don't have to waste time changing out batteries. Our research and development company tells us that either way we can have our working prototype within 50 days so then its on to full production of our arena tanks!</p>
<p>Our main challenge left on the prototype though is financial, that is why we came to Indiegogo, because here is where the community helps the creative seed grow into the reality tree.</p>
<p>We have already been in contact with our suppliers for our perks to make sure that no matter how many people pledge, everyone gets their perks quickly after the campaign ends,  we don't want this to be a campaign where you spend the next six months to two years getting fifty emails about production updates and delays. If you back this project, we want you to feel assured that your tank perk package will come within 30 days of campaign completion (exception is shipping of the mockup perk, see perk shipping details for mockup). This is why we're not offering multibeam laser weapons or crazy complicated reward tiers that would make the distribution process take unreasonably long.  We're keeping it as simple as possible: support our project and in return we'll send you the tank perks of your choosing as fast as possible, you deserve at least that much for supporting us!</p>

</ul>
</div><p> </p></div>","Battle Tank Arena is a highly strategic, 2 acre indoor arena that puts 20 tanks and drivers in fierce combat against each other for a 20 minute battle.
 
       The game gets more intense with every 3 hits you take because your speed and firing capability drops one percent, while that doesn't seem like much at first, you soon realize that you need everything you have to survive the twenty minute battle. Are you the prey or the predator?
 
This game was created by John Kennedy. Battle Tank Arena is the collection of 4 years of research and design and it brings together movies, video games, simulators and actual tanks that are designed for a real intense arena gaming experience that has never before been created like this and because of this we started this Indiegogo campaign because we can't build this without you.
So if you're into military tank battles, video games, amusement rides or alien death rays, please help us bring this game to life.  We think you'll love it as much as we do.
 
HOW IT WORKS
You climb into a tank, drive onto the arena
and shoot to disable other tanks without getting disabled yourself!

 
With a top speed around 5-7 mph and 400-500 rounds of RFID ammo, you target enemy tank sensors while protecting your own.

Tank to tank communications and a full field of view of what's in front of you displayed on a 30"" display screen.

Fully enclosed inside your battle tank while you drive and shoot.

500 rounds of RFID encoded ammo so you know when you actually score a hit!

Lots of target sensors so you better keep moving!

 
 





Don't watch a tank battle movie. Drive, shoot and decide the outcome!

 

We wanted to put this project on Indiegogo because it's the fastest way for us to get Battle Tank Arena off the drawing board and into your hands.  We think the arena will be great, but we need your help making it a reality.

So, if a world full of weaponized arena battle tanks with RFID ammo is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. 
 
What we need to build our working prototype is $100,000. This will allow our Research and Development company to design and build our electric battle tank from completed CAD designs to a working driving and shooting battle tank complete with sensor and targeting software that will integrate with all the tanks in the arena for the scoring and damage . This will allow us to begin production of 40 battle tanks for the arena.
 


Our research and development company's manufacturing facility in China, is a high-tech state of the art production facility that will produce our arena tanks from RFID sensors to  tread system to a completed arena battle tank that will roll off the line with 43 others to give us our complete complement of tanks at our facility in South Carolina.
 
 

What You Get:

GREAT REWARDS, be sure to click on the perks to see what incredible deals come with each perk!

You get arena game cards on special collectable crowdfunder cards.
The top two perks also offer a signed thankyou from the creator for backing the project.
Beta test our arena tanks for up to 45 days before we open to the public. (notifications when all productions tanks are ready to test will be sent out to all crowdfunders)
Higher level rewards will be on special limited metal game cards that will offer even crazier perks.

We will also be offering a special perk, the full size mock-up as our top reward for creating the prototype. 
Once the final blueprints from the prototype are generated, we will no longer need the prototype and will give it away at our grand opening in a drawing from all our crowdfunders for a lucky crowdfunder to take home where they can drive and shoot in their own backyard!
 


The Impact

No more Ferris wheels, roller coasters or bumper cars as the top form of amusement.
The next generation of interactive gaming you have been waiting for.
With our patents already pending for the Battle tanks and arena center, we will be the ONLY amusement center in the world that has an actual tank arena where you along with  19 other people show off your skill and tactics as tank commanders by disabling the enemies tanks!
Only YOU will bring the battle tank and the arena to life as an amusement center.
Now we can bring you a new form of fun and excitement for the whole family that isn't a video game or another been there, done that theme park. Help us bring you the action and adventure that you deserve and have only dreamed about.
We will start our first arena in the U.S, our second facility will be in London.

The biggest challenge for us is getting the prototype to operate 12 hours on a single charge with a 250lb occupant, but our R&D company are confident they will get that mastered so we don't have to waste time changing out batteries.

<p>Download the demo here: <a href=""https://lockecole88.itch.io/dojo-master"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://lockecole88.itch.io/dojo-master</a></p>
<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Ever since I was young, I wanted to create games for a living. Starting out with pen &amp; paper adventures in Dungeons &amp; Dragons and moving on to the StarCraft map editor got my feet wet in programming, and now years later, I am a professional Web Developer! I may have missed the mark a bit on the type of Developer I became, but I still am passionate about games, and like to work on creating my own in my spare time. My biggest problem is that I don't have a lot of spare time, and I still have lots of bills to pay! Despite that, last November, I spent a month making game for a Game Jam, and I loved it! (game programming is much more fun than web programming) Dojo Master is the product of that jam, and the demo here is a polished up version of what I submitted.</p>
<p>My goal of this campaign isn't just to raise funds, but to try and raise awareness and see how interested people are in my game. I received a lot of positive feedback from people (and not just friends and family, but random Internet strangers! The most important people in the world!) and would really like to continue working on this project to really flesh it out. Unfortunately, I am going at a snails pace now because I don't have any funding, and I am too afraid to risk going all out on it as if it doesn't pan out, then I'll be out of a home!</p>
<p>Anybody who contributes to this project will not only be helping in turning this demo into a full game, but will be part of a community! I want people to really be a part of this game, and have a part of it for them!  You don't even have to contribute money to the project either, I'm all about giving perks to people who help just by spreading the word as well (more on that below). So I hope you'll play the demo, like what you play, and want to contribute in whatever way you can. I think you'll like what you get for contributing as well!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I set a flexible goal of $12,000 for this campaign. This is to cover expenses for a 4-month period to get the game into a full beta state: main game complete, but playtesting will be needed for combat balance and bug-finding. And by expenses, I mean allowing me to work full-time on this project and commissioning for things like art and music. Should the entire goal not be met, that will just slow things down. My estimated 4 months beta completion could become anywhere from 6 - 12 months based on how much is raised. BUT, if a lot of positive feedback and hype is raised, that might be enough incentive for me to bite the bullet, max out my credit cards, and hope for the best (i.e that I won't lose my home and be put in crippling debt... more crippling debt... I still got 2 years of student loans to pay off).</p>
<p>Okay, but now for the fun part: THE PERKS! If you do decide to help fund the project, you will be a part of the game in some way! That's right, a piece of you will be coded into the game - perhaps you will make a smarmy student, a legendary weapon, a badass enemy, or a rando NPC who can't find the bathroom! The possibilities are limitless! <small>(note: possibilities are not limitless, and are based on how much funding and/or how much hype you generate)</small></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>Your help in this project will bring to life a new Dojo Management RPG, and isn't that actually a kind of unique game? (Please let me know if there are any games like this out there. I would like to play them) And if the game does well, you just helped usher in a new indie game studio! Good job! You'll be making dreams come true, and gamers like yourself very happy!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest obstacle is time - I have gotten pretty good at estimating project lengths during the 8+ years I've been a Web Developer, but depending on the amount of money raised and unforseen life circumstances occurring, this project could take a bit of time to turn from demo into full game. I am confident that if funding meets its goal, that I will reach a full beta in 4 months time. I will be making frequent updates here and in my dev log on itch.io to keep you all up-to-date on what's happening.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>So, if you like this project, funding is great, but getting the word out there is just as important! And I don't want anyone who can't fund to be left out of the community building aspect of this, so perks are available to those who promote the game across social media as well! Make some noise on the facebooks, twitters, instagrams, and myspaces (whatever the kids are using these days) - tell your friends and family in the ""real world"" - tell your favorite ""influencer"" and have <i>them<i> </i></i>spread the word!</p>

Much like the backer perks, the more money your referrals bring in, the better perk YOU will get! Each referral dollar you bring in counts a 50 cents towards a perk you will get, up to the ""Create a NPC"" tier.</li>
<li>If you don't care about getting that granular and tracking all those referral results, just take a screenshot (and you can blur out any names or personal details in the screenshot) of your tweet or facebook post (or whatever), and send it to dojo_master@catcastlegames.com and you will get to ""Name a Student""</li>
</ul>
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>I have created a subreddit <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/dojo_master/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">/r/dojo_master/</a> where people can post stories, screenshots, critiques, ideas, or just to talk about Dojo Master! I'd especially love to hear If you have ideas for things you'd like to see in the game, bugs &amp; glitches you encounter, and your critiques both good and bad! People who are active in the community and contribute in a meaningful way will receive additional perks - not sure exactly what they will be, and unlike referrals which can be tracked, it will be based on my subjective view of things - but if you're actively contributing in some way, I'll get you something!</p>
<h2>Future of the Game</h2>
<p>The demo is just a glimpse of things to come, in the full game expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least 5 more dojos to fight as part of the main story (and maybe some SECRET dojos???)</li>
<li>A story full of intrigue, drama, and comedy!</li>
<li>Better and more procedurally generated quests &amp; content</li>
<li>more weapons, armors, items, many more abilities, and generally more things to do</li>
<li>ability to send your students on quests and ""Training Excursions"" so that they can learn new skills and level up in different ways (if they don't die)</li>
<li>Mini-games for cooking and blacksmithing</li>
<li>Who knows? Other features based on community feedback!</li>

<p><strong>Keep Zom Coming</strong> is an arcade first person shooter based on the beautiful places of Guatemala, Mayan culture and its remote locations.</p>
<p>You need to endure as much as you can from the waves of zombies coming from every direction. The thing is, you can only see 1 of 4 possible directions zombies can attack you. You are going to be able to temporarily block an alley using grenades and other various weapons and abilities to survive.</p>
<p>Each map has its own boss battle based on Guatemalan culture, like ¨El Torito¨ which is a guy wearing a piñata in the shape of a bull with fireworks attached to it (<a href=""https://youtu.be/4AwYC_zJ8UY?t=11"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://youtu.be/4AwYC_zJ8UY?t=11</a>).</p>

<p>Guatemala is full of secrets that can transport you to different eras. From Mayan culture to colonial architecture and all of nature wonders merging into one location.</p>
<p>These are the four locations that will be in the game. You can have a little glimpse of them through the links below.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=S_XJV_-G66Y"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Antigua Guatemala, Guatemala</a>: Used to be the capital of Guatemala but in 1776 the volcano “Fuego” erupts and the people had to evacuated to safety. Now, it's a popular place for people all over the world to experience the colonial arquitectures, the food and friendly people who lives there. The buildings from that era had been preserved and you can see the damages of some buildings still suffer from the volcano.</p>

<div>
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=4J9GIVfKTWQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tikal, Peten</a>: Was the center of the mayan culture at the time and probably the largest cities we can find in mesoamerica. The main attraction its the “Gran Jaguar” the main pyramid you can find at the center of the forest of peten. The episode IV of Star Wars record a scene from the movie in this amazing place.</div>

<p><a href=""https://youtu.be/HO-ElrWu_Rc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lake Atitlan, San Marcos</a>: Surrounded by 3 volcanos, the vistas of the lake are something you cannot miss if you come to Guatemala on your vacations.

<p>The soundtrack is all about having an epic sound combined with Guatemalan folklore. A mix of instruments from the country, like the marimba, tzicolaj, huehuetl and tunkul, are merged with other sounds and instruments to create different rich melodies. Each level will have a specific sound related to the location, whether it be church bells from the cathedrals of Antigua Guatemala, or rainforest ambience from the jungles of Tikal.</p>

</div></div>","Keep Zom Coming is an arcade first person shooter based on the beautiful places of Guatemala, Mayan culture and its remote locations.
You need to endure as much as you can from the waves of zombies coming from every direction. The thing is, you can only see 1 of 4 possible directions zombies can attack you. You are going to be able to temporarily block an alley using grenades and other various weapons and abilities to survive.
Each map has its own boss battle based on Guatemalan culture, like ¨El Torito¨ which is a guy wearing a piñata in the shape of a bull with fireworks attached to it (https://youtu.be/4AwYC_zJ8UY?t=11).
 The map included in the demo hasn´t been optimized since the beginning of development. The demo is a glimpse of what the full version will be. This is a fixed-funding campaign. Keep Zom Coming can only happen if our goal is reached.
Trailer
Dont miss out on the trailer.

 
Gameplay
You can check out the concept of the gameplay on this video. Look around and try to keep the zombies away from you. You will need to clear each corridor of zombies before you can move through it, and on to the next.

 
Thriller Chapin
We were so excited to release the campaign, that the only logical thing to do was dance until our bodies hurt! This is the visual representation.

 

 
After the campaign is over there's a lot to be done and here's a list of the things we are going to do and what are you helping us achieve. We hope this gives you a glimpse into the process and our goal.

4 unlockable and unique maps of Guatemalan locations including: Antigua, Tikal, Lake Atitlan and Semuc Champey
4 bosses, one for each map
6 types of weapons
6 types of zombies (plus the ones offered in some rewards)
3 types of grenades
Add vertical mobility
Weapons visibility
Enemy proximity alerts
UI and design
Score and Leaderboards
Drop items (coins, health, powerups)
Unlockables
Achievements
Music for maps, menus and sound FX
Constant improvement of game mechanics
Custom animations
Offer the game in 5 languages (English, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, German)

 

 
We are a 2-man team that will expand once the campaign succeeds.

The zombies have evolved from their initial designs. The zombies first wore a typical office outfit, but was later changed to a more traditional Guatemalan outfit.
Certain zombies have different abilities depending on the outfit they wear. These outfits will also change to adapt to the Guatemalan theme of the game. There will be specific zombies for each location.
 

Right now, there's 2 main zombies models, one tougher than the other. The first one wears tradional clothes from Guatemala. These clothes designs will vary depending on what region the zombie is in.

The second one has no clothing. You can see the infection growing and taking over the body. There will be variations and mutations dependent on the level of difficulty. 

 

Guatemala is full of secrets that can transport you to different eras. From Mayan culture to colonial architecture and all of nature wonders merging into one location.
These are the four locations that will be in the game. You can have a little glimpse of them through the links below.
Antigua Guatemala, Guatemala: Used to be the capital of Guatemala but in 1776 the volcano “Fuego” erupts and the people had to evacuated to safety. Now, it's a popular place for people all over the world to experience the colonial arquitectures, the food and friendly people who lives there. The buildings from that era had been preserved and you can see the damages of some buildings still suffer from the volcano.


 


Tikal, Peten: Was the center of the mayan culture at the time and probably the largest cities we can find in mesoamerica. The main attraction its the “Gran Jaguar” the main pyramid you can find at the center of the forest of peten. The episode IV of Star Wars record a scene from the movie in this amazing place.



 
Semuc Champey, Alta Verapaz: (where the river hides below the stones) The flora and fauna you can find in this place it's fascinating. There's caves you can explore and the river that changes to different colors in each season of the year transform this magical place into one of the most exciting places to become an authentic “Indiana Jones”.


 
Lake Atitlan, San Marcos: Surrounded by 3 volcanos, the vistas of the lake are something you cannot miss if you come to Guatemala on your vacations. There is a lot of little villages you can visit taking a boat across the sky blue lake and maybe a little surprise if you are crossing you are going to fight off to continue in your journey.



 




The soundtrack is all about having an epic sound combined with Guatemalan folklore. A mix of instruments from the country, like the marimba, tzicolaj, huehuetl and tunkul, are merged with other sounds and instruments to create different rich melodies. Each level will have a specific sound related to the location, whether it be church bells from the cathedrals of Antigua Guatemala, or rainforest ambience from the jungles of Tikal.

Heres the chart of the perks you can get if you decide to back up this project, hope you like whats in store for you. 



There's still a lot of thing we would love to do but there's a big effort and considerations to this points that we thought it would be better to put them as Stretch Goals.

<p>My name is David Watson and I am the sole proprietor of Maddman Studios. A virgin studio that intends on breaking into the gaming industry with energy and imagination, with your help.</p>
<p>All funding that is raised will go to the establishment of Maddman Studios and the making of our first Game, The Island.</p>
<p>Establishing our studios name involves hiring game designers, hiring employees, paying salaries, advertising, buying computers, and leasing a building. To accomplish this, Maddman Studios will need $60,000  to establish its name and to launch our first Game within a year and a half.</p>
<p>Currently all work has been done by myself, I hope to hire others during this time for help and to add to available jobs during this pandemic.</p>
<p>With that being said, I would like to introduce the flagship of Maddman Studios, The Island.</p>
<p>The Island is a first person game of mystery and exploration. There are no guns, there is no death, and no map, just time. You have all the time that you need to learn all the secrets that the Island has. But fear not, all questions will be answered in time, all you have to do is follow the clues and discover the mystery of The Island. The area viewed in the video is 1/4 of the size of the map that is planned. The world will be tremendously bigger, along with at least 25 to 30 structures and 100 collectables, everything you need to have an amazing adventure. Learn the hidden secrets that the Island keeps and you will ultimately discover yourself.</p>
<p>Along with helping a game studio get on its feet, we have established great perks for your donations. The first level has unlimited spots and it is the $5 tier. If you donate $5 you will be named in the credits of the game as well as you being named as a baker on our up coming Facebook page.</p>
<p>The highest level has five spots and it is the $1000 level, on this level you will receive a free early copy of the game, a character in the game named after you, a map of the entire island and a key that opens a special mystery in the game. This level also includes a sneak peak of Maddman Studios second Game Demons.</p>
<p>Thank you and I will see you on The Island.</p>

Thus, we’ve started with making Airport Master world a pretty realistic place where there are lift and drag and air masses movement, where aircraft actually have IAS, TAS and GS.

This car was nearly 46 years old and I have to say it was a little scary squeezed into the drivers seat and to imagine what it might have been like to drive this awesome race car...Meeting my hero....Meeting your heroes can sometimes be disappointing, but this was not the case for me and the 917 just spurred me on to recreate something close to the original experience of driving this amazing car and something special for like minded fans...So what do the people who have driven the 917 have to say...It was a lovely car to drive; it turned in very well…. When you put the power on the back was quite enthusiastic to come round… by comparison, the Ferrari 512 that I drove at Le Mans the previous year did not send you any messages… Derek BellI remember walking around this thing and literally stroking it...

This could be a party where you get all your driving pals around to test your driving skills in a competitive and fun activity or it could be as part of a corporate event or exhibition.This offering is based upon a 'one day' event but we can offer longer terms should you want to extend the experience and is based on a first come first severed to avoid double booking. We hope that you can see something from our rewards that you like and look forward to thanking you for your support.YOUR HELPYour contribution will help us build the simulator and to arrange for the simulator has its first event appearances. WHY IS THIS IMPORTANTSo this is not just about us this project is about fans and providing a unique experience, something extremely rare, but to generate an unforgettable experience.  Its about having fun, doing something very special and unique, a little bit of time travel... back to the 1970's...Risks & ChallengesWe have carried out all the calculations and with the help of Radical Simulator and RallyPrep, Chris Beatty Design and Faroux Sports Cars imparting their skills and experience we have a very strong plan to get the simulator complete and not only functioning but looking and functioning as we envisage so that the experience is unforgettable.That said, delays can obviously occur, especially with supplied parts, however, we have already sourced these ready for the start of the build and expect few hiccups along the way but if there are  issues we will need to work through these, but we will have the team on hand whose experience and skill should find solutions. Neil at Rally Prep has has been involved in building over 40 road and track cars and so knows how to build one off and complex cars and vehicles, and is the sort of chap that just gets things done.With Gavin's at Radical Simulation expertise in simulator and VR, we can build a simulator that will generate the best experience possible and will have the ability to be upgraded as the software improves. Marcel and Chris at Faroux build 917 kits and have years of engineering experience as does Chris Beatty who is a specialist 3D designer and animator will help us ensure that the design and final product will be awesome.What happens after the Simulator is Built?Once the simulator is built we will do shake down tests and include consultative assistance to set the simulator to produce the most accurate of experiences and as real to the original as is possible. It will then be delivered to events and exhibitions throughout the UK so that fans who have purchased drive vouchers will get the opportunity to get behind the wheel.The business model will continue to promote and exhibit the simulator at events and will work with clients to offer the rig for corporate events.Our affiliate partner is boutique-cars.com which will be selling project related products to also generate a revenue for the initiative.Other Ways You Can HelpSo, if you like the project your help will be appreciated if you purchase rewards or just share the project through your network so that we can reach as many like minded fans as possible.To be part of this doesn’t mean that you have to experience or even become a member of the 917DriveClub, but if you think the idea is cool, help us to pass the word around and join our networks:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A farther, a husband, an office worker, a gamer... For a long time I'v been chasing a carrier in the field i don't really like, just because it was paying well. Support engineer is a good job, but not something i'd like to be doing my whole life.</p>
<p>Though creating games and spending time thinking of what i could make, what i would like to make seems much more appealing.</p>
<p>I'm looking for funding to be able to quit my day job and create a first game as it requires some time to create and polish game. I already have base, but need time to polish the game and add many more features to it.</p>
<p>Your help will not only allow me to follow my dream that i always had, but will also allow me to make my own company, to gather other people feeling like me and having the passion to create fun for themselves and for others.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most of the budget would go as the salary for the game makers and designers to create assets</li>
<li>As a gamer I'm not looking into pay-to-win scheme, it spoils the game. the only thing that will be possible to buy in the game will be cosmetics.</li>
<li>This game will be released, no matter what. Why? because that is my dream, with no help it will take longer, but there is nothing impossible if you put enough effort to it</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Imagine the game, cross platform, for which you can spend from few minutes a day to few hours. Just as much as you wish, o are able to spend today. You can play it casually, just going and killing mobs in the dungeon floor, collecting items and upgrading your gear. Or you can go for that big boss and better loot together with your friend, as it seems more fun for you. You can replay this game many times, because map layout is always different, as it is procedural generated. Short fight against mobs, or maybe a fight against your friend? it not that you always want to play against game, some times there is wish to show for that friend of yours, that you dodging and attacking skills are better and his luckily collected shining sword wont win against your  baguette sword or spiked mace you found and upgraded earlier.</p>
<p>I know that i want a game like that, that i could play on mobile phone, or my pc, or maybe my console.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have never created a game previously. But i have played a lot of them and have a vision of what i want.</p>
<p>Creating a game with Unreal Engine might be quite challenging, as there are some many ways to do things, but there is such a good community, ready to assist you when there are questions that you cant find answers to by yourself.</p>
<p>Using free assets or purchasing? Or maybe drawing it your self?</p>
<p>it all depends on how much money you have to spend, as original content is always preferred, though not always available.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You cant contribute by money, but still want to help me to create this game?</p>
<p>Maybe you are a good animator? Maybe you can create various graphical assets to make a game more appealing and more visually beautiful? Or maybe you can create a music for the game, that even after finishing the level you would keep it open on your screen, so that just to listen more to that background track?</p>

<p>Edge of Twilight is a 3rd person action adventure game developed for the PC and Xbox 360 platforms. It is a story set in a post-apocalyptic world that has been split into two parallel realms: Day and Night. Players take on the role of Lex, an outcast bounty hunter who has found himself in the middle a clash resulting from an impetuous greed for a solitary source of energy. Lex finds himself caught between two polar opposite civilizations, the Atherns and the Lithern.</p>
<p>Lex is the only living halfbreed left in the world, giving him the unique ability to venture between the two parallel realms.In his mission to close the Rift that divides the realms and bring stability to the world, Lex realizes that his halfbreed nature is the last chance this world has to escape complete darkness. During his journey, Lex will become part of an increasingly complex storyline that blurs the line between good and evil, right and wrong. This is a story full of wildly interesting characters, over-the-top action-packed scenes, and ornate mysteries set within an alternate universe where anything is possible. </p>

Hellayem is a vast and largely uncharted land that contains all manner and varieties of fauna and flora, and with it, an immensely powerful source of energy that flows naturally throughout.Referred to as Ether,this largely unexplained energy source affects every living creature of the world in various undefined ways.

A New World



(Above: A cave in Selann mountains in the Day Realm and Night Realm, respectively. The Night Realm is filled with vaporized Ether, changing the environment.)
Edge of Twilight’s (EoT) story begins in the land of Hellayem, hundreds of years prior to the game’s main events. Hellayem is a vast and largely uncharted land that contains all manner and varieties of fauna and flora, and with it, an immensely powerful source of energy that flows naturally throughout.Referred to as Ether,this largely unexplained energy source affects every living creature of the world in various undefined ways. It is known to flow and exist within environments everywhere and at all times.However its actual form is dictated by Day and by Night. 

Bounty Hunter Lex

Lex grew up an orphan on the streets of the iron city, the Citadel of Athyr, and is contracted as a contract killer, thug, and bounty hunter by the Martial Corps. 
Empress Galina

Empress Galina is a beautiful young woman in whom the Athern population has placed its faith. By many, she is considered a lonely and unlucky child, born in a very turbulent time and burdened with huge responsibilities and no alternatives. 
Lukasin
Lukasin is the demented and bloodthirsty leader of the Tainted Lithern. Lukasin is hell-bent on exterminating the Athern race and bringing his own disturbed rule over the land. Lukasin was once a young, peaceful, and ambitious Lithern who aspired to tread in the footsteps of his elders, who lived a life of divine spirituality. After the arrival of the Athern race to Hellayem and the subsequent violent treatment of his own race, Lukasin was swiftly thrust into the position of a leader due to his being one of the few surviving Majestic to escape the Athern onslaught.


The Tainted are the main enemies of Edge of Twilight. They remain true to its faith of worshiping nature but exist in a corrupted state. With his new-found powers, Lukasin is able to call forward damned Lithern spirits from the Twilight Realm and re-animate them into the Day or the Night realm. A Tainted is an enslaved and demonized representation of a deceased Majestic Lithern. They are not exactly alive, nor are they dead. The Tainted carry a simple but distinctive look. They are Lithern, after all, and thus behave as basic grunt units: expendable.They are deployed with the sole purpose of destroying anyone who threatens the Ether Cores. The Tainted will always appear in the world through Rifts that open up mid-air. Below are two types of Tainted.
Tainted Warrior

The Tainted Warriors complement the corresponding Majestic souls that once must have lived in this rocky, harsh environment. Their bodies are sparsely covered with light pieces of armor and other generic garments, with distinguishably larger plates covering other parts of the body - mostly around the shoulders and knees.
Tainted Bruiser

The Tainted Bruisers are much like the Tainted Warriors. Visually, they differ in that their waists are wrapped in steel armor sheets and legs are supported and protected. Their free-flowing thick strands of hair can be seen at the back of their head, reaching halfway down their backs.

Jiankra

The Jiankra is a large carnivore that appropriates items from its surroundings, be they natural or manufactured, and uses these items as crude yet effective camouflage.
Forsaken (The Goal)

Despite their colossal size, these wild beasts have eluded researchers for ages. Rumors from the Guard suggest that Titans enslaved by Lukasin are instrumental in protecting the Ether cores from Athern reclamation.

Forsaken (The Discovery Goal)

Ok, but why mobile? Because it is one of the most popular platforms of today and <strong>narrative based gameplay</strong> just fits it very well.

Can you make moral and ethical decisions with severe consequences? Are you ready to sacrifice everything for the greater good? These are the questions you will find the answers for during multiple playthroughs of the game.In our singleplayer mobile-optimized game you can swipe in the four basic directions to move, do actions, find loot or even fight in the encounters. When you die - and trust us you will die many times - you will gain experience from your previous lives and in the next game you might travel a bit farther away. Over time you will remember which event does what effect on your character but just when you think you know everything, something unexpected happens and you die again. But dont worry, we give you rewards and achievements everytime you find something new on this brutal world. Swipe Chapters: Fallen Mankind is not a lighthearted, family-friendly story. All the narratives, the conversations with other characters and other lore materials deepen the connection with this savage and unforgiving world. We wanted to create a mature storyline for adult gamers, who love challenging and hardcore plays. You are a survivor of the old world, your primary task is to get supplies to your colony, and exploration of the new world driven by curiosity. Not only natural anomalies, mutated living creatures, traps, diseases are a danger to the player but also survivors of other factions.We drew inspiration from many other creation like Reigns, Fallout, The Binding of Isaac, Mad Max, Stalker and so on. We love these works and we are greatly passionate about creating a similarly spectacular living world.Which way is the safest to the next supplies? Can I eat that thing on the ground that looks so tasty? Can I make room for another valuable loot to trade with the Nomads if I drop my secondary weapon?All these decisions are up to you, and every step you make is going to lead towards different consequences, and finally you will see multiple endings of the storyline depending on the path you have chosen during your endeavours. Hidden behind the scenes, a point based system is monitoring everything about your game actions. You gain alignment score for your behavior in different situations and gain honor or hatred points from faction members. When certain circumstances are met, you will get new event cards as a result of your previous decisions.The basic game mechanics are about surviving in the wild. You have to keep the balance of your main stats: health, hunger, thirst and supplies. If any of these drops to zero, you will suffer the conditions.There are numerous secondary stats like strength, agility, endurance, intelligence, luck, fame, and alignment points. Each of these stats are gained or lost by card decisions, and lets you choose which way to develop your character. When finding some loot, you can decide to pick it up and manage the simplified inventory.The basic combat mechanism is similar to the other elements of the game. You can swipe in different directions to take actions, like attack, counterattack (reflect), use special abilities or items from your inventory.Swipe Chapters: Fallen Mankind awaits you with many encounters on the road that lies beneath your feet. You can solve some of these peacefully, but mostly you will have to fight for your victory. To populate these desolate lands we are creating diverse factions, who have their own motives, lifestyles, habits and goals. Each one of the faction members has their own statistics, some of them always try to trade, others want to eat you. There are a range of options to choose from like talking, trading, gambling or flirting... and if these are not sufficient for your playstyle, you can always fight your way through the world. Survivors: You are not the one and only Looter on the surface world. Before you, there were many other members of your community going through the wilderness. Nomads: These people are the desert raiders, the looter kings who would sell their own mother for a more shiny loot. Wildlife: The surface world has its own mutated and evolutionary developed creatures and vegetation. Butchers: Almost like animals, they only have basic instincts like to breathe, to eat, and to f*ck. They believe in blood and bones, and many of them are cannibals. Coalition: The remains of the strong military groups after the Great Cataclysm. They have the power and knowledge to create their own society with strict rules and rationed supplies. Our Artist has created a breathtaking art style to give life to our project. We are planning to make more than 150 unique and different card graphics with many filters and card animations. Not just cards, but other elements like UIs are a crucial part of the game’s graphics design process. We want to give players a full and consistent view of all aspects. So what is our recipe for a good card design? Check these before-after images to understand our design steps.We also love long gameplays but if you have only a few minutes to play with Swipe Chapters: Fallen Mankind, you'll still have plenty of fun. Gameplay-wise there are random generated cards and a complex diverse story with different consequences to lengthen the gametime. When the game has ended, you can play again and create more random factors to achieve more goals. In order to increase the replayability factor we include gaming elements such as difficulty levels, multiple endings, unlockable characters with unique traits, card-fitted filters that give new experiences by altering the known mechanics, regular free DLCs, daily and monthly level challenges.We have been aim to avoid one of the biggest disadvantage of today's mobile games and thrown out the whole energy system so there is nothing to break the constant gaming experience. The game will analyze all of your playthroughs so you can see all the previous awards and statistics before playing again. Of course we implement easy, hard and hidden achievements and highscores for players who love collecting and sharing their results on social profiles.

We also ask you all to please share your creative ideas. So send them to us via email or fill out the Ask a Question form on the top of this site.Bright Hobo Studio is a small Hungarian indie developer team. The passion and creativity comes from our alliance and the desire to create an extraordinary game for mobile platforms. Most of the time when we think of mobile gaming it's the casual games that comes to our minds. And of course when people are browsing the Play Store, the games they find are often poorly designed, include a lot of grinding, filled with microtransactions or just simply repetitive and boring.That's what we want to change by creating quality mobile games. Ok, but why mobile? Because it is one of the most popular platforms of today and narrative based gameplay just fits it very well. Our team not designed for only one game, we plan to make a franchise out of it. We are currently at the beginning of our development phase and everything you see in the campaign is from the Alpha version. The final version may be different from what you see here, so everything is a subject to change. So we believe in ourselves and we ask You to put Your faith in us as well. You are not going to regret it!Our team left to right:Gábor Németh (developer),Balázs Szöllősi (story),and Manó Megyeri (art) - a grumpy dude because he can’t grow a beardAlthough the game is primarily developed for Android, but we want to expand it and make the game available for iOS and PC, depending on the success of the campaign. After the release the game will be available trough Play Store and App Store, or alternatively you can play them on a PC through a browser. Over time, it will be also release on Steam and other digital distribution platforms for greater publicity.   We believe in community power and the greatness of crowdsourcing. The total incoming amount of the campaign funds will be spent on developing the game. We are still in the early stages of development, spending $1,700 and 2 months of planning so far. To finish the final game we need Your support to bring our dream to life. We decided to launch a fixed-goal campaign so that the game will be finished only if we have the full financial security for creating a high quality product. If our campaign does not meet its goal by the deadline, all the backers will be refunded by Indiegogo within 5-7 business days. This chart will tell about the segments of the income distribution. We would like to provide different options for a greater scalability for everyone. With each bundle you receive special digital rewards when the delivery time comes. As you see below the Rusher perk is the only Early Bird that has quantity limitations. When that reaches 150 units it will be deactivated and will be unavailable after that. Every other package will be available until the end of the campaign. So let's see the detailed perk list and the digital rewards for every price tag.For additional information you can visit us on our official website.

The only way to walk over the totem is to stop just right on its path.

</div></div>","Pycel is a strategic board game based on the original snakes and ladders. Aside from only using a rolling die, we totally created the whole new way of playing. We use cards instead of dice, we use strategy instead of luck! In Pycel, the snakes and ladders are changed into the movable arrows, which you can move them wherever you want. There are 4 different level of cards. All the cards, boards, and items are carefully designed based on modern material design. Number of player: 2-6 playersTime: 15-60 minutesAge: 8+
Note: All materials in our video are just the prototype. 

The size of board and cards are 297x297mm and 63x88mm respectively.

“Learn how to play in just 30 seconds”Rules are simple, everyone can learn and play in less than a half minute (but to win would take more than that).
Whoever travel to the center first wins.
To move your token or do actions, you use cards.
To use cards, you pay coins. 
To pay coins, you passively collect 2 coins each turn or step on specific paths. 
Have fun!

Our Board
The first revolution is our board. In the original board, you have to walk in a zigzag way and sometimes you have to look at the numbers to see whether you have to go left or right. In our material designed board, it is much simpler, you just walk in clockwise direction! There will be 3 kinds of  special paths on the board, more coins, more actions, and draw star level cards.

There are also totems and arrows which will be explained below. For Special Edition Pycel, the board will be made of metal and all tokens, arrows, and totems of will have a magnet attached in the bottom in order for nice contacting with the board and preventing any unintentionally movements. No more problem of accidentally hit the table and all tokens are dislocated.

Cards
Cards are the most important part of Pycel. To win this game, you have to wisely use those cards to walk in the right position, knock down your lovely friends, and find the fastest way to travel to the center. There are 4 level of cards; level 1, level 3, level 5, and star level.“Controlling your movement”Level  1 - contains 1 to 6 faces of the dice. Use them to move on your desirable path.“Using special powers”Level 3 - action cards, one time use only.“Flip the situation”Level 5 - continuous cards, pay coins to use their effects.“Unpredictable”Star level - randomly good and bad cards according to your situation.Three of each Level 1,3, and 5 cards will be face up beside the board, so you can choose which cards you want to buy. If your desired cards are not there, you can choose to buy an ambiguous face down card from the deck but with the special card. You can buy cards for yourself or for preventing others to get them. For the star cards, when you stop on a star path, a star card will be drawn.Coins“Plan your strategies according to your resources”You will get coins from a certain income, certain paths, and ‘maybe’ from a star level card. Use them prudently in order to win the game. During your turn, you get 2 coins as an income. Then, to use cards, you need to pay for it. The costs of cards are indicated in their levels, for example, you have to pay 3 coins to buy one level 3 card, 5 coins for one level 5 card. When you stop on the more coins path, take 3 coins.Items“Go up, down or bounce back”There are 2 kinds of items on the board; arrows and totems.Arrows - Once your token stops on the path where an arrow's tail lays on, your token immediately warps to the path that its arrow's head lays on. The arrows can also be moved around the board by using a card effect. So you can move them to your desired path, to move your token up, or to move others down. There are 3 different sizes of arrows; short, medium, and long. Two arrows of each size will be placed on the board, total of 6 arrows.Totems - There will be 3 totems in the board. Totems act like the barriers. If your token must move beyond the totem, it bounces back. For instance, if a totem is 2 steps ahead of your token and you play 6 steps card, your token moves 2 steps forward then bounces back 4 steps. The only way to walk over the totem is to stop just right on its path. After that, that totems is yours, you can move it wherever you want on the board (my advice is to move it to block your friends path). There is also an action card that you can use to move a totem.

The paths that the cursed totem have moved over are also cursed, which means that any tokens that travel to the path that the cursed totem already passed are also eliminated. In this mode, the players can choose to move their tokens forward or backward and any cards that affect normal totems have no effect with the cursed one.
$100000 - Party game mode - Remove all coins from play, all cards have no costs, no face up cards, the action limit per turn is expanded to 2. Each player draw 2 cards from each pile. At each player turn, draw 2 more cards from any piles of your choice and play as normally. To use level 5 cards, pay them with level 1 cards that have equal or higher number of steps than number of coins required. For example, in normal mode, to use a king of arrow card effect, you have to pay 2 coins. In this mode, you have to sacrifice one of face 2,3,4,5,or 6 dice cards. To be more fun, the additional cards below will be added.
Flip the Board!! - Discard all your cards, skip your next turn. Starting point is now Finishing point and vice versa. All dice have negative values. You may not use this card if there are any tokens at Start.

3rd round lucky - At the beginning of your 3rd turn after the activation of this card, whoever is in the most front position goes back to the start.
Brain control - This turn only, take control of another player token.
SphILF’s punishment - Choose a player, that player skips his next turn.
Give them to me - Swap your cards with any player.

She doesn't remember, what's happened to her and she doesn't know, where she is. Will you help her to remember everything? Overcome the fears? Find the way home? Or you will live her alone in such ominous place forever?</p><div>
<h3>Game world</h3>
<p>Events take place in a house full of mysteries, fears and unexplained things. Whether the main character will pass this terrible and dangerous way or not – depends on you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>The main factor is finding certain items, solving puzzles and surviving. Looped levels will lead you astray. You will think that deja vu, but in fact it is not. Some puzzles may seem very difficult, but in fact they are very easy, just presented so that it is really hard. The main feature of the gameplay is endless pursuit. An antagonist in every way will prevent you from going all the way, maybe he is not even alone ?!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Mechanics</h3>
<p>Everything is simple - you have health, endurance, a flashlight and fear. Fear in the game is the key moment, if it is beyond the limit, the player begins to hallucinate, you can die or be caught by the antagonist (which also entails death). Endurance and flashlight are directly dependent and adapt to the level of difficulty of the game (there are only four levels). Difficulty levels are well balanced to the point that certain scenes (not key) are skipped at a lighter level. There are also items to interact with. Character cold system, which is very easy to interact with. A quick event system (QTE) that requires your reaction. There is also a choice of action, you can choose which way the main character will take, just be careful, everything can be changed from your choice. </p>

<p>Hi, I am Shiba Prasad Das. I am a self-taught game developer. I have worked in other people’s game projects, but this one is my first own game project.

For the first time, you can have virtual reality without the need for other attachments, simply point and shoot.  The concept of the game is to save worlds at war from unstoppable forces that seek to destroy all life. Each planet consists of a specific number of days of war that bring increasingly difficult enemies with each day you advance. Traveling to distant planets across the galaxy will surprise you with who the enemy is, how advanced they are and even what era they're in.  In this horde FPS you will drop into each world with ultimate powers derived from your ship, the Altor. Without these powers you may be crushed by the gravity alone on each planet. Due to these restrictions you only have the ability to rotate 360 degrees, but not move forward, backward, left or right. Movement is controlled with real world or touch screen rotation. This allows for extreme precision and accuracy when playing. So whether it be casting spells, shooting arrows or launching grenades you will have complete physical control over the outcome of each projectile in an advanced physics driven environment.Multiplayer is a king of the hill game mode in which 10 players play as enemy invaders and one player plays as the hero. Outnumbered 10 to 1 you will need to be quick, accurate and smart in order to defeat the other players. Being the enemy allows instant re-spawning and infinite lives, but lack of power. To win as the enemy you must defeat the hero before the sun sets. To win as the hero, you must survive.  With a wide range of spells, weapons and powers you have the ability to wreak havoc upon your enemies in numerous ways. All weapons have the capability to be upgraded to more powerful versions from the weapon smith based on The Altor. Companions for each world will help you in battling to save their planet. They also provide the option to replay any day you previously completed to achieve high scores and get more shards!   A while back I didn't have the money for a virtual reality system, so I looked for an alternative for a VR game to play that didn't require the additional expenses of extra attachments to my phone, computer or console. I looked and found nothing. So I decided to create a game that gives the look and feel of a VR video game without going through the hassle of spending a fortune.This is a solo project that I started 2 years ago. It's now in the final development stages and needs the finishing touches. I, unfortunately, am not able to do everything myself so am in need of help. I'll need funds to hire a few professionals to help me with:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Dexter Kennedy, I am a Retired US Army Warrant Officer and former martial arts competitor. After twenty-eight years of competition, in 2003 I came up with a strategy to graduate tournament-level martial arts to professional best-of-the-best team champions by way of a professional point team league.  I am now making my strategy, available nationwide via a martial arts video game, DK's KumiteSport 2020. Through DK’s KumiteSport 2020, I am providing 480 martial artists the opportunity to have their likeness, techniques and fighting strategy incorporated as a team player in the video game. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>The campaign is needing to raise $20,000 of which 65% will go to paying for the design, development, programming and packaging of the game itself. The other 35% will go to providing supporters what they paid for in the form of pledges and awards.</li>
<li>Our most unique perk is to actually have a martial artists likeness, favorite executable techniques and fight strategy designed as a player in the video game. Thereby increasing their chance to become a martial arts superstar.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Football, amateur and professional, is perhaps the most popular spectator sport in the United States. Attracting over 40 million in attendance and many more millions in television viewership each year. I believe that it is more realistic to expand kumite, along with its sports audience via a video game with real world stars then the current tournament landscape. Through this campaign, a player can pledge to help support the creation of the game and later become an overnight sensation from the exposure of the game itself. </p>
<p>KumiteSport, the video game provides maximum opportunity for martial artists, male and female, ages 21 and up, looking for a platform that will increase recognition and popularity within the martial arts industry. Over time the franchise team concept will be embraced and one day become a reality and emulate the success of other professional league team franchises.  </p>
<p>For decades in America, various genres of the martial arts have languished within the limitations of their respective communities.  Now, KumiteSport and the team idea is making a powerful move in introducing the world to the concept of professionalizing the amateur martial arts tournament-level competition into a major league team sport by way of a video game. </p>
<p>A nationwide league with the potential to expand globally can be more inclusive of martial artists than any existing martial arts platform. In addition to physical fitness and mental conditioning, KumiteSport is a opportunity to envision the possibilities in a professional martial arts team league which can offer excellent career opportunities for coaches, referees, and front office administrative personnel.  Coaches receive experience by working with competitors and preparing fight strategies while referees are presented with a challenge of officiating fast-paced, action-packed events.  People involved with management aspects of the organization gain unparalleled experience and insight into the operation of a professional sports franchise.  Franchisees also become more involved within their communities by providing a professional sports team, which becomes an active vehicle for recreation, community service and economic profitability. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>""We've been working on professionalizing sport martial arts since 2003, this is our fourth phase with</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1:</strong> being franchising which failed,</p>
<p><strong>Phase 2:</strong> taking the concept and strategy and outlining it in a book, Taking on the NFL: The National Martial Arts League, which protected the idea,</p>

<h3>What did ""The Billiards Regal"" experience?</h3>
<p><br/>For this billiards product, our team was initially developed by 4 engineers, 2 designers, and 2 artists.

We need your support to develop the subsequent nine-ball game mode, which will make this game more fun. ! Sincerely, we hope to get your help and make this game more perfect!<br/>We need a sum of money to help us keep running. Then, we can invite more talented developers to join us. This fund is approximately US$ 50,000 to US$ 100,000. We will use this money to develop the nine-ball game mode, event content and some peripheral functions in the next three months. We need more developers to join in.<br/>If we do not achieve the expected funding goal, we will also use this money for the polishing and improvement of existing products, and strive to present the player with the best quality 3D billiard game.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Personnel risks. We need to recruit more friends to join in the project. There are some risks brought by people. For example, new members need times to integrate well, and the code quality needs more energy to maintain, and so on.</p>
<p>Development risk. With the iteration of the version, we will add a lot of social elements. This will involve a lot of data interaction and data maintenance. This is both a risk and a challenge for the R&amp;D team. The team has confidence ensures that the core gameplay is superior and fun, and that the social part will be the best.

<h3>How will ""Pool Rich"" face and solve these problems?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>From the beginning of the project, we have been dedicated to every function and details. In order to give everyone a better operational feeling, we invited professional billiard players to help us adjust the impact, alignment, striking strength, and arc. content. Although we have to face other more challenging tasks in the later period, we all have the confidence to do a good job. We will recruit more outstanding developers to join in and spend more time studying the game mode and polishing This game, I believe will give players a best and most authentic billiard game!</p>

In order to give everyone a better operational feeling, we invited professional billiard players to help us adjust the impact, alignment, striking strength, and arc. content. Although we have to face other more challenging tasks in the later period, we all have the confidence to do a good job. We will recruit more outstanding developers to join in and spend more time studying the game mode and polishing This game, I believe will give players a best and most authentic billiard game!",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div></div></div>","The Bone is a free-to-play mobile AR game that combines components from RPG and sports in a real-life environment. Using three elements of technology: your smartphone, augmented reality, and electronics, we deliver:The experience of having superpowers in real lifeHere, you are the main character, the world is your stage, and our technology is the medium that will let you live this experience.We created a Demo for you to take a glimpse into our Universe, and to test out the Mobile Only experience without an Epon, click to download: If you acquire a Caster Gear you will you will have access to both the mobile and real-life gameplay experiences (solo and multiplayer). Train and fight with local players in real life or with the entire player base in an online mode.  Actual Gameplay 1vs 1 using the built-in recording & streaming feature. 

 

 Each time you fight, you will select your loadout from the dozens of available powers. This means that each battle will have different strategies depending on the conditions of that specific match. If you wish, you could deal huge amounts of damage, heal your allies, use shields, paralyze your enemies or hundreds of more combinations for you to discover.The world is your stage and, as long as you have internet access, you can play anywhere.  Picture yourself in an abandoned building playing a 2 vs 2 capture the flag match,  or gathering with 10 friends in your local park  to play a battle royal, or a 1 vs 1 duel in your backyard.You select the location and create the rules. We intend to let the community build and create different game modes. The system is based on the idea that this is a sport and should be treated that way. Some days, you will have amazing fights in real-life arenas, but other days you must train.If you own an Epon, you can battle other players online with specific augmented reality gameplay designed to sharpen your skills while battling with other recruits worldwide.The Bone is all about superpowers and your ability to summon and cast them. In our universe they are called Power Archives. The other resources revolve around them, and mastering them should be the focus of your training. How many exist is a mystery, but we have discovered 36 so far.Each Power Archive has a unique series of movements, or Casting Pattern, that you must perform to use them. An essential part of your training is mastering these patterns to perform them precisely. You don’t need a Caster Gear to be a part of our Universe. We developed a stand alone mobile experience where you will explore the world, gather resources, level up your powers and fight other players in the combat simulator.  We think it is better if you test it yourself, therefore we created a Demo. Click to download:To begin your adventure, you'll only need your phone. Using its camera and our Augmented Reality system, you will explore your surroundings to find superpowers, along with the resources you'll need to level them up.Consider this is not a GPS-based game. Depending on the actual colors and textures you explore are the resources you will find, so pay attention to your surroundings. Superpowers could be anywhere.

 

If you don't own an Epon, you can access the Combat simulator with your phone at any time.  An online multiplayer arena for you to test your powers, try new strategies, practice with your teammates, and gain experience before going into real-life battles



 

 

Nereas are your virtual companions and training partners.  They are entirely cosmetic and will not have any impact on the game mechanics or your performance. However, they will make you look amazing when fighting online. You know what they say: if you look good, you feel good, and if you feel good, you play good.

Collect them all and show them off with your friends!

 

Recruitment Centers (RC´s) are the real-life point of contact of our community with The Bone.  Through a special section of our app, RC owners will create and organize tournaments and training sessions, and players will find and book matches near them.
In an RC, players will use their smartphones and profiles, and may bring their Caster Gear or rent one at the Recruitment Center, even if you don’t own an Epon, you can still fight with the Power Archives you have worked hard to level up.  This locations are a great way to meet fellow recruits, practice your casting technique, participate in official tournaments and trade in-game assets!

""Spoko and Poko is promarily a brilliant idea, very challenging and demanding gameplay and a huge number of levels. ALL THIS makes that we are dealing with a unique production.""
It is the opinion of one of the greatest Polish portals dedicated to mobile applications.  antyweb.plSpoko and Poko is a story about two beetles carrying balls to their house. The game in its convention refers to many classics from the turn of the 80-ies and 90-ies. It is an entertainment for many hours of playing; sometimes it is surprisingly funny and for sure very addictive.             
At the beginning of January of this year, we released Spoko and Poko for devices with Android trying to market it on our own; the result achieved by us - a few thousand downloads. We know that our game deserves much much more. Now, richer in experience from the past, we want to release it with some big changes for devices with the iOS, Win, OSX system.                                    We would like the users of iOS system to be able to enjoy our game without micropayments. We believe that micropayments effectively ruin fun and often promote only the payers. We want to change it - the balance of the game may not be dependent on the wallet. Do Leaderboards make any sense in such a case?However, we have to remember every developer spent a lot of time and money to create a game.

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There really isn't any risk to you in terms of the game being completed since I won't be doing flexible funding with this.  That means the only way I'll work on this game is if I can raise the full $600 which will allow me enough breathing room to work on this for a week! :D  If it was any lower I would still have to balance time between this and my pedal business, and that wouldn't be good for anyone. :(</p>
<p>The biggest risk and challenge right now is that I am still relatively green when it comes to build video games.  Although I feel very confident creating tiny games, I'm still weary of making larger ones in which bigger bugs and system compatibility issues will become more and more of a challenge.</p>
<p>There is no doubt in my mind I will meet this challenge, and the games I am making right now, including this one, will be small enough to not warrant too much concern, but it's still on my mind.</p>

<p>The first of the presented game locations is 8 * 8 km of the beautiful forest landscapes of the island. We have created many wild forests and lakes to give a natural feeling. In all these locations, you can build defensive forts and fight, except for safe zone locations. These locations are bases in which there are security zones. In order to obtain resources and development you will have to build your own shelter outside these walls.</p>

Be sure to improve all the elements of construction: the foundation, walls, doors, and roof, because if at least one element is not improved, it will break and easily allow unwanted entry.<br/><img alt=""BattleBeasts survival game"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://playbattlebeasts.com/images/gif/gameplay_destroy.gif"" src="""" style=""width:100%;height:100%;""/></p>

The first of the presented game locations is 8 * 8 km of the beautiful forest landscapes of the island. We have created many wild forests and lakes to give a natural feeling. In all these locations, you can build defensive forts and fight, except for safe zone locations. These locations are bases in which there are security zones. In order to obtain resources and development you will have to build your own shelter outside these walls.
Also, game locations include many abnormal areas with high risk to life. Day-night changes allow you to use different gameplay solutions for exploring the riddles of the planet and getting different types of resources. Take back control of the world. Learn the secrets of the planet to gain more new items.

BUILDING
Using available resources such as wood and stone, you can build your own shelters.First, choose where you are going to build, it is desirable that this would be on an even and large enough area. If the image is red, then you cannot install it there, if it is green, you can. Be sure to improve all the elements of construction: the foundation, walls, doors, and roof, because if at least one element is not improved, it will break and easily allow unwanted entry.

INVENTORY SYSTEM
In BattleBeasts. there is a system for numerous items to research. Branches of study for new items and the study of their settings with their own characteristics, such as weapons, armor, and transportation, will allow numerous settings. Objects contain many unique properties, allowing you to customize weapons and more for your style of play.We use a grid-based inventory system that allows you to plan, save resources, and create craft items. We made interaction with objects the most realistic. You will be able to unpack boxes of ammunition and open storage with various tools that can be found in the world.

RESOURCES
The main available resources are for construction, while less available are the resources necessary for life (water, food). There are also completely unique quest resources used to recharge batteries in vehicles, upgrading shelters, crafting unique items, and many more.The more unique a resource is, the less accessible it is. You can get it from dangerous mobs and in remote anomalous places.

HAZARDOUS FORMS OF LIFE
The island filled with monsters and robots is the basis of a new game mechanics, created with C ++.Combat cyborgs, robots left without owners, show aggression to all intelligent species. We will fill the game with more lively and fast elements of the gameplay, in the form of wild animals that will behave most naturally in their habitat. Only the fastest and most cunning players can catch Mobs. Mobs are equipped with motion sensors, they perfectly see in the dark, they react to sounds, explosions and they are damn hard to kill or catch.

These days we want to pay your attention to the key features of our current project ""Lingermia"".</p><p>In this single-user horror intertwines the mysterious mythology of ancient Egypt and the gloomy side of Victorian England – its folklore and events. Particular attention is given to a dreary, oppressive atmosphere, which was formed on the base of an epidemic, famine and mysterious murders. From the very first minutes it becomes evident that the situation around is no longer to be saved and it is worth only thinking about saving ourselves.</p><p>Wandering through the eerie corners of the «Lingermia"" world, you will face with not only the natural problems of England of that time, but also spiritual forces, from which it is not so easy to escape ... However, in spite of the horror that has already filled everything up to the foundation, you will play for the main character, who can still bring a piece of light into this dark realm of death. Moreover, in the game you will find lots of references to real or fictional events that have become a dispensable part of the history of Victorian England. At the same time, the events are not developing chaotically here, but according to the plot in the spirit of the best films and books of similar themes. We, as developers, were inspired by such famous works as «Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde» by Robert Lewis Stevenson, «Dracula» by Bram Stoker, «Plague» by Albert Camus as well as such films as «Van Helsing» by Stephen Sommers, «Sweeney Tod: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street» and Tim Burton's «Sleepy Hollow». It should be noted that the backgroound music of «Lingermia"" is also an important aspect. The mysterious, uncanny, often frightening and tense music will accompany you during the game.</p><p>The gameplay itself will not distract the players from the addictive plot, but will not let you relax either – there are many different dangers in the game which you will have to cope with regularly, and only at times you will be able to take a breath.</p><p>In general, the «Lingermia» horror is a gloomy essence of fear, skilfully mixed with the no less friendly atmosphere of the reality of the past centuries. As developers we want to pay attention to all of the existing aspects of the genre of horror, and introduce something new creating a unique project of its kind. No doubt, it will be difficult for us to do it without your support, our dear players, therefore, we count upon your help</p><p><strong>The gameplay</strong></p><p>During the game you will hardly have the opportunity to fight, and therefore the main task is to survive. Walk around obstacles, hide, run, use the game world by which you are surrounded to your advantage, unravel secrets and find ancient relics including a strange bracelet.</p><p>The stealth mode will be implemented in this game for the greater efficiency of which you will have to take care of the details. Otherwise, you have to run like hell hoping that you will not be caught. And the most interesting is that you do not know what each of them will do with the character. ''Sometimes death is too boring''.</p><p>Do not forget that in order to learn more secrets you have to take risks more often and make up ways to solve problems. With each step there will be more secrets and it would be better not to miss the opportunity to trace at least one thread in this vast web of secrets.There will be a rather unusual mode of complexity of the game. There will be available a choice of a bone structure for the main character in addition to lighting, which will directly influence her abilities during the game.

  Team membersAndrew Didenko – everybody who is familiar with this fellow personally knows about his passion for games and observation developers' approach to different detail. Thanks to his  ambitions and principles, he  helps to realize the team's first dream. And he has already taken very important place of all our project: one of the founders of the team ""Kava-projects"", programmer, author. Despite of the difficulties, this guy is ready to move with the times and work generously took the time. To find out something new, to learn, to implement, to attempt, to seek a way out of the impasse. Perhaps, these words can emphasize his  qualities.Andrew Karpov – from the very first second when this person has already been adult enough to keep in the hands a PC mouse everything that he did was aimed to the fact to find out as many games and their origins as possible at all. If there is at least some new, or unexplored nuance, or aspect in game development, he will be willing to learn it quickly or he will find a person, who will help him to tell and teach others. One of the founders of the team ""Kava-projects"", programmer, author and just a person who loves games so much that can give you some of them. Anastasiia Kostina is the young lady who one of the few people was able to refute the theory ""in order to create games – you should play a lot». From the childhood she has been the person interested in design, whose eyes see the missing trivia and are able to turn a beautiful item into the masterpiece. Unlike many of us, she was looking for herself too long, but she   has found the place where she is interested to work in. Lots of what you will see in this game is created by this person, who worked hard and tried to implement something great in the team development. Bohdan Hrishchenko is a talented singer who thanks to his musical accompaniment will keep you in the voltage. Author of a number of ideas, adjustments, stories, which will let the world be more real, more than this, more interesting.       Julia Smakovskaya is a translator, reminiscent to the game’s developers that even in the awful nightmare a romance should take place. And a little bit of erotic. And the most important is to bring this game as many different native language speakers, as she will be able to.     Viktoriia Bespalova is another person who helps to share our project with a lot of people. What can be better than the author's translation? Correct! Only the author's translation with voice acting. From the very childhood she was fond of learning foreign languages and at the same time wanted to work on the radio. These days she is with us trying to apply her skills, talents and the desire into something really head-spinning.   Oksana Azarova is an artist who loves games with good quality no less than drawing for them. In breaks between drawing arts for the game she draws Till Lindeman and hopes that in this horror there would be a place for the terrible German musician. Thanks God, not to the most awful German artist. So far.     Ksenia Sokolovskaya - one of the most faithful critic-consultants of the game. Using her startling voice, she helps the team to affect, to interest and even to scare you much more.       Taisiia Silkina is an artist whose images inspired developers with a sense of the majestic, mysterious, dangerous and tempting places which you have to see in the game. It is very important in our ocupation to pass all the game's atmosphere and environment for a player , and without good artist in such a case it is hardly possible.    Risks Risk and challenges. The development of any project is not risk free and there are no guarantees in life. Despite the fact that we are really a small team and every day we face with new difficulties, we always find the solution. We know and see how to achieve what we want and the closer we approach to our goal, the better we do it. We see a lot of ideas, their implementation and potential, but for the creation such a high-quality and volume game, we need to spend a lot of time and resources. The resources are limited and that’s why it is not enough to the embody the ideas in such way as we feel it, or for their implementation at all. Financial support is essential for us, because due to it depends the diversity and technical component of the game and speed of their implementation.Raised funds will be used to improve the lighting, diversity and quality of the materials, number and quality of the characters, their animation, a variety of high-quality and picturesque scenes, as well as a variety of games as a whole. We are confident in our strength to implement our dream, which, of course, will be able to please fans of the genre of horror with new open game world.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Token System</h3>
<p>A Master is given tokens to initiate interaction with a host. Cocktail Tokens are used in the Sky Bar, while Coffee Tokens are used in the Beach Cafe. You have full control on how you spend your tokens, and each token is priced at $3 (discounted to $2 for backers). Initiating a session costs 1 token with a 10-minute countdown, easily visible over the website. You can easily extend your time with the Extend Timer button at a cost of 1 Token. You can also give tips to your host with your tokens. All Transactions are easily tracked and recorded instantly in Master Ledger inside your Master Sanctum.  The Token System will give full control on your experience with us, as we want to give you freedom and transparency to enjoying our service. </p>
<h3>About  Us</h3>
<p>My name is Roberto, and my career as a nurse lead me to realize the holistic need of humans.  I have personally experienced how stress and emotional strains can bring you down and prevent you from being effective in your goals. Furthermore, accumulation of these bad vibes makes us more susceptible from being tired and failure due to exhaustion. Some are lucky to have a support group to help them in need, but support groups are not always available.  So together with my trusted friends and professional freelance instructors, we want to create a virtual host club where you can easily and conveniently find a professional to help you in the difficult situations and recharge yourself. </p>
<p>Together with our team of graphic designers, programmers, business administration consultants and our expert hosts, we would like to bring you a comfortable, secure environment to express yourself and have a companion ever supportive and caring for your needs. </p>
<h3>Our Goal for the Service:</h3>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Inspiration is something that you can never have too much of. We all go through life, trying to achieve our professional goals, trying to find rewarding relationships, trying to reach a spiritual understanding, and sometimes, the challenges before </span>us<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> can seem a little overwhelming. You can get food, water, and shelter any number of ways, but when it comes inspiration and internal support, the path forward is not always quite so clear-cut. This is where Wellcalm Master comes into the pictures. </span></p>
<p>A Virtual Host Club, Welllcalm Master makes companionship more accessible than ever. Helping you to do all that you want to do and be all that you can be. Our platform is designed to move people away from their negative habits and toward their best possible selves. There is no reason that you need to go on daydreaming about rising up from your current situation: you can turn that daydream into reality, and we can help you along the way. Your emotional needs will finally be under your control!</p>
<h3>Our Funding Goal Explained</h3>
<p>We have come to you, Indiegogo, in order to raise the start-up capital that we need to bring Wellcalm Master to life. Our current funding goal is $500, and every dollar that we raise toward that goal helps tremendously. $500 will help us maintain a secure domain, free of advertisements and harmful things throughout your Master Experience. To provide easy and interactive functions on the website, we will need to purchase premium apps for an easy and dynamic experience for our users. We set our goal to the minimum as we would like to invite users to use the service and have a continuous partnership towards making an amazing journey on a Master's life. </p>
<p>As a thank-you, we have put together some exciting rewards, just our way of showing our appreciation for your crucial role in getting this inspiration platform up and running!</p>
<p>How do you quantify support that will make it possible for you to find emotional and spiritual peace? This is a priceless commodity and one that we are excited to make more accessible than it has ever been before. Water, food, these are things that you can get anywhere: inspiration is harder to find, and when you do find it, you want to hold onto it. Wellcalm Master is going to make it dramatically easier for people throughout the world to find the inspiration they so seriously need in their lives.</p>
<p>Because Wellcalm Master is based on such a novel idea, this idea that inspiration does not need to be so difficult to find, it is going to take some effort to find an audience at first. We are convince, however, that once we start building our initial audience, people will start to take to the platform in droves. Whatever challenges arise along the way, we will be ready to face them intelligently.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Aside from making a monetary contribution, you can show your support for what we are doing by spreading the word about our campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and any other social media platforms you use. The more people know what we are doing, the smoother our launch will go. Your support is appreciated. Thank you!</p>

<h3>Fectar contributes to a Sustainable Future</h3>
<p><strong>Reduce carbon footprint and waste</strong><br/>Fectar enables working together on an average smartphone from everywhere and save time and energy. Augmented Reality reduces carbon footprints by negating the need for travel and by reducing resources used to plan real-world activities. People can share their work in Fectar and collaborate effectively in an AR workspace unconstrained by the need for physical spaces. </p>
<p><strong>Test and use a virtual product before its build</strong><br/>Fectar also allows us to imagine and test new machines and objects long before the need to build them. With the Fectar app you can do training simulations to perfect design of new tools. AR technologies can help reduce the number of physical prototypes required in the visual design process, thereby reducing material waste.</p>
<p><strong>Learning made easy</strong><br/>Learning with virtual object means less use of physical resources. </p>
<p><strong>Fectar can help you imagine a better future</strong><br/>Our 3D presentations can improve understanding of sustainability issues. </p>

<h3>Risk &amp; Challenges</h3>

People love our app (in less than 6 months time almost 1 million installs with a 4.2 rating with more than 2,500 reviews). And we made a choice to keep the app free.

<p>With Fectar Studio we want content creators, such as businesses and schools to create engaging content. That is why we have set up a licensing business model. And we have started selling our first licenses and this increases each week (even during these challenging COVID times). However our pricing is low, so we need to get a lot of businesses and schools on board to get a higher business turnover. On the other side, our costs a relatively low and limited in relation to our growth.</p>

Driven by our passion, the Nebula team has overcome numerous challenges in bringing Hubble to its current stage. We have used our own fundings to purchase large amount of different industrial switches from around the world for testing, and building of various prototypes. These prototypes (3D Print, Steel-Bending, Aluminium-Casting, Acrylic, Polycarbonate, etc) has been costly to produce due to the low MOQ (those of you in the manufacturing industry will understand).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463623266/Arduinos_b4qpwx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>Now that the design and concept is assuredly solid, we are at a critical crossroad where your pledges will help us make Hubble reach mass production stage. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We have negotiated an exceptional deal with our manufacturing partners, and will be utilizing the pledge funds for the production of manufacturing mold, procurement of fiber laser machine, as well as purchasing of necessary components.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The next portion of the funding will go into the set-up of a 400sqft assembly and storage facilities, which allows us to perform assembly and QC on the Hubble units locally, at a personal level. Yes, we are that particular about it.</div>

<div>
<h4><strong>The Highest Risk</strong></h4>
<p>The riskiest part of this campaign is essentially mechanical, the compatibility and durability of our chosen components are our highest risk since we don't manufacture them.</p>
<p>To overcome that issue, our team shortlisted components from only proven industrial brands in the industry, and have put all them (switches and controllers) through various tests by independent mechanical engineers. Through that procedure, we can confirm that the premium switches do indeed live up to their higher cost price.</p>
<p>Since then, we have also been using the same components for subsequent prototypes building and testing. Not a single component has broken down throughout the many rounds of soldering/unsoldering, and not-so-gentle handling. This successfully eliminates our biggest worry of this campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>Supply &amp; Manufacturing</strong></h4>
<p>We have set our delivery timelines by taking into account the time required for all manufactured components to reach our workshop for assembly, and then added some additional buffer period.</p>
<p>To further strengthen relationships, our team will visit the various manufacturing plants in May 2016 to ensure total accuracy of product manufacturing specifications, as well as lead time.</p>
<p>Every components will be ordered with 10% excess stock, to minimize reaction time should any component happen to be faulty-on-arrival. Ready back-up sources for every key component have also been negotiated for, and are ready to be activated with minimal delay.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4><strong>Shipment</strong></h4>
<p>All shipments traditionally face an unlikely risk of delay or even missing/lost shipment, regardless of postal companies. In such an event, kindly contact us and we will work out a solution, or replacement for you.</p>
<p>We are also working with an established private freight-forwarding company in Singapore, to bring down the shipping cost significantly for international shipping with tracking option.</p>
<p>However, if you prefer FedEx postal services, simply drop us an e-mail and we can arrange it separately for you (extra charges applies).</p>

<strong> 1. What games are support for Hubble controller ?</strong><br/>Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous, EVE Online, and any other games which allow players to bind joystick keys, will work on with Hubble.</div>
<div>
<strong style=""background-color: initial;"">2. What are the PC requirements for Hubble ?<br/></strong><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Windows 7/8/10 PC. You will also need WIFI for the iPad Mini to connect to host PC on the same network.</span>
</div>
<div>
<strong style=""background-color: initial;"">3. Where can I find 3rd-party apps for my iPad Mini ?<br/></strong><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We recommend using ROCCAT™ Power-Grid™ software for the control interface. ROCCAT has invested much effort into their eco-system, and has an GRID store full of control interface for the latest games. You can even create your own control interface and share it </span><a href=""http://www.roccat.org/en-US/Products/Gaming-Software/Power-Grid/Download/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">here</a><span style=""background-color: initial;"">.</span>
</div>
<div>
<strong style=""background-color: initial;"">4. Why only iPad Mini ? Is Android supported ?<br/></strong><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The reason why we made the difficult decision to support only iPad Mini (with Lightning Charging Port) at launch, is mainly because it has retained almost identical form factor throughout its product refresh cycles.</span>
</div>
<div>
<p>iPad Mini's strong international availability, stable performance, strategic port placements and compact size enables us to design Hubble to work in tandem in the most seamless manner.</p>
<p>At the moment, we are experimenting with several ways that we can support Android tablets, but have no ETA on that at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>5. Can I mount Hubble onto my desktop or cockpit ?</strong><br/>Yes. Hubble's back-plate is pre-drilled with VESA compatible, 75mm and 100mm thru-holes.</p>
<p><strong>6. What are the dimensions for Hubble ?</strong><br/>Approximately: L 486mm x W 262mm x H 95mm</p>
<p><strong>7. Does Hubble come with warranty ?</strong><br/>It is in our standard operating procedure to personally test each button and function of every Hubble unit we ship so that the chances of backers receiving a faulty unit will be minimized</p>
<p>On top of that, we will cover every Hubble module for 12 months (18 months if Stretch Goal is achieved) against manufacturing defects. RMA procedures will be included in the final product.</p>
<p><strong>8. Where can I buy cheap iPad Mini for Hubble ?</strong><br/>If you are purchasing an iPad Mini only for gaming with Hubble, we recommend purchasing a pre-owned iPad Mini 2/3/4 via eBay, or refurbished via Apple's online store for your country.</p>
<p><strong>Important: </strong>Please ensure that the iPad Mini that you are purchasing, comes with Lightning Charging Port, and NOT the older 30pin connector.</p>
<p><strong>9. Can I buy Hubble after the Campaign has ended ?</strong><br/>Yes. Visit our website <a href=""http://www.nebint.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>here</a> to purchase.</p>
<p><strong>10. Which countries do you ship to ?</strong><br/>United States, Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, Brunei, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam.</p>

</div></div>","Hubble is an advanced Space Simulator controller based on two individual control interface.
 

 
 
 


 
 




Simulator games are so much more than just FHD/4K graphics, and the largest screen you can get your hands on. Your sense of touch, is an extremely important aspect of immersion as well.
 



Our team has taken great care to evaluate hundreds of switches. Based on durability/performance, we have chosen industrial-grade switches from brands such as APEM and ARCOLECTRIC to bring out the true feel of flicking a real-life control switch. The overall durability and life-span of Hubble also increases dramatically due to the use of premium switches.
 
 
 



 

 
 
 


Using an iPad Mini and 3rd-party applications, Hubble is designed to bring about a whole new dimension to immersion game-play. Through visual feedback and user-customizable controls, Hubble enables you to manipulate your spaceship using natural reflexes.
 
 
 
 
 


Our team takes great care in balancing the design of Hubble module to ensure maximum functionality, while retaining its sleekness. Therefore, magnets have been utilized in various ways to improve the functionality of Hubble.
 


 
 
 


Hubble's main enclosure is manufactured using a single piece of 3mm thick, aircraft-grade aluminium via Extrusion Manufacturing method. Precise holes are then drilled (CNC) into the enclosure with pinpoint accuracy. To put it simply, imagine aluminium being forced through a mold to form a uniform shape, just like Play-Doh.
 


There are many advantages to using Extrusion Manufacturing. Due to its low batch variation and defect rate, Hubble's enclosure can be manufactured with a high level of sturdiness and uniformity. Since there are fewer tools and simplified process requirements, higher yield rates directly translates into shorter lead time, and improved supply chain logistics management.
 
 
 
 



Hubble's iPad Mini Cradle + Cover is built with a sleek and modern Bamboo material. Sourced responsibly, highly recycle and durable in nature, the use of Bamboo adds an incredibly distinct identity to Hubble's design philosophy.
 
Note: As wood are natural materials, it is not possible to manufacture every of our enclosure to look as per image. Kindly expect some variation in-terms of wood grains.
 


The iPad Mini Cradle is bonded to Hubble's main enclosure using Gorilla Glue. With its renown reputation for Holding Strength, Impact Resistance and Waterproof properties, Gorilla Glue is the dominant option for keeping Hubble's top surface screw-free.
 
Learn more about Gorilla Glue here.
 
 
 
 


When you are flying your spaceship, we want to put you right there in the moment, and that's it. There should not be multiple combination keys to memorize, nor complicated controls to master.
 

 Hubble is designed ground-up to be a companion control interface so that you can continue to use your favorite controllers. Be it Mouse + Keyboard, Flight Sticks, Dual Sticks, Wireless Controllers or any other devices, Hubble plays nice with them.
 
""You don't have to change yourself to fit Hubble, it was designed to fit you.""
 
 
 



Hubble is made to grow alongside your spaceship. Our team are already hard at work on the expansion modules for Hubble, and will be launching them shortly after currently Indiegogo pledges are completely fulfilled.

When you purchase the Customized backing option, our friendly staff will contact you by e-mail within 2 months from the end of Indiegogo campaign to confirm your choice of switch layout, and artwork (Recommended Size: 150mm x 150mm) for laser-engraving.
 




A mock-up picture with the artwork will be sent to you for approval before we begin the laser-engraving process on your unique Hubble module set.
 
 
 
 
 



 

 





 
 





Upon hitting the $200,000 stretch goal, we will unlock the incredibly cool Stealth Upgrade. This option changes your color scheme to Matt Black Sandblast finish, upgrades your iPad Cradle + Cover to Burmese Teak Wood, and brings your switches one step up to matching black variants.
 
 


Teak is widely regarded as THE premium choice for wood. An abundance of natural oils and rubber locked right into the wood grains gives it natural water-resistant properties. Teak's tight formation of thick fibers also allows woodwork to be done with minimal chipping or splitting, and holds well over years.
 
 
 
 
 


 

 
 
 


Our team is composed of mostly young adults, who lived and breathed all genre of games as we grew up. 
 

Peter literally lives and breathes entrepreneurship. He has assisted in 4 successful start-up companies, and recently left a stable career in the Immigration field to set-up Nebula Interface. Peter often claims to spot demands that are not filled in the Gaming Industry, and sees it as his mission to fill them with purposeful products.
 

Mickey is a brilliant CAD engineer, and spends his spare time on programming micro-controllers such as Arduino. With a mindset trained from his Aerospace Engineering days, Mickey drives the functionality of Hubble with religious fervor.
 

Sam is a second-generation wood craftsman, who has devoted his entire career in the art of working with solid wood. He currently owns a timber workshop, and guides the Nebula team with his wealth of experience. Since his involvement, Sam has improved the practical aspect of Hubble's enclosure by a significant margin.
 

Roy is an accredited trainer by profession, and believes in Quality over quantity. He takes charge of ensuring that all Assembly staffs are adequately trained, and often performs the task of Quality Control personally.
 
With a Degree in Marketing Communications and 5 years in the multimedia industry, Kim is a natural fit to get the word of Hubble out to the community. However, Kim claims that his job will be the simplest of the team as the Sim and Mod community people are generally a tight-knitted bunch.
 

Shirley will be the lovely lady who ensures that you get your orders made and delivered right. She is incredibly meticulous in her order management, customer service, accounting, and is best known for telling others not to 'interfere' with her work as we will only 'slow her down'.
 
 
 
 


Driven by our passion, the Nebula team has overcome numerous challenges in bringing Hubble to its current stage. We have used our own fundings to purchase large amount of different industrial switches from around the world for testing, and building of various prototypes. These prototypes (3D Print, Steel-Bending, Aluminium-Casting, Acrylic, Polycarbonate, etc) has been costly to produce due to the low MOQ (those of you in the manufacturing industry will understand).
 



Now that the design and concept is assuredly solid, we are at a critical crossroad where your pledges will help us make Hubble reach mass production stage. 
 
We have negotiated an exceptional deal with our manufacturing partners, and will be utilizing the pledge funds for the production of manufacturing mold, procurement of fiber laser machine, as well as purchasing of necessary components.
 
The next portion of the funding will go into the set-up of a 400sqft assembly and storage facilities, which allows us to perform assembly and QC on the Hubble units locally, at a personal level. Yes, we are that particular about it.
 
Help us bridge this financial gap, and let us (and Hubble) change the way you experience Space Flight.
 
 
 
 
 


The Highest Risk
The riskiest part of this campaign is essentially mechanical, the compatibility and durability of our chosen components are our highest risk since we don't manufacture them.
To overcome that issue, our team shortlisted components from only proven industrial brands in the industry, and have put all them (switches and controllers) through various tests by independent mechanical engineers. Through that procedure, we can confirm that the premium switches do indeed live up to their higher cost price.
Since then, we have also been using the same components for subsequent prototypes building and testing. Not a single component has broken down throughout the many rounds of soldering/unsoldering, and not-so-gentle handling. This successfully eliminates our biggest worry of this campaign.
 
Supply & Manufacturing
We have set our delivery timelines by taking into account the time required for all manufactured components to reach our workshop for assembly, and then added some additional buffer period.
To further strengthen relationships, our team will visit the various manufacturing plants in May 2016 to ensure total accuracy of product manufacturing specifications, as well as lead time.
Every components will be ordered with 10% excess stock, to minimize reaction time should any component happen to be faulty-on-arrival. Ready back-up sources for every key component have also been negotiated for, and are ready to be activated with minimal delay.
 
Shipment
All shipments traditionally face an unlikely risk of delay or even missing/lost shipment, regardless of postal companies. In such an event, kindly contact us and we will work out a solution, or replacement for you.
We are also working with an established private freight-forwarding company in Singapore, to bring down the shipping cost significantly for international shipping with tracking option.
However, if you prefer FedEx postal services, simply drop us an e-mail and we can arrange it separately for you (extra charges applies).

 
 



 1. What games are support for Hubble controller ?Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous, EVE Online, and any other games which allow players to bind joystick keys, will work on with Hubble.

2. What are the PC requirements for Hubble ?Windows 7/8/10 PC. You will also need WIFI for the iPad Mini to connect to host PC on the same network.


3. Where can I find 3rd-party apps for my iPad Mini ?We recommend using ROCCAT™ Power-Grid™ software for the control interface. ROCCAT has invested much effort into their eco-system, and has an GRID store full of control interface for the latest games. You can even create your own control interface and share it here.


4. Why only iPad Mini ? Is Android supported ?The reason why we made the difficult decision to support only iPad Mini (with Lightning Charging Port) at launch, is mainly because it has retained almost identical form factor throughout its product refresh cycles.


iPad Mini's strong international availability, stable performance, strategic port placements and compact size enables us to design Hubble to work in tandem in the most seamless manner.
At the moment, we are experimenting with several ways that we can support Android tablets, but have no ETA on that at the moment.
5. Can I mount Hubble onto my desktop or cockpit ?Yes. Hubble's back-plate is pre-drilled with VESA compatible, 75mm and 100mm thru-holes.
6. What are the dimensions for Hubble ?Approximately: L 486mm x W 262mm x H 95mm
7. Does Hubble come with warranty ?It is in our standard operating procedure to personally test each button and function of every Hubble unit we ship so that the chances of backers receiving a faulty unit will be minimized
On top of that, we will cover every Hubble module for 12 months (18 months if Stretch Goal is achieved) against manufacturing defects. RMA procedures will be included in the final product.
8. Where can I buy cheap iPad Mini for Hubble ?If you are purchasing an iPad Mini only for gaming with Hubble, we recommend purchasing a pre-owned iPad Mini 2/3/4 via eBay, or refurbished via Apple's online store for your country.

The state falls into chaos. The army splits and part of it joins the rebels. Both the Usurper's and the Regent's forces gather near the capitol, ready to resolve the conflict in the only way possible. After a long battle the Usurper achieves victory and manages to capture his opponent. Now the Grand Vizier awaits his execution someplace in the Upper Palace. In the meantime, the young prince forces the Sultan's only daughter to marry him, so he can claim the Kingdom's throne. You, as the Vizier's favourite and most trusted apprentice are thrown into the dungeons deep down beneath the castle to await your grim and ominous future. Here, in the Sultan's Dungeons, your adventure starts. You must escape from prison, free the Grand Vizier and stop the evil prince in his ruthless quest for power!</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481634012/hcwcm7twir1e5viqyhgg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>Places</h3><p>On your way to fulfil your quest you will visit many parts of the castle.</p><h3>Deep Dungeons</h3><p>Under the castle there is a long maze of dark corridors and dusty halls, where rarely anybody dares to enter. Layers upon layers of these dungeons runs beneath the palace and the city, and none of the living can tell what creatures may slumber in the darkness beyond the bleak, flickering lights of the torches. These abandoned, desolate places often serve as a prison for the greatest and most dangerous enemies of the state – and that's where you start your adventure.</p><h3>The Armory</h3><p>These tunnels may lead you to many places – and the Armory is one of them. It is a military centre of the Kingdom, filled with soldiers, weapons and food supplies up to the brim. Here resides the Head of the Palace Guard – the strongest, the most skilled and the fattest guard you'll ever have a chance to fight against. He won't just let you pass by – you will have to earn your way to the Upper Palace.</p><h3>The Upper Palace</h3><p>Upper Palace is nothing like the dungeons you have seen before. Bathed in the sunlight it is luminous and bright, colorful and spectacular. Forget about the darkness you have been through. But its presence is often deceiving: you are not safe here! Your most dangerous enemies gather here, and they already know about your escape. They will not stand still, but actively try to bring you down. Brace yourself and fight against them!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481646570/i7s1eexydsxberbbwu9q.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>A concept for The Armory building blocks</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h3>Enemies</h3><p>Enemies are the cornerstone of almost any game. Your enemies in The Grand Vizier are numerous and differ among themselves in almost every possible aspect. Here is the showcase of 3 main types of the enemies in the game.</p><h3>The Palace Guard</h3><p>The most common among them is the Palace Guard. He is well trained, skilled and well equipped. He carries a longsword and uses the Kingdom's Coat of Arms. He does not serve The Usurper – he just fullfils his duty, which is to protect peace and order within the Palace Walls. A formidable foe – better not show in front of him unprepared.</p><h3>The Heavy Centurion</h3><p>As the uprising starts a serious breach divides the army. Some of the legions decide to take a neutral stance and wait for the Sultan to come back. Others remain loyal to the Grand Vizier and battle the rebels under his command. But there are some, who take the Usurper's side – and among them the most hardened and fearsome 3rd legion. After the war is over and the Prince achieve victory over the Vizier's forces, many soldiers from this legion are given the priviledge of nobility and are transferred straight to the Upper Palace to serve as the new ruler's personal guard. Now they roam the whole castle and make sure no one has even a slightest urge to oppose their leader. They are heavy armoured, carry a large shield and fight with a lance. They strike deadly, but because of all the metal they wear, they're very slow and you can use it to your advantage.</p><h3>The Living Skeleton</h3><p>Who knows what horrors may dwell in the abandoned, lowest parts of the Sultan's Dungeons? There are stories whispered throughout the Kingdom, stories that speak about horrid monsters born out of heinous, blaphemous deeds commited by the mages of the past. Are these true? There are some, who claim they've seen there a human skeleton moving by itself, but surely they must've been mistaken. Everybody knows that no such thing has ever existed, and human eyes are easy to deceive in the dim light of the burning torches...</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481633909/gowmr6ihpxem9mbhyzdt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>​</p><h3> </h3><h3>Bosses</h3><p>If enemies are the cornerstone of almost any game these days, then the bosses would be the icing on the cake. And The Grand Vizier features at least 4 of them with the Head of The Palace Guard (see above: The Armory) and the Evil Prince himself among them. They are tough. They are fast. They posses special abilities that will make you bent over backwards in order to defeat them. Don't worry though – the moment you get to them you'll realise you are much better prepared for them than you thought you are. But this is something you must discover yourself.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h3>But how do I fight them?</h3><p>With a sword. Or an axe. Or a dagger. Or a mace. On your way up you'll find many weapons you can use against your opponents. Each weapon has its own strengths and drawbacks. Some have a greater range, while other are meant for a really close combat. Some are faster, but do less damage, while others allow you to perform powerfull strikes at a higher cost of stamina. Yes, that's right – stamina. You didn't expect to wave your weapon indefinitely, did you? Stamina is the key element of the combat. You need to carefully time your moves so you won't run out of steam and get caught off guard. You also need to read your opponent movements to strike precisely at the moment he's defenseless due to the fatigue.</p><p>When your opponent slows down his attacks and takes more defensive stand it may mean he used up all of his stamina and cannot perform anything but the most basic combat moves. It is a perfect moment to strike – unless he's deceiving you. You must decide quickly whether to unleash all of your martial potential on him and risk being blocked and then becoming defenseless or wait for a next opportunity. Remember not to wait for too long though – at their full potential your enemies are nearly unstoppable and you may find yourself facing a certain death.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481646683/yxlv2otp0pvydud1ixt6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h3>Stealth</h3><p>Some people like to hit things with a metal stick until it's dead while other prefer more sophisticated approach. If you are one of them, then you are lucky – Sultan's Dungeons offer as much fun for those who like to fight face to face as for the others, who are more likely to backstab, strangle or break the necks of their enemies. Here, in this eldritch maze of tunnels you are almost always going to find a way to sneak past and hit from behind. You can also lure your enemies out of their safe spots or make them falling into a trap that was meant for you. Fight dirty, if you must – the fate of the Kingdom is at stake!</p><p> </p><h3>Magic</h3><p>Old tales speak of sorcerers of incomprehensible power who ruled the land along kings and sultans thanks to their magical prowess. It is said they could raise entire armies out of the sand and conjure stars to fall from the sky. They were feared by many and revered by some. Those times are long gone though and now most of the ancient knowledge is lost and forgotten. Yet, your Master, thanks to his life long studies of the dusty manuscripts, managed to uncover some secrets of old, and taught you few tricks that may come in handy while fighting your enemies. In your darkest hour fire is your greatest ally – you command it, you can mold it, you can empower it and turn it against your enemies should they be foolish enough to come close to its source.</p><p> </p><h3>Outfits and weapons</h3><p>Seriously, you can't expect your character to be running around in pyjamas for the entire game and fight his enemies with an old, rusty sword he has found in furthest and most forgotten part of the dungeon. Extreme conditions sometimes demand extreme responses, but your task is far too important to risk using such an inadequate equipment. Certainly on your way up to the palace you will find a lot of useful, high-quality gear that will make your task easier and accelerate your way to the top.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481633940/jquwrlssqcbm7wsahy4p.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>A concept for the various potions</i></p><h3> </h3><h3>Alchemy and potions</h3><p>Potions of all taste and colour – red, green, blue, teal, crimson, indigo and many more. Some of them will heal you. Others – they drug you. Some don't work at all. Others work almost too well. Some make you fly. Some make you faster, others render you immobile. Some turn you into an invincible demigod, while others multiply enemies in your eyes. You will never know until you try. Fortunately, you had an excellent alchemy teacher. You're not clueless. Smell the scent coming from the bottle, watch the liquid flowing back and forth, put two and two together and decide whether it's worth to try this one out. You may just hit the jackpot!</p><p> </p><h3>Collectibles</h3><p>For the eyes that know where to look, the dungeons are filled with forgotten treasures, gold and gemstones, silver and valueable ancient scriptures and artifacts. Most of those, who venture down to the deepest parts of the dungeon, pass these treasures by, never knowing the fortune they've missed. But those valueable items are there – just waiting to be taken from the darkness into the broad light of the day.</p><p> </p><h3>IT'S A TRAP!</h3><p>Dungeon without traps is like a dragon without teeth – just meh... Sultan's Dungeons are not like that. Within those dark corridors danger follows you like a shadow. On your way up to the Upper Palace you will face many perils and come across multitude of fatal spots. Spikes suddenly sticking out from the floor, treacherous holes in the floor, deadly choppers and grinders, poisonous arrows and flame throwers and who knows what else...? Truly, those locked up in the lower dungeons have very little chance to make it out of there alive.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">.....</h2><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481651619/gp26wdgpk1hgwmj92m0e.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></i></h2><p> </p><h3>Engaging 12 levels of the main campaing</h3><p>The Grand Vizier features a single player story consisting of 12 chapters with at least 1 game level per chapter. Each of the levels of the main campaign present slightly different type of challenge, whether it be traps, enemies, tough level boss or a large maze of tunnels – or combination of those, or something entirely different. Each of the levels plays slightly different, although solutions and skills aquired in the past will help player in the further journey. As player's expertise grows so rises the difficulty and complexity of the challenges. This way the game is always interesting and never gets too easy or too hard.</p><p> </p><h3>Level editor and your own scenarios and campaigns</h3><p>To me personally well done and easy to work with level editor is a brilliant addition to the game. Throughout the years I've seen many games being kept alive thanks to the dedication of their fans, who, while making new content for the game, often surpass original creators in ingenuity and cleverness of their levels design. On the other hand, I witnessed many great titles falling into oblivion just because their fans had no tools to exercise their creativity within the game. Therefore, the level editor and campaign editor are the core features of The Grand Vizier.</p><p> </p><h3>Multiplayer modes: race and cooperation and more</h3><p>The Grand Vizier features 2 multiplayer modes: Race and Cooperation. In the Race Mode players race each other. They start the level in different spots, but have to reach the same objective. Along their way they going to fight in the direct combat, set traps, destroy passages, lure enemies agains each other and try to read each other moves through the changes in environment. The first to complete the objective becomes the winner. The cooperation mode requires players to work together in order to complete puzzles and combat enemies. Each of the players posses different abilities, and none can succed without the help of others. It is possible The Grand Vizier will feature more than those two – but those 2 are guaranteed.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481646976/strk16kadungpuxpzlhj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>6 additional single player scenarios and more</h3><p>Have you ever felt that after completing the main campaign, after attaining the mastery of the sword and sorcery, you can't find anyting to do with your exceptional combat prowess? The Grand Vizier provides a solution. The game features six additional levels to test your skills after completing the main campaign. Tougher enemies, deadly traps and punishing bosses await those who dare to descent into the very bottom of the Sultan's dungeons.</p><p> </p><h3>12 multiplayer scenarios</h3><p>The Grand Vizier features 12 scenarios designed specifically with the multiplayer modes in mind. Six of those scenarios form chapters of the multiplayer co-op ladder (see above: Multiplayer modes), and the other six are prepared for the Race Mode.</p><p> </p><h3>Speedrun mode</h3><p>I love watching speedruns. People who can make an hours-long games into a 5 minute escapades never cease to amaze me. Therefore, for the convenience of those who wants to speedrun the game after playing it casually, The Grand Vizier features a special Speedrun Mode. In this mode all of the cutscenes and dialogue is skipped by default and there's a timer in the upper left corner of the screen. I am also open for suggestions for this mode, as I am sure hardened speedrunners can come up with many other ideas that will make recording speedruns easier.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481634408/agjkosmxuz4tovtpxdlq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h3>Random Potion Challenge mode</h3><p>Random Potion Challenge Mode is an another mode in the game in addition to the Standard Single- and Multiplayer modes. In the Random Potion Challenge Mode you can play any level or campaign you like – but all the potions have random, unpredictable effects that may help you, slow you down – or even kill you. And some of those potions are products of truly insane minds. They make you crush dungeon walls, walk on the ceiling, shoot lasers from your eyes and turn you into the mosquito.</p><p>This mode is not supposed to be serious. The palette of potential effects of the potions is very broad and they are meant to shock and surprise you. They are meant to turn the game upside down and inside out and make you think in the most unpredictable, unexpected ways. It is an addition to the 'normal' part of the game – if you will ever need a break from a regular dungeon delving, this mode is waiting for you.</p><p>But there's more! I count on your help. With the GRAND VIZIER reward package (learn more about the reward packages in the REWARDS section below) you can submit your idea for the insane, game-twisting potion for this mode. I hope that with the help of many people submitting their ideas this mode will be as interesting as possible.</p><p> </p><h3>Hidden levels</h3><p>Back in the '90 one of the best part of playing videogames was searching for – and sometimes finding – game's secrets, hidden levels, characters and cheat codes. Barely anyone had an internet access and it was taking an actual effort to either find secrets yourself or find any information about them. Now it is much easier – you can just type the right phrase into your favourite search engine and – voila! - you can know all the game's secrets in less than one minute. Still, for those, who are willing to discipline themselves to not to look up everything on the web in the very beginning, I want to include hidden levels into the game. They are not obligatory – in fact you can complete the game without entering single one of them.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">......</h2><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481651470/vyrwjaibsfjojqgzxujl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></i></h2><p>I started working on the game in April 2016. It took me around four weeks to finish the design on paper and in the beginning of May I was able to start materializing my ideas. Since then, thanks to the 6 months of work, The Grand Vizier has reached the pre-alpha state of the build and I can show you the actual footage from the game.</p><p>The footage you have seen in the video comes from the pre-alpha build of the game. The game is fully playable as of now, even though many of its features remain to be included. Thanks to the smart level creator, making new game levels and expanding existing ones is very easy and takes almost no time. The same goes for adding new assets to the game. There are already 4 levels made for the demonstration purposes. Almost all of the main character controls and movements are already in place and coded (more than 40 animations in total). I do hope to improve the set of animations though (as well as to improve the main hero model). Basic in-game devices like spikes and gates are already done and coded, and few others are halfway done. A very versatile and easy-to-controll camera is already in place. Plenty of other small elements of the game – scripts, models, prefabs – are in place.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">.......</h2><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481651870/htp6k7n4ifvozmjbusso.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></i></h2><p>I am sure you can remember an old classic titled The Prince of Persia (the one from 1989). You may also remember another classic called The Lost Vikings. To me, those two titles were the best games of the early '90. If you cannot recall them or if you haven't played those games at all, I recommend you to do it as soon as possible. In my humble opinion those two are the true gemstones of gaming and you will miss a fantastic experience, if you let those two titles pass you by. Despite the years that have passed since their initial release, they didn't lose any of their charm.</p><p>Those two titles were the main inspiration behind The Grand Vizier. Both inspire me in two ways: as a professional I see very well executed games with clever, genuine and well designed mechanics and as a gamer I remember all the fun and challenge they gave me. I hope The Grand Vizier can live up to its spiritual ancestors and – like them – give players a lot of fun and challenge while having an easy to learn, yet complex and interesting mechanics.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">........</h2><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481652000/kndglm5auly2rstn9qhu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></i></h2><p>Here's the complete list of all perks with all the details you need to decide which one is the best for you.

....In a sultan's absence, a young prince starts an uprising against the rightful regent, The Grand Vizier. The state falls into chaos. The army splits and part of it joins the rebels. Both the Usurper's and the Regent's forces gather near the capitol, ready to resolve the conflict in the only way possible. After a long battle the Usurper achieves victory and manages to capture his opponent. Now the Grand Vizier awaits his execution someplace in the Upper Palace. In the meantime, the young prince forces the Sultan's only daughter to marry him, so he can claim the Kingdom's throne. You, as the Vizier's favourite and most trusted apprentice are thrown into the dungeons deep down beneath the castle to await your grim and ominous future. Here, in the Sultan's Dungeons, your adventure starts. You must escape from prison, free the Grand Vizier and stop the evil prince in his ruthless quest for power!  PlacesOn your way to fulfil your quest you will visit many parts of the castle.Deep DungeonsUnder the castle there is a long maze of dark corridors and dusty halls, where rarely anybody dares to enter. Layers upon layers of these dungeons runs beneath the palace and the city, and none of the living can tell what creatures may slumber in the darkness beyond the bleak, flickering lights of the torches. These abandoned, desolate places often serve as a prison for the greatest and most dangerous enemies of the state – and that's where you start your adventure.The ArmoryThese tunnels may lead you to many places – and the Armory is one of them. It is a military centre of the Kingdom, filled with soldiers, weapons and food supplies up to the brim. Here resides the Head of the Palace Guard – the strongest, the most skilled and the fattest guard you'll ever have a chance to fight against. He won't just let you pass by – you will have to earn your way to the Upper Palace.The Upper PalaceUpper Palace is nothing like the dungeons you have seen before. Bathed in the sunlight it is luminous and bright, colorful and spectacular. Forget about the darkness you have been through. But its presence is often deceiving: you are not safe here! Your most dangerous enemies gather here, and they already know about your escape. They will not stand still, but actively try to bring you down. Brace yourself and fight against them! A concept for The Armory building blocks EnemiesEnemies are the cornerstone of almost any game. Your enemies in The Grand Vizier are numerous and differ among themselves in almost every possible aspect. Here is the showcase of 3 main types of the enemies in the game.The Palace GuardThe most common among them is the Palace Guard. He is well trained, skilled and well equipped. He carries a longsword and uses the Kingdom's Coat of Arms. He does not serve The Usurper – he just fullfils his duty, which is to protect peace and order within the Palace Walls. A formidable foe – better not show in front of him unprepared.The Heavy CenturionAs the uprising starts a serious breach divides the army. Some of the legions decide to take a neutral stance and wait for the Sultan to come back. Others remain loyal to the Grand Vizier and battle the rebels under his command. But there are some, who take the Usurper's side – and among them the most hardened and fearsome 3rd legion. After the war is over and the Prince achieve victory over the Vizier's forces, many soldiers from this legion are given the priviledge of nobility and are transferred straight to the Upper Palace to serve as the new ruler's personal guard. Now they roam the whole castle and make sure no one has even a slightest urge to oppose their leader. They are heavy armoured, carry a large shield and fight with a lance. They strike deadly, but because of all the metal they wear, they're very slow and you can use it to your advantage.The Living SkeletonWho knows what horrors may dwell in the abandoned, lowest parts of the Sultan's Dungeons? There are stories whispered throughout the Kingdom, stories that speak about horrid monsters born out of heinous, blaphemous deeds commited by the mages of the past. Are these true? There are some, who claim they've seen there a human skeleton moving by itself, but surely they must've been mistaken. Everybody knows that no such thing has ever existed, and human eyes are easy to deceive in the dim light of the burning torches... ​ BossesIf enemies are the cornerstone of almost any game these days, then the bosses would be the icing on the cake. And The Grand Vizier features at least 4 of them with the Head of The Palace Guard (see above: The Armory) and the Evil Prince himself among them. They are tough. They are fast. They posses special abilities that will make you bent over backwards in order to defeat them. Don't worry though – the moment you get to them you'll realise you are much better prepared for them than you thought you are. But this is something you must discover yourself. But how do I fight them?With a sword. Or an axe. Or a dagger. Or a mace. On your way up you'll find many weapons you can use against your opponents. Each weapon has its own strengths and drawbacks. Some have a greater range, while other are meant for a really close combat. Some are faster, but do less damage, while others allow you to perform powerfull strikes at a higher cost of stamina. Yes, that's right – stamina. You didn't expect to wave your weapon indefinitely, did you? Stamina is the key element of the combat. You need to carefully time your moves so you won't run out of steam and get caught off guard. You also need to read your opponent movements to strike precisely at the moment he's defenseless due to the fatigue.When your opponent slows down his attacks and takes more defensive stand it may mean he used up all of his stamina and cannot perform anything but the most basic combat moves. It is a perfect moment to strike – unless he's deceiving you. You must decide quickly whether to unleash all of your martial potential on him and risk being blocked and then becoming defenseless or wait for a next opportunity. Remember not to wait for too long though – at their full potential your enemies are nearly unstoppable and you may find yourself facing a certain death.  StealthSome people like to hit things with a metal stick until it's dead while other prefer more sophisticated approach. If you are one of them, then you are lucky – Sultan's Dungeons offer as much fun for those who like to fight face to face as for the others, who are more likely to backstab, strangle or break the necks of their enemies. Here, in this eldritch maze of tunnels you are almost always going to find a way to sneak past and hit from behind. You can also lure your enemies out of their safe spots or make them falling into a trap that was meant for you. Fight dirty, if you must – the fate of the Kingdom is at stake! MagicOld tales speak of sorcerers of incomprehensible power who ruled the land along kings and sultans thanks to their magical prowess. It is said they could raise entire armies out of the sand and conjure stars to fall from the sky. They were feared by many and revered by some. Those times are long gone though and now most of the ancient knowledge is lost and forgotten. Yet, your Master, thanks to his life long studies of the dusty manuscripts, managed to uncover some secrets of old, and taught you few tricks that may come in handy while fighting your enemies. In your darkest hour fire is your greatest ally – you command it, you can mold it, you can empower it and turn it against your enemies should they be foolish enough to come close to its source. Outfits and weaponsSeriously, you can't expect your character to be running around in pyjamas for the entire game and fight his enemies with an old, rusty sword he has found in furthest and most forgotten part of the dungeon. Extreme conditions sometimes demand extreme responses, but your task is far too important to risk using such an inadequate equipment. Certainly on your way up to the palace you will find a lot of useful, high-quality gear that will make your task easier and accelerate your way to the top. A concept for the various potions Alchemy and potionsPotions of all taste and colour – red, green, blue, teal, crimson, indigo and many more. Some of them will heal you. Others – they drug you. Some don't work at all. Others work almost too well. Some make you fly. Some make you faster, others render you immobile. Some turn you into an invincible demigod, while others multiply enemies in your eyes. You will never know until you try. Fortunately, you had an excellent alchemy teacher. You're not clueless. Smell the scent coming from the bottle, watch the liquid flowing back and forth, put two and two together and decide whether it's worth to try this one out. You may just hit the jackpot! CollectiblesFor the eyes that know where to look, the dungeons are filled with forgotten treasures, gold and gemstones, silver and valueable ancient scriptures and artifacts. Most of those, who venture down to the deepest parts of the dungeon, pass these treasures by, never knowing the fortune they've missed. But those valueable items are there – just waiting to be taken from the darkness into the broad light of the day. IT'S A TRAP!Dungeon without traps is like a dragon without teeth – just meh... Sultan's Dungeons are not like that. Within those dark corridors danger follows you like a shadow. On your way up to the Upper Palace you will face many perils and come across multitude of fatal spots. Spikes suddenly sticking out from the floor, treacherous holes in the floor, deadly choppers and grinders, poisonous arrows and flame throwers and who knows what else...? Truly, those locked up in the lower dungeons have very little chance to make it out of there alive...... Engaging 12 levels of the main campaingThe Grand Vizier features a single player story consisting of 12 chapters with at least 1 game level per chapter. Each of the levels of the main campaign present slightly different type of challenge, whether it be traps, enemies, tough level boss or a large maze of tunnels – or combination of those, or something entirely different. Each of the levels plays slightly different, although solutions and skills aquired in the past will help player in the further journey. As player's expertise grows so rises the difficulty and complexity of the challenges. This way the game is always interesting and never gets too easy or too hard. Level editor and your own scenarios and campaignsTo me personally well done and easy to work with level editor is a brilliant addition to the game. Throughout the years I've seen many games being kept alive thanks to the dedication of their fans, who, while making new content for the game, often surpass original creators in ingenuity and cleverness of their levels design. On the other hand, I witnessed many great titles falling into oblivion just because their fans had no tools to exercise their creativity within the game. Therefore, the level editor and campaign editor are the core features of The Grand Vizier. Multiplayer modes: race and cooperation and moreThe Grand Vizier features 2 multiplayer modes: Race and Cooperation. In the Race Mode players race each other. They start the level in different spots, but have to reach the same objective. Along their way they going to fight in the direct combat, set traps, destroy passages, lure enemies agains each other and try to read each other moves through the changes in environment. The first to complete the objective becomes the winner. The cooperation mode requires players to work together in order to complete puzzles and combat enemies. Each of the players posses different abilities, and none can succed without the help of others. It is possible The Grand Vizier will feature more than those two – but those 2 are guaranteed.  6 additional single player scenarios and moreHave you ever felt that after completing the main campaign, after attaining the mastery of the sword and sorcery, you can't find anyting to do with your exceptional combat prowess? The Grand Vizier provides a solution. The game features six additional levels to test your skills after completing the main campaign. Tougher enemies, deadly traps and punishing bosses await those who dare to descent into the very bottom of the Sultan's dungeons. 12 multiplayer scenariosThe Grand Vizier features 12 scenarios designed specifically with the multiplayer modes in mind. Six of those scenarios form chapters of the multiplayer co-op ladder (see above: Multiplayer modes), and the other six are prepared for the Race Mode. Speedrun modeI love watching speedruns. People who can make an hours-long games into a 5 minute escapades never cease to amaze me. Therefore, for the convenience of those who wants to speedrun the game after playing it casually, The Grand Vizier features a special Speedrun Mode. In this mode all of the cutscenes and dialogue is skipped by default and there's a timer in the upper left corner of the screen. I am also open for suggestions for this mode, as I am sure hardened speedrunners can come up with many other ideas that will make recording speedruns easier.  Random Potion Challenge modeRandom Potion Challenge Mode is an another mode in the game in addition to the Standard Single- and Multiplayer modes. In the Random Potion Challenge Mode you can play any level or campaign you like – but all the potions have random, unpredictable effects that may help you, slow you down – or even kill you. And some of those potions are products of truly insane minds. They make you crush dungeon walls, walk on the ceiling, shoot lasers from your eyes and turn you into the mosquito.This mode is not supposed to be serious. The palette of potential effects of the potions is very broad and they are meant to shock and surprise you. They are meant to turn the game upside down and inside out and make you think in the most unpredictable, unexpected ways. It is an addition to the 'normal' part of the game – if you will ever need a break from a regular dungeon delving, this mode is waiting for you.But there's more! I count on your help. With the GRAND VIZIER reward package (learn more about the reward packages in the REWARDS section below) you can submit your idea for the insane, game-twisting potion for this mode. I hope that with the help of many people submitting their ideas this mode will be as interesting as possible. Hidden levelsBack in the '90 one of the best part of playing videogames was searching for – and sometimes finding – game's secrets, hidden levels, characters and cheat codes. Barely anyone had an internet access and it was taking an actual effort to either find secrets yourself or find any information about them. Now it is much easier – you can just type the right phrase into your favourite search engine and – voila! - you can know all the game's secrets in less than one minute. Still, for those, who are willing to discipline themselves to not to look up everything on the web in the very beginning, I want to include hidden levels into the game. They are not obligatory – in fact you can complete the game without entering single one of them.......I started working on the game in April 2016. It took me around four weeks to finish the design on paper and in the beginning of May I was able to start materializing my ideas. Since then, thanks to the 6 months of work, The Grand Vizier has reached the pre-alpha state of the build and I can show you the actual footage from the game.The footage you have seen in the video comes from the pre-alpha build of the game. The game is fully playable as of now, even though many of its features remain to be included. Thanks to the smart level creator, making new game levels and expanding existing ones is very easy and takes almost no time. The same goes for adding new assets to the game. There are already 4 levels made for the demonstration purposes. Almost all of the main character controls and movements are already in place and coded (more than 40 animations in total). I do hope to improve the set of animations though (as well as to improve the main hero model). Basic in-game devices like spikes and gates are already done and coded, and few others are halfway done. A very versatile and easy-to-controll camera is already in place. Plenty of other small elements of the game – scripts, models, prefabs – are in place........I am sure you can remember an old classic titled The Prince of Persia (the one from 1989). You may also remember another classic called The Lost Vikings. To me, those two titles were the best games of the early '90. If you cannot recall them or if you haven't played those games at all, I recommend you to do it as soon as possible. In my humble opinion those two are the true gemstones of gaming and you will miss a fantastic experience, if you let those two titles pass you by. Despite the years that have passed since their initial release, they didn't lose any of their charm.Those two titles were the main inspiration behind The Grand Vizier. Both inspire me in two ways: as a professional I see very well executed games with clever, genuine and well designed mechanics and as a gamer I remember all the fun and challenge they gave me. I hope The Grand Vizier can live up to its spiritual ancestors and – like them – give players a lot of fun and challenge while having an easy to learn, yet complex and interesting mechanics.........Here's the complete list of all perks with all the details you need to decide which one is the best for you.

 Your Name in the CreditsYour support is important. The Grand Vizier can only happen because you believe in it. Therefore, I would like to put your name (or your nickname, if that's what you wish) in the game credits. By all means you deserve to be recognized by other memers of the gaming community. Without your help The Grand Vizier won't happen, and no one will be able to play it.For those of you who decided to support the game by choosing PRINCE perk or higher there's a special V.I.P. Section of the credits. It is displayed in the very beginning of the credits and all names in that section have an appropriate Sultan's Badge of Honour next to them. BETAWith the PALACE GUARD perk you are invited to play beta version of the game once The Grand Vizier hits that stage. Remember, this is the only opportunity to get acces to the game before the final release! Message BoardWith the ELITE GUARD perk, shortly after getting access to the beta version of the game you will get access to the closed message board where you can discuss all kinds of game-related stuff with other backers and creators of the game. You can provide your feedback, ask for things to change and submit your ideas. On occasion I'm going to ask you to vote on certain aspects of the game – whether you want it to be one way or another. The Sultan's Badge of HonorSultan's Bronze, Silver and Golden Badges are digital badges awarded to those who support The Grand Vizier by choosing the PRINCE perk or higher. They are going to be displayed next to your name or nickname in the game credits, on the closed message board and basically wherever you want. They have your name engraved on them. They show your dedication to the idea of The Grand Vizier and your contribution to the game. Collectible MessagesAttach a short message to the one of the game's collectibles and let it being read by anyone who manages to find it! Each of the collectibles within the game will unlock a short message from the backers and the creators of the game. That may include your message too! Submit your message with the SORCERER reward package and tell the other players what you think!Messages do not show in the game automatically. You can find your message as well as messages from other backers and creators of the game in the Collectibles Menu. Within this menu you can find description and history of every collectible object you find (and view the object up close).On the last note, submitted messages are moderated and they are supposed to be rather short. I will announce the message length and the exact rules in due time. In order to make it to the game your message must pass moderation, but I promise moderation to be as lenient and forgiving as possible. Random Potion Challenge ModeUnleash your creativity and help me design the most insane, game-twisting potions you can think of! With the GRAND VIZIER reward package you are able to submit your idea for a crazy potion and I will make my best effort to implement it to the game. Tell me what does the potion do, how does it look like. Don't limit yourself, be as wild as you like! I hope for the players to experience a true madness while playing the Random Potion Challenge Mode. It is not suppose to be too serious – have a lot of fun thinking about the potion!",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

Learning a language can be a great challenge, it requires a lot of time and effort, but the reward is also huge. <br/>A new language can give you new perspectives, change the way you see things, change the way you communicate and maybe even change your personality a bit. <br/>On the way, there are always many obstacles to overcome and sometimes it is not easy to find motivation to continue. We all know that video games can be a great source of motivation, many of us were learning English from video games, while others started to learn Japanese to be able to understand games, animes or mangas. <br/>We hope for some of you English Monsters can become just that little source of extra motivation to start or to continue learning. That final little push or that bit of light when things are not looking so great. Don't give up, it’s worthy! </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492491954/lzftlxlamtwrkjuspwig.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Two Japanese high-school students are waking up on a mysterious Island after touching an old book they found somewhere in Tokyo.

Learning a language can be a great challenge, it requires a lot of time and effort, but the reward is also huge. A new language can give you new perspectives, change the way you see things, change the way you communicate and maybe even change your personality a bit. On the way, there are always many obstacles to overcome and sometimes it is not easy to find motivation to continue. We all know that video games can be a great source of motivation, many of us were learning English from video games, while others started to learn Japanese to be able to understand games, animes or mangas. We hope for some of you English Monsters can become just that little source of extra motivation to start or to continue learning. That final little push or that bit of light when things are not looking so great. Don't give up, it’s worthy! Two Japanese high-school students are waking up on a mysterious Island after touching an old book they found somewhere in Tokyo. It seems it was not just a mere coincidence that they found the book, more like the book found them. The Island is in danger, Evil has awoken and trying to take the Island. It will destroy the peace, rule the realm and enslave the inhabitants of the Island... Only heroes from the other side can prevent the end of the world.  The Protector of the Island, a mysterious cat has summoned the two teens from the human world to assist him in the fight against evil and save the Island!   Guide the rookie English hero! Set on a journey with a mysterious cat and learn English.  Learn the language of the Island [English] together with your companion, while exploring the secrets it holds.  Complete quests and learn English and Japanese phrases.Earn golds and crystals in the game and upgrade your equipment. Defeat the boss at the final stage, save the Island and turn foes into allies!Make your legend! The HeroThe Heroine Teache (The Mysterious Cat)  The Shopkeeper The Heroine (uniform)  Go on an adventure in a beautifully drawn anime world created by Japanese artist Genjyuuya! All the monsters are original, and exclusively designed for the game by Japanese artist Genjyuuya! So you can meet with them only in English Monsters!Mascots and other character goods are being sold at the biggest art events throughout Japan, even the Tokyo Game Show. The purpose of the game is to study English in a fun way, master the basics of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. English Monsters is recommended for both beginners and intermediate level learners. The game itself is a traditional Japanese RPG, including the story-telling, the turn-based battles, the characters and the upgrade system. You can play English Monsters, just like any JRPG!  Fight against the Monsters with intuitive touch controls, beat them and learn their language! Repeat up to 3000 phrases, listen and talk!While improving your listening abilities, you will deepen your understanding of the meaning and correct usage of words.◆ There are many short quests to enjoy every day while commuting to work or school◆ Brush up your listening skills together with several native speakers and their accents◆ Master the correct usage of words like [get] and [take], which are essential in everyday conversations◆ There are plenty of examples with illustrations◇ In collaboration with Ace Crown, an English-Japanese dictionary popular in middle schools, high schools and university entrance examination preparatory courses in JapanCheck it out, if you want to learn either English or Japanese!You can learn efficiently with the most frequent phrases extracted from big data analysis.◇ Play on the train or anytime when you have a few minutes breakMost of the Quests can be completed in just a few minutes, so you can easily finish them even if you have just a bit of time. Playing regularly -even just short sessions-  will drastically improve your English!◇ Recommended for TOEIC, TOEFL or any other English exam applicantsEffective practice tool for both listening and reading sections of TOEICExamples show a general increase from 600 points to 800 points in half a year!And you can practice Japanese as well! The iOS version is ready and available on the Japanese App Store, but we need additional funds to port the game to Android and make it available and enjoyable to the Western audience, either English or Japanese learners. The funds will be only used to cover the expenses of the porting process and development of some additional features.  $6000-programming and development (salary, dev. kit, etc.)$2000-UI/UX design (redesign the UI for Android (English) and improve UX) $1000-PR (Social media campaign) $1000-Indiegogo (cost)Arigatou!

Following a cosmic event mingled with human intervention, the nature of existence has been changed. Inspired by ancient cultural tales, KIGAEA aims to introduce Magic in a new way.   Development of KIGAEA Tactics began on January 2nd, 2017. However, the concept of this game began back in 1998, inspired by the original tactics titles of the 90s. As a gamer, my favorite genre has always been Tactical Turn-Based RPGs. However, I was always left with the desire to explore the beautifully rendered isometric maps in such games.It always felt that these popular titles fell short of their full potential, focusing solely and mostly on the combat aspects. I found myself desiring other activities within a single player, isometric realm, such as Exploration, Trading, Collecting, Politics, and more of the traditional non-combat aspects of RPGs.At this stage of my life, I have acquired the skills and experience to develop a game of my own. Honestly, if I could only develop a single game in my life, this would be it. THIS is the game I have wanted to play since I was 12 years old, and I would like to present to you the concept that is KIGAEA Tactics.I sincerely hope you enjoy the presentation, and hopefully you will join me on this adventure to pave the way to the next generation of Tactical Turn-Based RPGs!   Never-before-seen Combat Engine. Turn-Based Choices, Real Time Action!All units move during the Action Phase, however choices are made in traditional Turn-Based manner during the Intent Phase. When units meet on the field, an Interaction occurs, giving you full control of your response and a myriad of ways to achieve a tactical victory!   Spells travel on the field, at a rate of X tiles per second. Action phase consists of a fixed amount of seconds, meaning that it will be possible to block spells, deflect spells, or even magically alter them while they are traveling on the field!   Example Action PhaseNote: Speed in-game will be faster than conceptual mock ups The 4x genre meets Tactical Turn-Based RPG, at the Unit's PerspectiveUnlike most traditional 4x titles where your role is All-Seeing, in KIGAEA Tactics you will manage your squad of units and explore this realm at the Unit's perspective. In order to play the 4x management aspects, you will have to achieve the respective Role in Society (e.g. if you want to influence Politics or Laws, become a Judge or Bribe Diplomats). Seamless (Yes, seamless!) Exploration to Combat TransitionWitness the A.I. battle as you sit on a bar stool and sip on a drink. Seamless transition to battle means, a war could ensue around you and you can do your best not to get involved, or you can indiscriminately wipe both sides. The choice will be yours. Classes unlock exploration skills and crafting skills. It's not all about combat in KIGAEA Tactics. Exploration is a big key, and non-combat activities will range from fishing*, to “cook-offs”*. Many unique events planned! * - Note: Initial Early Access release may not include fishing or cooking, as these features are planned for the Early Access stage of development. However, they may be included as Stretch Goals, to be made in time for Early Access. Next Generation A.I. built from scratch in PythonDeep A.I. Logic that is not time-dependent. No weekly schedules here! Only a robust mind that constantly analyzes its environment, and makes choices based on factors presented in Jungian psychology and other branches of Scientific study.An A.I. system devised of four Archetypal elements, and seven dynamic levels of Consciousness that vary based on the A.I.'s unique experience as the game progresses. No two games will be the same. No two A.I. will be the same. Needs vary. Moods vary. Actions change.Ever played a true telepath that read an A.I.'s intentions? With this A.I. system, such skills will be a regular tool of not only combat, but also exploration! A Living World that is dynamic, and affected by all player and A.I. decisionsEach Country will have a City with a Court. Each Court will have a Judicial Process. Each City will have Laws defining the type of Judicial Process. Countries have dynamic borders. Tribes can become politically tied to Countries, or become their own Independent organizations.The whole realm of KIGAEA Tactics will be a dynamic, closed system, designed as a 4x world, played at the Unit's perspective. Squad Management true to its OriginsArithmetic based growth, just like the original titles. Progress and improvements will be constant, after nearly every battle or non-combat quest. New classes unlock layers of game mechanics, to be used both for combat, and also exploration! Equipment will be arithmetically scaled, whereas crafting and unique items may add exponential scaling in the form of %s. However, such items will be exquisite and rare. The craftsmen of such pieces will be unique characters, influential to the realm and able to either be recruited or defeated (Note: try finding someone nowadays to make you a sword as good as a true Masamune katana...I wish to reflect that in KIGAEA Tactics, as older titles such as Suikoden embodied with its upgrading system).New synergies (classes) will enhance the abilities of older classes, so that no skill ever becomes obsolete (e.g. a Mage may have Fireball, but the stronger Magus may have Enhanced Projectiles ability, which can make Fireball or any other projectile spell from any class, more powerful...note Mage and Magus are hypothetical classes for the purpose of example only). Disclaimer: KIGAEA Tactics will be released as an Early Access game capable of delivering a full experience, and dozens (or hundreds, depending on your style) of hours of entertainment.However, the full World Map will not be available at Early Access launch. The Early Access timeline is designed such that new locations, classes, and non-combat mechanics (like fishing and crafting) will be introduced. The exploratory zone will expand through the Early Access development, until the full world is available for the full version release.For Early Access, expect the city of Centropolis, the Fishermen Tribe in the country of Midrealm, and various combat locations to be available, including the related artwork and lore. For more information on the Development Timeline through Early Access release, see below.   Currently, the following aspects have been programmed from scratch for the custom engine.

i was always good at programming but needed to support my family so i made sure there was always food and a roof over there head, but now i thought i should work towards building my own business and that's where 1&a1/4 Games come from.
 
About 1&a1/4 Games
At 1&a1/4 Games we want to make games designed to play and be as fun and immersive as games from the N64/Dreamcast era of gaming as i feel all that fun got lost in online mutiplayer and season passes were games are noting more than an unfinished mess that people have to wait years for them to finish. 
1&a1/4 Games are looking at making FPS/ Third Person and RTS games that are fun to play with mates and alone, so you can have the excitement of fully finished games the day of release.
Plus all the games will be made with Modders in mind but also a controlled mod that wont be classed as cheating.

Twitch your fingers through five enemy factions and their bosses, upgrade your ship and try to survive through unpredictable space events.</p>
<p>Levels are generated by combining hand-crafted waves (consisting of single enemies, squadrons, waypoint enemies and their combinations), multiple bosses' variations and random events to provide unique, but satisfying experience every time you play.</p>
<p>The <strong>Game Loop</strong> consists of Levels. First level is composed of Pirate only waves with a Pirate boss at the end. When you defeat the Pirate Boss, you get to choose a perk from a random selection of perks which will fit your play style (better firing rate for a weapon type, score bonus, and so on) and then enter the Warp. <strong>Random events</strong> can occur while being in warp, either a Warp Malfunction, which will drop you in the middle of a Meteor Storm, single faction space (the idea is to implement a special Warp Dweller faction which can be only found in Warp, if the funding allows), or other similar hazards during the next Level.<br/><br/>Next Level is made of Pirates AND Rift Miners, and so on until the final Boss. When you defeat it, you loop through the game again. The Bosses remain the same (in a sense of words, another variation of the Boss will be spawned on second loop) for each level, but the enemies are tougher, faster, fire more often and new, harder waves are added. Also, all the enemy factions are present from the start of Game Loop number 2.</p>

<p><strong>Warp Malfunction</strong></p>
<p>I borrowed this idea from Galaga Deluxe, one of my favorite games from Amiga 500 back in the day. Between the levels, there's a small chance that your warp drive will malfunction and you may end up in null-space where you will be attacked by solo faction ships only, or get stuck in a  meteor storm that can yield extra points or end your run if you are destroyed in it. If i get enough funding, i'd really like to make a special Warp Dweller faction that would appear only during the Warp Malfunction.<br/><br/><strong>Asteroid Rain</strong>, <strong>Laser Barrage, Minefield</strong><br/><br/>Complete the level during some of these events for an additional score multiplier.</p>
<p>I'm planning more events and i'd be more than happy to hear your ideas on this one.</p>
<p><strong>Perks</strong></p>

<p><br/>Of course, the main question is how will your pledge be used, so here is a quick breakdown of the expenses involved:</p>
<p><strong>Backgrounds</strong> <strong>-</strong> You noticed that the trailer only has two backgrounds. To make the game more visually pleasing i need 20 backgrounds in 5 thematic colors (red, green, blue, purple, yellow), each costing 45-70 USD per piece, which comes to roughly 1.500 USD since, besides the regular artist hours involved for making them, some additional hours will be probably needed for fixes and adjustments.<br/><br/><strong>Additional gfx works</strong> <strong>-</strong> Additional graphics include finishing the <strong>Rokh Raiders </strong>sprites, background elements, bullets, special effects, explosions and works on the Galaxy Database. I approximate that 1.000 USD is needed for all of that. It might seem much, but bear in mind that's only 33 hours of more or less standard artist pay.</p>
<p><strong>Translations</strong> <strong>-</strong> They cost around 0.1 USD per word for translating the basic user interface and options, but a lot more if i plan on translating the Galaxy Database. But for the basic translation into French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese and Japanese, i approximate that around 100-200 USD will be needed since the game does not have many words.</p>
<p><strong>Fees and taxes</strong> <strong>-</strong> Steam Fee is 100 USD and Indiegogo takes 5%, and then there's income taxes too, which will come around to 10-20% for this amount.<br/><br/><strong>Music and SFX - </strong>Music licenses are very expensive to obtain, but i am in contact with several musicians that are willing to let me use their music for an IndieGoGo and revenue cut. Still, it will come to at least 10-20% of the funding. I have been a music producer for more than 15 years so the sound effects will be handled by myself.</p>

A gem that will remain a classic in times to come and always remain fun and challenging. Therе's hardly anything worse than to ruin a great game by tons of bugs.I want to be completely transparent, share everything with the backers and let everyone express their opinion on features and how we can make them better, together.",29.0,2,"1 Campaign

 The future of the movies are the games. We always knew this.
You can choose what you wanna see in that ""movie"". When you're watching a movie, it's so annoying when the characters are dumb, and they do stupid things. Here you can make the story. Involution gives you the possibility to choose what to say, what to do, where to go. You can even kill yourself, if you want to. But you can't really save the game. When you die, you wake up in the last place you slept and you realize that everything was a nightmare. You can save Sasha, or you can kill her. You can even try to hug a lion. Or... you can do smart things like hiding. This game is not just like a movie, it's a simulation of what would you do in those moments. If everything was real. With a lot of suspense, drama, jump scares etc.
And if your lazy, you can watch a gameplay...   


We need money for Steam and for few assets.
We had to pay every software from our pocket so we can't afford another 1000 dollars. You can get the game on steam choosing a Perk and donating.Donating now, you get the game cheaper than the regular price on Steam.

<p>Creating STELLAR has been the work of over a dozen artists, programmers, engineers... and the administrators who have helped us keep it all together. </p>
<p>Now entering the Final Stages of production, STELLAR requires the full-time commitment of a core development team. Our campaign will allow us to make a final push with  6 graphic artists, 4 programmers, 3 sound technicians and 2 writers to bring the full potential of the game to life. Up to 60% of funding raised will be divided among this team to repay their hard work to this point.  </p>
<p>The campaign, if fully successful, will also contribute to expanding ViroGames' infrastructure and technology, which will help us in the long-term development of STELLAR and future games.</p>
<p>Securing licensing, registering the several unique designs, logos and characters, and other legal protections for STELLAR will involve mounting legal and registration fees. Campaign funds will seek to cover these fees.</p>

</div><div> <p>STELLAR is the creation of a group of friends and co-workers who weren't originally  connected to the world of Video Game development. We are primarily artists, engineers, programers and writers working in our own, particular careers. But we are also creators... and players.  Players obsessed with making an experience that is instantly enjoyable, adaptable and that will continue to evolve in new and exciting ways as more and more creative influences are added to our project.</p> <ul> <li>STELLAR is driven primarily by two factors: A smooth and intuitive flight experience, and  some of the most visually stunning settings and in-game artwork ever seen in mobile platforms.</li> <li>Developed in association with Graffitiworld and R3GMA, two rising Art and Media companies with access to world-class artists and top designers, musicians and engineers.</li> </ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>For the past 10 months we have worked tirelessly in bringing STELLAR to life. Much remains in development - primarily the grunt work of modelling and design, as well as crafting and streamlining the Multiplayer experience with properly rendered graphics and Sound sync. </p>
<p>We are already in the last stages of development. We are pushing this Indiegogo campaign to polish the game and bring a AAA experience for all players. However, a gruelling testing-period awaits, to ensure a high-quality product.</p>
<p>Whether this campaign is successful or not, a form STELLAR will be released on early Q3 2015 on the App Store and Play Store. We are fully committed to this project. However, the time and investment required for the final push (as per our current development plan) means that our Full Vision for the game would have to wait. </p>

5 vs 5 Multiplayer for IOS & Android






Viro-Games is an Indie Video Game Development Studio Based in Mexico City.

Urban Artists, Programmers, Designers, Writers, Animators, Musicians and Sound Engineers have been brought together to create a unique creative team. 
In Association with GraffitiWorld (Art-Design) & R3GMA (Sound-Music)
Help us ACHIEVE OUR DREAM of making the most advanced Mobile Space Game to date. Support our campaign!



Developing STELLAR has been a work of love and learning for our team. Our time, brain-power (and money) has gone into creating the first building-block of what we hope to develop into a wide-reaching gaming experience, across multiple platforms, bringing innovative design and fun new experiences to the Space Shooter genre.


We are in the last stages of development 
Target: mid-September. 
4 Spaceship Manufacturers. 
Over 50 unique ship models. 
60+ weapons with variable attributes. 
Upgrade your Spaceships at the Hangar - Tune them up to your liking. 
5 VS 5 Multiplayer Battles. Create a Squadron and play with your friends. 
League System - Get ranked only with adversaries worth fighting. 
Leaderboards & Achievements.
5 Game-play modes TDM, CTF, FFA, DTB and RC*
Energy Weapons (Lasers - Plasma Cannons) & Classic Weapons (Machine Gun - Missiles) 
SPACE ROBOTS!!
3D Radar - Heat Seeking Weapons - Predictive Missiles. 
Immersive and Futuristic HUD System & UI.
10 fully-detailed arenas:  Planets, Galaxies, Star Systems, Local Stars, Nebulas, Cosmic particles, Stellar Dust.   

Alpha Rigel - Planet Teaser






Creating STELLAR has been the work of over a dozen artists, programmers, engineers... and the administrators who have helped us keep it all together. 
Now entering the Final Stages of production, STELLAR requires the full-time commitment of a core development team. Our campaign will allow us to make a final push with  6 graphic artists, 4 programmers, 3 sound technicians and 2 writers to bring the full potential of the game to life. Up to 60% of funding raised will be divided among this team to repay their hard work to this point.  
The campaign, if fully successful, will also contribute to expanding ViroGames' infrastructure and technology, which will help us in the long-term development of STELLAR and future games.
Securing licensing, registering the several unique designs, logos and characters, and other legal protections for STELLAR will involve mounting legal and registration fees. Campaign funds will seek to cover these fees.

The Impact
 STELLAR is the creation of a group of friends and co-workers who weren't originally  connected to the world of Video Game development. We are primarily artists, engineers, programers and writers working in our own, particular careers. But we are also creators... and players.  Players obsessed with making an experience that is instantly enjoyable, adaptable and that will continue to evolve in new and exciting ways as more and more creative influences are added to our project.  STELLAR is driven primarily by two factors: A smooth and intuitive flight experience, and  some of the most visually stunning settings and in-game artwork ever seen in mobile platforms. Developed in association with Graffitiworld and R3GMA, two rising Art and Media companies with access to world-class artists and top designers, musicians and engineers.

Risks & Challenges
For the past 10 months we have worked tirelessly in bringing STELLAR to life. Much remains in development - primarily the grunt work of modelling and design, as well as crafting and streamlining the Multiplayer experience with properly rendered graphics and Sound sync. 
We are already in the last stages of development. We are pushing this Indiegogo campaign to polish the game and bring a AAA experience for all players. However, a gruelling testing-period awaits, to ensure a high-quality product.
Whether this campaign is successful or not, a form STELLAR will be released on early Q3 2015 on the App Store and Play Store. We are fully committed to this project. However, the time and investment required for the final push (as per our current development plan) means that our Full Vision for the game would have to wait.

<p>Hi, IndieGoGo. In this short section I'd just like to say that the next lines talks about the basis of the calculation in detail, with mathematical operations (they are so easy don't worry ;) and the schedule.</p>
<p>The <b>video</b> conteins<b> what about </b>this proyect and <b>why</b> I want to do it. I <b>highly recommend</b> you that you <b>see it</b> because this kind of things feel more real and closer on image than through words.</p>
<p>I've planned like this because, in my opinion, if I were a backer, I'd like to know for sure where I'm investing my money so I have created a brief document but contains all you need to know economically, while the rest of things I put in the video since they are more entertaining.</p>

<p>Hola, IndieGoGO. En esta breve sección me gustaría comentar que todo lo que viene a continuación trata sobre el cálculo que he llevado a cabo detalladamente, con operaciones matemáticas (son muy fáciles, tranquilos ;) y el calendario.</p>
<p>El video contiene sobre <b>qué trata</b> el proyecto y <b>por qué</b> quiero hacerlo. Os <b>recomiendo</b> <b>enormemente</b> que <b>veáis</b> el video porque esta clase de temas se aprecian más cercanas y sinceras a través de la imagen que de las palabras.</p>
<p>Lo he planteado así porque, en mi opinión, si yo fuera promotor, me gustaría saber dónde invierto mi dinero así que he creado un breve documento pero que contiene todo lo que necesitas saber en términos económicos, mientras que el resto de las cosas las puse en el video ya que son más entretenidas.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>So, if you have taken a look to those numbers, you will ask yourself how I have got them. Stay with me a little bit more if you want to know it.</b></p>
<h3><b>ACTORS</b></h3>
<p>Based on the <a href=""http://adoma.es/convenio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">dubber agreement</a> (salary annexure is at the end) from Madrid, Spain, it forced me to work out the <b>number of half-hours</b> that the dubbers are going to work since the first <b>half hour or fragment</b> (this is the case  the recording session finish without completing the half hour) it costs 82.88 $, while the following half-hours or fragments cost 49.72 $.</p>
<p>That’s why I set an <b>average</b> of <b>7 minutes per sentence</b> (it's an approximate duration in which I take into account possible setbacks that might arise in the work such as the actor's skills or if their way to act weren't in line with the director’s view). This means that the amount of <b>money requested is bigger than it actually is</b>.</p>
<p>Considering that and following the <a href=""http://adoma.es/convenio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">dubber's agreement</a>, one working day is equal to 6 and a half hours (400 minutes) so I estimated how many sentences could be recorded approximately in that time:</p>
<p></p>
<p>                            <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1354277/files/20150404035344-6.png?1428144824"" src="""" style=""width: 395px; height: 107px;""/></p>
<p>Thus, I jumped to the next inference and I conclude that:<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>        <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">   </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1354287/files/20150404040155-7.png?1428145315"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Therefore, I can work out with all this data how many recording days I need for each character. Supposing Lee, the reckoning would be like this:<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p>                                     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1354288/files/20150404040348-8.png?1428145428"" src="""" style=""width: 352px; height: 142px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>In this way, I can <b>get how many days</b> I need for each character, which allows me to create an approximate planning.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have to work out <b>how much money I will spend</b>. With all the previous data, I can know how many half-hours there are in the number of working days of each character (let us remember that spanish dubbers are paid each half hour that they are recording). If we deduce that:</p>
<p></p>
<p>        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1354290/files/20150404040615-9.png?1428145575"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""> Still supposing Lee, our result is:<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>                                       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1354297/files/20150404040938-10.png?1428145778"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>Following the <a href=""http://adoma.es/convenio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">agreement guidelines</a>, since you call the actor in, is more expensive (82.88 $). Therefore, as the actor is going to be called 25 times as he has 25 recording days, it should be substracted 25 half-hours from the total (which is 325 half-hours) in order to obtain how much would cost the total call price:<br/><p></p>
<p>                                         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1354300/files/20150404041248-11.png?1428145968"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Once I got <b>how much money</b> I must pay him<b> for the call</b>, now I have to work out <b>how much money</b> he will receive <b>for the following half normal hours</b> (which cost 49.72 $). In this way, we start by the above-mentioned substraction:<br/></p>
<p>                                          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1354302/files/20150404041520-12.png?1428146120"" src="""" style=""width: 299px; height: 188px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p> Obviously, <b>this is insane and happens for two reasons</b>:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It would be significantly reduced if I knew for a fact how much time would be necessary to record each sentence.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Usually, dubbing companies have actors with an open-ended contract and they choose them as main characters in order to cut costs.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>That’s why <b>I have decided to reduce the main character’s salary</b> multiplying by 2 with the higher salary (which is 3397 $), obtaining 6443 $ approximately.</p>
<h1><br/></h1>
<h3>SOUND ENGINEER</h3>
<p>In relation to the sound engineer, I have worked out his salary through the <a href=""http://cice.es/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/convenio-colectio-tabla-salarial-produccion-audiovisual-2014.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">audiovisuals agreement of 2014</a> (I couldn’t find the agreement of this year and it appears at the end) from Spain. This post receives 322.17 $ per week. Supposing that a week, in this case, is equal to 7 days, I have to <b>ignore Saturdays and Sundays </b>since I will just <b>record on weekdays</b>. For that, first of all I have calculated <b>how much money</b> he actually receive <b>per day</b>:</p>
<p>                                                 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1354310/files/20150404042128-13.png?1428146488"" src="""" style=""width: 202px; height: 72px;""/></p>If this is the case, I have to substract Saturday and Sunday’s salary from which he receive in a week. Therefore:<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>                                   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1354316/files/20150404042710-14.png?1428146830"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Finally, based on the planning, 42 recording days are month and a half approximately.As we are not including weekends, it would last to 2 months (8 weeks). In this way, we obtain <b>the salary of the sound engineer</b>:</div>
<div>
<p>                                                        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1354317/files/20150404042906-15.png?1428146946"" src="""" style=""width: 205px; height: 79px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<h1>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">THE REST</span><br/>
</h1>
<p>In relation to the rest of things, the <b>casting costs</b> and <b>tester costs</b> are <b>indicative</b> (although the price of casting appears in the agreement dubber, which is 38.68 $), while the <b>rental recording studio</b>, according to my searching, is usually costs between 161 to 215 $ per day (if you multiply by the 42 days, the price is about 7517 $).</p>
<p>The <b>miscellaneous expenses</b> is equal to the fees charged.</p>
<p>The <b>director salary</b> is <b>void</b> since <b>I am the director</b> and my <b>sole purpose</b> with this proyect is <b>acquire professional maturity </b>and <b>bring myself a satisfactory experience</b>, in addition to use that as a possible Bacherol’s tesis for college. <b>Non-profit-making for me. </b></p>
<p>Obviously, all of this <b>numbers can vary a lot because if one lasted so much in dubbing a videogame, it would be crazy</b>. I have worked all out <b>based on higher numbers than they actually are</b> since, in contrary way, I could risk not make payments. In case of having money left over, I commit myself to create another proyect of a similar nature.</p>
<p>I hope I’m making myself crystal clear.</p>

<p>Teniendo en cuenta que, según el <a href=""http://adoma.es/convenio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">convenio de dobladores</a>, una jornada equivale a 6 horas y media (que son 400 minutos), calculé cuántas frases más o menos se podrían locutar en ese tiempo. Es decir: </p>

<p></p>
<h3>EL RESTO</h3>
<p>Respecto al resto de cosas, los <b>gastos de casting</b> y <b>testeadores</b> son <b>orientativos</b> (aunque el precio del casting, 36,02 €, aparece en el convenio de dobladores), mientras que el <b>alquiler de la sala</b>, según mis investigaciones, suelen rondar los 150 o 200 € por día (si se multiplica por los 42 días rondan los 7000€).</p>
<p>Los <b>gastos varios</b> equivalen a las tarifas que se cobran.</p>
<p>El precio del <b>director</b> es <b>nulo</b> ya que, <b>siendo yo el director, mi único objetivo</b> con este proyecto es <b>adquirir madurez profesional</b> y <b>llevarme una experiencia satisfactoria</b>, además de utilizarlo como posible estudio de Trabajo de Fin de Grado para la universidad, <b>sin ningún fin lucrativo para mi persona</b>.</p>
<p>Evidentemente, <b>todo esto puede variar mucho porque si se durara tanto en doblar un juego sería una locura</b>. Yo <b>he calculado a la alta</b> ya que, de modo contrario, podría arriesgarme a no cumplir con los pagos. En caso de que sobre dinero, me comprometo a crear otro proyecto de índole parecida.</p>
<p>Espero que les haya quedado todo muy claro.</p>

<h2>RISKS AND CHALLENGE / RIESGOS Y DESAFÍOS</h2>
<p><b><i>ENGLISH</i></b></p>
<p>The only clear risk that comes to my mind is (I need the appoval of the videogame company as the game is not mine, as you know, so I can  continue with the proyect and the only way to get his attention was through this web page, since I'm a nobody compared to them.</p>
<p>If I could reach the goal, I'll move heaven, earth and space to get the neccesary rights . I would do anything I could to carry out the proyect.</p>
<p>If I couldn't get them, I would resolve to do a proyect of a similar nature or to create an indie videogame that I have in mind with some people I know.</p>
<p><b><i>SPANISH</i></b></p>
<p>El único riesgo claro que me viene a la mente es que, como ya sabrán, este juego pertenece a una compañía, por lo que necesito su visto bueno para continuar con el proyecto pero la única manera que tenía de llamarles la atención era a través de esta plataforma, ya que yo solo era un don nadie.</p>
<p>Si consiguiera llegar a la meta, movería tierra, mar y cielo para conseguir los derechos necesarios. Haría lo que fuera por llevar adelante el proyecto.</p>
<p>En caso de no conseguirlo, me dispondría a hacer un proyecto de índole parecida o a crear un videojuego indie que tengo en mente con unos conocidos.</p>

Hi, IndieGoGo. In this short section I'd just like to say that the next lines talks about the basis of the calculation in detail, with mathematical operations (they are so easy don't worry ;) and the schedule.
The video conteins what about this proyect and why I want to do it. I highly recommend you that you see it because this kind of things feel more real and closer on image than through words.
I've planned like this because, in my opinion, if I were a backer, I'd like to know for sure where I'm investing my money so I have created a brief document but contains all you need to know economically, while the rest of things I put in the video since they are more entertaining.

Una introducción antes de empezar
Hola, IndieGoGO. En esta breve sección me gustaría comentar que todo lo que viene a continuación trata sobre el cálculo que he llevado a cabo detalladamente, con operaciones matemáticas (son muy fáciles, tranquilos ;) y el calendario.
El video contiene sobre qué trata el proyecto y por qué quiero hacerlo. Os recomiendo enormemente que veáis el video porque esta clase de temas se aprecian más cercanas y sinceras a través de la imagen que de las palabras.
Lo he planteado así porque, en mi opinión, si yo fuera promotor, me gustaría saber dónde invierto mi dinero así que he creado un breve documento pero que contiene todo lo que necesitas saber en términos económicos, mientras que el resto de las cosas las puse en el video ya que son más entretenidas.

ENGLISH



TIMETABLE 



CASTING ---> From beginning of June until July 17th (I have to search on Internet to find new talents, that's why it lasts so much).



RECORDING ---> From July 20th until mid-September.
POST-PRODUCTION AND TESTING ---> From mid-September until end of October.



GETTING TO THE POINT 


       
     TOTAL ACTORS = 34865$

SCHEDULE 




     TOTAL DAYS = 42 DAYS

FINAL BUDGET


      
        TOTAL = 54424,14$

BASES OF THE CALCULATION 

So, if you have taken a look to those numbers, you will ask yourself how I have got them. Stay with me a little bit more if you want to know it.
ACTORS
Based on the dubber agreement (salary annexure is at the end) from Madrid, Spain, it forced me to work out the number of half-hours that the dubbers are going to work since the first half hour or fragment (this is the case  the recording session finish without completing the half hour) it costs 82.88 $, while the following half-hours or fragments cost 49.72 $.
That’s why I set an average of 7 minutes per sentence (it's an approximate duration in which I take into account possible setbacks that might arise in the work such as the actor's skills or if their way to act weren't in line with the director’s view). This means that the amount of money requested is bigger than it actually is.
Considering that and following the dubber's agreement, one working day is equal to 6 and a half hours (400 minutes) so I estimated how many sentences could be recorded approximately in that time:

                            
Thus, I jumped to the next inference and I conclude that:

           
Therefore, I can work out with all this data how many recording days I need for each character. Supposing Lee, the reckoning would be like this:

                                     

In this way, I can get how many days I need for each character, which allows me to create an approximate planning.
On the other hand, I have to work out how much money I will spend. With all the previous data, I can know how many half-hours there are in the number of working days of each character (let us remember that spanish dubbers are paid each half hour that they are recording). If we deduce that:

        
 Still supposing Lee, our result is:

                                       

Following the agreement guidelines, since you call the actor in, is more expensive (82.88 $). Therefore, as the actor is going to be called 25 times as he has 25 recording days, it should be substracted 25 half-hours from the total (which is 325 half-hours) in order to obtain how much would cost the total call price:
                                         
Once I got how much money I must pay him for the call, now I have to work out how much money he will receive for the following half normal hours (which cost 49.72 $). In this way, we start by the above-mentioned substraction:
                                          

 Obviously, this is insane and happens for two reasons:




It would be significantly reduced if I knew for a fact how much time would be necessary to record each sentence.


Usually, dubbing companies have actors with an open-ended contract and they choose them as main characters in order to cut costs.




That’s why I have decided to reduce the main character’s salary multiplying by 2 with the higher salary (which is 3397 $), obtaining 6443 $ approximately.

SOUND ENGINEER
In relation to the sound engineer, I have worked out his salary through the audiovisuals agreement of 2014 (I couldn’t find the agreement of this year and it appears at the end) from Spain. This post receives 322.17 $ per week. Supposing that a week, in this case, is equal to 7 days, I have to ignore Saturdays and Sundays since I will just record on weekdays. For that, first of all I have calculated how much money he actually receive per day:
                                                 If this is the case, I have to substract Saturday and Sunday’s salary from which he receive in a week. Therefore:

                                   Finally, based on the planning, 42 recording days are month and a half approximately.As we are not including weekends, it would last to 2 months (8 weeks). In this way, we obtain the salary of the sound engineer:

                                                        


THE REST

In relation to the rest of things, the casting costs and tester costs are indicative (although the price of casting appears in the agreement dubber, which is 38.68 $), while the rental recording studio, according to my searching, is usually costs between 161 to 215 $ per day (if you multiply by the 42 days, the price is about 7517 $).
The miscellaneous expenses is equal to the fees charged.
The director salary is void since I am the director and my sole purpose with this proyect is acquire professional maturity and bring myself a satisfactory experience, in addition to use that as a possible Bacherol’s tesis for college. Non-profit-making for me. 
Obviously, all of this numbers can vary a lot because if one lasted so much in dubbing a videogame, it would be crazy. I have worked all out based on higher numbers than they actually are since, in contrary way, I could risk not make payments. In case of having money left over, I commit myself to create another proyect of a similar nature.
I hope I’m making myself crystal clear.

TOTAL ACTORES = 32468,86 €


PLANIFICACIÓN 





        TOTAL DÍAS = 42 DÍAS



PRESUPUESTO FINAL






TOTAL = 50683,26 €


BASES DEL CÁLCULO 



Si has echado un vistazo a esos números, te preguntarás de dónde me los he sacado. Pues quédate conmigo si lo quieres saber.
ACTORES
Basándome en el convenio de dobladores (el anexo salarial se encuentra al final) de Madrid, España, éste me obligaba a calcular el número de medias horas de los que dispongo para realizar el doblaje, ya que la primera media hora o fracción (es decir, si la sesión finaliza sin llegar a completar la media hora) equivale a 77,18 €, y las siguientes medias horas o fracciones equivalen a 46,30 €.
Por ello, establecí una media de 7 minutos por frase (una duración aproximada teniendo en cuenta posibles contratiempos que pudieran surgir tales como las habilidades del actor o que su forma de interpretar no fuera la requerida por el director), lo que significa que la cantidad de dinero solicitada es mayor de lo que en realidad es.
Teniendo en cuenta que, según el convenio de dobladores, una jornada equivale a 6 horas y media (que son 400 minutos), calculé cuántas frases más o menos se podrían locutar en ese tiempo. Es decir: 
                                          
 De esta forma, pasé a la siguiente deducción y concluí que:

                          
Por tanto, con esto puedo calcular cuántas jornadas de grabación necesito para cada personaje. En el caso de Lee, quedaría así:

                                                  

De esta manera, consigo averiguar cuántos días necesito para cada personaje lo que me permite crear una planificación aproximada.
Por otra parte, tengo que calcular cuánto dinero me voy a gastar. Con todo lo obtenido anteriormente, puedo saber cuántas medias horas hay en el número de jornadas de cada personaje (recordemos que a los actores de voz se les paga cada media hora que estén grabando). Si deducimos que:
                       
Siguiendo con el ejemplo de Lee, obtenemos que:

                                                
Siguiendo las pautas del convenio, la primera media hora se cobra más cara por convocar al actor. Por tanto, como el actor va a ser convocado 25 veces por tener 25 jornadas de grabación, a las 325 medias horas habría que restarle 25, para obtener cuanto sería la cuota de convocatoria, cuyo precio era 77,18 €:

                                         
Una vez sacado cuánto le tengo que pagar por convocatoria, ahora debo calcular cuánto le correspondería por las siguientes medias horas normales (que se pagan por 46,30 €). Así, comenzamos por la resta anteriormente mencionada:

                                          

 Evidentemente, esto es una burrada y ocurre por dos motivos:


Esto se reduciría notablemente si supiera a ciencia cierta cuánto se duraría en grabar cada frase.

Normalmente las empresas de doblaje tienen a actores con contrato indefinido y los eligen a ellos como protagonistas por lo que se abaratan los costes.

Por ello, he decidido rebajar el sueldo del protagonista multiplicándolo x2 con respecto al sueldo más alto (3163,9 €), saliendo aproximadamente 6000 €.


TÉCNICO DE SONIDO
Respecto al técnico de sonido, he obtenido su sueldo a través del convenio de audiovisuales de 2014 (ya que el de este año me ha sido imposible encontrarlo) de España. Este puesto tiene un sueldo de 300,02 € a la semana. Suponiendo que la semana, en este caso, equivale a 7 días, yo tengo que ignorar sábados y domingos ya que solo grabaré entre semana. Para ello, primeramente he calculado a cuánto toca cada día:

                                                             
Si esto es así, debo restar sábado y domingo a lo que gana a la semana. Por tanto:

                                            
Finalmente, basándonos en el planning, 42 días de grabación son 1 mes y medio aproximadamente, pero como no estamos utilizando los fines de semana, se nos quedaría en 2 meses (8 semanas). Así, obtenemos el sueldo del técnico de mesa:

                                                          

EL RESTO
Respecto al resto de cosas, los gastos de casting y testeadores son orientativos (aunque el precio del casting, 36,02 €, aparece en el convenio de dobladores), mientras que el alquiler de la sala, según mis investigaciones, suelen rondar los 150 o 200 € por día (si se multiplica por los 42 días rondan los 7000€).
Los gastos varios equivalen a las tarifas que se cobran.
El precio del director es nulo ya que, siendo yo el director, mi único objetivo con este proyecto es adquirir madurez profesional y llevarme una experiencia satisfactoria, además de utilizarlo como posible estudio de Trabajo de Fin de Grado para la universidad, sin ningún fin lucrativo para mi persona.
Evidentemente, todo esto puede variar mucho porque si se durara tanto en doblar un juego sería una locura. Yo he calculado a la alta ya que, de modo contrario, podría arriesgarme a no cumplir con los pagos. En caso de que sobre dinero, me comprometo a crear otro proyecto de índole parecida.
Espero que les haya quedado todo muy claro.


RISKS AND CHALLENGE / RIESGOS Y DESAFÍOS
ENGLISH
The only clear risk that comes to my mind is (I need the appoval of the videogame company as the game is not mine, as you know, so I can  continue with the proyect and the only way to get his attention was through this web page, since I'm a nobody compared to them.
If I could reach the goal, I'll move heaven, earth and space to get the neccesary rights . I would do anything I could to carry out the proyect.
If I couldn't get them, I would resolve to do a proyect of a similar nature or to create an indie videogame that I have in mind with some people I know.
SPANISH
El único riesgo claro que me viene a la mente es que, como ya sabrán, este juego pertenece a una compañía, por lo que necesito su visto bueno para continuar con el proyecto pero la única manera que tenía de llamarles la atención era a través de esta plataforma, ya que yo solo era un don nadie.
Si consiguiera llegar a la meta, movería tierra, mar y cielo para conseguir los derechos necesarios. Haría lo que fuera por llevar adelante el proyecto.
En caso de no conseguirlo, me dispondría a hacer un proyecto de índole parecida o a crear un videojuego indie que tengo en mente con unos conocidos.



WHO AM I? / ¿QUIÉN SOY?

ENGLISH
Hey, what's up? My name is Ángel Molina and I'm 20 years old. I love to do Motion Graphics, to dub and to edit sound and image too. I study Audiovisual Communication in Spain so cinema is one of my greatest passions and I'm always ready to learn more about photography, camera shooting and visual techniques.
For the moment, I haven't done any professional work yet but I hope this web page and his funders can give me a challenge.

<p>Initially the idea came up to me while I was studying for my Engineering semester exam. I started working on the same day and came up with an initial prototype that was too boring. There were many iterations of the game and after six months I have reached to the existing game. I then tested it's worthiness by passing it on to my friends and they seemed to like it and that is when I decided that the everyone should enjoy Xploding!</p>
<p>The process of designing the game was very hectic for me as i had to exams coming up alongside. The project has taken a lot of thinking and I am sure that each one of you will enjoy it a lot!</p>

</div><p><br/></p></div>","Xplode is a highly strategic and ultra Xplosive card game. If you like to Xplode a player or DUMP your enemy then this is the game for you. Players take turn picking a card from the deck until you get bombed. Trust me when I say that the bomb is more powerful than the Tsar Bomba.

The deck also contains cards that will help you bomb a player or your enemy in the game. You can even save your self from the bomb using the shield made using reinforced titanium metal.
The game is easy to play and child friendly. Don't get me wrong here. The game is easy to play but not easy to win. The game gets intensified as you proceed. Every time you draw a card you increase the chances of drawing the bomb or getting yourself Xploded by an opponent.
Please back the project so that you get to Xplode your friends and help this game reach every one.
Thank you - 
   Armaan + My brains



Rule #1 : Each player takes turn in drawing a card until he gets bombed.                                                                        
If you are bombed you get Xploded and you are out of the game.

Rule #2 : You can save yourself if you have the SHIELD.

                                                
The shield can stop any attack from reaching you including the special powers included in the Premium pack. (It's a secret, you get to know when you get the pack)
Rule #3 : The pack includes special cards such as the KICK and the DUMP card.

                                    
The KICK card allows you to Xplode the next player and with the DUMP card (My favorite)  you can Xplode any player in the game.      
Rule #4 : You get another card with which you can pass onto the next player                    (1 secret revealed)


The card is not so huge, but this is the card that you will most frequently see in the deck. For blue haters do not worry, you will get four different type of the NEXT cards and I pray that your color comes in that.
Rule #5 : You also get other powers such as SKIP and the REVERSE card.
Rule #6 : Enjoy the game!

<p>Two different forces that have opposed ideals! </p>
<p><i>Azariahans </i>cohabit in peace with all living beings and they believe <i>Ormonh</i> was created to be a place of harmony in the universe. Their duty is to protect it from all evil, especially the <i>Zuggul</i>.</p>

<p><strong><i>The Orikan Stone</i></strong> and <strong><i>Berehalem </i></strong>are somehow separated.</p>
<p><strong><i>The Orikan Stone</i></strong> is the first chapter of a big storyline that we will release. <strong><i>Berehalem</i></strong> is the main title of a large story written by Guilherme Silva and also the name of one of the most powerful divine creatures within the games' universe.</p>
<p><i><strong>The Orikan Stone</strong></i> takes place in the country known as <i>Sirhils</i>. This is where the player takes control of <i>Sahnu</i>, a 19 year old boy that was brought up under the name of an old swordsman, <i>Hyune</i>, since he was a child.</p>
<p>The story begins when a group of<i> Zuggul</i> attack <i>Hyune</i> and steal the amulet which contains the <i>Orikan Stone</i>.</p>
<p>Your main quest will be travelling to another country and tell other <i>Azariahans</i>  that The <i>Orikan Stone</i> has been stolen.  You will encounter many challenges throughout your path and will discover that you are an ancient <i>Azariahan</i> soul.</p>
<p>You will fight very powerfull bosses during your travels and try to retrieve <i>The Orikan Stone</i> before a cataclysm happens in <i>Ormonh</i>.</p>

<p>This project began some months ago by a small team of three people, after the completion of a good storyline and game concept.</p>
<p>The plot was created by Guilherme Silva, as well as the art and musical composition. In-game  code is being written by Luís Miguel. SFX are being handled by Ivo Simões. Also, we received some help for concept art and building sketches by Marcela Santana.</p>
<p>We are passionate about the gaming industry and have been working hard on this project. This campaign is very important because, with the kickstarter funds, it will be possible to fully develop this game and, if everything goes the right way, one day establish our own game studio for further releases.</p>
<p>We aim to mix art and gameplay in an incredible gaming experience.</p>

<p>We've divided our objectives in 3 main stages. This is prone to change due to how early in devolopment the game still is. Updates will be released as progress is made.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Berehalem The Orikan Stone is a side scroller RPG that takes place in a magical world called Ormonh.The player will explore amazing  game mechanics like complex battle system based in real martial arts (Kendo, Aikido and Karate Goju Ryu). All the while exploring many places as a sandbox with an upgradable caravan driven by your buddy Doulh the Frog.
Enter this journey of a new generation side scroller with amazing art direction.
 

 

 
 
 
 
 
Berehalem The Orikan Stone is an indie game currently in development with a kick starter campaing that will soon be released on Steam Store.This game is a side scroller RPG that takes place in a magical world called Ormonh.
This world is divided between two divine factions: The Azariah and the Zuggul.
Two different forces that have opposed ideals! 
Azariahans cohabit in peace with all living beings and they believe Ormonh was created to be a place of harmony in the universe. Their duty is to protect it from all evil, especially the Zuggul.
On the other hand, Zuggul are against the Azariah. They believe living beings were created to serve them and to be hunted.
You will play as an Azariahan  called Sahnu  and embark on a journey to a fantastic medieval and technological world with RPG and sandbox mechanics, and a complex battle system created using motion capture tech with the colaboration of real martial arts masters.

 

The Orikan Stone and Berehalem are somehow separated.
The Orikan Stone is the first chapter of a big storyline that we will release. Berehalem is the main title of a large story written by Guilherme Silva and also the name of one of the most powerful divine creatures within the games' universe.
The Orikan Stone takes place in the country known as Sirhils. This is where the player takes control of Sahnu, a 19 year old boy that was brought up under the name of an old swordsman, Hyune, since he was a child.
The story begins when a group of Zuggul attack Hyune and steal the amulet which contains the Orikan Stone.
Your main quest will be travelling to another country and tell other Azariahans  that The Orikan Stone has been stolen.  You will encounter many challenges throughout your path and will discover that you are an ancient Azariahan soul.
You will fight very powerfull bosses during your travels and try to retrieve The Orikan Stone before a cataclysm happens in Ormonh.

 


Deep and immersive narrative
Character progression and customization
Ability to make choices that really affect your progression
Quest based gameplay structure
Rich and interactive maps
Caravan with housing / travel mechanics 
Complex battle system with both weapons and bare hands 
Magic, loot, XP and level up systems  
Gear with variable stats



Magic in the Berehalem universe is very unique and you cannot become a mage merely by practicing or studying it.
In the world of Berehalem, magic is a divine seal to the Azariahan soul. Each Azariahan possesses spells and powers based on his element.
In Orikan Stone, Sahnu has the element of fire and three magic skills:
Fireball
 

Fire Shield
 

Fire Chain
 
 


In the Berehalem universe, Azariahans and Zuggulls have their main weapons connected to their soul. Each weapon is unique and has its own characteristics. You can use other weapons but they are not as effective to kill a Zuggul.
You also have access to melee and ranged weapons:
Melee weapons

Axes
Daggers
Hammers
Iron fist
Nunchaku!
Short, medium and heavy swords
Spears
Sticks

Ranged weapons

Bow
Crossbow
Mechanical hand that shoots darts
Rocks
Shuriken

We wish to increase the arsenal made available to the player but these are the current options.

 

(being textured)
The Caravan will be a very important feature in the game.
With the Caravan, you will be able to travel to other places, furnish it with your loot during travels and other events.
The entirety of the caravan is upgradable.
What can you do with those upgrades?

Armor improvements
Customize its exterior look
Get faster wheels  
Upgrade storage room
Upgrade weapons 

 

 
We intend to make every single object related to the caravan interactable​. 
Also, you are not alone in the Caravan. You will be accompanied by Doulho the Frog.

 


This project began some months ago by a small team of three people, after the completion of a good storyline and game concept.
The plot was created by Guilherme Silva, as well as the art and musical composition. In-game  code is being written by Luís Miguel. SFX are being handled by Ivo Simões. Also, we received some help for concept art and building sketches by Marcela Santana.
We are passionate about the gaming industry and have been working hard on this project. This campaign is very important because, with the kickstarter funds, it will be possible to fully develop this game and, if everything goes the right way, one day establish our own game studio for further releases.
We aim to mix art and gameplay in an incredible gaming experience.
 



We've divided our objectives in 3 main stages. This is prone to change due to how early in devolopment the game still is. Updates will be released as progress is made.




 
 
All the funds go to Berehalem The Orikan Stone' s devolopment, even if we cannot reach our set goal.

​
The game is being developed with Blender and Unity.
We started with Autodesk Maya (student version) but due the comercial license pricing we are working with Blender.
We are in an initial phase, building the world of Berehalem. We already have some models and code done:


Noguya a magical creature  (done ✓)
Initial behavior trees for npc and characters  (done ✓) 
Environment elements (mountains, nature elements, etc) 
Initial models and props

Game animals and environment sound design  (done ✓) 
Game name and logo licence 
Death system and check point  (done ✓) 
Main menu prototype (done ✓)
Save and load game (done✓)

 

 

We are in the beginning of a project which has our full commitment. However, we lack the necessary resources to reach our full development capacities.
Other than the funding, we find it important to build a passionate community which Indiegogo can provide us with.
If you like this project and you would like to see the game being released, we would be very grateful if you'd participate in this campaign, sharing this and perhaps purchasing a perk.

Perks are our way to gather the resources needed to build the game. Choose the perk that suits you best and contribute to our crownfunding directly.
You will get special items with every perk. For example:


The Blacksmith if you like weapons art work 

The Reader if you are interested in reading the game's storyline 

The Luthier if you want to have the soundtrack arrangements for classical guitar

The Orikan Stone amulet perk to wear it whenever you want

Note 1 - All backers will have their name in the game's credits (except the Beggining of a Journey perk) and receive game updates in their mail box.
Note 2 - Delivery time is only for the perk's title. The correspondent perks items' delivery time may vary.
Our game will not be only a game but a piece of art.

 

One of our biggest  setbacks may be the lack of funding which will delay the proposed launch date.
We know it is a challenge to build a game from scratch, but we have already taken ourselves up to this task of finish it.

Estimated release date - March, 2017This is a hobby project of mine that I have been working on for quite some time now. As a big fan of post-apocalyptic theme eventually I decided to make it more complex and immersive and added a bunch of new features. The video shows you what is done so far to give you the maximum information about the project. Your feedback and support will determine if this project has a future so please comment - any thought, opinion or suggestion will be greatly appreciated. If you have any questions please leave it in the comment section or contact me through the ""Ask a question"" option - I will gladly respond to everyone as soon as I can. March, 2018An unknown virus begins to spread throughout the world. It was more devastating than anything we have ever seen before sweeping hundreds of millions of lives into oblivion. As governments fall pure chaos ensues. Military arsenals around the world are left in hands of paranoid generals. Fear and political mistrust mounts with each hour!October 5th, 2019 Claiming that the virus is actually a biological weapon and the first step of U.S. strategy to establish control in South East Asia, North Korea launches a nuclear attack on its southern neighbor targeting U.S. forces locations. U.S. counter-strikes trigger a chain reaction that drags in China and Russia and escalates into a mutually destructive nuclear showdown!...and so, plunging the world into nuclear apocalypse we swiftly finished what the disease had started!20 years later survivors are living mostly in countryside. The water is polluted and food is scarce. Factions are formed to provide security from bandits. As more gangs and factions emerge from the wasteland violent conflicts erupt. You begin as a member of a faction called “Skiff”. A faction eliminated by a powerful rivaling gang calling themselves “Federals”.You now roam the wasteland trying to survive, looking for friends and allies to help the resistance forces stop the reign of “Federals”. LocationsFind and search different locations. Abandoned buildings, old vehicles, crash sites, survivor camps, secret locations etc. There will be up to 80 different locations. SearchSearch every location for items and special encounters. Use tools like crowbars and flashlights to increase your search success. Search forest for mushrooms, berries, plants etc. Use axes, machetes etc. to gather woods for campfire or material to craft different items. Meet peopleMeet different people from different factions. Talk, trade or fight to get what you need. Food and WaterFind food and water to stay alive. You can find plants, berries, mushrooms. Catch insects, snakes or build traps for small animals. You can also trade or kill other humans to get their food. Look out for old or raw food. Most foods can expire and get worse with each turn. Eating old or raw food can cause health problems.  You can cook raw food. HealthLook after unit health, physical condition and morale by providing medicine, bandages, trauma kits and painkillers. Coffee, cigarettes and alcohol can be used to boost morale. Physical condition can be regained by setting up camps and resting. Low health and trauma decrease the amount of moves your unit can make per turn. Low stats increase chance of getting diseases and traumas while wandering the wasteland. Higher stats minimize the chance of getting injuries while searching locations and allow you to use your weapons more effectively. EquipmentEquip your units with weapons, helmets and armor. There will be 8 weapon categories available – melee weapons, bows and crossbows, pistols, shotguns, sub-machine guns, assault rifles, machine guns, and hunting rifles. More than 50 weapons in total. Use bags to increase the amount of items and weight that your unit can carry. Clothes provide warmth and prevent from getting sick. Use binoculars and clothing with camouflage to increase your chances of avoiding bandits and other hostile elements. Use different tools to increase your search abilities. Some places need special tools to be searched (Wrench, Screwdriver, Pliers etc. are needed to search for spare parts in old vehicles). VehicleVehicle can be equipped with weapon and armor. Spare parts are needed to repair systems like engine, chassis, transmission etc. Fuel and oil is needed to drive. Driving without oil damages systems. Damaged systems increase vehicle fuel consumption. Using roads minimizes fuel consumption. CampCreate camps to rest your units and regain their physical condition. But look for the right weather conditions – starting a fire in bad weather can be difficult. Some weather conditions require a shelter in order to build a camp. For that you can use abandoned buildings, tents or build a shelter yourself. Vehicle can be used as shelter too. Use axes or machetes to gather dry woods for the fire. It is hard to build a fire with wet woods. Wet woods make you look after the fire more that is why your units will regain less physical condition when using wet woods for fire. Food and water is also required for a camp – the more pristine food you will use the more condition you will regain. WeatherDifferent weather conditions have various consequences – in bad weather units can lose up to 2 moves per turn. Vehicle can lose 1 move per turn. Morale and physical condition decreases faster in bad weather conditions. These are the features and stuff needed to finish the project.FightingA fighting system must be created to resolve any conflicts you may have with the nice wasteland people. TradingTrading feature may come in handy when you do not have the ability to just take what you want. CraftingA crafting system is essential to make different useful items and weapons - cook food, make bandages from old rags, create medicine from plants, berries and mushrooms, build traps for small animals, create improvised shelters etc. Content    Other major part of the project that has to be created besides the Fighting, Trading, Crafting and other smaller systems is the content of the game.-Map: Currently only 1/20 of the map is created. The game supports up to 6 such maps. If the project keeps growing new maps will be added with time allowing to explore huge areas and find interesting stuff and people.-Locations and objects: at least 80 searchable objects and locations are planned.-Lots and lots of items: at least 50 weapons are planned.

<br/><h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Hi there. I'm Patric Henson, a card and board game designer from Wichita, KS. I grew up playing card games and board games, and I am very passionate about them. When I was younger, I often found myself noticing that certain rules could be improved, or slight alterations to games could be made to make them more fun. That naturally led into me making my own games!</p>
<p>This campaign is to produce the first of many games that I have designed; A deck-building game with a street racing theme. You purchase new parts for your vehicle and use a variety of driving maneuvers to speed past your opponents, but do mind the curves in the road! The game is complete with conditions such as rain, traffic, and police chases!</p>
<p>This game is, with the exception of a few minor and mostly cosmetic alterations, a finished project. It has been play-tested for countless hours, critiqued, improved, critiqued some more, and then improved some more etc., etc.</p>

</div><div> <p>If the funding goal is met the expenses will look like this:</p> <ul> <li>The cost per unit is $43.24, plus $9.20 each to ship them to backers (that's what the shipping costed me to have the demo sent to my house)</li>
<li>Indiegogo Fees: $150</li>
<li>PayPal Fees: $150</li> <li>This is a fixed funding project, so it will not be funded if I do not at least reach the funding goal (since I would lose a ton of money fulfilling backer rewards if I can't reach the bulk discount amount)</li>
<li>Total: $2,922 for 50 units of the game.</li> </ul>
<div>Obviously, my profit margin is nonexistent. The goal is just to get this game out to those who would enjoy it. I've put a lot into this game and I want to get it out there.</div>

<li>
<b>$6,000:</b> <i>Hand delivery!</i> If we reach this goal, I will personally deliver backer rewards to local backers. This would apply to those living in the Wichita, KS metro area, but, given enough interest and support, I may be able to go further. Message me if you have any questions. <i>Note:</i> I reserve the right to opt to mail the rewards in the event that I cannot make contact with the backer or they are not present at agreed upon delivery time, or the delivery would be unsafe (dog in yard, etc).</li>
<li>
<b>$9,000:</b>  RPM Street <i>Poster!</i> At this level, every backer who pledges at least $15 will receive a unique RPM Street poster along with any other applicable rewards!</li>

<b>$12,000:</b> <i>Big time quality upgrade!</i> The game will be produced by Quality Playing Cards, Inc.; a company that has unparalleled quality and an A+ with the BBB (Better Business Bureau)!!</li>

<b>$15,000:</b> <i>The DUB Goal!</i> Everyone will have their games doubled! Did you order 10 copies? If we hit $15k you'll get 20 instead! Even if you just ordered 1, you'll have 2 copies headed your way!</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This is a launching point for me to start doing something I really enjoy. I have about a dozen games at various levels of development. My goal is to make games that people will love to play as much as the games I grew up playing and the ones I play today. If I can get this game out there and get my foot into this niche field, it will segue into making many more games for everyone to enjoy!</p>

</div><div> <p>I have put so much time and effort into this game. Hundreds of hours spent around work, volunteering, and family obligations. It was a challenge to get this far, and I couldn't have done it without the support of my wonderful wife. The vast majority of the work on my end, development and design, is already done. I've already Trademarked my logo. All I need is the money to get my dream off of the ground.</p>
<p>If I reach the $12k stretch goal, I might have to change the format of my files somewhat, which could take some time. So if that is the case, it may or may not be delivered by the estimated date. Beyond that, I can't foresee anything else that has any reasonable chance of going wrong. If I run into anything unexpected, I will adapt. I have put far too much work into this game to give up that easily!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Hi there. I'm Patric Henson, a card and board game designer from Wichita, KS. I grew up playing card games and board games, and I am very passionate about them. When I was younger, I often found myself noticing that certain rules could be improved, or slight alterations to games could be made to make them more fun. That naturally led into me making my own games!
This campaign is to produce the first of many games that I have designed; A deck-building game with a street racing theme. You purchase new parts for your vehicle and use a variety of driving maneuvers to speed past your opponents, but do mind the curves in the road! The game is complete with conditions such as rain, traffic, and police chases!
This game is, with the exception of a few minor and mostly cosmetic alterations, a finished project. It has been play-tested for countless hours, critiqued, improved, critiqued some more, and then improved some more etc., etc.


What We Need

 If the funding goal is met the expenses will look like this:  The cost per unit is $43.24, plus $9.20 each to ship them to backers (that's what the shipping costed me to have the demo sent to my house)
Indiegogo Fees: $150
PayPal Fees: $150 This is a fixed funding project, so it will not be funded if I do not at least reach the funding goal (since I would lose a ton of money fulfilling backer rewards if I can't reach the bulk discount amount)
Total: $2,922 for 50 units of the game. 
Obviously, my profit margin is nonexistent. The goal is just to get this game out to those who would enjoy it. I've put a lot into this game and I want to get it out there.

Stretch Goals

As it goes in production; Higher volume equals lower costs per unit, so the more money I save on production, the more value I will add to your rewards.


$6,000: Hand delivery! If we reach this goal, I will personally deliver backer rewards to local backers. This would apply to those living in the Wichita, KS metro area, but, given enough interest and support, I may be able to go further. Message me if you have any questions. Note: I reserve the right to opt to mail the rewards in the event that I cannot make contact with the backer or they are not present at agreed upon delivery time, or the delivery would be unsafe (dog in yard, etc).

$9,000:  RPM Street Poster! At this level, every backer who pledges at least $15 will receive a unique RPM Street poster along with any other applicable rewards!

$12,000: Big time quality upgrade! The game will be produced by Quality Playing Cards, Inc.; a company that has unparalleled quality and an A+ with the BBB (Better Business Bureau)!!

$15,000: The DUB Goal! Everyone will have their games doubled! Did you order 10 copies? If we hit $15k you'll get 20 instead! Even if you just ordered 1, you'll have 2 copies headed your way!



The Impact This is a launching point for me to start doing something I really enjoy. I have about a dozen games at various levels of development. My goal is to make games that people will love to play as much as the games I grew up playing and the ones I play today. If I can get this game out there and get my foot into this niche field, it will segue into making many more games for everyone to enjoy!


Risks & Challenges
 I have put so much time and effort into this game. Hundreds of hours spent around work, volunteering, and family obligations. It was a challenge to get this far, and I couldn't have done it without the support of my wonderful wife. The vast majority of the work on my end, development and design, is already done. I've already Trademarked my logo. All I need is the money to get my dream off of the ground.
If I reach the $12k stretch goal, I might have to change the format of my files somewhat, which could take some time. So if that is the case, it may or may not be delivered by the estimated date. Beyond that, I can't foresee anything else that has any reasonable chance of going wrong. If I run into anything unexpected, I will adapt. I have put far too much work into this game to give up that easily!
    Other Ways You Can Help Even if you can't contribute, if you like what I'm trying to accomplish here, please share this with your friends, especially those into cars or games. You can use social media, perhaps even share a link to the Facebook Pages of local gaming stores. So, please, use those share tools and make some noise about this campaign!
Thanks

this ProjectWe need help making an English version of Pini
engine.We need $12,000 to translate from Korean to
English.
What
is Pini-Engine?Pini engine is a game engine. You can make
any games with it, but It is most focused on making visual novel and text adventure
genres.It helps developers who do not know in-depth programming to easily create games.It supports <Windows>,
<Android> and <iOS> builds and IDE can run on <Windows>,
<Mac> and Linux.You can add any feature of engine via Lua script.

Why
use Pini-Engine?
There are various powerful features that
can help non-programmers to create games.
These are Pini engine’s remarkable features
:


Include script language that is really easy to learn.But it’s totally written in Hangul (Korean). We need to globalize it
by using English.


And also includes powerful auto complete environment.When you write down codes, Help window will always follow your
cursor



In-app-purchase (pay-to-win) feature can be added with just 2 lines of codeYou can make free-to-play game very easily. 



Ads cab be added with just clicking on a project setting menuYou can use optimized ads from ADOP Inc to make profit


Guide lines for visualization of code flowUsually, the flow of visual novel is pretty complex. So we support
flow chart manager for it. 


Pini engin also gives free resources that include background images
and background musics. 

Why
do we need your help?
At this moment, there is only a Korean
version. But we want it to help every developer in the world. Getting a good quality
translation takes money and efforts.
Without your help we can’t make the English
version. Because we are not going to make it commercial. It be free for indie
developers foever.Indiegogo goals

<ul>
<p>Hi,
	I'm Zsombor ! I'm a 30 year-old male, living in Hungary, Budapest.<br/>I
	have learned graphic design but making/designing video games is
	closer to my desires.<br/>I have many many game ideas but one of my
	favourite is Almag, so my dream is to make this RPG and release it
	on PC-MAC-Smart phones  and a Nintendo home console!<br/>
</p>
<p>It
is a classic 2D JRPG style game based on photos.<br/>The environments,
music and the story are influenced by European folk tales,Role
Playing games of the 90', Anime and puppetshows-clay animations.</p>
<br/>With
	your help, I can make a game which revives a forgotten era of
	children's tale from the 60's-70's-80's with keeping the style in
	modern 2D RPG style, using never seen solutions such as making
	enemies from organic objects you can see every day on the ground .
<br/>
</ul>
<h3>                                  <b>My Goals</b>
</h3>
<p> I
will need to ask for 40 000 USD to be sure that I can finish this
game. I need to rent a studio place where I can make this with the
artists I hire and where I can work with my programmers. I have to
re-make the figures you can see in the trailer and make a much better
animation for them using Esoteric Software Spine. I need to pay for
the sound effects and my brother who makes the brilliant music.
Beside PC - Mac and Smart phones, I would like to release it on Wii U
or to the next gen home console as well, so I need to buy the dev kit
set and pay for the ports. If things are going well, I will consider
other home consoles as well or maybe even a handle.<br/></p>

<h3>                                <b>Story Of The Idea</b>
</h3>When
	I got this idea in 2008, the only unique thing was the graphics
	first. We had seen a couple of 2D RPG's already using hand drawn
	graphics and sprites and we’d seen 2D RPG's using 3D rendered
	graphics as well. So my idea was to make a real, photo based tile
	set for an RPG but in the end I left the tile set idea and I started
	building up the whole picture instead.  I thought and I’m
	still thinking today that today video game graphics are almost on a
	life-like level but still, if you look at a photo next to a CGI,
	your eyes will tell the difference somehow.  However, as time
	passed I had got more and more ideas and now I have many unique
	ideas for the story, characters, enemies and lands also. There is a
	part of the project which is as unique as the art style, and it’s
	the folk tale influence. I was lucky that I was born in a European
	country which has countless ancient folk tales and our neighbouring
	countries have also many folk tales. When I was a kid they still
	showed them on TV and told them in schools or as bed time stories.
	Every folk tale has something brilliant in it. Like a strange
	weapon, a character, or a clever solution. Personally, I think folk
	tales have almost bottomless ideas. The game: Legend of Zelda has
	many unique and famous elements and items but believe me, in folk
	tales there are ten times more items like those. So will my game use
	those things directly from those folk tales? Not quite. Everything
	in the game will be completely from my fantasy, but now I have a
	long list I collected from tales and I will definitely try to seed
	them into the game some way. So as for the music. My whole family is
	connected in some way to folk music and my brother is a professional
	musician. So as with the music, there also will be a strong folk
	influence beside of the usual medieval fantasy game influence. The
	other influence from this mixture is the Japanese RPG and Anime. My
	favourite era in video games was the snes-psx era, mostly because of
	their RPG titles. Secret of mana, Crono trigger, etc... are still my
	favourite RPG games and since I want to make a 2D RPG game, it is
	obvious that I will try to plant some feelings from those games into
	mine. As for the graphics again, using real life models and natural
	objects like stones, nuts and cones I think I can reach a really
	charming look which fits very well also with the folk tale line and
	with the traditional JRPG line as well. Building complete
	towns-forests-castles sounds very hard and it certainly is. However
	if I make something, I can use it again in a different perspective
	so it would be like a real life 3D tile set in the end, which makes
	it more and more easy as I go further in the making.<br/><br/>The
	game will have definitely a colourful look but my aim is to make it
	enjoyable not just for the younger audience but for the more matured
	ones as well since I'm planning to use many elements and symbols
	with deep meanings. It definitely won't be bloody or heavily dark
	but some things still could be ""scary"".<br/>
<h3></h3>My
	aim with the story and the world is to reach an atmosphere which
	feels like an endless lost world with places where nobody ever set
	foot on before or they are abandoned long ago. I have many ideas for
	strange atmospheric places or never seen creatures.<br/>
<ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>                        Challenges Of The Project</h3>
<p>I
	need to be a man who can control many people and direct the game as

	dialogues but has to take a serious part in the making of the

	characters at the same time.<br/></p> <p> </p>
I

<h3>Short Summary:</h3>
<p>Quadra Combat is a puzzle/fighting game that combines the color-matching, tile-clearing action of games like Bejeweled or Columns with the character meta and competitive nature of games like Mortal Kombat or Smash Bros. It's easy to learn, hard to master, and rewards both wit and reflexes.<br/><br/>We plan on implementing the following features should we reach initial funding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local multiplayer</li>
<li>10 or more characters with unique stats and abilities to play as and master</li>
<li>An authentic chiptune soundtrack, composed by SpectralAves</li>
<li>Plenty of tough but fair gameplay, loaded with replay value</li>
</ul>
<p>Our aim is to create an arcade-inspired game that focuses on immediacy and replay value. To accomplish this, we've decided to use the Godot Engine, as it is free, lightweight, open-source, and its dedicated 2D mode allows for a pixel-perfect execution of our desired retro aesthetic.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Currently, Quadra Combat is sitting at about 50% completion. We've already gotten all of the base game's mechanics down, as well as a lot of the more basic, UI-related stuff. Our AI is functional, but certainly needs more time in development before it becomes competent enough to play our game well. Currently, it's more-or-less playable, but we need additional money and time for more features, art, and polish before our game hits the market.<br/><br/>What we're asking for is about $5,000 USD and about six to seven months time to get our game ready for the limelight. Seeing as how our game is about half-finished, this ought to give us enough time to add all the features we want and really polish this game to a shine.<br/><br/>We also have some stretch goals in mind, these goals include the following:</p>
<p>$5,000 USD - Our game is released on PC and Linux, with all the aforementioned features, sometime in the middle of this year.<br/><br/>$7,000 USD - We add the option for Network Multiplayer.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While the concept of a puzzle/fighter isn't exactly new (see Dossun! Ganseki Battle, Columns III, Doctor Mario, etc...), it's certainly not something you see done much any more. Many games that fall within this genre aren't playable on modern hardware without emulation, which is a shame because we feel that the puzzle/fighter genre is one who's time never came, and one with a mountain of untapped potential. We're hoping to resurrect the concept of the puzzle/fighter and do it proper justice! <br/><br/>The concept of Quadra Combat came about when Dead Stuff's producer/designer discovered an English ROM-hack of the previously Japan-only game Dossun: Ganseki Battle.<br/><br/>Dossun is a troublesome game to get attached to. On one hand, it has tight combat and a challenging AI with plenty of replay value. On the other hand, it only has 9 characters (three of which are made redundant due to the way they're balanced), the soundtrack is either grating or uninspired, and the themes and characters are your generic fantasy fare. We plan to take what we like about Dossun (mainly its mechanics), preserve that, and change the rest into something more unique and interesting.<br/><br/>-Lackluster soundtrack? We've got chiptune composer SpectralAves to solve that problem.<br/>-Unbalanced character roster? We've got a 16+ move roster, speed stats, as well as an upcoming Discord server full of project backers and beta testers to help balance characters before launch.<br/>-Generic fantasy theming? We're leaning into a more sci-fi direction, with far wackier and unique characters from across the galaxy.<br/><br/>We plan to to take Dossun and games like it and learn from them, improve upon them, and carve out our own identity using our own ideas in the process. We hope you'll be along for this ride.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>So far, our producer/lead designer has been funding development alone using the disposable income generated by his day job in the IT industry. As the project has grown, and as we've hired more freelance artists and programmers, that method has proved to not be sustainable at this stage in development. In fact, everyone currently involved with production has their own day job as well as other projects that require their attention.<br/><br/>We're going to need this money to speed up development and retain the talented people that we've hired. Otherwise, production will slow to a crawl and all this hard work might end up being for nothing in the end.<br/><br/>We can't sit idly by and let that happen, and THAT is where you come in.</p>

<p><strong>Next.Land</strong> is a project that I started developing in my free time. At the beginning, it was only a small experiment to demonstrate amazing new possibilities of modern web browsers, especially WebGL technology. Over time, it has turned a into simple game designed for casual players. A beautiful demo is already available for preview. Gameplay, balance, tempo and all the things that make a game great are already mapped out but not yet obvious in the demo.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;background-color: #FFB8B8;padding:10px;margin-bottom:0;""><strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;background-color: #FFDBDB;padding:10px;margin-top:0;""><i>Please note that this demo has a very limited gameplay. It is more like an early alpha preview of the game. It uses dummy data and many features are not available yet.</i></p>
<p>The main purpose of this campaign is to promote my game. I want to attract a wide audience of players. I’m looking for inspiration and feedback from people who know and love strategic games. Backers will receive perks but the game will never be pay to win. I am very grateful for your support.</p>

<p>All funds raised by the crowdfunding campaign will be used primary for computer and network infrastructure. With a solid server performance the game will be able to run without issues.

<p>Developing a game is a costly business. I have already invested a lot of resources into this project and I will keep doing this, but your help is very welcome. All I can do is to provide you as much information as possible so you are able to decide on your support.</p>

<h4 style=""width: 100%;background-color:#333;color: #fff;padding:7px 15px;border-left:10px solid;border-color: #47A1BF;"">The Team</h4>
<p>I am the creator and the only developer right now. <strong>Next.Land</strong> is my personal project that I started developing in my free time. I can not compete with top video game makers and bring you the ultimate gameplay, graphics or whatever. I just want to bring you a simple game that is fun to play. I hope that this game will become popular and I will be able to expand the team and bring you an even better gaming experience.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470055258/txcdn13rjepi2wnncosu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h4 style=""width: 100%;background-color:#333;color: #fff;padding:7px 15px;border-left:10px solid;border-color: #47A1BF;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h4>
<p>Game development is a difficult task. Because of various unforeseen events, it is common for game production to be delayed. I am doing everything I can to avoid extended deadlines or delayed development, but there is always a risk that this could happen. To keep you updated, I post regular articles about the progress on my DEV blog.</p>
<p>Another big problem is an unknown player base at this moment. It is a big difference to provide computer infrastructure for one hundred players and for one hundred thousand players. No one wants to play a game that is laggy and slow. Running crowdfunding campaigns is a great way to get at least a basic prediction for this.</p>
<p>With your help, I can deal with various obstacles that are in the way, and make sure you will be able to enjoy <strong>Next.Land</strong> soon.</p>

<p>I totally understand that some people just can't contribute. Don't worry, <strong>Next.Land</strong> is a free to play game. You will get a full, unrestricted access even with a non-premium account. There are still other ways you can help:</p>

Brief Intro
Next.Land is a project that I started developing in my free time. At the beginning, it was only a small experiment to demonstrate amazing new possibilities of modern web browsers, especially WebGL technology. Over time, it has turned a into simple game designed for casual players. A beautiful demo is already available for preview. Gameplay, balance, tempo and all the things that make a game great are already mapped out but not yet obvious in the demo.
IMPORTANT NOTICE
Please note that this demo has a very limited gameplay. It is more like an early alpha preview of the game. It uses dummy data and many features are not available yet.
The main purpose of this campaign is to promote my game. I want to attract a wide audience of players. I’m looking for inspiration and feedback from people who know and love strategic games. Backers will receive perks but the game will never be pay to win. I am very grateful for your support.

The Funds
All funds raised by the crowdfunding campaign will be used primary for computer and network infrastructure. With a solid server performance the game will be able to run without issues. Insufficient server performance could disappoint many players and ruin the gameplay completely. Below you can see some basic distribution of your money raised in the campaign.


Developing a game is a costly business. I have already invested a lot of resources into this project and I will keep doing this, but your help is very welcome. All I can do is to provide you as much information as possible so you are able to decide on your support.
 
The Team
I am the creator and the only developer right now. Next.Land is my personal project that I started developing in my free time. I can not compete with top video game makers and bring you the ultimate gameplay, graphics or whatever. I just want to bring you a simple game that is fun to play. I hope that this game will become popular and I will be able to expand the team and bring you an even better gaming experience.

 
Risks & Challenges
Game development is a difficult task. Because of various unforeseen events, it is common for game production to be delayed. I am doing everything I can to avoid extended deadlines or delayed development, but there is always a risk that this could happen. To keep you updated, I post regular articles about the progress on my DEV blog.
Another big problem is an unknown player base at this moment. It is a big difference to provide computer infrastructure for one hundred players and for one hundred thousand players. No one wants to play a game that is laggy and slow. Running crowdfunding campaigns is a great way to get at least a basic prediction for this.
With your help, I can deal with various obstacles that are in the way, and make sure you will be able to enjoy Next.Land soon.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
I totally understand that some people just can't contribute. Don't worry, Next.Land is a free to play game. You will get a full, unrestricted access even with a non-premium account. There are still other ways you can help:

The fact, that there is no police in the space and you should handle all 50levels by yourself, adds complexity.   But you will manage! Because the girl’s destiny is up to you and it depends on youwhether she is able to unravel missing father secret.    We desire to immerse players into playing field with custom-made music. For thisreason we had found two genius musicians who are professionals in their genres.   NickBee is brilliant ukrainian dnb-composer worldwide famous. We have created 3soundtracks in conjunction with him. DNB style from NickBee will encourage to winand complete various challenges in the plot also will fill you up with energy.   Ekca Liena is last but not least talented musician dark ambient, drone and noise,who creates ambient soundtracks which will give goosebumps to each and everyone. It would be difficultto show all spice of emotions only through gameplay and design. Ekca Liena’s trackslet player to literally feel danger, fear and feel for Iri.   It is planned to complement background music, make it more vivid and intriguing.You would be able to understand that Iri’s world is wonderful and unique with thevery first sound notes and meters passed with bathyscaphe.   There is a plan to gather all required value for the game release.      And we will do our best to be so. In case of fail of first try we will try our offer once again in order to gather required amount of money for the project release.      We have gigantic desire and goal which we hope to reach due to your help.",23.0,2,"1 Campaign

</h3> <p></p>
Bad Roll Games is a small Spanish company formed up by three friends, that has been working for more than a year on the addictive tabletop game <b>Punkapocalyptic</b>. During this time we have put on the market several high-quality and detailed miniatures for our first two factions, <b>Gangers </b>and <b>Mutards</b>. You can check them out at our webpage, where you will also be able to download the rulebook and gang sheets for free, or visit our Facebook or Twitter accounts.<p> </p> </div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">Basically our game is a fast-paced skirmish showdown between rival gangs, played with 5 to 10 30 mm scale miniatures in a post-apocalyptic, barren and desolate environment known as the Wasteland. If you are into skirmish games, wargames in general, apocalyptic settings or just like to paint superb minis made by some of the best sculptors in the market these days, this game is for you. Don't hesitate to visit our <a href=""www.badrollgames.com/en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.badrollgames.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> to know more about the background of this setting, read a bunch of short stories, watch some cool drawings and maps, or feast your eyes with the miniature galleries.</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">So far we have opted for a more traditional way of funding (that is, puting our own money on the project), but now there is an increasing number of <b>Punkapocalyptic </b>players and they demand to have a wider variety of miniatures and factions to choose from in their games. But we have came to the conclusion that the release rate we can accomplish that way is quite slow for what a game like this requires, so we now hope to get enough funds to release a whole <b>Junkers Starter Pack</b> and even a bunch of extras if we get there.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We can wholeheartedly promise that this crowdfunding will be a <b>true </b>crowdfunding. This is not a pre-sale for miniatures we already have in production, or anything like that. All the money will be used to pay for modelling, production, painting… so this Starter Pack for our third faction can become a reality.<br/></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Thus, we cannot show you any finished miniature for the upcoming faction but only concept drawings of what we want them to be. But we are not newcomers to this market either, so you can check the miniatures we have released so far and see for yourself that the final result is completely up to the expectations or even beyond. We are lucky to have on board renowned top-class modellers such as <span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Julen Galparsoro</b>, <b>Leonardo Escovar</b> or <b>Iván Santurio</b>, and for the production and painting processes we work with the internationally known <b>José Palomares' Bigchild Creatives</b> team.</span></p>

So, what's all this fuss about?
 
Bad Roll Games is a small Spanish company formed up by three friends, that has been working for more than a year on the addictive tabletop game Punkapocalyptic. During this time we have put on the market several high-quality and detailed miniatures for our first two factions, Gangers and Mutards. You can check them out at our webpage, where you will also be able to download the rulebook and gang sheets for free, or visit our Facebook or Twitter accounts.  Basically our game is a fast-paced skirmish showdown between rival gangs, played with 5 to 10 30 mm scale miniatures in a post-apocalyptic, barren and desolate environment known as the Wasteland. If you are into skirmish games, wargames in general, apocalyptic settings or just like to paint superb minis made by some of the best sculptors in the market these days, this game is for you. Don't hesitate to visit our website to know more about the background of this setting, read a bunch of short stories, watch some cool drawings and maps, or feast your eyes with the miniature galleries.



Why a crowdfunding campaign?
So far we have opted for a more traditional way of funding (that is, puting our own money on the project), but now there is an increasing number of Punkapocalyptic players and they demand to have a wider variety of miniatures and factions to choose from in their games. But we have came to the conclusion that the release rate we can accomplish that way is quite slow for what a game like this requires, so we now hope to get enough funds to release a whole Junkers Starter Pack and even a bunch of extras if we get there.
We can wholeheartedly promise that this crowdfunding will be a true crowdfunding. This is not a pre-sale for miniatures we already have in production, or anything like that. All the money will be used to pay for modelling, production, painting… so this Starter Pack for our third faction can become a reality.



Thus, we cannot show you any finished miniature for the upcoming faction but only concept drawings of what we want them to be. But we are not newcomers to this market either, so you can check the miniatures we have released so far and see for yourself that the final result is completely up to the expectations or even beyond. We are lucky to have on board renowned top-class modellers such as Julen Galparsoro, Leonardo Escovar or Iván Santurio, and for the production and painting processes we work with the internationally known José Palomares' Bigchild Creatives team.







Nice, but why should I put my money on it?
We are offering the Junkers Starter Pack, with metal miniatures, at a special price for trusting us, as well as an exclusive resin miniature designed by us and modelled by RN Estudio. But besides, in case you didn't know us from before, you will be able to get any miniature from our catalogue at a discounted price. And once we reach our main target you will continue to unlock some juicy extras, most of which you will be getting for free with most of the pledge levels.The bulk of this money will be used to pay for the modelling, production and painting processes. And if we get more money pass the minimum, it will be invested in unlockable goodies. If at the end we still have any remaining cash available, it would be spent to keep Punkapocalyptic growing and moving forward with new products.Interested already? Let's get started.



 So far, so good. Let's do this.






You will see the campaign progress indicated in this map. As you can see, we expect you to be quite generous and unlock several add-ons many of which will be free for most of the pledge levels. So don't be shy and spread the word, tell your friends, rob your grandma and scrap your wallet off your last one penny!
(Warning: There is some important info about shipping costs scrolling down to the bottom of the page)

1 € Pledge level - Support the Wasteland




Maybe you are the last good-hearted Wastelander out there. Whether you are a successful scavenger or just shit money, we really don't care. A bullet is a bullet and we need all the ones we can get! Thanks a lot for believing in us and throwing a couple bucks (or quids, or eypos, or whatever currency you use) in our general direction. We would say we love you, but we are tough Wasteland guys, so we won't do it.

8/9 € Pledge level - Rummagin' through trash



You are just looking for a piece or two from our stockage, and that's perfectly fine. If you don't want to get a full Starter Pack or you want to add extra miniatures to any other pledge level, pick your choice of individual miniatures here. Most of the Punkapocalyptic minis are 8 € each, except the Mutard Pit Beast and the exclusive Indiegogo miniature for this campaign, the Pit Fighter known as Eightfingers, which are 9 €.

42 € Pledge level - Scrapbridge neighbor




You really want to start a Punkapocalyptic gang and know the best way to do it is getting a Starter Pack. Hell, that's exactly what they are for! For just 42 dirty euros (or 38, if you are fast enough to benefit from the Early Bird option) you can choose any of the three available Starter Packs, including of course the Junkers one we are funding here. Congratulations, you are now officially a Wasteland wacko!
This pledge level also grants you the Eightfingers exclusive Indiegogo miniature and all the extras unlocked during the campaign.

74 € Pledge level - Twice as good



You want to start playing Punkapocalyptic and you even have a friend to do it with! Awesome! For just 74 petty euros (or 68, if you are fast enough to benefit from the Early Bird option) you can choose any two of the available Starter Packs, including of course the Junkers one we are funding here. Congratulations, you and your buddy are now officially Wasteland nuts!
This pledge level also grants you the Eightfingers exclusive Indiegogo miniature and all the extras unlocked during the campaign.

120 € Pledge level - Wasteland hoarder



You want it all and you want it now! That's what we call focus! In exchange for your 120 greens (or 110, if you are fast enough to benefit from the Early Bird option) you will get ALL the miniatures in the Punkapocalyptic catalog, stock, warehouse, garage or wherever those little bastards are hiding. And if we come across any of our own personal miniatures we don't like anymore, we will throw them in too! Holy shit, this is crazy!
This pledge level also grants you the Eightfingers exclusive Indiegogo miniature and all the extras unlocked during the campaign.

1000 € Pledge level - Ayatollah of Rock and Rolla


One lucky backer will get his own miniature home! The first one with 1000 spare euros in his pocket and willing to give them to us, will have the chance to work with our graphic designer and create a miniature just the way he likes. That 30 mm miniature will be unique, and the backer will receive the green master only for himself so he can caress it endlessly while repeating ""My precioussssss!"" in a low voice. And if we really are in the mood we can even make up some special gameplay rules for this mini, so he can use it in his games for beating the crap out of his mates! Cool!
As a token of our gratitude, this pledge level also grants you for free the Junkers Starter Pack, the Eightfingers exclusive Indiegogo miniature and all the extras unlocked during the campaign.

""I approof this shit, by it now!"", says pit fighter star and two-times ""Da Great Blow"" winner, Eightfingers.



The pretty unlockable extra thingies

About the dreaded shipping costs
All packages will be shipped from Spain, by signed for mail and with tracking number. PLEASE ADD the following amount to your total pledge to cover the shipping costs:Spain: 5 €European Union: 9 €Rest of the World: 13 €To keep these shipping costs to a minimum, all miniatures, extras, bases, markers or anything else included in this campaign will be sent to our backers without any type of blister or box that could increase them due to its bulk or additional weight. If you want to receive your goodies in their proper box or packaging, please tell us so at the end of the campaign, but be aware that you will have to pay for the additional handling and shipping costs.




Risks, challenges and deadlines


Our previous work backs us up. We are a firm working on the miniature market for more than a year now and those companies we collaborate with deserve our greatest trust. Besides, as you can never be sure that you won’t have any setback during the process, we have not only secured several modellers for this campaign, but we also have some more “in reserve” in case any of them fails us.
Our aim is to be able to serve all the miniatures, items and extras unlocked in this campaign within a deadline of six months time from its end. That is, we expect you to have all your nice goodies for Christmas. We have deliberately set quite a generous deadline for this project to compensate any unforeseen mishap, but being honest, if everything goes as expected we hope to deliver all the stuff even sooner.
If someone choose its rewards only among those we have already in stock (and have no claim rights to any new unlocked extra), we will send their miniatures in a two weeks time counting from the campaign end.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

Name character - come up with a name to one of the game characters. We will store the names and pull it out from the stack when naming the characters. We can reject your proposal if it is not appropriate for the game's universe. Sad, we know. 
Your name or words in credits - write a couple of words OR your name/nickname to the Backer’s section of the credits.
Portrait on the wall - that's kind of crazy but so the amount of money. We will draw you as a XIX - XX century authoritarian and hang you on the wall in the cabinet where the players are going to issue warrants and review the papers and evidence. It's like they gonna see you one fifth of the game.

Risks & Challenges
The game is going to be released anyway. We have come a long and hard way and we aren't giving up now. The only risk is that it can be delayed. In fact, we have already delayed it for a year. We can execute it, the only problem is time because most of us have other jobs to do. Yet we are progressing, slowly but steadily.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h1><p><span><i>Set in the distant future of 2406, Earth and the colonies of Mars are at the brink of war. Play as Lieutenant-Commander Junius Fahrenheit onboard the Sierra as him and his crew are forced into a fight that will define the future of mankind altogether. <br/><br/>Humans outgrew Earth. After nearly decimating the planet over two hundred years ago, mankind has taken to expanding into space itself. With the invention of efficient, terraforming technology, self-sustaining, man-made ecosystems and reliable space travel, large off-planet colonies and mining posts were soon established to feed the ever-growing human population. The power of the human race grew. However, with power comes corruption. With corruption comes imbalance. With imbalance comes unrest. <br/><br/>With unrest comes war. <br/>Play as Lieutenant-Commander Junius Fahrenheit, a soldier of the United Terran Vanguard onboard the state-of-the-art mining ship, the Sierra, as him and his crew are thrown into humanity’s first interplanetary war. Tasked in protecting Earth and freeing its colonies from under the Ares Confederacy of Mars’ grasp, there’s no question that he must fight to protect everything he stands for… <br/><br/>But what exactly is it he stands for? Who is right? Who is wrong? Does it even matter? <br/>Perhaps there’s more to this than meets the eye.<br/></i></span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span><span>Sierra Ops is the ""idealization"" of our first game,<a href=""http://www.desura.com/games/operation-sd-space-defense"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Operation SD: Space Defense</b></a>, with practically everything improved, including new features such as:</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span><br/></p><p></p><ul>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This new era of humankind looking towards space ushered the furthering of their reach with the advancement of science and technology.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">However, the peace did not last long between Mars and mother Earth.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Many communities and workers that were sent to live and work in Mars encountered dissatisfaction with the lack of support from the Sigil Corporation, Earth’s foremost transnational conglomerate, and the head of humanity’s exploration of space and industrialization of Mars.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The humans living in the red planet, were enlisted to help build the <span>Hephaestus Spaceport</span> – Mars’s first space elevator. After its completion at year 2304, they asserted that its main purpose turned out to be only to help transfer resources so that the people of Earth, could build colonies on the Moon and at the Lagrange points.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The people of Mars felt unjustly treated but at the same time indebted to Sigil for the opportunity to colonize a new frontier.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In the following century, the people of Mars regarded themselves as nothing but laborers; they built the <span>Mondshire</span> station on Earth’s moon for forty years. <span>Neo Hampshire</span> and <span>St. Niliam</span> Colonies soon followed, constructed successfully at the Lagrange points taking around thirty years each.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Sigil Corporation promised them a good life for the completion of each colony project they’ve built, but the humans in Mars noticed that only a few among themselves were given privileges and the colonies turned out to be mostly for the use of Terran immigrants.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In the year 2396, the people of Mars formed a confederation of traders and workers and called themselves as the <span>Ares Confederacy</span>. The people of Mars, being mostly comprised of laborers and engineers, equipped with state-of-the-art mass production equipment on the red planet, decreed full militarization and production of mankind’s finest space warfare assets, some of which were rumored to be gargantuan dreadnaughts, in the hope of proclaiming and preserving their independence from Terran governance.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In February 2406, the present year, the Ares propaganda has spread throughout the Terran stations. The Terran colonists began to realize the harsh conditions the Confederates were forced into and became sympathizers. Ares cells began infiltrating Terran colonies and encouraged the spread of anti-Terran ideology all boosted by the popularity of Ares’ charismatic leaders; soon, dissent rose as the public perception of Terran governance fell.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Months later, the Confederacy mounted take-and-hold operations as well as acts of subterfuge to undermine Terra’s hold over Mars. Their plans were successful; the Terrans were caught off guard. The Confederacy took control of the Lagrange colonies, the Moonbase, and Earth’s orbital space. The orbital blockade created an absolute embargo for all space trade for Earth.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">While the Confederacy meant no harm to civilians, they were ultimately and effectively no more than prisoners of war. The <span>United Terran Vanguard (UTV)</span>, the standing space navy of the Earth Alliance, now mobilizes its assets around Earth’s orbital space to form the very last line of defense.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">While Ares stood to uphold continued aggression against Terra, Sigil’s attempts to defuse the situation in a peaceful manner failed. In an act of desperation, Sigil would invest its resources to strengthen the UTV Fleet and commission the experimental battleship “Sierra” into the frontlines.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><span>Lieutenant Commander Junius Fahrenheit</span>, along with <span>Ensign Claine de Lune</span> and <span>Major Jean Brookes </span>were all tasked to reclaim the stations back under Terran control.

<h1><span><br/></span></h1>
<h1><span>Help make the final push happen, and be part of Sierra Ops's history:</span></h1>
<p>We have been working on the game for the last eleven months, and we're now pushing for the final goal - which is to finish all the story mode elements: set up all the events in game, design the stages and balance their difficulty, and finally add the remaining functionalities in the engine like the inventory system, overworld commands and <b>fleet setup (or <i>""Party Members""</i>, if you will).</b></p>
<p><b>Sierra's weapons will be fully customizable. </b>It is similar to crafting in most games,<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> here are a few examples:</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">1.<i> The missiles' thrusters, explosive type, and armor type can be altered, making its speed/damage/reload time suitable to the players' needs.</i> </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">2. <i>Kinetic cannons' barrels, cannon type and recoil force balancer can be altered, adjusting its power and reload time.</i></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">By supporting us, we offer perks which allow you to have your character in our game. You could be part of the Ares Confederacy Enemy Officials, or a United Terran Vanguard Soldier who could be potentially an obtainable unit or even become a pirate ship that the Sierra may encounter as an obstacle.</span><br/></p>

<h1><span>Risk and Challenges:</span></h1>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>""</i>It is <i>hard</i> to complete a game</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">, we have been there, done that.""</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We have one finished game, and that is <b><i>Operation SD: Space Defense</i></b>  </span><a href=""http://www.desura.com/games/operation-sd-space-defense"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">www.desura.com/games/operation-sd-space-defense</a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> , it took about a year to finish and not all members were able to give full dedication to the project; We were very slow as we have our own priorities and hobbies, and some simply didn't liked the Sci-Fi genre.</span></p>
<p><span>After completing Operation SD: Space Defense together with several heated debates/ arguments/ tears/ sweat/ beers, we were very happy by the end. But the game didn't really did well to the public as it has a lot of flaws. It was frustrating, we failed to sell the game higher than 200 units, making our revenue for the whole year 2012 and 2013 just around 400$-ish and did not even made it to the distributor's 500$ monthly cut.</span></p>
<p><span>After a few months, we decided to create Sierra Ops - an idealization of Operation SD: Space Defense. At first, we were really skeptical and wanted to jump straight to real-time strategy instead. But Jason decided to rebuild Operation SD instead to its ""ideal"" form and the main inspiration was gtd-carthage's redesign of the Sierra. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Since we knew how the original game works, we just had to add more depth to it such as including consequence based storyline development, the overworld system, as well as the further customizations to Sierra's parts and weapons <i>- It was a very straightforward development.</i></span></p>
<p><span>Along the way, w</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">e </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">have met a lot of professional voice actors/actresses who are very supportive to the indie scene. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We have learned a lot in this project, and everyone really did their best to step up their game for Sierra Ops compared to how OSD was being made.</span></p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The biggest risk</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> is that, </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">if we can't reach the funding goal, a few members of the team might need to work on a full time job and we have to cut down the features that should be in game just for the sake of releasing it earlier.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In addition, any unforeseen circumstances may happen, this is life after all, but we do think we are capable of completing Sierra Ops, and make it one of the memorable games of the decade. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We are developers inspired by various titles from Eastern and Western games/novels such as Muv Luv Alternative, Gundam series, Mass Effect, Master of Orion, Freespace, GSB and many other non Sci-Fi novels from Type Moon, R07, Minori and more. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We are also a team of aspiring directors since we were young (we're 25+ now) - we have been joining at several video making contests and we basically know how to execute something, no matter how cliche it is very well. You may take the story trailer as our primary example.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p><b>The challenge</b> we expect from making Sierra Ops is that, since we're stepping up our methods of development, everyone has to get used to the following:</p>
<p>1. New software, such as the Unity game engine and its extensions we've bought recently, because OSD was created from XNA alone and was not Mac/Linux compatible.</p>
<p>2. As for the creative department, the composer has to do advanced mixing of the music, and the CG artists must be capable of delivering a polished style consistently and should appeal the mainstream audience. All of our content are original and we did not took assets from royalty free aside from the planet textures (that were modified severely anyway).</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We are not asking for your support to start the game development,</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> but we are requesting your aid to make the game a lot better to play with the added features. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Every amount we receive from you will help us release the game faster and will make the game a lot more possible to be released this year<b> with the desired and expanded features. </b>And what we'll do in return, is that you will be part of the game's history as a ship Captain or executive, and have your profile written at the lexicon entries.</span><br/></p>

What is Sierra Ops?
Set in the distant future of 2406, Earth and the colonies of Mars are at the brink of war. Play as Lieutenant-Commander Junius Fahrenheit onboard the Sierra as him and his crew are forced into a fight that will define the future of mankind altogether. Humans outgrew Earth. After nearly decimating the planet over two hundred years ago, mankind has taken to expanding into space itself. With the invention of efficient, terraforming technology, self-sustaining, man-made ecosystems and reliable space travel, large off-planet colonies and mining posts were soon established to feed the ever-growing human population. The power of the human race grew. However, with power comes corruption. With corruption comes imbalance. With imbalance comes unrest. With unrest comes war. Play as Lieutenant-Commander Junius Fahrenheit, a soldier of the United Terran Vanguard onboard the state-of-the-art mining ship, the Sierra, as him and his crew are thrown into humanity’s first interplanetary war. Tasked in protecting Earth and freeing its colonies from under the Ares Confederacy of Mars’ grasp, there’s no question that he must fight to protect everything he stands for… But what exactly is it he stands for? Who is right? Who is wrong? Does it even matter? Perhaps there’s more to this than meets the eye.Sierra Ops is the ""idealization"" of our first game,Operation SD: Space Defense, with practically everything improved, including new features such as:
An ""overworld"" system - a second battle layer which comprises a top-down view of all the units and structures in the battlescape. Every second here counts as a minute.
Timed scenarios/non-linear events, the results of which vary based on your choices and battle performance.
Sierra's appearance being customizable.
The ability to take control of a small task force - you will have up to five units with you in battle, according to what you do in the story or side missions.
More stat point allocations, abilities to learn, weapons to prepare in combat, and types of platforms to deploy.
Generally improved User Interface, character artworks, music, and graphics.
Return to NavigationThe Gameplay:Sierra Ops is mainly a Visual Novel which has several branching routes and endings, including some with friendship and romance options as well. The sprites are animated using Live2D technology. 
The player's choices, battle performance, Sierra’s upgrades, and the time spent on completing objectives can affect the storyline's direction and may change it drastically. Maxing out the ship doesn't guarantee a good ending!
The player will play as Junius Fahrenheit, the Captain of the Sierra, and will be experiencing the entirety of the events of the first interplanetary war. The presentation of the story uses a simplistic subtitle-based style with scrolling effects to portray the dialog and characters. The length of these parts will not overshadow gameplay, as the approach will be more similar to most RPGs than Visual Novels.



The Development Screen. This is where the player will use their RUs (Resource Units) to install weapons, upgrades, and platforms. The weapons that are obtained via upgrades aren't the only weapons in game. The Sierra can also upgrade its parts, including some that can be found as the player progresses through the story, and some of them can be a challenge to obtain.





The Overworld. Sierra has a different set of commands at the overworld mode. This mode is a top-down view of the battlescape where the player can observe all allied/enemy units which are on patrol, pursuit, standby mode, or even units that are in combat, for a limited duration. There are time limits in most of the scenarios, and the player must finish the operations before they are deemed as failures.There are only a few locations in the battlescape where the player can access the Development Screen, and most of the time they will be located at docking stations, satellites and your starting location, so the player should plan wisely before heading out to combat.



The Real-time Battle - the player will take control of the Sierra in real-time against the enemy forces. More often than not, the enemy numbers will be overwhelming, but fear not - as Sierra has multiple functions to help the player survive.The player has control over the energy allocation to the Shields, Weapon Systems and Thruster Output respectively (bottom right sliders). Use abilities prudently, assign weapons to designated target types, and deploy platforms strategically.

The Story:


In the year 2207, mankind began expansion into space and made their first steps towards the stars.




With the help of advanced terraforming projects such as large-scale geo-engineering, and the construction of solar heat distribution modules, the century’s worth of endeavor pays off, making Mars a relatively safe, habitable planet.



This new era of humankind looking towards space ushered the furthering of their reach with the advancement of science and technology.
However, the peace did not last long between Mars and mother Earth.



Many communities and workers that were sent to live and work in Mars encountered dissatisfaction with the lack of support from the Sigil Corporation, Earth’s foremost transnational conglomerate, and the head of humanity’s exploration of space and industrialization of Mars.
The humans living in the red planet, were enlisted to help build the Hephaestus Spaceport – Mars’s first space elevator. After its completion at year 2304, they asserted that its main purpose turned out to be only to help transfer resources so that the people of Earth, could build colonies on the Moon and at the Lagrange points.
The people of Mars felt unjustly treated but at the same time indebted to Sigil for the opportunity to colonize a new frontier.




In the following century, the people of Mars regarded themselves as nothing but laborers; they built the Mondshire station on Earth’s moon for forty years. Neo Hampshire and St. Niliam Colonies soon followed, constructed successfully at the Lagrange points taking around thirty years each.
Sigil Corporation promised them a good life for the completion of each colony project they’ve built, but the humans in Mars noticed that only a few among themselves were given privileges and the colonies turned out to be mostly for the use of Terran immigrants.



In the year 2396, the people of Mars formed a confederation of traders and workers and called themselves as the Ares Confederacy. The people of Mars, being mostly comprised of laborers and engineers, equipped with state-of-the-art mass production equipment on the red planet, decreed full militarization and production of mankind’s finest space warfare assets, some of which were rumored to be gargantuan dreadnaughts, in the hope of proclaiming and preserving their independence from Terran governance.
In February 2406, the present year, the Ares propaganda has spread throughout the Terran stations. The Terran colonists began to realize the harsh conditions the Confederates were forced into and became sympathizers. Ares cells began infiltrating Terran colonies and encouraged the spread of anti-Terran ideology all boosted by the popularity of Ares’ charismatic leaders; soon, dissent rose as the public perception of Terran governance fell.



Months later, the Confederacy mounted take-and-hold operations as well as acts of subterfuge to undermine Terra’s hold over Mars. Their plans were successful; the Terrans were caught off guard. The Confederacy took control of the Lagrange colonies, the Moonbase, and Earth’s orbital space. The orbital blockade created an absolute embargo for all space trade for Earth.
While the Confederacy meant no harm to civilians, they were ultimately and effectively no more than prisoners of war. The United Terran Vanguard (UTV), the standing space navy of the Earth Alliance, now mobilizes its assets around Earth’s orbital space to form the very last line of defense.



While Ares stood to uphold continued aggression against Terra, Sigil’s attempts to defuse the situation in a peaceful manner failed. In an act of desperation, Sigil would invest its resources to strengthen the UTV Fleet and commission the experimental battleship “Sierra” into the frontlines.
Lieutenant Commander Junius Fahrenheit, along with Ensign Claine de Lune and Major Jean Brookes were all tasked to reclaim the stations back under Terran control. This campaign, spearheaded by these young officers and the new battleship Sierra, came to be known as…

Help make the final push happen, and be part of Sierra Ops's history:
We have been working on the game for the last eleven months, and we're now pushing for the final goal - which is to finish all the story mode elements: set up all the events in game, design the stages and balance their difficulty, and finally add the remaining functionalities in the engine like the inventory system, overworld commands and fleet setup (or ""Party Members"", if you will).
Sierra's weapons will be fully customizable. It is similar to crafting in most games, here are a few examples:
1. The missiles' thrusters, explosive type, and armor type can be altered, making its speed/damage/reload time suitable to the players' needs. 
2. Kinetic cannons' barrels, cannon type and recoil force balancer can be altered, adjusting its power and reload time.
By supporting us, we offer perks which allow you to have your character in our game. You could be part of the Ares Confederacy Enemy Officials, or a United Terran Vanguard Soldier who could be potentially an obtainable unit or even become a pirate ship that the Sierra may encounter as an obstacle.
UPDATED: You can view all the backer portraits here.

Risk and Challenges:
""It is hard to complete a game, we have been there, done that.""

We have one finished game, and that is Operation SD: Space Defense  www.desura.com/games/operation-sd-space-defense , it took about a year to finish and not all members were able to give full dedication to the project; We were very slow as we have our own priorities and hobbies, and some simply didn't liked the Sci-Fi genre.
After completing Operation SD: Space Defense together with several heated debates/ arguments/ tears/ sweat/ beers, we were very happy by the end. But the game didn't really did well to the public as it has a lot of flaws. It was frustrating, we failed to sell the game higher than 200 units, making our revenue for the whole year 2012 and 2013 just around 400$-ish and did not even made it to the distributor's 500$ monthly cut.
After a few months, we decided to create Sierra Ops - an idealization of Operation SD: Space Defense. At first, we were really skeptical and wanted to jump straight to real-time strategy instead. But Jason decided to rebuild Operation SD instead to its ""ideal"" form and the main inspiration was gtd-carthage's redesign of the Sierra. 
Since we knew how the original game works, we just had to add more depth to it such as including consequence based storyline development, the overworld system, as well as the further customizations to Sierra's parts and weapons - It was a very straightforward development.
Along the way, we have met a lot of professional voice actors/actresses who are very supportive to the indie scene. We have learned a lot in this project, and everyone really did their best to step up their game for Sierra Ops compared to how OSD was being made.
The biggest risk is that, if we can't reach the funding goal, a few members of the team might need to work on a full time job and we have to cut down the features that should be in game just for the sake of releasing it earlier.
In addition, any unforeseen circumstances may happen, this is life after all, but we do think we are capable of completing Sierra Ops, and make it one of the memorable games of the decade. 
We are developers inspired by various titles from Eastern and Western games/novels such as Muv Luv Alternative, Gundam series, Mass Effect, Master of Orion, Freespace, GSB and many other non Sci-Fi novels from Type Moon, R07, Minori and more. 
We are also a team of aspiring directors since we were young (we're 25+ now) - we have been joining at several video making contests and we basically know how to execute something, no matter how cliche it is very well. You may take the story trailer as our primary example.

The challenge we expect from making Sierra Ops is that, since we're stepping up our methods of development, everyone has to get used to the following:
1. New software, such as the Unity game engine and its extensions we've bought recently, because OSD was created from XNA alone and was not Mac/Linux compatible.
2. As for the creative department, the composer has to do advanced mixing of the music, and the CG artists must be capable of delivering a polished style consistently and should appeal the mainstream audience. All of our content are original and we did not took assets from royalty free aside from the planet textures (that were modified severely anyway).
We are not asking for your support to start the game development, but we are requesting your aid to make the game a lot better to play with the added features. 
Every amount we receive from you will help us release the game faster and will make the game a lot more possible to be released this year with the desired and expanded features. And what we'll do in return, is that you will be part of the game's history as a ship Captain or executive, and have your profile written at the lexicon entries.

Publishing agreements can often come with pressure to change the creative direction of the game or to implement more predatory revenue models such as loot boxes or pay-to-win microtransactions.</p><p><strong>Whether or not </strong>Path of Titans meets our crowdfunding goal, the game <strong>will be released at some point in the future. </strong>We will be self-funding the project with $36 000 AUD (Approx. $25 200 USD) in order to ensure work on the game can continue. This money will go towards paying for rent, electricity, development server costs, and generally allowing us to sustain our work environment for the core development team. We are committed to bringing this game to life and won’t stop until it’s been completed. However, <strong>without the money raised through crowdfunding the release date of the game will have to be pushed further back,</strong> as our team members will have to work part-time on the project in order to make their own ends meet.</p><p>Everything raised during our crowdfunding campaign will be put directly towards further development of Path of Titans. The exact place these funds will go towards are outlined below.</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Indiegogo Platform Fees - $1800 AUD (Approx. $1250 USD)</strong><br/>Indiegogo takes a flat 5% for all funds raised, which amounts to $1 800 AUD.</li>
<li>
<strong>Processing Fees - $1080 AUD (Approx. $750 USD)</strong><br/>Payment processing and currency conversion will take about 3% of all funds raised, which will amount to approximately $1 080 AUD.</li>
<li>
<strong>Taxes - $9940</strong> <strong>AUD (Approx. $6980 USD)</strong><br/>Australian law requires 30% tax paid on all funds earned after processing fees and platform fees, which amounts to approximately $9 940 AUD.</li>
<li>
<strong>2D Art and Texture Work - $7100 AUD (Approx. $5000 USD)</strong><br/>The very high amount of 2D and Texture work needed will require outsourcing to our freelance artists in order to meet our targeted release date.</li>
<li>
<strong>Development Kits and Tools - $5700 AUD (Approx. $4000 USD)</strong><br/>Developing for consoles and specific devices require expensive development kits and development tools that we currently cannot afford on our own. This will go directly towards paying for these and for any platform-related fees.</li>
<li>
<strong>Backend Development - $7100 AUD (Approx. $5000 USD)</strong><br/>These funds will go towards further developing our distribution methods, launcher, game patching tools, mod deployment backend, and modding tools.</li>
<li>
<strong>Bandwidth and Download Costs - $3300 AUD (Approx. $2300 USD)</strong><br/>Because we are hosting our own servers and distribution platform we will have to bear all the costs of distribution. This means all game downloads, mod downloads and server fees will have to be paid for, and this is what these funds will go towards.</li>
</ul><p> </p><h3>Stretch Goals</h3><p>If we manage to meet our crowdfunding goal, all further money raised will be put towards our stretch goals. These goals represent content, features, mechanics, and game modes that we believe are strong additions to Path of Titans but are currently not within the scope of our budget.

Path of Titans will feature an extensive environment you must survive in. Find water, forage for edible plants, and hunt prey in order to avoid death. But that’s just the beginning. Partake in realistic, environment driven quests in order to gain points to put towards improving your character and permanently unlocking skins or new dinosaurs.
Path of Titans will be packed with features to allow for plenty of replayability and content for hundreds of hours of play time. Some of the main features include:

Permanent characters with in-depth skin and trait customization
A complex questing system.
Group and Guild systems that allow for pack hunting and herd migration, with servers supporting up to 200 concurrent players.
Lush environment filled with AI dinosaurs and smaller prehistoric creatures
Swimming, diving, and fishing in both lakes and rivers.
Cross platform functionality, play the game from your PC with your friends on mobile and vice versa.
Powerful modding tools with extensive documentation, and a backend allowing modders to deliver their content to other players.

 
Game Mechanic Videos



 


The dinosaurs you will find in Path of Titans have been selected for variety in aesthetics, physical traits, and playstyles. From the small Camptosaurus to the giant Daspletosaurus, a wide variety of playstyles will be available. All our dinosaurs aim for scientific accuracy, with feathered species and semi-aquatic species being fully present in-game.
Our 10 dinosaurs have been selected from two time periods and geological formations: the Morrison Formation from the Jurassic Period, and the Dinosaur Park Formation from the Cretaceous Period. In the future we plan on adding dinosaurs from the Elrhaz Formation, with one dinosaur already in-game.




 


Community is important to any game, and the Path of Titans team recognizes the amount of passion and talent dinosaur enthusiasts have. Powerful modding tools will be a staple in Path of Titans and will always be free for anyone to download and use. With extensive documentation and help to guide modders, anyone can download the dev kit and begin creating.Our already developed mod deployment backend will allow modders to upload their content directly to our servers to be automatically patched with each new update. Dozens of mods have already been created by members of our community. A few are listed below!Supported PlatformsPath of Titans will be available for multiple platforms complete with cross-platform play, with a future ideal goal to bring it to consoles at a later date. Path of Titans will be distributed through our own Alderon Games launcher, from which you will be able to download mods, patches, and engage with the community. This game will not be available through Steam.
Windows (7, 8.1, and 10)
MacOS (Mojave and later)
Linux (Tested on Ubuntu / Debian Based OS)
Android (Must support Vulkan)
iOS (iOS12 and higher, and iPhone 6S or higher)
For server owners:Windows, Linux, and Mac based servers will be compatible with Path of Titans. Listen servers can also be hosted on all supported platforms.Our LauncherPath of Titans will be downloadable and playable through our launcher. Through our launcher you will be able to easily keep up to date with news, updates, and patches. For more information please check out our blog post here. If you would like to download our launcher for free, please visit https://alderongames.com and create an account. Once you log in, you will be able to download our launcher and install it on your device. While you cannot yet play the game, you can still check out news and information about the game through the launcher!Supported LanguagesWe recognize that dinosaur enthusiasts come from around the world, so we plan to support 27 different languages from all corners of the globe. All supported languages are listed below. Budget BreakdownBy utilizing crowdfunding we will be able to remain independent and develop the game as we and the community see fit instead of having to partner with a publisher. Publishing agreements can often come with pressure to change the creative direction of the game or to implement more predatory revenue models such as loot boxes or pay-to-win microtransactions.Whether or not Path of Titans meets our crowdfunding goal, the game will be released at some point in the future. We will be self-funding the project with $36 000 AUD (Approx. $25 200 USD) in order to ensure work on the game can continue. This money will go towards paying for rent, electricity, development server costs, and generally allowing us to sustain our work environment for the core development team. We are committed to bringing this game to life and won’t stop until it’s been completed. However, without the money raised through crowdfunding the release date of the game will have to be pushed further back, as our team members will have to work part-time on the project in order to make their own ends meet.Everything raised during our crowdfunding campaign will be put directly towards further development of Path of Titans. The exact place these funds will go towards are outlined below.

Indiegogo Platform Fees - $1800 AUD (Approx. $1250 USD)Indiegogo takes a flat 5% for all funds raised, which amounts to $1 800 AUD.

Processing Fees - $1080 AUD (Approx. $750 USD)Payment processing and currency conversion will take about 3% of all funds raised, which will amount to approximately $1 080 AUD.

Taxes - $9940 AUD (Approx. $6980 USD)Australian law requires 30% tax paid on all funds earned after processing fees and platform fees, which amounts to approximately $9 940 AUD.

2D Art and Texture Work - $7100 AUD (Approx. $5000 USD)The very high amount of 2D and Texture work needed will require outsourcing to our freelance artists in order to meet our targeted release date.

Development Kits and Tools - $5700 AUD (Approx. $4000 USD)Developing for consoles and specific devices require expensive development kits and development tools that we currently cannot afford on our own. This will go directly towards paying for these and for any platform-related fees.

Backend Development - $7100 AUD (Approx. $5000 USD)These funds will go towards further developing our distribution methods, launcher, game patching tools, mod deployment backend, and modding tools.

Bandwidth and Download Costs - $3300 AUD (Approx. $2300 USD)Because we are hosting our own servers and distribution platform we will have to bear all the costs of distribution. This means all game downloads, mod downloads and server fees will have to be paid for, and this is what these funds will go towards.
 Stretch GoalsIf we manage to meet our crowdfunding goal, all further money raised will be put towards our stretch goals. These goals represent content, features, mechanics, and game modes that we believe are strong additions to Path of Titans but are currently not within the scope of our budget. Help us get there faster by backing today! All stretch goals will be added after the release of the initial base game and will be available to all players at no additional cost.As more money is raised, the next tiers will be revealed! Check back and see what new goals become unlocked as crowdfunding continues.Play the Game EarlyAs a reward for backing at our Pre-release Access tier, backers will have access to the game during a specified Pre-Release window.

Pre-Release Access will be for PC only (Windows, Linux, and Mac)As a Pre-Release version of the game, it will not be fully feature complete and may contains bugs or other problems that could hinder gameplay.

<p>Dead Matter was conceived and developed, from the beginning, by friends and singleplayer enthusiasts alike. We plan to support and encourage both playstyles as often as we can and wherever we can.</p>
<p>Whether you want to join a huge dedicated server and explore a bustling community of players and build your list of friends and enemies, or invite some friends and try to take on post-apocalyptic Alberta in privacy - it's up to you. You won't have to worry about any port forwarding, just invite a friend on Steam and Dead Matter will take care of the rest.</p>

</div></div>","""What would I do in a zombie apocalypse?""It's a question you've probably asked yourself, and it's a question we want to help you answer.Dead Matter is a community driven, crowd funded survival game that aims to quench the thirst for a true zombie survival sandbox. Initially funded in August of 2017. We aim to bring the game to Steam Early Access shortly after our closed testing period.Dead Matter caters to a multitude of survival playstyles that can be mixed and matched, affording players an infinite amount of ways to survive in post apocalyptic Alberta.We've been hard at work over the past 9 months to bring Dead Matter to life. After many hardships the foundation has been laid and we're now working on fleshing out key content. We always listen to feedback that our fans give us and truly appreciate all of the support we've been shown thus far.CUSTOMISE YOUR LOOK
The way you like it.In Dead Matter, the only limits on your player is you. Freedom of expression is an important design philosophy for us and as such, we've planned out our customisation systems from the beginning to give you as much power over your protagonist as you want. From hair, to head, to body, you'll be in control. The world of Dead Matter is filled with every manner of weapon you could think of, and we've built them from the ground up to support all kinds of customisation, allowing you to tune the weapon to your playstyle. Whether you want to wrap your baseball bat in barbed wire and go out bashing, rig an alarm clock with C4 to go off with a bang, or strap up your gun with a makeshift kitchen knife bayonet, the choice is yours.You can also use scraps such as old lawnmowers, fire extinguishers, pressure washers, and more to put together weapons, ensuring your survival no matter the situation.All of those rails will be used to hold a wide variety of attachments designed to aid your survival.It doesn't stop with the weapons. Our vehicles were broken down and designed in parts to allow you to transform any run-of-the-mill suburban family van into an apocalypse-kitted survivalist's dream. All it takes is the right ambition and desire to leave your mark on the world (and the right materials, of course).You can also turn your vehicle into a mobile fortress, or have a truck configured to tow a few thousand litres of fuel, water or even tow a wrecked vehicle. It's up to you. 


 
MULTIPLAYER
Hell on Earth. Better with friends.
Dead Matter was conceived and developed, from the beginning, by friends and singleplayer enthusiasts alike. We plan to support and encourage both playstyles as often as we can and wherever we can.
Whether you want to join a huge dedicated server and explore a bustling community of players and build your list of friends and enemies, or invite some friends and try to take on post-apocalyptic Alberta in privacy - it's up to you. You won't have to worry about any port forwarding, just invite a friend on Steam and Dead Matter will take care of the rest.


 
OUR WORLD20x20km of beautiful Canadian landscape.We've crafted our depiction of Alberta to be the ultimate survival sandbox; lush with variety and life, from the wild forests and lakes of the Rockies, to the once bustling city of Calgary. To effectively simulate a breathing world, we've built our metagame and AI systems to support true variety. Expect the unexpected: any forest trek, highway cruise, or grocery store trip could lead you on crossed paths with a settlement of soldiers, a band of scavengers, or simple families searching for shelter, all of which will do whatever it takes to ensure their own survival.But the AI don't get to have all the fun. The world of Dead Matter was developed to support your settlements. Any building you see can be barricaded, upgraded, and fitted with electricity and flowing water. The land can be farmed and cultivated, and the lakes fished. You can live quietly, in the shadows of day-to-day post-apocalyptic life, or settle your people around Alberta's transformers, dams, and bridges, to retake control of the world around you.



IMMERSIVE INVENTORY
Minimal HUD elements. Maximum attention to detail.Dead Matter utilises a grid-based, jigsaw-style inventory system that challenges you to plan and conserve. Just as they are in the real world, items are host to a variety of unique variables beyond size and quantity, like temperature and quality. What you scavenge will often require unique planning and storage, so be conscious. 
Our items are designed to behave realistically. You'll have to unbox your ammo and pack your magazines, open cans of food with various tools that can be found in the world - or simply smash it on the ground if nothing else is available.We don't want scavenging to feel restrictive in Dead Matter. Any container you find can be physically opened and looted, from a nightstand, to a vending machine, to a locked-up gun safe. You can search the home for the key or force it open and play your luck - just don't make too much noise. Your character physically reaches out to pick up items, flick light switches, push buttons, open doors, open containers, and much more. Nothing in Dead Matter happens instantly, and items don't teleport off the ground into your inventory. You are a part of the world and must interact with it.RESOURCESEssential to living.Electricity is a core part of modern life, and the beginning of the zombie apocalypse will reflect that. Our robust electrical system enables you to fully power your home, opening up many gameplay options from the typical minutia of turning lights on and off, to permitting the usage of power tools to enhance your crafting and upgrades. Nothing this good lasts forever, however, and bad luck and poor planning could leave you with dead equipment when things go south.We also have a robust sewer system to go alongside our water system, you'll occasionally be required to head into a dark, cramped and terrifying environment in order to secure a steady supply of water for the survivors at your settlement or for survivors willing to trade some supplies for a little bit of your time.Once you have a stable source of water, you can hunt, forage or scavenge for food in order to feed yourself and those that rely on you. Keep in mind that every gunshot near a town will draw the undead closer to your location. MODDING SUPPORTBack to our roots.
 Player freedom is an incredibly important aspect of a fun survival game, and as such we're putting everything in your hands - our procedural development tools (which support full polish control for our environment artists), C++ and blueprint access, everything. We're modders at our core, and we know how important modding support is for a healthy, long lasting community. Any user can host their own server, with their own settings and mods - on or off the Steam Workshop. It's all accessible and it's all free.Epic Games has offered to help us bring modding to Dead Matter via the Unreal Launcher, and we plan to take them up on this once we know the game is ready. We plan to support modding via Steam Workshop to ensure ease of use for everyday players and for server owners.   
OUR COMMUNITY
Essential to our success!Dead Matter is a community driven title. Our development staff is extremely active on the community Discord, and we often give our backers sneak peaks, as well as take suggestions. One of the most complex systems in the game was initially a fan suggestion that ended up becoming the vehicle towing system.Want to join our discord server? Simply click here: discord.gg/deadmatterWe also take suggestions and engage with our community via our forum, which you can check out here: playdeadmatter.com/forumsWe'll also be opening our influencer program in the near future, allowing content creators and other cool folks to help spread the word around about Dead Matter!  STRETCH GOAL PROGRESS​We love progress!Since our Kickstarter we've been working hard on not only the base game but the stretch goals for Dead Matter. Even though we're still in pre-alpha, we've already put a dent into our stretch goals and we plan on bringing them to our supporters as fast as humanly possible.
MAP EXPANSION""Our depiction of Alberta is already huge. However, we still have some unused space to fill, including underground. Hitting the required amount for this stretch goal means that we will be able to add in new locations to the map, such as an abandoned underground mining complex. We will also include new weapons and new items to compliment the locations that we add in.""The code for the map expansion has been written and our world will now feature abandoned bunkers strewn across it. This stretch goal is complete.Required Amount: $70,000 CAD - REACHED PLANES & TRAINS""While the base game will be bustling with cars, trucks, boats, and bicycles, giving you the tools to conquer the skies and the rails will require more. Hitting our goal with this means that Dead Matter will receive helicopters, fixed wing aircraft, and trains for you to fortify, upgrade, and defend from those who want them for themselves. To store your new machines, we'll also be fleshing out the train stations, heliports, and airports throughout the map. New unique weapons, vehicles, and clothing will be there for you to find and claim.""Planes and Helicopters are still in progress. Trains are receiving a polish pass before we post them publicly, but are currently functional in game. This stretch goal is underway.Required Amount: $85,000 CAD - REACHED WAY BACK WEST""A new sandbox inspired by Vancouver Island and the original Dead Matter mod's map. Smaller and denser, Vancouver Island is home to new weapons, new enemies, new vehicles, new clothes, and new places to explore, all on a coastal landscape that will change the terms of survival.You'll also be able to travel between Alberta and Vancouver Island at your leisure, assuming you've got the supplies for it.""This stretch goal is still in early development and will be completed after the initial Dead Matter release on Steam. This stretch goal has not been started.Required Amount: $120,000 CAD - REACHED INTERACTIVE AI SETTLEMENTS & FACTIONS""Work with - or against - your fellow man. Trade with, run errands for, and earn favour with the inhabitants of the world to determine the outcome of new communities of families and strangers.Or expand your own: invite your new friends and followers to join your homes. Organize scavenging runs, delegate jobs and roles, and work to keep each other alive.""This is our favourite stretch goal. We'll be revealing more information on player and AI settlements shortly. This stretch goal is nearly complete. Required Amount: $175,000 CAD - REACHED RADIO & RADIO STATIONS""The final word of stations of the past, classical tunes, emergency broadcasts, and hijacked airwaves will be yours to hear, control, and follow. Play with new vehicles like OB vans, contact your friends with new tools like pocket and HAM radios, and explore and conquer the old radio stations at your leisure.""We've created the art related to the radios but not the stations. The code we'll be using for VoIP has been partially implemented, and NPC Radio Hosts have been organised and are present in the teaser trailer along with a functional radio entity. This stretch goal is underway.Required Amount: $200,000 CAD - REACHED MODULAR GEAR, NEW WEAPONS, AND ENHANCED TWITCH SUPPORT""Upon reaching this tier, we’ll be able to fully flesh out our modular suit system. Scavenge and scrap the remnants of the apocalypse and fit your player with a set of gear that can be worn atop most of the clothing in the game. We’ll also be adding fifteen new melee weapons and five new firearms.  We’ll also be including official Twitch support. In addition to our already planned ‘Broadcast Mode’, which disguises your player name and the server you’re connected to, this goal will allow us to expand our integration further: view your chat in-game, poll your viewers, invite them to participate and easily add connected viewers to your party.""All of our weapons have been remade from scratch. We've added over 15 new firearms and over 5 new melee weapons (on top of the 40+ melee weapons we had pre-kickstarter).  This half of the stretch goal is considered complete. Streamer mode is currently implemented however an official Twitch integration is still underway. The additional gear is currently in the planning phases. This half of the stretch goal is still underway.Required Amount: $225,000 CAD - REACHED PLAYER-MADE STRUCTURES""Construct, upgrade, and expand your control of the world. We’ll be overhauling our player settlement system to support greater constructive capabilities, allowing you to assemble seamless, personalized shelters from shacks, to shanties, to cabins, to garages that serve whatever purpose you’ll give them. Like all else in the game, our game options will allow server hosts or singleplayer explorers to adjust and fine-tune every aspect of these player structures, from changing the material requirements to outright disabling them.""Player-made structures have been integrated into the player settlement system, and we'll be revealing more information on this very soon. This stretch goal is nearly complete.Required Amount: $275,000 CAD - REACHED Enhanced Character Customization""Reaching this stretch goal will enable us to implement custom morph targets that will expand our character customisation options. In addition to modifying your player's eye colour, hair colour, and head type, morph targets will allow you to completely retool your player's face.  
Hitting this stretch goal will also allow server owners to enable dynamic progression for your character's appearance: hair growth, scarring, and ageing and more, all of which can be adjusted via server settings. We will also be adding makeup, razors, and similar cosmetic items to let you change your look on the fly.""
Even though we haven't received the funds we needed for this goal, we've started work on it with some of the best the industry has to offer. We'll be posting some pictures of the progress here as soon as possible. This stretch goal is underway!
Required Amount: $325,000 CAD - NOT REACHED

Help us keep our project growing! We're gamers with a purpose. We're alarmed at the rising rates of anxiety and depression we've seen nationally, especially in our youth. We know that there are scientifically validated self-care practices that can help, but we also know how hard it is to maintain new habits and routines. That's why we're combining the best features of mobile games and wellness apps into Amaru: The Self-Care Virtual Pet, a game designed specifically to help support players in developing habits of self-care.Even though we're tackling a serious topic, we wanted to tackle it with fun, beauty, and lightness. This is our opportunity to use the video game medium for serious real-world impact. Thanks for checking us out and backing our project!When the mysterious Fog of Maya descends, it plunges the world of Enso into chaos. Amaru is lost, anxious, and far from his home.  Far across the cosmos, a human Seeker is searching for hope and meaning.  A helpful guide named Kamali senses a tie in the fates of these two creatures and creates a portal for the Seeker to enter the world of Enso.  The game begins when the Seeker and Amaru meet.  A fated friendship is about to be born!*your day may look different depending on your selected goals.This game is different from many you may have encountered.  Players will customize their self-care goals and are encouraged to play the game for 15-30 minutes each day. Players who play daily can expect to clear the main game content in roughly 2 months, the amount of time it takes for new habits to become routine. Think of it as Neopets meets Headspace: a place where you check in with your pet while checking in with yourself! Your very own virtual pet!

Explore an open ocean full of places to travel and people to meet and trade with.Set in a tropical ocean, Summer in Mara is a single-player game about farming and crafting, with an easy-RPG system and exploration elements. You'll be Koa, a little adventurer who has to take care of her own island.You can also sail away on your boat and discover new different islands. With new islands come new people. You will trade and bargain or just chat with them. Getting to know these people is a significant part of the game because every one of them has their own unique and exciting story.Afterward, you can go back to your island and manage your resources to improve your home, grow new crops and create new structures.This is the circle of life: take care of your home island, travel through the ocean to get new items and help others, and then come back to your home.    Summer in Mara is a calm and relaxing experience with a handmade look and a compelling narrative.
More than 150 quests to make the world a better place.    
Over 20 characters to meet and trade with. Befriend them!

We have been developing a game that not only feels great but is also a ton of fun.

You will be fishing, swimming, and diving in the ocean. With your boat, you can sail through the sea, discover new islands and seek for treasures.Take care of your island. Explore the ocean. Improve your home. Sail away.The game is inspired by the exploration in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, the farming in Stardew Valley, the visual aspect of Studio Ghibli’s movies and the adventure feeling of your childhood summers. It’s also part of the Deiland universe, although it is an independent and unique adventure with its own story. We will release the game on PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Windows and MacOS in Steam.  
The game will be in English, Spanish, German, French, Dutch, Japanese, Valencian and Galician when it is released.We would love to have the game in all the languages possible, but we're going to need  50 backers to translate the game to Russian, Japanese, and Chinese to translate the game into these languages. So, share this campaign with a friend and help us to reach this goal! If you want Summer in Mara in another language, leave us a comment and we'll see if we can make it possible. On the planet Qü, Mara is the ocean that brings life to our islands and our lives. You’re Koa, a little adventurer who has to take care of her home island. She has never seen the outside world beyond this island, but the ocean has always called her. Koa has always lived with her grandma, Yaya Haku, a very strict old qüido. Yaya Haku allows Koa to go wherever she wants on the island. But there is a big door on a cliff and Koa can't touch or do anything to it. Surrounded in mystery, this door keeps a secret that only Yaya Haku knows about.Now, Mara ocean is in danger. An evil corporation from another planet has arrived at planet Qü, attracted by a strange energy that emerges from the sea. They're the Elit and they want to conquer and exploit Mara's resources. Mara is an ocean full of life, with a lot of exciting things to do and see. Don't miss the city island or the pirates racing through the sea and take very good care when you reach to the Storm Belt in the south. That's just a few of the things that you can find in the Mara ocean. Home IslandYour island. It has a beautiful beach, an enormous mountain, and a strange door. This is the place where Koa grew up and the only home that she knows. Taking care of an entire island is a lot of work, but Koa likes it.  However, she wants to venture outside and discover new places.City Island A lot of different qüidos and humans (even an elit!) live on this island. They have their business, such as the fish market, the restaurant, the bank, and the forge. On the edge of the cliff, there is a lighthouse where a strange and lonely shadow lives. 
Desert Island It seems like an empty island, but you will have to look closer. The most relevant thing in this place is a hive of strange creatures. If somebody lives here, it might be because they don't want to be found. Small Islands All across Mara are little islands scattered about. You can find treasures, new items, and mythical creatures on these small islands. 
KoaThe main protagonist of Summer in Mara, Koa is a little adventurer who wants to explore the world, but she can’t leave her home island. She's always barefoot and has a name for every seagull on the island.Yaya Haku Yaya Haku takes care of Koa and their island, but she’s old, and she can’t do all the things that she used to do. She’s very strict with Koa because she thinks that discipline is essential for surviving. Yaya Haku has a fantastic past, but few people know about it.Napopo Napopo, like all of the creatures of her race, cares very much for the other species that live in the ocean. Also, she can feel if someone is pure at heart or a dangerous person. They’re not fighters, but they won’t let evil prevail, and they will do everything they can to fight it. Other Characters There’re a lot of qüidos, humans and other species living in Mara. Almost everyone is friendly and all of them need a little help.                                                                                            There aren't factions in Mara, just different lifestyles. For example, the Qüido are the principal inhabitants of the planet. They always help one another and don't have a ruler or a leader. At sea, you can find the Qü Navy, guardians and explorers of Mara, and the Pirates, people who only trust themselves. Recently, the Elit, a corporation from another planet, appeared on Qü. The Qüido are a strange race, but they're pretty calm. They are fishers, merchants, cooks, explorers… They can live for 200 years, and there are stories about 500 years-old Qüido. Also, they can change their color under certain circumstances.The Qü Navy is an old institution where the boldest and the brightest are trained to guard and explore Qü, the planet of the Qüido. Their primary objective is to protect the peace in the ocean and help others.In Mara, the pirates tend to race a lot for ridiculous prizes and fight each other for no reason. They’re always running away from the Navy and even have their own island too. Among these fierce pirates, you can find Ereti, the fastest pirate in Mara, Mr. Ecco, an old and not-so-trustworthy man, Litio, the lawful evil outlaw, or Rigatta, the Elit pirate.  An evil corporation from another planet. They travel from one world to another, exploiting their resources and destroying them. The Elit need the dadiva fruit to survive, and that’s why their skin is purple. We want to give you the most beautiful and summer-like game possible. These are just a sample of our work, with character designs, concepts, illustrations and background pictures that you will see in the final product. We start with 2D concepts of all the characters and buildings. From them, we work to get a 3D model that feels similar to the first idea. In the case of the characters, after the 3D model, we made the animation, trying to convey the personality traits that every character has in particular. Paco Mitos, our musician from Deiland and the previous Chibig projects, is back for Summer in Mara, this time with a tropical feeling in his instrumental themes.         We also have Adrián Berenguer with us. He made the song that you can hear in the trailer. He also has other surprises for you.   Check the sheet music for Marinera by Adrián Berenguer. As a sound designer, we have Jaime Almenar, who worked with us to make a fantastic atmosphere and bring life to all the creatures in Mara. The animation that you saw in the trailer was made by Ciervo Alto, with a little help from our artists. We think it helps to convey the universe of the game, expanding through different media the story of Koa and Mara ocean.     
 With your help we can create even more amazing 2D cinematics, working with our Ciervo Alto friends. We would love to make a cinematic opening and ending for the game, but it would only be possible if we reach certain stretch goals.   We have limited tiers with special rewards, so stay tuned to our Indiegogo page because you never know what surprises could be!Chibig Studio has been making games since 2016.

<p>Rome has sought to conquer Caledonia for as long as your people can recall. Only fierce resistance drove the Romans back behind the great wall marking the boundary of their empire. There Rome is watching and waiting for an opportunity to strike.</p>
<p>But walls do not bring peace, and the scars of war run deep. Trouble stirs at Dunadd, the seat of power of your people, as Morrigan, a vengeful queen, rises to power.</p>
<p>You may be young, but you have seen enough of war for a lifetime. Will you unite the tribes and bring an end to strife, or will you channel their rage and crush Rome once for all?</p>

<p>Sacred Fire’s tactical combat revolves around your character’s inner strength. It blends storytelling and tactics while testing your character’s ingenuity and integrity.</p>
<p>Your emotions are your weapon and your weakness. Anger adds strength to your attacks, but makes them less accurate and can leave your defense open. And just as your enemies’ fear can weaken their resolve, it can erode your strength as well.</p>
<p>Diplomacy can end a conflict without bloodshed. Winning the respect or instilling fear in your enemies can serve you better than littering the battlefield with corpses.</p>

<p>You will need allies to survive, but relationships are a double-edged sword. The challenge is to read the motivation of others and learn to overcome your own base instincts.</p>
<p>Sacred Fire features 10 major story characters. Each represents an ultimate psychological challenge such as overcoming guilt, resisting envy or winning trust.</p>
<p>Each relationship has a breaking point, a moment where it is tested. It remains strong or fails, based on your choices. Will you be prepared?</p>

Our backers love the text-based preview of Sacred Fire’s first chapter:
“The story was very engrossing! Even at this level I was totally enthralled and immersed. Cannot wait for more.”
“I’m proud to be a backer for Sacred Fire and spent several evenings poking through every line of your text-based chapter. I enjoyed it thoroughly and I’m looking forward to the game even more.“
“It was amazing. I loved the ability to analyze the situation or trying to understand where a character was coming from. These kinds of context clues make it so much more immersive. The decisions felt like they had weight. Thank you for being able to establish a great character relationship and background.”

 Big Head Games & Jelle's MarblesBig Head Games have been making games for donkey's years, starting out individually in game studios working on titles as diverse as Pokemon, Hannah Montana, Tony Hawks, Batman, Sky Sports Football Manager, Lemmings, Colin McRae Rally and many more.Forming Big Head Games at the start of the iPhone era and making games for other people including Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 for EA, Grease (yes the movie) for 505 Games as well as our own games with the massively successful snooker sim International Snooker and Pool classic Doodle Pool. Most people reading this will already know about Jelle but for those who don't, Jelle's been making YouTube videos of marble machines and marble runs since he could hold a camera, his YouTube channel is now huge with 1.34m subscribers and has been featured in media around the world including on Sky and HBO's John Oliver's Last Week Tonight show as well as ESPN and numerous pieces on news channels.Known as the Marble Master his creations have made an impact in every corner of the world.  https://www.youtube.com/c/JellesMarbleRuns  The development processWe are currently at what is known as first playable. That is a version of the game you can play that represents how the game will look and play, calling out key parts. Rough and ready it forms the basis of the game as a whole. Next up we work towards second playable in August and Alpha in September - it's this build that will be uploaded to Steam and early backers will get access to, it'll not be perfect, it'll still be in development and it'll give you a chance to comment and feedback your thoughts to the developers. Together we take this game to Beta, a complete game just needing translations and bug fixes. This is timed for October.Once we have a clean build we'll start on more content, currently we think we'll be adding winter events next. Risks and challengesWe feel there are very few risks, as we are already a long way on with development and have developed many games previously. So we feel the game will be completed and on time. We've kept the perk rewards simple so we know we can fulfil them.",1.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>It's dangerous to go outside alone!</h3>
<p>After three incredible campaigns, it's time to return for our fourth issue of Ninty Fresh Magazine and our second of 2021. This one is of course all about The Legend of Zelda. Well, the iconic franchise is 35 years old this year!</p>
<p>With more than 20 adventures coming in all shapes and sizes - not to mention contentious art styles - this legendary franchise is so deep and engaging that we do our best to cover everything in 25 odd pages! We also have this absolutely incredible cover artwork by the amazing artist, Phil Summers. You may remember him from not only our second issue but also his hand-drawn manual series. It's truly special and it looks amazing on our cover!</p>

<h3>What is Ninty Fresh Magazine?</h3>
<p>We are three issues in now, but if this is your first time finding us then we will explain a little bit about ourselves again. Until we launched, there had not been any Nintendo magazines in the UK since ONM closed in 2014. With the recent demise of corporate multi-format publications in general (like GamesMaster and GamesTM) there's a huge lack of Nintendo coverage in print form. Whilst there are enthusiast ventures available, we craved something that completely covered and encompassed Nintendo's vast history. Something that looks at the retro aspect as well as the new, with a fresh perspective on things. So, we thought we would make one: Ninty Fresh. Something that will cater for ALL of Nintendo. From NES to Now. Or, in this case, Virtual Boy to Now - we have a Virtual Boy Retrospective in the pages of the next issue!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621080851/tg34ppmoflbwbctdiugy.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our title, Ninty Fresh, captures exactly what the magazine is about with the added benefit of a cheeky pun. Imagine, if you will, a cross between EMAP's Nintendo Official Magazine, Future's Official Nintendo Magazine and a dash of Retro Gamer and NGamer and that's what we hope to bring to the party, all with that Nintendo flavour and familiarity that older magazines brought you. But in 2021. And obviously, with no affiliation to those amazing magazines. Making your own magazine without advertising support or huge corporate backing is challenging, but since our first three issues went down so well, we came back. The fourth issue of Ninty Fresh is going to be another A4 (210mmx297mm) page turner with a smorgasbord of Nintendo content crammed into 84 pages. And no adverts.</p>

<h3>What will be in Ninty Fresh issue 4?</h3>
<p>Just like our previous issues, our Ninty Fresh magazines are themed and this one is dedicated to The Legend of Zelda, with 35 years of celebration covered. But that's not all you will find inside! </p>
<p>We plan to bring a range of enjoyable content to each issue. We will have editorials looking at the latest big Nintendo stories and what's happened since the last issue, system recaps, informative interviews and huge cover features, all interwoven with amazing artwork, the latest reviews and even some fun and games! Oh, and fan content. We want your stuff. Letters (or emails), tweets, questions, artwork - all that sort of thing. We will be in touch closer to the launch with more details about those bits. All of the core games will have spreads just like this with bespoke artwork.</p>
<p>Everything is either in progress, already completed or awaiting release (reviews); we'd say around 50% of the content is already prepared.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>We have used Kickstarter for our previous issues, but with a pending project in the works we are not allowed to launch another on there until it is fulfilled. We didn't know this, and so need to find another means of funding Issue 4 so that we don't fall behind or miss major milestones! It's also useful research for future issues as to which works better!</p>
<p>We have successfully produced three issues thus far for Ninty Fresh Magazine, as well as 52 issues of Switch Player, our smaller and Switch-focused publication and are well-versed in hitting our deadlines and fulfilling issues!</p>
<p>Our target of £3000 will ensure that an 84-page print issue can be produced. We love Nintendo and think that coverage on Nintendo devices and fantastic writing should be back where it belongs - in print. We hope that this will be around for the long-haul; in fact, even our spines are being designed so that they'll make a pretty picture when put together. We'd need quite a few successful issue to achieve that!</p>
<p>If you like the sound of what we are doing, we have physical and digital options available, and some premium levels if you really want to help this project come to life. Please help us get a print Nintendo magazine back into people's hands.</p>

<h3>What can I get for supporting?</h3>
<p>We have four different ways that you can support us to get a copy of the magazine. There are the options and what you'll get!</p>
<p>The Magazine - the standard option will get you a copy of the magazine with standard shipping.</p>
<p>Premium - this level gets you the magazine, the PDF, a poster and an enamel pin badge depicting the triforce!</p>
<p>Super Mario 128 - as you can probably guess, there are 128 of these and you'll get the perks from the premium tier as well as a bonus poster and art print, a special badge and also your name in the magazine! The artwork for our Zelda feature will also come on NINE postcards.</p>
<p>Nintendo 64 - you'll get everything from the Super Mario 128 with your name upgraded to an image in the style of the team featured on a page as one of our sponsors. You'll also get a few extra bonus pieces of artwork.</p>
<p>However you want to support us, it's hugely appreciated and will go a long way to making our vision and dream a reality as well as keeping print Nintendo magazines alive!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge right now is obviously the ongoing global situation. However, our usual printing company are running as normal as is the Royal Mail, so delivery of these issues shouldn't be an issue. We've already successfully launched two issues, which should give you confidence that we know what we are doing. If you had any issues with NF01, NF2 or NF3 then I blame my kids, they helped me pack them so it was their fault! I'm joking, kids. But we also run Switch Player, which has over 50 issues. The financial cost of the project is managed versus the target. If we hit the target, we will be able to fund and manage the issue.</p>

   The world economy has become dominated by private military companies.Standing armies are now relegated to the roles of bargaining chips and display pieces - balanced precariously on the edge of a third global war, the world governments instead rely on mercenaries to enforce their policies and fight the multitude of small conflicts that have erupted in order to maintain the worldwide “peace.” With military contract work quickly becoming the world's most common profession, specialty “colleges” that focus on the higher-level learning of low-intensity conflict have been founded.After four years of friends lost and hard lessons learned, you find yourself appointed as a Special Adviser to the Asymmetric Strategies Institute, a prestigious multi-national contractor academy. The hybrid coach/talent scout position is regarded by many of your peers as a cushy admin job - an easy ride to a nice paycheck, without any real danger involved.The plan? Ride out your assignment while doing the least amount of work possible.But as everyone knows, no plan survives first contact with the enemy...  
   In addition to digital rewards (soundtrack and artbook), we have a few other physical items that will be available to backers as well! Physical reward selections can be changed down the line - we will be using BackerKit for reward confirmation and fulfillment, and that will be the choice that matters. This will take place a couple of weeks after the main IndieGoGo campaign is done, and will allow you to add individual items to your initial pledge if you want!PATCHESYou know we had to do it to ‘em. What WGW venture would be complete without patches to go with it? 4 different styles will be available, both for individual purchase through BackerKit and included as part of our tiers.Asymmetric Strategies Institute - ASI is the low-intensity conflict academywhere much of the visual novel takes place. As prestigious as the schoolis, their logo is very simple in design, featuring a short dagger separated into offset halves. The dagger symbolizes utility, concealment and speed - essential attributes for the contemporary, PMC-focused battlespace. Student patches are grey with a subdued green dagger, while faculty patches are black with a red dagger. Task Force Astral - Jake’s old team from his rotation to Somalia four years ago. On it, the Grim Reaper beckons the viewer to the stars - “You’re coming with me.” The team motto is displayed here, “AVAA,” which is an acronym for the Latin phrase Anima Vestra Ad Astra, or “Your soul, to the stars.” The unofficial motto, “RFS,” is much simpler and a more apt description - Real Fuckin’ Spooky.HTR TOMAHAWK - (Still in design phase). HTR TOMAHAWK is one of ASI's premier student-led small teams - it also has the distinction of being the only all-female HTR at the school.PINCHED STRAPSIt’s not every day that you will have gear or clothing that has velcro on it - enter the WGW character strap/PVC patch hybrid. Equally suited for hanging off of your phone or knife as it is attaching to your jacket velcro, the exclusive hybrid pinched straps will feature the girls in their school uniforms. The artwork for the straps is currently in-progress. They will be available individually through BackerKit and as part of several backer tiers.(sample hybrid pinched strap/PVC patch - artwork for backer exclusive items is not finalized)DAKIMAKURA COVERSAfter a long day out in the field,  nothing beats dropping your kit and getting into bed with your waifu. For these IndieGoGo exclusive daki covers, we are working with renowned artist Tony G to bring the ladies of HTR TOMAHAWK to reality. Currently we have the art for Tammy and Gisele - The other four girls are in-progress. You will be able to select which girl you want through BackerKit after the IndieGoGo campaign has ended! WALLSCROLLSWhat good weeaboo doesn't have a ton of anime girls plastered over their walls? Now, the girls of HTR Tomahawk can join the ranks of your favorite waifus hanging over your bed - With three planned variants! Variant 1: Title Splash ArtVariant 2: Beach Day (IN PROGRESS). Wetter is better. Join the girls of HTR Tomahawk as they hit the beach for some rigorous ""Amphibious Exercises.""Variant 3: A Night On The Town (IN PROGRESS). Always classy, just a little trashy, with the right amount of wrong. ASI's top ladies don their evening wear for a night of drinks and danger.GAME & ARTBOOKCloser to the end of development, physical copies of Kinetic Love Days and it's accompanying artbook will be created and shipped. These will be perfect collector's items for long time WGW fans! In order to green light the project, we will need to raise an amount of at least $20,000USD - the money necessary for the first payment for our artists and coder to begin working on Kinetic Love Days. The actual total for the entire project is $23,000USD and the closer we get to that, the better!BASE GOAL - $20,000. At this amount raised, the full development phase will begin. We expect 1.5-2 years in development, but if we can get it out sooner, even better! STRETCH GOALS$25,000 - Hiring a Japanese musician to create an opening song. While Studio 7.62 is doing awesome work for the project, how cool would it be if we had our very own OP for the visual novel? At $25,000 we will have enough to hire a singer/songwriter and have them make a song that would perfectly complement our opening sequence!$27,000 - Beach Episode.A visual novel romance isn't complete without a hot springs trip... or, failing that, a trip to the beach! Hitting $27,000 in pledges will unlock the episode Amphibious Training/Jungle Ops, where the crew take a trip to sunny Florida to ""learn the art of fighting while wet."" Whatever that means.$30,000 - Rina Route.""Your son calls me mommy, too."" As it stand, Rina (or Resting Bitch Face-chan) is the only major female character without a planned route. If we hit $30,000 in pledges we will make her route a reality - a true treat for all of you into Christmas cakes, as Rina is the closest thing we have to a MILF in the WGW lineup.",26.0,1,"1 Campaign
