<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Hey; first of all, thank you for visiting this page!</p>
<p>This campaign is for our ASD son, Tristan, who loves everyone, as well as every living thing. He is bored when he’s not helping them. For two years now (since he found out that we have a channel for sharing videos with family), he has wanted to become a YouTube creator. He has big plans for DIY videos educating other kids on fixing and making their own toys, teaching them what he knows about wildlife while hiking through the forest and showing them unheard of ways to play with toys at our beaches, and at our playgrounds...</p>
<p>With your contribution, he will inspire creative learning, expansive imagination, and adventurous outdoor activity.</p>
<p>You can help make his dream come true with projects that will inspire an entire generation, perhaps even future generations.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What Tristan Needs To Make Great Content</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">He needs $4000 for: a better quality camera; some lighting and some lavalier microphones; a directional microphone; a stabilizing gimbal; video editing software and a compatible dedicated computer.</p>

If you prefer not to be credited on his channel, just type “anonymous” as your first or last name as the source when you donate.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, even $5 will be enough for a low quality microphone, but any amount <u>up to</u> $4000 will go towards minimal production equipment for Tristan's channel, and any amount <u>above</u> will go towards even better production equipment for Tristan's channel!</p>

<h3>What is this all about?</h3>
<p>The microblogging landscape is grim.  Political agendas, censorship and a lack of transparency have become the norm, and Big Tech has forgotten about the most important thing; The User.</p>
<p>We are currently building a tech team to develop a free web and mobile device based platform, similar to Twitter/Youtube/Instagram, with more freedom, more intuitive navigation and even more profitable monetization.  This will all be built upon a foundational principle that people all over the world hold dear...the right to express themselves freely, without fear and without censorship.</p>
<p>We will also use incredible visualization to transparently track trends, your message history and other critical data.  This means, you will have intuitive and attractive features at your fingertips that make other platforms look outdated.</p>
<p>Welcome to Project 1A.</p>
<p>What makes us different?</p>
<ul>
<li>Free expression.</li>
<li>Transparency around decision making that affects users (no shadow bans, lockouts or random deletions.  If we do take an administrative action, it will be clear and there will be a transparent and interactive appeals process).</li>
<li>Massive monetization for citizen journalists and popular feeds based on written content (thread popularity and followers), video content, and image content.</li>
<li>A focus on self-censoring undesirable content, so a large organization isn't forced to take sweeping actions for you (ie. like Twitter).</li>
<li>No Political Agenda.  While all people have political beliefs that fall along party lines, these will not be a part of our organizational culture or decision making.</li>
</ul>
<p>What we won't allow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Criminal behavior or activity.</li>
<li>Anything that could harm children in any way.</li>
<li>Being used as a platform for hate speech groups or organizations.  </li>
<li>Shutting down political speech because it isn't politically correct or mainstream.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What do we need to get this started?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We need:</p>
<ul>
<li>We estimate at this time, we need $500,000 to get the app into development and to start building an infrastructure for launch.</li>
<li>You will get a variety of things for helping us get started.  Including many recognition badges as well as opportunities that could be big money makers for you when we launch!</li>
<li>The funds will all go towards the development of the project (staffing, infrastructure, etc.)  The funds will not go into any personal slush fund or be used for any other reason than to launch this project.  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Why we need this right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free expression can be brought back into the world of Social Media.</li>
<li>Our team will be experienced and focused on delivering user based satisfaction.</li>
<li>It will be a real app for you to enjoy, have fun, share, be political, not be political, and earn income with your talents.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The Tech Sector is massive and established.  We are taking a shot in a crowded area with strong agendas that do not support what we are trying to do.  This is not a traditionally developed technology company.  This is crowdfunded and built on principals that everyone holds dear.  Whether you are conservative, liberal, libertarian, or socialist, your voice deserves to be heard.  If you are an artist and you want to earn income based on your talents, your talents need to be expressed.  If you are a journalist and you want to get your information directly to the people and be paid for it, you have a right to set up shop and do your thing.</p>
<p>How will we overcome these challenges?</p>
<ul>
<li>One thing about social media is, the people will go where the freedom is.  The better the platform, the more users will use it.  We will make a great platform.</li>
<li>We will listen and adapt when needed.</li>
<li>We will always be looking at the user experience as our main focus.</li>
<li>We will always be looking at how to maximize our user monetization.</li>
<li>We will always work on making our platform financially strong.</li>
<li>We will need your help to get this launched!  Tell everyone and if you know technical people who will donate time or energy to this project, let us know!</li>

<h3>Vi har brug for jeres hjælp til at fortsætte Det 3. Hjul i 2020</h3>
<h3> </h3>

Hjul</a>, og vi har nu brug for jeres hjælp til at holde liv i vores hjertebarn til næste år.  Bag podcasten står vi: Asser Jorsal Pelle, Jonas Øhlenschlæger Hansen og Lars Drost Hundebøll - tre 30-årige gode venner, der altid har elsket professionel cykling. </p>
<p>Det 3. Hjul blev startet i 2017, fordi vi synes, der manglede en nørdet og let tilgængelig podcast om nutidig cykelsport. Samtidigt ønskede vi at dele vores store begejstring for sporten og for analyser af løbene med så mange mennesker som overhovedet muligt. Hurtigt fandt vi ud af, at andre cykelelskere heldigvis gad at lytte til det, vi har at sige, hvilket vi er enormt taknemmelige over.<br/><br/>Siden er projektet vokset stødt, så vi i løbet af de seneste 2,5 år har haft over 120.000 downloads og udgivet over 200 afsnit. Ved siden af har vi en efterhånden velbesøgt <a href=""https://da-dk.facebook.com/Det3.hjul/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebookside</a> og hjemmesiden <a href=""http://det3hjul.dk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">det3hjul.dk</a>, hvor vi giver tips til holdet.dk's cykelmanagerspil og til gode odds, vi falder over på vores vej.</p>
<p>Vi har med nød og næppe kunne holde projektet i gang med sponsoraftaler m.v. men med tre fuldtidsjobs og familie ved siden af, kniber det med tiden, og det er ikke helt gratis af producere podcast og afholde konkurrencer. Vi vil dog meget gerne fortsætte til næste år i 2020, og en mindre økonomisk håndstrækning vil hjælpe os med at få tingene til at hænge sammen i en travl hverdag.<br/><br/>På forhånd tak. </p>

Desuden vil vi lave etapeoptakter på skrift med tips til Tourspillet på holdet.dk i 2020.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Andet mål: </strong>Hjælper I os med 20.000 kroner, gør vi alt i første mål og laver etapeoptakter på skrift med tips til Girospillet på holdet.dk i 2020.</p></li>

<strong>Tredje mål: </strong>Hjælper I os med 25.000 kroner, gør vi alt i første og andet mål og laver etapeoptakter på skrift med tips til Vueltaspillet på holdet.dk 2020.<br/> </li>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Du får desuden: </strong>Alt efter, hvilket beløb, du generøst har lyst til at hjælpe os med, så får du alt fra gode tanker til særlige fordele. Blandt andet kan du vælge en legende, eller få en til lejligheden unikt produceret legende-kop. Du kan også få god cykelbog til ferien, eller en tur i studiet med os. Og  du kan støtte med lige det beløb, du har lyst til!</p>

<li>Lægge et godt ord ind for os hos din rige og cykelgale onkel ;) <br/> </li>
</ul>
<p>Vi vil så gerne fortsætte med projektet, men det kræver en hjælpende hånd, og vi takker mange gange alle, der har lyst og mulighed for at støtte Det. 3 Hjul.

<p>In early 2019, we came up with the idea to do a musical podcast together. A queer musical podcast. We immediately began thinking of multiple plot lines, and that soon evolved into Queer Girls Guide, a musical podcast, where each season is a standalone musical about different queer women going through their lives.</p>
<p>In addition to the standalone seasons, there are also mini episodes with covers of songs and characters from different seasons. While the full-length episodes have original queer-themed music, the mini episodes have covers of songs, with many of them edited to be queer. Most seasons surround either only two characters or two main characters. We wanted to not only create musicals that would be easy to listen to and still get a full story, but we also wanted to really focus on different, relatable relationships of all kinds. Be forewarned… not every story ends in a romantic happily ever after.</p>
<p>Currently, we are in our first round of mini episodes. Due to the recent novel coronavirus, we have decided to push back our original first season, Falling in Love With Your Best Friend, and have created Social Distancing. Two new roommates are now stuck in self-quarantine together, trying to work from home while also questioning if their sudden interest in the other person is real or if it’s just because of the forced isolation together.</p>
<p>Since we are separated at the moment due to travel bans, <i>Queer Girls Guide</i> will be released about six months early! We have a release date planned for May. Yup. You'll get to hear our first mini episode in a month! In between full seasons, there will be mini episodes with characters from full seasons. Get ready!</p>
<p>Sign up for our <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/queergirlsguide"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Patreon</a> to get exclusive content and episodes not available on our regular feed. You will also be able to watch live streams and get first looks at future projects.</p>

<p>There are so many facets to putting a podcast together. We have been working on scripts and lyrics for the original first season since 2019. Our goal is to raise enough funds to support the technical side of things. High on the list of goals is hiring a music producer to assist in the creative process - to make sure the music quality of the podcast is as good as we’re envisioning. We are hoping to eventually update the software and equipment used to record each episode and to cover the cost of marketing so that more queer girls have the opportunity to hear and share their own stories through podcasting. </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Perks</h2>
<p>There are heaps of perks involved for backers, including a private Facebook group where you can discuss the latest episodes, see some hilarious behind the scenes content (and blooper reels), meet like-minded people and contact us if social media is more your thing. Starting at the Red Tier, you'll get access to regular posts, updates, and fun things we'll be posting on Facebook. That will also be the first place that we look for more cast and crew as well as what listeners want to see on the show.</p>

<p>We all know that mainstream media (including podcasts) are completely overrun with cliche straight stories, written about similar characters, over and over again. We hope to give queer girls a space of their own, something to break the monotony. </p>
<p>(Catarina actually went to college to learn how to write good… Me? I dabble in the odd bit of writing but I’m not smart enough to put out the content she does, however from a musical standpoint, I’m your gal…) Queer Girls Guide is the perfect combination of Catarina’s skills as a producer, Sara’s as a performer, and our need to have diverse stories distributed in an easy-to-access format. </p>
<p>The more stories we can produce, the more people we can help. We want queer content to become one of those things that people just enjoy, no matter their gender, sexuality, or culture. If you love musicals, Queer Girls Guide is the perfect mix of queer content, real stories, and fun musical numbers that will have you singing along in no time. </p>

<p>What happens if we don’t reach our goal? Well. We have put the time and effort into the creation of QGG over the last year. The script is written and currently in the process of sound testing and recording. If the goal is not reached in time, the show will still go on! Unfortunately, it will just be a very slow editing process with low quality. We want to post something for everyone to listen to at least once a week, but we need better hardware and software. We also really want to add amazing music to the show. In addition to trying to get some licensing for covers, we are hoping to get some musicians involved. While we work hard and have been writing the music ourselves as best as we can, we know that a composer and some musicians would completely round out the show.</p>
<p>At the moment, we are using a combination of stock audio available for podcast use, Catarina’s not terrible guitar skills, and Sara’s insistence on playing the spoons. (Yes. The f***ing spoons.)</p>
<p>Being the first show produced under the Queer Girls Guide name, you may be curious as to the quality of the content, but rest assured, that thanks to Sara’s background in opera and musical theatre, she is more than capable of carrying Catarina’s slack… (I’m kidding, my fiancee is incredible and has already produced the first season of her web series, The Bech.)</p>
<p>In addition to a risk of music variety and sound quality, we are also facing the challenge of marketing. While we have eight seasons already in mind for this, we need to get people listening early. The challenge is getting people to find us and push play. After that, QGG will do the rest.</p>
<p>Between the two of us, we can put out some real quality content.  #wegetthejobdone</p>

I’m Catarina, the founder of the coming-soon-to-your-favorite-podcast-listening-app podcast network, Battling Bard Podcast Network. In 2019, I began drafting scripts and creating several different shows that go with my writing and web series portfolio. In addition to QGG, we also have a Xena Reboot podcast in the works with a full cast. I’ve been in love with podcasts since a friend introduced to My Favorite Murder. Even though I started in true crime, audio dramas have been my true podcast passion. Writing and producing are two of my biggest passions, along with martial arts, and I love putting out diverse content that just really tells stories that people will connect with and want to get more of. On Archive of Our Own, I’ve published nearly 800,000 words across several fandoms. I write all lengths, from two sentence horror stories to fantasy novels. </p>
<p>While I have only been producing at a publishing level of quality since The Bech, I have been producing random content since I was a child. I used to make my friends perform mini plays, and I once wrote an American history play for a kindergarten class that we actually staged for their parents. You haven’t seen cute until you watch a five-year-old boy with a thick Spanish accent walking around with his stage manager clipboard and telling everyone where to go. I’m a strong believer of creating the content you want to see in the world.</p>

I’m super stoked to be working with Catarina on this project. Musical theatre has been a huge part of my life since I was a child, so being able to bring that fun and magic to the general public via this podcast makes me giddy. Even though I spend most of my weekends and nights singing away (anything from Tosca to Mean Girls is fair game) and annoying the neighbours, my main job is even cooler.  I’m a zookeeper! My favourite animals to work with are definitely birds, but I also have a very soft spot for crocodilians.  </p>
<p>Podcasts are a new venture for me. Catarina introduced me to them in early 2019 to stop my heavy rotation of the Frozen Musical soundtrack and my ultimate Taylor Swift playlist. Since then I’ve found a few really cool ones that I listen to every time a new episode is released. The idea of having a podcast completely catered for people exactly like me is something that has driven me to get this completed over the last few months. </p>

</div></div>","In early 2019, we came up with the idea to do a musical podcast together. A queer musical podcast. We immediately began thinking of multiple plot lines, and that soon evolved into Queer Girls Guide, a musical podcast, where each season is a standalone musical about different queer women going through their lives.
In addition to the standalone seasons, there are also mini episodes with covers of songs and characters from different seasons. While the full-length episodes have original queer-themed music, the mini episodes have covers of songs, with many of them edited to be queer. Most seasons surround either only two characters or two main characters. We wanted to not only create musicals that would be easy to listen to and still get a full story, but we also wanted to really focus on different, relatable relationships of all kinds. Be forewarned… not every story ends in a romantic happily ever after.
Currently, we are in our first round of mini episodes. Due to the recent novel coronavirus, we have decided to push back our original first season, Falling in Love With Your Best Friend, and have created Social Distancing. Two new roommates are now stuck in self-quarantine together, trying to work from home while also questioning if their sudden interest in the other person is real or if it’s just because of the forced isolation together.
Since we are separated at the moment due to travel bans, Queer Girls Guide will be released about six months early! We have a release date planned for May. Yup. You'll get to hear our first mini episode in a month! In between full seasons, there will be mini episodes with characters from full seasons. Get ready!
Sign up for our Patreon to get exclusive content and episodes not available on our regular feed. You will also be able to watch live streams and get first looks at future projects.
 
Thank you for all of your support. Queer Girls Guide is nothing without listeners and supporters.
 
 

Milestones


There are so many facets to putting a podcast together. We have been working on scripts and lyrics for the original first season since 2019. Our goal is to raise enough funds to support the technical side of things. High on the list of goals is hiring a music producer to assist in the creative process - to make sure the music quality of the podcast is as good as we’re envisioning. We are hoping to eventually update the software and equipment used to record each episode and to cover the cost of marketing so that more queer girls have the opportunity to hear and share their own stories through podcasting. 
Stretch Goals

 
Perks
There are heaps of perks involved for backers, including a private Facebook group where you can discuss the latest episodes, see some hilarious behind the scenes content (and blooper reels), meet like-minded people and contact us if social media is more your thing. Starting at the Red Tier, you'll get access to regular posts, updates, and fun things we'll be posting on Facebook. That will also be the first place that we look for more cast and crew as well as what listeners want to see on the show.

We all know that mainstream media (including podcasts) are completely overrun with cliche straight stories, written about similar characters, over and over again. We hope to give queer girls a space of their own, something to break the monotony. 
(Catarina actually went to college to learn how to write good… Me? I dabble in the odd bit of writing but I’m not smart enough to put out the content she does, however from a musical standpoint, I’m your gal…) Queer Girls Guide is the perfect combination of Catarina’s skills as a producer, Sara’s as a performer, and our need to have diverse stories distributed in an easy-to-access format. 
The more stories we can produce, the more people we can help. We want queer content to become one of those things that people just enjoy, no matter their gender, sexuality, or culture. If you love musicals, Queer Girls Guide is the perfect mix of queer content, real stories, and fun musical numbers that will have you singing along in no time. 
 


 
 

What happens if we don’t reach our goal? Well. We have put the time and effort into the creation of QGG over the last year. The script is written and currently in the process of sound testing and recording. If the goal is not reached in time, the show will still go on! Unfortunately, it will just be a very slow editing process with low quality. We want to post something for everyone to listen to at least once a week, but we need better hardware and software. We also really want to add amazing music to the show. In addition to trying to get some licensing for covers, we are hoping to get some musicians involved. While we work hard and have been writing the music ourselves as best as we can, we know that a composer and some musicians would completely round out the show.
At the moment, we are using a combination of stock audio available for podcast use, Catarina’s not terrible guitar skills, and Sara’s insistence on playing the spoons. (Yes. The f***ing spoons.)
Being the first show produced under the Queer Girls Guide name, you may be curious as to the quality of the content, but rest assured, that thanks to Sara’s background in opera and musical theatre, she is more than capable of carrying Catarina’s slack… (I’m kidding, my fiancee is incredible and has already produced the first season of her web series, The Bech.)

Between the two of us, we can put out some real quality content.  #wegetthejobdone
 
 


We know how difficult it can be for some people to provide paid support, but there are other ways to help out!
Are you a composer or musician? Or do you know someone? We are hoping to showcase a variety of composers and musicians in the queer community. 
If you are interested in helping with music, marketing, or just have a story to share, please feel free to email us at queergirlsguidepodcast@gmail.com for more information.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey there! I'm Charmaine Campbell, creator of The Left Hand Club. I've been married for 6 years and I'm just starting to feel like I understand what in the world this married life is about. I along with many of my peers, don't know much about how to navigate through the many struggles that come with this journey. Everyone has marriage advice, but no one truly understands until they go through it. I see a lack of education in our generation. I see relationships crumbling all around me. And something has been tugging at my heart for quite sometime to create something that will help. </p>
<p>With that being said, I've created an environment, a virtual space where married couples, engaged couples, even couples that are dating to come, learn, and grow. I've created a brand that will allow us to proudly represent the married community. In this space, they will see other couples, just like them. Here they will be able to relate. And as we all know, the one thing we all want is for people to understand. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This campaign will assist with startup costs, such as:</p>
<p>Stationery, Apparel/Merchandise, Legal, Marketing, Equipment, Inventory/Supplies, and more. </p>
<p><font>I will be creating all content, apparel, and merchandise myself.</font></p>
<p><font>No matter if the goal is reached, I am grateful for the support and love from my friends and family. </font></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Years ago, I was struggling in my own marriage. I was watching others struggle too. No one knew what to do, and how to navigate through COMMON issues that come with learning someone new. There really wasn't anything out there to help. And the content that did exist, you have to pay for: Marriage Counseling. That gave me the idea to create something free, that people can relate to, learn from, and apply in real life. I also wanted to create a brand worth wearing. </p>
<p><font>This is much needed in our society today. </font>I am grateful my husband and I have gotten as far as we have in this marriage. We have been through so much. And I know many couples have as well. Marriage is something to celebrate. It is something to love, enjoy, build, grow, and understand. My hope is that through this, many will be uplifted and renewed.</p>

Get swept away into a witty, space-time spanning rollercoaster ride of Looney Tunes hijinks and cartoonish comedy. It reminds me of my favourite audio fiction comedies, from Victoriocity and Wooden Overcoats to Oblivity and The Amelia Project. If you want your ears full of laugh out loud audio mayhem, please help bring this project to life!""- Ella Watts, BBC Studios, The OrphansWell, hello there.In 2020, we created an audio sitcom adventure about conspiracies gone disastrously wrong--a show where we follow the misadventures of a band of Illuminati goons as they careen helplessly through history snatching defeat from the jaws of other, weirder defeats. Our first season followed our protagonists as they tried, and disastrously failed, to keep the secrets of the pyramids in ancient Egypt.For our second season, we wanted to channel a conspiracy of an entirely different order; our Illiminauts Beck, Jackie, Ishmael and Dal manage to fail so hard to fake the Moon landing they're forced to… actually land on the Moon.We're introducing elements as absurd as astronaut oxygen hose-fights, pathological obsessions with the perfect Moon movie, and putting nukes on the Moon. How? Why? We'll have to reach our Season 2 funding goal if you want to find out!The money will allow us to record our second season in the beautiful Bridge studio, letting us achieve the ensemble-style chemistry we crave, nay, demand in order to make the perfect conspiracy entertainment experience. Backer tiers include rewards as exciting as selecting additional minisodes for future seasons, exclusive cut scene recordings from the ""word graveyard,"" and an invitation to the cast party we were never able to throw for Season 1 because there was a pandemic!""One of the funniest scripted podcasts out there, with brilliant characters and a wildly imaginative world. We need more!"" - Tom Crowley, Wooden Overcoats, Victoriocity, Crowley Time with me, Tom CrowleySeason 1 allowed us to show the world our comedy chops and work out the kinks in our process, our recording, and our writing. It also worked the dang money out of our bank accounts! And to make Season 2 a success we'll need your help. $5,000 will let us rent out the beautiful Bridge studio, continue to reward our actors for their time and effort, and pay our sound designer.REWARDSWhat, you want more than the warm glow of helping us achieve our dreams? You can get the following ""THANK YOU!!"" rewards for backing us at the following levels:TIER 1: SOCIAL MEDIA SHOUT-OUT ($5)We'll thank you for backing our show on Twitter, and we'll do it during those premium social media posting hours. Impress friends, family, and new lovers! Intimidate enemies and rivals!TIER 2: EARLY EPISODE ACCESS ($15)Most listeners will have to wait for each episode to come out when the new season airs. You can listen to the full season all at once, a month before it airs, because you're a paying customer.TIER 3: STICKERS ($25)We'll send you one of our lovely die-cut stickers of Tom Crowley's rocket pyramid to put on your water bottle or in the streets of your sleepy college town as a thank you for supporting the show. Show off your sticker and say, ""yeah, you got these idiot jokes because of me. And I have proof!""TIER 4: PINS ($50)Bluff your way into the inner halls of power with an official Illuminati Pin bearing the illuminati’s oldest and most well known motto - Illuminati Ollominoto! Be careful, if you get caught they will kill you. OVERSEAS ILLUMINAUTS TAKE HEED - shipping is not included in the pin price, and overseas shipping right now is very prohibitive. You can get an estimate here.TIER 5: LAUNCH PARTY INVITE ($100)We told our actors we were going to throw them a cast party during Season 1's wrap, but apparently there was (checks notes) A worldwide pandemic? At $100, you can come to our long-delayed cast party.

<p>Neo-Atlantis. The New World. Home to Kraken Technologies, the world's largest, most dominant mega corporation... and to you. Well, you if you're lucky enough to have been born within it's walls or maybe you were a valuable enough commodity that the corporation deemed you an asset. Otherwise you're likely living in the sprawl. With the rest of us. Specifically the underbelly District of Arcadia... along with the synths who ran away from their duties, the refugees who made it over the wall and the androids who didn't quite 'earn' a place for themselves in Neo-Atlantis proper.

<h3>OUR CAMPAIGN</h3>
<p>The first season of this serial audio drama, <i>'Breakwall',</i> introduced you to not only the city of Neo-Atlantis but to the merc Jonny and her crew. You were there with her through shoot outs and flying car chases. Laughs and tears. Now, <strong>Red Fathom Entertainment</strong> is excited to announce the return of <i>Cybernautica</i> for it's second season. Code named <i>'Undertow'</i>, the new season is set to continue the story. In Undertow, we find ourselves following the psychic detective Waylon Grant as he drags some familiar, returning characters along on his search for his childhood friend, Alex Webb. The stakes are going to get much higher in Undertow as we introduce you to a long sunken conspiracy, deep faction politics AND the machinations of Kraken itself. Not only that, but this campaign will also be funding a 4 part mini-series that takes place between Breakwall &amp; Undertow! This series will be an original story that is... loosely connected to what is happening in our main story, helping to pave the way for some future questions to be answered...<br/><br/>We were able to bring season one together on a shoestring budget. In all of our productions we've always held it as a point of pride that everyone working with us gets paid, and before now that's been done with a mix of my personal money and our amazingly loyal patrons. In this rather ambitious second outing, we've nearly doubled our cast AND brought in some extra help on the production side in the form of a director. We're bolstering our sound design as well with new tools and plug ins and trying to get this season penned BEFORE we record so as to be able to guarantee a steady release schedule rather then making it happen whenever we can scrape together a budget for it and fit things through last minute. As it happens, preparation and just overall doing things better costs money.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHO IS RED FATHOM ENTERTAINMENT?</h3>
<p>We're a Canadian based indie studio (contracting voice and production talent worldwide) that survives largely off of crowd funding initiatives at this point, resisting ads and paywalls for content whenever possible. As of this campaign we've been making audio drama for nearly five years, getting our start in writing and producing a grim audio drama called <strong>Redmond Born</strong> before creating the first season of Cybernautica. Recently, we've also added the comedy/horror show <strong>Hannahpocalypse</strong> to our lineup!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>THE MONEY (And where it's goin'!)</h3>
<p>We've done our very best to estimate our costs for the production of Season 2 of Cybernautica. While our Patreon will continue to help pay for our various subscriptions, hosting and general operational costs, this campaign is primarily concerned with making the new season happen. We've ambitiously not only doubled our voice acting cast but also brought some exciting (much needed) talent onto the production side of the show! </p>
<p>The below budget is our best estimate for creating both the new season AND a pre-season mini series!</p>
<p><u><strong>Voice Actors</strong>:</u> $2500 - Our best estimate for paying both our main cast and ensemble actors!</p>
<p><u><strong>Production</strong>:</u> </p>
<p><u>Writing/Editing: $600</u> - This covers script editing and a cut for guest writers such as Alexander Baxter, who has come on to write our pre-season mini series!</p>
<p><u>Sound Design: $1500</u> - Pays for our enhanced sound design budget, allowing Damian to get some help on the sound design side of things as well by bringing someone on!</p>
<p><u>Director: $500</u> - Amanda Hufford joins the Cybernautica team as a director this season, helping our talented actors bring their very best to an often complex remote recording process. </p>
<p><u>Supporting: $500</u> - Fee's from Indiegogog as well as splash money for other unforeseen incidental costs.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>STRETCH GOALS</strong></h3>
<p>In the event that we manage to achieve and surpass our initial budgeting goals, we have some extra treats in mind that will get even more out of your time in Neo-Atlantis during this coming season!</p>
<p><strong>$6500</strong> - <strong>Special Episode - </strong>So we might know some really talented writers out there in the world of Cyberpunk, some with names on the front of novels even! At this level, we make a few calls and get one of them to come in and write a truly unforgettable stand alone episode for us.</p>
<p><strong>$8000 </strong>- <strong>Composer - </strong>We love our theme song, but it's not OUR theme song. It was created and unleashed upon the internet for free use. If we hit this goal, we bring on a composer to reimagine the theme and create us a powerful new theme to get you immersed each and every time you queue up an episode! Trust me, this will be aces.</p>
<p><strong>$10,000 - Dark Fathom Mini-Series</strong> - At this level, we're going to give you a special mini-series from the perspective of the radical liberation faction, Dark Fathom... tying unanswered questions regarding both the Siren, Dark Fathom and even The Gentleman from the Transition Anthology together.</p>
<p><strong>$14,000</strong> - <strong>Season 3 </strong>- Well, what can we say at this point that hasn't already been said. Once we hit this stretch goal we can pretty much assume that you've paid the lions share of production for a third and final season of Cybernautica, allowing us to get to work on that without launching another campaign!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>REWARDS</strong></h3>
<p>They say Neo-Atlantis always collects it's price. So too, can that be said for karma... and yours is good, friend. Let us get into your reward for helping us make this season the best it can be!</p>
<p><u>Arcadian $5</u> - The lowest tier is often the backbone of any successful campaign. Arcadia itself would be nothing without those who fill her streets, fighting for a better tomorrow for themselves and their fellow Arcadian. At this level you'll get a <strong>Cybernautica 'Kraken' sticker</strong>, a <strong>thank you letter</strong>, and your name on the <strong>Hall of Fame section of our website.</strong> You'll also enjoy access to a backstage channel in our discord as well as a special role to distinguish your generosity!</p>
<p><u>Citizen $25</u> - Whether you were born there, made their or you bought your way in... you're a citizen of Neo-Atlantis proper. As a citizen level backer, you will enjoy access to the rewards of previous tiers as well as a <strong>special 'Jonny' button</strong>! If that's not good enough you'll also get exclusive access to <strong>a prologue episode featuring Evan &amp; Ella</strong>!</p>
<p><u>Merc $50</u> - The movers and shakers that work on behalf of the Underworld and the very hand of the factions. You get it DONE. As before, you are entitled to previous tiers as well as one of our <strong>limited edition</strong> <strong>Kraken lapel pins </strong>and an invite to our advance listening party with members of the cast and crew!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605490500/ctwemrzwgpzq2nkrhete.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><u>Underw</u><u>orld $100</u> - Collectively, The Underworld is the most powerful organization in Neo-Atlantis besides Kraken itself. At this level, you reap the rewards of all previous tiers as well as the big one. You will be entitled to<strong> (1) Underworld 'Chip'</strong>. These special coins will only be available through this campaign, the future RPG crowdfunding campaign and special events and will NOT be available as a purchasable item. Below is the in universe version of the 'Chips', our version will be more like a large collectable coin!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605490461/qgrq2nipuykj0imewg9v.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><u>Contractor $300</u> - You build this city, supply it's streets with what the people need and are probably secretly controlled by some criminal or corporate interest of some kind but we need not get into that when you're reaping Kraken contracts! At this level we work with you to get <strong>a character of your design into Neo-Atlantis</strong>. This character will join the lore of the world in some way and appear at some point within Season 2! That and all the tiers above this level!</p>
<p><u>Kraken Executive $500</u> - Oh, mysterious and deific overseer... Though most citizens will never meet you in their lifetime, stories are told and we all look up to the structures atop the Core in wonder. All doors are open to you. To show our gratitude you'll receive an <strong>Executive Producer Credit</strong> on the show for every episode of the season. We'll also work with you to promote a project of your own on one of our episodes with some <strong>ad space</strong>!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</strong></h3>
<p>Making audio drama is a challenging gig. Fortunately we're used to these challenges. Many folk on the outside don't know but the money we're looking for here is essentially in the providence of 'passion project' rates and the <i>true</i> cost of a production like this is exponentially higher. Whether we secure this funding completely or not, Season 2 of Cybernautica WILL happen. We'll just have to get scrappier about it, much in the same way as we did during Season 1. Things will just take... longer. Be harder. Covering these costs up front will remove a lot of budget originating delays from a process that is already a complicated one with the challenges of a remotely recorded show.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>OTHER WAYS TO HELP</strong></h3>
<p>This is a tough time for all of us. Though some of us have the income to be able to help artists and creators make things and get through this... we understand that not everyone is okay right now. During this pandemic it's been my belief that we need art more then ever, and one of the ways you can help in a non financial way is to retweet and talk about the show on social media. Tell people wherever you can about what we're doing here.</p>
<p>If you'd like to help us above and beyond this campaign, we do have a <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/cybernautica"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">patreon</a> account set up. Our patreon provides us with monthly income and often pays for small things such as hosting, website stuff and other needs of the show like commissioning art and all around assisting ongoing show initiatives (hell, one day it might even pay ME for this stuff!)</p>

In Undertow, we find ourselves following the psychic detective Waylon Grant as he drags some familiar, returning characters along on his search for his childhood friend, Alex Webb. The stakes are going to get much higher in Undertow as we introduce you to a long sunken conspiracy, deep faction politics AND the machinations of Kraken itself. Not only that, but this campaign will also be funding a 4 part mini-series that takes place between Breakwall & Undertow! This series will be an original story that is... loosely connected to what is happening in our main story, helping to pave the way for some future questions to be answered...We were able to bring season one together on a shoestring budget. In all of our productions we've always held it as a point of pride that everyone working with us gets paid, and before now that's been done with a mix of my personal money and our amazingly loyal patrons. In this rather ambitious second outing, we've nearly doubled our cast AND brought in some extra help on the production side in the form of a director. We're bolstering our sound design as well with new tools and plug ins and trying to get this season penned BEFORE we record so as to be able to guarantee a steady release schedule rather then making it happen whenever we can scrape together a budget for it and fit things through last minute. As it happens, preparation and just overall doing things better costs money.
 

WHO IS RED FATHOM ENTERTAINMENT?
We're a Canadian based indie studio (contracting voice and production talent worldwide) that survives largely off of crowd funding initiatives at this point, resisting ads and paywalls for content whenever possible. As of this campaign we've been making audio drama for nearly five years, getting our start in writing and producing a grim audio drama called Redmond Born before creating the first season of Cybernautica. Recently, we've also added the comedy/horror show Hannahpocalypse to our lineup!
 

THE MONEY (And where it's goin'!)
We've done our very best to estimate our costs for the production of Season 2 of Cybernautica. While our Patreon will continue to help pay for our various subscriptions, hosting and general operational costs, this campaign is primarily concerned with making the new season happen. We've ambitiously not only doubled our voice acting cast but also brought some exciting (much needed) talent onto the production side of the show! 
The below budget is our best estimate for creating both the new season AND a pre-season mini series!
Voice Actors: $2500 - Our best estimate for paying both our main cast and ensemble actors!
Production: 
Writing/Editing: $600 - This covers script editing and a cut for guest writers such as Alexander Baxter, who has come on to write our pre-season mini series!
Sound Design: $1500 - Pays for our enhanced sound design budget, allowing Damian to get some help on the sound design side of things as well by bringing someone on!
Director: $500 - Amanda Hufford joins the Cybernautica team as a director this season, helping our talented actors bring their very best to an often complex remote recording process. 
Supporting: $500 - Fee's from Indiegogog as well as splash money for other unforeseen incidental costs.
 
STRETCH GOALS
In the event that we manage to achieve and surpass our initial budgeting goals, we have some extra treats in mind that will get even more out of your time in Neo-Atlantis during this coming season!
$6500 - Special Episode - So we might know some really talented writers out there in the world of Cyberpunk, some with names on the front of novels even! At this level, we make a few calls and get one of them to come in and write a truly unforgettable stand alone episode for us.
$8000 - Composer - We love our theme song, but it's not OUR theme song. It was created and unleashed upon the internet for free use. If we hit this goal, we bring on a composer to reimagine the theme and create us a powerful new theme to get you immersed each and every time you queue up an episode! Trust me, this will be aces.
$10,000 - Dark Fathom Mini-Series - At this level, we're going to give you a special mini-series from the perspective of the radical liberation faction, Dark Fathom... tying unanswered questions regarding both the Siren, Dark Fathom and even The Gentleman from the Transition Anthology together.
$14,000 - Season 3 - Well, what can we say at this point that hasn't already been said. Once we hit this stretch goal we can pretty much assume that you've paid the lions share of production for a third and final season of Cybernautica, allowing us to get to work on that without launching another campaign!
 
REWARDS
They say Neo-Atlantis always collects it's price. So too, can that be said for karma... and yours is good, friend. Let us get into your reward for helping us make this season the best it can be!
Arcadian $5 - The lowest tier is often the backbone of any successful campaign. Arcadia itself would be nothing without those who fill her streets, fighting for a better tomorrow for themselves and their fellow Arcadian. At this level you'll get a Cybernautica 'Kraken' sticker, a thank you letter, and your name on the Hall of Fame section of our website. You'll also enjoy access to a backstage channel in our discord as well as a special role to distinguish your generosity!
Citizen $25 - Whether you were born there, made their or you bought your way in... you're a citizen of Neo-Atlantis proper. As a citizen level backer, you will enjoy access to the rewards of previous tiers as well as a special 'Jonny' button! If that's not good enough you'll also get exclusive access to a prologue episode featuring Evan & Ella!
Merc $50 - The movers and shakers that work on behalf of the Underworld and the very hand of the factions. You get it DONE. As before, you are entitled to previous tiers as well as one of our limited edition Kraken lapel pins and an invite to our advance listening party with members of the cast and crew!

Underworld $100 - Collectively, The Underworld is the most powerful organization in Neo-Atlantis besides Kraken itself. At this level, you reap the rewards of all previous tiers as well as the big one. You will be entitled to (1) Underworld 'Chip'. These special coins will only be available through this campaign, the future RPG crowdfunding campaign and special events and will NOT be available as a purchasable item. Below is the in universe version of the 'Chips', our version will be more like a large collectable coin!
Contractor $300 - You build this city, supply it's streets with what the people need and are probably secretly controlled by some criminal or corporate interest of some kind but we need not get into that when you're reaping Kraken contracts! At this level we work with you to get a character of your design into Neo-Atlantis. This character will join the lore of the world in some way and appear at some point within Season 2! That and all the tiers above this level!
Kraken Executive $500 - Oh, mysterious and deific overseer... Though most citizens will never meet you in their lifetime, stories are told and we all look up to the structures atop the Core in wonder. All doors are open to you. To show our gratitude you'll receive an Executive Producer Credit on the show for every episode of the season. We'll also work with you to promote a project of your own on one of our episodes with some ad space!
 
RISKS & CHALLENGES
Making audio drama is a challenging gig. Fortunately we're used to these challenges. Many folk on the outside don't know but the money we're looking for here is essentially in the providence of 'passion project' rates and the true cost of a production like this is exponentially higher. Whether we secure this funding completely or not, Season 2 of Cybernautica WILL happen. We'll just have to get scrappier about it, much in the same way as we did during Season 1. Things will just take... longer. Be harder. Covering these costs up front will remove a lot of budget originating delays from a process that is already a complicated one with the challenges of a remotely recorded show.
 
OTHER WAYS TO HELP
This is a tough time for all of us. Though some of us have the income to be able to help artists and creators make things and get through this... we understand that not everyone is okay right now. During this pandemic it's been my belief that we need art more then ever, and one of the ways you can help in a non financial way is to retweet and talk about the show on social media. Tell people wherever you can about what we're doing here.
If you'd like to help us above and beyond this campaign, we do have a patreon account set up. Our patreon provides us with monthly income and often pays for small things such as hosting, website stuff and other needs of the show like commissioning art and all around assisting ongoing show initiatives (hell, one day it might even pay ME for this stuff!)",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>The (Ghost) Story</h2>
<p><i>The Way We Haunt Now</i> is a lighthearted horror audio drama about friendship, found family, and fighting the narratives that try to define us–even in the afterlife. Oh, and ghosts. We definitely should’ve mentioned the ghosts. </p>
<p>In Season One, dual protagonists Eulalie Elizabeth Reed (living) and Frances Matilda Summerson (dead) found themselves thrown together when Eulalie bought a broken old phonograph at a thrift shop and awakened Frankie’s spirit while repairing it. One thing led to another and, well, in brief:</p>
<ul>
<li>Haunting</li>
<li>Romance?</li>
<li>Hospitalization</li>
<li>More Ghosts!</li>
<li>Ghost Hunters</li>
<li>A Singalong For Some Horrible Reason?</li>
<li>Frankie Getting Mostly Exorcised</li>
<li>A Talking Apartment!?!?!</li>
</ul>
<p>Season Two will pick up a few weeks after the events of Season One, with Eulalie finally out of the hospital and trying to figure out how to pick up the pieces, our friendly neighborhood ghosts working double time to rescue Frankie from her fate, and our intrepid team of ghost hunters trying to pinpoint what went wrong with their exorcism. </p>
<p>Along the way, we’ll address the following unfinished business: </p>
<ul>
<li>Will Frankie ever be free of the apartment? </li>
<li>What happens between Eulalie and her lady doctor friend? </li>
<li>Why does Alicia know so much about this ghost stuff? </li>
<li>What brought Mary, Josie, and Lota together and what keeps them on this mortal plain? Will the spectral labradoodle ever follow Lota home? </li>
<li>And, uhhhhh, what is Eulalie gonna do about the fact that she’s suddenly seeing ghosts everywhere???</li>
</ul>
<p>Help us answer all of these questions–and meet some famous ghosts along the way–by pitching in a few coins and sharing our campaign with your friends, family, and followers!</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Who’s Haunting You</h2>
<p>Season Two of <i>The Way We Haunt Now</i> is written by Courtney Floyd and Georgia P. Mckenzie, with sound design by Brad Colbroock. </p>
<p>The main cast is returning in the following roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Becca Marcus </strong>as Lota Wilson</li>
<li>
<strong>Brad Colbroock</strong> as Cas Bromley</li>
<li>
<strong>Courtney Floyd</strong> as Eulalie Elizabeth Reed</li>
<li>
<strong>Eleanor Grey</strong> as Frankie Summerson</li>
<li>
<strong>Georgia P. Mckenzie</strong> as Josie Callum</li>
<li>
<strong>Jessica Winston</strong> as Alicia Delany</li>
<li>
<strong>Kira Apple</strong> as the Narrator and Mary Bangs</li>
<li>
<strong>Lindsay Zana</strong> as Danny Gutierrez</li>
<li>
<strong>Marnie Warner</strong> as Parker Reed</li>
<li>
<strong>Paul H. Rollins</strong> as Nick Castlewaight</li>
<li>
<strong>Tal Minear</strong> as Myrtle Grayson</li>
</ul>
<p>Kirsty Woolven, Jeff Goldman, Ali Hylton, Natalie Hunter, and Megan Gwen Davies will be returning as voices of The Apartment, and Tim Lowe will be returning as the voice of our resident radio host, Jon Harker. </p>
<p>And they’ll all be joined by a variety of ghosts and ghouls, who we’ll introduce in … clusters? murders? a haunt? (what even is the term for a group of ghosts?!! ) when we hit <strong>10, 30, 50, </strong>and<strong> 70%</strong> of our fundraising goals! (Pssst! One of those announcements will be for a <i>crossover</i>!)</p>
</div><div>
<h2>What You’re Supporting</h2>
<p>Season Two will premiere weekly starting <strong>Saturday, December 4th, 2021</strong>. It will consist of 10 (ten) 20-30 minute episodes, featuring a core cast of <i>twelve characters</i> with 16+ new supporting roles! That’s 3+ hours of delightfully macabre content, featuring the characters you already know and love and plenty more spectral friends to meet along the way.</p>
<p>This season, we’re also bringing on a <strong>talented sound designer</strong> (Brad Colbroock) and <strong>amazing co-writer</strong> (Georgia P. Mckenzie) who have already done so much to make this season shine!</p>
<p>But that’s not all, ghouls! The first episode of our pre-season miniseries, <a href=""https://pnc.st/s/the-way-we-haunt-now/c4b92d91/eulalie-s-audio-journal-entry-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Eulalie’s Audio Journal</i></a>, dropped today. New episodes of the miniseries will drop when we reach 20, 40, 60, and 80% of our fundraising goal!</p>
<p>In addition to miniseries episodes and cast announcements, here’s what you can expect from us during our fundraising campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we reach<strong> 90%</strong>, we’re going to launch a virtual death-poetry salon!</li>
<li>When we’re <strong>100%</strong> funded, we’re going to dress up like ghosts to haunt you – erm, <i>thank you </i> – properly!</li>
</ul>
<p>Our scripts are complete and casting is underway. All we need now is some help to get this haunting off the ground.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Ghoulish Details</h2>
<p>One of our lead writer, Courtney's, favorite authors once said ""We die. That may be the meaning of life. But we do language. That may be the <i>measure</i> of our lives."" (Spoiler: it was Toni Morrison!)</p>
<p>Even though this is a story about ghosts, we hope it's one that provides listeners a way to measure life, to think deeply about what and who matters to them, what narratives might be getting in their way, and how they (you) might find ways to spend your life (and afterlife?) doing what you love with people you love.</p>
<p>We like to think that kind of storytelling, through writing, sound design, and acting, might be worth supporting.</p>
<p>But to give you a sense of what exactly your support will go toward, here's a breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sound design: $2000</strong> (10 episodes, 2 trailers, and script consultation)</li>
<li>
<strong>Returning Core Cast: $3000</strong>  ($30/ep x 10 episodes)</li>
<li>
<strong>Supporting characters: $300</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Co-Writer: $500</strong></li>
<li><strong>Materials: $500</strong></li>
<li><strong>IGG fees: $500</strong></li>
<li><strong>Transcription: $200</strong></li>
<li><strong>Community Management: $300</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For a grand total of<strong> $7,300</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623698793/ozfy2jigzmrn9dsjwxeu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Over 86% of the funds we raise will go directly to the fabulous humans (and ""ghosts"") who bring this story to life. The other ~14% will go to material costs and platform fees.</p>

Season Two will pick up a few weeks after the events of Season One, with Eulalie finally out of the hospital and trying to figure out how to pick up the pieces, our friendly neighborhood ghosts working double time to rescue Frankie from her fate, and our intrepid team of ghost hunters trying to pinpoint what went wrong with their exorcism. 
Along the way, we’ll address the following unfinished business: 

Will Frankie ever be free of the apartment? 
What happens between Eulalie and her lady doctor friend? 
Why does Alicia know so much about this ghost stuff? 
What brought Mary, Josie, and Lota together and what keeps them on this mortal plain? Will the spectral labradoodle ever follow Lota home? 
And, uhhhhh, what is Eulalie gonna do about the fact that she’s suddenly seeing ghosts everywhere???

Help us answer all of these questions–and meet some famous ghosts along the way–by pitching in a few coins and sharing our campaign with your friends, family, and followers!

Who’s Haunting You
Season Two of The Way We Haunt Now is written by Courtney Floyd and Georgia P. Mckenzie, with sound design by Brad Colbroock. 
The main cast is returning in the following roles:


Becca Marcus as Lota Wilson

Brad Colbroock as Cas Bromley

Courtney Floyd as Eulalie Elizabeth Reed

Eleanor Grey as Frankie Summerson

Georgia P. Mckenzie as Josie Callum

Jessica Winston as Alicia Delany

Kira Apple as the Narrator and Mary Bangs

Lindsay Zana as Danny Gutierrez

Marnie Warner as Parker Reed

Paul H. Rollins as Nick Castlewaight

Tal Minear as Myrtle Grayson

Kirsty Woolven, Jeff Goldman, Ali Hylton, Natalie Hunter, and Megan Gwen Davies will be returning as voices of The Apartment, and Tim Lowe will be returning as the voice of our resident radio host, Jon Harker. 
And they’ll all be joined by a variety of ghosts and ghouls, who we’ll introduce in … clusters? murders? a haunt? (what even is the term for a group of ghosts?!! ) when we hit 10, 30, 50, and 70% of our fundraising goals! (Pssst! One of those announcements will be for a crossover!)

What You’re Supporting
Season Two will premiere weekly starting Saturday, December 4th, 2021. It will consist of 10 (ten) 20-30 minute episodes, featuring a core cast of twelve characters with 16+ new supporting roles! That’s 3+ hours of delightfully macabre content, featuring the characters you already know and love and plenty more spectral friends to meet along the way.
This season, we’re also bringing on a talented sound designer (Brad Colbroock) and amazing co-writer (Georgia P. Mckenzie) who have already done so much to make this season shine!
But that’s not all, ghouls! The first episode of our pre-season miniseries, Eulalie’s Audio Journal, dropped today. New episodes of the miniseries will drop when we reach 20, 40, 60, and 80% of our fundraising goal!
In addition to miniseries episodes and cast announcements, here’s what you can expect from us during our fundraising campaign:

When we reach 90%, we’re going to launch a virtual death-poetry salon!
When we’re 100% funded, we’re going to dress up like ghosts to haunt you – erm, thank you  – properly!

Our scripts are complete and casting is underway. All we need now is some help to get this haunting off the ground.

The Ghoulish Details
One of our lead writer, Courtney's, favorite authors once said ""We die. That may be the meaning of life. But we do language. That may be the measure of our lives."" (Spoiler: it was Toni Morrison!)
Even though this is a story about ghosts, we hope it's one that provides listeners a way to measure life, to think deeply about what and who matters to them, what narratives might be getting in their way, and how they (you) might find ways to spend your life (and afterlife?) doing what you love with people you love.
We like to think that kind of storytelling, through writing, sound design, and acting, might be worth supporting.
But to give you a sense of what exactly your support will go toward, here's a breakdown:


Sound design: $2000 (10 episodes, 2 trailers, and script consultation)

Returning Core Cast: $3000  ($30/ep x 10 episodes)

Supporting characters: $300 
Co-Writer: $500
Materials: $500
IGG fees: $500
Transcription: $200
Community Management: $300

For a grand total of $7,300.

Over 86% of the funds we raise will go directly to the fabulous humans (and ""ghosts"") who bring this story to life. The other ~14% will go to material costs and platform fees.
Stretch Goal
$8,500 “The Ghost Hunters” bonus episode, set before the start of season one, in which we follow the You Haint Seen Nothin’ Yet ghost hunting team as they work on (and vlog about) a handful of very Pacific Northwest hauntings.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>We're creating a science fiction audio drama podcast called ROGUEMAKER. ROGUEMAKER is set in the far future, aboard a commercial spaceflight on which something goes horribly wrong, leaving the passengers and crew stranded in escape pods in the vacuum of space! This whodunnit mystery’s got everything from aliens to strange intercepted radio advertisements. Characters include a surly captain, a space botanist, an overly cheerful AI, an astronomer who’s scared of space, [redacted], a band with just the worst luck ever, and a kid who always wanted to be on their favourite TV show and is getting a bit more than they bargained for.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>In More Detail</h3>
<p>We're creating ROGUEMAKER, an independent audio drama podcast. Our show will consist of ten 20-30 minute episodes with a full ensemble cast. To make it happen, we're raising $3,000 to record, edit, and host our show. Some of the money will cover hosting fees, but the majority will go towards paying our hard-working editors, actors, composers, and artists. The script is fully written and undergoing edits, so we'll be ready to start recording just as soon as this campaign and our casting are done! We're so excited to bring you ROGUEMAKER.</p>
<p>ROGUEMAKER explores isolation, existence, dissonance, confronting the past, the consequences of space capitalism, and the importance of taking comfort in music and in each other. It also features fast food restaurants....IN SPACE!, an extremely complicated and long-running future medical soap opera (space opera?), the answer to the age-old question of how do you use the toilet in space, AND original song performances. We will begin casting in fall 2021, and we will release the show in 2022. ROGUEMAKER will be available for free on all major podcasting hosts.</p>
<p>The creator, Emma Johanna Puranen, is a PhD student studying exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) as they appear in science fiction. ROGUEMAKER was born of a time in her life when she felt a bit as if she were adrift in an escape pod herself, and found comfort and connection in audio drama and in 'radio transmissions' received from friends.</p>
<p>Script editor Rook Mogavero is an actor and general theater adult (like a theater kid, but with a degree) who has been helping Emma with ROGUEMAKER since it was a small larp run for a few of their friends. They have stuck to the project like a limpet because they fell in love with its world and characters.</p>
<p>Script editor Shaoni C. White is a writer of speculative fiction and horror. Their work has been published in Podcastle and Uncanny Magazine.</p>
<p>Cover artist <a href=""https://tatyana330.wixsite.com/acezu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tatyana Archtander</a> is a 2D animation bachelor’s student with a background in TTRPG illustration. She can be found on social media as Acezu_art (Instagram) or TheAcezu (Twitter).</p>
<p>Composer Emily Branam is a biologist, actor, and multi-instrumentalist. She works in conservation and habitat restoration and spends her free time making music.</p>
<p>ROGUEMAKER will be our first audio drama production. With our wealth of experience working on audio drama in non-showrunner positions, in theater, and in writing and studying science fiction, we are thrilled to lend our talents to the audio world. We're confident you'll love the result!</p>
<h3>Origin Story</h3>
<p>Before it was a podcast, ROGUEMAKER came into existence as a fully-immersive, audio-only live-action roleplaying experience. Players were cast as passengers or crew of Plutonic Flight 999, a future budget spaceflight company. They spoke to each other in-character from their 'escape pods' over the radio, grappling with the ever-changing situation after the incident onboard their flight, collecting clues to figure out what happened, and occasionally picking up errant radio signals and ads. Dozens of people have played ROGUEMAKER in its live-action roleplaying version, and you can read below about their experiences:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">""You know the sense of ride-or-die solidarity you have for everyone else at the gate of a delayed flight? Prepare to feel that with some of the most endearing and compelling characters imaginable."" - Beck, who played The Botanist</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">""ROGUEMAKER was an incredible experience and a wild ride from start to finish! I’m so excited to hear it turned into podcast form, and to get the chance to experience it all over again and for Emma to be able to share it with the world!"" - Morgan, who played one of The Bandmates</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">""ROGUEMAKER is a richly built world with fascinating characters and hard-hitting moral questions."" - Skylar, who played The Outlaw</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">""Never before have I experienced a story that has so flawlessly integrated the importance of connections, the vast unknowns of space, the resonance of music, and the hilarity of Space McDonalds. This is a podcast you won't want to miss."" - Alexandra, who played one of The Bandmates</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">“As easy as it often is to wonder if anything can really bring people together, ROGUEMAKER reminds us that, sometimes, a kind voice in the dark is all we need.” - Arthur, who played The Flight Attendant</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">""Ever wanted to feel existential about how small you are yet wondrous about how incredibly mysterious space can be? ROGUEMAKER brings it."" - Tatyana, who played one of The Bandmates</p>

The roves will be hosted by fictional characters Jane and Barry.Barry (played by Drew Carlson) is a sentient, hipster, customer-service robot, and Jane (played by Hannah Everett) is an unemployed entrepreneur and the inventor of Barry.The show will be available in 3, accessible formats:
Podcast, available from major podcast streaming platforms
360 Youtube videos, viewable through traditional screens (desktop, laptop, phone, tablet) or through a virtual reality headset (Occulus, Vive, Index, etc.), allowing viewers to view the tour alongside the audio
Blogisodes, written transcripts of the episodes available through our website: www.spectheatre.com

<h3>First Pitch</h3>
<p>Hey, everyone! I'm David Hanna, and along with an amazing cast of voice actors, I'm creating <strong><i>Hand in Glove</i></strong>, an audio drama about romance, queerness, and baseball, which is currently in production.</p>
<p>This show has been a long time in the making, and even though we've just gotten the ball rolling, it's going to be one of the sweetest, loveliest gay romance stories on audio. Plus, there's baseball!</p>
<p>In order to tell this story and make sure our amazing cast and crew can be compensated for their work, though, we need your help. We want to show that people are ready for a wonderful queer baseball romance, and we hope that the success of this campaign will allow us to continue to tell this wonderful story of two baseball players who fall for each other.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Starting Lineup</h3>
<p>We have 2 tiered budget goals for our campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our minimum goal, <u>Tier 1</u>, is set at $3,000.00. This is to cover a base level of costs for the show and to pay our cast for their hard work and dedication.</li>
<li>
<u>Tier 2</u> is set at $4,000.00, which would allow an additional $1,000.00 to bring on a sound designer to help with creating the design to really bring the baseball design to life.</li>
<li>Beyond that, we have plans to continue funding new seasons of the show and possibly some bonus episodes for some of the other awesome characters!</li>
</ul>
<p>The budget plans are subject to change, but we've tried to account for all possible expenses to allow the maximum return to all of the people involved in the show.</p>
<h3>Fan Giveaways</h3>
<p>Of course, donating to the show means you'll get access to some fantastic perks at various levels, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our sincere love and gratitude for being a supporter! ($1)</li>
<li>Early access to episodes and behind-the-scenes news and stories! ($5)</li>
<li>A shout out in each episode of the show! ($10)</li>
<li>A sticker with our amazing logo art! ($25)</li>
<li>The chance to name a baseball team for the show! ($50)</li>
<li>Exclusive baseball cards for the two main characters of the show! ($100)</li>
<li>A custom baseball with show art and a specially-created team logo! ($250)</li>
</ul>
<p>And, if you decide to contribute at the special $2,500.00 level, I, David Hanna, will personally schedule to see a live baseball game with you at the location of your choice, when it is fully safe to do so. Seriously. You name it, I'll be there!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Play the Game</h3>
<p>This show has been in my mind and heart for a couple of years now, and is really special to me personally because it's the first time I've done a creative project in more than a decade. I'm really, really excited to get that chance again.</p>
<p>On a bigger level, too, working on the show and meeting more and more LGBTQIA+ fans of baseball has made me so excited to share a tender, loving MLM romance centered on the sport with both fans of audio drama <i>and</i> fans of baseball. If this show could in a small way help push Baseball to be more open and embracing of its queer fans, we'd be overjoyed.</p>
<p>Finally, with respect to funding, I firmly believe in a sustainable production model that ensures everyone gets paid fairly and transparently for their work. We are starting with modest goals and written agreements with all of our cast and any other contractor working on the show to make sure everyone knows what's happening. Your funding in this project is to not only bring this season to fruition, but to hopefully allow us to do more seasons and more stories for the show, and to reach bigger goals for compensation for everyone working on the show.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With a brand new show like this, one of the potential risks is failure to finish the project. We can guarantee that will never be an issue.</p>
<p>Early on, we set up an informal email newsletter process to ensure that everyone in the cast, whether a lead or appearing in one scene, is always kept in the loop on the progress of the show. For all supporters at the $5 or greater level, we will offer a similar newsletter service to let you know the status of production, issues we're encountering, fun stories or background, and maybe some baseball musings or two.</p>
<p>Another risk is funding - what if we can't reach our Tier 1 goal? If we can't pay what we'd like to for the process?</p>
<p>If we aren't able to reach our Tier 1 goal, we will pay all costs related to the show, followed by an agreed percentage to the actors, and we will make some evaluations as to whether we can continue. The funding for the show will be distributed first to any direct costs of the show's campaign, and then to the actors at a rate commensurate to our planned budget.</p>
<p>Finally, we have a set of Diversity &amp; Inclusion, Safety, and Harassment policies in place, and are currently working on an Accessibility Policy to share once it's drafted, reviewed, and approved by me and our cast. Having worked in theater in the past, I can say that the only place that we can create is a safe place, and we will always work to ensure our table reads, discussions, and production is conducted in a professional, safe, and inclusive manner. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that not everyone can contribute financially at this time, but we'd still love it if you can help!</p>
<p>First, follow our show on Twitter or Instagram, where we'll be sharing information about the show, the campaign, and maybe some fun daily perks for the show!</p>
<p>Then, if you have someone you know that you think would love the show, please send them a link to our campaign! Sharing the campaign is just as important as contributing, and I'll be thinking of some lovely ways to shout out people who can help us spread the word.</p>

Helmed by pagan creators, the show features characters inspired by Norse Mythology—gods, valkyries, dwarves, and eight-legged horses—written from the perspective of people who incorporate those figures into their real religious practice. It deals with themes of found family, trauma, grief, and the complicated side of forgiveness: what do you do when someone you love hurts you more than you ever could have imagined?

A breakdown of where the money is going:</p><p><u><strong>Actors: $2,220</strong></u></p><p>We have a cast of 20 actors (not including the creators of the show, who are also voicing two characters). Our primary and secondary actors are paid at a rate of $25/ep; our featured actors are paid at a rate of $20/ep. </p><p><u><strong>Sound Designer: $1,000</strong></u></p><p>We're paying our sound designer, Cole Burkhardt, $100/ep.</p><p><u><strong>Director: $300</strong></u></p><p>We're paying our director, A.R. Olivieri, $30/ep. This compensates both the work that they do directing episodes and the various work they've done through the pre-production process.</p><p><u><strong>Music: $200</strong></u></p><p>We're paying our composer, Lavender, $100 for our theme song as well as some background music in one episode. We're also paying our violinist, Kofi Young, $150 for our end credits music and music in another episode.</p><p><u><strong>Perks: $500</strong></u></p><p>This is what we're estimating we'll need to spend on the materials, packing, and shipping for the physical perks we're sending out.</p><p><u><strong>Indiegogo Fees: $350</strong></u></p><p>This is what we're estimating we'll need to set aside for the pesky fees that Indiegogo charges.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615849454/y21h9fdzy2wlovc67swk.png"" src=""""/></p><h2>Stretch Goals</h2><p>Once we hit our initial goal, we have some fun stretch goals!</p><p><u><strong>$5,230 — Drunk Mythology</strong></u></p><p>The initial goal for our crowdfund does not include any payment for the show creators, Nick and Cassie. If we reach this goal, Nick and Cassie will be paid for their work on the show, which includes writing the story, writing and editing the scripts, casting the show, creating the website, creating all art, running the production, editing the episode audio, and acting in the show (among other things that we're probably forgetting).</p><p>As thanks for reaching this goal, we'll create a video (possibly livestreamed, details TBD) where Cassie—our resident autistic nerd who's had a special interest in Norse Mythology since high school—will get drunk and humorously summarize some of the original myths that make up Norse Mythology.</p><p><u><strong>$7,000 — Bonus Mini Episodes: Timeskip Edition</strong></u></p><p>One of the episodes in season one features a timeskip of several months.

Learn a little more about the history of the characters and how they became the people they are today.</p><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2><p>This is a very low-risk crowdfund: the first season is already in production and we have ways to fund the production out of pocket if absolutely needed. If the crowdfund fails, the show will still be made, though rewards may take a little longer to go out!</p><h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2><p>If you're interested in the show but can't afford to donate to us, we completely understand!

</ul><p>From the entire cast and crew of Twilight Over Midgard...</p><h2>Thank you for your support!</h2></div>","What would you do if the world was ending?October 2017. Seattle, Washington. Reese Belmont, a Norse Pagan, is distraught after his god, Baldr, stops talking to him. He and his friend Morgan Daley attempt to figure out what happened and come to a horrifying conclusion: Baldr is dead. A week later, snow begins to fall—earlier than either of them can remember seeing it come to Seattle.December 2020. Winter has gone on without stop for the past three years. And now, the world is being plagued by natural disasters—earthquakes, tsunamis, wildfires. As Morgan slowly begins to suspect what’s happening, somebody arrives to confirm her fears.Sigyn, the Norse Goddess of Loyalty, arrives with horrible news: Ragnarök—the apocalypse—is on its way. And Sigyn and her wife, Loki, want Morgan, Reese, and their friends to stop it.If the world was ending, what would you sacrifice to save it?OverviewTwilight Over Midgard is a modern fantasy audio drama (fiction podcast) about a group of friends in Seattle who are recruited by two Norse gods to stop the apocalypse. The show is created by a queer production team with a cast composed entirely of queer characters. Helmed by pagan creators, the show features characters inspired by Norse Mythology—gods, valkyries, dwarves, and eight-legged horses—written from the perspective of people who incorporate those figures into their real religious practice. It deals with themes of found family, trauma, grief, and the complicated side of forgiveness: what do you do when someone you love hurts you more than you ever could have imagined? How do you forgive them? Do you forgive them at all?Read more about our show:

<h3>The Why</h3>
<p>Black, Brown &amp; Queer and Trans People of Color (QTPOC) folks deserve a space where their art is centered. Life attempts to put us in boxes and limit us to particular labels, but inside The Qube we are three-dimensional. We are showing our depth &amp; breathe by speaking our truth, sharing our wisdom, and spreading our joy through music &amp; podcasts. The Qube will be a place for people to be inspired by the various ways Black, Brown, QTPOC people show up in the world.</p>
<h3>
<br/>The Story</h3>
<p>For the past two years, Anna DeShawn &amp; the E3 Radio team have been dreaming, planning, and now executing the development of The Qube. Anna says, ""Two years ago we knew that we had to create an app to make it easier for folks to listen to the station. Through conversation it was clear we had to include podcasts as part of the experience. Podcasts are radio 2.0 but it's incredibly difficult to find good ones. This app is something we wanted to see in the world so we decided to create it"".  The E3 Radio team has put a plan in place to fuel this dream and now they need your help. </p>
<h3>
<br/>The Facts</h3>
<p>There are three inequalities the E3 team are seeking to address; ownership, visibility, and financial equity.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Qube is powered by E3 Radio, which is majority owned by a Black Queer woman. The team is composed of Black LGBTQ business owners, advisors, and champions. </li>
<li>E3 Radio has  been providing Queer POC a platform to be seen &amp; heard for over a decade. The Qube is a natural evolution of that work. </li>
<li>The Qube will offer a revenue sharing program and tipping functionality to compensate podcast creatives for their work. </li>
</ul>
<h3>
<br/>The Process</h3>
<p>Every podcast that lives inside of The Qube is listened to by our podcasting listening team. They use our Qubric as their guide to score each piece of content. Our Qubric values content, production quality, the delivery and other important elements that make up a good podcast. We want to curate the best podcasts by Black, Brown, &amp; QTPOC creatives. </p>

Black, Brown & Queer and Trans People of Color (QTPOC) folks deserve a space where their art is centered. Life attempts to put us in boxes and limit us to particular labels, but inside The Qube we are three-dimensional. We are showing our depth & breathe by speaking our truth, sharing our wisdom, and spreading our joy through music & podcasts. The Qube will be a place for people to be inspired by the various ways Black, Brown, QTPOC people show up in the world.

The Story
For the past two years, Anna DeShawn & the E3 Radio team have been dreaming, planning, and now executing the development of The Qube. Anna says, ""Two years ago we knew that we had to create an app to make it easier for folks to listen to the station. Through conversation it was clear we had to include podcasts as part of the experience. Podcasts are radio 2.0 but it's incredibly difficult to find good ones. This app is something we wanted to see in the world so we decided to create it"".  The E3 Radio team has put a plan in place to fuel this dream and now they need your help. 

The Facts
There are three inequalities the E3 team are seeking to address; ownership, visibility, and financial equity.

The Qube is powered by E3 Radio, which is majority owned by a Black Queer woman. The team is composed of Black LGBTQ business owners, advisors, and champions. 
E3 Radio has  been providing Queer POC a platform to be seen & heard for over a decade. The Qube is a natural evolution of that work. 
The Qube will offer a revenue sharing program and tipping functionality to compensate podcast creatives for their work. 


The Process
Every podcast that lives inside of The Qube is listened to by our podcasting listening team. They use our Qubric as their guide to score each piece of content. Our Qubric values content, production quality, the delivery and other important elements that make up a good podcast. We want to curate the best podcasts by Black, Brown, & QTPOC creatives.

<h3>We Out Here! </h3>
<p>Allison Jones and I (Alexi Grousis) are scientific communicators and performers who have spent years sharing our passion about wildlife with audiences around the US. As Black communicators in the sciences we've seen few folks like ourselves in both the lab, the field, and in nature; that is, until 2020 when the Hashtag #BlackInNature popped off showing Black faces in outdoor spaces. Now we want to meet all y'all and many more!</p>
<p>We Out Here is a nine episode (per season) podcast, where we are joined by a guest and explore their work or passion, learning about their experiences in the wild. Guests will range from Black nonbinary rock climbers to Native scientists. WOH (We Out Here) paints a multi-faceted picture of the American experience, from the remote North American wilds to the urban backyard through story-telling. The program uses the personal experiences of their guests as a vehicle for connecting their audience to those whose work or passion center around nature. This is the ever-present diversity among those devoted to our planet.</p>

<h3>What Is Orbituary?</h3>
<p>Orbituary is a monthly audio drama that is written, produced, and acted by a predominantly LGBTQ cast and crew. It's expected to be released in March 2022. </p>
<p>It's a modern Frankenstein retelling centered around what actually happened on the USS Prometheus, a deep space station that went radio silent eight years ago. Join newscaster RJ Walton as he sifts through recordings, letters, and logs that detail the strange and miraculous story of the crew. There will be gay pining, big moral questions, not so subtle metaphors, and dark humor.</p>
<p>It will be 23 episodes that run between 20 and 30 minutes. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Do We Need Crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>Simply speaking: This project is run by a college student making just above minimum wage. I have the funds to back this project, but it's coming out of my personal savings. I would much prefer to have a little help with the costs.</p>
<p>The funding goes directly to the team of actors and script editor. The actors are getting paid $15 per recorded hour and the script editor is getting paid $10 per hour. We currently have seven actors and one script editor.</p>
<p>Any excess funding will go to bonus episodes first and website and podcast hosting second.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Currently there is very little risk. The episodes are written, and we have a full cast. The only foreseeable risk is the possibility of not meeting the March 2022 deadline, as scheduling conflicts may arise, or audio editing may take longer than anticipated.</p>
<p>Regardless, Orbituary will be completed. </p>

<h2>What We're Creating</h2>
<p><strong><a href=""http://nosuchthingradio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">No Such Thing</a></strong> is an independent production company, dedicated to creating and sharing new works of audio drama fiction, and the development of strange new worlds through the power of storytelling. We create stories, set in the wildest corners of the universe, to explore just what it means to be human. <strong><i>Descendants</i></strong> is a two-season limited series science-fiction adventure/thriller, and the sequel of No Such Thing's first series, <i><a href=""http://nosuchthingradio.com/janus-descending"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Janus Descending</strong></a></i>. Written by Jordan Cobb, with sound design by Julia Schifini and Hemlock Creek Productions, and music by Daryl Banner, the first season of Descendants, <i>Book One: Inheritance</i>, will be comprised of eight (8) episodes, each approximately 20 minutes in length.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell you how long I have waited for this. We’ve been waiting for years to tell this story, because we wanted to be sure we gave it our absolute best shot,” Cobb explains. “As a team, we’ve learned a lot since creating <i>Janus Descending</i>. <i>Descendants</i> was written almost immediately after we finished the first series, but it took over a year to complete and since then we’ve just been refining, trying to see how we could twist and shape this world and give you something new. This series originally started as a mini-series, and now we’ve got two whole seasons to record! Both seasons are already written in full, it’s just a matter of launching them into their proverbial orbits, so to speak. While we decided against repeating the same crossing storylines format as <i>Janus Descending</i> – ultimately, it didn’t fit the narrative we’re trying to tell here – returning audience members will find the same character driven, eyes-on-the-stars storytelling we always strive to create here at No Such Thing Productions. Old friends, new beginnings. That’s what sequels are all about.”</p>
<p><i><strong>The story begins</strong></i> where <i>Janus Descending</i> left off, at our lost crew’s nightmarish homecoming, and follows Peter’s older brother, Axel, through the aftermath of the Janus Disaster. Three days after the wreckage of the Adamantine was found, crashed on the barren plains of the Rosseter Moon Colony, the remains of the missing ship were brought back to Aphelion Industries. But something survived the crash, and now, it's beginning to spread. As the Gorgons begin their rampage to consume and multiply, Axel, Captain Rori, and the ARC Juno team must fight their way out of the quarantined facilities, and find a way to stay alive... but in doing so, they just might damn their world...</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p><strong><a href=""http://jordanvcobb.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jordan Cobb</a></strong> is the creator of <i>Descendants</i>, as well as the voice of Chel, and Official Multiple Hat Wearer of No Such Thing Productions (Head Writer, Director, Producer, etc). As both a writer and an actress, she spends the majority of her time dreaming up new worlds, and doing everything she can to bring them to life. Now, she's poking her head out of her nest of paper and ink, with yet another story to tell, and the fervent hope that you'll join her for the adventure...</p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://juliaschifini.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Julia Schifini</a></strong> is our award winning sound designer extraordinaire, and has spent many eons communing with the dark and mysterious entities living at the edge of our universe, learning from them the secrets she uses to craft our wild and vivid soundscapes. Her work with No Such Thing Productions' includes sound designing for <i>Primordial Deep</i> and <i>Janus Descending</i>.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://darylbanner.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Daryl Banner</a></strong> is our award winning composer, and his carefully crafted scores bring depth and color into our stories, and hang the constellations our imaginary skies. <i>Descendants</i> is the fourth of Jordan's projects he has helped bring to life, and he has been professionally composing music and writing his series of adult novels, full time since college.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.hemlockcreekprod.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hemlock Creek Productions</a></strong>, the boutique audio studio, will be joining the No Such Thing Productions team for the first time, in a collaboration that is sure to be out of this world. Marisa Ewing and her team will be putting the mastery in mixing and mastering the initial dialogue for the series, and we could not be more thrilled to be adding their family to ours for this story!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How Can I Help? (Funding Breakdown)</h2>
<p>We at No Such Thing Productions want to be able to provide you with stories you can carry throughout a lifetime. We're aiming high with the hopes that the better we treat our cast and crew, the better our stories will be when we give them back to you -- because these stories belong to you, our friends and dear listeners, and without you they wouldn't exist. Come join us on an adventure! With your help, we're building not just a world, but a full and vibrant universe.</p>
<p>So if you're wondering where exactly all this money is about to go... here's the breakdown:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our primary goal is to be able to pay all of our phenomenal actors. We've got a cast of about eighteen people, and we want to make sure they're fairly compensated!</p>
<p><u>Main Cast:</u> $50 x episode = $1,300</p>
<p><u>Featured Supporting Cast:</u> $40 x episode = $480</p>
<p><u>Ensemble actors and Bonus Episodes:</u> $25 x appearance = $900</p>
<p>29% of this campaign will be going to all of these incredible people who help to bring this story to life! To cover our actor fees, we need to raise $2,680.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Next, we're setting aside funds for the people who physically knit this world together, including our:</p>
<p><u>Sound Design:</u> $2,900</p>
<p><u>Composer:</u> $400</p>
<p><u>Writer/Director:</u> $1,500</p>
<p>That's 53% or $4,800 for our tireless crew of misfits and world builders!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And finally, we're setting aside $1,620 (or 18%) to cover some of our basic production costs like hosting our RSS feed, maintaining our website, all the miscellaneous things that inevitably go sideways during production, and of course, the 5% that IndieGoGo charges for hosting this campaign!</p>
<p>All in all, that brings us to <strong>a grand total of $9,100!</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1624641658/boymttc3bvdqf8zlcwpn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Stretch Goal</h3>
<p>We're hoping against hope that we hit our goal. But if we manage to exceed it, never fear! We'll use those funds to make this world even bigger and better, by sharing EVEN MORE OF IT with you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>$12,000 – Final Stand:</strong></i> You like us! You REALLY like us!! If we reach our first stretch goal, we'll create <strong><i>a Special Two-Part Bonus episode for Descendants</i></strong>, to air after the finale of Season One!</p>
<p><i><strong>$20,000 – Red Planet:</strong></i> It’s the beginning of The End! If we reach this zenith of all stretch goals, we'll have <strong><i>funded BOTH SEASONS of Descendants</i></strong>! Which means you get <i>Part Two: Red Planet</i> all the sooner!</p>
<p> </p>

<p>We wouldn't be able to create the stories that we do if we didn't have such a fantastic base of supporters.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Your support in all its forms means the world to us.</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Thank you for joining us in this adventure!</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">We can't wait to share this story with you...</h3>
</div></div>","What We're Creating
No Such Thing is an independent production company, dedicated to creating and sharing new works of audio drama fiction, and the development of strange new worlds through the power of storytelling. We create stories, set in the wildest corners of the universe, to explore just what it means to be human. Descendants is a two-season limited series science-fiction adventure/thriller, and the sequel of No Such Thing's first series, Janus Descending. Written by Jordan Cobb, with sound design by Julia Schifini and Hemlock Creek Productions, and music by Daryl Banner, the first season of Descendants, Book One: Inheritance, will be comprised of eight (8) episodes, each approximately 20 minutes in length.
“I can’t tell you how long I have waited for this. We’ve been waiting for years to tell this story, because we wanted to be sure we gave it our absolute best shot,” Cobb explains. “As a team, we’ve learned a lot since creating Janus Descending. Descendants was written almost immediately after we finished the first series, but it took over a year to complete and since then we’ve just been refining, trying to see how we could twist and shape this world and give you something new. This series originally started as a mini-series, and now we’ve got two whole seasons to record! Both seasons are already written in full, it’s just a matter of launching them into their proverbial orbits, so to speak. While we decided against repeating the same crossing storylines format as Janus Descending – ultimately, it didn’t fit the narrative we’re trying to tell here – returning audience members will find the same character driven, eyes-on-the-stars storytelling we always strive to create here at No Such Thing Productions. Old friends, new beginnings. That’s what sequels are all about.”
The story begins where Janus Descending left off, at our lost crew’s nightmarish homecoming, and follows Peter’s older brother, Axel, through the aftermath of the Janus Disaster. Three days after the wreckage of the Adamantine was found, crashed on the barren plains of the Rosseter Moon Colony, the remains of the missing ship were brought back to Aphelion Industries. But something survived the crash, and now, it's beginning to spread. As the Gorgons begin their rampage to consume and multiply, Axel, Captain Rori, and the ARC Juno team must fight their way out of the quarantined facilities, and find a way to stay alive... but in doing so, they just might damn their world...
 
Who We Are
Jordan Cobb is the creator of Descendants, as well as the voice of Chel, and Official Multiple Hat Wearer of No Such Thing Productions (Head Writer, Director, Producer, etc). As both a writer and an actress, she spends the majority of her time dreaming up new worlds, and doing everything she can to bring them to life. Now, she's poking her head out of her nest of paper and ink, with yet another story to tell, and the fervent hope that you'll join her for the adventure...
Julia Schifini is our award winning sound designer extraordinaire, and has spent many eons communing with the dark and mysterious entities living at the edge of our universe, learning from them the secrets she uses to craft our wild and vivid soundscapes. Her work with No Such Thing Productions' includes sound designing for Primordial Deep and Janus Descending.
Daryl Banner is our award winning composer, and his carefully crafted scores bring depth and color into our stories, and hang the constellations our imaginary skies. Descendants is the fourth of Jordan's projects he has helped bring to life, and he has been professionally composing music and writing his series of adult novels, full time since college.
Hemlock Creek Productions, the boutique audio studio, will be joining the No Such Thing Productions team for the first time, in a collaboration that is sure to be out of this world. Marisa Ewing and her team will be putting the mastery in mixing and mastering the initial dialogue for the series, and we could not be more thrilled to be adding their family to ours for this story!
 
How Can I Help? (Funding Breakdown)
We at No Such Thing Productions want to be able to provide you with stories you can carry throughout a lifetime. We're aiming high with the hopes that the better we treat our cast and crew, the better our stories will be when we give them back to you -- because these stories belong to you, our friends and dear listeners, and without you they wouldn't exist. Come join us on an adventure! With your help, we're building not just a world, but a full and vibrant universe.
So if you're wondering where exactly all this money is about to go... here's the breakdown:
 
Our primary goal is to be able to pay all of our phenomenal actors. We've got a cast of about eighteen people, and we want to make sure they're fairly compensated!
Main Cast: $50 x episode = $1,300
Featured Supporting Cast: $40 x episode = $480
Ensemble actors and Bonus Episodes: $25 x appearance = $900
29% of this campaign will be going to all of these incredible people who help to bring this story to life! To cover our actor fees, we need to raise $2,680.
 
Next, we're setting aside funds for the people who physically knit this world together, including our:
Sound Design: $2,900
Composer: $400
Writer/Director: $1,500
That's 53% or $4,800 for our tireless crew of misfits and world builders!
 
And finally, we're setting aside $1,620 (or 18%) to cover some of our basic production costs like hosting our RSS feed, maintaining our website, all the miscellaneous things that inevitably go sideways during production, and of course, the 5% that IndieGoGo charges for hosting this campaign!
All in all, that brings us to a grand total of $9,100!

 
Stretch Goal
We're hoping against hope that we hit our goal. But if we manage to exceed it, never fear! We'll use those funds to make this world even bigger and better, by sharing EVEN MORE OF IT with you!
 
$12,000 – Final Stand: You like us! You REALLY like us!! If we reach our first stretch goal, we'll create a Special Two-Part Bonus episode for Descendants, to air after the finale of Season One!
$20,000 – Red Planet: It’s the beginning of The End! If we reach this zenith of all stretch goals, we'll have funded BOTH SEASONS of Descendants! Which means you get Part Two: Red Planet all the sooner!

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for $7,000 to help with operational costs (website hosting, podcast hosting, remote interview software, editing software, etc.) as well as things like music licensing, travel costs for field recordings, and the time it takes us to produce high-quality content (it takes a lot of time!).</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Upstream is an invaluable resource to change-makers and those who are interested in learning about alternative forms of organizing an economy. Our documentaries reach tens of thousands of listeners, have been featured on numerous public and college radio stations nationally and internationally and have been featured in high school and college course curricula.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some quotes from a few of our long-time listeners:</strong></p>
<p><i>“The stories, ideas, and inequalities that Upstream has illuminated have awakened a fervor in me...a deeper desire for change. My roommates and I are starting a monthly dinner/discussion that centers around your podcast.” - Rachel, an Upstream listener</i></p>
<p><i>""The amazing team at Upstream podcast have pulled together the most brilliant walk through 'Economics' as we live it, rather than how we theorise it. Facts and theories aren't lacking, but they're not used as a distance-r; in other words, I'm sharing this with you because I think it will resonate... 'I'm sharing it in case it can add rocket fuel to ways you are already living or working, or as an extra motivator to pursue the economy you want to see. I imagine some of you will have found your way to it already, but I didn't want to risk you missing it!"" - Lydia Catterall, artist, collaborator, listener, researcher + connector based in Leeds, UK</i></p>
<p><i>""The combination of storytelling and economic analysis is where Upstream excels. Their episodes are powerful because they are successful at breathing life into an otherwise cold and incomprehensible economic system. Their ability to blur the lines between the field of economics and the art of storytelling leaves you unsuspecting of the fact that you’re actually listening to a podcast categorized under 'economics.'"" - Laurie Walmsley, Podcast Reviews.org</i></p>

<h3>The Issue</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Seun Shokunbi, Principal Consultant and Founder of Karfi. My team and I have experience in business development in both the for-profit and nonprofit sector. As a child of Nigerian immigrants, I'm also extremely passionate about Africa's role in the global economy. I'm launching this campaign with a solution to the following issues crippling socioeconomic advancement on the continent:</p>
<ul>
<li>high youth unemployment rates</li>
<li>limited job creation</li>
<li>high inflation rates</li>
<li>rising costs of doing business in and sending remittances to Africa</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>The Karfi Mobile App will launch in 2019, and we’re looking for strategic partners who believe in our vision of democratizing entrepreneurship, for the economic benefit of Africa. This is a unique opportunity to empower underemployed Africans who, notwithstanding their socioeconomic and educational background, would start businesses that promote job creation and innovation in their local communities.</p>
<p><strong>Funding needed:</strong></p>
<p>We need at least $700 in initial funding to start covering the costs of coding the application. We already have a signed agreement with a reputable developer  to build this platform. Additionally, a portion of funding (~20-30%) will be allocated to advertising the product via Google and paid social media campaigns.</p>
<p><b>The perks:</b></p>
<p>For our earliest investors, we'd love to reward you with the following perks - </p>
<ul>
<li>your name mentioned on our website as an early investor</li>
<li>a donation in your name (in the amount of 20% of entire funds raised) to<i> <a href=""http://www.africanwomenresearchers.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">African Research Academies for Women (ARA-W)</a></i>, one of our clients and earliest supporters of our webinar sessions for African entrepreneurs</li>
<li>an opportunity to purchase equity stake in company (more details provided once campaign goal is met)</li>
<li>
<u><strong>referral perk</strong></u>: the contributor who refers the most people to this campaign will receive a gift card to the restaurant of their choice.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where funding will go:</strong></p>
<p>While we're SUPER confident we will hit our target, any funding we do obtain will go strictly towards paying the fees necessary for developing the mobile app, regardless of whether we reach our stated goal.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Entrepreneurship is a vital solution to the issues highlighted earlier, because of the financial and professional independence it affords, and its potential to create new jobs for others who may not become gainfully employed due to (a) skills mismatch, or (b) economic barriers. For the Diaspora community, limited options based on immigration status (e.g. companies unwilling to sponsor work visas) can also prevent Africans from attaining jobs with higher wage potential, which may mean longer work hours with very little pay.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship programs recruiting participants from emerging economies do exist – some using highly selective criteria to determine who enrolls. However, not every startup founder will be an Echoing Green, Obama Foundation, or Clinton Global Initiative finalists (to name a few). That should not immediately disqualify them from becoming an entrepreneur, nor does it mean their ideas or businesses should not receive the support needed to scale strategically and sustainably.</p>
<p>Karfi envisions the democratization of the entrepreneurial space through equal opportunity and equal access to information. With our mobile app, webinars, eBooks, and more will be available for instant streaming/download, and networking with other Karfi members and experts will be possible 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Within one month of our launch, 2,000+ unique visitors were interacting with content through our website from their cell phones. The Karfi Mobile App will make it much easier for them to access our library of content.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any business venture, there are risks.

</div></div>","The Issue
Hi! I'm Seun Shokunbi, Principal Consultant and Founder of Karfi. My team and I have experience in business development in both the for-profit and nonprofit sector. As a child of Nigerian immigrants, I'm also extremely passionate about Africa's role in the global economy. I'm launching this campaign with a solution to the following issues crippling socioeconomic advancement on the continent:

high youth unemployment rates
limited job creation
high inflation rates
rising costs of doing business in and sending remittances to Africa

 

The Solution
The Karfi Mobile App will launch in 2019, and we’re looking for strategic partners who believe in our vision of democratizing entrepreneurship, for the economic benefit of Africa. This is a unique opportunity to empower underemployed Africans who, notwithstanding their socioeconomic and educational background, would start businesses that promote job creation and innovation in their local communities.
Funding needed:
We need at least $700 in initial funding to start covering the costs of coding the application. We already have a signed agreement with a reputable developer  to build this platform. Additionally, a portion of funding (~20-30%) will be allocated to advertising the product via Google and paid social media campaigns.
The perks:
For our earliest investors, we'd love to reward you with the following perks - 

your name mentioned on our website as an early investor
a donation in your name (in the amount of 20% of entire funds raised) to African Research Academies for Women (ARA-W), one of our clients and earliest supporters of our webinar sessions for African entrepreneurs
an opportunity to purchase equity stake in company (more details provided once campaign goal is met)

referral perk: the contributor who refers the most people to this campaign will receive a gift card to the restaurant of their choice.

Where funding will go:
While we're SUPER confident we will hit our target, any funding we do obtain will go strictly towards paying the fees necessary for developing the mobile app, regardless of whether we reach our stated goal.
 

The Impact
Entrepreneurship is a vital solution to the issues highlighted earlier, because of the financial and professional independence it affords, and its potential to create new jobs for others who may not become gainfully employed due to (a) skills mismatch, or (b) economic barriers. For the Diaspora community, limited options based on immigration status (e.g. companies unwilling to sponsor work visas) can also prevent Africans from attaining jobs with higher wage potential, which may mean longer work hours with very little pay.
Entrepreneurship programs recruiting participants from emerging economies do exist – some using highly selective criteria to determine who enrolls. However, not every startup founder will be an Echoing Green, Obama Foundation, or Clinton Global Initiative finalists (to name a few). That should not immediately disqualify them from becoming an entrepreneur, nor does it mean their ideas or businesses should not receive the support needed to scale strategically and sustainably.
Karfi envisions the democratization of the entrepreneurial space through equal opportunity and equal access to information. With our mobile app, webinars, eBooks, and more will be available for instant streaming/download, and networking with other Karfi members and experts will be possible 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Within one month of our launch, 2,000+ unique visitors were interacting with content through our website from their cell phones. The Karfi Mobile App will make it much easier for them to access our library of content.
 

Risks & Challenges
As with any business venture, there are risks. In the case of Karfi, we've already proven our relevance with over 2,000 site visitors in just the first month of launching our signature IRON Series Webinar. We've also seen 65% of our traffic come from mobile phones, which makes us very confident that an app would sell itself easily to our target customers.
However, there's no 100% guarantee that the same volume of users will download the application right away. It will take a significant investment in advertising and promotion to get the word out to over 900 million young adults within our target range of potential users.
Google Adwords is largely responsible for getting us over similar hurdles for our website, and we've received over 2,800 impressions on LinkedIn alone for social shares of our content (e.g. posts shared by the experts who have been guests on our webinar/podcast sessions). There's still a long list of contributors who have signed up to support this cause, and so we're extremely confident that with our social clout and strategic marketing, we can eliminate many of the risks involved in launching this project.

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>We are Hannah &amp; Sarah – two comedy podcasters based in Minneapolis, MN. We share a love of puns, media analysis, Brad Pitt, and taking jokes entirely too far. In February 2017, March Bradness was born. We learned Brad Pitt has starred in enough movies to fill out an entire basketball bracket, so we decided to watch them all in a battle of elimination.</p>
<p>At this point, we're over halfway through the bracket – and we're nearing the end of our first season. This isn't our first time tracking down a Brad Pitt film. We bought the last copy of <i>The Image</i> off Amazon; we had to get a VHS player to watch <i>Happy Together</i>, which never made it to DVD; and we've snagged dozens of hard-to-find movies at various record stores.</p>
<p>But there's one Brad Pitt film we can't watch without your help.</p>
<p>Contact is a 1992 short film directed by Jonathan Darby, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. The short film has not been digitized, is not for sale, and is <i>only</i> available for in-person screening at the Academy in Los Angeles. This is the last film in our bracket for season one, and we can't watch it without your help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>March Bradness Goes to LA</h3>
<p>We've been invited to screen the film at the Academy in October. We currently cover all podcast funds ourselves – which includes equipment, web hosting, podcast hosting, advertising, and DVDs – as well as the time and labor that is involved in recording and editing each episode. We would love your help in recouping the cost of flights to LA. There's no length we won't go to for Brad Pitt; but we would be much happier, healthier and able to focus on producing a stellar season finale if we didn't have to break the bank to make it happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>A Stellar Season Finale</h3>
<p>If we're able to reach our goals, the film will take its rightful place in the bracket, and we will secure our position as the world's first and foremost Brad Pitt scholars. Our review of Contact will be featured in our season finale, and we will evaluate the film based on Brad Pitt's performance.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your help and support. If you can't donate, please help us out by telling your friends about us and giving us those sweet, sweet stars on iTunes. We <i>really</i> appreciate the support we've been shown thus far; it means the world to have you guys on board with this runaway pun.</p>
<p>Stay Braddy!</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Shadows of a Dark Past is an original gothic horror podcast, the brainchild of writer, director, and voice actor, Ando Valentine. It’s a dark, atmospheric, unsettling, dramatic, and even romantic tribute to the 1966 Dan Curtis cult classic TV show “Dark Shadows.” As a teenager who was particularly fascinated with things ""before his time,"" Ando wrote a 300-page-long fanfiction set in the <i>Dark Shadows</i> universe... This was the genesis of <strong>Shadows of a Dark Past</strong>. </p>
<p>After consulting with brilliant voice actors and the Atlanta Radio Theater Company, Ando set out to bring a dream to life. From 2018 to 2019, Ando wrote, cast, recorded and directed the first season with the help of talent who were willing to invest countless hours in bringing to life the Clayton Family.</p>
<p>The plans in place already reach as far as a third season, and the audio engineering of the <i>first</i> season is already in progress. That's where <strong>you</strong> come in. We would be honored if you helped us bring Shadows of a Dark Past's first season <i>to the public</i>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>While the first season was approached as a labor of love, there are some real-world hurdles to overcome. These include hosting for the show, advertising and marketing to spread the word, and compensating the amazing performances put in by the talented cast of voice actors.</p>
<p>Our goal for this campaign is <strong>$1,000</strong>. Where will that money go? Aside from Indiegogo fees, here are our intended uses for the funding:</p>
<ul>
<li>One year's worth of file hosting. This is a service where the audio files will live and enable not only streaming access from our website but also easy submission to podcast directories like iTunes, Google Play, Stitcher, Spotify, etc.</li>
<li>One year of IMDb Pro. This will allow our<i> </i>cast members to list their role in Shadows of a Dark Past on IMDb and therefore receive due credit for the incredible talent they invested in the project.</li>
<li>Digital advertisements and marketing materials, to spread the word about the podcast to our (luckily!) existing audience.</li>
<li>Well-earned compensation to the voice actors for the time and effort they donated to the first season.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything above our goal will expand the voice actors' compensation and increase our advertising to grow our audience even larger! If we do not meet our goal, know that we will still choose to compensate our incredible voice actors, even at the expense of some of the less-vital items.</p>
<p>For your support, any and all backers, no matter the level, you will receive access to the <i><strong>entire first season</strong></i> as soon as we are ready to publish the first episode, so you can binge it or listen at your own pace! The more support you are willing to provide, the more awesome your perks will be, ranging from a physical CD containing the first season and exclusive behind-the-scenes content to physical merch, a signed poster, and a video shout-out from the cast!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While <strong>Shadows of a Dark Past</strong> is primarily entertainment, there is a notable measure of wisdom nestled amongst the tales of vampires and ghosts. The cast and crew of Shadows of a Dark Past believe firmly in <i><strong>love and acceptance, the importance of family,</strong></i> and <i><strong>taking care of those we love</strong></i>. We are excited to demonstrate these truths through (though magical) <i>relatable </i>characters and dynamic storylines. We believe we can provide <i>entertaining action and drama</i> in perfect harmony with impactful messages. You can help us send those messages, <i>loud and clear</i>!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While nothing is entirely risk-free, the risk of creating an immersive podcast for which we know the audience exists are <i>minimal</i>. The first season has already been recorded, and is in post-production. This work will happen regardless. The <i>biggest</i> risk is not even raising enough to fund the hosting. We feel that is a risk well-worth taking.</p>
<p>As far as challenges go, this is a <i><strong>brand new podcast</strong></i>, being produced by an as-yet-unknown creative team. The challenges all revolve around attracting our audience of devoted listeners. But between the professional actors we have already attracted and a marketing plan to increase our visibility with our biggest target demographic, these challenges are absolutely surmountable. We have high confidence that they will not keep us down!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you aren't able to make a donation, we would be honored if you simply <strong>spread the word</strong>! Sharing this campaign—and details about our podcast itself—with your friends and circles is just as valuable as every dollar we earn! If you know of a person or company who might be willing to sponsor us directly, let us know!

<p>Each project requires the collaboration of anywhere from 5-25 people. This is how we create our art – we bring talented and dedicated people together and facilitate the creative process in order to create something truly unique every time. Even <i>we</i> don’t know exactly what each episode will sound like until it’s finished. And by doing so, we act as a sandbox for our collaborators to take risks and expand their creative boundaries. In return, POCO is dedicated to paying each collaborator fair compensation. By supporting this campaign, you truly are supporting artists right in your own community.</p>
<p>The most important part of our community, however, is <i>you. </i>We would not be able to create this art if we did not have stories to tell. That's where you come in! In order to make sure we are telling relevant and topical stories that you care about, we want to source them right from our listeners.

<p>The outbreak of COVID-19 put a hiatus on most performance and forced the arts community to quickly adapt to virtual media. POCO is determined to do everything we can to support local artists. We compensate all of our artists for their time and energy, and the numbers can add up quickly. In addition to our start-up costs and staff, each Podcast Opera can cost from $500-$2000 to produce. And in order to ensure our artists are paid, the founders of POCO have each invested their own time and money, and will not receive any profits until each artist and collaborator is paid in full. Here is a breakdown of some of the estimated individual costs, which depend on the length and complexity of the assignment:</p>
<p>Librettist: $100-$500<br/>Composer: $200-$800<br/>Recording Engineer $150-$500 ($45/hour)<br/>Performers: $50-$500 (depending on length of role and professional level)</p>
<p>We have chosen a flexible plan on IndieGoGo, so that even if we don't reach our fundraising goal, we will be able to pay our artists! This also means that as soon as you give, we are notified and can welcome you into the POCO community.</p>

Announcing the first season of the POCO Podcast, from The Podcast Opera Company, premiering August 5th wherever you get your podcasts!
The Podcast Opera Company takes a brand new approach to audio storytelling that combines the creative range of music with the thoughtful analysis of talk radio and the ease of listening to your favorite podcasts.

<h2>Premise</h2>
<p>A burnt out preschool teacher fights tooth and nail against the unflinching director of a daycare to maintain control of her classroom or risk losing her job to someone else.</p>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Think of a job filled with so much joy and all the challenges, and you might be a teacher; a place filled with so much routine and all the curveballs, and you might be at daycare; an age with all of the growth and none of the coordination, and you are definitely in preschool. </p>
<p>Welcome to Early Birds.</p>
<p>At one end is a revolving door of new hires who realize how crazy this work truly is. And at the other end is a dead end. This is where you find the aging veterans, who could never quite seem to muster the energy or the money to escape its grasp.</p>
<p>In between? A rollercoaster of childhood emotion and some unavoidable bodily discharge. </p>
<p>This is the daily reality facing the teachers of Early Birds Childcare Education Center. Combine that with their serious lack of qualifications, overbearing parents, and a domineering director, and then top it off with an unforgiving set of rules and regulations, and you have a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>But the driving force of this story is not in the projectiles nor the discipline.  It’s the relationships that make the difference amidst the chaos. Because when disaster strikes, you look to those closest to you to make sure they don’t stab you in the back. This is a workplace where anything goes, so long as it gets you to the end of the day. </p>
<p><i><strong>-----Sounds fun! So, what's the deal with the fundraising??-----</strong></i></p>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>We're two teachers and a slew of actors trying to dive into the world of scripted comedy podcasts, which are few and far between. This series was conceived as a television show by Mark Faylent (teacher, writer, co-director) while working in childcare many years ago. Amidst recent pandemic times, he enjoyed listening to sitcoms while working around the house without looking at the screen, and realized that this series could be produced as a podcast.</p>
<p>In mid-March, Mark shared the pilot script with his best friend from high school, Jake Leibold (teacher, producer, editor), and his wife Lisa Helmi Johanson (actor, producer, co-director), who so happens to be an actor in NYC. After laughing their heads off, they decided to produce a podcast!</p>
<h3>Our impact</h3>
<p>These past months in the US has been hard for a lot of people, especially those whose industries have basically disappeared for the foreseeable future. In producing this podcast, we are achieving a number of goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating an open, creative space for a number of actors to do what they love and get paid for it</li>
<li>Delivering a story that is relatable and humorous for anyone that has kids or works with kids, but also shining a light on inequity in early childhood education.</li>
<li>Intentionally writing authentic stories for BIPOC  and LGBTQIA+ voices and, of course, casting them with BIPOC  and LGBTQIA+ actors.</li>
<li>Showing aspects of the inner-workings of education and childcare, which is often a ton of work for very little pay.</li>
<li>Being able to do this all remotely!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>Producing a podcast with award-winning actors ain't free! The majority of the money in our goal amount is going to the actors, with some paying for script edits, sound design, and other technical aspects.</p>
<p>Our first season of Preschool: The Podcast comprises 6 episodes - paying for the actors and edits is about $700/episode, so $4,200 total.</p>
<p>Sound effects, website and podcast hosting, microphone purchases, etc. is about $550 total.</p>
<p>Indiegogo charges a 5% fee + transaction fee of 2.9% + 30 cents per donation. So 7.9% + ($0.30 x number of donations) of what we raise goes to Indiegogo and the payment processor.<br/>----------------</p>
<p>$4,200 + $550 = $4,750 is what we are trying to raise for the podcast. $450 should cover all of the fees. $4,750 + $450 = $5,200 for the total fundraiser</p>
<p><i><strong>Any money raised above our goal </strong>(minus the fees)<strong> will be donated to charity.</strong></i> If we are fortunate to raise enough money to fully fund our first season, all additional money will be given to the All Stars Project, a national nonprofit that uses a performance-based approach to help tens of thousands of inner-city youth and their families create success in their lives. You can read more about the All Stars Project here: <a href=""https://allstars.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://allstars.org/</a></p>
<h3>Your Rewards</h3>
<p>No good deed goes unnoticed! We couldn't produce this podcast without your wonderful support, especially during this difficult time. Due to the nature of the world right now, we're keeping most of our rewards digital but they're still pretty nifty. For all donation levels, you'll receive all of the rewards up to the amount you donate (so, for Storytime! at $20, you'll receive a digital copy of the script, get early access to episode 1, be put on the website as a donor, and get a virtual high five).</p>

<li>For $1+: Receive a virtual high five from us!</li>
<li>For $5+: Added as a donor on our website (<a href=""http://www.preschoolthepodcast.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.preschoolthepodcast.com</a>). You'll be forever glorified as one of our first supporters :)</li>

<p>The publication of the report was released April 18, 2019, and is available at <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">justice.gov/storage/report.pdf</a></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>For many of us, sitting down to read through the entire report page-by-page is a challenge. Making this available in an audio format, without biased political commentary, is my goal. </p>
<p>Because of the wide public interest in the document, I also believe it <strong>should be available for free</strong> for anyone who is unable to pay for it. For that reason, anyone who would like a hand in producing the audio, is asked to pay whatever amount they wish based on the value-for-value model.</p>
<h3>""Value for Value"" explained</h3>
<p>If listening to the audio of the document saves hours of your time that you would have otherwise spent reading, you can decide for yourself what that amount is worth to you and you can choose to return that value by donating to the production costs of this effort.</p>
<p>If you believe there is larger value in making the report available for those unable to pay for it, because others have chosen to make a similar product but only behind a paywall, then you can choose to donate what you consider that value to be. It's totally up to you!</p>
<p>Now that the initial campaign is over (and Indiegogo removed the ability to choose any amount), I've set up some basic tiers based on the most common donations that came in during the first few weeks, but you can email donate@timberlanemedia.com if you would like a different tier added.</p>

The publication of the report was released April 18, 2019, and is available at justice.gov/storage/report.pdf
Summary
For many of us, sitting down to read through the entire report page-by-page is a challenge. Making this available in an audio format, without biased political commentary, is my goal. 
Because of the wide public interest in the document, I also believe it should be available for free for anyone who is unable to pay for it. For that reason, anyone who would like a hand in producing the audio, is asked to pay whatever amount they wish based on the value-for-value model.
""Value for Value"" explained
If listening to the audio of the document saves hours of your time that you would have otherwise spent reading, you can decide for yourself what that amount is worth to you and you can choose to return that value by donating to the production costs of this effort.
If you believe there is larger value in making the report available for those unable to pay for it, because others have chosen to make a similar product but only behind a paywall, then you can choose to donate what you consider that value to be. It's totally up to you!
Now that the initial campaign is over (and Indiegogo removed the ability to choose any amount), I've set up some basic tiers based on the most common donations that came in during the first few weeks, but you can email donate@timberlanemedia.com if you would like a different tier added.
You can support in other ways by telling your coworkers, friends and family about the show, sharing the episodes on social media, and rating and reviewing the podcast on the various platforms are other ways to help return the value you get from this production effort.

<h3><strong>WHY MENTAL UN-HEALTH?</strong></h3>
<p><i>It's okay to talk about this sh*t.</i></p>
<p>My name is Shatai Joiner and my educational background is in mental health counseling and psychology. I have worked in the mental health field with children, teens, and adults in clinical and community settings. One common theme I've noted with people of all ages is SHAME, and I am aiming to BREAK THE STIGMA attached to mental illness. This podcast will create a platform for REAL people to share their stories (the good, bad and the f*cked up) with the world, with the hopes of reaching listeners who need to hear these experiences, and understand that they're not alone. </p>
<p>Mental health is not openly talked about, even though Published studies report that about 25 percent of all U.S. adults have a mental illness and that nearly 50 percent of U.S. adults will develop at least one mental illness during their lifetime. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WE TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE...SO WHY AREN'T WE TALKING ABOUT THIS?!</strong> (wait for it.....we're about to) </p>
<p><strong><u>Let's not wait until someone dear to us, or a well known celebrity, ends their life to make mental health a trending topic. </u></strong></p>

<h3>What is Bandictionary?</h3>
<p>My name is Emily. In 2006, when I was 13 years old, I started a little website in my bedroom: Bandictionary. Although Bandictionary originally started with the goal to help me talk to my favorite bands, it quickly became more than that. The site featured exclusive interviews with band members that allowed fans to learn more about their favorite musicians and meet the people behind the music. We spoke with members of bands like Thursday, The Academy Is..., Senses Fail, and Gym Class Heroes, and featured photos of bands like Paramore and My Chemical Romance. Despite the site's modest success, I made the difficult decision to shut it down in 2010 due to lack of time and funding.<br/><br/>My goal is to re-launch Bandictionary in 2013 and devote as much time and energy as possible to help the site reach its full potential. The site will feature new photos, interviews, and articles featuring the bands you love, plus a brand-new design to make navigating the site easier. There might be a few extras in the works, as well, but let's not get ahead of ourselves!</p>
<p>Although Bandictionary had a good group of dedicated readers, it never became the popular resource that I dreamed of. Shutting down Bandictionary was like giving up on a dream, and aside from providing great new content for music lovers worldwide, re-launching the site would also give me another shot at making that dream come true. However, none of this will be possible without your help!</p>

<div style=""display: none;""> </div></div>","What is Bandictionary?
My name is Emily. In 2006, when I was 13 years old, I started a little website in my bedroom: Bandictionary. Although Bandictionary originally started with the goal to help me talk to my favorite bands, it quickly became more than that. The site featured exclusive interviews with band members that allowed fans to learn more about their favorite musicians and meet the people behind the music. We spoke with members of bands like Thursday, The Academy Is..., Senses Fail, and Gym Class Heroes, and featured photos of bands like Paramore and My Chemical Romance. Despite the site's modest success, I made the difficult decision to shut it down in 2010 due to lack of time and funding.My goal is to re-launch Bandictionary in 2013 and devote as much time and energy as possible to help the site reach its full potential. The site will feature new photos, interviews, and articles featuring the bands you love, plus a brand-new design to make navigating the site easier. There might be a few extras in the works, as well, but let's not get ahead of ourselves!
Although Bandictionary had a good group of dedicated readers, it never became the popular resource that I dreamed of. Shutting down Bandictionary was like giving up on a dream, and aside from providing great new content for music lovers worldwide, re-launching the site would also give me another shot at making that dream come true. However, none of this will be possible without your help!

<h2>What's Obsidian Tea?</h2>
<p>Hey! My name is Grey. I’m a Black Trans man with a communication degree, and the sole creator of the blog <strong>Obsidian Tea</strong>. On OT, I have been creating educational, engaging content and discussions around black culture and history.</p>
<p>My blog has been running for two years and has gone from a casual side project to a full time job. Some articles have received upwards of <strong>20,000 views.</strong> </p>
<h3>Our mission</h3>
<p>One thing I’ve noticed is that the media is often split for white or black audiences.<strong> Through Obsidian Tea, I strive to create media that connects these audiences, exposes blind spots, supports allies and helps people see heritage and legacy that has been hidden for so long. </strong></p>
<p>As is, there's only so much my website can do. Your investment would allow me not only to expand, but to bring my philosophy and skills to the corporate world and really make an impact.</p>
<p>After all, just as a single tea leaf can change it's flavor, I believe my work can make a big difference.</p>
<h2>Where we’ve been -&gt; Where we are going</h2>
<p>Recently, I began doing some light consultation work around issues of race, gender, ability and sexuality. I was starting to do work around socio economic status, when a loved one stopped me.</p>
<p>“You know, you could be paid a lot more for this work,” she told me.</p>
<p>I was shocked. I didn’t believe her. Begrudgingly, I looked into it.</p>
<p>She was right.</p>
<p>Could I be doing the same work for corporations, small business and non profits? Could I be having an even bigger effect on the world?</p>
<p>I took a hard look at myself, my blog, and my potential. I believe I really can make a big impact on how we handle difficult conversations around diversity. However, I’m going to need some help.</p>
<h2>""Ok, What you need?""</h2>
<p><strong>This campaign is a jumpstart from casual blogger, to professional.</strong> The goal is to not only get the site up to par, but also for me to attend trainings and seminars/conferences for networking, invest in new tools, and create opportunities outside of the blog. </p>
<h3>What I need</h3>
<p>I would like to invest in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vocal/Speech coaching</li>
<li>Website tools</li>
<li>Professional attire, photos and business cards</li>
<li>Classes </li>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Writing </li>
<li>SEO/Marketing Work</li>
<li>Editer/translator</li>
<li>Quickbooks</li>
<li>Conferences </li>
<li>Office space</li>
<li>Marketing budget</li>
<li>Visiting resources</li>
<li>Equipment I can use for website upkeep, interviews, and full desktop accessibility</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, I hope to turn Obsidian Tea into an LLC - an official private company.  </p>
<p>These things would take me, and the site, from being a passion project to a sustainable business. It would not only deeply affect my life, but it would also create a service that is missing in the discussion around race in the U.S.: Translation.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where you come in!</h3>
<p><strong>In 6 months I want the quality of Obsidian Tea to improve significantly. </strong></p>
<p>To really make this happen,<strong> I’ll need $5,000</strong></p>
<p>Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Big chunks of funding are going towards my <i>new equipment</i>, <i>site development</i>, and <i>training</i>.</li>
<li>I’d like to <i>pay people</i> to assist with the things I struggle with.</li>
<li>This funding would also allow me some space from <i>financial scarcity fears</i>, to allow me to sit and focus on growth, rather than making ends meet.</li>
</ul>
<p>How I've been doing things means I’ve traded a lot of time for being cost effective. It also means I live in a state of constant worry about dropping quality, disappointing readers, and stress. I’d like to delegate some of that. </p>
<h3>What you are supporting: </h3>
<p>This project has already made an impact on the way many people consider race relations in this country, and it has the potential to do more. Conversations about race and culture in this country, are hard and complex. Most people misstep, but not because they want to; simply from lack of experience and knowledge.</p>
<p>I want to give people <strong>tools</strong> to handle these conversations better, <strong>knowledge</strong> of the context that shapes them, and <strong>deeper</strong>, more down to earth version of global <strong>conversations</strong> that are being had about black culture and people.</p>
<p>Currently, the disparity between the white and black experience is an issue that goes unseen. I aim to change that. </p>
<p>Additionally my work with corporations and training would allow a more direct impact on the systems that many unconsciously uphold. It would literally change quality of life for many people.</p>
<p>This project has been running for two years and is read all over the world. It’s made an impact. <strong>Let’s make it bigger.</strong></p>

<h3>""Ok, I’m considering it. What’s in it for me?""</h3>
<p>First of all: Thank you!</p>
<p>To honor the supporters of this project, there are a few bonuses. They range from simple thanks, to E books and sketches, to one-on-one time. I will also be reaching out to my support network and updating everyone every step of the way towards making this business sustainable. </p>
<p>More perks will be revealed as the project unfolds!</p>

<h3>I can't give money! Is there anything else I can do?</h3>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In early 2017, I was recent college graduate and an even more recent full-time employee at a job that left me feeling disconnected both from myself and the world at large.  I wanted desperately to get back to my roots as a writer and work on something I would be able to share with a community.  I spent the entire summer trying and failing to make other ideas to work, until I was at the point where I felt I needed to just start writing <i>something</i>, even if I didn't know what the grander plan for it was. </p>
<p>That was when I started writing a simple little story called ""The Beacon"" - a story about a girl who was not unlike myself, who was attending a college not unlike the one I had attended.  And while there were fantastic elements that could never compare to real life, like magical fire powers and giant wolf-lizard monsters, it was still a story about trying to reach out to others when isolation is the easy alternative and learning what your responsibility to those around you is - both issues I was struggling to answer for myself at the time.</p>
<p>July 2018, just over a year ago now, was when I began to release season one of The Beacon.  I was no longer alone in my endeavor.  I was backed by a wonderfully talented cast and received help from so many fellow members of the audio drama community along the way, something which allowed me to release 10 full episodes of the show across five months and complete our first season.  </p>
<p>For all the work it demanded of us, I was monumentally proud of the finished product, and now we're ready to undertake this challenge again and continue the story we left at a cliffhanger in December 2018.  The scripts are written.  The cast is selected.  All that's left is to run this campaign so we can help pay everyone involved and continue to make a quality production.</p>
<p>-Claudia</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The Beacon is aiming for $3,000 in funding.  The largest portion of this will go towards paying the voice cast of the show.  After this is paying for the production costs per episode, covering both the sound effects budget and the time and labor spent editing; the cost of producing and shipping for backer rewards; and miscellaneous costs such as hosting fees for the year.</p>
<p>The most important aspect is being able to pay the cast for their invaluable work for the season, so any amount over the goal will go towards increasing the amount paid to them.  They will also be the first paid, given any shortfalls in reaching the fundraising goal, after considering the amount needed to fulfill backer rewards.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Speaking of which - donating to this campaign will not only help this season come into being, but land you some sweet Beacon-related rewards!  At smaller donation levels, our backers can get physical rewards related to the show like stickers and buttons, and even donating at the $5 level will land you a spot on the Acknowledgments page of our website as a thanks.</p>
<p>Backers can also get access to some exclusive rewards, including an RSS feed that continues the story of our D&amp;D minisode, and three trading cards designed specifically for this campaign.  Those who want something a little more personal can also get a signed and annotated season one script, or even have the option to name a character in the upcoming season!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Not everyone who wants to support our show is able to donate - and that's okay!  Because giving money isn't the only way to support us.  Even sharing the link with others who might be able to is a huge help, and we thank you so much for everything you're able to do to help.</p>

Club, Discover Pods, and elsewhere. It was featured by Apple Podcasts, Buzzfeed, Spotify, and Radio Public. That season was also a labor of love on the part of creators Emily VanDerWerff, Christopher Dole, and Sara Ghaleb, the culmination of two years of incredibly hard (and often volunteer) work from our incredible cast and crew.</p><p>Season Two of <i>Arden</i> is going to be bigger, more ambitious and (we hope!) even better. We're putting everything we learned making Season One into action to create the <u><i><strong>greatest audio fiction podcast season of all time</strong></i></u>. Or just something really special. Either/or.</p><p>That's why we need your help. We want to make sure we can compensate all the cast and crew for their time. We're also moving into a new recording space, which will allow us much higher recording quality, which is primarily what this fundraising effort provides for. For further details on this, see below!</p><p>We have spent the last 10 months plotting, writing, rehearsing, and re-writing. (Seriously. Most of our scripts have gone through seven drafts at this point.) We truly cannot wait to share this season with you. But we need your help to get there. Join us, won't you, as we dive back into the world of <i>Arden</i>.</p><h3><strong>What's Next for Arden:</strong></h3><p>Now that we've hit our initial funding target (Thank you, thank you, thank you!), it's time to talk <strong>stretch goals</strong>. See, one of the things that's happened in the course of developing Season Two is we've come up with a lot of ideas on how to expand the world of <i>Arden</i>. We think you'll like them.</p><p>At $7,000, we will make a <strong>“Bea Casely’s Undeniable Sexual Energy” shirt</strong>. We’ll do it. No one would stop us!</p><p>At $8,000, we will produce a currently-untitled series of <strong>minisodes focused on the prison stint and eventual release of Julie Capsom</strong>. Yes, fan favorite Lindsay Zana will be back!</p><p>At $9,000, we will produce <strong>Life in Elsinore, a series of minisodes</strong> where Rosalind Ursula learns more about the town of Elsinore, our setting for Season 2.</p><p>At $10,000, we will produce <strong>The Andy Wheyface Christmas Special</strong>. And given how long Emily has been waiting to write a Christmas special, you can bet it's going to be buckwild.</p><p>At $12,000, Emily and Libby Hill will record <strong>a one-off special episode of their beloved (and currently long-on-hiatus) podcast TV on the Internet</strong>, in which they each rank The Ten Best TV Shows of All Time. Ranking things is tough, but they'll do it <i>for you.</i></p><p>At $15,000, we will produce <strong>Arden Presents: A Town Called Elsinore, the actual in-universe show-within-a-show</strong> of Season 2.</p><p>At $25,000, we will hold a <strong>live finale reading in Los Angeles for all backers</strong>. For those of you who can't be there, it will be livestreamed. You do need to provide your own transportation, as we haven't exactly gotten Wheyface Airlines off the ground yet.</p><p>At $50,000, <strong>we will be able to pay our cast and crew triple</strong> what they've been contracted for, a fee that would be commensurate with comparable work on an independent film. Think of the goodwill that would swell in your heart! </p><p>At $75,000, <strong>we'll just license a whole bunch of music</strong> to put into Season 2. Taylor Swift, Kacey Musgraves, Phoebe Bridgers, the whole shebang.</p><p>At $100,000, <strong>we'll go on tour</strong>, putting on shows in Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, and New York. Maybe we'll all drive in a van! </p><p>At $150,000, the cast and crew will form <strong>an intramural softball team</strong> and join an LA 2020 summer league.</p><p>At $250,000, we will <strong>buy the fiction podcasting rights to Stephen King's <i>Under The Dome</i></strong> and will make a fiction podcast set in the world of <i>Under The Dome</i>. It will not be a direct adaptation of <i>Under The Dome</i>, nor will it take place under a Dome. But characters will make references to... the Dome.</p><p>At $300,000, <strong>Michelle Agresti (Bea Casely) will write the first draft</strong> <strong>of a minisode</strong> about Bea Casely in high school. No promises beyond that first draft. </p><h3><strong>Why We're Fundraising:</strong></h3><p>We will be recording for 15 days in the Rebel Talk recording facility in Los Angeles (we said this season was going to big and ambitious!) and also investing in much more detailed sound mixing and design. Season One of Arden was — by design — a comparatively minimalist production in terms of its aural environments. That changes this season. We're designing an entire world, including the small town of Elsinore, Montana, and the nearby Hamill Hills Ranch. These funds will allow us to create as complete an environment as we plan.</p><p>Additionally, these funds will largely contribute to compensating our growing cast for their time and incredible work.</p><h3><strong>What You Get:</strong></h3><p>Now the exciting part, the perks!</p><p>So, here's the big thing: if you pledge at $5, you will receive the first three episodes (of 13) of Arden Season Two on February 24. That's the Monday before the season premiere is publicly released. You will receive the rest of the episodes in several groups throughout the season. You'll get to binge-listen early to hear all the twists and turns — every gag, every Wheyface ad, and every romantic development (and oh yes, there will be romance). You will look very smart when you predict what's going to happen and then are magically correct! You'll be the envy of all your Arden-listening friends who didn't pledge. What spoiler-plagued fools they are! </p><p>You will also receive:</p><p><strong>Shout-outs!</strong> Everyone who pledges will be listed on our website as one of Wheyface Industries' official Good People. </p><p><strong>Access </strong>to our exclusive Discord!</p><p><strong>Behind-the-scenes material!</strong> Learn about what it takes to make a fiction podcast and go behind the scenes with co-creators Emily VanDerWerff, Christopher Dole, and Sara Ghaleb in our episodic commentaries, which we will be recording in conjunction with the making of Season Two.</p><p><strong>Minisodes!</strong> At every 20 percent of this campaign, you will receive early access to a new minisode. Featuring: some of the other programming at Wheyface Industries! An ""internal test"" trailer for a Season 2 personnel shake-up! More Bea, Rosalind, Brenda, Andy, and Pamela than you can shake a stick at! All culminating — when we hit 100 percent — with a minisode that exclusively answers Season One's biggest remaining mystery: <i><strong>Who. Burned. Brenda. Bentley's. Truck. </strong></i>This minisode will <i>never</i> be available on the main feed. You must pledge to our IndieGoGo or our Patreon to receive it! </p><p><strong>The story of the time Roger Ebert almost got Emily VanDerWerff fired: </strong>Once we cross 100 percent, Emily will tell IndieGoGo supporters this enthralling story of death, derring do, and the redemption of a Film Twitter villain!</p><p>But wait!

Keep an eye here and on social media for updates), and <strong>a special thanks in the credits</strong> of one episode of Season Two, performed by Benjamin Watts (Andy Wheyface himself) with soaring, <i>West Wing</i> theme-esque music in the background. Think of how inspiring your name will sound!</p><p>At $25, you will receive everything listed above and <strong>a Season Two soundtrack</strong> featuring nine original songs performed in-show by SPOILER CHARACTER, composed by Laura Stratford, co-founder of Chicago's award-winning Underscore Theare, and additional music from our AudioVerse Award-nominated score by Chris Hatfield! You will also receive <strong>all minisodes previously exclusive to our Patreon</strong>!</p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: We have also added a SECOND $25 tier for <strong>DIGITAL-ONLY REWARDS</strong>. These include the soundtrack, minisodes, special thanks, early episodes, Discord access and AN EXCLUSIVE-TO-THIS-TIER Digital Wallpaper of our new Season 2 logo!</p><p>At $100, you will receive everything listed above and Vox's Critic at Large Emily VanDerWerff will <strong>read a piece of your writing and provide you with personalized feedback</strong>! We'll also send you <strong>a MYSTERY BOX</strong> when Season Two premieres, containing surprise swag! This one we'll be limiting to only 25 buyers, so act quickly!</p><p>At $350, you will receive everything listed above, and <strong>a producer credit on Season Two</strong>, with Benjamin Watts reading your name in every episode as though it were poetry written by Shakespeare himself, with positively Aaron Copland-esque background music. How your heart will swell upon hearing it! You’ll also receive <strong>a USB drive with SECRET AUDIO</strong>. Secret Audio! Sounds pretty neat, right?</p><p>At $500, we will write, produce, and incorporate into Season Two a <strong>custom Wheyface Industries advertisement for whatever project you want</strong>. You will also receive a custom <strong>Executive Producer credit</strong>, with Ben reading your name as thought it were the sweetest of hymnals, and even MORE inspiring background music! This one will be limited to 13 buyers (one for every episode of Season Two).</p><p>At $2000, an <i>Arden </i>executive producer will <strong>show up at your doorstep</strong> and treat you to <strong>a round of minigolf and/or bowling</strong>. Only five of these are available!</p><p>At $100,000, you will <strong>own 20 percent of <i>Arden</i></strong>, a highly acclaimed independent podcast, which means if we ever sell adaptation rights, you'll be entitled to 20 percent of that filthy Hollywood lucre. Needless to say, only one of these perks is available.</p><h3><strong>The Impact:</strong></h3><p>We put our blood, sweat, and tears into Season One and will do so once again. We're committed to telling stories from the perspective of those who don't often get to tell their own stories — and really digging deep. Our show examines just why we're so obsessed with true crime, how we balance empathy for the victims with our desire to know more, and when that becomes dangerous. That the show has been as warmly received as it has is deeply moving and inspiring, and we are going into Season Two creatively recharged and determined to make something even better — indeed, the <strong><i><u>greatest season of an audio fiction podcast ever</u></i></strong>. Or just something fantastic. We'll settle for that, too.</p><h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges:</strong></h3><p>Of course, there can certainly be challenges along the way. Actors get sick, necessitating schedule changes. Editing takes longer than expected. Maybe flying cars will suddenly appear and become widespread, meaning that once again we'll have to keep stopping for traffic.</p><p>But we're smart kids. We've figured it out before. We'll do it again.</p><h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help:</strong></h3><p>If you're not in a position to donate, but you want to help, the most valuable thing you can do is get the word out. If you like the show tell your friends, your family, and your dentist (even if they're trying to get you to stop talking because they'd really like to see what's going on with that back tooth). In fact, tell random strangers on the street. Just go up to them and tell them to listen and donate. You'd be surprised how many friends you can make that way!</p><p>But really, let everyone who you think would like the show know about it, and about the fundraiser.

<h3>A New Camera for Witchy Words!</h3>
<p>Hi everyone! My name is Marietta and I'm the content creator behind <a href=""http://www.witchywords.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Witchy Words</strong></a>, a blog about modern witchcraft and paganism.  If you're from the Kansas City community, you may know me as the volunteer event photographer for most of the public rituals in the area.  Being able to volunteer my time and take these photos is my way of giving back to a community that I truly love and want to support in any way I can. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488948318/wojor5dese3gtxuhlpvb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I currently work with a Sony RX100.  The RX100 is the best low-lighting and quick movement capture camera on the market for being a mix between a DSLR and a Point-and-Shoot. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488948455/d2lkaasqso7sgq6c5ohs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In layman's terms, the RX100 allows me to discretely take excellent photos at events without hauling around a giant camera and making lense changes.  It ensures pictures come out clear even in very dark settings or when ritual attendees are moving quickly. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488948786/lecsbfjtrnewdaidqu06.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I have owned my current RX100 since 2013.  I've been having stalling issues with my camera, which can interrupt my ability to take all of the essential photos I need, missing some of the most important key elements of ritual.  My camera has been struggling to focus for probably almost a year leading to blurry photos.  The LCD screen is partially damaged from general wear and tear.  All of these problems have increased greatly over the past few months.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488948683/g6ii1ukjxhdji9zo09mg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In addition to all of this, I have a crack in my lens that is becoming harder and harder to edit out of final photos.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488948816/kifgkmzbpjvbs8bvkpsk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I started a GoFundMe campaign seven months ago and raised $275 ($250 after fees).  A thank you to those who donated there will be listed below.  Unfortunately, I need the funds in a more timely fashion as my camera is likely to go within the next couple of months.  Having a camera allows me to continue to produce the same content I always have, to continue to volunteer as a photographer in the pagan community.  If you have a spare dollar or two lying around and wouldn't mind contributing to keep a blogger working, I would certainly appreciate it!</p>

<h3>
<br/>What I Need</h3>
<p>In order to continue taking photos, I <i>need</i> a new camera.  That's indisputable.  However, after my experience with the Sony RX-100, I would like to stay with the same kind of camera.  While the Sony RX-100 is up to their fifth incarnation, both four and five come with overheating and technical issues that concern me.  Instead of looking at the most recent camera in the market, I'm looking at the best one for what I do: The Sony RX-100M III.  It's still being sold by Sony brand new and makes improvements upon on what the RX-100 line is known for - low lighting event photos, quick capture and high resolution.</p>
<p>I'm not asking for the latest, newest or brightest.  I'm just asking for something that keeps me functional.</p>
<p>The Sony RX-100M III is currently going for $698.  With the $250 raised from GoFundMe, that brings it down to $448.  Add on the 5% IndieGoGo fee and I just need $470 to get a camera that keeps me blogging.  In addition, I would need a new carrier for the camera since the RX-100M III is a different size from my current camera.  That brings us up to a nice, round $500.</p>
<p>I'm setting a time limit of 60 days to obtain these funds.  I don't think my current camera will last much longer than that.</p>
<p>Over the next two months, I'll be working alongside supporters to gain the funds necessary to replace my camera.  Even if I don't hit my goal here, that camera will need to be replaced.  Any funds here will go strictly to that.<br/> </p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>Let's say I raise <i>more</i> than the $500 I need.  This would give me a chance to get some much needed filters and lenses for my camera that would help me take even better photos!  Here's some stretch goals I have in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$555</strong> - Adding UV, FL-D and C-PL filters.  Sometimes it's really bright outside, which can wash a photo out (overexposure).  Sometimes, indoor lighting makes skin look a sickly yellow color.  These filters will allow me to adjust my camera for any lighting situation I might be in.</li>
<li>
<strong>$690</strong> - Adding a telephoto lens.  A telephoto lens will allow me to take pictures that look like I'm closer to the action than I actually am.  This is particularly handy in rituals where I can't break from the circle.</li>
<li>
<strong>$765</strong> - Adding a macro lens.  Kind of the opposite of a telephoto lens, this will allow me to take even better up close photos of altars and items.  It lets me capture details and focus on the tiny item in front of me.</li>
<li>
<strong>$960 </strong>- Waterproof housing.  While I'm unlikely to need to take photos underwater, waterproof housing can allow me to take photos in the rain without worrying about destroying my camera.  While I've been incredibly fortunate that public rituals outside have always been sans rain, one day, that won't be the case and I won't be able to take pictures!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, I completely understand!  I wouldn't be asking for assistance if I had the money to put towards this.  However, there are other ways you can help out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.  The more people that see this, the more likely I am to hit my much-needed goal.</li>
<li>Indiegogo has a share tool.  Use it to share this to your favorite social media platform!</li>
</ul>

In my travels through the abyss, I have asked myself many profound questions: What does trauma mean? What does it do to the psyche? How do we uncreate identity to find our true self? How does trauma impact the facets that make up our individual world? And how can we use trauma to explore our core, and find gold?</p><p>Since the accident, I have written hundreds of insights from this extra-ordinary space. A space that I have come to be grateful for.</p><p>This project - <i>The Burgundy Book</i> - will bring together these insights and weave them into a series of short podcasts. In a gently poetic and storytelling style that is honest, authentic and sometimes very raw, each episode will take the listener through a curious, graphic, yet tender journey into the furthermost corners of my experience. Episodes will comprise spoken word and original music.</p><p>Trauma and challenge are universal, and I believe that many people will feel able to resonate and connect to my experience, and find hope in my story.</p><p>Please support <i>The Burgundy Book</i>, and help me to share this story with the world.</p><p>Your help will enable me to bring together my team of artist colleagues and collaborators, both for the music and the overall production of <i>The Burgundy Book</i>.</p><p>Thank you from my heart.</p><p> </p><p>Some comments on the work:</p><p><i>‘Absolutely spellbinding!’</i> Kristine Landon-Smith - KLS Associates and founder/former Artistic Director of Tamasha Theatre Co.</p><p> </p><p>‘<i>We say it all the time, don't we? ""You could get hit by a bus tomorrow."" So there is something about Renu's story of her near death experience that immediately stops you in your tracks. It begins in a taxi, as she recounts a now well-rehearsed story to her driver about her accident. It's not only the story, but the quality of Renu's voice that captivates - calm and unhysterical.

In my travels through the abyss, I have asked myself many profound questions: What does trauma mean? What does it do to the psyche? How do we uncreate identity to find our true self? How does trauma impact the facets that make up our individual world? And how can we use trauma to explore our core, and find gold?Since the accident, I have written hundreds of insights from this extra-ordinary space. A space that I have come to be grateful for.This project - The Burgundy Book - will bring together these insights and weave them into a series of short podcasts. In a gently poetic and storytelling style that is honest, authentic and sometimes very raw, each episode will take the listener through a curious, graphic, yet tender journey into the furthermost corners of my experience. Episodes will comprise spoken word and original music.Trauma and challenge are universal, and I believe that many people will feel able to resonate and connect to my experience, and find hope in my story.Please support The Burgundy Book, and help me to share this story with the world.Your help will enable me to bring together my team of artist colleagues and collaborators, both for the music and the overall production of The Burgundy Book.Thank you from my heart. Some comments on the work:‘Absolutely spellbinding!’ Kristine Landon-Smith - KLS Associates and founder/former Artistic Director of Tamasha Theatre Co. ‘We say it all the time, don't we? ""You could get hit by a bus tomorrow."" So there is something about Renu's story of her near death experience that immediately stops you in your tracks. It begins in a taxi, as she recounts a now well-rehearsed story to her driver about her accident. It's not only the story, but the quality of Renu's voice that captivates - calm and unhysterical. Would I be like that? I'm really looking forward to hearing more of The Burgundy Book.  Rasheed Rahman - Freelance Arts Marketing ‘Incredibly powerful and beautifully poetic. Renu uses her highly skilled storytelling style to portray the impact of the physical and emotional trauma from the accident itself, the profound and spiritual experience of the Near Death Experience, and the everyday - how life has changed for her. I can't wait to hear these narratives once they are combined with Renu's ethereal singing voice!’ Cheryl Kempton - Holistic Health Coach  ‘It’s an incredible journey that Renu has been on since having a N.D.E. in 2017.  Renu’s gentle voice is calming to the listener and the story of her life since the accident is truly inspiring. This episode is very touching and tells a story about human connection and understanding.’ David M Naylor - Musician, Poet ‘Amazing.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is MISTER METALSHIRT and i'm just a guy who loves HEAVY METAL!! I think that it's the best music that there is. So like I got all these HEAVY METAL shirts and I want to start selling them, you know, and I want to do movies on the internet where I talk about the shirts and how cool they are. and maybe talk about the bands too. And you can watch the movies maybe like on your phone, and if you like the shirts you can go to where I sell them and you'll buy them. So my boss, Myron, he's like... 'well why don't you do that crowdfunding stuff and get money to buy more HEAVY METAL shirts?'</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So, yea, what I did was design my own shirts as a prize for the crowdfunding!! So like if you give me money you can get one, or like maybe stickers that I'll make too. And then basically, when I get all the money, I'll make the shirts and the stickers and send them to you!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>So if people give me money, I'll be able to do things WAY BETTER! For one, I can print up all the shirts and stickers that I designed. Then, I don't know, maybe i could like design even more cooler shirts later on and sell those. Also I already have an internet store at <a href=""http://depop.com/mistermetalshirt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">depop.com/mistermetalshirt</a>, but like I only got a few shirts up there cause I need money to buy more! And then also I could maybe afford to take a couple days off work so I can do some movies where I talk about how awesome different HEAVY METAL shirts are... kinda like my very own show. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>really like all i gotta do is just go to the print shop and get the stickers and the shirts made. I already drew the picture so like, that was the hard part. and that only took like, maybe 10 minutes. It took me 5 minutes just to find a piece of paper at work. so yea i guess the drawling part only took like 5 minutes. So yea, like, i don't think its gonna be that hard to send a bunch of stickers and t-shirts to people. unless its really crowded at the post office on Wyckoff, i hate that place.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Yea so like maybe if you don't got any money or something, you could just tell some other HEAVY METAL fans like me about this indiegoogle and maybe they'll give me some money.</p>

We have been getting lots of Questions following the end of the campaign. So we've put together a handy Q&amp;A to let you know what's happening!



<h1><br/></h1><span style=""font-size: 30px; line-height: 38px;""><p><b>1. When am I getting my Digital Perks? I want Wil's Game/Diary/Certificates/Soundtrack NOW!</b></p>
<p>Since there are many various factors going into the projects, (some of which aren't even finished yet, including Wil's Game) we want to wait until we've collected as much as we can. We don't want to overload inboxes with lots of small items, once we've gathered a reasonable amount of Digital Gear we'll send out links.</p>
<p><b>2. What happened to my request for a perk upgrade I made?</b></p>
<p>We are still honoring perk upgrades that were made right before and shortly after the campaign closed. We still have hundreds (yes hundreds) of emails to sort through, but we are making progress and we will get to your request soon!</p>
<p><b>3. OH NO! I'll be at a new location come August, what if I don't get my stuff?</b></p>
<p>Don't worry about addresses quite yet, we have them on file but part of the plan is to send out a huge survey to collect information (T-shirt Sizes, Name on the 'Name in Lights' perk, etc) and we'll include a place for you to update your address there.</p>
<p><b>4. When do I get my Physical Things!</b></p>
<p>We have a lot of work to do from now until August to make sure we fulfill all of your needs. We'll be updating you as time passes so don't worry! Until then let us be the busy bees to make sure everything is AWESOME before it gets sent out to you.</p>

meet someone else who shared the same passion for board games that you do? Well
we'd love backers to have the ability to feel that way, and to say it with a

<p></p></div>","WE DID IT! AS OF THE END OF THIS CAMPAIGN WE ARE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL DIGITAL SERIES ON INDIEGOGO!

We have been getting lots of Questions following the end of the campaign. So we've put together a handy Q&A to let you know what's happening!



1. When am I getting my Digital Perks? I want Wil's Game/Diary/Certificates/Soundtrack NOW!
Since there are many various factors going into the projects, (some of which aren't even finished yet, including Wil's Game) we want to wait until we've collected as much as we can. We don't want to overload inboxes with lots of small items, once we've gathered a reasonable amount of Digital Gear we'll send out links.
2. What happened to my request for a perk upgrade I made?
We are still honoring perk upgrades that were made right before and shortly after the campaign closed. We still have hundreds (yes hundreds) of emails to sort through, but we are making progress and we will get to your request soon!
3. OH NO! I'll be at a new location come August, what if I don't get my stuff?
Don't worry about addresses quite yet, we have them on file but part of the plan is to send out a huge survey to collect information (T-shirt Sizes, Name on the 'Name in Lights' perk, etc) and we'll include a place for you to update your address there.
4. When do I get my Physical Things!
We have a lot of work to do from now until August to make sure we fulfill all of your needs. We'll be updating you as time passes so don't worry! Until then let us be the busy bees to make sure everything is AWESOME before it gets sent out to you.
Thanks for being so patient gamers, and make sure to PLAY MORE GAMES!
Special Message from Cards Against Humanity! Cards Against Humanity TableTop Expansion pack!Are you a horrible person? Details on The Cards Against Humanity expansion pack are finally here!  Here is the lowdown, straight from the man Himself!""Max here, one of the co-creators of Cards Against Humanity.Cards Against Humanity is a party game for horrible people. It's pretty simple to play: Someone asks a question or fill-in-the-blank phrase from a black card, and then everyone answers with the funniest white card in their hand. Then you just do that over and over until someone flips the table over.We're big fans of Tabletop, and we want to do our part to help make a new season, so we've agreed to work with them on a limited-edition pack of Cards Against Humanity cards, just for the backers of Tabletop Season Three.Over the next few months, we'll work with Wil to write 15-card pack of Cards Against Humanity cards, and everyone who backs this project for $20 and over will get that pack as a free bonus reward. This pack won't be part of a stretch goal or any other nonsense, it's just our way of saying thank you for supporting one of our favorite things on the internet, and helping some of our favorite people make something amazing.Thanks for your support, we're really excited to make something cool with you!""Ticket to Ride - Special Gift!In celebration of reaching our RPG show, our friends at Days of Wonder are giving all backers at $10 and above a free downloadable copy of “Ticket to Ride” on Steam! Wow, we’ve played it on both S1 and S2 we love it so much, and now you guys get your hands on the digital version! Thank you Days of Wonder!  We will email you the code when all the digital goodies are sent out following the completion of the campaign.Welcome!

But the one thing that sets me apart is that I am a Storyteller, and I have a want, a NEED to create a story. A story that stretches across history and shows how the choices we make have the power to affect the world around us, for better or for worse.</p><p>My name is Rachel Rauch and I am a nonbinary female who uses she/her, they/them pronouns. I’m the showrunner for Storytellers and the founder of the future Nine Realm Productions production house. I write about queernorm fantasy worlds that are heartfelt, hopeful, and very very magical while also confronting the truth. When I’m not writing, that’s like saying “when I’m not living,” but when I’m not writing, I’m drinking tea, watching movies, and reading books. Oh, and working a day job on the side. Just a regular 40 hour a week side gig, no big.</p><p>In all honesty, though, I would really not do any of this work without the help of my AWESOME cast and crew members. They are my REAL #PodernFamily, and it’s kind of a wonder why they agreed to help me with this. SO the least I can do is pay them for all the wonderful work they’re doing for me and that’s why I need YOUR help. As for the names of some of these wonderful people? Well they will be revealed in due time... </p><p><strong>So... enough about the people behind the curtain. What the feck is this project about?</strong></p><p>Medusa Gorgon’s Academy for Young Witches is the first “book” of a second-person, anthology storytelling podcast collection entitled Storytellers about a story that’s listening to various storytellers tell stories about the story’s life so it can piece itself back together with the end goal of either saving or destroying the world…</p><p>You know the trope of telling a story in front of the hearth with a dog at one’s feet and a crisp frost in the air; but that’s such lacklustre compared to me as I bring you stories during the END OF THE WORLD. I am Medusa Gorgon, headmistress of Medusa Gorgon’s Academy for Young Witches and, darlings, I have quite the tea to spill.</p><p>When you (or your descendants) step through the doors of Medusa Gorgon’s Academy, you are consenting to have your most intimate life shared with Medusa’s audience. Among the people who step through my doors are Chosen Ones who have a lot of disaster gay energy, descendants of death goddesses (or death goddess adjacent), gender-ambiguous gods who can really be quite fussy, professors who are done dealing with students’ shit, and sassy cynical skeletons, and much much more. </p><p>If you’re lost, we Storytellers will put the pieces back together. The black flame of the Underworld will keep the darkness at bay...for as long as it takes to tell a story. Welcome. To Medusa’s.</p><p>P.S. Remember to enjoy your pending apocalypse and watch for the ever growing dark tendrils that are wrapping their way around the Nine Realms.</p><p>P.P.S. If any of you see a happy go-lucky copper haired elf who says she’s the creator of this entire world and author of the stories kept in this world, ignore her. It’s not like she can do anything to stop our impending doom. She’s just insane that’s all. She also may have killed the first librarian, Thalia, with all her utter and complete clumsiness.</p><p><strong>Here’s the Lowdown...</strong></p><p>We’re going to need $4,500 overall.</p><p><i>The deets - </i></p><p>First and most importantly, it's going to go towards paying the actors and actresses. Right now, my actors are just doing this from the goodness of their hearts, but at the very leasI, I want to pay them $25 per episode. Everyone deserves to be paid for their work.</p><p>Second, it'll go towards paying website hosting fees. Website hosting can cost up to $81 per year and because I need the domains and the website for about 1.5 years, I need to pay for 2 so $162. It can cost $19 per year for the website hosting then another $62 for all the separate domains. </p><p>Third, it’ll go towards purchasing and keeping a Washington LLC. It will cost $200 to register then $60 per year every year after. For this campaign, it’ll be $260 of the budget.</p><p>Forth, we are planning to set aside $500 for artwork. A great chef once said, you eat with your eyes before your stomach and that is what great art does. $500 doesn’t cover all the art that has been poured into this project, but it does put a dent in that hole.</p><p>Fifth, $1000 of the budget will be set aside and paid to our composer. Right now, they are doing this work out of their love of music and sound, but being paid in exposure is not being paid. Once again, they deserve money just as much as our actors do.</p><p>Sixth, I really want to pay my sound designers. They’re doing so much work for me out of the love in their awesome hearts so I really want to be able to pay them each $25 per episode AT LEAST. I want to pay them so much more because they are worth so much more.</p><p>Lastly, it will go towards renting out recording space for $55 per hour x5. The Jack Straw Cultural Center in Seattle does some amazing audio work and they deserve all the business they can get.</p><p>Creative work doesn’t make a lot of money so every little bit helps, even if it’s just spreading the word. If you do decide to support this campaign, you could get some of the awesome perks listed below.</p><p> </p><p>What’s in it for me?</p><p>$5 Gratitude Witch - Medusa Gorgon will personally name you as a student who attends our school for one episode. You will also receive an invite to our discord server.</p><p>$15 Sticker Witch - You will receive six(6) chibi stickers of the six original main characters: Medusa, Anya, Erica, Charles, Theo, and Poppy.  </p><p>$25 Kitchen Witch - Rachel Rauch has teamed up with Friday Afternoon to create and bring you a tea blend for the Witching World. A tea blend with chocolate, toffee, and raspberry that will put you in a trance. Drink this tea and read your leaves, your future depends on it. This perk will contain 2 oz of the Witches’ Brew from Friday Afternoon and all perks in the lower tiers. </p><p>$50 Pin Witch - HeyAtlasCreative and Rachel Rauch have teamed up to bring you a black phoenix pin inspired by Medusa Gorgon’s Academy for Young Witches. </p><p>$75 Divination Witch - Two different PDF decks will be included in this reward 1) the seven(7) card tarot deck for the seven stories in this season of the anthology and 2) the twenty-two(22) card major arcana deck of the characters included in all the realms, but mostly the Witching World. This perk will include a guide on how to read the cards and will also include all rewards in the lower tiers.</p><p>$100 RPG Witch - At this level, you’ll receive a PDF of all the stat sheets of some of the unique races in the Witching World, such as black phoenixes and Questing Beasts, for use in your next campaign.</p><p>$150 Spellcaster - You’ll receive a personalized spell card and a candle from Renew Candles. The candle will be unique to the spell you intend to cast.</p><p>$250 New Student - This reward is a complete welcome packet from Medusa Gorgon’s Academy for Young Witches. It will include a sticker set, a welcome letter from Medusa, a mug, a school shirt, the tea blend from Friday Afternoon, a personalized spell card, tarot decks, D&amp;D Stat Sheets for the Witching World, and a flash drive with a music playlist as well as Medusa Gorgon’s Academy for Young Witches in its entirety so you can listen to it a month earlier than everyone else.</p><p>At every 5% level raised, another two cast members will be revealed and another riddle will be given. If you solve the riddles, something else may be waiting for you…</p><p> </p><p><strong>And what if we surpass that amount?</strong> (<a href=""https://media.giphy.com/media/26BRwW3ckGjcZmsxO/giphy.gif"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://media.giphy.com/media/26BRwW3ckGjcZmsxO...</a>)</p><p>I will cry. I mean, I’ll cry either way as I’m a Pisces and we can get VERY emotional, but if you manage to surpass the amount, I will bawl my eyes out and more rewards will go to everyone.</p><p>At $5,000, I will send EVERYONE, regardess of level, a CD of the songs that inspired my projects and the specific music for the characters.</p><p>At $6,000, we’ll do a backer-exclusive livestream of a few of our recording sessions, a full listen to the first episode as soon as it’s mastered, and of the launch party.</p><p>At $7,000, I will GM a game of your choice in my world, giving you a sneaky peak into the stories, plots, riddles, worlds to come. Also fun.</p><p>At $8,000, you’ll be one of the first to read my maanuscript that I will be publishing under this production company entitled Extraordinarily Ordinary.</p><p>At $10,000, we will put on a live show in Seattle! And any backer unable to attend will receive a recording of it.</p><p>Any amount over $10,000 is pretty impossible. I challenge you to prove me wrong. ;)</p><p> </p><p>Also what do you know about audio fiction and why should I trust you with my money?</p><p>I’ll be honest, I’m no expert but I have had two years of experience as an audio fiction producer. In those two years, I have:</p><p>Started a podcast, put together a trailer and a first episode all by myself (writing, directing, editing, mastering, etc), put those out, then started rewriting from the beginning</p><p>Rewritten Medusa’s like Inn Between by Hannah Wright, gone to PodCon 2 with a friend of mine where I met the wonderful Sean Howard and Eli McIlveen of Fable and Folly Productions as well as the amazing Elena Fernandez-Collins of the Bello Collective in person, learned a lot about being a podcast producer, and then started to use what I learned to improve my craft.</p><p>Hired a few new actresses to join the cast, recorded the rewrite and started editing, realized I didn’t like the direction, and scrapped it.</p><p>Spent a semester focused on novel writing for my senior project and started world-building and the Nine Realms were born in my mind.</p><p>Started rewriting Medusa’s for the third time, fallen in love with the new story, and expanded the world FAR beyond the reaches of my Nine Realms.</p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>The main reason I, Rachel Rauch, started working on this podcast was because I wanted to build an inclusive and comedic story around witches and magical school life, but it’s become so much more. I was disappointed in Harry Potter and I was in love with Alba Salix: Royal Physician. I wanted more stories like Alba Salix, stories that make people laugh and build a community.</p><p>After listening to Kalila Stormfire’s Economical Magickal Services and after recently rewatching Jim Henson’s The Storyteller, I realized the type of story I needed to tell. I needed to tell a story that was accurate in its handling of magic, built a bridge, and gave voice to those in the POC and queer communities; not a story that tore people down with its blatant lack of diverse representation. I believe that there is a better, more inclusive story to be told, and that is what I intend to do with this podcast collection. Give the listener funny, FANTASTIC!!!, magical stories for a purpose that the audience can participate in, and I hope it leaves them with a feeling of having a voice and agency in this world and story.</p><p>This story is a genuine attempt at giving voice and power to the those who feel voiceless and gives hope when things feel hopeless. If a door closes, you can turn into a phoenix of death and burn it down. If you start feeling pulled towards the darkness, it’s never too late to turn your life back around. If you feel a little unloved, know you are never alone.</p><p><strong>What’s going to stand in the way?</strong></p><p>Well, hopefully nothing, but that’s not realistic because with every creative project, there are going to be hurdles that you must get over in order to get to your ultimate goal. The trick is that one must persevere always. Then again, nothing is worth doing if there’s no challenge or risk involved.</p><p>In all honesty, I feel like this experience has given me a lot of confidence in life and in podcasting. When I first started, I had problems with control and tended to take charge of a project. I still do that but it’s been turned into a strength instead of a weakness. It’s what makes me a good showrunner, but I also trust my cast and crew enough to make decisions for themselves and take my words and transform the story and the characters to fit them.</p><p>I also tended to be a bit of a perfectionist and still am. It’s a part of the control freak in me. I’ve scrapped this project two times previous because I really didn’t like the way the story was structured and the world needed to be more built up. In doing so, it taught me the skills I needed to be a good showrunner, my perfectionism and attention to detail allowed me to figure out exactly what I needed and what I wanted to hear and get out of my projects. </p><p>I believe that every setback and risk also teaches you something. Every challenge can be used to reach further success. You just have to be willing to learn.</p><p><strong>And what do I do if I can’t contribute monetarily? Or where can I find you on the World Wide Witch Web?</strong></p><p>If you can't contribute to the podcast with money, you can still help us. You can follow us on Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram and spread the word to your friends, family, coworkers, and acquaintances. We’ve posted the trailers on iTunes so you can listen to it and give us a good review. Subscribe and you'll be notified whenever we publish a new episode. We hope that you will join us on this magical and drama-filled comedical journey and we cannot wait to share this story with the rest of the world.</p><p>Thank you!! And please enjoy the trailers for Medusa Gorgon's Academy for Young Witches!!</p></div>","Who am I? Who AM I?I am a person. Just like any other person. But the one thing that sets me apart is that I am a Storyteller, and I have a want, a NEED to create a story. A story that stretches across history and shows how the choices we make have the power to affect the world around us, for better or for worse.My name is Rachel Rauch and I am a nonbinary female who uses she/her, they/them pronouns. I’m the showrunner for Storytellers and the founder of the future Nine Realm Productions production house. I write about queernorm fantasy worlds that are heartfelt, hopeful, and very very magical while also confronting the truth. When I’m not writing, that’s like saying “when I’m not living,” but when I’m not writing, I’m drinking tea, watching movies, and reading books. Oh, and working a day job on the side. Just a regular 40 hour a week side gig, no big.In all honesty, though, I would really not do any of this work without the help of my AWESOME cast and crew members. They are my REAL #PodernFamily, and it’s kind of a wonder why they agreed to help me with this. SO the least I can do is pay them for all the wonderful work they’re doing for me and that’s why I need YOUR help. As for the names of some of these wonderful people? Well they will be revealed in due time... So... enough about the people behind the curtain.

Instead of turning on Pandora or Spotify, listen to us!Lastly, to make this a reality, we are also going to be making an easy to use Channel Zero phone app. We live in an age where the power of the mainstream media, historically aligned with neo-liberalism and the Democratic Party is falling. The gap that it is leaving is being filled by a host of other medias. While revolutionary anarchist media is growing in size, at the same time, so are our enemies on the far-Right. Creating engaging and exciting shows and podcasts is part of winning this battle and in order to do that, we need exciting, beautiful, and engaging platforms, projects, and content. We are asking for your help in getting this off the ground.We will use the funds raised to pay for the first year of hosting for the 24-7 streaming audio and related infrastructure costs.  By supporting this campaign you are supporting the launch of the network itself, not individual podcasters who are all currently self funded.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Anthony ""Antman"" Shafer my background is factory work but after a life threatening accident I had to start over. Music saved my life and I want to save someone else's. After my accident I had no direction and I found it in supporting music, musicians and like wise the professionals of the industry.</p>
<p>This Campaign is important to me because I feel that music saves lives through the message and the experience of being able to capture those moments in a bottle for someone across the world who maybe in the military or that dad or mom who has never seen their kid play live!</p>
<p>Our goal is $1100 dollars we plan on buying (List Below)</p>
<p>50 inch Tripod, 2 memory cards, Camera Bag, Premiere Elements, 2 Cameras- Panasonic Lumix FZ80 4k Cameras, desktop tripod, Light Boxes for cameras, Attachable Microphones</p>
</div><div><p>THE PERKS YOU ASK? Local Interviews, Local Reviews of Locations, Better quality video for promotional content. The perks are endless and I'm open to ideas on how to grow and willing to collaborate and educate. If we don't reach our goal the funds will go towards what we can afford and we will try again for the remaining of what we need whatever that is.</p></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of this project is massive in a way because we can unite people around the world through music and further the support and empowerment of our local scene. Then we are local to even the military men and women for messages on holidays and kids in hospitals as well as charity work and oh so much more. I've had success in the past with events and supporting of the local scene on countless occasions for charities and fundraisers as well as attempting to save my own moms life by doing three cancer benefits which raised $3000 dollars. I am real about my craft and I love what I do. I'm truly fortunate to be here after 3 suicide attempts and fighting to stay clean for over 4 years.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks are like anything in life if you never try you will never succeed. I don't look at risks that seriously because I'm not going to set myself up to fail. However the challenges will be getting everyone to feel as passionate as I do to the point they want to support something larger than themselves. In today's day and age its hard to find real honest people. It's true you pick your crowds and learn what works and what doesn't for your business. </p>

<h3>The former Tumblr community deserves a social networking app and website worthy of their unique needs.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Introducing Hierarchy, an app and website designed with the male fetish community in mind. <br/><br/>This ambitious project has been conceived by the owner of a Tumblr blog with 70,000+ followers. With the demise of Tumblr, these followers have been set adrift, lost and alone. </h3>
<h3>Hierarchy will solve that problem.

<ul>
<li><p>Community - creators and their audiences should be connected and engaged, and seeking ways to make their communities better (both locally and globally)</p></li>
<li><p>Vulnerability - we should never be afraid to go deeper, even when the subject matter seems goofy or trivial. Podcasting is an intimate medium, so let’s act like it.</p></li>
<li><p>Diversity - we have a Zero Tolerance Policy for things like racism and homophobia. Because it’s 2021. Keep that weak garbage out of here. If you don’t feel safe listening to one of our shows, please contact us to let us know.</p></li>
<li><p>Accessibility - we’re really committed to the idea that this medium should be accessible to as many people as possible. That’s why our main studio and our editing services operate on a sliding scale basis and offer discounted rates for Registered Non-Profits. We’re also aiming to get set up with a Transcription service as soon as we have the budget for it, so that the deaf &amp; hard-of-hearing can enjoy our content as well.</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our main studio has been using a 10-year-old iMac for all of its recording &amp; editing for the past three years, and that machine is on its last legs. We need your help to buy a new one, and to fund some other cool projects we've got in the works! We're aiming to raise a minimum of $2500 as our main goal, and we have some great stretch goals lined up as well! By donating, you'll get:</p>
<ul>
<li>All kinds of awesome perks, including, but not limited to, merch, social media shoutouts, episode dedications, topic requests, advertising space, guest appearances, and more!</li>
<li>An NPC named after you on our network's Dungeons &amp; Dragons podcast, Natural Toonie!</li>
<li>The joy of knowing you helped a small, queer-led business stay afloat during a global pandemic!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In addition to buying a new computer for our main studio, your donations will also go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying for Transcription Services so that we can make our content more accessible for the deaf &amp; hard of hearing! (Included in our main goal)</li>
<li>Launching an internship program to train a member of our community on full-scale podcast production and <strong>actually be able to pay them, because unpaid internships are nonsense! </strong>(stretch goal)</li>
<li>And, 20% of our proceeds above our main fundraising goal will be donated to local food banks &amp; shelters in our community! (Stretch goal)</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>Some people just can't afford to contribute financially, and that's totally okay! Other ways you can help include:</p>

It's time to make my return to the show and film a series of travel vlogs and interviews with my favorite people in the greeting card industry. The Stationery Show is an industry exclusive event, but my series of videos will give snail mail lovers a peek behind the curtain at the correspondence magic! I can (and will!) bring this magical place to life for you through my videos. </p><p>Unfortunately, Seattle is far from New York, and it’s expensive to get there and stay there. As a small, independent retailer, it's not easy to find the extra cash to travel cross-country for a tradeshow. And so, I’m raising money for the travel expenses to go to the show. To keep expenses as low as possible, I'm making this a whirlwind 36 hour trip with only one night in a hotel. </p><p>Any money raised above the goal will go towards purchasing a microphone that I can use to improve my audio and video game while I’m on the road.</p></div>","The National Stationery Show in New York City is the hub of all things stationery and snail mail.

<p>Take a wild ride with the soldiers of the Deep Space Colonial Marines (DSCM) as they battle mystery, uncertainty, and peril at every turn!</p>
<p>While on a routine patrol of the outer rim territories, the starship DSCM Protector encounters trouble and is forced to dock at a mysterious station for repairs. Receiving no communication from inside the station, Lieutenant Abigail Kelly, known to her soldiers simply as LT, leads Alpha Squad into the station to investigate. What they find could put them all in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Find out what happens on this wild journey over the action-packed 8-episode season!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>About the Project</strong></h3>
<p>I'm a music composer and a HUGE science fiction fan! I've always wanted to work on a sci-fi project as a composer and now is the perfect time. I have created my own sci-fi series set in the outskirts of the known universe! Beyond the Belt: Adventures from the Outer Rim is a series of 8 episodes all told from the different perspectives of characters sharing an intergalactic experience in deep space. They are regular people just like you and me. With spaceships, laboratories, explosions, mystery, and suspense included!</p>
<p>The first episode sets the stage for a wild adventure, and with each chapter, more details are revealed until the exciting conclusion! This is not just a podcast--it's an ADVENTURE! And YOU can be a part of it from the very beginning!</p>
<p>There are voiced characters, original music, narration, and sound effects. It has the feel of an old-time radio show that you couldn't wait to tune in for every week.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Every dollar is going from your wallet into the hands of a master craftsperson--voice actors, musicians, recording engineers, illustrators, and more. You are helping pay dozens of artists during a time that has been tough on us all.</li>
<li>This project is a life-long dream of mine! It allows me to work with people, music, and storytelling in a way that I have always dreamed of, and to do it in the medium of science fiction, which I LOVE!</li>
<li>Chapter 1 is already finished! It's amazing and I can't wait to share the entire series with you!</li>
<li>Your contribution will make this project a gigantic success! That means hiring more people for the creative roles and production, and releasing the stories on a set schedule as soon as they are finished!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>It's a BIG Galaxy! Your contribution plays a critical role in the creation of new worlds and dramatic settings for each episode by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making it possible for voice actors and actresses to record their parts so the episodes can be assembled.</li>
<li>Providing funding for musicians and recording engineers to record the amazing music for each episode.</li>
<li>Allowing recording engineers to capture music and dialog, and combine them into new, living, breathing creations.</li>
<li>Hiring illustrators to create companion materials for the series.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><i><u>YOU</u></i></strong> will be bringing the entire 8-episode series to completion! </p>
<p>I absolutely cannot wait to share Beyond The Belt with you!</p>

<h3>Do Other People Want This Too?</h3>

<p>Podcasting is a broad medium, which is a fancy way of saying that there are a LOT of people podcasting. Some have humongous audiences, others do not.

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Do I have to have a podcast to attend?</strong><br/>Very no! We’ll have content for people who make podcasts, but the majority of stuff at PodCon is for fans of podcasts (which, of course, includes everyone who makes podcasts.) Many panel discussions will be interesting to all audiences, and all of our main-stage content will be. </p>
<p><strong>What if the IndieGoGo doesn’t reach its goal?</strong><br/>We may have been a little ambitious...we will see. But if this thing doesn’t reach its goal, we will still make PodCon and it will be amazing. There are some cool things we won't be able to do, and some cool people we won't be able to fly out, but everything we've promised here so far is <i>definitely happening.</i></p>
<p><strong>Will I be able to get this stuff after the IndieGoGo ends?</strong><br/>Some of it? Yes. Tickets will still be available (everything will cost 10% more) as well as swag bags. But everything above the $125 swag bag level will not be available, including the magical thumb drive. Everything under (and including) the $125 level will be available through this campaign. </p>
<p><strong>What podcasts will have live shows at PodCon?</strong><br/>This list will be updated as we continue to grow our list of featured podcasters but: Lore, Bad with Money, Dear Hank and John, MBMBaM, Alice Isn’t Dead, Criminal, Sawbones, and Still Buffering.</p>
<p><strong>No Night Vale Live Show?</strong><br/>Because of the complexity of a full-stage show of Night Vale, they’ll be doing a separately ticketed event in Seattle before or after PodCon. However, the full Night Vale cast will be at the event and participating in panels, workshops, and performances.</p>
<p><strong>Can I upgrade my perk in the future if I have more money?</strong><br/>Yes, but not automatically. You’ll need to email us at info@podcon.com</p>
<p><strong>I have a podcast, can I get involved?</strong><br/>Obviously, there are a huge number of amazing and popular podcasts out there.

<p><strong>How does priority seating work?</strong><br/>Before a panel or event begins, a priority seating area will be set aside. These seats are not assigned, and there is a chance that they will all fill. They will have a better than average view of the stage / content, and they will be fairly numerous. Ten minutes before the content is scheduled to begin, these sections will be opened to all attendees, so your seat is only saved if you show up before the content, not forever. </p>
<p><strong>Will there be a chance for meet-ups and autographs?</strong><br/>We’re actually not sure yet. For now, assume “no”.</p>
<p><b>This actually sounds really great, why haven't I backed this thing yet?</b><br/>We have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any other way I can help?</strong><br/>Podcasts have always relied on the kindness of word-of-mouth marketing...and so is PodCon. Please, tell all of your podcast-loving friends that there is a very limited-time offer happening, and we really want them at this event. </p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Hello, we are Casey and Marley and together we make up Project Divided. We are two everyday Americans who have found ourselves overwhelmed and frustrated by political polarization and the bitter divisiveness of politics today.</p>
<p>Like you, we have our own political views and values that are non-negotiable—but at the end of the day, we must initiate conversations with people of opposing viewpoints. After all, we believe that most Americans are actually somewhere in the middle, even though we’ve been pushed to the extremes.</p>

<p>So what are we doing about this? We are taking this idea on the road to Smithville, Texas where we will be filming short documentary-style interviews with voters from across the political spectrum.</p>
<p>Texas represents the changing, and often clashing, identities of our country, making it the perfect place to begin! Our ultimate goal is to create a space for civil discourse, where we can highlight our similarities rather than our differences. We don't have to agree on everything--and we won't--but in the end, we are all American and our country and communities benefit from open and honest dialogue.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>We need your help. Currently, this project is completely self-funded and in order for the two of us to dedicate ourselves full-time to this start-up campaign, we need your support. We are a small, two-woman run team. This means that your contribution has a <i>large </i>impact. We are operating on a bare-bones budget and are only seeking funding for the necessities. Every dollar that is contributed will go directly to our living and production expenses, including our housing, filming equipment, and travel expenses.</p>
<p>On a larger scale, your donation will work towards creating content that the media is failing to provide. Conflict and division are great for television ratings and riling up political bases; however, they are not beneficial for our democracy. Project Divided will fill this gap. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>We Value Your Opinion</h3>
<p>We are learning as we go, and will probably make mistakes. We promise to always be open to hearing constructive criticism and differing opinions. Always feel free to reach out to us and share your thoughts--you are part of the conversation too!</p>

<p>Your engagement in this campaign is our greatest asset. We cannot do this alone! So, please comment, subscribe, share, and spread the word about Project Divided. Together we can bridge the divide. </p>
</div></div>","Who We Are
Hello, we are Casey and Marley and together we make up Project Divided. We are two everyday Americans who have found ourselves overwhelmed and frustrated by political polarization and the bitter divisiveness of politics today.
Like you, we have our own political views and values that are non-negotiable—but at the end of the day, we must initiate conversations with people of opposing viewpoints. After all, we believe that most Americans are actually somewhere in the middle, even though we’ve been pushed to the extremes.

<h3>Meet The Production Team:</h3>
<p><u><strong>James Oliva - Writer/Creator/Director</strong></u></p>
<p>From the time James was a little boy he was weird. He would spend his days dreaming of night and his nights dreaming of breaking reality. This didn't change any by the time he reached adulthood. In fact he got weirder. As we understand it, James is betting that you are just as weird as he is and you'd like to have more of that in your life. <br/><br/><u><strong>Alexander Danner - Sound Designer</strong></u></p>
<p>What's The Frequency? has been Alexander's first foray into experimental sound design. In a short period of time he has gone on to be regarded as one of the most exciting and innovative sound designers around. Regularly making year end lists for best sound design and earning Audio Verse Awards wins and nominations as well. Though Alexander wouldn't be half the designer he is without the help of James, it is widely believed that he SHOULD be paid for his efforts. </p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Our priority above all else is to pay our actors. They are seriously some of the most talented people around. We must confess... our cast is very large... like HUGE. We had 47 roles in season one alone and plan to bring a few new people aboard this year.</p>
<p>Here is how the funds will be dispersed:<br/><br/>Main Cast: $250 per actor = $1,500</p>
<p>Supporting Cast: $100 per actor = $1,100<br/><br/>Guest Actors: $25 per actor = $750 </p>
<p>So to cover the actor fees we will need to raise $3,350.</p>
<p>It's also important that we pay some of the team members behind the scenes. </p>
<p>Season One Composer - Kurt C. Nelson: $250 </p>
<p>Season Two Additional Music - Head Dress and others: $500 </p>
<p>Season One and Two Sound Designer - Alexander Danner $250 (Requested zero pay. Was denied.)</p>
<p>Additional Art - $150</p>
<p>For production team members costs will be $1,150<br/><br/>Total needed to fund season two is: $4,500 </p>

We are looking to raise $5,000 CAD to be able to keep our dice rolling. The funds raised in this campaign will be allocated into the following:
Indiegogo's Cut (5% of all earnings).
Equipment upgrades.
Marketing: Website hosting fees, character art, merch, and ad spaces.
Production: Podcast hosting service, editing software.
Unforeseen costs associated with the podcast.
GUESTS! As the podcast grows, we will be bringing in more and more guests to embark on fun adventures with us! We value our guests so very much and the ability to compensate them for their time shows them that.
Pay our team! As of right now, we are pouring our time, sweat, money and tears into this project's success. Tabletop Tiddies is not just a passion project, but something we want to see grow and continue on for many years to come.

<p>Welcome, Campers!</p> <p>Do you enjoy Dungeons and Dragons but think it needs more teen drinking, summer camp pranks, and soul-crushing self-realizations?</p>
<p> Nat Camp combines all these elements in an improvised narrative podcast best described as “Dungeons and Dragons meets Role Models meets Ernest Goes To Camp.”</p> <p>Similar to other Dungeons and Dragons podcasts, Nat Camp is an actual-play storytelling experience using the D&amp;D 5e rules as a framework.</p>
<p>Taking place at a fictional summer camp nestled outside a rural mining town, our players will improvise as counselors; rolling dice to determine what they can and cannot do.</p> <p>Pack your bags as we transport you into a world of swords and sorcery that has progressed to a new age. There WILL be epic fights with freaky monsters, the party WILL attempt to sneak around only to step on the world’s loudest stick, and somebody’s mattress WILL inevitably be pushed onto the lake.</p>
<p>This world goes beyond classic medieval fantasy, transcending into an age of enlightenment where monsters need slaying and lost ruins lay untouched, waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p>Despite peace and safety within the nation’s borders, many children still yearn for adventure and danger. At Nat Camp, adventure and danger are guaranteed. (under counselor supervision, of course)</p>
<p>The counselors, played by our cast members, aren’t exactly traditional. In fact, they consist of a socially awkward wizard, a glamour-rock half-orc, a dwarf corps cadet with a superiority complex, and beatnik satyr bard.</p>
<p>Despite their eccentricities, each counselor wants to give the campers they are responsible for the best summer ever... and maybe even leave a lasting impression.</p>

<h3>Why We're Here</h3>
<p>We’re two sisters who share a passion for horror movies. We are also a high-school student and a 22-year-old with an unpaid internship, so we don’t have much in the way of start-up funds.</p>
<p>With your contribution, we can share our love for these (mostly pretty terrible) films with the rest of the world. Franchise by franchise, film by film, we’ll discuss these movies and try and get to the bottom of what makes them so appealing, and what makes them oh so wrong. Every other week, we’ll bring you episodes that ask all of the hard-hitting questions, like, “What’s with all the weird butt-touching in Friday the 13th?” and “Why does Freddie Krueger have arms like one of those inflatable tube things outside of a car dealership?” And if we can’t answer the questions ourselves, we’ll bring in a guest expert… who may or may not be an actual expert, but is definitely someone we know with tangential knowledge on the subject.</p>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499089125/ybgivgf5hvw0a5gxoq9a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Cordie, left, and Theo, right. This is pretty much how it always is.</i></p>
<p>Theo’s love of the horror genre began with Hitchcock films at the age of 13. Unlike most people, her taste devolved over the next 9 years, and landed her here. Theo recently graduated from Smith College with a degree in anthropology, and hopes to spend her life studying skeletons. Not in a scary way.</p>
<p>Cordie is older than she looks, so don't call her out for watching R-rated movies. She's an Aries who loves horses and other animals, dance, and Harry Styles. She believes in her heart that Jason is innocent.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There are a few things that we simply cannot make a podcast without. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two microphones</li>
<li>A subscription to a podcast-hosting website</li>
<li>Artwork for our logo</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these costs are flexible, but we estimate that they will come in somewhere around $200-250. If we could make that much money, that would be incredible. But, there are a few things on top of that that we would love to have money for, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better microphones!</li>
<li>An actual domain name</li>
<li>Editing software and other recording equipment</li>
<li>Advertising and podcast promotion</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of the amount we raise, every contribution to this campaign will go towards the production of this podcast.</p>
<p>If you donate to this project, we would like to express our gratitude in a tangible and/or public manner. Check out our perks section to see all of the cool gifts that you can get!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Horror commentary is a fairly male-dominated field, so we're hoping that this podcast will bring a new perspective to the table. Whether you've never seen these movies, watched them all awhile ago, or literally watch at least one of them every single day of your life, this podcast will give you a new way to enjoy these films.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can’t donate, that’s okay! We totally get it, and there are lots of other ways you can help us. For now, the best way you can help us is to share this campaign. If you know people you think might enjoy our show, please tell them about it! And feel free to share on social media.</p>
<p>And once the show gets started, there's even more you can do to help! We'll have social media pages to like, an itunes page for ratings and reviews, and, of course, a podcast to listen to and share with your friends!</p>

Cordie is older than she looks, so don't call her out for watching R-rated movies. She's an Aries who loves horses and other animals, dance, and Harry Styles. She believes in her heart that Jason is innocent.

What We Need & What You Get
There are a few things that we simply cannot make a podcast without. These include:

Two microphones
A subscription to a podcast-hosting website
Artwork for our logo

Many of these costs are flexible, but we estimate that they will come in somewhere around $200-250. If we could make that much money, that would be incredible. But, there are a few things on top of that that we would love to have money for, including:

Better microphones!
An actual domain name
Editing software and other recording equipment
Advertising and podcast promotion

Regardless of the amount we raise, every contribution to this campaign will go towards the production of this podcast.
If you donate to this project, we would like to express our gratitude in a tangible and/or public manner. Check out our perks section to see all of the cool gifts that you can get!

The Impact
Horror commentary is a fairly male-dominated field, so we're hoping that this podcast will bring a new perspective to the table. Whether you've never seen these movies, watched them all awhile ago, or literally watch at least one of them every single day of your life, this podcast will give you a new way to enjoy these films.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can’t donate, that’s okay! We totally get it, and there are lots of other ways you can help us. For now, the best way you can help us is to share this campaign. If you know people you think might enjoy our show, please tell them about it! And feel free to share on social media.
And once the show gets started, there's even more you can do to help! We'll have social media pages to like, an itunes page for ratings and reviews, and, of course, a podcast to listen to and share with your friends!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Accession: Homeward</h2>
<h3>Accession is back for season two, hitting the road in search of home.</h3>
<p>My name is Ponders, and for the last year, I have been making a podcast called Accession, helping museums and art come to life with story and sound. In each episode I take a piece of art and try to find the story that helps me feel connected to it, so that I can help you find that connection too. Accession approaches art in ways that you would never expect, and season one let me look at art as near as my own backyard and as far away as the moon.</p>
<p>But with season two, I want to hone in the the scope of the show and focus on one thing. Season two will be titled Accession: Homeward.</p>
<p>Home is a really common theme in art. When we’re kids, the picture of a home, just a square with a triangle roof is one of the easiest things to draw. Home come up surprisingly often in art, and everyone has their own understanding of what exactly a home is. And right now I’m looking for the next place that I’m going to call home. So I decided to combine my search for a home with my love of art museums in the form of a road trip!</p>
<p>That’s right, Accession is hitting the road! I want to drive from Massachusetts to Seattle through Texas. We’ll hit 10 major cities, and 16 different museums to look at all the kinds of art that draw us homeward. It will be me and my fellow writer and friend Ana Madsen, who is coming along partialy as a documentarian and producer, but mostly as a body guard. And in each major museum we go to, we’ll have a meet up, where you can come to the museum with me and be a part of the making of season two!</p>
<p>But this is where I need your help! Every contribution you make will go towards making this road trip a success and helping to fund the production costs of a 10 episode season.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p>The path of the trip will take us to New York and DC, Charlotte, Atlanta, Birmingham, New Orleans, Dallas, Santa Fe, Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle. Along the way we will visiting 15 different museums and locations, the names of which we will reveal as the campaign gets funded!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557498271/jw2gqvgpjeaa3hmnkiq9.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Food- $600</h3>
<ul><li>Obviously this is hard to approximate exactly, and we plan on having food that we can bring with us from place to place to cook, but we figure $600 will give us a good amount to work with for 20 days of travel.</li></ul>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
<p>If we are able to reach $4000, the entire season will be funded without a penny coming out of my pocket, and with not a penny going into it. Every bit the money earned is going towards artists, actors, guests, and musicians who will make this season amazing. As such, we want to offer you so pretty cool stretch goals. </p>
<h3>Ponders Will Wear Sunglasses- $2550</h3>
<p>Sunglasses are great right?  They protect your eyes from harmful UV rays, they make you look cool, they pull your outfit together.  Sunglasses are the perfect summer accessory. Unless of course you are T.H. Ponders. Ponders hates sunglasses.  They hate sunglasses with the fiery burning passion of a thousand suns.  The irony is not lost. That’s why for this stretch goal, Ponders will make the ultimate sacrifice for you.  They will purchase, and wear, a pair of sunglasses. Aviators no less: the most sunglassesy of sunglasses. As a backer you will receive photographic evidence of Ponders in sunglasses at every stop they make. It will probably be hilarious.</p>
<h3>The World’s Largest Mini-Series- $2750</h3>
<p>One of the staples of driving across the country is how many places tout to have the ""World's Largest _________""- and of course, Ponder's thinks of all of these things as art. If we can get to $2750, Ponders will put together a mini-series that will be released concurrently with Homeward that will feature such novelties as the the World's Largest Hat in Dallas, the World Largest Van Gogh painting in Goodland, Kansas, and the World's Largest Collection of World's Largest Items. </p>
<h3>Ponders Does an Art Heist- $3000</h3>
<p>You read that right. Ponders will do an art heist. He has a few in mind, but we'll make sure that its extra exciting for your listening pleasure. Because who doesn't like it when a podcaster talks about an art heist? That's right. There is an art heist true crime episode when we reach $3000.</p>
<h3>Audio is Dead! Long Live Print Media!- $3500</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that podcasts are on the out and that print media is the only thing that will live forever. At $3500 I will be able to produce a zine for season two, with original art, highlights from the season, and original pieces of writing. There will be a print and digital copy and all backers who are being shipped anything ($10 tier and above) will receive a signed physical copy.</p>
<h3>Print Media is Dead! Long Live Audio!- $4000</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that print media is on the out and that audio is the only thing that will live forever. But audio as a medium still can be pushed. There are whole new frontiers to explore. And Ponders wants to do that. I have three projects on the list that are extra special episodes of Accession, episodes that will redefine the show, redefine the potential of art education, and possibly even redefine what is and is not a podcast. Sounds like a bunch of pretentious pie in the sky thinking? It is. Which is why if we reach $4000, I'm going to enact the first of these plans: an interactive episode of Accession. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>Listen, we’re not naive.  We know that a project of this magnitude has a lot of room for things to go sidewise, especially where travel is involved.  Some of our potential challenges include: car trouble, accommodation problems, illness, injury, traffic delays, storms, natural disasters, and just plain old bad luck. All of these could result in us not staying on schedule or possible having to cut certain items from our planned itinerary.  If something does prevent us from hitting a certain gallery or venue, it could affect how we are able to fill perks. We will try our best to make sure that doesn’t happen, but we can’t control the roads or the weather. We value openness and honesty, so if something like this happens our backers will be the first to know</p>
<p>That said we are both incredibly determined (some might even say stubborn), and resourceful. We know how to problem solve and we’re good at coming up with solutions.  If stuff happens on the road we’ll roll with it and keep right on trucking (or vanning, in this case). We take our responsibility to our backers incredibly seriously and we want to make sure you feel good about supporting our cross-country escapades.</p>
<p>Other more run of the mill challenges include unforseen production delays in terms of getting merchandise for perks made, delays in perk fulfillment, and shipping issues.  Unfortunately once your perk is in the hands of the U.S. Postal system we have very little control over whether it gets to you and the condition in which it arrives.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>None of our perks tickled your fancy?  Just don’t have the spare pocket change to join the road trip? We know that you might not be able to contribute financially and that’s ok!  Even if you don’t pledge there are lots of things you can do to help us out.</p>
<p>You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let other people know about our campaign.  Word of mouth goes a long way!</li>
<li>Tweet about us using the hashtag #AccessionHomeward or share a picture of what reminds you of home on #HomewardWednesdays</li>
<li>Follow us @accessionfm on social media (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook)</li>
<li>Listen to Accession and recommend the show to your friends</li>

There will be some good road trip timelapse shots, video of Ponders and Ana posing in front of things, and discussion of our favorite parts of the trip. It’ll be like you’re right there playing Eye Spy with us every day of the trip. Plus all the perks listed above!

Selfie Snapper- Polaroids ($30) (Limit 20)

You're supporting the season at $3 per episode PLUS
Ana has a deep and abiding love of polaroids and cannot wait to send your three one-of-a-kind polaroids from the road. No two pictures will be the same. Plus the stickers and the digital perks!

Nap Taker- Postcards ($30) (Limit 20)

You're supporting the season at $3 per episode PLUS
Ponders is obsessed with postcards. They have a whole wall of them that move from home to home. If you like postcards as much as Ponders, you’re not going to want to miss out on three postcards from three different stops along the road! Plus the stickers and the digital perks!

Backseat Driver- Commentaries and a Bumper Sticker ($50) (Limit 50)

You're supporting the season at $5 per episode PLUS
You get it all! The playlist, the stickers, the vlog, a polaroid, a postcard, PLUS a bumper sticker and Director’s Commentaries as the season comes out. This is the full Accession: Homeward bundle!

Snack Getter- Exclusive Accession: Homeward Art Print ($75) (Limit 30)

You're supporting the season at $7.50 per episode PLUS
At this tier you get all of the cool perks from before, but also a beautiful print of the Season 2 art, signed by T.H. Ponders and the artist, V Silverman. These prints are going to be so nice you’ll want to frame them and hang them in your own museum.

Gift Shopper- Care Package ($100) (Limit 5)

You're supporting the season at $10 per episode PLUS
Is your favorite place at every stop the gift shop? Then this is the tier for you. You’ll get to look over our itinerary, pick a stop, and at that stop we’ll put together a care package of souvenirs and trinkets for you! (You also get the art print and the full Accession: Homeward Bundle!)

The Navigator- Accession on Vinyl ($150) (Limit 10)

You're supporting the season at $15 per episode PLUS
Ponders will be writing and recording an episode of Accession that will only ever be released on Vinyl, never online, and there will only be 20 copies printed. The only way to listen to this episode is to support this IndieGoGo at this tier or know someone who has. This is a one of a kind podcast! (You also get the art print and the full Accession: Homeward Bundle!)

Take the Wheel- Season Producer ($200) (Limit 5)

You're supporting the season at $20 per episode PLUS
You are a producer on the season and your name is said on every episode. You’ll have early access to every episode and transcripts, as well as special updates just for you on the inner workings and choices of each episode of the season. Also you’ll get a sneak peak of two brand new podcast projects long before anyone else. (You also get either the vinyl or a care package, the art print, and the Accession: Homeward Bundle!)

 
Stretch Goals
If we are able to reach $4000, the entire season will be funded without a penny coming out of my pocket, and with not a penny going into it. Every bit the money earned is going towards artists, actors, guests, and musicians who will make this season amazing. As such, we want to offer you so pretty cool stretch goals. 
Ponders Will Wear Sunglasses- $2550
Sunglasses are great right?  They protect your eyes from harmful UV rays, they make you look cool, they pull your outfit together.  Sunglasses are the perfect summer accessory. Unless of course you are T.H. Ponders. Ponders hates sunglasses.  They hate sunglasses with the fiery burning passion of a thousand suns.  The irony is not lost. That’s why for this stretch goal, Ponders will make the ultimate sacrifice for you.  They will purchase, and wear, a pair of sunglasses. Aviators no less: the most sunglassesy of sunglasses. As a backer you will receive photographic evidence of Ponders in sunglasses at every stop they make. It will probably be hilarious.
The World’s Largest Mini-Series- $2750
One of the staples of driving across the country is how many places tout to have the ""World's Largest _________""- and of course, Ponder's thinks of all of these things as art. If we can get to $2750, Ponders will put together a mini-series that will be released concurrently with Homeward that will feature such novelties as the the World's Largest Hat in Dallas, the World Largest Van Gogh painting in Goodland, Kansas, and the World's Largest Collection of World's Largest Items. 
Ponders Does an Art Heist- $3000
You read that right. Ponders will do an art heist. He has a few in mind, but we'll make sure that its extra exciting for your listening pleasure. Because who doesn't like it when a podcaster talks about an art heist? That's right. There is an art heist true crime episode when we reach $3000.
Audio is Dead! Long Live Print Media!- $3500
Everyone knows that podcasts are on the out and that print media is the only thing that will live forever. At $3500 I will be able to produce a zine for season two, with original art, highlights from the season, and original pieces of writing. There will be a print and digital copy and all backers who are being shipped anything ($10 tier and above) will receive a signed physical copy.
Print Media is Dead! Long Live Audio!- $4000
Everyone knows that print media is on the out and that audio is the only thing that will live forever. But audio as a medium still can be pushed. There are whole new frontiers to explore. And Ponders wants to do that. I have three projects on the list that are extra special episodes of Accession, episodes that will redefine the show, redefine the potential of art education, and possibly even redefine what is and is not a podcast. Sounds like a bunch of pretentious pie in the sky thinking? It is. Which is why if we reach $4000, I'm going to enact the first of these plans: an interactive episode of Accession. 
 
Risks & Challenges
Listen, we’re not naive.  We know that a project of this magnitude has a lot of room for things to go sidewise, especially where travel is involved.  Some of our potential challenges include: car trouble, accommodation problems, illness, injury, traffic delays, storms, natural disasters, and just plain old bad luck. All of these could result in us not staying on schedule or possible having to cut certain items from our planned itinerary.  If something does prevent us from hitting a certain gallery or venue, it could affect how we are able to fill perks. We will try our best to make sure that doesn’t happen, but we can’t control the roads or the weather. We value openness and honesty, so if something like this happens our backers will be the first to know
That said we are both incredibly determined (some might even say stubborn), and resourceful. We know how to problem solve and we’re good at coming up with solutions.  If stuff happens on the road we’ll roll with it and keep right on trucking (or vanning, in this case). We take our responsibility to our backers incredibly seriously and we want to make sure you feel good about supporting our cross-country escapades.
Other more run of the mill challenges include unforseen production delays in terms of getting merchandise for perks made, delays in perk fulfillment, and shipping issues.  Unfortunately once your perk is in the hands of the U.S. Postal system we have very little control over whether it gets to you and the condition in which it arrives.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
None of our perks tickled your fancy?  Just don’t have the spare pocket change to join the road trip? We know that you might not be able to contribute financially and that’s ok!  Even if you don’t pledge there are lots of things you can do to help us out.

One show, focused on the largest NCAA division and sport, on air for 16 years in some form or fashion out of a basement studio (office).</p><p><i>Hoopsville</i> was a brainchild of Dave McHugh’s back in 2000. Since then it has been on the air for 14 seasons and become a must-watch event for basketball fans, coaches, players, and others.</p><div></div><p>The show is no longer a hobby, but a major part of McHugh’s life. It has grown from a once-a-week two-hour show to a twice-a-week program from November until March. It features a 12-hour marathon show, an NCAA tournament selections special, a bracket-breakdown event, and live pre-game and post-game, court-side, coverage from the men’s basketball championships each year, and plenty more.</p><p>The challenge: it costs a lot to keep the show going especially at the higher and higher standards it has created. The show has incredible support from the likes of the National Association of Basketball Coaches, the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association, and D3hoops.com, but there are still expenses like travel, equipment upgrades, and more that can be overwhelming.</p><p>For several years, we turned to those who love the show to help the show and they have done so each and every year. It is humbling to know that <i>Hoopsvillea</i> is important to so many that donating to keep it going or help it improve is important to others. It is also humbling to hear those who have donated ask if they can do so again and again. People want to give back as a way of saying thank you.</p><p>What does it mean to donate to <i>Hoopsville</i>? Consider it like donating to public television. We spend the money on making the sure the show remains on the air and improving where we can. Pay the bills, upgrade equipment, take a trip to cover Division III basketball more in person. Understand we want the spotlight to be brighter on the programs, coaches, and especially the student-athletes who dedicate themselves to the sport and the division. Your donation goes a long way in doing all of that.</p><p>So we are asking for your help. We want to cover Division III basketball the way we feel it deserves to be covered. These student-athletes give it all not only on the basketball court, but also in the classroom and in their communities. They deserve to have a spotlight on them and we are the ones shining the light. Helping us now, even a small amount, can have a large impact.</p><h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3><p>We decided to raise the bar this year. We want to raise $10,000 knowing that about 10-percent will be lost in fees. We want to try and raise more so we can do more.</p><p>There are upgrades needed in our studios including to maintain our production computer. Some gear has also shown signs of age and needs to be replaced – a common, yearly problem.</p><p>There is also the hope to travel. Being able to get out of the studio and see games on campus or being in gyms around the country gives us a better chance to not only appreciate great basketball around the country, but bring the spotlight to more student-athletes. And when we travel, we bring the show with us as we did earlier this season to Roanoke College and the Old Dominion Athletic Conference.</p><p>As the show grows, as do expectations which means we need more staff to help run <i>Hoopsville</i>. Raising money along with hopefully finding sponsors and advertisers will allow us to expand the production team from one person – Dave McHugh – to others.</p><p>In the past, expenses were paid for out of our own pockets or thanks to modest contributions from the WBCA and NABC. However, we want to do more – it just costs more.</p><p>Contribute to the Hoopsville Fundraiser and we will find ways to thank you:</p><ul>
<li>Contribute at least $10 and we will recognize you on our special contributors' page on our website (<a href=""http://www.d3hoopsville.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.d3hoopsville.com</a>).</li>
<li>Contribute at least $30 and we will recognize you on our contributors' page and publicly thank you on a future <i>Hoopsville</i> show.</li>
<li>The first 20 to contribute at least $75 and we will recognize you on our contributors' page, publicly thank you on a future show, and send you a <i>Hoopsville</i> t-shirt.</li>
<li>The first 10 to contribute at least $150 and will get all of the above plus Dave will wear your school's shirt on the show while also interviewing the men's or women's coach of your choosing (if we can't accommodate that option by the end of this season, we will make sure to have the guest on early next season).</li>
<li>The first five to contribute at least $250 and will get all of the above PLUS give you the chance to appear on <i>Hoopsville</i> to talk about your team and why you love Division III basketball (if you so choose).</li>
</ul><p>No matter what amount we raise, we will use it wisely to improve what we can because ultimately even a small drop in the bucket can have a ripple effect.</p><h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3><p>Many have asked us to continue providing them a chance to give back to us and our programming. We compare it a little to public television and public radio. We have tried to be humble in our efforts, but in the last few years we have grown to appreciate how much people enjoy our efforts and want to give back.</p><p>Every dollar counts. The costs add up quickly. From the basic bills for power, internet, telephone line, and the like. To equipment like computer upgrades and software. Even other gear like cameras, lighting, microphones, and more. It all adds up. Over the years, we have collected gear and done our best to maintain it, but all equipment eventually fails and needs to be replaced.</p><p>We have also grown to appreciate that going to games in different parts of the country is a thrill not only to see teams we normally don't see, but to watch student-athletes do more than just play basketball. Of course, airfare or gas, hotels, rental vehicles, etc. all adds up as well. We want to travel more, but don't honestly have the ability to head out the door whenever we want and travel wherever we want.</p><p>To give you an idea of how our costs, here are some items we have paid for over the last few years:</p><p>- Production Software (Wirecast): $500-1,000 for software upgrades.<br/>- HD Video Camera: $1,500 (slightly used) - future costs will probably be around $2,000.<br/>- Wireless microphones system for camera: $500<br/>- Audio board: $250 - will need to replace these soon.<br/>- Microphones and cables in studio: $1,000 - many of these are several years old and need to be replaced.<br/>- Lighting (studio and mobile): $800<br/>- Video editing software: $550 a year<br/><br/>There are other expenses as well we have already had to spend on this season, are ready to purchase now, or are on the wish list. They include headset amplifiers, cables, new video cameras, and more. None of what we show here covers hotels, airplanes, cars, etc., when we are on the road seeing games and gathering interviews for the show.</p><p>We know there are some who still want to contribute to the show and any help we receive will make a huge impact on what we are able to do in the future. Remember this is essentially a hobby and expenses to run the show come out of our. We do these fundraisers because people do care about our programming and we constantly struggle to find advertisers willing to invest in what they consider a small fish.</p><p>This show has proven to be more than something we enjoy doing: is has become the center of conversation in Division III basketball and even for the entire division. The show has an impact on the sport and the division and we want to continue having a voice especially for the student-athletes.</p><h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3><p>We certainly understand if you cannot make a financial contribution, however you can still contribute. Spread the word about our campaign, so that others may be able to contribute to the cause. Tell people about <i>Hoopsville</i>. The more who watch, the bigger the spotlight on Division III basketball becomes. You can even donate goods or services you think could impact the show.

Over the years, we have collected gear and done our best to maintain it, but all equipment eventually fails and needs to be replaced.We have also grown to appreciate that going to games in different parts of the country is a thrill not only to see teams we normally don't see, but to watch student-athletes do more than just play basketball. Of course, airfare or gas, hotels, rental vehicles, etc. all adds up as well. We want to travel more, but don't honestly have the ability to head out the door whenever we want and travel wherever we want.To give you an idea of how our costs, here are some items we have paid for over the last few years:- Production Software (Wirecast): $500-1,000 for software upgrades.- HD Video Camera: $1,500 (slightly used) - future costs will probably be around $2,000.- Wireless microphones system for camera: $500- Audio board: $250 - will need to replace these soon.- Microphones and cables in studio: $1,000 - many of these are several years old and need to be replaced.- Lighting (studio and mobile): $800- Video editing software: $550 a yearThere are other expenses as well we have already had to spend on this season, are ready to purchase now, or are on the wish list. They include headset amplifiers, cables, new video cameras, and more. None of what we show here covers hotels, airplanes, cars, etc., when we are on the road seeing games and gathering interviews for the show.We know there are some who still want to contribute to the show and any help we receive will make a huge impact on what we are able to do in the future. Remember this is essentially a hobby and expenses to run the show come out of our. We do these fundraisers because people do care about our programming and we constantly struggle to find advertisers willing to invest in what they consider a small fish.This show has proven to be more than something we enjoy doing: is has become the center of conversation in Division III basketball and even for the entire division. The show has an impact on the sport and the division and we want to continue having a voice especially for the student-athletes.Other Ways You Can HelpWe certainly understand if you cannot make a financial contribution, however you can still contribute. Spread the word about our campaign, so that others may be able to contribute to the cause. Tell people about Hoopsville. The more who watch, the bigger the spotlight on Division III basketball becomes. You can even donate goods or services you think could impact the show. Maybe you know a sponsor or advertiser who would like to be part of the program. Let them know about us; let us know about them.You can share this campaign via our blog on D3hoops.com or via the Indiegogo share tools. And you can easily contact us as well (hoopsville@d3hoops.com).Also follow us on Twitter (@d3hoopsville and #Hoopsville), Facebook (www.facebook.com/Hoopsville), and Instagram (@d3hoopsville and #Hoopsville).",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Sound Pollination was created by 4 guys that decided they really enjoy talking and figured “why not try to do that for a living?” </p>
<p>In all sincerity, this project came to fruition out of a desire to invent an outlet where young creatives can have the freedom to express their ideas. This encompasses music, podcasts, and anything else our little minds can conjure up. </p>
<p>A little about the founders: Mickey Roberts is an actor/filmmaker with a passion for absorbing as much knowledge as he possibly can. Keith Vartanian is an actor with a passion for Fortnite and martial arts. Gianni Damaia is an actor/writer who is talking in third person right now and has a borderline unhealthy obsession with movies and games. And Grant Crawford does too many things to be able to put in such a small blurb. The point of telling you all of this is to express that we are as passionate and self obsessed as the people you likely listen to on a regular basis, so why not come listen to us? </p>
<p>As of pre launch we currently have a backlog of 3 podcasts. Knowing Nothing is Mickey’s way of translating his love of searching for knowledge into an easily digestible, well researched lifestyle/educational show where he gives his audience facts about just about anything under the sun. Bad Movies Podcast is where Gianni occasionally punishes himself by watching as many bad movies as he can in order to evaluate if they are truly as bad as critics seem to believe with a fresh new guest each episode. And Twenty Something’s is a long form podcast where Grant and Keith bring in a multitude of young creatives and break down how they have found success and/or happiness. </p>
<p>We want this to be a platform for creatives by creatives, and we think we can deliver quality entertainment and thought provoking content in line with that.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Currently we’re trying to raise a minimum of $2,500 in order to build ourselves to become a full fledged audio/visual production company. What does that mean exactly? Well I’ll tell you. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>CONTENT</strong>: Remember how above ^ I mentioned the podcasts we have on backlog? Well they’re all great but we want more of them. That’s right. We want MORE content. We aspire to bring to our audience everything they could possibly want, whether it be movies, lifestyle, education, sports, music, FREAKING COOKING. We want to bring it all to you, because the odds are we’re going to connect with at least one of your passions. But in order to afford the equipment and time we need to keep producing the quality content we want, we need to meet our goal. </li>
<li>
<strong>EXPANSION</strong>: Notice how I mentioned a “visual” component to this company? As of yet, we don’t have one. Why? Our day jobs can’t provide it. But we want it. Ideally, we want to be able to livestream our content, and be able to upload the audio/visual streams directly to YouTube so everyone can see it. We believe this form of expansion is the future of this company and can give everyone a multitude of ways to absorb our content. We want to seep into your eyeballs as well as your ear holes...sorry...was that too much? We’re also trying to get some merchandise up and running so that everyone can spread their sound with a cool t-shirt or a magnet. We have quite a few designs in the works and are excited to share them!</li>
<li>
<strong>CONSISTENCY</strong>: So, I may be biased, but I truly believe that our current content is exemplary in terms of quality and definitely on par with whatever you might be listening to right now. If nothing else, this money will help us establish a cushion to be able to keep that quality consistent, and even slightly better. For example, we got a squeaky chair right now, that we’d love to get rid of so you don’t hear the awkward squeak in the middle of a passionate rant about why Jersey Girl is actually a great movie (don’t roll your eyes, it is). </li>
</ul>
<p>Your contribution, in even the smallest form, would make the world of difference to us, and could make this company truly come to life. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Let’s talk about representation and being heard as individuals! As Asian Americans who grew up in the Bay Area, we saw a gap in the way our stories are packaged and shared with the rest of the world. In a society where “Crazy Rich Asians,” a wonderful film that we love, is deemed a pivotal moment that brought the Asian experience to the rest of the world, we can’t help but feel like there’s still much more to be done and many more stories to tell. We have to keep the momentum going. To be Asian is so many things and it can look so many different ways. Our community cannot be painted with one broad stroke. Since modern society moves slowly to address gaps in representation, we decided to create and tell the stories we’ve been missing. We want to foster deeper connections with the people around us. We’re committed to changing our narrative - one story at a time. Our visual storytelling platform aims to highlight the different perspectives, cultures and individual experiences that go beyond a label of our identities. We invite you to join the conversation.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The founders of More Than Asian are running this important project pro bono. Donated funds will go towards photo shoot set costs, paid awareness campaigns, project management software, gas tolls and parking, and creative support.</p>
<p>With your help, we can grow and sustain an accessible blog and Instagram profile that fosters more diverse storytelling within the Asian American community. We are committed to creating a space of transparency, empowerment and community that brings to light a more inclusive narrative for Asian Americans. </p>
<h3>What We've Done So Far</h3>
<p>Developed the brand, messaging and creative direction of our project, including designing distinct logo marks and brand elements.</p>
<p>Brought on a talented creative team of photographers, copy editors, and graphic designers who help bring our stories and brand to life visually.</p>
<p>Launched our project in April of this year at morethanasian.com and @morethanasian on Instagram.</p>
<p>Published nine stories from a diverse group of Asian Americans, some on our blog as editorial interviews and others as video interviews on IGTV including a Black Perspectives in the Asian Community series. Our Season One stories are almost complete and we will begin planning and outreach for Season Two. </p>
<p>Established partnerships with Bay Area Asian American organizations that highlight stories and important social issues within the community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our Reason For Being:</p>
<p>More Than Asian is a conversation starter focused on Asian American identities and experiences, drawing connections within communities and individual spaces. We visually stimulate and empower our audience through positive, open and diverse storytelling.</p>
<p>Since the official launch of our project in April, we have interviewed Asian Americans from different cultures and backgrounds who have felt empowered by the experience of being able to share their stories. These have undeniably been a difficult, eye-opening last few months for our world. Between those who have fallen ill to the coronavirus and the unprecedented backlash of the pandemic to the Asian American community, as well as the significant social uprising of the Black Lives Matter movement in response to the murder of George Floyd, it is now more important than ever to bring forward positive, personal and authentic stories from Asian Americans to help change the narrative, one story at a time.</p>

<strong>Version of Maonocaster on Indiegogo Indemand does NOT support USB connection to macOS devices</strong>, but the USB connection does work perfectly when connected to Windows PC and MacBook running Windows via Boot Camp. However, you can bypass this problem by using the 3.5mm TRRS jack on Maonocaster instead to connect to your macOS devices.  It could take some time before the upgraded Maonocaster whose USB supports both macOS and Windows can come out. </li>
<li>
<strong>The app along with Maonocaster is only available for Windows</strong>, so it can’t be installed on a Mac. If you’re Mac user, please note that the app is Windows only. </li>
<li> <strong>Maonocaster currently doesn’t support multi-track digital recording</strong>. It can only mix two MIC input signals, and two input signals of AUX or phone, and then import them to phone or PC via a AUX cable and USB-C connection. For specific types of output signals, please check out the signal route chart on the campaign page.</li>
<li>
<strong> It’s not recommended to connect your Game Console to the MAONOCASTER</strong>, because we haven’t carried out compatibility test between Maonocaster and Game Console. There are only XLR, 1/4"", 3.5mm audio input ports, and 3.5mm AUX and USB-C output ports.</li>
<li> <strong>The output signals from USB-C on MAONOCASTER are not stereo</strong>. The way how MAONOCASTER is designed is as followed: Input and Output hardware design are all in Stereo, but due to the need of the signal processing, we mix them all into mono signal, so the user will hear dual channel signal but from the same source. For specific types of output signals, please check out the signal route chart on the campaign page.</li>
<li> <strong>Maonocaster is not compatible with USB microphone</strong>, but it can work with XLR, 1/4'' and 3.5mm TRS microphones. There is a reward tier including XLR microphone available. For the details of the included microphone, please check it out from <a href=""https://www.maono.com/products/xlr-condenser-microphone-maono-pm320/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here: https://www.maono.com/products/xlr-condenser-microphone-maono-pm320/ </a>

<strong> Currently not all eight jingles are programmable</strong>. There are 4 preset and one cough button that can’t be programmed. The four preset buttons are: BADUM TSSSS, CHEERING, CLAPPING and SUSPENSE.</li>
<li> <strong>Users can’t modify the default sound effects including compressor, de-esser, high-pass filter, noise gate and ducking</strong>. MAONOCASTER is mainly for sound mixing and live streaming, which is an ideal option for both beginners and pro-sumers. We will also add some new function to the next version for pro to use.</li>
<li> <strong>There’s no SD card slot on Maonocaster, so recordings can’t be saved on SD card</strong>. But you can connect Maonocaster to your phone via POD1 or POD2, or to your PC via USB-C, so recordings can be saved on your phone or computer directly.</li>
<li> <strong>Maonocaster doesn’t support MIX-MINUS</strong>, so the interviewee can only hear the sound of the anchor.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>Maonocaster is designed with the intention to simplify the way to start podcasting anywhere and anytime for those who are into streaming and podcasting. Technically speaking, the functions mentioned above that can’t be achieved are still possible to be realize, but it will take much more time.

<p>Tara Ariano, Sarah D. Bunting, and David T. Cole were the founders of Television Without Pity. At our new site, Previously.TV, we want to bring back the big recaps that got you hooked on some of your favourite shows of the '00s and '10s, but we, like many other sites you've recently loved and lost, know that ad revenue alone isn't going to get us there. Help us make it 2002 again.</p>

<h3>To Be Specific...</h3>
<p>To start us on this new (old) path, we're seeking funds to supplement our editorial budget. The shows we have in mind right now to get the giant recaps started? </p>

<li>American Crime Story: The Assassination Of Gianni Versace</li>
<li>The Americans</li>

<li>Call The Midwife</li>
<li>Claws</li>
<li>The Crown</li>

<li>Westworld</li>
</ul>
<p>Your contribution goes 100% to the paying the recappers for their hard work (except Tara and Sarah; they have to work for free). Contributing can get you the chance to help us seed a hidden phrase through the recaps for readers to find, enjoy an ad-free experience on the Previously.TV forums, or dedicate a recap to a friend, cause, character or important inanimate object.</p>
<p>And by the way: eight shows is only the starting point. Depending on what you tell us and how deep your pockets are, there could be more.</p>

<p>For each $7000 we raise above our initial ask, we can recap the coming season of an additional show. (Maybe you've noticed, but there are a lot of TV shows right now.)</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Brian Thompson, and I am an investigative journalist. For over 130 episodes, I have chronicled my investigation into why McDonald's stopped serving pizza in the early to mid-1990s on my investigative journalism program Whatever Happened to Pizza at McDonald's?. In the course of this quest, I have traveled to far-flung places such as Washington, D.C.; Paris, France; and the dilapidated hamlet of Pomeroy, Ohio. Now, I would like to journey to Adak, Alaska--at the tip of the Aleutian Islands--to excavate what could be the most important evidence of McDonald's Pizza known to exist.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571093535/pm0mzzpqyjefyvck6kuc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Adak is home to an ancient and abandoned McDonald's location that I believe has been preserved to an unprecedented degree by the very low degrees of the Alaskan climate. It is probable that some key piece of the McDonald's Pizza puzzle still exists on or around the premises, whether in the form of a menu featuring pizza, pizza ovens still extant within the structure itself, and/or remains of McDonald's Pizza in the fossilized droppings of local fishermen/caribou.</p>
<p>Here is a video of said abandoned McDonald's recorded roughly a decade ago by an urban explorer who is clearly less qualified than me:</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mw_u7A_eFxY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>I will scour the area, I will interview the locals, and I will even provide a public service by staging a live recording of Whatever Happened to Pizza at McDonald's? as a free service for the residents of the island. If any clues as to the true reason why McDonald's stopped serving pizza exist on this remote island, I will find them or die trying.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571093562/edwcuvkhs1horocap6qu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Necessities</h3>
<p>The bulk of the financial resources required to journey to Adak, Alaska, will be spent on airfare and lodging. The island is only accessible twice a week, when Alaska Airlines flies from the nearby metropolis of Anchorage. As I live in Los Angeles, I will have to fly from LA to Anchorage, spend the night there mentally and physically preparing myself for the remaining journey, then fly to Adak the following day. This will be on a Wednesday. The next return flight does not depart until the following Saturday. In the meantime, I will need to arrange for accommodations while I conduct my research.</p>
<p>It is a perilous journey fraught with risks, and I have detailed the budget thusly:<br/>Round-trip airfare from Los Angeles to Anchorage: $358<br/>Round-trip airfare from Anchorage to Adak Island: $891 (an astonishing price, I am aware)<br/>One night of hotel accommodations in Anchorage: $72<br/>Three nights of Air Bed and Breakfast lodging on Adak Island: $423<br/>Food/transportation/fees/scarf costs: $256</p>
<p>Total: $2,000<br/><br/>These are approximate figures, but the budget seems sound. If I do not meet the $2,000 funding goal, no backers will be charged and the journey to Alaska will be just another grand idea lost to history. If I exceed the funding goal, any excess funds will be donated to a charity to be voted upon by you the listeners at a later date.</p>
<p>I should also note that I am seeking corporate sponsorship for this expedition, and if the budget is met via those means, this fundraising campaign will be canceled and no one will be charged.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Rewards</h3>
<p>I believe that offering rewards of ascending value to those with the most financial means is a form of class warfare. Thus, all backers of this expedition will receive the same package of rewards, which include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exclusive access to the live recording of Whatever Happened to Pizza at McDonald's? provided as a free public service to the residents of Adak Island.</li>
<li>A personal video ""thank you"" message delivered to the recipient of your choice via electronic mail.</li>
<li>A personalized ""Deputy Investigative Journalist"" card signed by me and suitable for printing and laminating.</li>
<li>Entry into a drawing for a free t-shirt from <a href=""https://teespring.com/stores/pizzaatmcds"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our Teespring store</a>.</li>
<li>Entry into a drawing for a piece of framed original art from my ""web comic"" series It Would Be Nice If This Were The Way It Was (a $1,000,000 value).</li>
<li>Entry into a drawing to win a FREE copy of our upcoming board game Pizzaquest (publishing in Spring of 2020).</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that even if the total you wish to donate does not include a perk upon checkout, you will receive the same perks as all donors. However, I have set up perk tiers to reflect common donation amounts.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are no risks to you the backers. I have proven my ability to ""make good"" on crowdfunded expeditions, as my journey to Pomeroy, Ohio, to try original recipe McDonald's Pizza in the year 2017 was a massive success <a href=""https://www.spreaker.com/user/pizzaatmcds/episode-31"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">chronicled on my program Whatever Happened to Pizza at McDonald's?</a>. I will have no trouble meeting the same standard on this occasion, and I will endeavor to produce both audio and video reports of the highest journalistic quality.</p>
<p>However, there are many risks and challenges for myself, as it is within the realm of possibility that I will be forever stranded on Adak Island and forced to join whatever ""cargo cult"" currently dominates the area's social scene.</p>

The shows creator and host is veteran film pro, fight director and filmmaker Carter Ferguson (me).  </p><p>I launched this podcast as I've had my ups and downs in life - personally, creatively and professionally - and I wanted to give a little back to those who may find themselves in similar situations. As a productivity junky and someone who has learned the hard way by falling into just about every trap and scam there is out there, I felt a responsibility to help others in the creative industries to avoid the pitfalls, and live a happier and more effective life by embracing the techniques of productivity which I wish I'd known myself. Although aimed at film pros and other creatives, <i>I try to make the show accessible to all listeners</i>. </p><p>As well as creating and hosting every show, I also created the logos, built the website, man the social networking accounts, and financed the first year of the show without assistance... so I'm no slouch. All of the equipment that I work on was either bought second hand or in the case of my software is free to use.</p><p>It's my hope that if you've made it to this page you are already aware of my work but if not then please have a <strong>listen to this sample clip</strong> to get a feel for what the show is all about.</p><div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/GU_uD-RDWlk?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div style=""text-align: center;""> </div><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>“No one has ever become poor from giving.” – Anne Frank</strong></h3><p>Due to the network cancellation of two of the television shows on which I was employed, I have limited funds to take the show into its second year. In addition, my media hosting costs have trebled since I launched, which is frustrating. </p><p>At the time of writing, I have that ever-present freelancer problem of not actually having been paid yet for several jobs and taking 6 weeks out January and February to create Season 2 was, in hindsight, maybe a bad idea. As I start to write and record season 3 I can expect to lose pretty much all of my free time over the next 6 weeks in putting it together too.

The shows creator and host is veteran film pro, fight director and filmmaker Carter Ferguson (me).  I launched this podcast as I've had my ups and downs in life - personally, creatively and professionally - and I wanted to give a little back to those who may find themselves in similar situations. As a productivity junky and someone who has learned the hard way by falling into just about every trap and scam there is out there, I felt a responsibility to help others in the creative industries to avoid the pitfalls, and live a happier and more effective life by embracing the techniques of productivity which I wish I'd known myself. Although aimed at film pros and other creatives, I try to make the show accessible to all listeners. As well as creating and hosting every show, I also created the logos, built the website, man the social networking accounts, and financed the first year of the show without assistance... so I'm no slouch. All of the equipment that I work on was either bought second hand or in the case of my software is free to use.It's my hope that if you've made it to this page you are already aware of my work but if not then please have a listen to this sample clip to get a feel for what the show is all about. “No one has ever become poor from giving.” – Anne FrankDue to the network cancellation of two of the television shows on which I was employed, I have limited funds to take the show into its second year. In addition, my media hosting costs have trebled since I launched, which is frustrating. At the time of writing, I have that ever-present freelancer problem of not actually having been paid yet for several jobs and taking 6 weeks out January and February to create Season 2 was, in hindsight, maybe a bad idea. As I start to write and record season 3 I can expect to lose pretty much all of my free time over the next 6 weeks in putting it together too. A crowdfunding campaign seemed to be a logical and practical solution to my problem, and an opportunity to raise the profile of the show in a slightly different way.  How You Can Help“Nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could do only a little.”  Edmund BurkeAny little money you can put towards this campaign would be greatly appreciated, but equally, just spreading the word about this campaign would also be extremely helpful.The CostsThe minimum I can run an Indiegogo campaign for is £500.The breakdown of the budget for year 2 is as follows.£90 - MEDIA HOSTING (1 yr) at Podbean.  At the moment I pay $36- a year however this option has been REMOVED BY PODBEAN and is no longer available.  I'm getting forced to upgrade to the $108- UNLIMITED package as the lower-cost one has been removed. With that said, however, I will gain several advantages with the new package which will actually help the show.
The show will finally appear on SPOTIFY. On my current package, this possibility is blocked by Podbean.
Secondly, with my current package, I get almost no analytical data. With the Unlimited package, I will get detailed analytics which will be immensely useful for promotion and for the understanding of my audience.
Lastly, on my current deal, I can only upload 100mb a month, which is a maximum of about 4 or 5 episodes. The Unlimited package will allow me to upload new content without having to delete old content to make space, which I regularly have to do when uploading new versions and make releasing seasons of work at a time significantly easier.
£112- 1 Year of Website HostingThis pays for 1 full year of website hosting for the official website. From here the show is publicized. It is effectively the shop-front of the show and is one which I can guarantee will NOT BE EDITED BY A THIRD PARTY.£64- Domain name ""filmproproductivity.com"" (2yrs) with Security (inclusive of taxes).This will secure the shows domain name is retained for 2 further years. The additional payment for Security will ensure the website is safe from hackers.£25- Campaign CostsIndiegogo will take a 5% cut of the money that comes in. In addition, some payments by card are charged a fee which comes out of the total. This £25 ensures that the money committed will serve it's intended purpose.So the amount I am seeking to keep things going is £285HOWEVER...the minimum amount I can aim for here is £500 
The remaining £215 will be used to promote the show.

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>Welcome Bricking Around fan. As you know Bricking Around is one of Australia's premier LEGO® Fan Sites. Operating a site such as this requires a lot of time, effort and money. It's that last part that I am hoping you are able to help me with. I would like Bricking Around to be the best possible site that it can be. My goals for 2017 are to have more reviews (including video reviews and innovative new review concepts) as well as offer more giveaways.</p>
<p>This campaign has flexible funding, so rewards are not dependant on reaching the goal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Is The Funding For?</h3>
<p>There are two main things that I need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical equipment to produce great review content, including innovative ideas not previously seen.</li>
<li>LEGO products to actually review.</li>
<li>More products for competitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously the idea of paying for somebody else to buy LEGO seems a bit strange, but your support will mean better coverage and more competitions.</p>
<h3>Perks:</h3>
<p>This campaign was originally launched as a bit of April Fools fun, so the initial rewards were a bit of a joke. All amounts include postage within Australia.</p>
<p>For $25 I will send you an exclusive random minifigure. This minifigure will feature a random head, torso, legs and hat/hair. Will you get a female minifigure wearing a hard hat? Only one way to find out.</p>

<h3>About the Project </h3>
<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
<p>Hello! We are Sarah and Shana, two storytellers and theatremakers from Boston, Massachusetts. In the times of the pandemic we found ourselves turning towards romance fiction as a balm for weary hearts. So! We decided to write our own romance, taking the feel-good genre, adding a little bit of magic, and centering a queer woman of color as the heroine of our story. Shana will also be starring in it!</p>
<p><strong>What is the story? </strong></p>
<p>Chantal, a shy soul with magical affinities, is in an emotional slump when a magically possessed book arrives on her doorstep the same week a former crush, Skye, moves into the apartment upstairs. Calling on her quirky, magically trained college friend Morgan for help, Chantal attempts to unravel the mystery of the book, which reconnects her to her magical abilities but draws her further in than she intended, forcing her to reckon with the unresolved romance from her past. </p>
<p><strong>Why a fiction podcast? </strong></p>
<p>Podcasts are one of the more accessible venues of storytelling, allowing for safe remote access that is not hidden behind a paywall. Sarah previously co-wrote for the audiodrama <i>Still Lives </i>and wanted to delve back into the medium. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>One of the main goals of this project is to provide paid work to actors, particularly queer actors and actors of color, who have reduced acting opportunities due to the pandemic. A majority of money raised will therefore go directly to paying voice actors for their work. Additional funds will go towards paying fees for a website and podcast hosting platform, and paying for editing consultation and support (as newbie audio editor, Sarah would love to be able to pay someone to help her out!). </p>
<p><b>Where the money goes </b></p>
<p>​As a starting point, we are aiming to pay actors a minimum of $50 per full episode, though we would love the opportunity to increase our pay if funds allow! Specifically this would mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>Episode 1: Pay two voice actors ($100)</li>
<li>Episode 2: Pay two voice actors ($100)</li>
<li>Episode 3: Pay three voice actors ($150)</li>
<li>Episode 4: Pay two voice actors ($100)</li>
<li>Episode 5: Pay four voice actors ($200)</li>
<li>Episode 6: Pay two voice actors ($100)</li>
<li>Episode 7: Pay four voice actors ($200)</li>
<li>Episode 8: Pay four voice actors ($200)</li>
<li>
<strong>Total: </strong>This brings our primary goal for voice actor pay to <strong>$1,150 </strong>for the whole series. </li>
</ul>
<p>Additional funds would help cover the cost of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Website &amp; podcast hosting platform: $18/month<ul><li>That would be $108 for 6 months or $216/year</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Editing and sound consultation: $45/episode</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p>In addition to ultimately beaming a magical love story directly into your headphones at the end of this project, we would like to show our gratitude by offering perks for your generous contribution!</p>
<ul>
<li>$5 - Anyone who donates $5 or more will be personally thanked in an episode of our podcast</li>
<li>$15 - Anyone who donates $15 or more will receive a handwritten thank you postcard (which also supports the USPS - yay!)*</li>
<li>$30 - Anyone who donates $30 or more will receive access to a Behind-The-Scenes google drive that includes bloopers reels, behind-the-scenes photos and annotated scripts. *</li>
<li>$50 - Anyone who donates $50 or more will receive a one of a kind, <i>Affinities</i> themed painting from Sarah (this also supports the USPS - huzzah!)*</li>
</ul>
<p>*Perks are cumulative, so you receive all lower level perks in addition to the highest perk at your donation level. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Donate to this Project?</h3>
<p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
<p>Romance is one of the most popular genres of fiction in the United States, yet heroines of color, and particularly queer heroines of color, are generally underrepresented in these stories. We want to recenter this beloved genre around a queer Black protagonist and celebrate her love and magical power through our story. We would love your help in bringing this story to life!</p>
<p><b>Paying Actors </b></p>
<p>We value paying actors appropriately for their talent and their work, which was true long before the pandemic. Since the pandemic, the performing arts world has taken a major financial hit across the board, which has left many actors out of work. Contributing to our fund will allow us to appropriately compensate these talented actors, whose work we often turn to for joy and comfort when times are difficult. </p>
<p><strong>Website and Accessibility </strong></p>
<p>Creating a website for the podcast will not only give us a platform where we can submit our podcast to Apple Podcast, Stitcher, and other free and accessible podcast listening services, but it will help us reach greater audiences and enable us to share transcripts of episodes in order to be accessible to all audiences.

</div></div>","About the Project 
Who are we?
Hello! We are Sarah and Shana, two storytellers and theatremakers from Boston, Massachusetts. In the times of the pandemic we found ourselves turning towards romance fiction as a balm for weary hearts. So! We decided to write our own romance, taking the feel-good genre, adding a little bit of magic, and centering a queer woman of color as the heroine of our story. Shana will also be starring in it!
What is the story? 
Chantal, a shy soul with magical affinities, is in an emotional slump when a magically possessed book arrives on her doorstep the same week a former crush, Skye, moves into the apartment upstairs. Calling on her quirky, magically trained college friend Morgan for help, Chantal attempts to unravel the mystery of the book, which reconnects her to her magical abilities but draws her further in than she intended, forcing her to reckon with the unresolved romance from her past. 
Why a fiction podcast? 
Podcasts are one of the more accessible venues of storytelling, allowing for safe remote access that is not hidden behind a paywall. Sarah previously co-wrote for the audiodrama Still Lives and wanted to delve back into the medium. 

What We Need & What You Get
One of the main goals of this project is to provide paid work to actors, particularly queer actors and actors of color, who have reduced acting opportunities due to the pandemic. A majority of money raised will therefore go directly to paying voice actors for their work. Additional funds will go towards paying fees for a website and podcast hosting platform, and paying for editing consultation and support (as newbie audio editor, Sarah would love to be able to pay someone to help her out!). 
Where the money goes 
​As a starting point, we are aiming to pay actors a minimum of $50 per full episode, though we would love the opportunity to increase our pay if funds allow! Specifically this would mean:

Episode 1: Pay two voice actors ($100)
Episode 2: Pay two voice actors ($100)
Episode 3: Pay three voice actors ($150)
Episode 4: Pay two voice actors ($100)
Episode 5: Pay four voice actors ($200)
Episode 6: Pay two voice actors ($100)
Episode 7: Pay four voice actors ($200)
Episode 8: Pay four voice actors ($200)

Total: This brings our primary goal for voice actor pay to $1,150 for the whole series. 

Additional funds would help cover the cost of:

Website & podcast hosting platform: $18/monthThat would be $108 for 6 months or $216/year

Editing and sound consultation: $45/episode

 
What You Get
In addition to ultimately beaming a magical love story directly into your headphones at the end of this project, we would like to show our gratitude by offering perks for your generous contribution!

$5 - Anyone who donates $5 or more will be personally thanked in an episode of our podcast
$15 - Anyone who donates $15 or more will receive a handwritten thank you postcard (which also supports the USPS - yay!)*
$30 - Anyone who donates $30 or more will receive access to a Behind-The-Scenes google drive that includes bloopers reels, behind-the-scenes photos and annotated scripts. *
$50 - Anyone who donates $50 or more will receive a one of a kind, Affinities themed painting from Sarah (this also supports the USPS - huzzah!)*

*Perks are cumulative, so you receive all lower level perks in addition to the highest perk at your donation level. 

Why Donate to this Project?
The Story
Romance is one of the most popular genres of fiction in the United States, yet heroines of color, and particularly queer heroines of color, are generally underrepresented in these stories. We want to recenter this beloved genre around a queer Black protagonist and celebrate her love and magical power through our story. We would love your help in bringing this story to life!
Paying Actors 
We value paying actors appropriately for their talent and their work, which was true long before the pandemic. Since the pandemic, the performing arts world has taken a major financial hit across the board, which has left many actors out of work. Contributing to our fund will allow us to appropriately compensate these talented actors, whose work we often turn to for joy and comfort when times are difficult. 
Website and Accessibility 
Creating a website for the podcast will not only give us a platform where we can submit our podcast to Apple Podcast, Stitcher, and other free and accessible podcast listening services, but it will help us reach greater audiences and enable us to share transcripts of episodes in order to be accessible to all audiences. Sarah's previous project Still Lives used a website as a way to gain media attention and the show has now received over 50,000 downloads as a result. Your donation helps cover the cost of this necessary service.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>IT</strong> Ideato da Ariam Tekle e Emmanuelle Maréchal, #Blackcoffee è il podcast italiano senza filtri che racconta le identità nere. Il podcast propone interviste ad ospiti afrodiscendenti, che attraverso il loro lavoro ed iniziative, contribuiscono ad ampliare lo sguardo sul panorama delle identità nere. L’intenzione, infatti, è di creare uno spazio di conversazione e confronto su tematiche complesse e poco raccontate dai media o approcciate in maniera superficiale.</p>
<p>Qui tutti gli episodi della prima e della seconda stagione (link Spotify) <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/6755QN6OWd5ggR7AzMML7E?si=Lyisy02FTq2v7Hq0JEoZYQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://open.spotify.com/show/6755QN6OWd5ggR7Az...</a></p>

<p><strong>Le co-host</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emmanuelle Maréchal</strong>, classe 87, è francese di origine camerunense. La sua esperienza italiana inizia nel 2009 a Bologna, grazie al programma di scambio internazionale Erasmus. Emmanuelle decide di continuare il suo percorso bolognese dove si laurea in Relazioni Internazionali nel 2014. Durante i suoi cinque anni in Italia, lei rimane stupita dal paesaggio bianco italiano, notando soprattutto quanto parlare di razza e di razzismo fosse un tabù e quanto gli italiani stessi non conoscessero la propria storia. Appassionata di storia e della diaspora africana in Europa, ha creato un profilo Instagram chiamato The LBDStories per raccontare la storia della sua famiglia e quella della diaspora africana in Europa. E’ proprio durante la preparazione di un podcast (in inglese) in cui cercava contributi di italiani neri che incontra Ariam.</p>
<p><strong>Ariam Tekle</strong> è una documentarista Eritrea-Italiana nata e cresciuta a Milano. Figlia di immigrati eritrei, Ariam ha sviluppato un interesse consapevole riguardo la diaspora africana. Nel 2014 ha ottenuto laurea triennale in Relazioni Internazionali (Scienze Internazionali ed Istituzioni Europee) e nel  2015 ha completato il suo Master in Sociologia e Antropologia, il quale le ha dato le competenze e gli strumenti necessari per iniziare ad analizzare le problematiche di integrazione riguardante la comunità eritrea a Milano. Inoltre, è stato il punto di partenza per iniziare a scrivere il suo primo documentario, Appuntamento ai Marinai.</p>
<strong>TERZA STAGIONE </strong><p>Per la terza stagione di #Blackcoffee_pdc, prevista per aprile 2021, abbiamo due nuove collaborazioni e l’utilizzo di attrezzatura professionale. Una produzione completamente indipendente e per questo motivo il lancio della campagna di crowdfunding ci permetterà di coprire i costi di una stagione che si propone ricca di contenuti come le precedenti ma più ambiziosa.</p>
<p><strong>EN</strong> <strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>#Blackcoffee_pdc, the Italian podcast that tells black identities with no filter, was created by Ariam Tekle and Emmanuelle Maréchal. The podcast consists of interviews of black Italians who enrich the conversations around black identities through their work and initiatives. We intend to create a space for conversing and debating complex issues, and lesser-known topics reported superficially by the media.</p>
<p><strong>Co-hosts</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emmanuelle Maréchal </strong></p>
<p>Born in 1987, Emmanuelle is French-Cameroonian. Her Italian experience started in 2009 in Bologna through the international program exchange Erasmus. She lived in Bologna until 2014, where she completed a Master's degree in International Relations. During those five years, Emmanuelle observed how white Italy was and couldn't help noticing how speaking about race and racism was taboo and how much Italian people didn't know their history. Fond of History and the African diaspora in Europe, she created The LBDStories, an Instagram profile dedicated to telling her family story and stories of people from the African diaspora in Europe. For her podcast, she travelled to Italy to interview black Italians, and it is on that occasion, she met Ariam.</p>
<p><strong>Ariam Tekle</strong></p>
<p>Ariam Tekle is an Eritrean-Italian documentary filmmaker born and raised in Milan. The daughter of Eritrean immigrants, Ariam grew a conscious interest in the African diaspora. In 2014 she completed her BA in International Relations (International Sciences and European Institutions), and in 2015 her Master's degree in Sociology and Anthropology. The latter armed her with the knowledge and necessary skills, and tools to analyze the Eritrean community's integration issues in Milan. Her journey led her to write her first documentary,  Appuntamento ai Marinai.</p>
<p><strong>THIRD SEASON</strong></p>
<p>The third season of #Blackcoffee_pdc will go live in April 2021. For this new chapter of the podcast, we are collaborating with two experts. The production is entirely independent.

<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p>The men and women who flew and maintained the A-7 Corsair II series of aircraft have great stories to tell. We wish to record these stories, preserve them for posterity, and share them with as wide an audience as possible.</p>
<h3><strong>The Urgency</strong></h3>
<p>Sadly, some of those who've built, maintained, and flew the A-7 have passed away; however, many more are ready, willing and able to share their stories. It is our desire to record and document these stories before it's too late. This is important both to preserve the legacy of this great aircraft as well as to share with their stories with fans of the A-7, historians conducting research, and the descendants of those who tell their tales.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>What We Are Asking For </strong></h3>
<p>Our aim is to raise $10,000, These funds will both allow us to acquire the necessary professional production equipment, as well as to fund interviews, produce episodes, host them online, and promote them on social media. While certainly ambitious, attaining our funding goal will provide us the means to produce world-class content.</p>
<p>This is not a for-profit campaign...it is designed to cover the costs, nothing more. Your contribution in any amount is appreciated, and will go a long way in documenting our shared history.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>The Venues</strong></h3>
<p>Once edited, these historical interviews will be available for viewing on multiple platforms. These include:</p>

</div></div>","Summary
The men and women who flew and maintained the A-7 Corsair II series of aircraft have great stories to tell. We wish to record these stories, preserve them for posterity, and share them with as wide an audience as possible.
The Urgency
Sadly, some of those who've built, maintained, and flew the A-7 have passed away; however, many more are ready, willing and able to share their stories. It is our desire to record and document these stories before it's too late. This is important both to preserve the legacy of this great aircraft as well as to share with their stories with fans of the A-7, historians conducting research, and the descendants of those who tell their tales.

What We Are Asking For 
Our aim is to raise $10,000, These funds will both allow us to acquire the necessary professional production equipment, as well as to fund interviews, produce episodes, host them online, and promote them on social media. While certainly ambitious, attaining our funding goal will provide us the means to produce world-class content.
This is not a for-profit campaign...it is designed to cover the costs, nothing more. Your contribution in any amount is appreciated, and will go a long way in documenting our shared history.

The Venues
Once edited, these historical interviews will be available for viewing on multiple platforms. These include:

The A-7 Corsair II Association's Website  - www.corsair2.us
The Association's Facebook page - https://www.facebook.com/groups/589131077876310/
The Association's YouTube Channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIdJM07XHXgbk4...
The interactive A-7 kiosk installed at the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, FL
Our own website, www.corsair2tales.com

The More We Raise, the More We Can Do

Obviously, we wish to continue beyond the first year of production. If the response is such that we raise more than the requested amount, we will be able to expand our efforts...it's just that simple.

<h3>Calling all Totes-heads!</h3>
<p>We need your help to make our first-ever live recording of<i> Totes Recall</i> a reality. <i>Totes Recall</i> is a podcast where we talk about a movie we don't remember well, hit pause on our recording, go watch that movie, then come back and talk about everything we got wrong and everything we learned along the way. Now, for the first time ever, we want to share the entire Totes Recall experience with our fans! On February 22 at the Trylon Cinema in Minneapolis, the hosts of Totes Recall (Dan, Molly, Other Dan, and Beth) are going to record an episode where we try to recall the film <i>Men in Black</i> before your very eyes!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funds for movie theater rental, special merch production and all-important pizza. (As always, salad is a stretch goal.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Location: We've chosen Trylon Cinema because it's an amazing nonprofit theater run by wonderful people who genuinely care about the preservation of film. Karmically this is a nice counterbalance to the whole premise of our podcast. Cost of rental (including set up and take-down time) and securing film rights costs about $1,100. Other costs include merch production, postage, and pizza. (Yes, we really are going to have pizza.) Total cost for this project is $2,258.</li>
<li>Merch: Is there something more perfect than a Totes tote? No, there isn't. As far as we know, this is the best idea anyone has ever had. Also, T-shirts. Everyone loves T-shirts, we're pretty sure.</li>

<ul><li>Fundraising: If we don't meet our entire goal, we'll put the funds back into the podcast - accelerating our plans to upgrade our equipment and recording space. We are really gunning for this live podcast, though. Totes-heads have requested it, and we want to deliver. </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are a group of podcast hosts, standing in front of a podcast listener, googling that quote from Notting Hill. </p>
<ul><li>Truly, we love making <i>Totes Recall</i> for our listeners. We've been at this for three and a half years, producing 48 episodes of our monthly podcast. The longest-running request we have is to watch the movie with us, and we'd love to make that happen. </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The greatest risk is trying something new. We've seen a lot of movies and so we know there's something brewing when characters start talking about the big dance. I'm sure THAT will go off without a hitch, #amiright.</p>
<ul><li>Honestly, though, two of our four hosts put together large-scale projects and events professionally, we have a lot of extra technical audio support, and Trylon Cinema is tops. So, short of a meteor hitting the theater or the pizza place not delivering, we're feeling pretty good about our chances to pull this off. </li></ul>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you'd like to help, we encourage you to spread the word about this fundraiser and/or about Totes Recall generally. </p>
