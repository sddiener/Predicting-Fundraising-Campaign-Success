<p><em>Ream Eyso and Moni Mekhala </em>retells the sacred drama of the same name, a tale in which rivaling students of a powerful hermit bring life to lightning, thunder, and rain.  Weaving together interviews, essays, photographs, and illustrations, the book uses the story to explore the evolution of the Khmer classical dance tradition, the passage of leadership within artistic lineages, and the circumstances of today's women.  Contributors include award-winning choreographer Sophiline Cheam Shapiro, dance scholar Toni Shapiro-Phim, and visual artist Brian Mendez.</p>
<h1>KHMER CLASSICAL DANCE</h1>
<p>Developed over a thousand years ago as a prayer in movement for the deliverance of rain, fertility, and well-being, Khmer classical dance is a potent symbol of Cambodia's history and identity.  The art form suffered a great loss from 1975 - 1979 when communist radicals known as the Khmer Rouge took power and sought to create an egalitarian peasant society.  They brought about the deaths of nearly a third of Cambodia's entire population—included in that number were an estimated 90% of Khmer classical dance artists.  Following this tragic loss, dancers worked in the shadow of genocide and trauma to revive their art and the spirit of their people.  Today, nearly 40 years later, Cambodia's classical dancers still work in an environment of uncertainty as they breathe new life into their venerable heritage.</p>
<h1>20 GOOD PEOPLE</h1>
<p>I am looking for 20 good people to help me share the story of <em>Ream Eyso and Moni Mekhala</em> with the world.  Your support will allow me to print 50 exclusive print copies of the book, which will be given to a hand-picked group of people and institutions that I have identified to be caretakers of Khmer dance.  Your contributions will also allow me to publish <em>Ream Eyso and Moni Mekhala</em> as an e-book, ensuring that the rich knowledge it contains remains accessible to all.  Proceeds from the e-book will be donated to Khmer Arts, a transnational organization at the forefront of Khmer classical dance practice.</p>

<p><strong>SOPHILINE CHEAM SHAPIRO</strong><strong><span><strong> </strong></span></strong>is an internationally known choreographer, dancer and educator whose groundbreaking creative works, which have been performed on major stages across four continents, have infused the venerable Cambodian classical dance form with new energy and ideas.  She is the recipient of many honors, including National Heritage, USA Knight, Creative Capital, Guggenheim, Durfee and Irvine Dance Fellowships, plus the Nikkei Asia Prize for Culture.  Her essays have been published widely, and she’s a much sought after speaker.  She holds a degree in classical dance from Phnom Penh’s National School of Fine Arts and a BA in dance ethnology from UCLA.</p>
<p><strong>TONI SHAPIRO-PHIM</strong> is a cultural anthropologist and dance ethnologist with a specialization in the arts of Cambodia. She first conducted fieldwork in Cambodia in the early 1990s, and worked in Cambodian, Lao and Vietnamese refugee camps in Thailand and Indonesia before that. She received her Ph.D. from Cornell University, writing about the relationship between war and dance in Cambodia, and has held research and teaching positions focused on arts and social justice at the University of California, Berkeley (South and Southeast Asian Studies Department), Mills College (Women’s Leadership Institute), Yale University (Cambodian Genocide Program) and, most recently, at Bryn Mawr College (Anthropology and Dance Departments). She has participated in workshops and training on creativity and conflict transformation at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland and at Brandeis University’s Center for Ethics, Justice and Public Life.</p>
<p>Her writing has appeared in books on genocide (<em>Annihilating Difference: the Anthropology of Genocide</em>, 2002) and conflict transformation (<em>Dancing at the Crossroads</em>, in press), in journals and magazines about Asia and the arts, including <em>Fiber Arts</em>, <em>Dance Research Journal</em> and <em>Asian Arts and Culture</em>, and in international encyclopedias such as <em>The Encyclopedia of Asian Theatre</em>, 2007 and the <em>Oxford Encyclopedia of Theatre and Performance</em>, 2001. She is a co-editor of <em>Dance, Human Rights and Social Justice: Dignity in Motion</em>, 2008, and co-author of <em>Dance in Cambodia</em>, 1999.</p>
<p>She has received American Association of University Women, Asian Cultural Council, Hawaii Committee for the Humanities, Fulbright and MacArthur Foundation Peace Studies grants and fellowships, among other awards.</p>
<p><strong>PRUMSODUN OK </strong>is guided by love. He works to positively transform our world through his practice as an artist, teacher, storyteller and idea generator. His interdisciplinary performances contemplate Rene Daumal’s expression of “the avant-garde in antiquity,” mining the tradition of Cambodian classical dance to explore the intersection of contemporary social issues with new possibilities for performance. Prum has presented his original works at venues such as REDCAT (NOW Festival 2012, Studio 2009 &amp; 2010), Highways, KUNST-STOFF arts/fest, CounterPULSE and Pieter among others. His writings have been published by the Alliance for California Traditional Arts (ACTA), Salon.com, LA Stage Times, In Dance Magazine and featured by the California Dance Network. Among many honors, Prum is a TED Fellow, a Master Artist in ACTA's Apprenticeship Program, an Association of Performing Arts Presenters Artist Fellow, and was a mentee to Oguri through the Choreographers in Mentorship Exchange Grant. Currently, he is Associate Artistic Director of Khmer Arts and serves on the board of the Alliance for California Traditional Arts. Prum's projects in progress include an innovative book titled Ream Eyso and Moni Mekhala, a ""musical"" to be performed in Cambodian dance ritual, and the Sala Center for Art and Culture. To be based in central Long Beach—the poorest but most culturally dynamic area of the city—Sala will provide a platform for traditional performing artists to inspire young people, nurture healthy communities, and redefine the landscape of art and culture.</p>
<p>Last, and most certainly not least, Prum is forever thankful to the many teachers and mentors who have graced his life: dancers Sophiline Cheam Shapiro and Oguri; vanguard composer Charles Boone; filmmakers Ernie Gehr, Brook Hinton, Jeanne Liotta, and George Kuchar; opera director Peter Sellars; and scholars David Gere and Anurima Banerji.</p>
<p>Drawing, for <strong>BRIAN MENDEZ</strong>,<strong> </strong>is a dialogue and collaboration with the natural world.

By this action, communication with the materiality of all life on earth is allowed.</p>
<p>In his practice, Brian looks to the paper’s surface to speak to him, to respond to his hand’s movements and to guide it. He considers the result a symbiotic design, a glimpse of the world's collective ancestry, and a meditation on our relationship to nature and time. Brian considers the symbols that emerge from the collaboration to be an appeal to the visceral in all of us, an attempt at cataloguing the unnoticed and ignored which abounds, and the markings that we see when we close our eyes but do not sleep.

</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Dying to Go On
Vacation</i> is the humorous, and sometimes heartbreaking, story of faith,
hope, and struggle as a father receives a diagnosis of terminal cancer in the
middle of his most productive years. He goes on to explore how to live
positively even when bad things happen to good people.  </p>
<p>The story begins and ends on two very different vacations.
One where Marty Cauley has an attack that puts him into the hospital. What he
thinks is a simple case of indigestion is diagnosed as terminal cancer.
Suddenly his whole world changes. The book ends twenty-eight days later with
Cauley and his family away on another vacation to spend time getting used to
living while dying.</p>
<p>This book is a case study in making sure you are putting
first things first and making the most of every day of your life. Here is a
quote from the introduction:</p>
<p>“Do not wait until you are dying to go on vacation. I think
if I had one piece of advice to give you that would be it.…We understand life
is fleeting but we act as though it is endless. Then something happens to
remind us that it is not.” (p.9)</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to
share my book, <i>Dying to Go On Vacation: A journey of discovering life while facing death,</i> with you. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">By supporting this project you will help add a voice of encouragement to those who are facing difficult times and to their family members.

<h3></h3>
</div><h3>¿Qué?</h3><b>El mundo de las sombras</b> aborda una espeluznante realidad, y es que solo en Estados Unidos desaparecen cada año casi un millón y medio de personas; en la comisaría de Limehouse, al este de Londres, hay pendientes mil trescientos casos de desapariciones; y en nuestro país, en los últimos años, han desaparecido más de treinta mil personas... todas ellas con la consideración oficial de código uno.<br/><blockquote>
<p>“El mundo
está lleno de personas desaparecidas, y su número no deja de crecer. El espacio
que ocupan se sitúa entre lo que conocemos sobre las formas de estar vivo y lo
que sabemos de las formas de estar muerto. Por ahí vagan, sin compañía e incognoscibles,
como sombras”. </p>
<p><span> Es
lo que sucede en la ciudad de Q… Las personas desaparecen sin dejar rastro.
Aunque algunos desaparecidos llaman por teléfono a sus familiares.</span></p>
<p><span> Mediante
un diario, el protagonista trata de entender lo que está pasando en la ciudad.</span>
<span>Su hermana, María, también es un
desaparecido, una sombra, que es como los llaman en algunos barrios.
Desde luego la palabra está bien elegida, pues los desaparecidos son eso,
sombras; sombras sobre nuestra vida, sobre el mundo y sobre nuestra forma de
entenderlo; sombras sobre el pasado y sobre el futuro. “Es peor que saber que
está muerta. De verdad que lo es. De esta manera nunca dejas de buscarla, de
esperarla... ¿Qué está siendo de ella?”.</span></p> <span>Él mismo siente ahora</span>
el peor tipo de miedo que existe: la amenaza de que <span>algo lo elimine, acabe con su presencia, lo haga desaparecer.
Tan sólo con pensar qué puede ser ese algo
ya se estremece.</span>

“El mundo
está lleno de personas desaparecidas, y su número no deja de crecer. El espacio
que ocupan se sitúa entre lo que conocemos sobre las formas de estar vivo y lo
que sabemos de las formas de estar muerto. Por ahí vagan, sin compañía e incognoscibles,
como sombras”. 
 Es
lo que sucede en la ciudad de Q… Las personas desaparecen sin dejar rastro.
Aunque algunos desaparecidos llaman por teléfono a sus familiares.
 Mediante
un diario, el protagonista trata de entender lo que está pasando en la ciudad.
Su hermana, María, también es un
desaparecido, una sombra, que es como los llaman en algunos barrios.
Desde luego la palabra está bien elegida, pues los desaparecidos son eso,
sombras; sombras sobre nuestra vida, sobre el mundo y sobre nuestra forma de
entenderlo; sombras sobre el pasado y sobre el futuro. “Es peor que saber que
está muerta. De verdad que lo es. De esta manera nunca dejas de buscarla, de
esperarla... ¿Qué está siendo de ella?”. Él mismo siente ahora
el peor tipo de miedo que existe: la amenaza de que algo lo elimine, acabe con su presencia, lo haga desaparecer.
Tan sólo con pensar qué puede ser ese algo
ya se estremece.
¿Quiénes?Tandaia es
 una joven editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a 
autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes 
ideas como es el crowdfunding. De este modo eres tú, 
ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra 
que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro 
catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.Hoy te presentamos a Francisco Escaño Sánchez.

</p><p>1913’s FUNDRAISING/PRE-SALE/BOOK GIVEAWAY!</p>
<p>Please support our exciting NEW &amp; FORTHCOMING book projects
at 1913 Press!</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to announce the PRE-SALE of 3 BEAUTIFUL NEW
books:</p>
<p>-BRENDA IIJIMA’s Untimely Death is Driven Out Beyond the Horizon</p>
<p>-SARAH RIGGS’s Pomme &amp; Granite</p>
<p>-AMARANTH BORSUK &amp; KATE
DURBIN’s Abra</p>
<p>...all gorgeous &amp; ready to ship this SPRING!</p>
<p>We’re conducting this PRE-SALE via our current INDIEGOGO
FUNDRAISER. And with the purchase of any of the above NEW books, you’ll get a FREE
book from our catalog! (Please see Perks for details.)</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2003, 1913 has always been an IN-HOUSE
operation, a labor of love by its two editors, Sandra &amp; Ben Doller, in
collaboration with the 1913 authors and artists. Our funding has come from
working our full-time jobs, in addition to the occasional generous financial
support of our devoted friends and fans. </p>
<p>Like most small presses, we have incurred mucho debt from
publishing expenses (printing, mailing, promotion, conferences, book fairs) not
to mention the hundreds of hours of labor involved in book design, web design,
and running the press. Rather than take vacations, eat at restaurants, or buy
things, we make books!</p>
<p>Now, due to some major life changes (Ben got cancer last
year...and now we’re having a baby!) we absolutely need to shift many 1913 things
OUT-OF-HOUSE—which will entail hiring outside designers, finding a friendly web
updater, training talented managing editors and crew of assistants...all of
which require YOUR SUPPORT.</p>
<p>We’re trying to raise money for our new and forthcoming projects...but
our larger goal is, as always, to get the work OUT there and read by YOU! We
believe strongly in all our book projects...and we’re just tickled to announce
our next batch of amazing exciting superbad books on the way:</p>
<p>-BRAD FLIS’s Strong Suits</p>
<p>-LILY HOANG’s Old Cat Lady</p>
<p>-RONALDO WILSON’s Lucy 72</p>
<p>-JON COTNER &amp; ANDY FITCH’s Conversations Over Stolen
Food</p>
<p>-CYNTHIA ARRIEU-KING &amp; HILLARY GRAVENDYK’S Unlikely
Conditions</p>
<p>...and...</p>
<p>the winner of the 1913 Prize selected by Claudia Rankine:
LEIF HAVEN’s Arcane Rituals From the Future</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p>1913 Prize Editrice’s Choice: MIA YOU’s, I, Too, Dislike It</p>
<p>With your support of 1913 Press, we can not only see these
projects to fruition, but also keep the rest of our catalog IN PRINT—something
we really value as publishers, writers, editors, and readers. &amp; As ever,
we remain committed to publishing the freshest finest work out there, in
beautifully designed editions. </p>

you're welcome to choose to just DONATE TO SUPPORT 1913! Our lofty goal is to

<p>UNTIMELY DEATH IS DRIVEN OUT BEYOND THE HORIZON:</p>
<p>“Antigone enters. Pesticides, eco-cide,
a guiding conversation with Leslie<br/>
Scalapino and the beloved dead. The drone poem and the brain-body of the<br/>
dancer. Brenda Iijima gets at the horror of our capitalist daily: the nation<br/>
as prison-industrial complex, flickering beneath an alluring scrim of<br/>
chemically-bright lawns and Mountain Dew. Her poetry pierces the veil, and<br/>
this dense, velvety and deeply charged writing is a timely call and warning:<br/>
also a furnace of the imagination. It 'plunges the brain into darkness where<br/>
it doesn't fester'.” -Lauren Levin</p>
<p>POMME &amp; GRANITE: </p>
<p>“These under- and above-ground journeys inhabit and enliven
that rich mystery, shuttling between the self and beloved, the world and all
its myths. It is a place &amp; we live here, / under the grass, over the earth.
Chthonic lyrics pulled up with the roots intact, hard, sweet, and sustaining.” –Eleni
Sikelianos</p>
<p>ABRA: </p>
<p>“A cell calls to itself, splits: a caul is knit. In the
intimacy of the not-self-same is birthed a third thing: a second sight. Just so
in the clairvoyant, collaborative between-spaces (media) of Abra's triple play.
A 'rococo glow', a 'sparkle spasm', a transcriptase strip-tease at once
cellular and galactic. Can protein have a fantasy life? Does cancer wish to
conquer?  Is thought just the comfort food our brain cells grant us while
pursuing their own ends? The precise articulation of Abra reflects the
considerable skill of its human compositors, yet hints at acute, occluded
dramas unfolding just beyond human scales.” -Joyelle McSweeney </p>

<h3>In six weeks I leave for the CDT. I went to the dentist on Monday and discovered that I need two $1100 crowns.</h3> <p>I'd been procrastinating going to the dentist for over a year. One of my molars has recently been giving me pain and sort of storing food inside itself. Another one is cracked. I can't put this dental work off any longer, and I definitely can't set out on a 2,800 mile hike with this problem.  <br/></p> <ul> <li>Fixing my teeth would require spending my CDT funds </li> <li>Which would mean no hiking the wild CDT and writing daily blog posts about it for you<br/>
</li> <li>This sux</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>However! <br/>
</h3> <p>You, dear reader, can send me to hike the CDT.</p>
<p><b>I currently have 2,300 blog followers- if each person following my 
blog contributed $1, I'd instantly be able to get the crowns I need, and
 hike the CDT, and blog about it for you.</b></p>
<p>I'm going to call that <b>crowdfunding magic.</b><br/></p>
<p> The 2,800 mile Continental Divide Trail is wilder, more arduous, and longer than
 the PCT. There is less water, less trail, more inclement weather, and 
much more overland navigation. Only a few dozen people thru-hike the CDT each year, compared to hundreds on the PCT. Hiking the CDT feels, I imagine, a little
 like what it must've felt like to hike the PCT in the seventies. The 
saying for the CDT is ""Embrace the Brutality"".<br/></p>
<p>Aside from the Lowest to Highest Route, I have never hiked a ""trail"" this wild. I have maps, shoes, and all my gear. I'm so excited I can hardly stand it. And how badly do you want to read about this adventure?!  </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Why do this?</h3>
<p>Because you want to read what I'm going to write. Because you believe in me. Because the lack of access to affordable dental care in this country sux.</p>
<h3>As thanks, I promise to write one blog post for every single day I'm on the trail. No matter how tired, sunburnt, hungry, or vaguely hypothermic I am. One blog post for each day, all for you. <br/>

I can't put this dental work off any longer, and I definitely can't set out on a 2,800 mile hike with this problem.    Fixing my teeth would require spending my CDT funds  Which would mean no hiking the wild CDT and writing daily blog posts about it for you
 This sux    However! 
 You, dear reader, can send me to hike the CDT.
I currently have 2,300 blog followers- if each person following my 
blog contributed $1, I'd instantly be able to get the crowns I need, and
 hike the CDT, and blog about it for you.
I'm going to call that crowdfunding magic.
 The 2,800 mile Continental Divide Trail is wilder, more arduous, and longer than
 the PCT. There is less water, less trail, more inclement weather, and 
much more overland navigation. Only a few dozen people thru-hike the CDT each year, compared to hundreds on the PCT. Hiking the CDT feels, I imagine, a little
 like what it must've felt like to hike the PCT in the seventies. The 
saying for the CDT is ""Embrace the Brutality"".
Aside from the Lowest to Highest Route, I have never hiked a ""trail"" this wild. I have maps, shoes, and all my gear. I'm so excited I can hardly stand it. And how badly do you want to read about this adventure?!  
  Why do this?
Because you want to read what I'm going to write. Because you believe in me. Because the lack of access to affordable dental care in this country sux.
As thanks, I promise to write one blog post for every single day I'm on the trail. No matter how tired, sunburnt, hungry, or vaguely hypothermic I am. One blog post for each day, all for you.

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Story of my Book </span></h3>
<div><p><i>On the Tips of Her Fingers</i> is inspired by Slovak fairy and folk tale traditions, tracking a young girl’s journey as she travels far from home. It is a fictional work that focuses on the idea of magic, monsters, and the courage to overcome the darker corners of life. My book will publish in Winter 2020.<br/><br/>My name is Bibiana and I am the author of <i>On the Tips of Her Fingers.</i> I wrote this book as an homage to the fantastical dark fiction I read as a young girl, cloaked in magic and grand faraway worlds. It is simultaneously a nod to my roots. I was born in Slovakia and grew up listening to, reading, and watching beautiful fairytales that were heavily inspired by nature and the world I was born into. Instead of high-rise buildings, you’ll read about quaint cabins and grand castles cradled by dense woods, powdery snow, and pine trees.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover and regain a little bit of magic in the everyday. My book can offer escapism, yet encourage the reader to face difficult situations head-on. It will offer the magic of powers and abilities. And it will force the reader to acknowledge that there is a power in perseverance and courage.<br/><br/><strong>I want you to see this book as an escape from the world around you... to find joy in faraway worlds and magic within.</strong><br/><br/><i>On the Tips of Her Fingers</i> centers around a protagonist named Adela, who leads an otherwise normal life in a countryside. The world is called Sunseree, and it is loosely influenced by the town where I was born. Adela lives in a cozy cottage with her mother, who spins fantastical tales for her at night. A series of strange and dark events leads to her being gifted with special abilities that allow her to escape the world around her and help her cope with difficult feelings and emotions.<br/><br/>As Adela travels from place to place, she begins to uncover and unravel the mysteries of her family and town, stumbling through each phase of discovery until the story comes to a close. Through her adventures, we meet friends and acquaintances, magical creatures and talking animals, villains and evil characters. Through it all, Adela begins to understand the impact of self-identity, of self-esteem, and of courage and determination.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you enjoy dark fantasy fiction. If you enjoy reading about magic and fantastical worlds, people, and creatures, you will love this book. <i>On the Tips of Her Fingers</i> speaks to children and adults, fans of fiction and fairytales, and fans of magic realism who want to grapple with the concepts of escapism and self-identity and love in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>On the Tips of Her Fingers</i> inspires reflection and sparks a moment of magic in life.</p></div>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Book </span></h3>
<p>The book features a number of characters, both friends and foes. It centers around a main protagonist, her home, and the mysterious circumstances of the environment around them.<br/><br/><strong>Adela:</strong> Adela is our main protagonist. She is a young girl and can be quite neurotic and aloof, preferring the comforts of a book and the presence of her family. She has difficulty coping with her emotions, and due to a serendipitous series of events, learns to escape and explore the vast and magical world around her.<br/><br/><strong>Sunseree: </strong>Adela hails from a bucolic village called Sunseree, where quaint cottages stand out before a backdrop of snow-topped mountains, clear, frozen-over lakes, and a dark forest housing curious creatures.<br/><br/><strong>The Last Sun:</strong> As Adela traverses different towns and cities, she does so under the cover of darkness. The world has been plunged into perpetual nighttime, and the sun has suddenly disappeared. Through her journeys, Adela begins to uncover the mysteries of what happened...<br/><br/>In the first part of the novel, we are introduced to Adela, her family, and the curious adventures that Adela embarks on.<br/><br/>In the second part, our protagonist explores new places: Nuimtree, the Forgotten City, New Kitfalls, Old Kitfalls, and more...<br/><br/>In the final part, the secrets of Adela’s family and the world around her are unveiled.<br/><br/><i>To help set the scene, below are a few excerpts from the novel:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>“When Lucia had been pregnant with Adela, she loved to open all the windows in the room and bring her paints upstairs. When the roosters crowed 'good morning' to when the stars began to twinkle, Lucia created imaginative scenes with the flick of her brush and colors of blue, gold, emerald, and pink. Adela’s spine tingled in awe when she first heard the story, taking in the story in front of her. It was a humble depiction of the village just below the grassy knoll.“</li>
<li>“Her gold sun tingled, and the young girl sensed something wrong. ‘Yes... of course,“ she lied. She pried the jar from the young woman’s grasp and began to back out of the stone house. ’I should really get going now,’ she stammered, as she reached for the doorknob.”</li>
<li>“The warmth pulsed through her upper body, spreading to her legs and her toes from that singular point. Her mother always had this unusual ability to warm anything she touched; it was particularly useful on these cold nights, when the wintry weather would creep into the cracks of wood and escape into the bedrooms. Prompted by the smile spreading on her face, the palms lifted off her chest and she heard a whispered 'I love you' before the door closed and the room was enveloped in darkness once more.“</li>

</p><p></p><span><p><b>So why a sequel?</b></p>
<p>Hey there - this is Jennifer Anne Champion, Daryl Qilin Yam, and Joshua Ip.</p>
<p>We are the editors of <i>SingPoWriMo 2015: The Anthology</i>, picked from a larger team of moderators that oversaw this month-long, write-a-poem-a-day challenge. Inspired by the fruits of last year's labours, we collectively decided that SingPoWriMo is more than just a thing you do on Facebook for the heck of it - it's an annual gathering of like-minded people, a rigorous exercise both demanding and rewarding, as well as a bold, balls-out foray into the literary scene.</p></span><p>Our dear Facebook group has grown to over 1,300 members in our sophomore year, and needless to say, a ton of poems had been generated over April by poets both seasoned and fresh out of the boat. Liwulis? Check. Lipograms? Check. Empat perkataans? Ch-ch-check. Singapore literature is the beast that just refuses to die, and this year's edition of the anthology seeks to collect the best of these poems in a sizeable volume, published and released by Math Paper Press this coming November.<br/></p><div>Poetry Is Coming.<p></p>
<p><b>How does the money work?</b></p>
<p>We've streamlined our process of going through and vetting which poems are read and which poems aren't - nevertheless, we do think the final manuscript will come in at around 150 pages. So the approximate cost of producing an anthology will be (all costs in SGD):</p>
<p>1. ~$2500 in printing costs</p>
<p>2. ~$1000 in design/layout costs</p>
<p>3. Marketing/Distribution costs</p>
<p>Math Paper Press will be covering items 2 and 3, but in the community-driven spirit of SingPoWriMo, we're going back to Indiegogo to raise funds for this anthology and ease the financial burden off MPP's backs. Because last year's fund-raising effort was such a success, we're sticking to our goal of $1800 USD (~$2495.30 SGD) to defray as much of the printing costs as possible. And if we do manage to raise more funds than expected, free copies of the anthology will be given out to schools and and other places that can afford more exposure to local literature, so it's all good!</p>
<p><b>Why should I care?</b></p>
<p>Because Singapore Lit matters. <span>Because you love all things to do with the making of books, the making of stories, the making of exquisite things with words alone. Because, for some strange reason, you feel inspired to write poetry of your own, but don't know how to go about doing it and making your own voice heard.</span></p>
<p>Because you just have a lot of spare cash lying around, and you want to throw it to a project whose editors and publishers are starving, like, literally. Because your friend is in the anthology and you know, yeah, you know. Because there are young kids in schools who are made to think that literature is not important, not essential to our daily lives, and simply not fun at all to do or read or study. Because this book is testament that literature is all games and hard work and rainbows and the small miracles that happen when a good poem comes together. And because this book is about a thousand people, telling one another to have another go at this wonderful, frustrating, and yet altogether mind-defying smorgasm of a poetry challenge.</p>
<p>Because SingPoWriMo is not simply about you, or me - it's all about all of us, and that same yet strangely variegated language we all speak in: poetry.</p>
<p><b>Alright alright, now tell me: what do I get for being awesome?</b></p>
<p>Ahem - you're gonna like what we're offering this year (all donations in USD and adjusted for inflation):</p>
<p>$3 - Our Forever And Always Undying Love: We will love you. We really will.</p>
<p>$12 - Fastest Fingers Firstest: A pre-order copy of the anthology at a very special price (~$16.65 SGD). Only for the first 30 orders. Collection only at the launch event and BooksActually (9 Yong Siak St, Singapore 168645).</p>
<p>$14 - Faster Fingers Not-As-Firstest-But-Still-Good: A pre-order copy of the anthology at a rather special price (~$19.41 SGD). Collection only at the launch event and BooksActually (9 Yong Siak St, Singapore 168645).</p>
<p>$20 - Signed, Sealed, Delivered: A pre-order copy of the anthology with signatures from all editors, delivered to your doorstep via post.</p>
<p>$36 - Eh, Credit Me Please: Everything in the $20 tier, plus your name in the acknowledgments. People will know you as That Guy, and they will love you for it.</p>
<p>$49 - The Leit Companion: Everything in the $36 tier, except your copy of the anthology will have pages / sections / poems furiously scribbled on and annotated by a mysterious literary (double) agent with a Hawke-ish personality, a Bourne-ian approach to bad puns, and Bond-esque inclination towards imperfect form... not to mention mysterious handwriting and a bucketful of snark.</p>
<p>$69 - Patron of the Arts: Everything in the $36 tier, plus an original poem by the editors specifically written for the donors, in a beautiful, one-of-a-kind postcard-sized print. We'll do our best.</p>
<p>$88 - The Leit Motif Prize: Everything in the $36 tier, except this time Leit Motif hands you 2 copies of the anthology and a poem of her very own in a postcard print, tucked somewhere amongst the leaves for your own perusal...</p>

Singapore literature is the beast that just refuses to die, and this year's edition of the anthology seeks to collect the best of these poems in a sizeable volume, published and released by Math Paper Press this coming November.Poetry Is Coming.
How does the money work?
We've streamlined our process of going through and vetting which poems are read and which poems aren't - nevertheless, we do think the final manuscript will come in at around 150 pages. So the approximate cost of producing an anthology will be (all costs in SGD):
1. ~$2500 in printing costs
2. ~$1000 in design/layout costs
3. Marketing/Distribution costs
Math Paper Press will be covering items 2 and 3, but in the community-driven spirit of SingPoWriMo, we're going back to Indiegogo to raise funds for this anthology and ease the financial burden off MPP's backs. Because last year's fund-raising effort was such a success, we're sticking to our goal of $1800 USD (~$2495.30 SGD) to defray as much of the printing costs as possible. And if we do manage to raise more funds than expected, free copies of the anthology will be given out to schools and and other places that can afford more exposure to local literature, so it's all good!
Why should I care?
Because Singapore Lit matters. Because you love all things to do with the making of books, the making of stories, the making of exquisite things with words alone. Because, for some strange reason, you feel inspired to write poetry of your own, but don't know how to go about doing it and making your own voice heard.
Because you just have a lot of spare cash lying around, and you want to throw it to a project whose editors and publishers are starving, like, literally. Because your friend is in the anthology and you know, yeah, you know. Because there are young kids in schools who are made to think that literature is not important, not essential to our daily lives, and simply not fun at all to do or read or study. Because this book is testament that literature is all games and hard work and rainbows and the small miracles that happen when a good poem comes together. And because this book is about a thousand people, telling one another to have another go at this wonderful, frustrating, and yet altogether mind-defying smorgasm of a poetry challenge.
Because SingPoWriMo is not simply about you, or me - it's all about all of us, and that same yet strangely variegated language we all speak in: poetry.
Alright alright, now tell me: what do I get for being awesome?

Gitarista is the story of Alejandro Sebastian, a young guitar virtuoso thrust into the classical arts scene of 1970s Manila, Philippines.
Raised by a single mother in the province, Alejandro returns to the capital as a teenage freshman at the Conservatory of Music where his mentor, maestro Pablo Rocca II, trains him to become a guitar grandmaster. He meets Dani, a free-spirited violinist, who becomes a close friend and inspiration.
Alejandro’s musical journey takes place during the height of urban progress: buildings towered over paved roads, vehicles caused traffic jams, business districts were expanding and the music and arts scene was a burgeoning form of entertainment and a stark representation of the country’s national identity.
From Manila's iconic attractions such as the scenic Roxas Boulevard, the walled city of Intramuros, the tunnels of Quiapo, the hills of San Juan, the lake of Laguna, the coliseum of Cubao to the majestic theater of the CCP—Gitarista is a young man's search for the symphony of his life.
 

MUSIC SOUNDTRACK (via mp3 download)
While it is unusual for books to have its own music soundtrack, the themes in Gitarista make it a fitting supplement. Though, rest assured, one may still enjoy the novel thoroughly even without it.

WHY DO THIS
I believe that one of the best ways to share one's historical roots across cultures is through an engaging narrative.
Because of hundreds of years of colonization by China, Spain, America, Japan, and the 20-year rule of a dictator, Philippine local literature has often dwelled on the struggles and oppression the country has endured. This book veers in the opposite direction. It wasn’t all that bad.
Though the Philippines is classified as a third-world nation, unknown to most, it has one of the most vibrant cities in the world and has produced some of the best classical musicians and artists since the late 1900s.
The book is a fictional romanticization of how western music (classical and pop music) fused itself with native ears and influenced not just a culture of art and music, but an emotionally, colorful lifestyle as well.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">One of my passions is helping other people with their writing. I honestly get as much joy from seeing friends achieve as I do from my own achievements.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I want to use what I’ve learned over the years of writing and editing to work with new writers, teaching them skills and about the industry and giving them a platform to showcase their talent. I came up with the idea of a series of anthologies based on publishing online and decided to use the next novel advance I got to fund it.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">However, with publishing slowing down and taking their time while they negotiate the changes to the industry, that new novel advance is taking longer than I thought and I’m sick of waiting. I want to get stuck into helping writers now. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">That’s why I’m turning to you. I’m hoping there are folks out there who love the idea of new writers being given a hand and are willing to help me. Here’s how In fabula-divinos (The tale-tellers) will work.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Submission will open to any writer who has not yet had a professional sale on the first of the month and will close on the seventh. The submissions will be of speculative fiction stories (science fiction, fantasy or horror) of no more than two thousand words.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">On the eighth day I will choose one story and let that lucky person know. For the next three weeks, I’ll work closely with that author, helping them polish that particular story and answering any other questions about the industry they have.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">On the first of the next month, their story will appear on the In fabula-divinos website (<a href=""http://thetaletellers.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://thetaletellers.wordpress.com/</a>) and will remain there for that entire month. In the meantime, I will again open to submissions for the following month.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
 
One of my passions is helping other people with their writing. I honestly get as much joy from seeing friends achieve as I do from my own achievements.
 
I want to use what I’ve learned over the years of writing and editing to work with new writers, teaching them skills and about the industry and giving them a platform to showcase their talent. I came up with the idea of a series of anthologies based on publishing online and decided to use the next novel advance I got to fund it.
 
However, with publishing slowing down and taking their time while they negotiate the changes to the industry, that new novel advance is taking longer than I thought and I’m sick of waiting. I want to get stuck into helping writers now. 
 


The Impact
 
 
That’s why I’m turning to you. I’m hoping there are folks out there who love the idea of new writers being given a hand and are willing to help me. Here’s how In fabula-divinos (The tale-tellers) will work.
 
Submission will open to any writer who has not yet had a professional sale on the first of the month and will close on the seventh. The submissions will be of speculative fiction stories (science fiction, fantasy or horror) of no more than two thousand words.
 
On the eighth day I will choose one story and let that lucky person know. For the next three weeks, I’ll work closely with that author, helping them polish that particular story and answering any other questions about the industry they have.
 
On the first of the next month, their story will appear on the In fabula-divinos website (http://thetaletellers.wordpress.com/) and will remain there for that entire month. In the meantime, I will again open to submissions for the following month.
 
At the end of the twelve months, the twelve stories (plus a story from myself and some of my established writer friends) will be gathered and published.
 


What We Need & What You Get
 
 I need $2500 to get through the next twelve months of payments to the authors, to get cover art and layout done and to publish the first anthology, both electronically and in print.  I hope the sales of that anthology will fund the next twelve months of the project.
 
I can get started as soon as I have the first $100. 
 
I’d really love this project to work and to have the opportunity to work with new writers and teach them what I’ve learnt so far. I hope that you’ll also want to be part of it all.

<p>Yes, Popcorn Press will publish this book one way or another, just as we published the previous Halloween collections. However, by contributing now instead of after publication, <em>(1) you'll receive a better deal, (2) you'll help us plan so we can pay the authors more, and (3) you'll help to build a buzz about the project--which may well result in a bigger book with more poems and fiction!</em></p>

<h3>THE BASICS</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is <strong>James Killough</strong>.  I'm a writer and filmmaker based out of L.A. who has written a middle-grade illustrated children's book called <strong>PEPPER PUMPERDINE AND THE FASHION FAIRY</strong>.<br/>I've decided to self-publish because I have a ton of experience editing and publishing books and magazines, so why not take control of it?  I've also always dreamed of starting my own imprint, so now's the time.  I'm going to call it <strong>The Pepper Press</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Only you can help make this happen.</strong></p>
One thing my experience has taught me is I need a fantastic editor, targeted marketing, and in this case an illustrator so good that people will want to collect his art. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have already identified a couple of crackerjack children's book editors with solid track records of producing hit children's books.  It took me three months to find illustrator <strong>Adam Oehlers</strong>, but I know he is the right person with whom I should team up, so it was worth the wait and the search.</div>
<p>Please check out the pitch video for more about the book and Adam's art.</p>
<div>
<h3>WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING?</h3>
<p>The costs break down simply:</p>
<ul>
<li>A top-of-the-line editor will be around <strong>$5,000</strong> (one of the quotes I got was a bit more);</li>
<li>
<strong>$7,500</strong> for Adam Oehlers' illustrations - the more I can commission from him, the more selection everyone has for the perks;</li>
<li>At least <strong>$3,000</strong> for marketing: Google AdWords; paying Kirkus reviews to cover it; various other hidden costs;</li>
<li>
<strong>$1,000</strong> for prints, and shipping and hard copies of the book for top-end contributors;</li>
<li>
<strong>Misc. costs</strong>, like joining the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators, and the fee Indiegogo takes.</li>
</ul>
<h3><img alt=""Adam Oehlers"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://purefilmcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/AdamOehlersBook2.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></h3>
<h3>WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?</h3>
<p>Do you have a kid in your life to whom you'd like to give <strong>a timeless gift</strong> to that will probably increase in value over the years?  Or are you collector of illustrations that are also fine art?  Whatever the purpose, most people have room in their lives for <strong>quality art</strong>, and I am fairly confident that what Adam Oehlers and I will create together will be something to treasure for generations.</p>
<p>Please take a moment to <strong>review the perks</strong> on the side.  Everyone gets at least one print of the illustrations signed by me, as well as at least one download of the book.  But what you really want are prints signed by both me and Adam, which start at $100.</p>
</div>
<h3>WHY IS PEPPER PUMPERDINE IMPORTANT?</h3>
<p>Some of you might be asking how a book about personal style can possibly be significant. But how we perceive ourselves is actually essential to leading a balanced life. You can never start too early to learn about the fundamentals of identity.</p>
<p>As I mention at the end of the video pitch, PEPPER PUMPERDINE AND THE FASHION FAIRY is more than just another kids' book.  It imparts valuable lessons for children and adults alike: never be ashamed of who you are; be yourself, don’t follow the herd; secrets can be burdensome; love your family and be kind to them no matter how weird and embarrassing they are; don’t regret what you don’t have, rather be grateful for the smallest things in life; humility gets you everywhere; and someone is going to spot that fake handbag eventually, so might as well buy the real thing.</p>
<p>This is my first children's book, but if it turns out half as well as other publications and books I've been involved with, it should have a healthy success.  As the first in a proposed series of Pepper Pumperdine adventures, I'm going to go the extra mile to make sure this pilot venture is as good as it can possibly be.</p>
<p>Again, that can only happen with your contribution.</p>
<p><img alt=""Adam Oehlers Cat"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://purefilmcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/AdamOehlers5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>HOW ELSE CAN YOU HELP?</h3>
If you can't contribute, but you still think this is a worthy idea, chances are you know someone in your circle of friends or your family who might be interested.  Again, the perks make great gifts that will only increase in value with time.</div>

<h3>The Pitch<br/>
</h3>For millenia, peace reigned throughout the lands, following a bittersweet victory against the evil king Cian. This victory came at great cost and with no small thanks to the Guardians, who used their special magic to obliterate Cian's armies and restore the land. Now, the Guardians are warned that Cian is returning, and they have little time to prepare. Focus swirls around Amae, a forest elf and new Guardian just coming into her powers; Ahern, a young, second-born prince unaware of his fate as a Dragon Warrior; and Somae, the strongest and oldest Guardian wielding the power of the sun. Along with their friends, they are called to aid Eamon, the long awaited savior, on a journey to cease Cian's power once and for all. <br/><br/>And that's just the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">first</span> book!<br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Project<br/>
</h3>
<p>So I'm sitting at my computer at 7:30 am, trying to muster up the strength to go back to my grey and beige cubicle, where I'll do mind-numbing work at a job I'm not really a good fit for anyway. Snow fell last night, and my poor old Crown Vic with no heat and no snow tires does not like slick roads. I wonder why I'm even thinking about risking life and limb to go to a job I so loathe. Sure, it pays the bills...but there is no <span style=""font-style: italic;"">passion</span>. The only thing I can think of all day, every day is writing. More specifically, writing more of this fantasy series I have going.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I started the project a few years ago with big dreams and zero 
budget. Much of the story was written on post-it notes or other scratch 
paper and then typed into a Word file when I could find time to borrow a
 computer or go to the library. Now I have a second-hand laptop that has
 done wonders for the production of this novel series.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The story is written to be enjoyed as simply that - a story; but a 
thorough reading will bring out many hidden treasures. It is meant to 
reach an audience of many ages, especially those whose imaginations 
still soar. Characters such as elves, gnomes, dragons, satyrs, and many 
other mystical beings roam the land and find themselves intertwined in 
their land's history and fate. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Much time has been spent researching various legends and fairy tales, with countless hours passed creating cultures, languages, geography, and other such things that come with an intricate fantasy world. At least three books will be included in the series, with each having their own guide book focused on these details. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I would like to see this series turned into at least one film.<br/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>First, I want to apologize for not having PayPal as an option. There are many reasons for this. If I am able to add PayPal later, I will certainly be doing that. In the meantime, if you would like to contribute via PayPal, you can use jaeladarling@yahoo.com for that.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Obviously, this is a large project. I want to have my hands in it as much as possible, and I want to do this as organically as possible. I prefer hiring independent artists, marketing agents, etc. I respect individual and small businesses and want to support them as much as I can.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Some of what this funding will cover:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>- Author's website (for book- and author-related purposes; <span style=""font-style: italic;"">not</span> a personal site)<br/></p>
<p>- Illustrator(s) for cover art, maps, and all other artwork related to the novels and specialty books.</p>
<p>- Start-up revenue for print-on-demand or similar.</p>
<p>- Marketing materials and/or publicity specialist(s)</p>
<p>- Necessary workshops related to self publishing</p>
<p>- Professional editing</p>
<p>- Any other costs related to self-publishing</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>All funds will go towards this project, regardless of whether or not the goal is reached. I have started a savings account specifically for this project and will do whatever I can to fund it.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I know I have set a high goal. As I was crunching numbers, I realized that it's going to take nothing short of a miracle to set this in motion. Here is a breakdown that is a little more specific:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>- Upwards of $15,000 for editing, printing, marketing, and distribution. <br/></p>
<p>- I will need to take up to a year or more off work to focus on this project. My rent for one year is about $4,000. This does not include electricity, and I am usually able to keep this down to $600-$700/year. This also does not include food, but I am a simple person and spend less than $100/month in groceries (less than $1,200 a year).<br/></p>
<p>- Illustrations/cover art will be commission-based, and the prices will vary. I have several artists to choose from, and the final amount of this campaign will decide which one I can use.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Those are just a few of the costs that are necessary for this project. I'll need to get away for a few months to do nothing but write. I do have a couple of places that I can go to for free, but I'd have to pay travel expenses. It all adds up!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">WHAT YOU GET:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I <span style=""font-style: italic;"">love</span> my readers, and I want to do everything I can to give back to those that have helped. Perks include signed copies, special editions, extra content, loads of specials! I promise this will be well worth your while. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please pray. Some of you may not be the ""praying"" type, but I am, and I sure could use all the prayers I can get. I've been straying from my path for too long. It's time to buckle down and get this thing done. Please pray for strength, wisdom, and that my goals will be met.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>And spread the word! Even if you're not a fantasy fan, maybe some of your friends are! Facebook and Twitter are good ways to promote. The greatest asset to an author is word-of-mouth, so please just start jabbering about the upcoming fantasy series to everyone that will listen.<br/></p>

<p>Join me in a new partnership of writer and reader to bring what I think is a thought-provoking, entertaining and truly unique little book to the world of readers.</p>
<p>My goal is to raise money to <strong>help me print and distribute 500 free copies </strong>of my newly published novel, <em>The Traveler,</em> to independent bookstores around the country. I'm hoping that by doing this, I can get booksellers excited about the book, and generate sales and word of mouth ""buzz.""</p>
<p>The next step after that is to adapt the novel into a screenplay and try to get it optioned as a movie.</p>
<h3><strong>What's <em>The Traveler</em> all about? </strong></h3>
<p><em>The Traveler </em>is a novel in form of a travelogue by a young 19th century doctor who loses his parents, brother, young wife, all within a handful of years. Seeking to find his way forward by connecting to his genealogical past, he embarks on a journey, both geographic and spiritual, which ultimately leads him to a new comprehension of life and death -- but not before his understanding of what's possible is turned upside down, and he witnesses reality itself being challenged. (Think <em>Gulliver's Travel</em> with <em>Twilight Zone </em>twists!)</p>
<p>As you read, you'll follow the Traveler's adventures from Balmoral Castle in Scotland, to King Arthur's Cornwall, then on to Ireland, where he meets the wild Russian, Vanya. You'll race across Europe with Vanya and the Traveler to Hungary to celebrate The Day That Death Never Comes, to Romania where the miracle of resurrection is performed by a humble monk, and finally to Stamm, Switzerland, where an old man seems able to grant the gift of eternal youth to beautiful young women.</p>
<p>In the course of this journey, you will discover, as the Traveler does, that sometimes imagination is truer than reality.</p>
<h3>What are people saying about 'The Traveler'?</h3>
<p>Written during my recent travels to England and Ireland,<em> The Traveler</em> came to me in a burst of imagination and practically wrote itself. Early readers have told me that the book has inspired their imagination and sense of wonder.</p>
<p>Judith Horky, author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/EarthShift-Judith-Horky/dp/0971186200/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373061865&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=judith+horky"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em>EarthShift</em></a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Soul-Shift-2012-Beyond-Judith-Horky/dp/0971186219/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373061900&amp;sr=1-2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em>SoulShift</em></a> had this to say about the book:</p>
<p> <em>I absolutely loved Tales of the Traveler. I couldn’t put it down. The stories resonated deeply into my heart, maybe my soul. It moves quickly, and the creative descriptions of the places visited, as well as the characters, are wonderful. I feel I really know this doctor and can visualize so much of his mystical life. It made me want to go traveling; to follow his tale to find where he experienced such amazing adventures.</em></p>

Join me in a new partnership of writer and reader to bring what I think is a thought-provoking, entertaining and truly unique little book to the world of readers.
My goal is to raise money to help me print and distribute 500 free copies of my newly published novel, The Traveler, to independent bookstores around the country. I'm hoping that by doing this, I can get booksellers excited about the book, and generate sales and word of mouth ""buzz.""
The next step after that is to adapt the novel into a screenplay and try to get it optioned as a movie.
What's The Traveler all about? 
The Traveler is a novel in form of a travelogue by a young 19th century doctor who loses his parents, brother, young wife, all within a handful of years. Seeking to find his way forward by connecting to his genealogical past, he embarks on a journey, both geographic and spiritual, which ultimately leads him to a new comprehension of life and death -- but not before his understanding of what's possible is turned upside down, and he witnesses reality itself being challenged. (Think Gulliver's Travel with Twilight Zone twists!)
As you read, you'll follow the Traveler's adventures from Balmoral Castle in Scotland, to King Arthur's Cornwall, then on to Ireland, where he meets the wild Russian, Vanya. You'll race across Europe with Vanya and the Traveler to Hungary to celebrate The Day That Death Never Comes, to Romania where the miracle of resurrection is performed by a humble monk, and finally to Stamm, Switzerland, where an old man seems able to grant the gift of eternal youth to beautiful young women.
In the course of this journey, you will discover, as the Traveler does, that sometimes imagination is truer than reality.
What are people saying about 'The Traveler'?
Written during my recent travels to England and Ireland, The Traveler came to me in a burst of imagination and practically wrote itself. Early readers have told me that the book has inspired their imagination and sense of wonder.
Judith Horky, author of EarthShift and SoulShift had this to say about the book:
 I absolutely loved Tales of the Traveler. I couldn’t put it down. The stories resonated deeply into my heart, maybe my soul. It moves quickly, and the creative descriptions of the places visited, as well as the characters, are wonderful. I feel I really know this doctor and can visualize so much of his mystical life. It made me want to go traveling; to follow his tale to find where he experienced such amazing adventures.
My daughter, Jane Roper, an Iowa Writers' Workshop Grad and author of Double Time and Eden Lake, had kind words about my work. (And she's one of my toughest critics.) 
 “Gar Roper has crafted a book that is moving, magical and utterly unique. Each picturesque, deceptively simple tale in this volume illuminates the fine line between what is real and what is true.""

<h3> </h3>
<p>Hello. Maybe we've met before. Maybe we haven't. My name is Matty. I was born almost 24 years ago. I went to college. Im not sure how much I learned. I studied about God. I studied what I thought could know for certain. I left with nothing. Back then, the nothingness haunted me. Left me sleepless and full of despair.  Now the nothingness makes me smile. I don't think I know anything. I hope you could teach me something. </p>
<p>I wrote Cross Talk over the past two years. In coffee shops. On the basement floor of the Sullivan's in Northeast Portland. At my childhood home in Livermore. Alongside my father. My grandmother. I wrote in silence. I was at my lowest. Paralyzed by my own existence. The permanence of my words were not ready to be spoken. They are now. This isn't a book. It's a collection of experiences. It's like a long walk. You and I are just talking it out.</p>
<p>The importance of Cross Talk is to start an ongoing conversation. It's not for my benefit or fame. Those things don't mean anything. I want to open the door and invite you into my world. The pain. The beauty. Hopefully we can meet in the middle. Cross Talk is about God. Christianity. My own struggles with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Decisions. Freedom. Loss. Love. Travel.</p>
<p>If you choose to help me financially, I can share. As I share, it is my hope you will share too. These are not my words, they're from somewhere else. I'm only a mouthpiece. </p>
<p>Unfortunately creative endeavors cost money. I'll be direct. I need 2,500$ to print Cross Talk  150 copies and pay those who have helped with editing, promoting, and design. In between $2000-$2200 will be dedicated to the printing process. the remaining $300 will be distributed to those who had a hand in helping. I want to share this with you. I don't want to make money. </p>
<p>For those of you who give generous contributions, I will be in contact regarding the perks of such donations. I thought about making the perks more concise based on specific dollar amounts contributed, but I'd much rather work out the details with you personally.</p>
<p>More than a tangible piece of myself, I want to share with you so you can share yourself with others. Any help, whether strictly financial or strictly communicative is, and will be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>I'm glad we've met. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

Como pez en regaliz narra una historia optimista y llena de esperanza; un viaje hacia la madurez a través del cual nuestro personaje se encontrará a sí mismo.
Si a Lucas Graham le hubieran dado a elegir entre ser un Especial o vivir fuera del alcance de la magia, no habría dudado en decantarse por la segunda opción. Sin embargo, Lucas no puede cambiar su vida. Él es un Especial y lo será para el resto de sus días. La profecía, por el contrario, tambaleará su modo de ver las cosas. ¿Podrán Lucas y sus amigos reunir el poder suficiente para salvar La Academia?

<h2>The Story Behind My Book</h2>Give it Our All is an overview of the non-profit sector within the United States. As someone who is passionate about charity, my interest lies in enlightening readers on its current state and the potential of what I am calling “sustainable charity”.<br/><br/>My name is Jennifer Ailey and I am the author of Give It Our All. I was interested in writing this book because of my experience talking about being a non-profit professional. It is primarily met with optimism and positive questions. Unfortunately, there are also times where it has been met with dismissive responses due to the perception that wages are incredibly low. Whether or not that is true is dependent on the organization and its mission, but my hope is to expand readers’ preconceived ideas. I particularly want to engage with my generation on the variety of forms in which charity takes shape, and why it is so important to give.<br/><br/>In reading this book, my hope is to share how rewarding charity can be. Because of the diversity in charitable campaigns and organizations I also hope to encourage a newfound respect for non-profit/charity leaders. Ultimately, I want you to see this book used as a tool to both aid where understanding charitable passions lie and how to successfully put those to good use.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about grant writing and professionalism. You'll hear stories such as...<ul>
<li>The gravity grant writing holds, especially for smaller, lesser known organizations</li>
<li>First hand experiences of the professionalization of the non-profit sector</li>
<li>Where effective altruism grew from and why you should implement it in your daily life</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are a history buff, a future entrepreneur, or if you enjoy any sort of volunteer work.<br/><br/>Give It Our All is a nonfiction book that speaks to both Gen Z and working professionals who want to look at ethical business strategies in a new way or expand your volunteer network.</p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<p>The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in <strong>April 2021.</strong></p>
<p>The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</p>
<p>The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</p>
<p>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</p>
<p>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish in late Spring/early Summer. </p>
<p><strong><u>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. </u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. </u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.</u></strong></p>
<p>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.</li>
<li>Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.</li>
<li>You will receive early access to the Introduction and other excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review them and give me early feedback.</li>
<li>You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title.</li>
<li>You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.</li>

<p><strong>About the Author</strong><br/><br/>Jennifer is a recent graduate of Dickinson College, where her studies focused on English Literature and American Studies. Writing has always been a huge passion of hers, thus making the possibility to write a book an extraordinary opportunity. She currently works at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia as a visitor associate.<br/><br/>Emboldened by her past professional experiences in creative non-profit spaces, Jennifer knew that her inkling towards charity was greater than the occasional visit. But there were times where her optimism on non-profit organizations was met with dismissive responses on the low wages and difficult success rates associated with the sector. Her point of entry into the research was to investigate this perception and illuminate other positive attributes of working for a non-profit.<br/><br/>Jennifer is outgoing, forward-thinking, and fun. She is often placed in leadership roles, both professionally and recreationally, because of her natural charisma. She is capable of banter with almost anyone and loves to get the conversation going. To complement writing, she spends a lot of her time reading novels and memoirs or stretching it out on a yoga mat!<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Jennifer at aileyj97@gmail.com and on her <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jennailey/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram Page</a></p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p> The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.<br/> <p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p> Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:<p>Please share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #[GiveItOurAll] and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so that we can help amplify your efforts.</p>
<p>You can easily share my pre-sale campaign via Indiegogo at the top of the page.</p>
<p>Please share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it via text or direct message on social media.</p>
<p><u><strong>I truly appreciate support of any kind! </strong></u></p>
<p>Thank you so much, <br/>Jennifer Ailey</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<i>The Impact Mind: Understanding How to Drive Social Change in the New Economy</i> uncovers the 12 key principles that can make you a more impactful individual. There has been a strong push to make positive change in our communities, but it can be difficult to know where to start or how to do that. Through insights from leaders across emerging industries, my book will help you pave a path to creating impact in today’s globalized world.<br/><br/>My name is Fareeha Mahmood and I am the author of <i>The Impact Mind: Understanding How to Drive Social Change in the New Economy</i>. I’m from Dhaka, Bangladesh, but I lived in Jakarta and Dubai before starting college in New York City. In every city I lived, I always witnessed a stark contrast between the life I was living and the lives of others. The unique mixture of luck, privilege and hard work (of my parents’ and a bit of mine) landed me in a position where I could harness these opportunities to truly make an impact.<br/><br/>I was determined to spark positive, tangible change. I wondered, “What are the new and innovative ways of creating social impact? What careers could I pursue to be most impactful? How would I get there?” To answer all of those questions, I wrote this book!<br/><br/>I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for driving social change, in you. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover your ability to be impactful. From the stories I’ve gathered and collected, I’ve extracted key pieces of wisdom that can help you shape your life around your mission and make a change in the world.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn how to incorporate the 12 principles of The Impact Mind just like today's pioneers of change. Some of the principles include:<ul>
<li>
<strong>Discover your Mission</strong>: Amany Killawi, a driven and selfless entrepreneur who started off as a social worker, propelled by the desire to empower Detroit’s Muslim community after 9/11. As she got involved in fundraising for inner city youth, she discovered the power of crowdfunding and sought to bring it to the Muslim community by co-founding <a href=""https://www.launchgood.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LaunchGood</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lead with Impact</strong>: Rehana Nathoo, whose incredible careers in social finance at BNY Mellon, Rockefeller Foundation and Case Foundation ultimately inspired her to found her own impact investing strategy firm, <a href=""https://www.spectrum-impact.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Spectrum Impact</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Be Driven to Act</strong>: Chris Molaro, a former Army captain whose first-hand experiences with the inadequate and ill-equipped mental health system left him frustrated. Determined to advance the mental health space, he co-founded <a href=""https://www.neuroflow.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NeuroFlow</a>, an integrated behavioral health platform that helps doctors engage their patients’ mental health through data and evidence-based practices.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><i>The Impact Mind</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to driven and ambitious individuals who are looking to explore impact-oriented roles. You will love this book if you are curious to learn how can you maximize your impact - whether that’s through small, local changes or even large scale and structural ones. I hope the unique stories I share resonate with you and show you that there’s no one way to create social impact.</p>
<h3>The Book - The Impact Mind</h3>
<p>The book is written in 2 Parts...<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction and the first chapter which provides an overview of the 12 principles by defining key terms and provides context of social impact in the new economy. You’ll get a glimpse into the exciting stories that encapsulate the impact mindset.<br/><br/>Part 2 includes Chapters 2-13. Each chapter includes stories of individuals who are creating an impact through their passions and fascinating careers. The chapters show how each change maker integrated these principles into their mission and how you can do the same. The chapters include stories from Essma Bengabsia, Georgia Grace Edwards and countless other trailblazers driving impact.</p>

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>
<p><i>Tasting YOUR OWN Medicine: How to Advocate for Yourself in Healthcare Settings</i> is a book meant to empower individuals to take control of their medical decisions and to advocate for themselves during conversations with their health professionals and in determining the course of their care. It includes research and narratives from people who have experienced the healthcare system as patients or loved ones of patients and from professionals working within the system itself, while also including some of my own personal experiences as a patient.<br/><br/>My name is Karan Mirpuri and I am the author of <i>Tasting YOUR OWN Medicine</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to provide individuals with an understandable, narrative-based resource that gives them guidance on how to become involved in their conversations with their health professionals. Being inquisitive and curious about your care does not make you a bad patient and providing patients with that voice both as a loved one and a health professional can be immensely valuable in their ultimate outcomes and benefit all parties involved. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover novel techniques to make conversations with your health professionals easier and less scary. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for patient advocacy and health education and awareness. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you navigate situations and conversations pertaining to your own health and supporting others who you care about in similar instances.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the doctor-patient relationship, emotional literacy, and the value of self-care. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<p><i>From Karan to Karen</i> - My journey going “undercover” as an expecting mother attending various Zoom classes on childbirth and pregnancy. It is filled with humorous moments and valuable insights about what we can learn from the doula model of care to support those we love through their medical experiences.</p>
<p>Emily Ross - The story of a young teenage girl in Michigan and how a simple blood test made her realize the value of being thorough and doing your due diligence as a patient.</p>
<p>Fred Lee - Having served as a vice president at two major medical centers and a cast member at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fred Lee provides valuable insight regarding what the medical field can learn from amusement parks to enhance the quality of their care and the overall patient experience.</p>You will love this book if you are a patient in any stage of treatment, are a loved one or caregiver of a patient, work or are interested in working in health-related professions, or are interested in learning how to advocate for yourself in healthcare settings.<br/><br/><i>Tasting YOUR OWN Medicine</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to ordinary adolescents and adults, trained patient advocates, and healthcare professionals who want to look at patient advocacy, empowerment, and support in a new way.<br/> <p><strong>The Book - <i>Tasting YOUR OWN Medicine</i></strong></p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3.

These chapters serve to develop the concept of the curious patient and caregiver, emphasizing the qualities and approaches that are applied to healthcare, such as viewing medicine as a team sport rather than a one-sided discussion, while also exploring the importance of emotional literacy from both the personal and professional perspectives. <br/><br/>Part 3 contains chapters 7-9.

According to his friends, you may also recognize him as the sole person sprinting across parts of campus minutes before his next class or meeting.  For more information, you can connect with Karan at karan.mirpuri@vanderbilt.edu and at @karan.mirpuri (Instagram). Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier. The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship. Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:Please share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #[TastingYOUROWNMedicine] and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so that we can help amplify your efforts.
You can easily share my pre-sale campaign via Indiegogo at the top of the page.
Please share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it via text or direct message on social media.
Thank you so much for of all of your love and support!Thanks again,Karan Mirpuri",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p>Maya Cameron-Gordon is a mom and former teacher based in Oakland, CA. Recognizing the lack of diversity in children's books, her dream in creating <i>The Mermaid Princesses</i> was to increase representation in stories for young readers.</p>
<p>Maya remembers people casting a lot of shame around having African heritage when she was growing up. Having a 6-year-old daughter, (to whom the book is dedicated) Maya wants to be a part of changing that narrative of shame toward one of self-love, pride and readers feeling like they can do anything. For kids outside of the African-American experience, she wants them to have a healthy exposure to characters from diverse backgrounds that they admire and want to be like.</p>
<p>Being that there are only so many ""seats at the table"" for creators of color in the publishing industry, this campaign aim is to help show people are willing to support diverse artists and diverse stories via fiscal contribution. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</h3>
<p>This $10K will help us produce the books and other items at a healthy enough volume that we can be sustainable and continue to print and share the products in the future.</p>
<p>The money raised will be used in the manner below:</p>
<ul>
<li>70% | Developing + printing the FIRST EDITION PRINT of The Mermaid Princesses</li>
<li>20% | Creating the MERMAID PLUSH TOYS sold in book packages</li>
<li>10% | Producing custom MERMAID NOTEBOOKS sold in the book packages for kids to write their own story ideas after reading the story Maya wrote.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p><strong>THE SAD TRUTH:</strong> According to the Children's Book Diversity Council, less than 10% of children's books in 2018 featured a main character of color. By the numbers, there are 3x as many books published featuring animals in the U.S. than those featuring Black, Latinx, Asian, Native American and African children COMBINED! Let's help to change this. </p>
<p><strong>A LONGSTANDING MYTH </strong>in the publishing world is that people just don't dig into their pockets to support creators of color in a financial way that justifies printing and publishing their works on a large scale.</p>
<p><i>Let's prove them wrong and show that diverse books of all kinds deserve a place on the shelf.</i></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Help us! Even a tiny contribution makes a difference to us. </span><br/></p>
<p>'Graveyards of the Banks'  is a haunting trilogy that tells the inside story of the Most Successful Bank in the Universe from a unique perspective, the story of a forgotten tribe of jobless humanities graduates who abandon all hope and enter the Third Basement of the Building Without A Name for a life on the graveyard shift.  </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The author worked on that night shift herself for seven years in a toxic bubble of bitches and bullies where the Bank conducts human experiments to select the Fittest to Rule.  'I smuggled that story out in my head and my heart', she says.</span><br/></p>
<p>How does it feel when you spend night after night in an iron chair with no toilet breaks and fear of being fired at the end of your shift?  How do you survive the angry bankers, fighting to be noticed by their superiors who groom them for 'leadership'?  Their shouting resembles constant gunfire.  They see themselves as predators, and Nyla is their prey.  But almost all of them will fail.  How do you make it through the next cull, when 20% of the workforce must be eliminated?</p>
<p>How do you live, how do you love? How can you sleep during the day while the Monsters are Arising?</p>
<p>Most of the stories about the world of finance are told in the voice of the bankers.  It is tough for a small voice from the graveyard shift to be heard, but Nyla is daring to raise that voice.  She speaks not just for herself but for many others. <br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Help us get the word out about this book.  We need an investment of at least $1,000 as seed money to start a publicity campaign to get Nyla's voice heard and the story of her forgotten tribe out of the midnight shadows.No one will hear that story unless we get it out.  And getting a story heard is very very difficult.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The author and the publisher have invested in all the creative and administrative tasks: writing and editing the book, creating the covers, layout, videos, blurbs...  What we need now is a publicity campaign  to reach as many people as possible and for that we need funding.</span><br/></p>
<p>All the money raised will go towards our campaign to get this book to the readers. We will conduct a sophisticated and specialised online publicity campaign.  The kind of campaign that works.  But it costs money.  Nyla's entire share of the proceeds of this book will also go into promotion for the first year.  (After investing  5 years of working on the book which she financed from her savings.)<br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Your donation will be rewarded by unique perks - and you will be part of an exciting journey.  You can be as close or as distant to our campaign as you like, and you can of course contribute anonymously.</span><br/></p>
<p>Volume 1: 'I did it for the money' will be published on 6 March 2015 and is already available for pre-order on Amazon. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Graveyards-Banks-Midnights-Successful-Universe-ebook/dp/B00U7HRVNK"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.amazon.com/Graveyards-Banks-Midnight...</a> </p>
<p>Volume 2: 'Monsters Arising' and Volume 3: 'Slaughterhouse Morning' will be out later in 2015.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>In spite of high praise by big name publishers (Nyla was published by a 'Big Five' publisher a few years ago under a different, very secret name), 'Graveyards of the Banks' was considered too controversial for publication.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If you contribute to our venture, you will give a voice to people like Nyla and her former colleagues who know too much and are still invisible.  We promise you will never look at the world of finance quite in the same way again.  You may even change your mind about the meaning of success and happiness.</span><br/></p>
<p>'I did it for the money' is also a great read.  Dark, acerbic humour and deeply felt emotions follow each other as the clock strikes midnight, as night turns to morning, as the dawn rises behind St Paul's.  It will make you laugh, it will make you cry...</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>'Discoverability' is everything in the world of books.  And the only way to get it is through a professional publicity campaign.  This was done very very successfully with one of Nyla's secret books and she knows it works.  But it all depends on the funding.  </p>
<p>The risk is that the book we will not get that funding and that we will therefore not be able to reach enough readers.  But we will do everything we can, whatever the outcome of this campaign. Every penny will be put to good use.  'Graveyards of the Banks' needs to be read.</p>
<ul></ul>

</div> <p><br/></p></div>","Short Summary 100% GOAL REACHED!  THANK YOU FEARLESS FUNDERS.
EVERY PENNY WILL BE SPENT TO THE WORD OUT ABOUT THIS GRASSROOTS STORY FROM THE DARK HEART OF CAPITALISM.
And you can now contribute on IN DEMAND until the end of time.  We will need ongoing support so please don't forget us.  No contribution too large or small. 
Thanks to our fearless supporters we already have some orders for the book.Graveyards of the Banks - I did it for the money) But we need to reach a much much broader audience which is not accessible to a small publisher.  We are competing with the biggest boys on the planet.  Promotion is very very expensive -both in time and in money.  We can't do it all alone.
Help us! Even a tiny contribution makes a difference to us. 
'Graveyards of the Banks'  is a haunting trilogy that tells the inside story of the Most Successful Bank in the Universe from a unique perspective, the story of a forgotten tribe of jobless humanities graduates who abandon all hope and enter the Third Basement of the Building Without A Name for a life on the graveyard shift.  
The author worked on that night shift herself for seven years in a toxic bubble of bitches and bullies where the Bank conducts human experiments to select the Fittest to Rule.  'I smuggled that story out in my head and my heart', she says.
How does it feel when you spend night after night in an iron chair with no toilet breaks and fear of being fired at the end of your shift?  How do you survive the angry bankers, fighting to be noticed by their superiors who groom them for 'leadership'?  Their shouting resembles constant gunfire.  They see themselves as predators, and Nyla is their prey.  But almost all of them will fail.  How do you make it through the next cull, when 20% of the workforce must be eliminated?
How do you live, how do you love? How can you sleep during the day while the Monsters are Arising?
Most of the stories about the world of finance are told in the voice of the bankers.  It is tough for a small voice from the graveyard shift to be heard, but Nyla is daring to raise that voice.  She speaks not just for herself but for many others.    What We Need & What You Get Help us get the word out about this book.  We need an investment of at least $1,000 as seed money to start a publicity campaign to get Nyla's voice heard and the story of her forgotten tribe out of the midnight shadows.No one will hear that story unless we get it out.  And getting a story heard is very very difficult.
The author and the publisher have invested in all the creative and administrative tasks: writing and editing the book, creating the covers, layout, videos, blurbs...  What we need now is a publicity campaign  to reach as many people as possible and for that we need funding.
All the money raised will go towards our campaign to get this book to the readers. We will conduct a sophisticated and specialised online publicity campaign.  The kind of campaign that works.  But it costs money.  Nyla's entire share of the proceeds of this book will also go into promotion for the first year.  (After investing  5 years of working on the book which she financed from her savings.)
Your donation will be rewarded by unique perks - and you will be part of an exciting journey.  You can be as close or as distant to our campaign as you like, and you can of course contribute anonymously.
Volume 1: 'I did it for the money' will be published on 6 March 2015 and is already available for pre-order on Amazon. http://www.amazon.com/Graveyards-Banks-Midnight... 
Volume 2: 'Monsters Arising' and Volume 3: 'Slaughterhouse Morning' will be out later in 2015.

  The Impact In spite of high praise by big name publishers (Nyla was published by a 'Big Five' publisher a few years ago under a different, very secret name), 'Graveyards of the Banks' was considered too controversial for publication.
If you contribute to our venture, you will give a voice to people like Nyla and her former colleagues who know too much and are still invisible.  We promise you will never look at the world of finance quite in the same way again.  You may even change your mind about the meaning of success and happiness.
'I did it for the money' is also a great read.  Dark, acerbic humour and deeply felt emotions follow each other as the clock strikes midnight, as night turns to morning, as the dawn rises behind St Paul's.  It will make you laugh, it will make you cry...

  Risks & Challenges 'Discoverability' is everything in the world of books.  And the only way to get it is through a professional publicity campaign.  This was done very very successfully with one of Nyla's secret books and she knows it works.  But it all depends on the funding.  
The risk is that the book we will not get that funding and that we will therefore not be able to reach enough readers.  But we will do everything we can, whatever the outcome of this campaign. Every penny will be put to good use.  'Graveyards of the Banks' needs to be read.

  Other Ways You Can Help In spite of a contribution ticket starting at $5, some people just can't afford to contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help:
WRITE A REVIEW!  REVIEWS HELP PEOPLE TO BUY THE BOOK! 
One way to help is to buy the book.

If you can place a professional review, please let us know.

If you can help with getting the word out in some other way, again, please let us know.  Share whatever you can on social media and in real life.  It's free to like Nyla's facebook page! https://www.facebook.com/NylaNox

His name is Earl Burgess Jr , He grew up here in Plymouth Mass, went to the school here and graduated here. Got married here, bought his home here, had his 4 children here. On December 10, 2011, He was diagnosed with a very rare type of cancer it is called Mantle Cell Lymphoma. He has already endured 6 months of Chemotherapy and everything that goes along with it. Currently he is getting more treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital and is also going through a Stem Cell Transplant. This particular type of Lymphoma is very aggressive and is highly likely to return. Even if this stem cell transplant works he will still be fighting for his life.<br/> Earl is the kindest most caring person anyone could meet. Like most of us (working class people) he was barely getting by when he was healthy. He was always trying to be positive, as he worked two jobs and struggled to pay their mortgage every month. Being a relatively healthy young man at 47 he did not have health insurance because of the financial expense . He got a sore throat in November of last year. When he didn’t think twice about it due to the fact it was the holiday season and he couldn’t afford to miss any time from work . After all… it was just a sore throat and was nothing to be too concerned about. <br/> Being the bread winner of the family he hasn’t worked since November of 2011. He has been going through his treatments and has applied for disability. This is extremely degrading for him because of his pride and he has never not worked for anything in his life. He is in denial and still in disbelief as we all are. <br/> Getting to the point of this letter, we are in the process of having a fundraiser for him and his family. He is in the process of losing his home at this time, for falling behind on his mortgage since he can not work. Just recently he got a foreclosure notice. They only have one vehicle which is old and very unsafe. This vehicle is the only thing that is able to shuttle him to the hospital, his wife to work and them both home again safely. We would love to raise enough money to pay for his mortgage and get them a safe vehicle. Please make an effort to try and donate to this family in need in any way you can. Anything you can do to help us help him would be greatly appreciated. If you could make it to the fundraiser which will be held on July 21, 2012 at 6pm at the Garibaldi Club in North Plymouth. It is $25.00 per person. If you are unable to make it then please find it in your heart to donate to the website .

He is in denial and still in disbelief as we all are.  Getting to the point of this letter, we are in the process of having a fundraiser for him and his family. He is in the process of losing his home at this time, for falling behind on his mortgage since he can not work. Just recently he got a foreclosure notice. They only have one vehicle which is old and very unsafe. This vehicle is the only thing that is able to shuttle him to the hospital, his wife to work and them both home again safely. We would love to raise enough money to pay for his mortgage and get them a safe vehicle. Please make an effort to try and donate to this family in need in any way you can. Anything you can do to help us help him would be greatly appreciated. If you could make it to the fundraiser which will be held on July 21, 2012 at 6pm at the Garibaldi Club in North Plymouth. It is $25.00 per person. If you are unable to make it then please find it in your heart to donate to the website . The website is www.Indiegogo.com and go to search bar in the upper right hand corner and type in My brother Earl (he is the first picture on the left, created by Cynthia Zaniboni). Thank you from all his family and friends. Your donation are desperately needed and are greatly appreciated . Contributions are not tax deductible. Also all the funds will be sent up in trust account for him.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

It’s all about spotlighting the best independent musicians and innovators and celebrating them. INDIE MAG’s mission is to create a publication that is positive and of value to the global independent music community.</p>
<p><strong>The INDIE MAG Project – Publishing with a conscience.</strong></p>
<p>INDIE MAG has been operating as a passion project for 1 year. We are now on a mission to create a social enterprise that raises funds for the indie music community through the publication of INDIE MAG. <strong>In order to do this, we need to keep INDIE MAG viable. </strong>If you value the kind of platform we are providing for independent musicians all over the world, then we ask that you show your support by making a contribution to this campaign. <strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>How will it work?</strong></p>
<p>We are developing a funding program that gives artists/bands grants to create projects – whether that project is an album, a video, a tour, a music program in India, etc. We want to provide artists with another opportunity to seek financial support simply on the merit of their ideas and their musically-inspired vision for themselves and the world. <strong>Profits generated through sales from the issues will be funneled back into the independent music community. </strong>Throughout this process, we will also be establishing key partnerships to bring even more opportunities to our readers and artists in the community.</p>
<p><strong>Join In</strong></p>
<p>You can join us in making this ideal publishing utopia a reality. Why not just give the funds raised here away? Because by building a stable foundation for the magazine, we will be able to accomplish so much more than what just one campaign can. We will also be able to create a foundation for the project that is self-sustaining. </p>
<p>Talking to artists has shown us that the time is right for this kind of platform. Now, more than ever, indie artists need support and they need tools that can help them get their music and their message out into the world.</p>
<p>Our newest issue is our biggest yet. At this stage, we are maxed out with what we can produce without a budget. But producing the content is only one piece of the puzzle. To make this project work, we also need to be able to enhance our online presentation, put together social networking initiatives and develop a workable grant procedure that can be launched in less than a year.</p>
<p>The funds raised on Indiegogo will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building our website</li>
<li>Designing the issues</li>
<li>Developing the content</li>
<li>Partnership Development</li>
<li>Marketing &amp; Promotional Campaigns</li>
<li>Research &amp; Development</li>
<li>Editorial Consultancy</li>
<li>Development of project grant process</li>
</ul><p><strong>Who have we featured so far?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Every single contribution counts to keep INDIE MAG running!</strong> Please help us spread the word by sharing the link to this page – we appreciate your support in all of its forms! We receive so many emails telling us how much INDIE MAG's presence is appreciated. We appreciate your appreciation:) If you truly value the kind of platform we are providing for independent musicians all over the world, then we ask that you show your support by making a contribution to this campaign. Long live indie!</p></div>","INDIE MAG is a new online and print magazine for independent musicians highlighting scenes, musicians, and music-driven causes from around the world. It’s all about spotlighting the best independent musicians and innovators and celebrating them. INDIE MAG’s mission is to create a publication that is positive and of value to the global independent music community.
The INDIE MAG Project – Publishing with a conscience.
INDIE MAG has been operating as a passion project for 1 year. We are now on a mission to create a social enterprise that raises funds for the indie music community through the publication of INDIE MAG. In order to do this, we need to keep INDIE MAG viable. If you value the kind of platform we are providing for independent musicians all over the world, then we ask that you show your support by making a contribution to this campaign. 
How will it work?
We are developing a funding program that gives artists/bands grants to create projects – whether that project is an album, a video, a tour, a music program in India, etc. We want to provide artists with another opportunity to seek financial support simply on the merit of their ideas and their musically-inspired vision for themselves and the world. Profits generated through sales from the issues will be funneled back into the independent music community. Throughout this process, we will also be establishing key partnerships to bring even more opportunities to our readers and artists in the community.
Join In
You can join us in making this ideal publishing utopia a reality. Why not just give the funds raised here away? Because by building a stable foundation for the magazine, we will be able to accomplish so much more than what just one campaign can. We will also be able to create a foundation for the project that is self-sustaining. 
Talking to artists has shown us that the time is right for this kind of platform. Now, more than ever, indie artists need support and they need tools that can help them get their music and their message out into the world.
Our newest issue is our biggest yet. At this stage, we are maxed out with what we can produce without a budget. But producing the content is only one piece of the puzzle. To make this project work, we also need to be able to enhance our online presentation, put together social networking initiatives and develop a workable grant procedure that can be launched in less than a year.
The funds raised on Indiegogo will go towards:

Building our website
Designing the issues
Developing the content
Partnership Development
Marketing & Promotional Campaigns
Research & Development
Editorial Consultancy
Development of project grant process

<p>Recreational sailing / boating is such a special blessing we humans get to bestow upon ourselves.  Millions of people take to the water in all forms of craft as often as they can, in all kinds of weather conditions, because they enjoy it so much. </p>
<p>But do they accord proper appreciation of the trusty vessels that give them such joy – their cherished boats?  Memories will fade over time, so it is essential to organise and preserve the details of stewardship and enjoyment of a boat. One day it will pass into other hands, but if a well-crafted book remains, owners and following generations will always be able to enjoy their published legacy. </p>
<p><strong>So BoatBio is really all about extending the involvement, pleasure, and enjoyment of a boat's life, and most importantly, the memories.</strong></p>

<h3>Introduction. </h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">                     <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571220091/pkiioiugj9bk8lhgumwq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Nearly ten years ago I had an idea for a sci-fi/fantasy adventure story. It would tell how two young brothers, along with their tutor and uncle, get sucked into a timecrack (a type of wormhole) and travel through time and space into another universe. This begins the search for their missing parents who were also taken by a timecrack.</p>
<p>A short run of the book was published and tested in the UK and Ireland under the title <i>Timecrack</i>, with a plan to follow with a series: <i>The Timecrack Adventures.</i></p>
<p>The result, mainly through my own efforts in the UK and Ireland, saw the book selling successfully to a cross section of readers, including children, young adults and older fans of the genre. The book is now in local libraries, as well as a request by the prestigious <strong>National Library of Ireland in Dublin</strong>, to deposit my books there. See the early reviews.</p>
<p>More recently, the book has been sought by readers in the USA and Overseas. As a result of professional advice at the recent London Book Fair, I decided to use a well-established American publishing and marketing company to introduce a New Edition of <i>Timecrack</i> to meet the requests from these markets. The campaign will be followed by other books in the series.</p>
<p>I have already invested in the UK market, but publishing and marketing in the overseas markets is a very expensive business! However, with Indiegogo’s support and contributors who wish to help, we can meet the demands in these markets.</p>
<p>The new <i>Timecrack </i>print and eBook editions are already in preparation and will be available in late 2019/early 2020. The next two books,<i> Copanatec </i>and <i>V</i><i>arakite</i> will follow in 2020.</p>
<p>I’m fortunate to have a team of friends and associates ready to help. And for those of you who want to support this campaign, there is a choice of PERKS to reward contributors, including the new exclusive <i>Timecrack </i>T-shirt!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>My Background</strong></h3>
<p>I was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, to parents who were profoundly deaf, so it was a silent house I grew up in. There was no radio, and TV was not available then; newspapers, books, and comics for me, were the prime source of entertainment. Outside, although my mother couldn't hear what was being said, the local cinema was a major attraction for both of us. My father was a shipyard painter, and was usually away in some part of the UK working on the big ships.</p>
<p>During my teens, I joined the Air Training Corps (ATC), which became part of a lifetime interest in aviation, space travel and the cosmos. I would read anything on these subjects, as well as early sci-fi and fantasy stories, including works by H. G. Wells - especially, <i>The Time Machine </i>and<i> The War of the Worlds</i>, which really captured my imagination!</p>
<p>I travelled extensively through Canada and America for a couple of years, before returning home to Ireland, where I built up a business supplying companies such as Coca Cola and sports organisations with their promotional advertising goods. Including the 5 Nations Rugby Championship tie, which I created and produced and sold internationally.</p>
<p>A few years later, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. After a period of successful treatment, I was spurred to write about my experience, which, in due course, led to writing short stories. Eventually, it all resulted in exploring a long-held idea I had for writing <i>The Timecrack Adventures.</i></p>
<p>The early reviews of the first short run of<i> Timecrack</i> were very encouraging, but with enquiries coming in from overseas, I soon realised I needed to invest in a proper marketing programme to reach new readers. On a visit to the London Book Fair (a massive event for authors and publishers to meet and discuss the potential of new books) I met with Steven Spatz, the president of BookBaby. The decision was made to pursue and upgrade the New Edition for the international market.</p>
<p>The New Edition of <i>Timecrack </i>will be produced by BookBaby, one of the biggest and most important marketing and self-publishers in America. This edition will be available in late 2019/early 2020, to be followed by the next two books,<i> Copanatec </i>and <i>Varakite</i>, during 2020. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Early Reviews</strong></h3>
<p><strong>A review by</strong> <a href=""http://www.tellest.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>www.tellest.com</strong></a> <strong>the American fantasy website gives an overview of the first adventure:</strong></p>
<p>‘Hey folks!  We’re using some of the momentum from our latest venture into the Otherworld to turn right back around and visit more works of great fiction.  And there’s no better tale than today’s issue to go with the theme.</p>
<p>One of my favorite Michael Crichton properties was <em>Timeline</em>.  And yes, I even loved the movie with Paul Walker and Gerard Butler.  If you’re a fan of the concept of finding ways through time and space, today’s promo is going to be right up your alley.</p>
<p>William Long’s <em>Timecrack</em> is one of those entertaining books that pulls you out of the monotony of day to day life, and thrusts you upon a whole new world.  In this first book in his series, we join the Kinross family in a beautiful, humorous, thrilling adventure when a portal opens and pulls them through to a fantastic, new world.’</p>
<p><em>Timecracks act as portals to other dimensions. They have existed since the creation of time, and when one arrives during a storm at the newly discovered pyramid site in the Yucatan jungle, it’s the beginning of a nightmare journey into another world for archaeologist, Malcolm Kinross and his wife, Lucy. </em></p>
<p><em>And when another timecrack strikes the secretive energy facility in New Mexico, their sons, Archie and Richard, along with their tutor, Marjorie, and their uncle, Professor John Strawbridge, all find themselves thrust into the same world of New Arrivals, ancient warring tribes and deadly enemies.</em></p>
<p><em>Richard is endowed with the ability to ‘see’ beyond his own world. Can he help Archie to find their parents, and help the scientists at Mount Tengi to find a way for all of them to return home, and can he escape the clutches of the mad high priest, Prince Lotane?</em></p>
<p>‘Timecrack is a lovely endeavor by William Long, you’ll be happy to know there are two more in the series, coming soon.  It has characters that are endearing and easy to relate to, and a world that is fully realized with secrets left to be discovered.  If you’re interested in this fun fantasy romp, get your copy today!’</p>
<p><strong>M. McCullough  Daily Mirror</strong>  'William Long's <i>Timecrack</i> is a good old-fashioned science fiction romp in the true spirit of the father of the genre, H. G. Wells. This dizzying Boy's Own escapade through the wormholes of space and time will have you gripped to the last with its fantastical vistas of new exotic worlds and ancient civilisations.'</p>
<p><strong>Karen Maitland  Bestselling Author </strong> 'A Rollercoaster Sci-Fi adventure that flings the reader headlong into other worlds that are all the more unnerving because they blend the fantastic with the familiar. You catch yourself thinking - somewhere in our past or our future this might actually be happening in all of us.'</p>

The result, mainly through my own efforts in the UK and Ireland, saw the book selling successfully to a cross section of readers, including children, young adults and older fans of the genre. The book is now in local libraries, as well as a request by the prestigious National Library of Ireland in Dublin, to deposit my books there. See the early reviews.
More recently, the book has been sought by readers in the USA and Overseas. As a result of professional advice at the recent London Book Fair, I decided to use a well-established American publishing and marketing company to introduce a New Edition of Timecrack to meet the requests from these markets. The campaign will be followed by other books in the series.
I have already invested in the UK market, but publishing and marketing in the overseas markets is a very expensive business! However, with Indiegogo’s support and contributors who wish to help, we can meet the demands in these markets.
The new Timecrack print and eBook editions are already in preparation and will be available in late 2019/early 2020. The next two books, Copanatec and Varakite will follow in 2020.
I’m fortunate to have a team of friends and associates ready to help. And for those of you who want to support this campaign, there is a choice of PERKS to reward contributors, including the new exclusive Timecrack T-shirt!
 
My Background
I was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, to parents who were profoundly deaf, so it was a silent house I grew up in. There was no radio, and TV was not available then; newspapers, books, and comics for me, were the prime source of entertainment. Outside, although my mother couldn't hear what was being said, the local cinema was a major attraction for both of us. My father was a shipyard painter, and was usually away in some part of the UK working on the big ships.
During my teens, I joined the Air Training Corps (ATC), which became part of a lifetime interest in aviation, space travel and the cosmos. I would read anything on these subjects, as well as early sci-fi and fantasy stories, including works by H. G. Wells - especially, The Time Machine and The War of the Worlds, which really captured my imagination!
I travelled extensively through Canada and America for a couple of years, before returning home to Ireland, where I built up a business supplying companies such as Coca Cola and sports organisations with their promotional advertising goods. Including the 5 Nations Rugby Championship tie, which I created and produced and sold internationally.
A few years later, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer. After a period of successful treatment, I was spurred to write about my experience, which, in due course, led to writing short stories. Eventually, it all resulted in exploring a long-held idea I had for writing The Timecrack Adventures.
The early reviews of the first short run of Timecrack were very encouraging, but with enquiries coming in from overseas, I soon realised I needed to invest in a proper marketing programme to reach new readers. On a visit to the London Book Fair (a massive event for authors and publishers to meet and discuss the potential of new books) I met with Steven Spatz, the president of BookBaby. The decision was made to pursue and upgrade the New Edition for the international market.
The New Edition of Timecrack will be produced by BookBaby, one of the biggest and most important marketing and self-publishers in America. This edition will be available in late 2019/early 2020, to be followed by the next two books, Copanatec and Varakite, during 2020. 
 
Early Reviews
A review by www.tellest.com the American fantasy website gives an overview of the first adventure:
‘Hey folks!  We’re using some of the momentum from our latest venture into the Otherworld to turn right back around and visit more works of great fiction.  And there’s no better tale than today’s issue to go with the theme.
One of my favorite Michael Crichton properties was Timeline.  And yes, I even loved the movie with Paul Walker and Gerard Butler.  If you’re a fan of the concept of finding ways through time and space, today’s promo is going to be right up your alley.
William Long’s Timecrack is one of those entertaining books that pulls you out of the monotony of day to day life, and thrusts you upon a whole new world.  In this first book in his series, we join the Kinross family in a beautiful, humorous, thrilling adventure when a portal opens and pulls them through to a fantastic, new world.’
Timecracks act as portals to other dimensions. They have existed since the creation of time, and when one arrives during a storm at the newly discovered pyramid site in the Yucatan jungle, it’s the beginning of a nightmare journey into another world for archaeologist, Malcolm Kinross and his wife, Lucy. 
And when another timecrack strikes the secretive energy facility in New Mexico, their sons, Archie and Richard, along with their tutor, Marjorie, and their uncle, Professor John Strawbridge, all find themselves thrust into the same world of New Arrivals, ancient warring tribes and deadly enemies.
Richard is endowed with the ability to ‘see’ beyond his own world. Can he help Archie to find their parents, and help the scientists at Mount Tengi to find a way for all of them to return home, and can he escape the clutches of the mad high priest, Prince Lotane?
‘Timecrack is a lovely endeavor by William Long, you’ll be happy to know there are two more in the series, coming soon.  It has characters that are endearing and easy to relate to, and a world that is fully realized with secrets left to be discovered.  If you’re interested in this fun fantasy romp, get your copy today!’
M. McCullough  Daily Mirror  'William Long's Timecrack is a good old-fashioned science fiction romp in the true spirit of the father of the genre, H. G. Wells. This dizzying Boy's Own escapade through the wormholes of space and time will have you gripped to the last with its fantastical vistas of new exotic worlds and ancient civilisations.'
Karen Maitland  Bestselling Author  'A Rollercoaster Sci-Fi adventure that flings the reader headlong into other worlds that are all the more unnerving because they blend the fantastic with the familiar. You catch yourself thinking - somewhere in our past or our future this might actually be happening in all of us.'

Everyone who does contribute will have the option of choosing one of the Perks, including the exclusive T-shirt which is already proving to be a winner! There is also the option of a personally signed copy of the New Edition of Timecrack. Due to cost and time constraints, this Perk is limited to 50 copies only, which involves shipping to me for signing and then shipping again to the contributor.
This is an exciting time for the campaign, and if you have read this far, I would like to thank you for taking a look at what we are trying to achieve here.

<p>Visions of the past, an antique journal and a forgotten girl may not be the only barriers between Adelaide Anson and the truth about her parents’ deaths.<br/><br/><i>Fractured Past</i> is the second book in the <i>Crimson Time</i> series that combines elements of history and time travel to creatively engage readers with the past and the women in it.<br/><br/>My name is Emily VanderBent, and I am the author of <i>Fractured Past</i>. I wrote this book because I believe in the power of words to create change, preserve the past and promote healing. We are all a sum of a million different stories. The <i>Crimson Time</i> series as a whole is my way of giving voice to women in the past, creatively sharing some of my own story and encouraging women today to own the narrative of their individual stories.<br/><br/>In reading this book, I hope you will discover the truths only fiction can speak. I hope you come to appreciate the past and find the courage to embrace your own story; every beautiful, horrible, lovely, wretched part of it.<br/><br/>Picking up where <i>Crimson Time</i> left off, <i>Fractured Past</i> follows Adelaide as she delves deeper into the world of the Red Rose Society, a secret order composed of the descendants of historical figures. The deeper she gets, the further away the truth about her parents’ deaths and the night of the fire seems to slip. With the help of her fellow Kindred, some figures from the past and her new found ability to see fragments of history in objects and places, Adelaide just might gain the answers she seeks. And some she never asked for.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you enjoy stories involving time travel, altered history, secret societies and women in the past. Fans of TV shows like <i>Timeless</i>, <i>Reign</i> and <i>Outlander</i>; or people who enjoy reading series in which each book builds on top of the next will also be swept up in the world of <i>Fractured Past</i>.<br/><br/><i>Fractured Past</i> speaks to young adults and the young at heart who want to grapple with remembrance and history in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope <i>Fractured Past</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
</div><div>

<li>Why is it important to remember our collective and individual past?</li>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p><strong>The Story of My Book</strong></p><p><br/>Perfectionism comes with an aura of greatness, of genius, of specificity. We associate perfectionism with Oscar-winning directors whose meticulous details make their work exceptional. We connect it with self-made millionaires who worked ninety hour weeks to support their families. We see it in the valedictorian that knew the answers we didn’t. Seeing these perfectionists succeed reminds us of how imperfect we personally are and everything we need to improve.<br/><br/>This is not perfectionism. Perfectionism doesn’t create success. It creates vulnerabilities to anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and suicidal ideation. It creates a negative loop of constant dissatisfaction. It distorts reality.<br/><br/>Maybe it starts with noticing something about someone else: an impressive job title, a clever sense of humor, a sparkling white smile. Perfectionism magnifies qualities as essential markers of success, of self-worth. The perfectionist constructs life around this funhouse mirror—this distorted image that if they don't meet these arbitrary markers, they lack worth. So they work harder in hope of achieving enough recognition to validate their worth. But because perfectionists see themselves in comparison to others, they can never quite feel satisfied in their own accomplishments.<br/><br/>I’m Chloe Cullen, and I’m a perfectionist. My book <strong><i>Perf: The Unspoken Flaws in a Perfect Culture</i></strong> explores the perfectionist’s unrelenting quest to do, have, and be the best. The book also reflects on how perfectionism appears in cultural and mainstream ideas like The American Dream or self-described perfectionists such as Gordon Ramsay and Martha Stewart as well as socioeconomic institutions such as education and market-based economies.<br/><br/>Through interviews, research, and storytelling, you will meet:</p><ul>
<li>Megan Tan, who made the podcast Millennial at 24 years old documenting her post-grad perfectionism in 2015</li>
<li>Delanie Fischer, who co-hosts the podcast Self-Helpless and re-evaluated her life after experiencing burnout</li>
<li>Thomas Curran, who studies how institutions influence perfectionism on British, Canadian, and American citizens</li>
</ul><p><br/>I hope this book will provide a tool to help understand perfectionism in our everyday world and learn how perfectionism impacts our lives through my personal examples.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you balance a passion project outside of your full-time job, listen to the Hamilton soundtrack, read <i>Big Magic </i>or <i>Untamed </i>or <i>Trick Mirror</i> in the last year, feel that you’re “not doing enough” in the pandemic, follow every and any rule (including rules that you assume other people want you to do), or wonder whether your life is caught in a cookie cutter mold.<br/><br/> </p><p><strong>The Book - <i>Perf</i></strong></p><p><br/><strong><i>Perf </i></strong>is a nonfiction book, written in three parts.<br/><br/><u>Part 1: </u>This section includes an introduction and chapters on Hamilton and the American Dream and Billie Eilish and the paradox of a pop star. There is also a quiz to determine whether you are a perfectionist and a chapter identifying perfectionism’s roots in paralyzing fear and burnout.<br/><br/><u>Part 2:</u> In this section, we’ll track perfectionism through the mainstream and examine its impact on an individual scale (i.e. self-care practices, New York City lifestyles, creativity self-help books, and cooking). For example, one chapter looks at the TV show Hell’s Kitchen hosted by Gordon Ramsay (a self-proclaimed perfectionist) and explores how the reality competition encourages heckling for contestants who make mistakes and ultimately other people who appear less than perfect.<br/><br/><u>Part 3: </u>This last part pivots away from cultural analysis into my own journey with perfectionism, including the institutions that have impacted me (e.g. my all-girls high school environment, familial roles). It includes a somewhat meta look into the process of unpacking my perfectionism while writing this book.<br/><br/> </p><p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p><p><i><strong>Perf</strong> </i>will be published with New Degree Press. To help cover the costs for publishing my book, I’ve set up pre-order tiers. Money raised will go towards the following:</p><ul>
<li>The editor who’ll help me revise and publish my manuscript in August, 2021.</li>
<li>The cover designer who’ll replace this mock placeholder with a professional, custom cover design.</li>
<li>The layout editor who’ll put together the interior of my book and create my ebook.</li>
<li>The copy editor and proof reader who’ll polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The launch &amp; promotion efforts when I publish this summer.</li>

We associate perfectionism with Oscar-winning directors whose meticulous details make their work exceptional. We connect it with self-made millionaires who worked ninety hour weeks to support their families. We see it in the valedictorian that knew the answers we didn’t. Seeing these perfectionists succeed reminds us of how imperfect we personally are and everything we need to improve.This is not perfectionism. Perfectionism doesn’t create success. It creates vulnerabilities to anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and suicidal ideation. It creates a negative loop of constant dissatisfaction. It distorts reality.Maybe it starts with noticing something about someone else: an impressive job title, a clever sense of humor, a sparkling white smile. Perfectionism magnifies qualities as essential markers of success, of self-worth. The perfectionist constructs life around this funhouse mirror—this distorted image that if they don't meet these arbitrary markers, they lack worth. So they work harder in hope of achieving enough recognition to validate their worth. But because perfectionists see themselves in comparison to others, they can never quite feel satisfied in their own accomplishments.I’m Chloe Cullen, and I’m a perfectionist. My book Perf: The Unspoken Flaws in a Perfect Culture explores the perfectionist’s unrelenting quest to do, have, and be the best. The book also reflects on how perfectionism appears in cultural and mainstream ideas like The American Dream or self-described perfectionists such as Gordon Ramsay and Martha Stewart as well as socioeconomic institutions such as education and market-based economies.Through interviews, research, and storytelling, you will meet:
Megan Tan, who made the podcast Millennial at 24 years old documenting her post-grad perfectionism in 2015
Delanie Fischer, who co-hosts the podcast Self-Helpless and re-evaluated her life after experiencing burnout
Thomas Curran, who studies how institutions influence perfectionism on British, Canadian, and American citizens
I hope this book will provide a tool to help understand perfectionism in our everyday world and learn how perfectionism impacts our lives through my personal examples.You will love this book if you balance a passion project outside of your full-time job, listen to the Hamilton soundtrack, read Big Magic or Untamed or Trick Mirror in the last year, feel that you’re “not doing enough” in the pandemic, follow every and any rule (including rules that you assume other people want you to do), or wonder whether your life is caught in a cookie cutter mold. The Book - PerfPerf is a nonfiction book, written in three parts.Part 1: This section includes an introduction and chapters on Hamilton and the American Dream and Billie Eilish and the paradox of a pop star. There is also a quiz to determine whether you are a perfectionist and a chapter identifying perfectionism’s roots in paralyzing fear and burnout.Part 2: In this section, we’ll track perfectionism through the mainstream and examine its impact on an individual scale (i.e. self-care practices, New York City lifestyles, creativity self-help books, and cooking). For example, one chapter looks at the TV show Hell’s Kitchen hosted by Gordon Ramsay (a self-proclaimed perfectionist) and explores how the reality competition encourages heckling for contestants who make mistakes and ultimately other people who appear less than perfect.Part 3: This last part pivots away from cultural analysis into my own journey with perfectionism, including the institutions that have impacted me (e.g. my all-girls high school environment, familial roles). It includes a somewhat meta look into the process of unpacking my perfectionism while writing this book. What I Need & What You'll GetPerf will be published with New Degree Press. To help cover the costs for publishing my book, I’ve set up pre-order tiers. Money raised will go towards the following:
The editor who’ll help me revise and publish my manuscript in August, 2021.
The cover designer who’ll replace this mock placeholder with a professional, custom cover design.
The layout editor who’ll put together the interior of my book and create my ebook.
The copy editor and proof reader who’ll polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
The launch & promotion efforts when I publish this summer.
When I reach 120 campaign backers, I will publish my book in paperback and ebook formats. When 150 people back my campaign, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When my campaign reaches 200 backers, I will bring these stories to life in an audiobook.As a campaign backer, you’re not buying a copy of a book. You're investing in an opportunity to ride shotgun on my path to publishing. Pre-order my book now to receive an exclusive VIP experience, including:

<h2>The Story </h2>
<p>Over the years, I have played with the idea of writing a book.  In April 2012, I decided it was time.  My normal work as an Occupational Therapy Assistant had slowed down significantly. I got so much enjoyment out of creating this book.  Without a doubt, it has been, and continues to be a wonderful adventure!  I had no idea that it would involve as much as it has.  During this time, I have closed chapters of my life, created new relationships, learned how use a computer beyond just surfing the web or checking my email.  I realized how much I like photography.  Speaking in front of more than 3 people has never been fun for me.  However, sharing the book with students in their classrooms has given me a chance to decide I want to do more of it!  I have been touched by the ongoing magic of people wanting to share in the excitement and passion of something I believe in.  Writing the book seemed to be the easiest part so far. I have had great opportunities to meet people and share the experiences and unfolding of The ABC's of Self. </p>
<p>My inspiration comes from the ongoing journey I have been on. This book is my way of continuing to offer ways for people to feel good and connect with that special part of themselves that we all have.</p>
<p>Last summer I believed I could make it to the top of Mt. Rainier and I did. I believe that I will get my book printed! All of the money that is raised will go to printing the book and anything beyond the $15,000, which is the cost of the first order, will go to  promoting the book.  I LOVE the idea of visiting as many places as possible to share the book.  I would be happy and honored to visit classrooms, shelters, nursing homes, hospitals, and more!</p>
<p>I imagine a genuine sense of self is a good thing for all! We all have many areas of life we show up to and daily situations we encounter.  How would the average day in school change if children were showing up with a strong sense of self?  Or, if anyone for that matter, was showing up in all the areas of their life with a sense of connectedness to themselves? </p>
<p>Thanks to all the people that make great things possible!!!</p>

The Story 
Over the years, I have played with the idea of writing a book.  In April 2012, I decided it was time.  My normal work as an Occupational Therapy Assistant had slowed down significantly. I got so much enjoyment out of creating this book.  Without a doubt, it has been, and continues to be a wonderful adventure!  I had no idea that it would involve as much as it has.  During this time, I have closed chapters of my life, created new relationships, learned how use a computer beyond just surfing the web or checking my email.  I realized how much I like photography.  Speaking in front of more than 3 people has never been fun for me.  However, sharing the book with students in their classrooms has given me a chance to decide I want to do more of it!  I have been touched by the ongoing magic of people wanting to share in the excitement and passion of something I believe in.  Writing the book seemed to be the easiest part so far. I have had great opportunities to meet people and share the experiences and unfolding of The ABC's of Self. 
My inspiration comes from the ongoing journey I have been on. This book is my way of continuing to offer ways for people to feel good and connect with that special part of themselves that we all have.

<p>                     -- A Documentary Photo + Oral History Project</p>
<p class=""p0"" style=""text-align: left; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>Thirty-seven years after his death, Chairman Mao is still watching over the nation he once ruled. <br/>This documentary photography project tells stories of rural families who hung Mao’s portrait on their wall alongside pictures of their ancestors, of Buddha and local goddesses, and of bikini girls. Documenting oral history of the family’s experiences under Mao’s rule as well as those of today, the photographer explores the historical, political, economic and social rationales that have kept the late chairman on the wall watching the family’s private space 24/7.  By capturing and examining the rich texture of rural life in early 21st century China interwoven with ideologies, beliefs and expectations beyond stereotypes of the mainstream media representations, the project shall offer its viewers a rare perspective from which they can make their own observations, interpretations and appreciations.</p>

<p class=""p0"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""> </p>
<p class=""p0"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""><strong>Why Mao Zedong On The Wall?</strong><br/>Hailed as the founding father of a “New China”, Late Chairman Mao Zedong once ruled a quarter of the world's population and played a defining role in late 20th century world politics.</p>
<p>To some, he was the revered savior of the nation; to many others, Mao represented the regime who brought famine and persecution and thus countless grievances to the nation, most of which cases are still yet to be disclosed.</p>
<p>An icon for the regime, Mao’s portrait has for decades been hung on Tiananmen, or the Gate of Heavenly Peace, at the heart of the city of Beijing. During the decades under Mao’s rule, almost all Chinese families had to hang his picture in their office and home in order to announce their loyalty to the paramount leader. Thus “the big brother” was watching everyone in every household and there was no escape from it.</p>
<p>Today, hanging Mao’s portrait on the wall is no longer conformity out of political pressure, but rather a personal preference and voluntary choice of the family. And different from what was like during and before the Cultural Revolution, when traditional beliefs, religions and “Capitalist lifestyles” were suppressed, the walls of the household today set a stage for much more than just political images – they are now occupied by posters or pictures of bikini girls on the beach, Hong Kong film stars, local gods and goddesses, Buddha and Bodhisattvas, ancestors, as well as their own snapshots. The imagery on a rural wall has thus mirrors the ideologies that play a role in the family’s life. They interact with one another in the household and create a surreal space where Maoism, Capitalist consumerism, ancestral veneration, local god worship, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism “coexist” peacefully.</p>
<p>Just as the imagery in the private rural space is a slice of the Chinese life of early 21st century, the fact that Mao remains with the household reveals the way the rural family relates to its past, present and future. Often occupying the central spot of the wall, Mao’s image speaks for what the family chooses to remember about the past, and perhaps more significantly, what it wishes the present had.</p>

<p>I spent four and half years in school and then the Culture Revolution began. The Party stopped schooling and sent us young people to the countryside for reeducation. In the 1970s, I was part of the labor force that built the local Taihe Airport. I was earning a dozen or so “labor credits” a day.</p>
<p>There was this night when we were all watching a show in the Hall of the Peasant Workers. The soldiers were sitting at the front rows. Suddenly there was a chaos and I thought it was starting to rain. Everybody got on their feet and started to run. The officials took out their guns and started to shoot. Some people fell down and a stampede started…. A couple of days later, each of the survivors was asked to fill out a form and was told to keep an eye on class enemies.</p>
<p>I had three opportunities to join the Party but I declined because I was not interested in becoming an official.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0Fe39arMSds/UYrggVvQ-II/AAAAAAAAACs/E946lxsD0rY/w600-h400-no/n2+%25282%2529.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""mao-3""/></p>
<p>A man will be judged three times – by law when he is alive, by History when he is dead and also by Hell. Man should do good deeds whenever he can, help others, serve humanity and give more. I was once a Christian, and had joined services. Once an old man told me that I was not supposed to cry when my parents died…. Chairman Mao told us that Failure is the mother of Success. A lot of what he said is valid regardless of time. Mao had a great influence on my life and that influence is not going to go away.</p>
<p>The world is still what it has always been – there are the rich and the poor. It is better off now in the sense that you make more money if you are more capable. In the old days, the more capable earned the same amount as those who were less so…. Mao said China was on its way to Socialism, yet then Deng said that we were only at the primary stage of Socialism. And he said “If a good cat catches mice, should it bother me if it is white or black?” Nowadays, making money is all that matters, regardless of the cost.</p>
<p>Above is part of the story of a 52-year-old rural man who lives in rural Jiangxi, China.</p>
<p>Everyone who has lived through Mao’s era has a story to tell about Mao’s rule. And they all must have a reason to remember. These stories bear invaluable witness to a time about which open discussions are still off limit for ordinary Chinese citizens. They also provide clues to what social changes are necessary from the perspective of the rural population before social tension accumulate to a point of no return. Instead of engaging its views with political arguments, the proposed project shares in-depth insiders’ view on the future of the world’s largest nation, and very likely economy.</p>

<p><strong>Who Am I?</strong><br/>I am a college junior and, for the last two and half years, have been receiving training at IFChina Original Studio, one of China’s pioneer community-based non-profit art organizations focusing on collecting social memories. Since July 2011, I have been photographing rural households with Mao’s portrait(s), documenting their stories and making a feature-length documentary film on a 67-year-old man who is known as the most active marginalized Mao supporter in the region.</p>

<p>Ji’an/Mt. Jinggangshan, the region where IFChina and where my projects are based, is known as the Cradle of Mao’s Revolution. Mao came to this region in Year 1927, started his first guerrilla warfare and went on to change China.</p>
<p class=""p0"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""> </p>
<p><br/><strong>What Do I Want To Do?</strong><br/>A book with photographs and oral history stories of the 100 households in Mt. Jinggangshan region, “Cradle of Mao’s Revolution”. In order to keep the book within a manageable size, I will present 20 of the 100 families with greater length and details than the rest.</p>
<p class=""p0"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""> </p>
<p>I will need six months to reach my goal for shooting (100 families, out of which 20 will be featured) and another six months to edit the photos, oral history stories and my journals into a complete photo book. My selection of the 100 households will be based on considerations of diversity in gender, age, ethnicity, education background, and financial status.</p>

<p><strong>What Else Can It Bring To The World?</strong><br/>According to some, China is the nation that will change the world in the 21st century. Well, perhaps, for better or worse. But there is no doubt that understanding this nation helps us make better sense of the world we are living in.</p>
<p class=""p0"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""> </p>
<p>I hope my proposed book will be one of the most candid photo books on modern history and present development. It will, of course, not be the most comprehensive book on Mao, but I believe it will be a most revealing one that will help its readers understand China through the pains and hopes of its “rank-and-file” citizens who are closest to the soil – the Chinese farmers.</p>
<p class=""p0"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""> </p>
<p><br/><strong>What I Need?</strong><br/>I will be graduating from college in July, 2014. Having been quite a lot of work on this project in rural Jiangxi for almost three years now, I need your strong support to help me complete the last two stages of my project – in-depth documentation of the 20 households and production of the photo book. This project will have taken 3.5 years of my life – that’s a lot of time out of my four years in college! And with 100 households, you can be sure that there are a lot of stories to transcribe, photos to edit, and journals to work on.</p>
<p class=""p0"" style=""margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;""> </p>
<p>During my interviews, I have heard met many kind-hearted families and heard their stories. And I believe these stories are worth being told to many others around the world.</p>

                     -- A Documentary Photo + Oral History Project
IntroductionThirty-seven years after his death, Chairman Mao is still watching over the nation he once ruled. This documentary photography project tells stories of rural families who hung Mao’s portrait on their wall alongside pictures of their ancestors, of Buddha and local goddesses, and of bikini girls. Documenting oral history of the family’s experiences under Mao’s rule as well as those of today, the photographer explores the historical, political, economic and social rationales that have kept the late chairman on the wall watching the family’s private space 24/7.  By capturing and examining the rich texture of rural life in early 21st century China interwoven with ideologies, beliefs and expectations beyond stereotypes of the mainstream media representations, the project shall offer its viewers a rare perspective from which they can make their own observations, interpretations and appreciations.
   
 
Why Mao Zedong On The Wall?Hailed as the founding father of a “New China”, Late Chairman Mao Zedong once ruled a quarter of the world's population and played a defining role in late 20th century world politics.
To some, he was the revered savior of the nation; to many others, Mao represented the regime who brought famine and persecution and thus countless grievances to the nation, most of which cases are still yet to be disclosed.
An icon for the regime, Mao’s portrait has for decades been hung on Tiananmen, or the Gate of Heavenly Peace, at the heart of the city of Beijing. During the decades under Mao’s rule, almost all Chinese families had to hang his picture in their office and home in order to announce their loyalty to the paramount leader. Thus “the big brother” was watching everyone in every household and there was no escape from it.
Today, hanging Mao’s portrait on the wall is no longer conformity out of political pressure, but rather a personal preference and voluntary choice of the family. And different from what was like during and before the Cultural Revolution, when traditional beliefs, religions and “Capitalist lifestyles” were suppressed, the walls of the household today set a stage for much more than just political images – they are now occupied by posters or pictures of bikini girls on the beach, Hong Kong film stars, local gods and goddesses, Buddha and Bodhisattvas, ancestors, as well as their own snapshots. The imagery on a rural wall has thus mirrors the ideologies that play a role in the family’s life. They interact with one another in the household and create a surreal space where Maoism, Capitalist consumerism, ancestral veneration, local god worship, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism “coexist” peacefully.
Just as the imagery in the private rural space is a slice of the Chinese life of early 21st century, the fact that Mao remains with the household reveals the way the rural family relates to its past, present and future. Often occupying the central spot of the wall, Mao’s image speaks for what the family chooses to remember about the past, and perhaps more significantly, what it wishes the present had.
 
 
 
And So The Story Goes…
I spent four and half years in school and then the Culture Revolution began. The Party stopped schooling and sent us young people to the countryside for reeducation. In the 1970s, I was part of the labor force that built the local Taihe Airport. I was earning a dozen or so “labor credits” a day.
There was this night when we were all watching a show in the Hall of the Peasant Workers. The soldiers were sitting at the front rows. Suddenly there was a chaos and I thought it was starting to rain. Everybody got on their feet and started to run. The officials took out their guns and started to shoot. Some people fell down and a stampede started…. A couple of days later, each of the survivors was asked to fill out a form and was told to keep an eye on class enemies.
I had three opportunities to join the Party but I declined because I was not interested in becoming an official.

A man will be judged three times – by law when he is alive, by History when he is dead and also by Hell. Man should do good deeds whenever he can, help others, serve humanity and give more. I was once a Christian, and had joined services. Once an old man told me that I was not supposed to cry when my parents died…. Chairman Mao told us that Failure is the mother of Success. A lot of what he said is valid regardless of time. Mao had a great influence on my life and that influence is not going to go away.
The world is still what it has always been – there are the rich and the poor. It is better off now in the sense that you make more money if you are more capable. In the old days, the more capable earned the same amount as those who were less so…. Mao said China was on its way to Socialism, yet then Deng said that we were only at the primary stage of Socialism. And he said “If a good cat catches mice, should it bother me if it is white or black?” Nowadays, making money is all that matters, regardless of the cost.
Above is part of the story of a 52-year-old rural man who lives in rural Jiangxi, China.
Everyone who has lived through Mao’s era has a story to tell about Mao’s rule. And they all must have a reason to remember. These stories bear invaluable witness to a time about which open discussions are still off limit for ordinary Chinese citizens. They also provide clues to what social changes are necessary from the perspective of the rural population before social tension accumulate to a point of no return. Instead of engaging its views with political arguments, the proposed project shares in-depth insiders’ view on the future of the world’s largest nation, and very likely economy.
 
 
 
Who Am I?I am a college junior and, for the last two and half years, have been receiving training at IFChina Original Studio, one of China’s pioneer community-based non-profit art organizations focusing on collecting social memories. Since July 2011, I have been photographing rural households with Mao’s portrait(s), documenting their stories and making a feature-length documentary film on a 67-year-old man who is known as the most active marginalized Mao supporter in the region.
 
Ji’an/Mt. Jinggangshan, the region where IFChina and where my projects are based, is known as the Cradle of Mao’s Revolution. Mao came to this region in Year 1927, started his first guerrilla warfare and went on to change China.
 
What Do I Want To Do?A book with photographs and oral history stories of the 100 households in Mt. Jinggangshan region, “Cradle of Mao’s Revolution”. In order to keep the book within a manageable size, I will present 20 of the 100 families with greater length and details than the rest.
 
I will need six months to reach my goal for shooting (100 families, out of which 20 will be featured) and another six months to edit the photos, oral history stories and my journals into a complete photo book. My selection of the 100 households will be based on considerations of diversity in gender, age, ethnicity, education background, and financial status.
 
 
 
 
What Else Can It Bring To The World?According to some, China is the nation that will change the world in the 21st century. Well, perhaps, for better or worse. But there is no doubt that understanding this nation helps us make better sense of the world we are living in.
 
I hope my proposed book will be one of the most candid photo books on modern history and present development. It will, of course, not be the most comprehensive book on Mao, but I believe it will be a most revealing one that will help its readers understand China through the pains and hopes of its “rank-and-file” citizens who are closest to the soil – the Chinese farmers.
 
What I Need?I will be graduating from college in July, 2014. Having been quite a lot of work on this project in rural Jiangxi for almost three years now, I need your strong support to help me complete the last two stages of my project – in-depth documentation of the 20 households and production of the photo book. This project will have taken 3.5 years of my life – that’s a lot of time out of my four years in college! And with 100 households, you can be sure that there are a lot of stories to transcribe, photos to edit, and journals to work on.
 
During my interviews, I have heard met many kind-hearted families and heard their stories. And I believe these stories are worth being told to many others around the world.
 
So here I am raising funds for Chairman Mao on the Wall.

</div></div>","We the Kings singer/songwriter Travis Clark was recently inspired to write a different kind of verse. After reading his sister Tara's children's book, ""Fussy Pants"" -- based on her son, Chase -- he wrote his own book dedicated to his nephew. 


Travis' ""The Lion & The Love"" is (you guessed it) a love story about a lion who almost loses his true love but does whatever it takes to get her back!  Follow the Lion King Travis through his journey to find his one true love. 




Tara's ""Fussy Pants"" is the tale of a new (exhausted) mom who tries anything and everything to get her baby to stop crying. Not only is it a story all parents and babysitters can relate to, there are bonus WTK images to find throughout the book.


If you have kids, these will be fantastic additions to their libraries! If not, the sibling-duo's books are great as keepsakes or gifts.  We CAN'T promise that you won't say ""awwwww"" at the end of each book, but we CAN guarantee that you will want to read these stories over and over again :)




If all goes well, you can expect both books completed and at your door in November 2014!!!  We just need help with funding to get them printed, packaged and placed on your doorstep.

<p></p><h3>Short Summary</h3><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>Life seems to be hard for many people. However, it doesn’t
have to be that way.</p>
<p>Actually, life isn’t supposed to be hard. It is supposed to
be fun, effortless and joyous!</p>
<p>That’s what I discovered after having my own share of
worries, fears and even a burnout.</p>
<p>Since the world can use more light, I’m sharing my
insights, experiences and even my own fears (and how I dealt with them) in a new book: “Life is a Game!”</p>
<p>To be able to reach more people and create a website with
free resources and a directory of coaches, therapists, healers and facilitators, free for both the ones providing support and the ones seeking it, I
welcome your support.</p>
<p>On this page you will read more about my background, what
the book (and the rest of the project) is about, what the project still requires and which bargains you can do ☺.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p></p><h3>My Background</h3><p></p>
<p>My name is Jan Vermeiren. You might know me of the books
“Let’s Connect!” and “How to REALLY use LinkedIn!”, but chances are that you have never heard of me at all ☺.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allow me to share a bit more about myself and the project.</p>
<p>If you have read “Let’s Connect!” or “How to REALLY use
LinkedIn” you will have experienced that all the online and offline networking
tips I shared were based upon a solid foundation: fundamental,
universal or spiritual laws. They are the base to build further upon.
Without them all the practical tips would only be beneficial for a small fraction
of their potential.
This applies not only to networking, but to all other areas of life as
well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been a student of how these laws work for over 12
years. However, only a few years ago, I really started to grasp what I now call
the “Game of Life”. I also began to understand why my results were inconsistent
before (from creating a best seller to almost bankruptcy).</p>
<p>In the ""darker days"" I even had a kind of burnout. I explicitly write ""a kind of burnout"" since I was too busy noticing it ☺.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As with many people with a burnout these events invited me to look deeper. As a result I discovered a few other layers in life (I call them phases in the book). And suddenly everything began to make sense. I realized that Life IS a Game. When looking at Life from this point of view, it doesn’t only get easier to understand and to play it, but it also becomes much lighter and much more joyful!</p><p>I also discovered that monsters, trains, teddy bears, GPS systems and even computer games are great analogies to explain the more complex universal laws. When I started using them I saw people immediately grasp what it was all about. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/996178/files/20141108045749-LIAG_grot_strip_001_small.jpg?1415451469"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>So it dawned on me how Life REALLY is a game, but the rules and
setup were never communicated or taught. Or rather, they WERE communicated (by
for example religious texts), but most of us didn’t grasp the practical meaning
or implication.</p><p>One of the goals of the book “Life is a Game” is to translate these
sometimes hard to read or understand documents into normal, day-to-day language.
That’s why I’m using a lot of funny and
easy-to-grasp metaphors to clarify what really is going on and how to make changes.</p>
<p><b></b></p><p><br/></p><h3>The Book ""Life is a Game!""</h3><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>The book is about the 3 phases of Life. It gives more
insight into why we sometimes feel that Life is hard and how to change that. It shows that en-light-enment doesn’t mean sitting on a mountain and suddenly
disappear in a bundle of radiating light (although some of you may find that
very cool ☺),
but that it is about living a life in human form that feels light, joyous and
effortless.</p><p>So you could call it a book that translates ""high-in-the-sky"" concepts into ""down-to-earth"", practical tips.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/996188/files/20141108050257-LIAG_GAMEROOM_001.jpg?1415451777"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>To start,  I not only share 10 invitations to start
experiencing a lighter life, but also several “emergency tools” to assist the reader in immediately transforming situations in which they feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once they have experienced more inner peace coming and going,
I share 7 ways on how to sustain that state so they don’t fall back into
situations with lots of turmoil.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we have a solid foundation to start building our dream
life. I’ll share how to attract everything one desires and also why the so-called ""Law of
Attraction"" doesn’t seem to work for many people (and what to do about that).</p>
<p>Last but not least I’ll show 7 keys to a Joyful Life in
harmony with yourself and all other people in your life. </p>
<p>I will also share lots of personal experiences with applying
the tips. Both the fears and emotions that I experienced on the one hand (which is not so common for a man according to a female proofreader ☺) and the joy that I had on the other hand. Since it's a book about living a Joyful Life it has a light tone of voice and contains lots of humor as well!</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p></p><h3>Why Your Support Is Welcome</h3><p></p>
<p>Now that you know what the book is about, let me explain the
status of the project and why I welcome your help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The current status is that I have written the book in
English. Because I’m a native Dutch speaker some editing will need to be done.
A cover needs to be designed and visuals need to be purchased. Those costs are already covered.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/996186/files/20141108050125-LIAG_wickedwarriors_001.jpg?1415451685"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>Why I welcome your support (= for which parts of the project funds are still needed):</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>To reach a larger audience with this positive message the book will be published in <b>two languages</b> (English and Dutch) at the same time. This involves <b>translating,
editing, proofreading and extra visuals</b>. To remain independent, the book will be self-published. This includes upfront paying for the <b>printing</b> and <b>storage space</b> for the books.The <b>press</b> likes review copies so those need to be printed, packaged and sent.</li>
<li>A <b>website for the book will be built in two
languages</b> (to start with) providing <b>extra background information, resources and
exercises</b> regarding the topics of the book. Extra articles, video tips, interviews etc. will be added on a regular basis. This website and all
its resources will be made <b>available for free so everybody can benefit from them whatever their financial situation is</b>.</li>
<li>On top of that, a <b>free worldwide
directory will be created on the website</b> where coaches, healers, therapists and facilitators can create a free
account so readers of the book can find someone in their area for extra support related to tools or methods described in the book or anything else they
need help with. The reason I offer this directory emerged from my own
experience: after reading other books about an interesting method, tool or healing practice
I was unable to find someone close to me who could help me with applying it. My intention for this
directory is that everyone will be able to find a coach, therapist, healer or
facilitator nearby. To lower the barrier for both readers and coaches / facilitators / healers / therapists, this <b>directory</b> will be offered for <b>free</b>.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p></p><h3>How You Can Help</h3><p></p>
<p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Besides buying a perk, you can share this crowd funding campaign with your family, friends, colleagues and other people from your network by <b>emailing</b> them or mentioning it on <b>social media</b> like Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn. There are buttons on top of the page to make this sharing easy for you!</p>
<p>Remark: if you don’t want to or are not able to help now, but want to be informed when the book is finished, you can leave your name and email address on the website <a href=""http://www.life-is-a-game.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.life-is-a-game.org</a></p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>“Why do you use crowd funding for the project?“</li>
<ul>
<li>Traditional publishing takes a year for books to get into bookstores. My gut feeling said this book needed to be birthed sooner. That’s why it’s self-published. This also means that all the normal publishing costs are for me.</li>
<li>Crowd funding is an alternative for asking a bank for a loan. And instead of asking people to donate or loan money, they get something in return. In the case of this campaign it is a book, a playshop, a presentation, … </li>
</ul>
<li>""What if the campaign doesn’t get enough funds? Will I receive the “perk” I ordered or do I lose my money?”</li>
<ul>
<li>The status is that the English book is now in the stage of lay-outing. The Dutch version is in the final stages of editing and proofreading. So you will receive them. The other “perks” will also be available even if the campaign doesn’t raise enough money.</li>
<li>If the campaign doesn’t raise enough money, I will go to the bank or other sources to get extra funding. However, it would be nice not to have to do that ☺.</li>
</ul>
<li>“What is the current status?”</li>
<ul>
<li>Nov 7: English book is now in the stage of lay-outing. The Dutch version is in the final stages of editing and proofreading.</li>
<li>Nov 9: The illustrations of the book are ready. You will find a few of them on this page.</li>
<li>Nov 13: excerpts from the book are added to this page.</li>
</ul>
<li>“Why so many different perks?”</li>
<ul>
<li>Not everybody likes the same thing. So that’s why there is a variety of choices.</li>
</ul>
<li>“I have problems with paying via PayPal or credit card (or don’t have them).“</li>
<ul>
<li>Just send an email to connect@life-is-a-game.org and we will find an alternative solution.</li>

</p><h1>Nederlandse versie</h1>
<p></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Korte Samenvatting</h3><p></p>
<p>
Voor veel mensen lijkt het leven moeilijk. Dit hoeft echter niet zo te zijn.
</p>
<p>
Meer nog, het leven hoort niet moeilijk of lastig te zijn. De bedoeling is dat het leuk, moeiteloos en vreugdevol is!
</p>
<p>
Dat heb ik ontdekt na veel ervaringen van angsten, zorgen en zelfs een burn-out.
</p>
<p>
Aangezien de wereld wat licht en lichtheid kan gebruiken, deel ik mijn inzichten, ervaringen en zelfs mijn eigen angsten (en hoe ik ermee omgegaan ben) in een nieuw boek: ""Life is a Game!""
</p>
<p>
Om meer mensen te kunnen bereiken en een website met gratis informatie en een gids van coaches, therapeuten, helers en facilitators te kunnen aanbieden die gratis is voor zowel hen die hulp bieden als zoeken, is jouw ondersteuning welkom.
</p>
<p>
Op deze pagina lees je meer over mijn achtergrond, waar het boek (en de rest van het project) over gaat, welke delen van het project nog hulp kunnen gebruiken en welke koopjes je kan doen ☺.
</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p><h3>Mijn Achtergrond</h3><p></p>
<p>
Mijn naam is Jan Vermeiren. Je kent me misschien van de boeken “Let’s Connect!” en “Hoe LinkedIn nu ECHT gebruiken”, maar de kans is minstens even groot dat je nog nooit van mij hebt gehoord ☺.
</p>
<p>
Laat me dus iets meer over mezelf en over het project vertellen.
</p>
<p>
Als je ""Let's Connect!"" of ""Hoe LinkedIn nu ECHT gebruiken"" hebt gelezen, dan zal je ervaren hebben dat alle tips m.b.t. online en offline netwerken gebaseerd zijn op een stevige fundering: de fundamentele, universele of spirituele wetten. Ze zijn de basis waarop de tips rusten. Zonder dit fundament zouden de tips slechts een fractie van hun potentieel opleveren. Dit is niet enkel met netwerken zo, maar met alle aspecten van ons leven.
</p>
<p>
Al meer dan 12 jaar ben ik een ""student"" van hoe deze wetten werken. Maar slechts een paar jaar geleden begon ik écht te begrijpen hoe ""The Game of Life"" werkt. Ik begon in te zien waarom mijn resultaten niet consistent waren (van het creëren van bestsellers tot bijna failliet gaan).
</p><p></p><p>In de ""donkere dagen"" had ik zelfs een soort van burnout. Ik schrijf expliciet ""soort van"" aangezien ik het te druk had om deze op te merken ☺.</p><p>Zoals het geval is met zoveel anderen die een burnout hebben, werd ik uitgenodigd om dieper te kijken. Het resultaat was dat ik een aantal extra lagen in het leven ontdekte (ik noem hen fasen in het boek). En plots begon alles veel duidelijker te worden. Ik realiseerde me dat het Leven ECHT een spel is. Wanneer je op die manier naar het leven kan kijken, dan wordt het niet enkel gemakkelijker om het te begrijpen en het te spelen, maar het wordt ook veel lichter en vreugdevoller!</p><p>Ik ontdekte ook dat monsters, treinen, teddyberen, GPS systemen en zelfs computer games fantastische analogieën opleveren om de meer complexe universele wetten uit te leggen. Wanneer ik hen begon te gebruiken, zag ik dat anderen direct oppikten waar het over ging.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/996180/files/20141108045846-LIAG_grot_strip_001_small.jpg?1415451526"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Ik zie nu hoe het Leven ECHT een spel is waarvan de regels en hoe het opgezet is, nooit werden gecommuniceerd. Of liever, ze WERDEN gecommuniceerd (bv. in religieuze teksten), maar de meesten onder ons begrepen niet wat er werkelijk stond of hoe het praktisch toe te passen. </p><p>Eén van de doelen van ""Life is a Game!"", is om deze soms moeilijk lees- of verstaanbare documenten te vertalen naar normale, dagdagelijkse taal. Daarom gebruik ik grappige en gemakkelijk begrijpbare metaforen om te verduidelijken wat er echt aan de hand is en hoe dit te veranderen (als je dat zou willen).
</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p><h3>Het Boek ""Life is a Game!""</h3><p></p>
<p>Het boek gaat over de 3 Levensfasen. Het geeft inzichten in waarom het soms lijkt dat het leven moeilijk is en hoe dat te veranderen. Ik toon dat ver-licht-ing niet betekent hoog op een berg te gaan zitten en plots te verdwijnen in een bundel van stralend licht (hoewel sommige mensen dat heel cool zouden vinden ☺), maar dat het gaat om een leven te leiden in een menselijke vorm dat licht, vreugdevol en moeiteloos is.</p><p>Je zou het dus een boek kunnen noemen dat ""high-in-the-sky"" concepten vertaalt in ""down-to-earth"" praktische tips.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/996189/files/20141108050332-LIAG_GAMEROOM_001.jpg?1415451812"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Om te beginnen deel ik niet enkel 10 uitnodigingen om meer lichtheid in het leven te ervaren, maar ik beschrijf ook een aantal ""emergency tools"" die de lezer onmiddellijk helpen wanneer die zich overweldigd voelt.</p>
<p>Eenmaal dat hij of zij al regelmatig meer innerlijke vrede heeft ervaren, toon ik 7 manieren om die staat van zijn te kunnen behouden zodat hij of zij niet terugvalt in situaties met veel chaos.</p>
<p>Dan is er een solide basis waarop hij of zij zijn/haar droomleven kan bouwen. Ik deel hoe alles aan te trekken wat iemand verlangt en ook waarom de zogenaamde ""Wet van Aantrekking"" niet lijkt te werken voor veel mensen (en wat daaraan te doen).</p><p>Last but not least, toon ik 7 sleutels voor een Joyful Life in harmonie met jezelf en alle andere mensen in je leven.</p><p>Ik deel tevens verschillende persoonlijke voorbeelden van hoe ik de tips heb toegepast. Zowel mijn angsten en emoties (wat volgens een vrouwelijke proeflezer niet gebruikelijk is voor een man ☺) als de successen en de Joy die ik heb mogen ervaren, komen aan bod. Aangezien het boek gaat over een ""Joyful Life"" is de toon van het boek licht en doorspekt met veel (zelf-relativerende) humor.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p><h3>Waarom Jouw Hulp Welkom Is</h3><p></p>
<p>Nu dat je weet waar het boek over gaat, geef ik je de status van het project en deel ik waarom jouw steun welkom is. 
</p>
<p>
Ik heb het boek in het Engels geschreven. Aangezien ik Nederlandstalig ben, moet dit nog ""opgeschoond"" en nagelezen worden. Ook de layout dient voorzien te worden, een cover dient gecreëerd te worden en cartoons dienen getekend te worden. Hierin heb ik zelf al geïnvesteerd, dus dat is al in orde.
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/996184/files/20141108050034-LIAG_wickedwarriors_001.jpg?1415451634"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>Dit dient nog te gebeuren (= voor deze zaken zijn er nog fondsen nodig):</p>
<ul>
<li>Om meer mensen te kunnen bereiken met deze positieve boodschap, wordt het boek op hetzelfde moment in <b>twee talen</b> uitgebracht (Engels en Nederlands). Dat betekent <b>vertalen, redigeren, proeflezen en extra tekeningen</b>. Om het project onafhankelijk te houden, wordt het boek via het self-publishing concept in de wereld gezet. Dit houdt o.a. in: de <b>drukker</b> vooraf betalen en <b>opslagruimte</b> huren voor de boeken. Aangezien de <b>pers</b> graag beoordelingsexemplaren heeft, dienen die gedrukt, verpakt en opgestuurd te worden.</li>
<li>Er zal een <b>website</b> gebouwd worden voor het boek in <b>twee talen</b> (om te beginnen) met extra achtergrond informatie en oefeningen m.b.t. de topics van het boek. Er zullen op regelmatige basis extra artikels, video clips, interviews, enz. toegevoegd worden. Deze website met informatie wordt <b>gratis</b> aangeboden zodat <b>iedereen er toegang toe heeft of ze nu genoeg financiële middelen hebben of niet</b>.
</li>
<li>Op de website zal ook een <b>wereldwijde gratis gids</b> voorzien worden waar coaches, helers, therapeuten en facilitators een gratis account kunnen aanmaken, zodat de lezers van het boek iemand in hun buurt kunnen vinden voor extra hulp i.v.m. één van de tools of methoden die ik in het boek beschrijf (of voor iets anders). De reden waarom ik dit aanbied, komt voort uit mijn eigen ervaring: nadat ik had gelezen over een interessante tool of methode vond ik meestal niemand in de buurt die me kon helpen om deze toe te passen. Mijn intentie met deze gids is dat iedereen een coach, therapeut, heler of facilitator in zijn of haar eigen buurt kan vinden. Om de drempel voor zowel de lezers als de coaches, therapeuten, helers en facilitators te verlagen, wordt <b>deze gids gratis aangeboden</b>.</li>

<p></p><h3>Hoe Je Kan Helpen</h3><p></p>
<p>
Crowdfunding gaat over het creëren van een win-win situatie voor alle betrokkenen: de eigenaar van de campagne biedt iets speciaals aan en door deze producten of diensten (die ""perks"" worden genoemd) te kopen, zorgen de ""contributors"" voor de fondsen om het project te doen slagen.</p>

<h3>Veel gestelde vragen</h3>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>“Waarom gebruik je crowdfunding voor het project?“</li>
<ul>
<li>Bij het uitgeven op de traditionele manier duurt het ongeveer een jaar voor een boek op de markt komt. Mijn intuïtie zei me dat dit boek vroeger beschikbaar diende te zijn. Daarom heb ik het model van self-publishing gekozen. Dit betekent ook dat alle kosten die bij uitgeven komen kijken bij mij terecht komen.</li>
<li>Crowdfunding is een alternatief voor het aangaan van een lening bij een bank. En i.p.v. mensen te vragen geld te doneren of geld te lenen, krijgen ze er nu iets voor in de plaats. In het geval van deze campagne is dat een boek, een playshop, een presentatie, …</li>
</ul>
<li>“Wat als de campagne niet genoeg fondsen ophaalt? Krijg ik dan nog steeds de “perk” die ik besteld heb of ben ik mijn geld kwijt?”</li>
<ul>
<li>De status is dat het Engelse boek nu in de fase van layouting zit. De Nederlandse versie zit in de laatste fase van editing en proofreading. Ze zullen er dus komen en je zal hen ontvangen. De andere “perks” zullen ook geleverd worden zelfs als de campagne het vooropgestelde bedrag niet haalt.</li>
<li>Als de campagne niet genoeg geld oplevert, zal ik naar de bank gaan of andere bronnen aanboren om extra fondsen te verzamelen. Het zou echter fijn zijn om dit niet te hoeven doen ☺.</li>
</ul>
<li>“Wat is de huidige status?”</li>
<ul>
<li>7/11: het Engelse boek bevindt zich nu in de fase van het lay-outen. De Nederlandse versie bevindt zich in de laatste fase van proofreading.</li>
<li>9/11: de illustraties van het boek zijn afgewerkt. Je vindt enkele van hen op deze pagina.</li>
<li>13/11: uittreksels van het boek zijn aan deze pagina toegevoegd.</li>
</ul>
<li>“Waarom zijn er zoveel verschillende perks?”</li>
<ul>
<li>Niet iedereen heeft dezelfde voorkeuren. Daarom is er dus een waaier van mogelijkheden.</li>
</ul>
<li>""Ik heb problemen met betalen via PayPal of via credit card (of ik heb dit niet).”</li>
<ul>
<li>Stuur dan een email naar connect@life-is-a-game.org en we zullen een alternatieve oplossing vinden.</li>

Short Summary

Life seems to be hard for many people. However, it doesn’t
have to be that way.
Actually, life isn’t supposed to be hard. It is supposed to
be fun, effortless and joyous!
That’s what I discovered after having my own share of
worries, fears and even a burnout.
Since the world can use more light, I’m sharing my
insights, experiences and even my own fears (and how I dealt with them) in a new book: “Life is a Game!”
To be able to reach more people and create a website with
free resources and a directory of coaches, therapists, healers and facilitators, free for both the ones providing support and the ones seeking it, I
welcome your support.
On this page you will read more about my background, what
the book (and the rest of the project) is about, what the project still requires and which bargains you can do ☺.

My Background
My name is Jan Vermeiren. You might know me of the books
“Let’s Connect!” and “How to REALLY use LinkedIn!”, but chances are that you have never heard of me at all ☺.


Allow me to share a bit more about myself and the project.
If you have read “Let’s Connect!” or “How to REALLY use
LinkedIn” you will have experienced that all the online and offline networking
tips I shared were based upon a solid foundation: fundamental,
universal or spiritual laws. They are the base to build further upon.
Without them all the practical tips would only be beneficial for a small fraction
of their potential.
This applies not only to networking, but to all other areas of life as
well. 

I have been a student of how these laws work for over 12
years. However, only a few years ago, I really started to grasp what I now call
the “Game of Life”. I also began to understand why my results were inconsistent
before (from creating a best seller to almost bankruptcy).
In the ""darker days"" I even had a kind of burnout. I explicitly write ""a kind of burnout"" since I was too busy noticing it ☺.

As with many people with a burnout these events invited me to look deeper. As a result I discovered a few other layers in life (I call them phases in the book). And suddenly everything began to make sense. I realized that Life IS a Game. When looking at Life from this point of view, it doesn’t only get easier to understand and to play it, but it also becomes much lighter and much more joyful!I also discovered that monsters, trains, teddy bears, GPS systems and even computer games are great analogies to explain the more complex universal laws. When I started using them I saw people immediately grasp what it was all about. So it dawned on me how Life REALLY is a game, but the rules and
setup were never communicated or taught. Or rather, they WERE communicated (by
for example religious texts), but most of us didn’t grasp the practical meaning
or implication.One of the goals of the book “Life is a Game” is to translate these
sometimes hard to read or understand documents into normal, day-to-day language.
That’s why I’m using a lot of funny and
easy-to-grasp metaphors to clarify what really is going on and how to make changes.
The Book ""Life is a Game!""

The book is about the 3 phases of Life. It gives more
insight into why we sometimes feel that Life is hard and how to change that. It shows that en-light-enment doesn’t mean sitting on a mountain and suddenly
disappear in a bundle of radiating light (although some of you may find that
very cool ☺),
but that it is about living a life in human form that feels light, joyous and
effortless.So you could call it a book that translates ""high-in-the-sky"" concepts into ""down-to-earth"", practical tips.To start,  I not only share 10 invitations to start
experiencing a lighter life, but also several “emergency tools” to assist the reader in immediately transforming situations in which they feel overwhelmed.

Once they have experienced more inner peace coming and going,
I share 7 ways on how to sustain that state so they don’t fall back into
situations with lots of turmoil.

Now we have a solid foundation to start building our dream
life. I’ll share how to attract everything one desires and also why the so-called ""Law of
Attraction"" doesn’t seem to work for many people (and what to do about that).
Last but not least I’ll show 7 keys to a Joyful Life in
harmony with yourself and all other people in your life. 
I will also share lots of personal experiences with applying
the tips. Both the fears and emotions that I experienced on the one hand (which is not so common for a man according to a female proofreader ☺) and the joy that I had on the other hand. Since it's a book about living a Joyful Life it has a light tone of voice and contains lots of humor as well!

Why Your Support Is Welcome
Now that you know what the book is about, let me explain the
status of the project and why I welcome your help. 

The current status is that I have written the book in
English. Because I’m a native Dutch speaker some editing will need to be done.
A cover needs to be designed and visuals need to be purchased. Those costs are already covered.
Why I welcome your support (= for which parts of the project funds are still needed):


To reach a larger audience with this positive message the book will be published in two languages (English and Dutch) at the same time. This involves translating,
editing, proofreading and extra visuals. To remain independent, the book will be self-published. This includes upfront paying for the printing and storage space for the books.The press likes review copies so those need to be printed, packaged and sent.
A website for the book will be built in two
languages (to start with) providing extra background information, resources and
exercises regarding the topics of the book. Extra articles, video tips, interviews etc. will be added on a regular basis. This website and all
its resources will be made available for free so everybody can benefit from them whatever their financial situation is.
On top of that, a free worldwide
directory will be created on the website where coaches, healers, therapists and facilitators can create a free
account so readers of the book can find someone in their area for extra support related to tools or methods described in the book or anything else they
need help with. The reason I offer this directory emerged from my own
experience: after reading other books about an interesting method, tool or healing practice
I was unable to find someone close to me who could help me with applying it. My intention for this
directory is that everyone will be able to find a coach, therapist, healer or
facilitator nearby. To lower the barrier for both readers and coaches / facilitators / healers / therapists, this directory will be offered for free.

FAQ


“Why do you use crowd funding for the project?“

Traditional publishing takes a year for books to get into bookstores. My gut feeling said this book needed to be birthed sooner. That’s why it’s self-published. This also means that all the normal publishing costs are for me.
Crowd funding is an alternative for asking a bank for a loan. And instead of asking people to donate or loan money, they get something in return. In the case of this campaign it is a book, a playshop, a presentation, … 

""What if the campaign doesn’t get enough funds? Will I receive the “perk” I ordered or do I lose my money?”

The status is that the English book is now in the stage of lay-outing. The Dutch version is in the final stages of editing and proofreading. So you will receive them. The other “perks” will also be available even if the campaign doesn’t raise enough money.
If the campaign doesn’t raise enough money, I will go to the bank or other sources to get extra funding. However, it would be nice not to have to do that ☺.

“What is the current status?”

Nov 7: English book is now in the stage of lay-outing. The Dutch version is in the final stages of editing and proofreading.
Nov 9: The illustrations of the book are ready. You will find a few of them on this page.
Nov 13: excerpts from the book are added to this page.

“Why so many different perks?”

Not everybody likes the same thing. So that’s why there is a variety of choices.

“I have problems with paying via PayPal or credit card (or don’t have them).“

Just send an email to connect@life-is-a-game.org and we will find an alternative solution.






Nederlandse versie
Korte Samenvatting

Voor veel mensen lijkt het leven moeilijk. Dit hoeft echter niet zo te zijn.


Meer nog, het leven hoort niet moeilijk of lastig te zijn. De bedoeling is dat het leuk, moeiteloos en vreugdevol is!


Dat heb ik ontdekt na veel ervaringen van angsten, zorgen en zelfs een burn-out.


Aangezien de wereld wat licht en lichtheid kan gebruiken, deel ik mijn inzichten, ervaringen en zelfs mijn eigen angsten (en hoe ik ermee omgegaan ben) in een nieuw boek: ""Life is a Game!""


Om meer mensen te kunnen bereiken en een website met gratis informatie en een gids van coaches, therapeuten, helers en facilitators te kunnen aanbieden die gratis is voor zowel hen die hulp bieden als zoeken, is jouw ondersteuning welkom.


Op deze pagina lees je meer over mijn achtergrond, waar het boek (en de rest van het project) over gaat, welke delen van het project nog hulp kunnen gebruiken en welke koopjes je kan doen ☺.


Mijn Achtergrond

Mijn naam is Jan Vermeiren. Je kent me misschien van de boeken “Let’s Connect!” en “Hoe LinkedIn nu ECHT gebruiken”, maar de kans is minstens even groot dat je nog nooit van mij hebt gehoord ☺.


Laat me dus iets meer over mezelf en over het project vertellen.


Als je ""Let's Connect!"" of ""Hoe LinkedIn nu ECHT gebruiken"" hebt gelezen, dan zal je ervaren hebben dat alle tips m.b.t. online en offline netwerken gebaseerd zijn op een stevige fundering: de fundamentele, universele of spirituele wetten. Ze zijn de basis waarop de tips rusten. Zonder dit fundament zouden de tips slechts een fractie van hun potentieel opleveren. Dit is niet enkel met netwerken zo, maar met alle aspecten van ons leven.


Al meer dan 12 jaar ben ik een ""student"" van hoe deze wetten werken. Maar slechts een paar jaar geleden begon ik écht te begrijpen hoe ""The Game of Life"" werkt. Ik begon in te zien waarom mijn resultaten niet consistent waren (van het creëren van bestsellers tot bijna failliet gaan).
In de ""donkere dagen"" had ik zelfs een soort van burnout. Ik schrijf expliciet ""soort van"" aangezien ik het te druk had om deze op te merken ☺.Zoals het geval is met zoveel anderen die een burnout hebben, werd ik uitgenodigd om dieper te kijken. Het resultaat was dat ik een aantal extra lagen in het leven ontdekte (ik noem hen fasen in het boek). En plots begon alles veel duidelijker te worden. Ik realiseerde me dat het Leven ECHT een spel is. Wanneer je op die manier naar het leven kan kijken, dan wordt het niet enkel gemakkelijker om het te begrijpen en het te spelen, maar het wordt ook veel lichter en vreugdevoller!Ik ontdekte ook dat monsters, treinen, teddyberen, GPS systemen en zelfs computer games fantastische analogieën opleveren om de meer complexe universele wetten uit te leggen. Wanneer ik hen begon te gebruiken, zag ik dat anderen direct oppikten waar het over ging.Ik zie nu hoe het Leven ECHT een spel is waarvan de regels en hoe het opgezet is, nooit werden gecommuniceerd. Of liever, ze WERDEN gecommuniceerd (bv. in religieuze teksten), maar de meesten onder ons begrepen niet wat er werkelijk stond of hoe het praktisch toe te passen. Eén van de doelen van ""Life is a Game!"", is om deze soms moeilijk lees- of verstaanbare documenten te vertalen naar normale, dagdagelijkse taal. Daarom gebruik ik grappige en gemakkelijk begrijpbare metaforen om te verduidelijken wat er echt aan de hand is en hoe dit te veranderen (als je dat zou willen).


Het Boek ""Life is a Game!""
Het boek gaat over de 3 Levensfasen. Het geeft inzichten in waarom het soms lijkt dat het leven moeilijk is en hoe dat te veranderen. Ik toon dat ver-licht-ing niet betekent hoog op een berg te gaan zitten en plots te verdwijnen in een bundel van stralend licht (hoewel sommige mensen dat heel cool zouden vinden ☺), maar dat het gaat om een leven te leiden in een menselijke vorm dat licht, vreugdevol en moeiteloos is.Je zou het dus een boek kunnen noemen dat ""high-in-the-sky"" concepten vertaalt in ""down-to-earth"" praktische tips.Om te beginnen deel ik niet enkel 10 uitnodigingen om meer lichtheid in het leven te ervaren, maar ik beschrijf ook een aantal ""emergency tools"" die de lezer onmiddellijk helpen wanneer die zich overweldigd voelt.
Eenmaal dat hij of zij al regelmatig meer innerlijke vrede heeft ervaren, toon ik 7 manieren om die staat van zijn te kunnen behouden zodat hij of zij niet terugvalt in situaties met veel chaos.
Dan is er een solide basis waarop hij of zij zijn/haar droomleven kan bouwen. Ik deel hoe alles aan te trekken wat iemand verlangt en ook waarom de zogenaamde ""Wet van Aantrekking"" niet lijkt te werken voor veel mensen (en wat daaraan te doen).Last but not least, toon ik 7 sleutels voor een Joyful Life in harmonie met jezelf en alle andere mensen in je leven.Ik deel tevens verschillende persoonlijke voorbeelden van hoe ik de tips heb toegepast. Zowel mijn angsten en emoties (wat volgens een vrouwelijke proeflezer niet gebruikelijk is voor een man ☺) als de successen en de Joy die ik heb mogen ervaren, komen aan bod. Aangezien het boek gaat over een ""Joyful Life"" is de toon van het boek licht en doorspekt met veel (zelf-relativerende) humor.

Waarom Jouw Hulp Welkom Is
Nu dat je weet waar het boek over gaat, geef ik je de status van het project en deel ik waarom jouw steun welkom is. 


Ik heb het boek in het Engels geschreven. Aangezien ik Nederlandstalig ben, moet dit nog ""opgeschoond"" en nagelezen worden. Ook de layout dient voorzien te worden, een cover dient gecreëerd te worden en cartoons dienen getekend te worden. Hierin heb ik zelf al geïnvesteerd, dus dat is al in orde.

Dit dient nog te gebeuren (= voor deze zaken zijn er nog fondsen nodig):

Om meer mensen te kunnen bereiken met deze positieve boodschap, wordt het boek op hetzelfde moment in twee talen uitgebracht (Engels en Nederlands). Dat betekent vertalen, redigeren, proeflezen en extra tekeningen. Om het project onafhankelijk te houden, wordt het boek via het self-publishing concept in de wereld gezet. Dit houdt o.a. in: de drukker vooraf betalen en opslagruimte huren voor de boeken. Aangezien de pers graag beoordelingsexemplaren heeft, dienen die gedrukt, verpakt en opgestuurd te worden.
Er zal een website gebouwd worden voor het boek in twee talen (om te beginnen) met extra achtergrond informatie en oefeningen m.b.t. de topics van het boek. Er zullen op regelmatige basis extra artikels, video clips, interviews, enz. toegevoegd worden. Deze website met informatie wordt gratis aangeboden zodat iedereen er toegang toe heeft of ze nu genoeg financiële middelen hebben of niet.

Op de website zal ook een wereldwijde gratis gids voorzien worden waar coaches, helers, therapeuten en facilitators een gratis account kunnen aanmaken, zodat de lezers van het boek iemand in hun buurt kunnen vinden voor extra hulp i.v.m. één van de tools of methoden die ik in het boek beschrijf (of voor iets anders). De reden waarom ik dit aanbied, komt voort uit mijn eigen ervaring: nadat ik had gelezen over een interessante tool of methode vond ik meestal niemand in de buurt die me kon helpen om deze toe te passen. Mijn intentie met deze gids is dat iedereen een coach, therapeut, heler of facilitator in zijn of haar eigen buurt kan vinden. Om de drempel voor zowel de lezers als de coaches, therapeuten, helers en facilitators te verlagen, wordt deze gids gratis aangeboden.

Hoe Je Kan Helpen

Crowdfunding gaat over het creëren van een win-win situatie voor alle betrokkenen: de eigenaar van de campagne biedt iets speciaals aan en door deze producten of diensten (die ""perks"" worden genoemd) te kopen, zorgen de ""contributors"" voor de fondsen om het project te doen slagen.
Ik heb de ""perks"" in twee categorieën verdeeld:

Pre-order van het boek (digitaal, papier, package deal)
Verschillende vormen van een ""Life is a Game!"" experience.
Je vindt de lijst met ""perks"" aan de rechterkant. Je kan degene die je verkiest selecteren door op de omschrijving te klikken.

Opmerking: je kan je credit card of PayPal gebruiken om bij te dragen. Wanneer je op de betaalpagina komt, dien je op de ""Go to PayPal"" knop te drukken (het is de enige optie). Op het volgende scherm kan je onderaan het scherm voor ""Pay with credit card"" kiezen als je met een credit card wil betalen.
Hier volgt een omschrijving van alle ""perks"":

Deze playshops zullen beginnen in het voorjaar van 2015 en regelmatig georganiseerd worden gedurende de rest van het jaar.

Opmerkingen:
Normale prijs: 75 euro.
Je krijgt ook een papieren exemplaar van ""Life is a Game!"" (in het Nederlands). Opmerking: als je zeker wil zijn dat je het voor 20 december 2014 hebt, dien je op de volgende pagina 10 euro als ""additional gift"" bij te storten voor spoedzending. Anders zal je het een aantal dagen later ontvangen.

Deze playshops zullen op verschillende locaties doorheen België en Nederland gehouden worden. Er zal er dus zeker één in jouw buurt plaatsvinden.
De prijs is inclusief 21% BTW (als je een bedrijf hebt, betaal je dus slechts 37,20 euro). Je krijgt een officiële factuur.



Life is a
Game Experience (250 euro). Neem deel aan een 2-daags evenement (zaterdag-zondag) in België of Nederland om een lichter en meer Joyful Life te beginnen leven. Deze evenementen zullen beginnen in het voorjaar van 2015 en regelmatig georganiseerd worden gedurende de rest van het jaar.

Marketing
Genius (500 euro): Ik zal tonen hoe ik van mijn vorige boeken ""Let's Connect!"" en ""Hoe LinkedIn nu ECHT gebruiken"" internationale best sellers maakte en wat mijn aanpak voor ""Life is a Game!"" is.

Normale prijs: 1000 euro.
Dit omvat o.a. marketing, social media, hoe de pers benaderen, crowdfunding, hoe de kracht van een netwerk inschakelen en de toepassing van universele/spirituele wetten.
Dit zal een reeks zijn van 5 maandelijkse webinars (inclusief opname) die starten in Januari 2015 (in het Engels), één uur persoonlijke coaching via Skype of telefoon (Engels of Nederlands) en onbeperkte email correspondentie gedurende deze periode. 
Ik zal niet enkel mijn strategieën delen, maar ook de vooruitgang van dit project (zowel de successen als de mislukkingen).

De focus ligt op hoe een boek succesvol te maken, maar de meeste strategieën kunnen ook toegepast worden op andere producten en diensten.
Omwille van de persoonlijke aandacht die deze ""perk"" vraagt, is de groep beperkt tot 20 deelnemers.

De prijs is inclusief 21% BTW (als je een bedrijf hebt, betaal je dus slechts 412 euro). Je krijgt een officiële factuur.

Dit is iets dat ik nog nooit heb aangeboden en waarschijnlijk nooit meer zal doen!





Andere manieren waarop je kan helpen

Naast het kopen van een ""perk"", kan je het project steunen door deze crowdfunding campagne te delen met je familie, vrienden, collega's en andere mensen uit je netwerk door hen te emailen of door het te vermelden op social media als Facebook, Twitter of LinkedIn.Bovenaan de pagina staan er enkele knoppen om het je gemakkelijk te maken! 
Opmerking: als je op dit moment niet wil of kan helpen, maar op de hoogte wil blijven wanneer het boek (en de website) klaar zijn, dan kan je je naam en email adres achterlaten op de website www.life-is-a-game.org

Veel gestelde vragen


“Waarom gebruik je crowdfunding voor het project?“

Bij het uitgeven op de traditionele manier duurt het ongeveer een jaar voor een boek op de markt komt. Mijn intuïtie zei me dat dit boek vroeger beschikbaar diende te zijn. Daarom heb ik het model van self-publishing gekozen. Dit betekent ook dat alle kosten die bij uitgeven komen kijken bij mij terecht komen.
Crowdfunding is een alternatief voor het aangaan van een lening bij een bank. En i.p.v. mensen te vragen geld te doneren of geld te lenen, krijgen ze er nu iets voor in de plaats. In het geval van deze campagne is dat een boek, een playshop, een presentatie, …

“Wat als de campagne niet genoeg fondsen ophaalt? Krijg ik dan nog steeds de “perk” die ik besteld heb of ben ik mijn geld kwijt?”

De status is dat het Engelse boek nu in de fase van layouting zit. De Nederlandse versie zit in de laatste fase van editing en proofreading. Ze zullen er dus komen en je zal hen ontvangen. De andere “perks” zullen ook geleverd worden zelfs als de campagne het vooropgestelde bedrag niet haalt.
Als de campagne niet genoeg geld oplevert, zal ik naar de bank gaan of andere bronnen aanboren om extra fondsen te verzamelen. Het zou echter fijn zijn om dit niet te hoeven doen ☺.

“Wat is de huidige status?”

7/11: het Engelse boek bevindt zich nu in de fase van het lay-outen. De Nederlandse versie bevindt zich in de laatste fase van proofreading.
9/11: de illustraties van het boek zijn afgewerkt. Je vindt enkele van hen op deze pagina.
13/11: uittreksels van het boek zijn aan deze pagina toegevoegd.

“Waarom zijn er zoveel verschillende perks?”

Niet iedereen heeft dezelfde voorkeuren. Daarom is er dus een waaier van mogelijkheden.

""Ik heb problemen met betalen via PayPal of via credit card (of ik heb dit niet).”

Stuur dan een email naar connect@life-is-a-game.org en we zullen een alternatieve oplossing vinden.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<li>
<strong>!!KEY!!</strong> Pay for our 501 c(3) non-profit incorporation<strong> (Price tag: $675.00). </strong>Once we have this, we are eligible for public city, state and national funding. </li>

</ul>
<p>If we are unsuccessful in reaching our entire goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>All funds gathered will be used firstly, towards our incorporation as a 501 c(3) non-profit organization and secondly, towards printing as many copies of our first <em>stolon</em> as possible. </li>

Simply put, I can't transfer safely from my power wheelchair to my Honda Element and back, and of course as it stands now I can't take the chair with me.</p>
<p>The welfare/warfare State, as expected, has left me in limbo. That's why I began this fundraiser, I need to recover as much of my life as I can and restoring my freedom of mobility will do just that.</p>
<p>I'm not sure I've been communicating this well enough, but please understand that <strong>this vehicle modification is not a luxury or frivolity, it's <em>absolutely essential</em> if I'm to recover my life and get it out of that limbo, as well as removing the risk of a harmful or even fatal fall when I must go out.</strong> Right now these outings are limited to once every 2-3 months for physician visits to refill the medications I'm reliant upon...nothing else is worth that risk. For 3 years now, I haven't been living but merely existing, and watching the days go by from the (admittedly soft) prison of my home is really taking its toll on me, mentally, physically and spiritually. I'm not engaging in hyperbole or a maudlin assessment here; my life really is literally bleeding out.</p>
<p><strong>Don't forget to check out additional pics and videos in the 'Gallery' link up top while you're here for more info!</strong></p>
<p>Not long after starting my fundraising blog, I also was encouraged to begin writing for publication...I was happily surprised to find I have some competence at this, and being able to help spread the word about the movement for liberty in America has opened up a whole new purpose for me, as a journalist with the New Media that's fast replacing the limited and controlled dinosaur media of the past. My thanks to the Behreandts at the <a href=""http://www.americandailyherald.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">American Daily Herald</a> for this opportunity! If you haven't yet seen my work, perhaps you'd care to check out my <a href=""http://www.americandailyherald.com/pundits/glenn-horowitz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">column</a>.</p>
<p>I've had the privilege of appearing on the '<a href=""http://www.blogtalkradio.com/combatveteransforronpaul"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Language of Liberty</a>' podcast produced by the <a href=""http://cvrp2012.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Combat Veterans for Ron Paul</a>, the <a href=""http://www.truthfindersnetwork.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Truth Finders Network</a>, and most recently on '<a href=""http://www.radioio.com/btls/channels/bubba-one-live/?rp=genre/btls"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dangerous Conversation</a>' with Scott Ledger on Radio IO in recent months to discuss my situation...the word's getting around!</p>
<p>Still, there's only so much I can do from my desk. I'm running this short term Indiegogo fundraiser since time is short: if I'm to be able to get down to Tampa to experience the events surrounding the RNC in August this goal needs to be reached quickly...it takes a minimum of six weeks to modify my Honda Element for wheelchair access, so this is an all-or-nothing campaign; if the goal isn't met, everyone gets their money back and I go back to where I am today with just over $9000 already raised.</p>
<p>If enough people see this project, it'll succeed. I've got a great start, I have the power chair, the Honda Element and just under $9000 already raised! <strong>Every donation counts, no matter the size. I've been happy to send thank you notes out for donations from $1 to $1000, and I'm grateful for every one I've received. I can't wait to send the rest when this is done!</strong></p>
<p>There will be perks added for donors of smaller amounts shortly, but here's the big one: If the goal of $21,000 is met or exceeded, I'm going to insert in my will that the person or their designated favorite institution who gets the biggest number of donations from an awareness-raising YouTube campaign, say, or who makes the single largest individual donation will get my house in Nashville, Tennessee, the 1/2 acre it sits on, along with my firearms collection, original art work I've collected, and my hobby gear and high quality collectibles like my vintage and reproduction tinplate toys after I'm gone.</p>
<p>True, that's not something for the impatient, but you could secure some nice property for your kids or grandkids years down the road, a property appraised at $148,000 in 2001 as well as loads of other goodies for a contribution of $21000 or less now. I plan to live for some years yet, so keep in mind that you won't be collecting this uber-perk for some time. Think of it as a long term investment if you like. This 'everything' offer will not be repeated.</p>
<p>Remember, this is going to be <em>inserted in my will</em>, since I have no heirs or spouse. There are only a couple of conditions:</p>
<p>1) Should I predecease my mom, she as the executor of my will has the right to occupy the house for the remainder of her life. I will not risk her having to relocate at her age of nearly 75 years. No one gets the house and property until <em>both</em> of us are gone.</p>
<p>2) If someone gets the clever idea of 'disposing' of me or my mom to get the house early, there will be a codicil that if the winner's involved in any foul play surrounding my demise, they lose the inheritance and my home and property will go to someone of my choosing.</p>
<p>That's pretty much it. Indiegogo will also show a counter for funds pledged, something my blog hasn't been capable of but has been requested.My original goal of $26,000 has been increased to a full $30,000, to cover the cost of physically getting my Element to and from Freedom Motors' facility in Michigan, about $1500, with the remainder to assure I'll have travel, lodging and equipment expenses covered for the Tampa adventure, that's why I'm offering to will all I have to whoever best makes it happen in time.</p>
<p>I have a lot of living left to do, beginning with being able to get to Tampa, meet up with my supporters like Tatiana Moroz, Jordan Page and my brothers in the Combat Veterans for Ron Paul, and support them in their taking a stand for liberty, as well as gathering material like pics, videos and interviews to compose a solid article for the Herald.</p>
<p>This is your chance too to prove to the world that voluntary charitable action is far superior to the coerced government 'charity' Libertarians, freedom lovers, and anarcho capitalists have been talking about this for years...well, now's your opportunity to prove it for all the world to see!</p></div>","The details of why and how my disability has created this situation are detailed in the Mission In a Nutshell section of my original fundraising blog, Get Glenn Mobile!, but suffice to say that multiple sclerosis has made me a housebound prisoner.

I'm running this short term Indiegogo fundraiser since time is short: if I'm to be able to get down to Tampa to experience the events surrounding the RNC in August this goal needs to be reached quickly...it takes a minimum of six weeks to modify my Honda Element for wheelchair access, so this is an all-or-nothing campaign; if the goal isn't met, everyone gets their money back and I go back to where I am today with just over $9000 already raised.
If enough people see this project, it'll succeed. I've got a great start, I have the power chair, the Honda Element and just under $9000 already raised! Every donation counts, no matter the size. I've been happy to send thank you notes out for donations from $1 to $1000, and I'm grateful for every one I've received. I can't wait to send the rest when this is done!
There will be perks added for donors of smaller amounts shortly, but here's the big one: If the goal of $21,000 is met or exceeded, I'm going to insert in my will that the person or their designated favorite institution who gets the biggest number of donations from an awareness-raising YouTube campaign, say, or who makes the single largest individual donation will get my house in Nashville, Tennessee, the 1/2 acre it sits on, along with my firearms collection, original art work I've collected, and my hobby gear and high quality collectibles like my vintage and reproduction tinplate toys after I'm gone.
True, that's not something for the impatient, but you could secure some nice property for your kids or grandkids years down the road, a property appraised at $148,000 in 2001 as well as loads of other goodies for a contribution of $21000 or less now. I plan to live for some years yet, so keep in mind that you won't be collecting this uber-perk for some time. Think of it as a long term investment if you like. This 'everything' offer will not be repeated.
Remember, this is going to be inserted in my will, since I have no heirs or spouse. There are only a couple of conditions:
1) Should I predecease my mom, she as the executor of my will has the right to occupy the house for the remainder of her life. I will not risk her having to relocate at her age of nearly 75 years. No one gets the house and property until both of us are gone.
2) If someone gets the clever idea of 'disposing' of me or my mom to get the house early, there will be a codicil that if the winner's involved in any foul play surrounding my demise, they lose the inheritance and my home and property will go to someone of my choosing.
That's pretty much it. Indiegogo will also show a counter for funds pledged, something my blog hasn't been capable of but has been requested.My original goal of $26,000 has been increased to a full $30,000, to cover the cost of physically getting my Element to and from Freedom Motors' facility in Michigan, about $1500, with the remainder to assure I'll have travel, lodging and equipment expenses covered for the Tampa adventure, that's why I'm offering to will all I have to whoever best makes it happen in time.
I have a lot of living left to do, beginning with being able to get to Tampa, meet up with my supporters like Tatiana Moroz, Jordan Page and my brothers in the Combat Veterans for Ron Paul, and support them in their taking a stand for liberty, as well as gathering material like pics, videos and interviews to compose a solid article for the Herald.
This is your chance too to prove to the world that voluntary charitable action is far superior to the coerced government 'charity' Libertarians, freedom lovers, and anarcho capitalists have been talking about this for years...well, now's your opportunity to prove it for all the world to see!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</p><p>I am going to Afghanistan this December to embed with U.S.

the war personal for people back home, to find some way to make combat in a faraway land a reality for people who have no real experience from which to
draw on for comparison.</p>

<p><b>Quick Summary of the Campaign:</b></p>
<p>Help two entrepreneurial authors breathe life into CLaW
Publishing &amp; achieve their goal of entertaining readers with their stories
aimed at both young and old.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">*  *  *</p>

<p><b>Who are Ben Finn and Marc Webb?</b></p>
<p><b>Ben Finn:</b></p>
<p>Ben loves to entertain. Since he can’t sing and can’t
act...well...he turned to writing. Kill Them Dead was written with his best
friend and writing partner Marc Webb.</p>
<p>When he is not writing you will find Ben spending time with
his 2 year old son and wife, on the golf course (cursing), reading, enjoying a
movie or getting involved in some new TV series. But most of the time he will
simply daydream another story…</p>
<p><b>Marc Webb:</b></p>
<p>Marc grew up in a relatively poor environment. Not having
access to the toys and other luxuries of the more “better-off” kids in the
neighborhood, he turned to books and soon consumed up to three novels per day.
He also cultivated his imagination by turning everyday objects like sticks and
stones into battleships and castles.</p>
<p>His love for storytelling began when he cut out the
characters (in various poses) of a Superman comic. He would then re-structure
the characters to play out hundreds of other stories that his mind conjured up.
Today he likes to write thrillers and horrors and looks forward to creating
interesting stories and characters with his friend and writing partner, Ben
Finn.</p>

<p><b>What is Kill Them Dead?</b></p>
<p><i>Kill Them Dead: Genesis</i>
is a serialized Zombie Horror story that’s broken down into five bite-sized
episodes. Almost like a television series, each episode ends with a
cliff-hanger, leaving the reader hungry for more.</p>
<p>After the final episode went up, we bundled the lot and
released the entire first season as a box set available on Amazon for Kindle
readers.</p>

<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We currently have Season 2 and 3 planned for 2014 after
which we would like to release a HOW TO WRITE SERIALIZED FICTION book. Most of
the book will consist of practical advice and examples based on how we planned
and wrote our serialized stories. From there we will open the <i>Kill Them Dead</i> universe to fan writers
who would like to branch out and take the story into unique and exciting directions.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Praise for <i>Kill Them Dead - Genesis</i>:</b></p>
<p>“Best thing I’ve read in all 2013, if you ever release it in
physical form you have 3 purchases from me.”</p>
<p>“I just GOT TO KNOW
what happens next.”</p>
<p>“The story had me
in its grips.”</p>
<p>“Zombie lovers and
sci-fi horror fans, I'm sure this will be right up your alley. I mean, come on,
how often do you find a book about zombies in space?”</p>
<p>“I was gripped from the moment I read Episode 1.”</p>

<p><b>What is ClaW Publishing?</b></p>
<p>When we initially sat down to discuss writing something
together, we soon discovered that we had more ideas for stories than we had time
to write. This prompted us to register ClaW Publishing Pty (Ltd), an indie
ePublishing company through which we will publish and upload our collaborative
and single works.</p>
<p>As we neared the completion of the <i>Kill Them Dead: Genesis</i> series, we realized that in order to
release Season 2 and 3 (as well as a ton of other stories) sooner, we would
have to put some serious thought and effort into running the business
full-time.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal of entertaining readers with our
stories, we decided to turn towards crowd funding, to humbly ask friends and
fans to pitch in and help out. In short, we need <b><i>YOUR</i></b> help to get there!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">*  *  *</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Our IndieGoGo Goal: How much funding do we need?</b></p>
<p>In order to take the risk of building CLaW Publishing into a
sustainable business venture, we would need at least $40 000 to cover all
expenses.</p>
<p>This is not a short-term campaign that will stop once a book
is written or a movie is made. We aim to dedicate the rest of our lives to the business
and hopefully leave a legacy that our children and their children could be a
part of long after we’re gone.</p>
<p>Your donation, no matter how small, will make a huge
difference and we are well aware that we couldn’t have done it without a single
dollar being contributed.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">*  *  *</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Why?</b></p>
<p>Your gracious donations would allow us to obtain a small
office from where we could work every day and will also cover basic costs such
as Internet access and hardware &amp; software required to perform our
day-to-day duties. We believe that if we can write full time, we would be able
to produce ten times more courses and books than if writing part time.</p>
<p>This will enable us to dedicate all our time on releasing
new products, be available for personal coaching sessions to aspiring authors,
and much, MUCH more!</p>

Help two entrepreneurial authors breathe life into CLaW
Publishing & achieve their goal of entertaining readers with their stories
aimed at both young and old.

*  *  *

Who are Ben Finn and Marc Webb?
Ben Finn:
Ben loves to entertain. Since he can’t sing and can’t
act...well...he turned to writing. Kill Them Dead was written with his best
friend and writing partner Marc Webb.
When he is not writing you will find Ben spending time with
his 2 year old son and wife, on the golf course (cursing), reading, enjoying a
movie or getting involved in some new TV series. But most of the time he will
simply daydream another story…
Marc Webb:
Marc grew up in a relatively poor environment. Not having
access to the toys and other luxuries of the more “better-off” kids in the
neighborhood, he turned to books and soon consumed up to three novels per day.
He also cultivated his imagination by turning everyday objects like sticks and
stones into battleships and castles.
His love for storytelling began when he cut out the
characters (in various poses) of a Superman comic. He would then re-structure
the characters to play out hundreds of other stories that his mind conjured up.
Today he likes to write thrillers and horrors and looks forward to creating
interesting stories and characters with his friend and writing partner, Ben
Finn.

What is Kill Them Dead?
Kill Them Dead: Genesis
is a serialized Zombie Horror story that’s broken down into five bite-sized
episodes. Almost like a television series, each episode ends with a
cliff-hanger, leaving the reader hungry for more.
After the final episode went up, we bundled the lot and
released the entire first season as a box set available on Amazon for Kindle
readers.





We currently have Season 2 and 3 planned for 2014 after
which we would like to release a HOW TO WRITE SERIALIZED FICTION book. Most of
the book will consist of practical advice and examples based on how we planned
and wrote our serialized stories. From there we will open the Kill Them Dead universe to fan writers
who would like to branch out and take the story into unique and exciting directions.

Praise for Kill Them Dead - Genesis:
“Best thing I’ve read in all 2013, if you ever release it in
physical form you have 3 purchases from me.”
“I just GOT TO KNOW
what happens next.”
“The story had me
in its grips.”
“Zombie lovers and
sci-fi horror fans, I'm sure this will be right up your alley. I mean, come on,
how often do you find a book about zombies in space?”
“I was gripped from the moment I read Episode 1.”

What is ClaW Publishing?
When we initially sat down to discuss writing something
together, we soon discovered that we had more ideas for stories than we had time
to write. This prompted us to register ClaW Publishing Pty (Ltd), an indie
ePublishing company through which we will publish and upload our collaborative
and single works.
As we neared the completion of the Kill Them Dead: Genesis series, we realized that in order to
release Season 2 and 3 (as well as a ton of other stories) sooner, we would
have to put some serious thought and effort into running the business
full-time.
To achieve this goal of entertaining readers with our
stories, we decided to turn towards crowd funding, to humbly ask friends and
fans to pitch in and help out. In short, we need YOUR help to get there!

*  *  *

Our IndieGoGo Goal: How much funding do we need?
In order to take the risk of building CLaW Publishing into a
sustainable business venture, we would need at least $40 000 to cover all
expenses.
This is not a short-term campaign that will stop once a book
is written or a movie is made. We aim to dedicate the rest of our lives to the business
and hopefully leave a legacy that our children and their children could be a
part of long after we’re gone.
Your donation, no matter how small, will make a huge
difference and we are well aware that we couldn’t have done it without a single
dollar being contributed.

*  *  *

Why?
Your gracious donations would allow us to obtain a small
office from where we could work every day and will also cover basic costs such
as Internet access and hardware & software required to perform our
day-to-day duties. We believe that if we can write full time, we would be able
to produce ten times more courses and books than if writing part time.
This will enable us to dedicate all our time on releasing
new products, be available for personal coaching sessions to aspiring authors,
and much, MUCH more!

*  *  *

This section is focused on reframing the historical narrative of several neighborhoods in Dallas. By bringing the narratives together, we are able to more clearly see the patterns of injustice existing in the built and political environment. We learn about how commonly highway construction bi-sected several communities of color in Dallas like North Dallas, Little Mexico, Deep Ellum, Tenth Street, and others. This section critically evaluates the history of a city thought to have no history at all and born out of nothing...which, is very far from the truth.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2 - (Re-Design)</strong> contains chapters 8-10. This section is focused on the ways we can take steps toward redesigning our cities in a more just and equitable way. The section highlights ideas from architects and designers across the country exploring how space and place play a role in shaping the way we interact with our cities. Stories, like Detroit Future City and Patterned Justice: Design Languages for a Just Pittsburgh, show how communities can identify disinvestment and create new patterns of justice in their cities. This section also explores how simple objects like plywood and shipping containers can reclaim space in and for a community. and imagine a new future.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3 - (Re-Invest)</strong> contains chapters 11-14. Finally, the book explores the ways various stakeholders can engage in more equitable reinvestment in their cities. Reinvestment applies not only to structures in the built environment but to the people involved in the process of building as well. We hear stories of developers in Dallas are changing the the traditional model of development and building community rather than corporate wealth.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>This campaign is to hire my editor to do his job so I can finish this book and get it out there. The cover is done, and my editor will be able to receive my manuscript once this campaign concludes and he is available. After that, it's revision and release.</li>
<li>I am committed to getting this done, despite being hospitalized this past year, and to that end I need help on financing critical steps.</li>
<li>All backers shall be thanked, by name upon request, when the book is published in addition to whatever Perks backers select. All backers who choose to get a book get a digital copy of the previous book as well.</li>
<li>The success of this campaign shall also serve to gauge interest for tie-ins to the series, and how to go about pursuing them</li>
<li>Stretch Goals are covered in the FAQ Tab.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Book</h3>
<p>     We pick up where ""Reavers"" left off, with our story's focus shifting to Earth and her solar system. Countess Gabriela Robin is in hiding, but she's threatening to go to Earth to speak of her experience at New Edinburgh to the Court of Stars and thus directly threaten the master villain of that raid: Count Vikuun Qis.</p>
<p>     Qis calls upon a new figure, Master Nimrod, to hunt her down before she can expose him. To ensure this succeeds, Qis throws Red Eyes and his pirates at the Solar Guard to keep them busy. The two strategies are meant to converge when Nimrod delivers Gabriela to the pirates to fulfill his promise to their mutual benefactor: the Architect.</p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Summary

This campaign is to hire my editor to do his job so I can finish this book and get it out there. The cover is done, and my editor will be able to receive my manuscript once this campaign concludes and he is available. After that, it's revision and release.
I am committed to getting this done, despite being hospitalized this past year, and to that end I need help on financing critical steps.
All backers shall be thanked, by name upon request, when the book is published in addition to whatever Perks backers select. All backers who choose to get a book get a digital copy of the previous book as well.
The success of this campaign shall also serve to gauge interest for tie-ins to the series, and how to go about pursuing them
Stretch Goals are covered in the FAQ Tab.

The Book
     We pick up where ""Reavers"" left off, with our story's focus shifting to Earth and her solar system. Countess Gabriela Robin is in hiding, but she's threatening to go to Earth to speak of her experience at New Edinburgh to the Court of Stars and thus directly threaten the master villain of that raid: Count Vikuun Qis.
     Qis calls upon a new figure, Master Nimrod, to hunt her down before she can expose him. To ensure this succeeds, Qis throws Red Eyes and his pirates at the Solar Guard to keep them busy. The two strategies are meant to converge when Nimrod delivers Gabriela to the pirates to fulfill his promise to their mutual benefactor: the Architect.
   The action and intrigue goes from Ganymede to Rome, and from ship-to-ship down to man-to-man, as both villain and hero attempt to outwit as well as outfight each other to determine the fate of the Songbird of Second Salisbury.
 
What I Need & What You Get

I need $1000 (US) to cover the cost of hiring my editor and ensuring print copy delivery to backers who opt for a copy. This is an all-or-nothing campaign, so if it fails you lose nothing.
All backers that select books for Perks get a copy of the first book in the series in E-Book format (Kindle or Epub). This ensures that you can catch up without worry if you're late to the party.
The array of Perks include the ability to become part of the series in some form if you like. Some will be locked at launch, requiring a threshold to be hit before I make them available. 

 
Impact
The previous campaign for Reavers of the Void did far better than I expected, and despite my post-campaign problems (being hospitalized makes things difficult) I cannot abandon my audience now. I'm continuing out of gratitude, and I hope you enjoy Hounds of Nimrod.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

This includes shipping inside Europe; please make it 55 total, for shipping worldwide. For a trifling 90 euros, you can get both books in hardback. This includes shipping inside Europe; please make it 95 for shipping worldwide.For a robust 100 euros, you can get the hardback, and a question answered on my blog; the question must be a) about swordsmanship b) answerable in 500-2000 words. This includes all shipping. For a generous 200 euros, you can get the Group Discount: 10 copies of either book (but not a mixture of both books) for your group to work from. Please add 20 euros for shipping outside Europe. You can add as many extra copies as you like for the same price: so eg. 15 copies would be 300, or 320 outside Europe. You can trade out any two paperbacks for one hardback, so if any of your group members have expensive tastes, this is a cheaper way to satisfy them.For an outstanding 500 euros, you can choose between 6 hardbacks or 12 paperbacks, a skype call, and request a video explanation of any section of the book, up to three separate drills. This will be posted on the wiki. The selection must be made within a year of the books being shipped.So, you really love books? For the princely sum of 1000€ you will get a hardback copy of both books for everyday use, and a hand-bound hand-stitched totally traditionally properly made copy of one of them that will outlast your great-grandchildren. These will be custom made by Michael Greer of leatherboundbindery.com, who makes books like this:Supporters of my previous campaigns might wonder where the ""Be the Patron"" perk is. I have already decided to dedicate the Longsword book to my parents, so that spot is taken, but please feel free to throw as much money into the pot as your generosity and current liquidity allows! I promise it will be spent both wisely and well.This is my fourth Indiegogo campaign. The previous three were:

The Syllabus Wiki Campaign was to raise money for the Syllabus Wiki: my swordsmanship curriculum videoed and put online as a free resource. We didn't make our target, but the work was done. You can see some of the longsword material here: 

Veni Vadi Vici was to publish a translation of a medieval combat treatise. That made its target, and the book came out on time.

Audatia was to raise funds for a card game based on a real medieval combat system. We raised a lot of money, and have just made good on the first two parts of our promise.
I hope it's clear that I make good on my promises: your money is in safe hands. So please help make this happen, by choosing a perk, and sharing this campaign!The ImpactThe Longsword book is about making Fiore dei Liberi's Art come alive in your hands. It provides everything a beginner needs to know to begin training, and I expect that some of the tips and tricks I have picked up in nearly 30 years of martial arts training will be useful to even the most advanced practitioners. By buying this book, you are supporting my work, and making it possible for me to spend all my efforts on recreating our lost martial heritage. I can't do it without you.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you like my work but are strapped for cash right now, then do not despair: please share! Let everyone know that this is happening, so that the books will be published, and you can buy them when circumstances improve, or borrow them from a friend. Thank you!",2.0,0,"6 Campaigns

<p><strong><i>Animal Behavior</i></strong> by Keller &amp; Marian Breland has been out of print for a long time, only available in rare situations.  The Brelands’ research broke ground for the development of animal behavior and training as a systematic process.  Understanding the science of how animals learn allows behavior modification of any animal of any species.  It’s easy to read, though the concepts are profound. </p>
<p> B. F. Skinner’s first graduate students, Marian and Keller Breland, helped him develop Operant Conditioning into a systematic technology that could be taught to others.  Moving forward with a successful business creating animal shows, working with the CIA and military organizations, and using operant conditioning to train animals of all kinds, they ended up partnering with Bob Bailey, the U.S. Navy’s first director of dolphin training.  The three of them brought this technology to the world.</p>
<p>Keller Breland died young, but Bob and Marian continued to impact the academic world of animal behavior, the sea parks of the world, military animal training, service dog training, and so much more over 50 years of running their business, Animal Behavior Enterprises, which in turn ran other businesses like the famous IQ Zoo.  Take a look at some of the fascinating information about their work here:</p>
<p><a href=""https://www3.uca.edu/iqzoo/iqzoo.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www3.uca.edu/iqzoo/iqzoo.htm</a></p>
<p>The relevance of this book to current animal behavior and training is unmistakable.  It’s the foundation of the techniques animal trainers and behavior consultants use every day.  You will learn why and how operant conditioning works.  You’ll gain important insights into behavior modification in many species and the history of the Brelands’ important discoveries about Instinctive Drift.  You’ll have your own reference to the basis of animal behavior and training, including writings of Ivan Pavlov, Konrad Lorenz, and others that were included in the 1966 edition as well as the 2018 edition. </p>
<p> The 2018 edition includes a brand-new introduction by Dr. Robert E. (Bob) Bailey, ScD, providing modern insight into this foundational work.  Pre-order your copy today.  Help us make the foundation of animal behavior and training available to everyone who cares about science. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We want to raise at least $5,000 for the initial publication of this seminal work, to ensure that it's once again available to the world. This money will offset the initial costs of publishing the book and cover the cost of the Indiegogo pre-release campaign.</p>
<p>We believe in the value of this book to the world, so we have made the necessary commitments to ensure it will be published. This book is only the first of a series of projects that will bring much more information on science-based animal training to trainers, behaviorists, and everyone who is interested in animal training and science of all kinds.  Your support of the re-release of this important text will let us know you want to see more!  Those of us committed to what is possible in humane, efficient, and effective animal training want to share the power of the science.  More books, DVDs, and even a documentary are in the works.</p>

<h3>What It Is About</h3>
<p>""The world around her seemed to melt away and dissolve into thick grey smoke, the light of the passing street lamps dimming and finally going out. Complete darkness surrounded her and yet she could see, as was the way of the realm. Therkous was her favorite plane, she loved it much more than the physical plane of Yumakous. It held possibilities and a freedom she’d never known in the waking world. Its shifting grey smoke holding the possibility of everything and nothing at the same time. She burned some of her energy and began to impress her will on the smoke as it started to condense and change color, twisting and collecting until before her a great garden began to form. It was her favorite thing about Therkous, the ability to make the garden she could only dream of. Large flowers of purples and blues bursting from a thick yellow clove carpeting, giant trees with orange leaves and white blossoms sprouting on spiraling twisted trunks growing in seconds, a large pond began to pool in the middle of the garden with tiger lilies (her favorite) growing in the water. In only a minute she had grown her sanctuary, and she reveled in it. ""</p>
<p>A Dream Of Therkous is the first book in a three book trilogy I am writing, book one is in the final editing process already with a publish date hopefully of April 2021. It is an inclusive fantasy novel set on a different version of our world, in a time not unlike Victorian times. The world is full of devilish characters, fantastical creatures, magic, and access to another realm while people sleep; Therkous. Therkous is the dream realm, the plane of possibilities. A place where one can create anything they wish, for the cost of their physical wellbeing. </p>
<p>The book is a walk in the life of the main character Seracill, they are a genderless being from a species of changelings. They search for companionship in a world full of people with ulterior motives. They face a suppressive church that controls the country they live in. They make all the right choices with all the wrong people on their quest to not be alone. They face their building insanity and the consequences and struggles it brings.  Will they find the company they have always searched for? Or will the world and their mind consume them before they get the chance?</p>

<h3>Who I Am</h3>
<p>I am the kind of girl who has always found joy in the escape a good book brings. It has been my dream for many years to write something that I felt was worth the world's attention, and finally I have written it. I am a 23 year old pansexual polyamorous transgender woman who is on the spectrum and suffers from mental illness. I myself have quested for love all my life, and until recently had given up hope on finding anything good for me. That was before I met my fiancé and my house mate. They showed me what true love is, and I myself saw the journey it takes to get there. It is not my dream to be a successful author, it is my dream to write things that others can get lost in like I did when I was younger, and finally I have. </p>
<p>You can contact me with questions or follow for regular updates on the progress being made in both book one and book two at either of the following addresses. </p>

<h3>What I Will Do With Your Money</h3>
<p>I am hoping to raise $900 to publish this book. This money will cover indiegogo's cut, go to commissioning local artists in the community to do supplemental images for the book of characters, scenes, creatures, and the calendar I designed for the world. The vast majority of the money will go towards commissioning artists. </p>
<p>Publishing costs: I will be publishing through a print on demand retailer and distributer, this eliminates the large up front cost of some publishing sites. </p>
<p>Copyright: Before you can publish you have to copyright your manuscript, this is going to cost $50. </p>
<p>ISBN: To purchase an ISBN for the book in each of the formats it will be offered, it will cost $295</p>
<p>Supplemental art: All money raised over the copyright and publishing costs will go towards commissioning local artists and creators to do artwork for the book, going back into the community.</p>
<p>If I do not reach my entire goal then publishing will be delayed until I can raise all of the remaining funds personally to make this the book it was meant to be. This will delay the delivery date of the project considerably. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Are Supporting Here</h3>
<p>This world needs more books that are LGBTQ inclusive, it helps show others that who we are is valid. My book is just that as I am within the community myself. Your contributions will not only help me achieve my dreams, they will help add to the art produced by our community. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>I have never published work before, but am in contact with people who have and have done extensive research to determine the best course to take. The greatest hurdle is actually writing the work to be published, and that is in the final editing stage already. </p>
<p>One of the biggest challenge is getting noticed in the industry. I have many avenues to spread word around about the book's release as well as to spread this campaign. Most of all word of mouth and personal sharing is the best way to reach new people, and I am counting on you all for help. </p>
<p>The second biggest challenge is the monetary investment, which is hopefully being solved by this campaign.  If it is not then I will be working hard anyway I can to raise the funds myself to see this through to the end.</p>
<p>Finally the current hurdle is getting the final edit and revision of the book completed and formatting it into a manuscript. I already have three editors working through the fourth draft which is already a third of the way completed.  Once they have finished editing it will be on me to polish it into a final draft then format it into a manuscript. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Another way to help is to please share this campaign to friends, family, and in community spaces. Every little bit of exposure helps. If you can't donate maybe someone you know can. Please share this to help get the word out. There are even built in tools on indiegogo to share to facebook!</p>
<h3>Updates</h3>
<p>For every $300 raised I will be posting a portion of a chapter from the book that includes no spoilers as an update.  This will be to help show the world I have already built that you are investing into, so keep an eye out!</p>
</div><h3>Special Thanks</h3><p>Header image is a portion of the cover design for the book, done by Zyra Taz. You can find her work at <a href=""http://www.zyra.us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.zyra.us</a></p></div>","What It Is About

I am a 23 year old pansexual polyamorous transgender woman who is on the spectrum and suffers from mental illness. I myself have quested for love all my life, and until recently had given up hope on finding anything good for me. That was before I met my fiancé and my house mate. They showed me what true love is, and I myself saw the journey it takes to get there. It is not my dream to be a successful author, it is my dream to write things that others can get lost in like I did when I was younger, and finally I have. 
You can contact me with questions or follow for regular updates on the progress being made in both book one and book two at either of the following addresses.

What I Will Do With Your Money
I am hoping to raise $900 to publish this book. This money will cover indiegogo's cut, go to commissioning local artists in the community to do supplemental images for the book of characters, scenes, creatures, and the calendar I designed for the world. The vast majority of the money will go towards commissioning artists. 
Publishing costs: I will be publishing through a print on demand retailer and distributer, this eliminates the large up front cost of some publishing sites. 
Copyright: Before you can publish you have to copyright your manuscript, this is going to cost $50. 
ISBN: To purchase an ISBN for the book in each of the formats it will be offered, it will cost $295
Supplemental art: All money raised over the copyright and publishing costs will go towards commissioning local artists and creators to do artwork for the book, going back into the community.
If I do not reach my entire goal then publishing will be delayed until I can raise all of the remaining funds personally to make this the book it was meant to be. This will delay the delivery date of the project considerably. 

What You Are Supporting Here
This world needs more books that are LGBTQ inclusive, it helps show others that who we are is valid. My book is just that as I am within the community myself. Your contributions will not only help me achieve my dreams, they will help add to the art produced by our community. 

Challenges
I have never published work before, but am in contact with people who have and have done extensive research to determine the best course to take. The greatest hurdle is actually writing the work to be published, and that is in the final editing stage already. 
One of the biggest challenge is getting noticed in the industry. I have many avenues to spread word around about the book's release as well as to spread this campaign. Most of all word of mouth and personal sharing is the best way to reach new people, and I am counting on you all for help. 
The second biggest challenge is the monetary investment, which is hopefully being solved by this campaign.  If it is not then I will be working hard anyway I can to raise the funds myself to see this through to the end.
Finally the current hurdle is getting the final edit and revision of the book completed and formatting it into a manuscript. I already have three editors working through the fourth draft which is already a third of the way completed.  Once they have finished editing it will be on me to polish it into a final draft then format it into a manuscript. 

Other Ways You Can Help
Another way to help is to please share this campaign to friends, family, and in community spaces. Every little bit of exposure helps. If you can't donate maybe someone you know can. Please share this to help get the word out. There are even built in tools on indiegogo to share to facebook!
Updates
For every $300 raised I will be posting a portion of a chapter from the book that includes no spoilers as an update.  This will be to help show the world I have already built that you are investing into, so keep an eye out!

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>My name is Jaime McDougall, and I am a US expat living in regional Australia. Like many, I have always loved stories - especially creating them. One of the first stories I wrote was a single page long and was about how my brother killed the world with a nuclear taco fart. It's been all uphill from there; I promise.</p>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks to a lot of help from some wonderful people, including my amazing teachers, this year I was able to work past health issues to start a professional writing and editing course at a local TAFE.

<div> </div>
<h3>The Project</h3>

<p>In
order for this third and final book to be as <b>professionally presented, edited, packaged, and promoted</b> as the first two, I urgently need to raise <b>$3,500</b>.</p>

NEW! - Cobweb Bride (book one) is FREE for the Holidays! Get it for free on Amazon Kindle, B&N Nook Book, Smashwords (various), Kobo, Sony, and Apple iTunes!
So you’ve read the first book of the trilogy, went a little
crazy—in a good way—then read book two, and really lost your heart—and now you are dying to find out what happens next! 
What will happen romantically between Percy and Beltain?
What about Claere and Vlau?
Who is the Cobweb Bride?
Why is the world fading?
Well, get ready—in Cobweb Forest the stakes are now
three times as high, and all the impossible mysteries will be answered at last! 
The world is broken... All death and dying has ceased...
A dark Goddess rises... One maiden must stop her.
And at last you meet the dark Lord of the Underworld Himself... Hades!
Empires clash, kings and emperors and gods vie for
supremacy, the living and the dead are at war, while love stories play out in
amazing directions... secrets of life and death are revealed... and all the answers are here at last....
I am currently in the middle of writing book three, Cobweb Forest, the conclusion of this amazing story, and I cannot wait to share it with you! 
If you liked the
first book, I promise you will love this one! And if you loved the second
book, now you will be blown away.

What's Needed & What You Get
Cobweb Forest is scheduled for release on December
25, 2013, Christmas Day, and I am sprinting to finish it in time. But all my resources are short! I desperately need your help! 
In
order for this third and final book to be as professionally presented, edited, packaged, and promoted as the first two, I urgently need to raise $3,500.
Your money will go toward:

Writing and office expenses
Copyediting
Editing
Final Cover design
Review Copies
Business Software monthly maintenance subscription
A new split ergonomic keyboard to replace my failing one.

Promotional and advertizing expenses.

The reward structure is very simple—for anyone who
contributes at least $5, you will receive a copy of the finished
ebook edition of Cobweb Forest in any ebook format of your choice.
That’s a $1 savings off the retail price.
In addition, all contributors will be variously acknowledged
inside the book!

$5 – Supporter
$10 – Patron
$25 – Benefactor
$30 and above – ""Catch Me Up"" Jackpot! ALL 3 BOOKS! (Complete Trilogy)

No need to contribute a huge amount, just $5 or a little
above will do. But of course if you really want to be generous in any amount, I
can only kiss you!
So that’s the fundraiser!
Short and sweet!
The Impact
Simply put, this will help me
bring the book to you as fast as possible, in the most professional
package.
It takes time and resources and sweat and basic work hours to make a book.
I am a full-time writer and publisher, and this is my day job.
Everyone needs to get paid for their
work, whether you are a factory worker, business person, an entertainer,
 a
computer programmer, a librarian, an accountant, a musician, a food 
industry worker, a contractor, a doctor, an artist, a teacher, a 
janitor, or a
writer.
Please help me help you start reading Cobweb Forest as soon as possible!
Other Ways You Can Help
Times are tough for everyone, and if you are unable to contribute with even a few bucks (believe me, I understand!), you can still help immensely, by spreading the word!

<p>In 1997, Michelle and Sini brought

punk bands used, they booked a month-long cross-country tour, with shows every
night in a different dive bar, art gallery, queer club, sushi restaurant, punk
basement, community space throughout the USA. Sister Spit’s Ramblin’ Roadshow
toured constantly between 1997 – 2000 with year-round regional jaunts building
up to the massive cross-country endeavor each August.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In 2007, Michelle Tea revived
Sister Spit as Sister Spit: The Next Generation. Having just edited an
anthology of new, young, queer writers she was looking to take some on tour.
She wanted to bring along some older Spit writers, and voila: a new generation
of Sister Spit was born. Since 2007 Sister Spit has staged one major tour each
year, bringing up-and-coming writers alongside their published, more
established peers. Sister Spit shows allow writers new and old to promote their
work to an audience they would not be able to access on their own. Books are
sold, fans are made, and new opportunities – Literary agents! Foreign
translations! – are seized.</span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/140828/files/20131018102903-66857_466011725517_3897390_n.jpg?1382117343"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>Sister Spit has come a long way
from the tours of the 90s, when sleeping on a stranger’s floor was the norm and
writers were paid $80 for a month of grueling, non-stop work. Nowadays we rent
our vehicles to be sure they are dependable – in the 90s, Sister Spit vans were
famous for catching fire in Nevada or outright dying in Mississippi. Now, We
stay in hotel rooms, making the rigors of touring a bit easier on the crew. And
we make a point to pay the writers for their work on the road and time away
from their jobs. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>Because Sister Spit makes a point
to travel not only to the big cities but also seeks smaller, underserved queer
populations, Sister Spit is able to provide audiences hungry for LGBTQ,
feminist, underground voices with a slew of new writers to read and watch out
for each year. By pairing up with local writers in many of these towns, local
writers get to be part of a really big show, and Sister Spit gets exposed to
even more new voices to work with in the future.</p>

<p>We are asking for community support
to help this tour be as successful and far-reaching as possible! By
contributing to Sister Spit, you make it possible for us to travel into cities
and towns that might not be able to fund the full cost to
put up our show. You make it possible for us to pay writers working their butts
off to support their art. You help sustain the work it takes to get the show on
the road – work that begins nine months before we roll into town.</p>

anthology of new, young, queer writers she was looking to take some on tour.
She wanted to bring along some older Spit writers, and voila: a new generation
of Sister Spit was born. Since 2007 Sister Spit has staged one major tour each
year, bringing up-and-coming writers alongside their published, more
established peers. Sister Spit shows allow writers new and old to promote their
work to an audience they would not be able to access on their own. Books are
sold, fans are made, and new opportunities – Literary agents! Foreign
translations! – are seized.

Sister Spit has come a long way
from the tours of the 90s, when sleeping on a stranger’s floor was the norm and
writers were paid $80 for a month of grueling, non-stop work. Nowadays we rent
our vehicles to be sure they are dependable – in the 90s, Sister Spit vans were
famous for catching fire in Nevada or outright dying in Mississippi. Now, We
stay in hotel rooms, making the rigors of touring a bit easier on the crew. And
we make a point to pay the writers for their work on the road and time away
from their jobs. 
Because Sister Spit makes a point
to travel not only to the big cities but also seeks smaller, underserved queer
populations, Sister Spit is able to provide audiences hungry for LGBTQ,
feminist, underground voices with a slew of new writers to read and watch out
for each year. By pairing up with local writers in many of these towns, local
writers get to be part of a really big show, and Sister Spit gets exposed to
even more new voices to work with in the future.

We are asking for community support
to help this tour be as successful and far-reaching as possible! By
contributing to Sister Spit, you make it possible for us to travel into cities
and towns that might not be able to fund the full cost to
put up our show. You make it possible for us to pay writers working their butts
off to support their art. You help sustain the work it takes to get the show on
the road – work that begins nine months before we roll into town.

Providing right livelihood resources to help writers and artists in this emerging field make a living from their calling and work in service to their communities


The Network organizes the Power of Words conference; has published The Power of Words: A Transformative Language Arts Reader, the first study of TLA in theory and practice; distributes resources on TLA and Right Livelihood; and this spring we’re launching on-line classes, with offerings on writing and healing, poetry, ecology and art, and support for poets, writers, storytellers, and performers who want to develop skills that help them move toward make a living through arts-based community projects. This spring we want to get materials ready for a summer launch of our next endeavor: the One City One Prompt Project.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Do you realize that many of our “rights” are not actually mentioned in the Constitution?  For example, it says nothing explicitly about the right to marry or to have, or not have, any children.  While most of these rights are not controversial and we take them for granted every day, several were once restricted or prohibited by laws that had to be challenged in court.  These include the right have a job, to travel from state to state, to attend a private school, to learn a foreign language, to live with your grandchildren, and even to choose your child’s own name! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am Mark Thorburn and I am a freelance writer and the author of six books.  With graduate degrees (and a strong personal interest) in both history and the law, I want to write and self-publish a book about the court cases that have dealt with many of the rights not expressly mentioned in the Constitution.  My goal is to discuss the important and interesting decisions in a light, yet informative, way so that everyone can pick up the book and, after only ten or fifteen minutes, learn something about the history and development of our civil liberties and how judges decide constitutional disputes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The book, <em>You Have the Right . . . :  Constitutional Rights That Are Not Mentioned in the Constitution!</em>, will summarize the background and results of each of these fascinating cases in short, 750 to 1500 word chapters.  (Just to give you an idea – this profile is about 750 words long.)  The final, paperback edition will cover between 30 and 40 cases in approximately 200 pages.  Give me a shout if you want more information of what I have in mind.  I also intend to put the book out in an e-book edition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>You Have the Right . . .</em>  will be perfect for elementary and high school civics and history courses.  Lawyers and schools can use the book as a contest prize or giveaway at Bill of Rights Day and Law Day events.  It will be a great read for those with short periods of time to kill (like when sitting on a bus or in a waiting room).  Everyone interested in American history or the law will want a copy.  And I hope to eventually find <em>You Have the Right . . .</em>  in as many school, college and public libraries as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You might be wondering why I’m self-publishing.   Quite simply, all of my previous books were written on a contract basis and that had many negatives, including payment by flat fee (no share in profits) and lack of control (no say in how to design or promote the work).  Dealing with a publisher who pays their authors with royalties involves even more problems, including a significant lag time in production (up to one year).  Self-publishing is a lot faster, I retain full control over all aspects of the production and marketing of my work, and I get a bigger share of the profits. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have already spent seven months on research and am now ready to put pen to paper, <strong><em>but I need your help!</em></strong> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I want to devote myself full-time to the writing of the book so I can complete the manuscript in three months.  Otherwise, I’ll have to work on it bit by bit on weekends and evenings for a year or more.  Writing full-time means giving up my other job as a tutor and foregoing other writing assignments.  Unfortunately, I’m not independently wealthy.  Additionally, after completing the manuscript, another two months will be needed for those tasks that are required to create and market a book, like hire a professional editor and typesetter, design a cover, convert everything into an e-book, ISBN and Library of Congress registration, establish a website, and so on, all of which is not cheap.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The planned release date for the book is April 1, 2013 (just in time for Law Day!).  If I do not reach my $10,000 goal by Sunday, November 4, 2012, I will continue with the project as best I can and use the money collected to publish the best book possible over a longer period.  But the more funds I collect for this project, the sooner I can finish it and the higher quality product I can provide (sturdier paper, binding, etc.).</p>

<p><em>There, on the backside of the tree, Marigold found a ladder, and on the front side of the tree, a slide. She ran up the limbs of the tree and slid down to its roots. She ran round and round the waist of the tree, and swung far from its trunk in the air.</em></p>
<p><em>At the center, she found a hollow opening, just her size, and climbed deep in to the heart of the tree. From there, she could only hear her own thoughts, twirling and swirling like dry, fall leaves. </em></p>

<p><em>“Once upon a time, I was a seedling. I was born to a big family of trees. We lived in a perfect row at a hilltop overlooking a great valley. One day, a strong gust of wind came, and carried me away from everything I knew. I tumbled for days through the air and landed in this place where I am now far- faraway from any trees at all.”</em></p>

Dear Supporters, 
If you know me, you know that I love to deliver stories into the world- and not just any stories, but stories with heart-
My first children's book, Marigold and the Faraway Tree, is a coming of age story of a nine-year-old girl, whose relationship with an old tree guides her through an important season in her life.
I have always been fascinated by the stage in which children awaken to their ""inner world"", and with that come the responsibility to develop emotional intelligence, sensitivity to others, and a connection to Nature and Spirit.
This story was inspired by the true life presence of a Faraway Tree that stands at Imhoff Farm on the backside of the Blue Water Café, next door to the Higgeldy Piggeldy Farmyard in Kommetjie, close to the southern most tip of Africa known as Cape Point.
I like to think that the best stories originate in our own back yards and help us to see ordinary things, like a town, a character, or the turning of the seasons, through the lens of imagination, as a point of wonder and curiosity. And I think it's important to keep that perspective, as we grow older. 
Marigold and the Faraway Tree is the first book I wrote, nearly two years ago now, and it was so effortless, I found myself writing more... and more...
My intention is to publish and read these stories the old fashioned way to my nieces and nephews, to my friends and their children when I visit, and to produce a series of such stories under the publishing title, Sugar Plum Press.

Marigold & the Faraway Tree
(excerpt) 
There, on the backside of the tree, Marigold found a ladder, and on the front side of the tree, a slide. She ran up the limbs of the tree and slid down to its roots. She ran round and round the waist of the tree, and swung far from its trunk in the air.
At the center, she found a hollow opening, just her size, and climbed deep in to the heart of the tree. From there, she could only hear her own thoughts, twirling and swirling like dry, fall leaves. 
When her thoughts settled, the tree spoke. He told her the story of how he became the Faraway Tree.
“Once upon a time, I was a seedling. I was born to a big family of trees. We lived in a perfect row at a hilltop overlooking a great valley. One day, a strong gust of wind came, and carried me away from everything I knew. I tumbled for days through the air and landed in this place where I am now far- faraway from any trees at all.”
""Although,"" the tree paused, ""now that you've come to play with me, I don't feel far at all.""

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Andy Littleton and I'm a small church pastor and small business owner in Tucson, Arizona. I'm also the proud son of Leroy Littleton, a man who never would have led a public organization or started a business. He never would have been invited to speak at a conference. He was quiet and unassuming. You had to try really hard to get information out of him. But he was an amazing dad. He died of cancer last year, and my family and I miss him dearly.</p>
<p>I want to share out of the depths of what he instilled in me. I began to write about him, and sense that he offers a perspective on life and faith in God that may be far more helpful and accessible than that being dished out by people like me...people who come across like they have something to say and know how to say it. You can help me do this. This summer I'll embark on a journey of remembering, pen and paper in hand. Within a year The Little Man will be written, and you can can learn and share the insights left upon the world by a man that nobody realized they should listen to.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I've discovered that I write best as my memory is jogged. Some things were themes in my dad's life; trains (he lived in a box car as a kid), walking, the town of Bisbee, Oregon, his hobbies, road trips, his old Fords, my mom, and his son. So this summer I plan to write out of those experiences during a sabbatical my church has graciously offered. Here's what I'll do...</p>
<p>-Take a train from Tucson to Oregon (I have a place to stay for free in Portland).</p>
<p>-Walk to and from Lebanon, Oregon (Where I grew up, and where my dad lived his young adult years and met my mom). </p>
<p>-Drive home an old F-250 just like his.</p>
<p>All the while I'll be writing out of my experiences and memories. Then I'll get the manuscript edited and make print copies available for you and anyone else who connects with the journey.</p>
<p>The Breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm shooting for $5000 to help fund the trip (on a shoe-string budget!!), get design work done for the book, cover editing / publishing costs, and promote the project.</li>
<li>To sweeten the deal for those who support this project, I am offering some very Leroy perks! Beyond supplying you with a finished copy of the book I will also be offering the following; Photos (by my dad or I) framed with wood from his shop, concrete Ford F-250 home decorations, made in USA flannels that I find for you in thrift stores, a reading party, and even a trip with me in the F-250 to Bisbee.</li>
<li>If I don't reach the entire goal, I'm still committed to this project. It's a labor of love. I'll apply all funds I raise toward these goals and adjust as necessary.</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

This year I have Sabbatical time to use, but need to use it well in order to tune-in and really walk through these memories and experiences. My hope in writing this book during a focused trip, is to keep me deeply engaged in the process and undistracted from the regular needs within my community. I reflect well while writing, so the process itself will be an exercise of care for my soul. I believe that I can offer something of meaning out of stepping away to create this book about my dad.</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Overlapping Worlds</i> is an exploration of how nature can play a role in strengthening, reinforcing, and maintaining strong mental health in elite athletes. Not only does this book look through the unique lens of nature as a psychological wonder it also examines the stigmas that surround mental health in athletic communities and seeks to advocate for more open and honest conversation.<br/><br/>My name is Olivia Grace Barnes and I am the author of <i>Overlapping Worlds</i>. I wrote this book because as a competitive athlete who has struggled with mental health issues, I felt called to speak up, not only for current athletes like myself but also for any future athletes who might struggle. Also, being a born nature lover, I was inspired to share the wondrous powers that nature can have on the mind; connecting the worlds of mental health, sports, and nature into a colorful overlap.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to embrace the subject of mental illness within your community and learn how to appreciate and experience being in nature more fully. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for nature loving and mental health advocacy. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you become not only a better person, both mentally and physically, but also a pillar of support for anyone in need.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the stigmas that surround mental health and how nature can affect your mind. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>The thought process of Olympic track star Michael Marsh during one of his most memorable races.</li>
<li>Mental health advocate Victoria Garrick’s journey through her athletic mental struggles that eventually gave way to her widely viewed TED Talk.</li>
<li>Nature expert Ronna Schneberger’s insight into the power of being “nature-wise.”</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you enjoy sports, respect nature, and desire a change in how mental health is viewed and approached.<br/><br/><i>Overlapping Worlds</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to elite and competitive athletes who want to look at mental health and nature in a new way.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - <i>Overlapping Worlds</i>
</h3>
<p>The book is written in 4 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the Introduction and Chapters 1 - 4. In the introduction, you will get a glimpse into one of the most memorable stories within this book, my first encounter with wild dolphins. Then, in Chapters 1 - 4, three athletes from different levels and backgrounds illustrate the mental side of competition as we look into what goes on in the minds of elite athletes as they train, compete, and prepare for greatness.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains Chapters 5 - 9, the part of the book where we start our dive into mental health advocacy. In exploring the stigmas that surround mental illness in athletic communities, these chapters seek to uproot those ideas and inspire open and supportive conversations around mental health struggles. These chapters are also filled with quotes and stories from Brené Brown, Michael Phelps, and other inspiring athletes and mental health advocates.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains Chapters 10 - 12 and looks in depth at the topic of environmental psychology. Along with the stories and experiences of two incredible researchers, this section explores how nature affects the mind and why it has the power to make such a positive impact on our mental health. It is in these chapters that I share the story of my encounter with wild dolphins.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> contains Chapters 13 - 15 and the Conclusion. It is in this final section that we examine the overlap between mental health, sports, and nature. Connecting dots from previous parts and chapters, we return again to the minds of athletes, but this time focus on how athletes react to spending quality time in nature. As the book comes to a close, we complete the circle of exploration into how nature can play a role in strengthening the mental health of elite athletes.<br/> </p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Olivia Grace Barnes is a rising senior in high school with a long-standing love for and appreciation of nature, a strong voice, an inspiring desire to lead, and an impressive resume of achievements from being a nationally competitive swimmer.<br/><br/>Olivia’s passions have long included both competitive sport and spending time in nature, but it wasn’t until she experienced a mental health struggle herself that she became interested in that field of study as well. As she began to realize that there was room for positive impact in the overlap of sports, nature, and mental health, she decided to speak up to try to make a change.<br/><br/>After leaving traditional high school for something called self-directed learning, Olivia is what many might call a high-school dropout. Although she might not take traditional classes in a traditional school setting, she still continues to spend her time learning about things such as marine conservation, wildlife photography, and what it takes to become an elite athlete.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Olivia at oliviabarnesinc@gmail.com and on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivia-barnes-59617a200/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LinkedIn</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/o_grace_b/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a></p>

</div></div>","Story of My Book
Overlapping Worlds is an exploration of how nature can play a role in strengthening, reinforcing, and maintaining strong mental health in elite athletes. Not only does this book look through the unique lens of nature as a psychological wonder it also examines the stigmas that surround mental health in athletic communities and seeks to advocate for more open and honest conversation.My name is Olivia Grace Barnes and I am the author of Overlapping Worlds. I wrote this book because as a competitive athlete who has struggled with mental health issues, I felt called to speak up, not only for current athletes like myself but also for any future athletes who might struggle. Also, being a born nature lover, I was inspired to share the wondrous powers that nature can have on the mind; connecting the worlds of mental health, sports, and nature into a colorful overlap.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to embrace the subject of mental illness within your community and learn how to appreciate and experience being in nature more fully. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for nature loving and mental health advocacy. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you become not only a better person, both mentally and physically, but also a pillar of support for anyone in need.In this book, you'll learn about the stigmas that surround mental health and how nature can affect your mind. You'll hear stories such as...

The thought process of Olympic track star Michael Marsh during one of his most memorable races.
Mental health advocate Victoria Garrick’s journey through her athletic mental struggles that eventually gave way to her widely viewed TED Talk.
Nature expert Ronna Schneberger’s insight into the power of being “nature-wise.”

You will love this book if you enjoy sports, respect nature, and desire a change in how mental health is viewed and approached.Overlapping Worlds is a nonfiction book that speaks to elite and competitive athletes who want to look at mental health and nature in a new way.
 
The Book - Overlapping Worlds

The book is written in 4 parts.Part 1 contains the Introduction and Chapters 1 - 4. In the introduction, you will get a glimpse into one of the most memorable stories within this book, my first encounter with wild dolphins. Then, in Chapters 1 - 4, three athletes from different levels and backgrounds illustrate the mental side of competition as we look into what goes on in the minds of elite athletes as they train, compete, and prepare for greatness.Part 2 contains Chapters 5 - 9, the part of the book where we start our dive into mental health advocacy. In exploring the stigmas that surround mental illness in athletic communities, these chapters seek to uproot those ideas and inspire open and supportive conversations around mental health struggles. These chapters are also filled with quotes and stories from Brené Brown, Michael Phelps, and other inspiring athletes and mental health advocates.Part 3 contains Chapters 10 - 12 and looks in depth at the topic of environmental psychology. Along with the stories and experiences of two incredible researchers, this section explores how nature affects the mind and why it has the power to make such a positive impact on our mental health. It is in these chapters that I share the story of my encounter with wild dolphins.Part 4 contains Chapters 13 - 15 and the Conclusion. It is in this final section that we examine the overlap between mental health, sports, and nature. Connecting dots from previous parts and chapters, we return again to the minds of athletes, but this time focus on how athletes react to spending quality time in nature. As the book comes to a close, we complete the circle of exploration into how nature can play a role in strengthening the mental health of elite athletes.

About the Author
Olivia Grace Barnes is a rising senior in high school with a long-standing love for and appreciation of nature, a strong voice, an inspiring desire to lead, and an impressive resume of achievements from being a nationally competitive swimmer.Olivia’s passions have long included both competitive sport and spending time in nature, but it wasn’t until she experienced a mental health struggle herself that she became interested in that field of study as well. As she began to realize that there was room for positive impact in the overlap of sports, nature, and mental health, she decided to speak up to try to make a change.After leaving traditional high school for something called self-directed learning, Olivia is what many might call a high-school dropout. Although she might not take traditional classes in a traditional school setting, she still continues to spend her time learning about things such as marine conservation, wildlife photography, and what it takes to become an elite athlete.For more information, you can connect with Olivia at oliviabarnesinc@gmail.com and on LinkedIn and Instagram

</div><p><b>KUNG HINDI NGAYON,
KAILAN? KUNG HINDI SIYA, SINO?</b></p>
<p>A movement is now in progress. The movement seeks to field Davao City
Mayor Rodrigo Duterte as a presidential candidate in 2016. There is, of course,
some doubts about the movement. No mayor has ever made the long jump from City
Hall to Malacañang. In fact, no one has yet made a successful leap from
Mindanao to the presidential palace by the Pasig River, not to this day.</p>
<p>We need FUNDING to keep this going.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Facebook reaches 30 million users in the Philippines. With the current
move of the cellular network companies (Globe, Sun, Smart) to give mobile users
free access to Facebook, this is easily the best medium to reach the masses.</p>
<p>The campaign to promote the Facebook page ""Duterte for
President"" and get the message out costs around PHP 11,000 per day. The
page currently have 32000 followers. There are currently 52 million registered
voters in the Philippines. Our goal is to reach at least 10 million followers.
Hopefully, the good Mayor hears these 10 million  voices and decide to run
for the presidency which many of us believe that is the only way forward for
the Philippines.</p>
<p>The Presidential election for is on May 4, 2016. Mayor Duterte can file
for candidacy at least 90 days before this date. If the facebook page is
promoted for at least a year (365 days), we need at least PHP 4 million.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Where this advocacy is coming from does not astonish. It is not
difficult to see that it is coming from a groundswell of despair over the
systematic thievery by government officials of pork barrel funds. It may also
be coming from chronic fatigue from the endless, divisive bickering among
politicians.</p>
<p>The issues currently hounding the Binays of Makati only add fuel to the
fire. The use of dummy companies is standard operating procedure among many
local executives who—no mystery here—bask in the lifestyles of the rich and
famous. In many town and cities, local government does not function
effectively. In some others, there does not seem to be any government at all.
The same is true in many barangays—where peoples’ money trickles down to the
Sangguniang Kabataan, which has made thievery part of the youth’s political
training.</p>
<p>What people see in Davao City is the exact opposite. Out there, even
ordinary citizens reprimand those violating the smoking ban. And the mayor’s
daughter gets apprehended for violating the city’s speed limit regulations.</p>
<p>We truly believe that Mayor Duterte is the answer to this growing
desperation. IF WE SUCCEED, THE FRUITS ARE NOT ONLY FOR US BUT FOR THE NEXT
GENERATIONS TO COME.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>There will be, doubters, haters and skeptics.</p>
<p>Here is our manifesto:</p>
<p>We promise to be transparent with the funds and use it only to promote
the advocacy it was created for. We will post the details of the funds and how
it is used.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Some of us just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean we can't help.
Please share the facebook page ""Duterte for President"" to all your friends and loved ones. Get the word out and make some noise about our
campaign.</p>
<p>Together we can make this happen!</p>

We need FUNDING to keep this going.
What We Need & What You Get
Facebook reaches 30 million users in the Philippines. With the current
move of the cellular network companies (Globe, Sun, Smart) to give mobile users
free access to Facebook, this is easily the best medium to reach the masses.
The campaign to promote the Facebook page ""Duterte for
President"" and get the message out costs around PHP 11,000 per day. The
page currently have 32000 followers. There are currently 52 million registered
voters in the Philippines. Our goal is to reach at least 10 million followers.
Hopefully, the good Mayor hears these 10 million  voices and decide to run
for the presidency which many of us believe that is the only way forward for
the Philippines.
The Presidential election for is on May 4, 2016. Mayor Duterte can file
for candidacy at least 90 days before this date. If the facebook page is
promoted for at least a year (365 days), we need at least PHP 4 million.
The Impact
Where this advocacy is coming from does not astonish. It is not
difficult to see that it is coming from a groundswell of despair over the
systematic thievery by government officials of pork barrel funds. It may also
be coming from chronic fatigue from the endless, divisive bickering among
politicians.
The issues currently hounding the Binays of Makati only add fuel to the
fire. The use of dummy companies is standard operating procedure among many
local executives who—no mystery here—bask in the lifestyles of the rich and
famous. In many town and cities, local government does not function
effectively. In some others, there does not seem to be any government at all.
The same is true in many barangays—where peoples’ money trickles down to the
Sangguniang Kabataan, which has made thievery part of the youth’s political
training.
What people see in Davao City is the exact opposite. Out there, even
ordinary citizens reprimand those violating the smoking ban. And the mayor’s
daughter gets apprehended for violating the city’s speed limit regulations.
We truly believe that Mayor Duterte is the answer to this growing
desperation. IF WE SUCCEED, THE FRUITS ARE NOT ONLY FOR US BUT FOR THE NEXT
GENERATIONS TO COME.
Risks & Challenges
There will be, doubters, haters and skeptics.
Here is our manifesto:
We promise to be transparent with the funds and use it only to promote
the advocacy it was created for. We will post the details of the funds and how
it is used.
Other Ways You Can Help
Some of us just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean we can't help.
Please share the facebook page ""Duterte for President"" to all your friends and loved ones. Get the word out and make some noise about our
campaign.
Together we can make this happen!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h2><p></p><p></p>
<p>I allowed misperceptions and fear to be my culprit in
life. </p>
<p>As fear ran and stuck on me like wax dripping down a
candlestick and misperceptions stunted my spiritual growth, I started feeling lost
and frustrated.  I began to isolate
myself and became a secret keeper - trying to live with what I could no longer
bear.  Women are known to be good at
keeping secrets, without realizing that the enemy uses it to disgrace and
demoralize our minds and block us from trusting and hearing God's voice.  By becoming the secret keeper and allowing misperceptions to become the culprit in my life, I wounded myself losing trust and
becoming blind to reality.  The solution:
I surrendered to God!</p>
<p>Unsure when it really began, I now identify the dissolution of
my marriage as one of the first changes that led to a downward spiral in my life. 
As I transitioned from being married to becoming a single mother my
desires changed.  I longed to be ever present in my children’s lives.  I wanted
to shield and protect them even more. 
Having acknowledged that meant I was in need of rescue.  In order for me
to save them, I had to be saved myself.  I needed to realign myself with God and
allow only those in my life who chose to know, live and love Him.  Understanding this would allow me to demonstrate Godly character, love, work ethic and discipline for my children.  I then became an example for them.</p>
<p></p><p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/464263/files/20140327082710-breast_cancer.jpg?1395934030"" src="""" style=""width: 321.918px; height: 208px;""/></p>However, the present moment of my spiritual journey was
manipulated.  It wasn't until I began a dance with breast cancer
that I realized I was not leading. Cancer decided to snatch the sound of
sweet melodies from my life and rip the strings that tied together my unsung
songs. I became so broken and shook up to the point that I could not call out
to God.  It shut my heart down and I suffered over the apparent imperfections of life.  But that was only the first dance.
Eventually, a second dance with cancer ensued and this time around I submitted
to a new leader.  God was in control and helped me understand that He had been
leading the dance all along. <p></p>
<p>My life completely changed. I continued to try to
maintain a way of living that would sustain and reward my children for a life
that they so deserved.  Gracious family
members and friends stood in when I could not stand at all.  At times I found myself doubting my
capabilities of not only taking care of my children but myself also.  I still carried on an air that I was so okay,
confident and not becoming a display.  At
that time in my life I really thought I had lost more than I gained.  <br/></p><p></p>My situation forced me to give up things -
not the things I wanted to have but the things I needed.  I decided that my life had become more worthy
for my children's sake and they became my strength. Scripture says that God
does not give us any more than we can bear (1 Corinthians 10:13), but at that time I felt I had hit
rock bottom.  But there was hope.  I held on to my vision and desire to change
what was happening to me and my family. Now I know that nothing that I have been through
will be wasted.<br/><p></p>
<p></p><p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/464410/files/20140327090541-God_hope.jpg?1395936341"" src="""" style=""width: 267.616px; height: 264px;""/></p>In spite of it all, with everything that was spinning in
my life, I was able to go through the fire cringing, weeping, broken, empty,
enduring and even losing everything.  But
this was only the beginning of my spiritual journey.  I became encouraged as I began to meet women
that felt comfortable just sharing openly with me about their lives.  These women taught me more about the love of
God and His word. In spite of it all, God granted me grace while I was in the
fire! God sent me what I needed, through   <div>                                                                       creative women, to connect directly to
Him.  <p></p>
<p>You will read many of these women’s stories in the
magazine. Their untold stories spoke to me as I know they will to you.  They will take you to a place in your life
that maybe you could never really talk about. 
As you embrace these creative musings they will empower, encourage and
inspire your soul.  <i><b>In Spite of It All Magazine</b></i>  captures the essence of women all over and gives them hope! </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Giving Back to the Community</h2>
<p>Yes, there are other inspirational magazines already out there, but <i><b>In Spite of It All Magazine</b></i> IS different. It springs from a well of collective spiritual experiences shared by women everywhere resulting in a magazine that not only inspires, but provides the healing balm necessary to transcend a broken spirit.  In addition to uplifting and inspiring others through articles, poetry, art, and short fiction, we believe in sharing in a real world sense as well.  That’s why it is our intent to share a portion of the profits to help others haunted by the demons of past hurts, habits, and hang-ups. <br/></p>

<li>One is a Columbia, SC faith based organization helping single mothers in transition rebuild their lives. These women come from all walks of life. The program fosters a sense of hope by 
showing women how to break the destructive cycle of chronic 
poverty.  It works by responding to the emotional, physical, and spiritual 
needs of the women and children in resident.</li>
<li>The other is a Durham, NC faith based non-profit that has developed a manhood training program utilizing mentoring, counseling and self-development skills to help young men successfully transition into adulthood. It instills self-esteem and confidence while reinforcing a positive concept of manhood. With an emphasis on faith, the program teaches responsibility, respect for women, education, positive work ethics, and respect for cultural diversity.</li>

<p><br/></p>
<h3>Here’s how your funds will be used to support the launch of <b><i>In Spite of It All</i></b> Magazine:</h3>
<p><b>Domain name and hosting</b></p>
<p>We've actually already registered the domain name – <b><i>inspiteofItallmag.com</i></b>. In addition, we‘ll need hosting capable of handling multimedia as the magazine will also have an electronic version online.</p>
<p><b>Software</b></p>
<p>We'll need software for laying out, designing, and publishing the print magazine. We’ll also need to purchase and implement software that will allow us to establish an electronic version of the magazine. In addition, we'll need to implement membership capabilities on the website. We’ll also need email software to keep in touch with our subscribers.</p>
<p><b>Website design</b></p>
<p>Yes! We purchased a domain name, but that’s only the first step. We will to hire need an experienced web designer to breathe life into our vision. We've managed to accomplish many things, but web design is definitely NOT our strong suit.</p>
<p><b>Writers / Contributors</b></p>
<p>Good writers are worth their weight in gold. Therefore, we will need to pay writers to ensure you are receiving a quality product each month. We need writers who can draw you in and keep you inspired. <br/></p>
<p>With that being said, we invite you to share your own personal spiritual experiences to help uplift and inspire others who are 'going through'. If you are interested in contributing to <i><b>In Spite of It All Magazine</b></i>, please email us your ideas for article, poetry, short fiction, or inspirational art. You may find yourself featured in an upcoming issue.<br/></p>
<p><b>Editorial staff</b></p>
<p>Along with writers, every magazine needs an editorial staff. After all, who wants to read a poorly laid out magazine full of spelling and grammar errors? Though we’ll be using high quality writers, we still need experienced editors to make sure <b><i>In Spite of It All Magazine</i></b> is everything we envisioned for you.</p>
<p><b>Social media manager</b></p>
<p>We've established a basic social media presence at Facebook, Twitter, and Google. We’re in the process of getting our LinkedIn account set up as well. However, managing social media is a demanding job. We are finding we will soon need a dedicated person to help us grow and to get the word out.</p>
<p><b>Graphic designer</b> </p>
<p>The need for quality graphics is immense. We are constantly networking in the community and need quality graphics for professional correspondence and more. In addition, we will also need to hire a dedicated graphic designer for layout once we have everything in place.</p>
<p><b>Printing</b></p>
<p>Whew! Printing is expensive! Once we have actually laid out the first issue, we’ll need to source a printer to produce the physical magazine.</p>
<p><b>Mailing Costs</b></p>
<p>And of course, we will need to pay postage costs for mailing the magazine to subscribers. We'll also need to mail all those wonderful perks to you once the campaign has ended. Mailing definitely is NOT cheap these days.</p>
<p><b>Miscellaneous</b></p>
<p>This is by no means and exhaustive list of everything we’ll need to properly launch In Spite of It All. However, it will sure go a long way in getting us started. There will definitely be other miscellaneous costs associated with producing the magazine.</p>

demoralize our minds and block us from trusting and hearing God's voice.  By becoming the secret keeper and allowing misperceptions to become the culprit in my life, I wounded myself losing trust and
becoming blind to reality.  The solution:
I surrendered to God!
Unsure when it really began, I now identify the dissolution of
my marriage as one of the first changes that led to a downward spiral in my life. 
As I transitioned from being married to becoming a single mother my
desires changed.  I longed to be ever present in my children’s lives.  I wanted
to shield and protect them even more. 
Having acknowledged that meant I was in need of rescue.  In order for me
to save them, I had to be saved myself.  I needed to realign myself with God and
allow only those in my life who chose to know, live and love Him.  Understanding this would allow me to demonstrate Godly character, love, work ethic and discipline for my children.  I then became an example for them.
However, the present moment of my spiritual journey was
manipulated.  It wasn't until I began a dance with breast cancer
that I realized I was not leading. Cancer decided to snatch the sound of
sweet melodies from my life and rip the strings that tied together my unsung
songs. I became so broken and shook up to the point that I could not call out
to God.  It shut my heart down and I suffered over the apparent imperfections of life.  But that was only the first dance.
Eventually, a second dance with cancer ensued and this time around I submitted
to a new leader.  God was in control and helped me understand that He had been
leading the dance all along. 
My life completely changed. I continued to try to
maintain a way of living that would sustain and reward my children for a life
that they so deserved.  Gracious family
members and friends stood in when I could not stand at all.  At times I found myself doubting my
capabilities of not only taking care of my children but myself also.  I still carried on an air that I was so okay,
confident and not becoming a display.  At
that time in my life I really thought I had lost more than I gained.  My situation forced me to give up things -
not the things I wanted to have but the things I needed.  I decided that my life had become more worthy
for my children's sake and they became my strength. Scripture says that God
does not give us any more than we can bear (1 Corinthians 10:13), but at that time I felt I had hit
rock bottom.  But there was hope.  I held on to my vision and desire to change
what was happening to me and my family. Now I know that nothing that I have been through
will be wasted.
In spite of it all, with everything that was spinning in
my life, I was able to go through the fire cringing, weeping, broken, empty,
enduring and even losing everything.  But
this was only the beginning of my spiritual journey.  I became encouraged as I began to meet women
that felt comfortable just sharing openly with me about their lives.  These women taught me more about the love of
God and His word. In spite of it all, God granted me grace while I was in the
fire! God sent me what I needed, through                                                                          creative women, to connect directly to
Him.  
You will read many of these women’s stories in the
magazine. Their untold stories spoke to me as I know they will to you.  They will take you to a place in your life
that maybe you could never really talk about. 
As you embrace these creative musings they will empower, encourage and
inspire your soul.  In Spite of It All Magazine  captures the essence of women all over and gives them hope! 


Giving Back to the Community
Yes, there are other inspirational magazines already out there, but In Spite of It All Magazine IS different. It springs from a well of collective spiritual experiences shared by women everywhere resulting in a magazine that not only inspires, but provides the healing balm necessary to transcend a broken spirit.  In addition to uplifting and inspiring others through articles, poetry, art, and short fiction, we believe in sharing in a real world sense as well.  That’s why it is our intent to share a portion of the profits to help others haunted by the demons of past hurts, habits, and hang-ups. 

Initially, we are collaborating with two regional non-profit organizations making a difference in the community:
One is a Columbia, SC faith based organization helping single mothers in transition rebuild their lives. These women come from all walks of life. The program fosters a sense of hope by 
showing women how to break the destructive cycle of chronic 
poverty.  It works by responding to the emotional, physical, and spiritual 
needs of the women and children in resident.
The other is a Durham, NC faith based non-profit that has developed a manhood training program utilizing mentoring, counseling and self-development skills to help young men successfully transition into adulthood. It instills self-esteem and confidence while reinforcing a positive concept of manhood. With an emphasis on faith, the program teaches responsibility, respect for women, education, positive work ethics, and respect for cultural diversity.

We Need Your Help

  Launching a brand new magazine is a massive undertaking and we need your help and support along the way. We’re estimating that we’ll need at least $25,000 to get this unique project off the ground. Keep in mind this is a frugal estimate and we welcome all the support we can get. Remember, not only will you be helping us launch
the magazine, but you’ll be making a difference in the community too! 


Here’s how your funds will be used to support the launch of In Spite of It All Magazine:
Domain name and hosting
We've actually already registered the domain name – inspiteofItallmag.com. In addition, we‘ll need hosting capable of handling multimedia as the magazine will also have an electronic version online.
Software
We'll need software for laying out, designing, and publishing the print magazine. We’ll also need to purchase and implement software that will allow us to establish an electronic version of the magazine. In addition, we'll need to implement membership capabilities on the website. We’ll also need email software to keep in touch with our subscribers.
Website design
Yes! We purchased a domain name, but that’s only the first step. We will to hire need an experienced web designer to breathe life into our vision. We've managed to accomplish many things, but web design is definitely NOT our strong suit.
Writers / Contributors
Good writers are worth their weight in gold. Therefore, we will need to pay writers to ensure you are receiving a quality product each month. We need writers who can draw you in and keep you inspired. 
With that being said, we invite you to share your own personal spiritual experiences to help uplift and inspire others who are 'going through'. If you are interested in contributing to In Spite of It All Magazine, please email us your ideas for article, poetry, short fiction, or inspirational art. You may find yourself featured in an upcoming issue.
Editorial staff
Along with writers, every magazine needs an editorial staff. After all, who wants to read a poorly laid out magazine full of spelling and grammar errors? Though we’ll be using high quality writers, we still need experienced editors to make sure In Spite of It All Magazine is everything we envisioned for you.
Social media manager
We've established a basic social media presence at Facebook, Twitter, and Google. We’re in the process of getting our LinkedIn account set up as well. However, managing social media is a demanding job. We are finding we will soon need a dedicated person to help us grow and to get the word out.
Graphic designer 
The need for quality graphics is immense. We are constantly networking in the community and need quality graphics for professional correspondence and more. In addition, we will also need to hire a dedicated graphic designer for layout once we have everything in place.
Printing
Whew! Printing is expensive! Once we have actually laid out the first issue, we’ll need to source a printer to produce the physical magazine.
Mailing Costs
And of course, we will need to pay postage costs for mailing the magazine to subscribers. We'll also need to mail all those wonderful perks to you once the campaign has ended. Mailing definitely is NOT cheap these days.
Miscellaneous
This is by no means and exhaustive list of everything we’ll need to properly launch In Spite of It All. However, it will sure go a long way in getting us started. There will definitely be other miscellaneous costs associated with producing the magazine.

of In Spite of It All Magazine. As a small token of thanks, we are offering several perks for

</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>AHHHHH! I got a scholarship to BinderCon! I'M SO EXCITED!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>So... What is BinderCon?</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>BinderCon is a conference aimed at increasing the diversity of voices in the media by empowering women and gender non-conforming writers with tools, connections, and strategies to advance their careers. You can learn more about it <a href=""http://nyc.bindercon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. </div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">My scholarship gives me access to two full days of panels, workshops, and networking events where I'll have the chance to pitch to (or at least make awkward chit chat with) editors and agents. I even get to attend their VIP party which gives me more opportunities to mingle with my fellow writers and social betters.</span>
</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I'll get to learn from amazing writers and editors like <a href=""http://nyc.bindercon.com/speaker/suzy-khimm/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Suzy Khimm</a>, <a href=""http://nyc.bindercon.com/speaker/jennifer-gonnerman/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jennifer Gonnerman</a>, <a href=""http://nyc.bindercon.com/speaker/stacia-brown/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stacia Brown</a>, <a href=""http://nyc.bindercon.com/speaker/lauren-kelley/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lauren Kelley</a>, <a href=""http://nyc.bindercon.com/speaker/ashley-c-ford/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ashley C. Ford</a>, <a href=""http://nyc.bindercon.com/speaker/jaclyn-friedman/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jaclyn Friedman</a>, and many more.<br/></p>
<p>In short, this is an incredible opportunity for me to learn new skills, connect with like-minded people, and get my work out there!</p>
<p>But NYC is a bit expensive. Okay, a LOT expensive and the Canadian dollar is not doing me any favours. That’s where you come in! I need your help to make my dream a reality. </p>
<p><b>Who are you?</b><br/></p>
<p>Hi! I'm Lindsay Tessier. Writer at large, wild-hearted rebel and witty conversationalist. Here's a picture of me celebrating Ernest Hemingway's birthday with a glass of scotch.                                 <br/></p>

<p>I love politics, fashion, punk and indie music, feminism, travel, neon pink accessories, and reading everything from Russian literature to comic books.</p>
<p>Last year I graduated from j-school and now I write freelance. I write about politics, social justice issues, feminism and tech. I also write about my experiences with PTSD, poverty, disability and mental health in the hopes it will help others dealing with similar issues. </p>
<p>My passion is investigative journalism. I'd really love to do more in depth, longform pieces. I think BinderCon will give me the skills and boost of confidence I need to keep pushing forward with my work.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Cost Breakdown</span><br/></p>
</div>
</div><div> <p>Here's how the $1300 breaks down:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>$922.17 for accommodation close to the venue</li>
<li>$379.80 for round-trip travel to the conference (best price when I checked multiple sites on Aug. 22)</li>
</ul>
<div>If the entire goal is not reached, the money raised will still be used to help send me to BinderCon. I will sell my clothes, books (<i>whimper</i>) and extra organs to make this happen because it is too great an opportunity to pass up.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If the campaign manages to exceed its goal, the extra money will go towards food and (depending on how much extra money is raised) an extra day in NYC. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><h3>Awesome Perks</h3></div>
<div>To show my gratitude, I'm offering some cool perks to those who donate!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">These include: </span></div>

<ul>

</div></div>","""Congratulations! We are thrilled to tell you, based on your impressive application, you have been chosen as a recipient of a scholarship to attend BinderCon in New York City, November 7 - 8, 2015""


AHHHHH! I got a scholarship to BinderCon! I'M SO EXCITED!

So... What is BinderCon?

BinderCon is a conference aimed at increasing the diversity of voices in the media by empowering women and gender non-conforming writers with tools, connections, and strategies to advance their careers. You can learn more about it here. 


My scholarship gives me access to two full days of panels, workshops, and networking events where I'll have the chance to pitch to (or at least make awkward chit chat with) editors and agents. I even get to attend their VIP party which gives me more opportunities to mingle with my fellow writers and social betters.




I'll get to learn from amazing writers and editors like Suzy Khimm, Jennifer Gonnerman, Stacia Brown, Lauren Kelley, Ashley C. Ford, Jaclyn Friedman, and many more.
In short, this is an incredible opportunity for me to learn new skills, connect with like-minded people, and get my work out there!
But NYC is a bit expensive. Okay, a LOT expensive and the Canadian dollar is not doing me any favours. That’s where you come in! I need your help to make my dream a reality. 
Who are you?
Hi! I'm Lindsay Tessier. Writer at large, wild-hearted rebel and witty conversationalist. Here's a picture of me celebrating Ernest Hemingway's birthday with a glass of scotch.                                 




  
I love politics, fashion, punk and indie music, feminism, travel, neon pink accessories, and reading everything from Russian literature to comic books.
Last year I graduated from j-school and now I write freelance. I write about politics, social justice issues, feminism and tech. I also write about my experiences with PTSD, poverty, disability and mental health in the hopes it will help others dealing with similar issues. 
My passion is investigative journalism. I'd really love to do more in depth, longform pieces. I think BinderCon will give me the skills and boost of confidence I need to keep pushing forward with my work.
Cost Breakdown

 Here's how the $1300 breaks down:


$922.17 for accommodation close to the venue
$379.80 for round-trip travel to the conference (best price when I checked multiple sites on Aug. 22)

If the entire goal is not reached, the money raised will still be used to help send me to BinderCon. I will sell my clothes, books (whimper) and extra organs to make this happen because it is too great an opportunity to pass up.

If the campaign manages to exceed its goal, the extra money will go towards food and (depending on how much extra money is raised) an extra day in NYC. 

Awesome Perks
To show my gratitude, I'm offering some cool perks to those who donate!

These include: 


Mystery postcard
Handwritten letter w/ a special surprise
Personal book recommendations
Delicious cookies
Yours truly singing a song of your choosing
And much more!



The Impact

American fashion designer Norma Kamali said, ""The most important thing to do is to take risks. The risks are where breakthroughs happen, and big shifts take you to new places and create opportunities."" 
I fully believe this. The most wonderful things in my life have come from being brave and taking risks. Going to NYC. Pitching my articles to strangers. Asking you for help. These are all risks. Risks I am willing to take to see what new opportunities they will bring. 
I believe this trip will help me be a braver, stronger writer. I mean, this is the city of Vogue, The New Yorker and The New York fucking Times. Some of that magic is bound to rub off on me.

<h3>The Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Sarah’s Still Life</i> is a coming-of-age journey about Sarah Hall, a tea shop clerk and aging student, who is reaching for a dream, looking for love, and dealing with the difficulties that fate puts in her path. Haunted by the influence of her father and weighed down by the demands of her mentally ill mother, Sarah is struggling to launch her life and make the future her own. <br/><br/>My name is Matthew Kopf, and I am the author of <i>Sarah’s Still Life</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to tell a story of a regular person struggling through life the way most of us do. Today, it seems, we’re surrounded by superhero stories and unrelatable characters with superhuman-like abilities or talents. This story is the antithesis of those.<br/><br/>I hope that readers discover, not only an enjoyable story, but feel as if they’ve experienced life through Sarah’s eyes. I hope it serves as a reminder of the hardships we all face while staring down this thing called life. When love, hard work, and circumstances collide, the outcome is always far from certain, or as Sarah’s late father would say, <i>Life is hard, wear a helmet</i>. <br/><br/>The journey spans two continents but begins in the American rustbelt. Sarah’s city was once an industrial powerhouse but has, over the last several decades, been reduced to a city in search of its soul and purpose. Many of its inhabitants have proceeded likewise and have found themselves in the constant hunt to get by. Sarah is no different. Sarah is a lonely, long-time student and tea shop clerk who dreams of being a food scientist and falling in love. She is passionate about studying the science behind tastes and flavors and longs to create new combinations for people to enjoy but is held back by lack of opportunities and the constant headwind of dealing with her mother’s illness.<br/><br/>When an old crush, the worldly and cultured Michael Kensington, enters her life she thinks her fortunes have changed. Though exciting, all is not what it seems and tragedy and crisis lurk close at hand.<br/><br/>Sarah’s world is populated with a variety of colorful characters, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>Loretta: Sarah’s boss and best friend who provides love and support as she tries to keep Sarah moving in the right direction.</li>
<li>Beatrice: a wealthy busybody with a penchant for high style.</li>
<li>Bernard: a patient old regular who is spending his twilight years yelling at newspapers and people watching. A constant presence at the tea shop, he is often a source of good humor and good advice.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>When Sarah’s adventure leads her to Marseille, France, she encounters Sam, an Armenian restauranteur who regales Sarah with tales of history and tragedy, while offering her a new world of tastes in the Armenian tradition. Sarah’s trip to Marseille broadens her horizons but leaves her facing a life-altering decision.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you like journeys of self-discovery, tales of love and loss, and worlds populated with interesting and colorful characters.<br/><br/>Sarah’s Still Life speaks to fiction fans everywhere who want to experience a tale of struggle and the small triumphs of everyday life through the lens of a long-suffering daughter and student who encounters love and loss on her way to self-discovery.</p>
