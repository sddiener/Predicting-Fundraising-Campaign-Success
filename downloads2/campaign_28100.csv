</p><p>(Für Deutsch nach unten scrollen)</p><p>Hello Friends wherever you are. My name is Miriama. I am a musician and a music teacher. For over 20 years I have facilitated music education for kids and adults through my rock school program. I was doing this even before the great Jack Black film "" School of Rock"" came out.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442151419/xz7lrhx3vhrdmcrr6j6x.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The program has been developed over the years for many students from varied backgrounds in USA and Germany.   Participants blossomed in their young lives getting the chance  to discover their own personal versions of the rock and roll dream.

</p><p> In late 2013, I traveled to Gambia, West Africa to volunteer at Fandema Women development Center in Tujering. Here is the story:</p><p></p><p>I had 2 guitars with me. My personal instrument for performances and one extra. My original idea was to find one lucky and motivated young woman, give her daily private lessons for the duration of my four week stay, and at the end, give her the guitar so that she could continue on her own. I arrived to the centre to offer my idea to The Center´s director, Malang Sambou. He suggested that we ask the women directly who among them might have interest to learn guitar. Later the same day  at the general meeting with everyone gathered together, Malang introduced me. I played one of Bob Marley´s songs, “No Woman No Cry”. Everyone sang along in the ""Everythings gonna be alright"" part. After an encore, (They wanted the same song again!), Malang asked the group in Mandinka, ""who would like to learn to play guitar?"" Almost all hands flew up. He continued: “OK, but whoever really wants to do it has to work very hard learning and practicing everyday, now who still wants to do it?” That narrowed the group to about half. He announced, “everyone who still wants to do it will now be tested on ability.  The best one will be chosen.” </p>
<p>We immediately began the audition process. I said, ""who´s first?"", only one brave hand went up. Remember, these girls had never seen a real guitar, much less held and played one. Amazingly, all were quite proficient in air guitar, which is a good sign.  </p>
<p>
</p><p>Mballing Bojang made her way to the hot seat. I showed her how to hold it , put her hand in position and asked her to play on the highest string frets 1-2-3-4 each with corresponding finger. I demonstrated. She did her best, but it wasn´t very good. The next came and she did a just a little bit better. Meanwhile the hall was absolutely silent. Everyone was concentrating and watching. The next one did better, the one after that even better than the one before. After about the 7th young woman, Mballing shouted out, “please! let me do do it again! I know I can do it!” I gave her another chance because she was brave enough to be the first and she did it great. In fact out of the 14 women who auditioned that day, there was really only one who I thought would not have an easy time understanding. Malang announced, ""OK, tomorrow we will announce  who has been chosen."" </p>
<p>
</p><p>How could I choose one? Half of them had a real potential, the other half could surely learn as well. I needed more guitars! The whole rest of the day, I asked everyone who I saw where I might find guitars in the Gambia. Finally, someone told me that they once saw a guitar in a supermarket in Brusuby. I went to the supermarket and sure enough, there it was, hanging high on a hook. It was covered in dust, with missing, rusted strings and  generally in bad shape. I doubted that it would stay in tune at all. But I needed guitars, so I made the clerk an offer of half the asked price. I said, “this is a very poor quality instrument. It is not worth the price.” He said I´d have to talk to the boss. The bossman came over and said, ""we have more guitars do you wish to see them?"" Yes! He brought out 10 more of the gnarliest, lowest quality plywood guitars I had ever seen.  Some were made in China, some in India. All just a small step above toys. I spent the next several hours stringing up and tuning, trying out each of the guitars. 4 of them were unacceptable. The other 6 I bought with a bulk discount. The price of each instrument costing €25. Including the instrument I brought, we now had 7 plus mine, eight total.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442152055/v0we5o9qk4cinlsbyelv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>I put the 14 women into 2 groups and the next day, our workshop began in earnest. We accepted the challenge from Malang to put together a song to perform for the winter festival which was to be held 5 days later. What was suggested to be a daily 2 hour session (1 each for each group) stretched out to many hours everyday. When the first group had the session, the 2nd stayed and watched. When it was the 2nd´s turn, the First group also stayed and watched. They were really only one group of 14, not two of 7. The women went to their other classes and immediately returned to the guitars. They couldn´t get enough. Once they mastered one technique, they ran to me wanting the next. Meanwhile, the low quality instruments were steadily falling apart and I was constantly tuning, hammering frets back into the necks and repairing them best as I could to keep them functioning. </p>
<p>Since we only had 8 guitars, only 8 could play the guitars, the others would sing and/or dance for the performance. This pushed them even more as I was assigning the guitars one by one to the women who could best play the song. The women chose to perform the song, “The African Tears”, a song about African migrants losing their lives trying to get to a better life in Europe. They rehearsed until the last moment before their performance. The show was amazing. They absolutely rocked! I will never forget it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In the Gambia there is a rich traditional music culture with beautiful instruments like Kora, balafon, Ngoni, riti, etc... Women from the Griot families participate primarily as backing singers. There is also a thriving pop music scene where women are singers or dancers but don´t play instruments. Only men play guitar, bass, drumset, horns and other instruments.   As a woman whose life, living, and leisure revolves around playing and teaching guitar, it is only natural that I would want to share that gift with my African sisters who never before had the chance. Women and girls love to to play guitars! I know I do.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442152940/gvnxx0ae7rf0jtecf5e3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p> 
<p>
</p><p>I promised the girls I would come back one day to teach them more. </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Now, after 2 years of preparation, I am ready to launch my new project.</span></p>
<p>It´s called, “The Groovy African Ladies Music School”.</p>
<p>I will return to Fandema and help build up a lasting music program there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The vision is to establish the first and only music school for girls and women and ultimately the first professional all women band and events/entertainment production company in the Gambia. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The program is entrepreneurial by design and will teach participating women from the ground up to learn about the many aspects of an independent music/entertainment industry. The Groovy African Ladies (GALs) Music School will be the most grassroots rock school ever known.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The women at Fandema are already doing it for themselves in many ways with an enormous benefit to the community at large.  Many of the young women participating had never previously been to school at all. All the programs at Fandema are designed with the goal of alleviating poverty in the community. In the local Mandinka language, Fandema means “help yourself”.</p>
<p>
</p><p> On top of basic language, computer and business skills studies, crews of women are building and installing solar electric systems, creating beautiful arts and quality products that are market ready. They have programs in sewing/fashion/textiles, printing and silk screening, midwifery, environmental sustainability, hotel, restaurant and eco-tourism management.</p>
<p>Music and the entertainment industry will be the next career path option that will be offered to participating young women.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But how to pay for it?  Unfortunately, these women and girls (and boys) in Gambia have no financial support whatsoever. The participants attend the programs at Fandema free of charge as long as they complete the program. Only if they leave in the middle are they required to repay for the resources that they had utilised before quitting. As for a music program, the center now possesses a few very low quality instruments which will not last. Half of the guitars I bought at the supermarket did not survive for long after my workshop was completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I went home to Germany inspired to find a donor organisation to fund the project. The reality soon hit me. I am a  busy working musician and music teacher. I don´t know anything about fundraising. I found all the protocols and language required in attaining project grants completely daunting. I do not have nonprofit status. Considering my education and experience, I am uniquely qualified to facilitate this project, but I am one single person with a vision.</p>
<p>
</p><p> I decided to do what I am able to do. I wrote a bunch of songs and recorded a new CD. Now I am waging  a crowd funding campaign to offer my music as a perk with the hope to  to raise enough money to fund the first year of the first all woman rock school in West Africa!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442154776/xhjshyrhejqbvzqxsqpp.png"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p><p>The plan is to finance music education with music. My brand new solo recording is called, “Far and Wide”. It is a collection of travel and love songs. I am pre-releasing the album exclusively in the campaign.  Everything will go to fund GALs.  If all 2000 of the first run of the physical CDs are claimed, that alone could fund the first year of operating costs, including instruments, materials and transportation. I am personally investing my time, my expertise and all my heart in the first year to get it rolling. I am confident that the results we will achieve after the first year will attract support to fund subsequent years until the project is self-sustaining. I am offering other prizes as well; live appearances, wearables, downloads and other music swag.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442404330/yifqpooe9suuzzb7vpi1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><br/></p>

<br/>
<p>Ende 2013 reiste ich nach Gambia, Westafrika, um dort in Tujereng als Freiwillige im Fandema Women Development Center zu arbeiten. </p>
<p>Hier ist die Geschichte:</p>
<div>
<div>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Ich hatte zwei Gitarren dabei - mein persönliches Instrument für Auftritte und eine weitere.
Meine ursprüngliche Idee war, dass e i n e motivierte junge Frau das Glück haben sollte, für
die Dauer meines vierwöchigen Aufenthaltes täglich privaten Unterricht von mir zu
bekommen. Am Ende wollte ich ihr dann die Gitarre überlassen, damit sie alleine
weitermachen könnte. Ich kam in das Center, um dem Direktor, Malang Sambou, meine Idee
zu unterbreiten. Er schlug vor, die Frauen direkt zu fragen, wer von ihnen vielleicht Interesse
habe, Gitarre spielen zu lernen. Noch am selben Tag, als alle Mitglieder des Centers sich
versammelt hatten, stellte Malang mich vor. Ich spielte eines von Bob Marleys Liedern, “No
Woman No Cry”. Bei ""Everythings gonna be alright"" sangen alle mit. Nach einer Zugabe (sie
wollten das gleiche Lied nochmals hören!) fragte Malang die Gruppe auf Mandinka: ""Wer
würde gerne Gitarre spielen lernen?"" Fast alle Hände flogen hoch. Er fuhr fort: “OK, aber wer
es wirklich lernen will, muss sehr hart arbeiten, jeden Tag lernen und üben. Wer will es jetzt
immer noch machen?” Das reduzierte die Gruppe auf etwa die Hälfte. Er kündigte an: “Jede,
die es immer noch will, wird jetzt auf ihre Eignung geprüft, und die Beste wird ausgewählt."" </p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Wir begannen sofort mit dem Vorspielen. Ich sagte: ""Wer ist die erste?"" Nur eine mutige Hand ging nach oben. Bedenken Sie, diese Mädchen hatten noch nie eine echte Gitarre gesehen, erst recht keine gehalten oder gar gespielt. Erstaunlicherweise waren alle ziemlich geübt im Luftgitarrespielen, was ein gutes Zeichen ist. </p>
<p>Mballing Bojang setzte sich auf den heißen Stuhl. Ich zeigte ihr, wie die Gitarre gehalten wird, legte ihre Hand in Position und bat sie, auf den obersten Bünden 1-2-3-4 jeden mit dem entsprechenden Finger zu spielen. Ich machte es vor. Sie gab ihr Bestes, aber es war nicht besonders gut. Die nächste kam und machte es ein bisschen besser. Inzwischen war es in der Halle absolut still. Alle waren konzentriert und sahen zu. Die nach ihr kam, machte es wieder etwas besser, und die darauf folgende sogar noch ein bisschen besser. Als schon etwa die Hälfte der jungen Frauen vorgespielt hatte, rief Mballing, “Bitte! Lassen Sie mich es nochmals versuchen! Ich weiß, dass ich es kann!” Da sie so mutig gewesen war, sich als erste prüfen zu lassen, gab ich ihr natürlich noch eine Chance, und sie machte es toll. Tatsächlich gab es unter den vierzehn Frauen, die an diesem Tag vorgespielt hatten, nur eine einzige, von der ich dachte, sie würde Schwierigkeiten haben, es zu lernen. Malang kündigte an: ""OK, morgen werden wir bekannt geben, wer ausgewählt wurde."" </p>
<p>Aber wie sollte ich eine auswählen? Die Hälfte von ihnen zeigte echtes Potenzial, und auch die andere Hälfte könnte bestimmt Gitarre spielen lernen. Ich brauchte mehr Gitarren! Den restlichen Tag über fragte ich jeden, den ich sah, wo ich in Gambia Gitarren finden könnte. Schließlich erzählte mir jemand, dass sie einmal in einem Supermarkt in Brusuby eine Gitarre gesehen hätten. Ich ging zum Supermarkt, und siehe da, dort hing eine hoch oben an einem Haken. Sie war mit Staub bedeckt, Saiten fehlten, andere waren rostig, ihr gesamter Zustand war schlecht. Ich bezweifelte, dass sie überhaupt gestimmt bleiben würde. Aber ich brauchte Gitarren, also machte ich dem Verkäufer ein Angebot - die Hälfte des geforderten Preises. Ich sagte: “Das ist ein Instrument von sehr geringer Qualität. Es ist das Geld nicht wert.” Er sagte, ich müsse mit dem Chef sprechen. Der Chef kam und sagte: ""Wir haben noch mehr Gitarren. Wollen Sie sie sehen?"" Ja! Er brachte zehn weitere; das waren die gröbsten und schlechtesten Sperrholzgitarren, die ich je gesehen hatte. Einige waren in China, andere in Indien hergestellt worden und alle kaum besser als Spielzeug. Ich verbrachte die folgenden Stunden damit, die Gitarren zu besaiten und zu stimmen und probierte jede davon aus. Vier von ihnen waren unbrauchbar. Die übrigen sechs kaufte ich mit Mengenrabatt. Jedes Instrument kostete 25 Euro. Einschließlich der von mir mitgebrachten hatten wir nun sieben Gitarren plus meine eigene, insgesamt also acht. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Ich teilte die vierzehn Frauen in zwei Gruppen auf, und am nächsten Tag begann tatsächlich
unser Workshop. Wir nahmen Malangs Herausforderung an, einen Song einzuüben und auf
dem Winterfest aufzuführen, das fünf Tage später stattfinden sollte. Was als zweistündige
Session pro Tag vorgeschlagen worden war (je eine Stunde für jede Gruppe), erstreckte sich
nun über viele Stunden jeden Tag. Wenn die erste Gruppe ihren Unterricht hatte, blieb die
zweite und sah zu. Wenn die zweite an der Reihe war, blieb auch die erste Gruppe und sah
zu. In Wirklichkeit war es nur eine Gruppe mit vierzehn, nicht zwei mit sieben
Teilnehmerinnen. Die Frauen gingen zu ihren anderen Unterrichtsstunden und kehrten dann
sofort zu ihren Gitarren zurück. Sie konnten nicht genug bekommen. Sobald sie eine Technik
beherrschten, kamen sie zu mir gelaufen und wollten die nächste gezeigt bekommen.
Mittlerweile fielen die minderwertigen Instrumente schon auseinander, und ich musste sie
ständig stimmen, Bünde zurück in Hälse hämmern und sie reparieren so gut ich konnte, um
sie funktionsfähig zu halten. Da wir nur acht Gitarren hatten, konnten nur acht auf Gitarren
spielen, die anderen würden in der Aufführung singen und/oder tanzen. Das spornte sie noch
mehr an, denn ich wies die Gitarren eine nach der anderen den Frauen zu, die den Song am
besten spielen konnten. Die Frauen hatten sich entschieden, den Song “The African Tears”
zu spielen, ein Song über afrikanische Migranten, die ihr Leben verlieren auf der Suche nach einem besseren Leben in Europa. Sie übten ihn bis zum letzten Moment vor ihrem Auftritt, und die Show war
einfach herrlich. Sie waren absolut toll! Das werde ich nie vergessen. </p>

<p>In Gambia existiert eine reiche traditionelle Musikkultur mit wunderschönen Instrumenten wie
Kora, Balafon, Ngoni, Riti usw. Frauen aus den Griot-Familien sind in erster Linie als
Backgroundsängerinnen dabei. Es gibt auch eine blühende Popmusik-Szene, wo Frauen als
Sängerinnen oder Tänzerinnen auftreten, aber keine Instrumente spielen. Nur die Männer
spielen Gitarre, Bass, Schlagzeug, Blasinstrumente und andere Instrumente. Als eine Frau,
deren Leben, Unterhalt und Freizeit sich um Gitarrenspiel und Gitarrenunterricht drehen, ist
es nur natürlich, dass ich dieses Geschenk gerne mit meinen afrikanischen Schwestern
teilen möchte, die nie zuvor eine solche Gelegenheit hatten. Frauen und Mädchen lieben es,
Gitarre zu spielen! Ich weiß das, denn ich tue es. </p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Ich versprach den Mädchen, dass ich eines Tages wiederkommen würde, um sie weiter zu
unterrichten. Jetzt, nach zwei Jahren Vorbereitung, bin ich bereit, mein neues Projekt zu
starten. Es heißt: “The Groovy African Ladies Music School”. Ich werde wieder zum
Fandema Center reisen und helfen, dort ein dauerhaftes Musikprogramm aufzubauen.
</p>
<p>Meine Vision ist, in Gambia die erste und einzige Musikschule für Mädchen und Frauen zu
etablieren, aus der letztendlich auch die erste professionelle Frauenband und von Frauen
geführte Veranstaltungs- und Musikproduktionsfirma hervorgehen sollen. Das Programm ist
vom Aufbau her unternehmerisch ausgerichtet und wird den teilnehmenden Frauen von
Grund auf die vielen Aspekte einer unabhängigen Musik- und Entertainmentindustrie <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">vermitteln. The Groovy African Ladies (GALs) Music School wird eine Rockschule mit so
breit gefächertem Angebot sein, wie es bisher noch keine gegeben hat. </span></p>

<div>
<div>
<p>Die Frauen bei Fandema arbeiten schon in vielen Bereichen mit enormem Nutzen für ihr
gesamtes gesellschaftliches Umfeld. Viele der teilnehmenden jungen Frauen hatten nie
zuvor irgendeine Schule besucht. Alle Programme von Fandema sind darauf ausgerichtet,
die Armut in der Gesellschaft zu mindern. Fandema bedeutet in der lokalen Mandinka-
Sprache “Hilf dir selbst”.
</p>
<p>Zusätzlich zum Unterricht, in dem Grundwissen in Sprachen, Computeranwendung und
Betriebswirtschaft vermittelt wird, bauen und installieren Frauenteams Solarstromsysteme
und schaffen schöne Kunstobjekte und Qualitätsprodukte, die vermarktet werden können. Es
gibt Kurse für Nähen, Modedesign, Textilkunde, Druck- und Siebdruckverfahren,
Geburtshilfe, ökologische Nachhaltigkeit, Hotel- und Restaurant- sowie Ökotourismus-
Management. Der Weg zu einer beruflichen Laufbahn in der Musikbranche und in der
Unterhaltungsindustrie wird den jungen Frauen als nächstes angeboten werden.
</p>
<p>Aber wie soll das finanziert werden? Leider erhalten diese Frauen und Mädchen in Gambia
keinerlei finanzielle Unterstützung. Die Teilnahme an den Programmen von Fandema ist
kostenlos, wenn die Teilnehmerinnen ihre Kurse abschließen. Nur, wenn sie die Kurse
vorzeitig verlassen, müssen sie für die Materialien zahlen, die sie bis dahin verbraucht
haben. Was das Musikprogramm betrifft, so verfügt das Center jetzt über ein paar sehr
minderwertige Instrumente, die nicht lange halten werden. Die Hälfte der Gitarren, die ich im
Supermarkt gekauft hatte, hat das Ende meines Workshops nicht lange überlebt. </p>

<div>
<div>
<p>Ich kehrte nach Deutschland zurück in der Überzeugung, eine Spender-Organisation zu
finden, die das Projekt finanzieren würde. Die Realität holte mich bald ein. Ich bin eine
vielbeschäftigte Musikerin und Musiklehrerin. Davon, wie man Geld sammelt, habe ich keine
Ahnung. Angesichts all der Formalien, die erfüllt sein müssen, um Projektzuschüsse zu
erhalten, und der dafür erforderlichen sprachlichen Voraussetzungen fühlte ich mich
vollkommen entmutigt. Ich besitze keinen gemeinnützigen Status. Hinsichtlich meiner
Ausbildung und Erfahrung bin ich ganz besonders qualifiziert, dieses Projekt zu unterstützen,
aber ich bin nur eine einzelne Person mit einer Vision.
</p>
<p>Ich beschloss zu tun, was mir möglich ist. Ich schrieb ein paar Songs und nahm eine neue
CD auf. Jetzt führe ich eine Crowdfunding-Kampagne, in der ich meine Musik als
Gegenleistung für Spenden anbiete, und hoffe, dass ich damit genug Geld sammeln kann,
um das erste Jahr der ersten Rockschule für Frauen in Westafrika zu finanzieren! </p>

<p>Die Idee ist, Musikunterricht mit Musik zu finanzieren. Meine brandneue Soloaufnahme heißt
“Far and Wide”. Sie enthält eine Sammlung von Reise- und Liebesliedern. Dieses Album
veröffentliche ich vorab exklusiv im Rahmen dieser Kampagne. Alle Einnahmen daraus
werden in die Finanzierung der GALs fließen. Würden alle 2000 CDs der ersten Auflage
abgerufen werden, könnte allein das die Betriebskosten des ersten Jahres tragen,
einschließlich Instrumente, Materialien und Transport. Ich investiere meine Musik, meine
Zeit, mein Know-how und mein ganzes Herz in das erste Jahr, um das Projekt auf den Weg
zu bringen. Und ich bin zuversichtlich, dass die Ergebnisse, die wir nach einem Jahr erzielt
haben werden, genug Unterstützung nach sich ziehen werden, um die folgenden Jahre zu
finanzieren. Außer meiner CD biete ich auch noch anderes an: Live-Auftritte, T-Shirts,
Downloads und weitere Musikartikel. </p>

</div></div>","(Für Deutsch nach unten scrollen)Hello Friends wherever you are. My name is Miriama. I am a musician and a music teacher. For over 20 years I have facilitated music education for kids and adults through my rock school program. I was doing this even before the great Jack Black film "" School of Rock"" came out.  The program has been developed over the years for many students from varied backgrounds in USA and Germany.   Participants blossomed in their young lives getting the chance  to discover their own personal versions of the rock and roll dream. Many of my earlier students are now professional musicians and true artists. I thank them for being the experimental pilots in the early development of the program.

 In late 2013, I traveled to Gambia, West Africa to volunteer at Fandema Women development Center in Tujering. Here is the story:I had 2 guitars with me. My personal instrument for performances and one extra. My original idea was to find one lucky and motivated young woman, give her daily private lessons for the duration of my four week stay, and at the end, give her the guitar so that she could continue on her own. I arrived to the centre to offer my idea to The Center´s director, Malang Sambou. He suggested that we ask the women directly who among them might have interest to learn guitar. Later the same day  at the general meeting with everyone gathered together, Malang introduced me. I played one of Bob Marley´s songs, “No Woman No Cry”. Everyone sang along in the ""Everythings gonna be alright"" part. After an encore, (They wanted the same song again!), Malang asked the group in Mandinka, ""who would like to learn to play guitar?"" Almost all hands flew up. He continued: “OK, but whoever really wants to do it has to work very hard learning and practicing everyday, now who still wants to do it?” That narrowed the group to about half. He announced, “everyone who still wants to do it will now be tested on ability.  The best one will be chosen.” 
We immediately began the audition process. I said, ""who´s first?"", only one brave hand went up. Remember, these girls had never seen a real guitar, much less held and played one. Amazingly, all were quite proficient in air guitar, which is a good sign.  

Mballing Bojang made her way to the hot seat. I showed her how to hold it , put her hand in position and asked her to play on the highest string frets 1-2-3-4 each with corresponding finger. I demonstrated. She did her best, but it wasn´t very good. The next came and she did a just a little bit better. Meanwhile the hall was absolutely silent. Everyone was concentrating and watching. The next one did better, the one after that even better than the one before. After about the 7th young woman, Mballing shouted out, “please! let me do do it again! I know I can do it!” I gave her another chance because she was brave enough to be the first and she did it great. In fact out of the 14 women who auditioned that day, there was really only one who I thought would not have an easy time understanding. Malang announced, ""OK, tomorrow we will announce  who has been chosen."" 

How could I choose one? Half of them had a real potential, the other half could surely learn as well. I needed more guitars! The whole rest of the day, I asked everyone who I saw where I might find guitars in the Gambia. Finally, someone told me that they once saw a guitar in a supermarket in Brusuby. I went to the supermarket and sure enough, there it was, hanging high on a hook. It was covered in dust, with missing, rusted strings and  generally in bad shape. I doubted that it would stay in tune at all. But I needed guitars, so I made the clerk an offer of half the asked price. I said, “this is a very poor quality instrument. It is not worth the price.” He said I´d have to talk to the boss. The bossman came over and said, ""we have more guitars do you wish to see them?"" Yes! He brought out 10 more of the gnarliest, lowest quality plywood guitars I had ever seen.  Some were made in China, some in India. All just a small step above toys. I spent the next several hours stringing up and tuning, trying out each of the guitars. 4 of them were unacceptable. The other 6 I bought with a bulk discount. The price of each instrument costing €25. Including the instrument I brought, we now had 7 plus mine, eight total.I put the 14 women into 2 groups and the next day, our workshop began in earnest. We accepted the challenge from Malang to put together a song to perform for the winter festival which was to be held 5 days later. What was suggested to be a daily 2 hour session (1 each for each group) stretched out to many hours everyday. When the first group had the session, the 2nd stayed and watched. When it was the 2nd´s turn, the First group also stayed and watched. They were really only one group of 14, not two of 7. The women went to their other classes and immediately returned to the guitars. They couldn´t get enough. Once they mastered one technique, they ran to me wanting the next. Meanwhile, the low quality instruments were steadily falling apart and I was constantly tuning, hammering frets back into the necks and repairing them best as I could to keep them functioning. 
Since we only had 8 guitars, only 8 could play the guitars, the others would sing and/or dance for the performance. This pushed them even more as I was assigning the guitars one by one to the women who could best play the song. The women chose to perform the song, “The African Tears”, a song about African migrants losing their lives trying to get to a better life in Europe. They rehearsed until the last moment before their performance. The show was amazing. They absolutely rocked! I will never forget it.


In the Gambia there is a rich traditional music culture with beautiful instruments like Kora, balafon, Ngoni, riti, etc... Women from the Griot families participate primarily as backing singers. There is also a thriving pop music scene where women are singers or dancers but don´t play instruments. Only men play guitar, bass, drumset, horns and other instruments.   As a woman whose life, living, and leisure revolves around playing and teaching guitar, it is only natural that I would want to share that gift with my African sisters who never before had the chance. Women and girls love to to play guitars! I know I do. 

I promised the girls I would come back one day to teach them more. Now, after 2 years of preparation, I am ready to launch my new project.
It´s called, “The Groovy African Ladies Music School”.
I will return to Fandema and help build up a lasting music program there.

The vision is to establish the first and only music school for girls and women and ultimately the first professional all women band and events/entertainment production company in the Gambia. 



The program is entrepreneurial by design and will teach participating women from the ground up to learn about the many aspects of an independent music/entertainment industry. The Groovy African Ladies (GALs) Music School will be the most grassroots rock school ever known.



The women at Fandema are already doing it for themselves in many ways with an enormous benefit to the community at large.  Many of the young women participating had never previously been to school at all. All the programs at Fandema are designed with the goal of alleviating poverty in the community. In the local Mandinka language, Fandema means “help yourself”.

 On top of basic language, computer and business skills studies, crews of women are building and installing solar electric systems, creating beautiful arts and quality products that are market ready. They have programs in sewing/fashion/textiles, printing and silk screening, midwifery, environmental sustainability, hotel, restaurant and eco-tourism management.
Music and the entertainment industry will be the next career path option that will be offered to participating young women.


But how to pay for it?  Unfortunately, these women and girls (and boys) in Gambia have no financial support whatsoever. The participants attend the programs at Fandema free of charge as long as they complete the program. Only if they leave in the middle are they required to repay for the resources that they had utilised before quitting. As for a music program, the center now possesses a few very low quality instruments which will not last. Half of the guitars I bought at the supermarket did not survive for long after my workshop was completed.


I went home to Germany inspired to find a donor organisation to fund the project. The reality soon hit me. I am a  busy working musician and music teacher. I don´t know anything about fundraising. I found all the protocols and language required in attaining project grants completely daunting. I do not have nonprofit status. Considering my education and experience, I am uniquely qualified to facilitate this project, but I am one single person with a vision.

 I decided to do what I am able to do. I wrote a bunch of songs and recorded a new CD. Now I am waging  a crowd funding campaign to offer my music as a perk with the hope to  to raise enough money to fund the first year of the first all woman rock school in West Africa!The plan is to finance music education with music. My brand new solo recording is called, “Far and Wide”. It is a collection of travel and love songs. I am pre-releasing the album exclusively in the campaign.  Everything will go to fund GALs.  If all 2000 of the first run of the physical CDs are claimed, that alone could fund the first year of operating costs, including instruments, materials and transportation. I am personally investing my time, my expertise and all my heart in the first year to get it rolling. I am confident that the results we will achieve after the first year will attract support to fund subsequent years until the project is self-sustaining. I am offering other prizes as well; live appearances, wearables, downloads and other music swag.

I am asking for help! Please support this project by buying my CD and swag, booking a live appearance, and donating as much as you can. Even if you can´t donate,  please pass the campaign link to your friends and networks who might be interested to support grassroots music education and the groovy african ladies music school.Here is how I will use the money when I reach my goal:
1. Music materials/ Instruments-                                                     €1945           including 6 acoustic guitars, 2 electric, 2 bass2. Room/board for 5 months                                                             €4500        600€ x5 months =€3000+1,500 (food €10 per diem)3. Transportation, personal and for materials                             €25004. Stipend for apprentice                                                                     €10005. Stipend for guest programs/field trips                                      €10006. Office/communications/telephone/Computer                     €2000If we are successful in funding our initial year, any donations received beyond our first goal of US $14,500  (€12,957) will be rolled over to finance equipment needed for the 2nd year´s curriculum, housing, promotional costs and other expenses.If we are unsuccessful in raising our stated goal of US $14,500 (€12,945), The project will proceed anyway, just on a more bare bones budget with less materials.                                







Hallo, ich heiße Miriama, bin Musikerin und Musiklehrerin. Seit über 20 Jahren führe ich
Kinder und Erwachsene mit meinem eigenen Rockschulprogramm, das ich sogar schon,
bevor Jack Blacks großartiger Film ""School of Rock"" herauskam, angewendet habe, durch
ihre musikalische Ausbildung. 









Das Programm habe ich im Laufe der Jahre entwickelt, für die
vielen Schüler mit ganz unterschiedlichem Background, die in den USA und in Deutschland
zu mir kamen. Die Teilnehmer konnten sich frei entfalten, weil sie die Chance erhielten, ihre
eigenen, ganz persönlichen Versionen des Rock'n'Roll-Traumes zu entdecken. Viele meiner
früheren Schüler sind heute Berufsmusiker und wahre Künstler. Ich danke ihnen dafür, dass
sie in der ersten Entwicklungsphase meines Programms die Rolle der Testpiloten
übernommen haben. 






Ende 2013 reiste ich nach Gambia, Westafrika, um dort in Tujereng als Freiwillige im Fandema Women Development Center zu arbeiten. 
Hier ist die Geschichte:










Ich hatte zwei Gitarren dabei - mein persönliches Instrument für Auftritte und eine weitere.
Meine ursprüngliche Idee war, dass e i n e motivierte junge Frau das Glück haben sollte, für
die Dauer meines vierwöchigen Aufenthaltes täglich privaten Unterricht von mir zu
bekommen. Am Ende wollte ich ihr dann die Gitarre überlassen, damit sie alleine
weitermachen könnte. Ich kam in das Center, um dem Direktor, Malang Sambou, meine Idee
zu unterbreiten. Er schlug vor, die Frauen direkt zu fragen, wer von ihnen vielleicht Interesse
habe, Gitarre spielen zu lernen. Noch am selben Tag, als alle Mitglieder des Centers sich
versammelt hatten, stellte Malang mich vor. Ich spielte eines von Bob Marleys Liedern, “No
Woman No Cry”. Bei ""Everythings gonna be alright"" sangen alle mit. Nach einer Zugabe (sie
wollten das gleiche Lied nochmals hören!) fragte Malang die Gruppe auf Mandinka: ""Wer
würde gerne Gitarre spielen lernen?"" Fast alle Hände flogen hoch. Er fuhr fort: “OK, aber wer
es wirklich lernen will, muss sehr hart arbeiten, jeden Tag lernen und üben. Wer will es jetzt
immer noch machen?” Das reduzierte die Gruppe auf etwa die Hälfte. Er kündigte an: “Jede,
die es immer noch will, wird jetzt auf ihre Eignung geprüft, und die Beste wird ausgewählt."" 



Wir begannen sofort mit dem Vorspielen. Ich sagte: ""Wer ist die erste?"" Nur eine mutige Hand ging nach oben. Bedenken Sie, diese Mädchen hatten noch nie eine echte Gitarre gesehen, erst recht keine gehalten oder gar gespielt. Erstaunlicherweise waren alle ziemlich geübt im Luftgitarrespielen, was ein gutes Zeichen ist. 
Mballing Bojang setzte sich auf den heißen Stuhl. Ich zeigte ihr, wie die Gitarre gehalten wird, legte ihre Hand in Position und bat sie, auf den obersten Bünden 1-2-3-4 jeden mit dem entsprechenden Finger zu spielen. Ich machte es vor. Sie gab ihr Bestes, aber es war nicht besonders gut. Die nächste kam und machte es ein bisschen besser. Inzwischen war es in der Halle absolut still. Alle waren konzentriert und sahen zu. Die nach ihr kam, machte es wieder etwas besser, und die darauf folgende sogar noch ein bisschen besser. Als schon etwa die Hälfte der jungen Frauen vorgespielt hatte, rief Mballing, “Bitte! Lassen Sie mich es nochmals versuchen! Ich weiß, dass ich es kann!” Da sie so mutig gewesen war, sich als erste prüfen zu lassen, gab ich ihr natürlich noch eine Chance, und sie machte es toll. Tatsächlich gab es unter den vierzehn Frauen, die an diesem Tag vorgespielt hatten, nur eine einzige, von der ich dachte, sie würde Schwierigkeiten haben, es zu lernen. Malang kündigte an: ""OK, morgen werden wir bekannt geben, wer ausgewählt wurde."" 
Aber wie sollte ich eine auswählen? Die Hälfte von ihnen zeigte echtes Potenzial, und auch die andere Hälfte könnte bestimmt Gitarre spielen lernen. Ich brauchte mehr Gitarren! Den restlichen Tag über fragte ich jeden, den ich sah, wo ich in Gambia Gitarren finden könnte. Schließlich erzählte mir jemand, dass sie einmal in einem Supermarkt in Brusuby eine Gitarre gesehen hätten. Ich ging zum Supermarkt, und siehe da, dort hing eine hoch oben an einem Haken. Sie war mit Staub bedeckt, Saiten fehlten, andere waren rostig, ihr gesamter Zustand war schlecht. Ich bezweifelte, dass sie überhaupt gestimmt bleiben würde. Aber ich brauchte Gitarren, also machte ich dem Verkäufer ein Angebot - die Hälfte des geforderten Preises. Ich sagte: “Das ist ein Instrument von sehr geringer Qualität. Es ist das Geld nicht wert.” Er sagte, ich müsse mit dem Chef sprechen. Der Chef kam und sagte: ""Wir haben noch mehr Gitarren. Wollen Sie sie sehen?"" Ja! Er brachte zehn weitere; das waren die gröbsten und schlechtesten Sperrholzgitarren, die ich je gesehen hatte. Einige waren in China, andere in Indien hergestellt worden und alle kaum besser als Spielzeug. Ich verbrachte die folgenden Stunden damit, die Gitarren zu besaiten und zu stimmen und probierte jede davon aus. Vier von ihnen waren unbrauchbar. Die übrigen sechs kaufte ich mit Mengenrabatt. Jedes Instrument kostete 25 Euro. Einschließlich der von mir mitgebrachten hatten wir nun sieben Gitarren plus meine eigene, insgesamt also acht. 






Ich teilte die vierzehn Frauen in zwei Gruppen auf, und am nächsten Tag begann tatsächlich
unser Workshop. Wir nahmen Malangs Herausforderung an, einen Song einzuüben und auf
dem Winterfest aufzuführen, das fünf Tage später stattfinden sollte. Was als zweistündige
Session pro Tag vorgeschlagen worden war (je eine Stunde für jede Gruppe), erstreckte sich
nun über viele Stunden jeden Tag. Wenn die erste Gruppe ihren Unterricht hatte, blieb die
zweite und sah zu. Wenn die zweite an der Reihe war, blieb auch die erste Gruppe und sah
zu. In Wirklichkeit war es nur eine Gruppe mit vierzehn, nicht zwei mit sieben
Teilnehmerinnen. Die Frauen gingen zu ihren anderen Unterrichtsstunden und kehrten dann
sofort zu ihren Gitarren zurück. Sie konnten nicht genug bekommen. Sobald sie eine Technik
beherrschten, kamen sie zu mir gelaufen und wollten die nächste gezeigt bekommen.
Mittlerweile fielen die minderwertigen Instrumente schon auseinander, und ich musste sie
ständig stimmen, Bünde zurück in Hälse hämmern und sie reparieren so gut ich konnte, um
sie funktionsfähig zu halten. Da wir nur acht Gitarren hatten, konnten nur acht auf Gitarren
spielen, die anderen würden in der Aufführung singen und/oder tanzen. Das spornte sie noch
mehr an, denn ich wies die Gitarren eine nach der anderen den Frauen zu, die den Song am
besten spielen konnten. Die Frauen hatten sich entschieden, den Song “The African Tears”
zu spielen, ein Song über afrikanische Migranten, die ihr Leben verlieren auf der Suche nach einem besseren Leben in Europa. Sie übten ihn bis zum letzten Moment vor ihrem Auftritt, und die Show war
einfach herrlich. Sie waren absolut toll! Das werde ich nie vergessen. 













In Gambia existiert eine reiche traditionelle Musikkultur mit wunderschönen Instrumenten wie
Kora, Balafon, Ngoni, Riti usw. Frauen aus den Griot-Familien sind in erster Linie als
Backgroundsängerinnen dabei. Es gibt auch eine blühende Popmusik-Szene, wo Frauen als
Sängerinnen oder Tänzerinnen auftreten, aber keine Instrumente spielen. Nur die Männer
spielen Gitarre, Bass, Schlagzeug, Blasinstrumente und andere Instrumente. Als eine Frau,
deren Leben, Unterhalt und Freizeit sich um Gitarrenspiel und Gitarrenunterricht drehen, ist
es nur natürlich, dass ich dieses Geschenk gerne mit meinen afrikanischen Schwestern
teilen möchte, die nie zuvor eine solche Gelegenheit hatten. Frauen und Mädchen lieben es,
Gitarre zu spielen! Ich weiß das, denn ich tue es. 








Ich versprach den Mädchen, dass ich eines Tages wiederkommen würde, um sie weiter zu
unterrichten. Jetzt, nach zwei Jahren Vorbereitung, bin ich bereit, mein neues Projekt zu
starten. Es heißt: “The Groovy African Ladies Music School”. Ich werde wieder zum
Fandema Center reisen und helfen, dort ein dauerhaftes Musikprogramm aufzubauen.

Meine Vision ist, in Gambia die erste und einzige Musikschule für Mädchen und Frauen zu
etablieren, aus der letztendlich auch die erste professionelle Frauenband und von Frauen
geführte Veranstaltungs- und Musikproduktionsfirma hervorgehen sollen. Das Programm ist
vom Aufbau her unternehmerisch ausgerichtet und wird den teilnehmenden Frauen von
Grund auf die vielen Aspekte einer unabhängigen Musik- und Entertainmentindustrie vermitteln. The Groovy African Ladies (GALs) Music School wird eine Rockschule mit so
breit gefächertem Angebot sein, wie es bisher noch keine gegeben hat. 













Die Frauen bei Fandema arbeiten schon in vielen Bereichen mit enormem Nutzen für ihr
gesamtes gesellschaftliches Umfeld. Viele der teilnehmenden jungen Frauen hatten nie
zuvor irgendeine Schule besucht. Alle Programme von Fandema sind darauf ausgerichtet,
die Armut in der Gesellschaft zu mindern. Fandema bedeutet in der lokalen Mandinka-
Sprache “Hilf dir selbst”.

Zusätzlich zum Unterricht, in dem Grundwissen in Sprachen, Computeranwendung und
Betriebswirtschaft vermittelt wird, bauen und installieren Frauenteams Solarstromsysteme
und schaffen schöne Kunstobjekte und Qualitätsprodukte, die vermarktet werden können. Es
gibt Kurse für Nähen, Modedesign, Textilkunde, Druck- und Siebdruckverfahren,
Geburtshilfe, ökologische Nachhaltigkeit, Hotel- und Restaurant- sowie Ökotourismus-
Management. Der Weg zu einer beruflichen Laufbahn in der Musikbranche und in der
Unterhaltungsindustrie wird den jungen Frauen als nächstes angeboten werden.

Aber wie soll das finanziert werden? Leider erhalten diese Frauen und Mädchen in Gambia
keinerlei finanzielle Unterstützung. Die Teilnahme an den Programmen von Fandema ist
kostenlos, wenn die Teilnehmerinnen ihre Kurse abschließen. Nur, wenn sie die Kurse
vorzeitig verlassen, müssen sie für die Materialien zahlen, die sie bis dahin verbraucht
haben. Was das Musikprogramm betrifft, so verfügt das Center jetzt über ein paar sehr
minderwertige Instrumente, die nicht lange halten werden. Die Hälfte der Gitarren, die ich im
Supermarkt gekauft hatte, hat das Ende meines Workshops nicht lange überlebt. 









Ich kehrte nach Deutschland zurück in der Überzeugung, eine Spender-Organisation zu
finden, die das Projekt finanzieren würde. Die Realität holte mich bald ein. Ich bin eine
vielbeschäftigte Musikerin und Musiklehrerin. Davon, wie man Geld sammelt, habe ich keine
Ahnung. Angesichts all der Formalien, die erfüllt sein müssen, um Projektzuschüsse zu
erhalten, und der dafür erforderlichen sprachlichen Voraussetzungen fühlte ich mich
vollkommen entmutigt. Ich besitze keinen gemeinnützigen Status. Hinsichtlich meiner
Ausbildung und Erfahrung bin ich ganz besonders qualifiziert, dieses Projekt zu unterstützen,
aber ich bin nur eine einzelne Person mit einer Vision.

Ich beschloss zu tun, was mir möglich ist. Ich schrieb ein paar Songs und nahm eine neue
CD auf. Jetzt führe ich eine Crowdfunding-Kampagne, in der ich meine Musik als
Gegenleistung für Spenden anbiete, und hoffe, dass ich damit genug Geld sammeln kann,
um das erste Jahr der ersten Rockschule für Frauen in Westafrika zu finanzieren! 












Die Idee ist, Musikunterricht mit Musik zu finanzieren. Meine brandneue Soloaufnahme heißt
“Far and Wide”. Sie enthält eine Sammlung von Reise- und Liebesliedern. Dieses Album
veröffentliche ich vorab exklusiv im Rahmen dieser Kampagne. Alle Einnahmen daraus
werden in die Finanzierung der GALs fließen. Würden alle 2000 CDs der ersten Auflage
abgerufen werden, könnte allein das die Betriebskosten des ersten Jahres tragen,
einschließlich Instrumente, Materialien und Transport. Ich investiere meine Musik, meine
Zeit, mein Know-how und mein ganzes Herz in das erste Jahr, um das Projekt auf den Weg
zu bringen. Und ich bin zuversichtlich, dass die Ergebnisse, die wir nach einem Jahr erzielt
haben werden, genug Unterstützung nach sich ziehen werden, um die folgenden Jahre zu
finanzieren. Außer meiner CD biete ich auch noch anderes an: Live-Auftritte, T-Shirts,
Downloads und weitere Musikartikel. 












Ich bitte um Ihre Mithilfe! Bitte unterstützen Sie dieses Projekt, indem Sie meine CD und
andere Artikel erwerben, einen Live-Auftritt buchen und spenden, so viel Sie können. Und
auch wenn Sie nicht spenden können, bitte teilen Sie den Kampagne-Link mit Ihren
Freunden und in Netzwerken, die Interesse haben könnten, eine musikalische
Grundausbildung und ""The Groovy African Ladies Music School"" zu unterstützen.

<p>Im Steph, the author of Laila and Habib: Adventures in Jordan. I am originally from the UK but now call Petra, Jordan home. </p>
<p>Since arriving in Jordan I have dreamed to create a community project and play my part in a community that has accepted and supported from day 1. Alongside writing Laila and Habib, I run A Piece of Jordan, a community initiative engaging visitors with everyday life beyond the typical tourist trail (you can see more about A Piece of Jordan here <a href=""http://www.apieceofjordan.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.apieceofjordan.com</a>). </p>
<p>My plans for the women and children's centre began after we moved back to Jordan from the UK with our son Karam. There is no doubt that the natural elements of Petra provide amazing adventures for children but I wanted to also add a new dimension and option for families here. I also want to create a cafe for women as there is currently nothing of the sort in Petra.</p>
<p>When I began to think of ways to fund the centre I fell in love with the idea of creating imformative but fun stories for young travelers and indeed for children all over the world. I see these books as another way to show the real Jordan to the world, celebrate its history, culture and engage young families when the travel here. I also plan to create a English language program here in Petra using Laila and Habib. </p>
<p>I look forward to sharing your jouney with us!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am planning to write stories on various cities, sites and parts of Jordanian life - we currently have Petra complete with illustrations and Amman and Dana written. In order to get our illustrations put into the correct graphic design format and the physical book designed we have been qouted 70GBP per page. Which means each book is likely to cost 1000GBP for the design process. Once this is complete printing costs will be in the realm of 2GBP per book.</p>
<p>We would love for you to help us get the ball rolling - we have recieved written support from the Ministry of Culture, who have offered to publish the book!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our target for this campaign the money will be set aside so that we can keep fundraising until we reach our target and get the first book design complete and ready for print</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Jordan is a very misunderstood part of the world, through Laila and Habib's stories I feel we can continue to combat and fight the stereotypes of the region through storytelling!</p>

Nhà hàng đáp ứng nhu cầu thưởng thức món ăn Nhật với chất lượng và hương vị chuẩn mực của ẩm thực Nhật Bản. Các đầu bếp của nhà hàng đều có nhiều năm kinh nghiệm làm việc và đặc biệt có thời gian tu nghiệp tại Nhật Bản. Bên cạnh đó, nhà hàng hỗ trợ đào tạo nghề bếp cho thanh niên có hoàn cảnh khó khăn, bao gồm nạn nhân của buôn bán người, thanh niên nghèo, thanh niên bỏ học sớm, hay thanh niên dân tộc thiểu số đến từ vùng núi với điều kiện sống khó khăn.Dự án này là sự hợp tác giữa REACH và đơn vị phát triển nhà hàng Setsugekka, với sự hỗ trợ của Bộ Kinh Tế, Thương Mại và Công Nghiệp Nhật Bản (METI), và trường đào tạo ẩm thực Tsuji tại thành phố Osaka. Đầu bếp 7 sao Michelin nổi tiếng thế giới Yoshihiro Murata cũng có những đóng góp cho dự án này.What We Need/ Chúng tôi cần bạn hỗ trợWe need at least $40,000 to help with the setup of our project. This money will help fund:
The recruitment and training of our restaurant's head chefs and classroom cooking teachers
The equipment needed for our new industrial kitchen
Tuition and training materials needed for our cooking students and restaurant trainees
Fit out costs for training restaurant, including rent, refurbishment and décor
---Chúng tôi cần ít nhất $40,000 để có thể thực hiện được dự án này. Số tiền gây được sẽ được dùng để:    1.  Tuyển dụng và đào tạo cho đội ngũ đầu bếp và giáo viên đứng lớp dạy cho các học viên    2. Mua các trang thiết bị.    3. Chi phí đào tạo, nguyên vật liệu thực hành cho các học viên.    4. Cải tạo, trang trí lại nhà hàng.The Perks/ Quyền lợi tài trợWe are offering a diverse range of perks to help you get the most out of your investment in our project. Our perks vary according to the amount and your location (we have tailored specific packages to those investors based within and outside of Vietnam).Whether you want to hear from one of our students in a hand-written thank you card, have your name on our Restaurant Honour Board or receive an invite to our launch event next year, there is something here for everyone. Every dollar counts and we appreciate every contribution. Even for a minimal amount, you can change the life of a student.---Có những gói quyền lợi khác nhau để ghi nhận sự đóng góp của nhà tài trợ cho dự án, bao gồm thư cảm ơn viết tay từ học viên REACH, ghi tên trên bản tường danh dự của nhà hàng, hay vé mời tham dự  lễ khai trương của nhà hàng. Chúng tôi trân trọng mọi sự đóng góp, dù là nhỏ nhất. Cùng nhau, chúng ta có thể đem lại sự đổi thay trong cuộc sống của thanh niên có hoàn cảnh khó khăn Việt Nam. The Impact/ Tác động của dự ánDespite the growing popularity of Japanese food all around the globe, the number of Japanese cuisine chefs is actually decreasing as less and less young Japanese are entering the profession. REACH sees this market dislocation as a tremendous market opportunity it can capture and leverage to further its mission to help disadvantaged youth in Vietnam.REACH's award-winning vocational training, life skills and job placement programs target Vietnam's most disadvantaged youth, including human trafficking and domestic violence victims, ethnic minorities, youth with a disability, youth with or affected by HIV/AIDS, rural migrants, and youth living in poverty. With around 1.4 million workers entering Vietnam’s labour market each year, it is these vulnerable groups that are being left behind, unable to grasp opportunities for prosperity.In line with REACH's current training cycle, we will host three intakes of students in 2017 alone, totalling between 60-80 students. Each student will be provided with technical training, life skills training and work-readiness training in preparation for a traineeship at our restaurant, where they will be mentored and guided by head chefs who have received capacity building support from the Tsuji Culinary Institute in Osaka, Japan.---Dự án hướng tới giúp đỡ những thanh niên có hoàn cảnh khó khăn nhất của Việt Nam , bao gồm thanh niên nghèo, thanh niên bỏ học sớm, thanh niên dân tộc thiểu số, nạn nhân của buôn bán người và bạo lực gia đình, thanh niên khuyết tật, hoặc thanh niên sống chung/ bị ảnh hưởng bởi HIV/AIDS. Đây là nhóm đối tượng dễ bị tổn thương, không có khả năng kiếm việc trong thị trường lao động đầy cạnh tranh.Nhà hàng đào tạo Nhật Bản trong năm 2017 dự kiến sẽ hỗ trợ từ 60-80 thanh niên. Các học viên sẽ được các đầu bếp giàu kinh nghiệm từng đi tu nghiệp tại Nhật Bản trực tiếp hướng dẫn. Risks & ChallengesThis restaurant shows REACH embarking on a new challenge to expand its social entrepreneurship portfolio by setting up a Japanese cuisine training restaurant in Hanoi. We know this is new territory, which is why we've chosen our partners carefully. Each partner will bring different expertise to the table:Michelin Star Chef Yoshihiro MurataDeclaring his life’s work as “accurately communicating Japanese cuisine to the world” and “cooking for the public benefit”, 7-Michelin Star Chef Yoshihiro Murata will be providing input on curriculum development, restaurant development, and menu and recipe development. Tsuji Culinary InstituteTo support the training of disadvantaged Vietnamese youth to become skilled Japanese chefs, Tsuji will provide capacity building, curriculum development and training support, overseen by the head trainer.SetsugekkaWith the support of Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), Setsugekka is providing a restaurant development plan, corporate advisory and seed-funding for the project.REACHREACH will utilise its NGO network and connection with Vietnam’s most disadvantaged communities (including domestic violence and human trafficking victims, youth with a disability, youth affected by HIV/AIDS, ethnic minorities, rural youth, youth living in poverty, amongst others) to recruit vulnerable and marginalized youth to join this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.Other Ways You Can HelpPlease help us spread the word about our campaign, whether through WOM or by sharing our campaign page on social media.

<h2>About the Campaign</h2>
<p>Sub-Saharan Africa is slated to double in population to 2.3 billion people by 2050, at which time <strong>40% of the world’s children will be in this region</strong>.</p>
<p>Many talented, ambitious young people will be moving from rural areas into cities by way of informal settlements, such as Kibera, where Tunapanda Institute’s main training facility is located. This urbanization poses a problem if learning and working opportunities are not provided at a high enough quality and quantity.</p>
<p>The Tunapanda Team, all of whom are graduates of our free 3-month training programs in the past 4 years, will:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Set up a first-of-it's-kind space training location</strong> in Kibera to re-imagine how people can live together in tight situations and encourage kids to think about space travel and Earth-focused problem solving.</li>
<li>
<strong>Iteratively develop up to 9 new open source micro-courses</strong>.<strong> Test each with 40-50 kids and young people in Kibera</strong>. Each video-driven micro-course will cost the Tunapanda team $4,000-$7,000 to develop and test, which includes some of the costs to keep our team fed and safe while they run our flagship free 3-month training programs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tunapanda's model is centered around financial sustainability - our team earns money by building websites, performing HCD-inspired research or usability testing, and training services for individuals and corporate clients. These open source courses can become revenue-generators for us and others around the world.</p>

<h2>KASA's Potential Impact</h2>
<p><strong>We see an opportunity to unlock imaginations about space travel while also solving problems here on Earth. </strong>Some current space exploration programs plan to send millions of people to Mars within several decades, and the key constraint to space travel will not only be the rocket science: but rather, it will be how we can use scarce resources (including physical space) to keep people alive and happy. There are clear parallels to the crowded informal settlements of cities around Africa, and we can thus create impact here on Earth while preparing for exciting space adventures.</p>
<p>Tunapanda Institute has been developing and testing openly-licensed “micro-courses” that can be used for free or paid training by anyone through short bootcamps. For example, we recently ran a robotics bootcamp using a micro-course we created earlier this year (see video below).</p>
<p><strong>Tunapanda Institute wishes to create an initial 9 micro-courses and test them with young people through our partners here in Kibera</strong>, before releasing them for free to the world so that others can also get involved in re-imagining the future of humanity, here on Earth as well as in outer space.</p>

<h2>What we will teach</h2>
<p>The curricula we will develop will combine the future with current needs to ensure that learners are at learning skills that can help them to generate income and become changemakers for their generation. Broken down into 9 broad categories, the learning will be based on important and emerging issues in today's world. By keeping in mind how technologies can be used in space exploration, as well as how they are relevant locally, our students can dream big while also having an impact. See the FAQ to learn how you can support a topic that you care about.</p>
<h3>1. Robotics and human-computer interaction</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543305414/c9jdyqxueoebrqrbldsb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As more and more tasks become automated and machines take a more active role in our daily lives, an essential component of building the future will be designing these machines and thinking about our interaction with them. Learning how to design and operate robots through computer programming is a growing field, and we have already run robotics courses for kids in Kibera to great enthusiasm. We want to continue developing these skills to ensure that the robots and machines that we use in the future align with our values and are used to make the world better for future generations.</p>
<h3>2. Energy sources of the future</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543305467/roux2s1csgywegapxyok.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Creating efficient and sustainable energy systems will continue to be important to the future of the earth, as the population of humans will keep on rising. Better energy systems will allow every community, even in marginalized areas, to have access to clean energy. The systems that we shall develop will be useful on earth, space, and other planets. To enable this to happen, the learners will have to understand, design, create and repair this energy generation, distribution and storage systems.</p>
<h3>3. Governance and decision making</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543315452/x6axpgiqgkyrygg0oe0j.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The future of work and education are rapidly changing, making teamwork and communication more important than ever. We will all need to take part in different teams and work in different workplace cultures to become successful leaders and teammates. The best way to become adaptable is to learn the background of governance and decision-making and how new models, such as Holacracy, Teal, and cryptocurrency protocols work. Learners will partake in practical workshops to learn how to work with teams of various sizes and board games that will help us to learn strategies, tactics, and flexibility to changing situations. Pure centralization creates corrupt and slow companies and dictatorship governments. Pure decentralization creates slow decision-making and weak companies and countries. With modern technology and an emphasis on education, we can invent new ways to organize and make decisions.</p>
<h3>4. The future of food</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543305504/prmmtdfyev5b1b899lvn.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The way we currently feed our planet is not sustainable - if we can innovate where and how we grow food, as well as thinking critically about nutrition and what we eat, we can do better at feeding our species, both on this planet and the next. Learners will learn about new techniques and strategies for growing sustainable food sources in various locations (such as dense urban areas) and in varying climates. They will also learn the basics of nutrition so that they can feed themselves, their families, and their communities in a healthier way.</p>
<h3>5. Communications and Satellites</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543305517/cif3a1crp2avcenxz1mz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In Africa communication has evolved from traditional methods such as drums and smoke to modern technology such as mobile phones and computers. IoT (Internet of Things) is one of the biggest frontiers that is improving our lives. Devices and systems that were previously unable to communicate are now connecting and making real-word decisions. Satellites enable faster and more data collection, and understanding the progress and future of communication technologies is very important. Learners will get skills to solve challenges such as access to clean water, medical monitoring, smart housing, and many others.  Tunapanda has already started building a community network, TunapandaNET, promoting digital inclusion through affordable access to connectivity and started local youth in Kibera on the path of becoming network and software engineers.</p>

<h3>6. Buildings of the future</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543305532/w9l2rfs0oeyuovh3u5ws.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Physical spaces have a large influence on the way that people interact within them. In areas of dense and sparse populations, thinking critically about how we design our environments can have a huge impact.  As we design the future, we will need to design interior and exterior spaces to be functional, safe, and beautiful. We will engage with adults and kids to learn how to build spaces that allow them to tap into their full potential and inspire growth, creativity, and imagination.  Support this project to bring the future closer to hearts through our spaces and buildings.</p>
<h3>7. Rockets and the history of space exploration</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543305546/uqqszt4omnmpmjxc5xgw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In the 20th century, scientists and visionaries sent humans and our technology off to explore the cosmos. We collaborated not only to explore but also to discover our world and what lies beyond. Understanding the science behind rockets through experimentation and prototyping for kids is not only beneficial for school but can also be used to understand how to tackle real-world problems.  We will focus on using creative imagination, peer-to-peer learning, and working in teams to shape our path to space. “It’s not rocket science, it’s just fun”</p>
<h3>8. STEM</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543305560/mhtpr2j2hrqaiegtwvfg.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The challenges we are facing today are more complex and sophisticated, and current schooling systems often not prepare kids to solve all of them effectively. The future of education should be about practical skill acquisition, not just exams and rote memorization. Learners of all ages will be introduced to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) courses. The learning will be heavily project-based and focused on problem-solving to that students learn the real world applications of the material they are memorizing at school. Kids learning STEM can start applying math and science concepts through prototyping new ideas, which will enable them to develop solutions on how to take and sustain mankind on other planets, while simultaneously improving this one.</p>
<h3>9. Staring Into Space</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543309554/ay21xijfacteplob0nqe.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>For thousands of years, people have watched the sky to try and find their place in this world.</p>
<p>This has given us insights into where we come from and where we can go. Getting an understanding of the vastness of outer space helps to put things into perspective about how we can spend our time here on Earth. Giving kids in Kibera the opportunity to use telescopes and other tools to learn about space first hand will create an amazing opportunity for inspiration and creativity. In overnight excursions or camps, they can broaden their horizons, experience a connection with nature, and learn mindfulness and other skills that will assist them to achieve their dreams. We will give kids the opportunity to stare into space, which will allow them to dream big and find their place in this world, and the future we build together.</p>

<h2>About Tunapanda Institute</h2>
<p><a href=""http://www.tunapanda.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tunapanda Institute</a> has been spreading knowledge across East Africa for six years. Its first project was an ‘education on a hard drive’ in 2012. Co-founders/brothers Jay and Mick Larson set up several computer laboratories in Kenya, Uganda &amp; Tanzania and installed hundreds of gigabytes of free video courses and software in areas where internet costs are prohibitively high for online learning.</p>
<p>In 2014, they set up a school in Africa’s largest slum, Kibera. In 2016, graduates of Tunapanda's Kibera facility helped to set up another learning center in Kenya’s northern region of Turkana.

<h3>Kibera Aeronautics and Space Academy (KASA)</h3>
<p>In 2019, Tunapanda is going to keep pushing its vision of accessible and relevant training programs by launching the Kibera Aeronautics and Space Academy. KASA will be located within walking distance from our main training facility and will be a hub for inspiring young people to dream and tackle the problems of the future. With a focus on how we can make humans an interplanetary species, the project-based learning will also allow young people to tackle problems here on Earth. In the coming years, we will have many challenges to face, and KASA wants to inspire young people here in Kibera to come up with solutions.</p>
<p>Tunapanda team members, almost all of whom are beneficiaries of our free 3-month training courses, will create and publish curricula that will allow young people to take the first steps in creating these solutions. These curricula will be open and available for anyone, anywhere to access and get the same learning.  We will build off of our introductory training program to focus on some of the key issues that could have a hand in shaping the future.</p>

</div></div>","About the Campaign
Sub-Saharan Africa is slated to double in population to 2.3 billion people by 2050, at which time 40% of the world’s children will be in this region.
Many talented, ambitious young people will be moving from rural areas into cities by way of informal settlements, such as Kibera, where Tunapanda Institute’s main training facility is located. This urbanization poses a problem if learning and working opportunities are not provided at a high enough quality and quantity.
The Tunapanda Team, all of whom are graduates of our free 3-month training programs in the past 4 years, will:


Set up a first-of-it's-kind space training location in Kibera to re-imagine how people can live together in tight situations and encourage kids to think about space travel and Earth-focused problem solving.

Iteratively develop up to 9 new open source micro-courses. Test each with 40-50 kids and young people in Kibera. Each video-driven micro-course will cost the Tunapanda team $4,000-$7,000 to develop and test, which includes some of the costs to keep our team fed and safe while they run our flagship free 3-month training programs.

Tunapanda's model is centered around financial sustainability - our team earns money by building websites, performing HCD-inspired research or usability testing, and training services for individuals and corporate clients. These open source courses can become revenue-generators for us and others around the world.

KASA's Potential Impact
We see an opportunity to unlock imaginations about space travel while also solving problems here on Earth. Some current space exploration programs plan to send millions of people to Mars within several decades, and the key constraint to space travel will not only be the rocket science: but rather, it will be how we can use scarce resources (including physical space) to keep people alive and happy. There are clear parallels to the crowded informal settlements of cities around Africa, and we can thus create impact here on Earth while preparing for exciting space adventures.
Tunapanda Institute has been developing and testing openly-licensed “micro-courses” that can be used for free or paid training by anyone through short bootcamps. For example, we recently ran a robotics bootcamp using a micro-course we created earlier this year (see video below).
Tunapanda Institute wishes to create an initial 9 micro-courses and test them with young people through our partners here in Kibera, before releasing them for free to the world so that others can also get involved in re-imagining the future of humanity, here on Earth as well as in outer space.
 

KASA’s Key Areas of Training Will Include:

 

Previous Micro-Course: Robotics

What we will teach
The curricula we will develop will combine the future with current needs to ensure that learners are at learning skills that can help them to generate income and become changemakers for their generation. Broken down into 9 broad categories, the learning will be based on important and emerging issues in today's world. By keeping in mind how technologies can be used in space exploration, as well as how they are relevant locally, our students can dream big while also having an impact. See the FAQ to learn how you can support a topic that you care about.
1. Robotics and human-computer interaction

As more and more tasks become automated and machines take a more active role in our daily lives, an essential component of building the future will be designing these machines and thinking about our interaction with them. Learning how to design and operate robots through computer programming is a growing field, and we have already run robotics courses for kids in Kibera to great enthusiasm. We want to continue developing these skills to ensure that the robots and machines that we use in the future align with our values and are used to make the world better for future generations.
2. Energy sources of the future

Creating efficient and sustainable energy systems will continue to be important to the future of the earth, as the population of humans will keep on rising. Better energy systems will allow every community, even in marginalized areas, to have access to clean energy. The systems that we shall develop will be useful on earth, space, and other planets. To enable this to happen, the learners will have to understand, design, create and repair this energy generation, distribution and storage systems.
3. Governance and decision making

The future of work and education are rapidly changing, making teamwork and communication more important than ever. We will all need to take part in different teams and work in different workplace cultures to become successful leaders and teammates. The best way to become adaptable is to learn the background of governance and decision-making and how new models, such as Holacracy, Teal, and cryptocurrency protocols work. Learners will partake in practical workshops to learn how to work with teams of various sizes and board games that will help us to learn strategies, tactics, and flexibility to changing situations. Pure centralization creates corrupt and slow companies and dictatorship governments. Pure decentralization creates slow decision-making and weak companies and countries. With modern technology and an emphasis on education, we can invent new ways to organize and make decisions.
4. The future of food

The way we currently feed our planet is not sustainable - if we can innovate where and how we grow food, as well as thinking critically about nutrition and what we eat, we can do better at feeding our species, both on this planet and the next. Learners will learn about new techniques and strategies for growing sustainable food sources in various locations (such as dense urban areas) and in varying climates. They will also learn the basics of nutrition so that they can feed themselves, their families, and their communities in a healthier way.
5. Communications and Satellites

In Africa communication has evolved from traditional methods such as drums and smoke to modern technology such as mobile phones and computers. IoT (Internet of Things) is one of the biggest frontiers that is improving our lives. Devices and systems that were previously unable to communicate are now connecting and making real-word decisions. Satellites enable faster and more data collection, and understanding the progress and future of communication technologies is very important. Learners will get skills to solve challenges such as access to clean water, medical monitoring, smart housing, and many others.  Tunapanda has already started building a community network, TunapandaNET, promoting digital inclusion through affordable access to connectivity and started local youth in Kibera on the path of becoming network and software engineers.

 
6. Buildings of the future

Physical spaces have a large influence on the way that people interact within them. In areas of dense and sparse populations, thinking critically about how we design our environments can have a huge impact.  As we design the future, we will need to design interior and exterior spaces to be functional, safe, and beautiful. We will engage with adults and kids to learn how to build spaces that allow them to tap into their full potential and inspire growth, creativity, and imagination.  Support this project to bring the future closer to hearts through our spaces and buildings.
7. Rockets and the history of space exploration

In the 20th century, scientists and visionaries sent humans and our technology off to explore the cosmos. We collaborated not only to explore but also to discover our world and what lies beyond. Understanding the science behind rockets through experimentation and prototyping for kids is not only beneficial for school but can also be used to understand how to tackle real-world problems.  We will focus on using creative imagination, peer-to-peer learning, and working in teams to shape our path to space. “It’s not rocket science, it’s just fun”
8. STEM

The challenges we are facing today are more complex and sophisticated, and current schooling systems often not prepare kids to solve all of them effectively. The future of education should be about practical skill acquisition, not just exams and rote memorization. Learners of all ages will be introduced to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) courses. The learning will be heavily project-based and focused on problem-solving to that students learn the real world applications of the material they are memorizing at school. Kids learning STEM can start applying math and science concepts through prototyping new ideas, which will enable them to develop solutions on how to take and sustain mankind on other planets, while simultaneously improving this one.
9. Staring Into Space

For thousands of years, people have watched the sky to try and find their place in this world.
This has given us insights into where we come from and where we can go. Getting an understanding of the vastness of outer space helps to put things into perspective about how we can spend our time here on Earth. Giving kids in Kibera the opportunity to use telescopes and other tools to learn about space first hand will create an amazing opportunity for inspiration and creativity. In overnight excursions or camps, they can broaden their horizons, experience a connection with nature, and learn mindfulness and other skills that will assist them to achieve their dreams. We will give kids the opportunity to stare into space, which will allow them to dream big and find their place in this world, and the future we build together.
 
About Tunapanda Institute
Tunapanda Institute has been spreading knowledge across East Africa for six years. Its first project was an ‘education on a hard drive’ in 2012. Co-founders/brothers Jay and Mick Larson set up several computer laboratories in Kenya, Uganda & Tanzania and installed hundreds of gigabytes of free video courses and software in areas where internet costs are prohibitively high for online learning.
In 2014, they set up a school in Africa’s largest slum, Kibera. In 2016, graduates of Tunapanda's Kibera facility helped to set up another learning center in Kenya’s northern region of Turkana. So far, we have trained over 300 students in technology, design, and business skills. Graduates have gone on to use their skills as skilled employees, freelancers, and entrepreneurs.
In 2016, Tunapanda was named as one the 2016 NT100 – Nominet Trust ’s annual celebration of 100 inspiring tech-for-good ventures from around the world.
At Tunapanda, we strive to take our work seriously without taking ourselves too seriously. In 2014, we crowd-funded the launch of our Kibera training facility with a comedy video, ""Tunapanda News"" inspired by shows like The Daily Show. Now, in 2018, we created ""Tunapanda News 2"" to assure people that we still take our work seriously, and still don't take ourselves too seriously. We hope you enjoy it:

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Overview</h3>
<p>We are Yonder Dynamics, a multidisciplinary student robotics organization from the University of California, San Diego. Since the formation of our organization in 2016, we have been competing in the annual University Rover Challenge (URC), an international collegiate-level competition in which teams from around the world design and build an autonomous Mars rover. In the final round of competition, teams must complete the following four missions: Science Mission, Extreme Retrieval and Delivery Mission, Equipment Servicing Mission, and Autonomous Traversal Mission. These missions are held in Hanksville, a small town in Utah that features a Mars-like terrain for researchers and students to simulate their ideas for the Red Planet. You can read more about the competition by clicking on their website <a href=""http://urc.marssociety.org/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. </p>

<p>What we've achieved so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Last year, we were one of the 36 teams out of 95 entries to make it to the final round of competition</li>
<li>We made UC San Diego history by making it into the final round two years in a row</li>
<li>We were the only school in the UC system to make both the 2017 and 2018 final rounds</li>
</ul>
<p>With your support in funding, we can build a rover that will far surpass the results we've achieved so far. Our goal for this year's competition is to place among one of the top ten teams.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Project</h3>
<p>We design and manufacture all aspects of the Mars rover. However, the necessary parts and software are not cheap, even with the help of our generous sponsors. By donating to Yonder Dynamics, you will be contributing to the funding that is necessary to purchase rover parts and fund the trip to URC, should we make it to the final round. Yonder members are eagerly taking on the competition's challenge to ""design and build the next generation of Mars rovers that will one day work alongside human explorers in the field"", and we cannot do this without your help. </p>

<p>Based on what we've learned from trial and error through the past two competitions, team members have already created the designs that will eliminate previous inaccuracies. We are currently constructing and perfecting the new rover that will get us further above the competition. </p>
<p><strong>The 2019 Rover: What our subteams are working on</strong></p>
<p><i>Motions</i>: During the design process, the motions team made sure to integrate our systems by collaborating, and communicating closely. We use Solidworks for CAD and Google Drive File Stream to manage our data across our relatively large team of about 40 people. Compared to last year, all of our components will be machined to substantially higher specifications than ever before.<br/><br/>We’re depending on the drivetrain and chassis’s reliability, off road ability, and precise movement for every task in the competition. The suspension worked well last year, so we used that design as a foundation to improve upon. We completely redesigned the chassis out of carbon fiber and aluminum tubing and the back two wheel’s shock absorption system has an improved range of motion.<br/><br/>Moving on from our linear actuator design last year, we decided to challenge ourselves this year by using multiple belt pulley systems to actuate our arm. Each belt pulley system is responsible for rotating the whole arm, the lower arm, and the upper arm. We have incorporated turnbuckles into our belts for quick of our belts’ tensions. In addition, our arm has taken advantage of carbon fiber tubing for lowering weight while maintaining structural integrity.</p>
<p><i>Electrical</i>: Electrical is designing a power budget based on the all electrical components to ensure power is maintained at all times during competition. Our focus will include motors and motor drivers selection, and designing an interactive printed circuit board for the software components. We are currently testing frequencies (900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz) to transmit our telemetry, controls, and video feed, as well as choosing types of antennas and radios to use. Further testing will include max power draw by each rover component with a focus on the drive train and arm to determine ideal operating point for competition.</p>
<p><i>Software</i>: The University Rover Challenge is the most interesting programming challenge given to college students because of the autonomous traversal challenge. Our rover needs to find tennis balls hidden in the Utah desert autonomously, which is a surprisingly difficult problem composed of three main sections. The challenges are state estimation (figuring out where you are), obstacle avoidance (mapping the environment and generating safe paths), and efficient exploration. The first two are solvable problems and the software team will be learning to apply an extended Kalman filter to our sensor setup and modifying A* for our situation. However, for efficient exploration, the literature is very light and the software team has designed a novel solution to the problem and plans to maybe even publish a paper based on our results.</p>
<p><i>Science</i>: The science team is responsible for tackling the soil analysis portion of the competition. Our task is to design and build a system to collect soil from the ground, deposit it into a sampling container, and carryout the necessary experiments to determine the presence of life using a number of techniques. Currently, we are utilizing a microbiological assaywhich monitors the turbidity of a sample over time to detect the presence of extant life. Also, we are using Raman spectroscopy to detect cellular carotenoids produced by some known extremophiles to search for extinct life.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p>We have a diverse organization with members that come from all different types of backgrounds with various majors, from Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering to International Business and Communications. With so many members that specialize in individualized subjects, Yonder Dynamics is divided into five main subteams: Software, Motions, Science, Electrical, and Business. </p>
<p>Although Yonder Dynamics is only a three-year old organization, we have created so much impact among the undergraduate students that are a part of the rover-building process. Members are hands-on with every single step, from the raw design and creating CADs to drilling and constructing the rover together. We are one of the few groups on campus where students have the opportunity to enjoy scientific research and inquiry on their own merit, giving them valuable professional skills they can use for lab positions, internships, and even future careers. </p>
<p><i>A member working on this year's rover:</i></p>

<p>More importantly, members create strong bonds that transform into life-long friendships. We love working with each other and regularly enjoy events that build our teamwork, such as a bonfire night filled with s'mores or a relaxing weekend retreat in the snow. Our philosophy is ""People First"", meaning we strongly believe in developing each of our members as individuals before anything else. We're all united by one thing - our passion for robotics and space. </p>

<p>The University Rover Challenge has several rounds that teams must pass in order to continue on to the final round in Hanksville. Competition is tough, and more than half of the teams that applied for URC will be cut though the Systems Acceptance Review (SAR). </p>
<p>For the last two years of competition, we have narrowly made it into the final round of competition among the ranks of the 30+ teams that are accepted. Although we are still learning from previous mistakes, we have made it our goal to confidently pass the SAR by creating a completed rover system that will demonstrate the fruits of our hard labor.</p>
<p>Should we not make it past the Systems Acceptance Review round and are unable to move forward to the final round of competition, we will still complete the construction and testing of our rover. Indiegogo rewards will also still be fulfilled as promised.</p>

By donating to Yonder Dynamics, you will be contributing to the funding that is necessary to purchase rover parts and fund the trip to URC, should we make it to the final round. Yonder members are eagerly taking on the competition's challenge to ""design and build the next generation of Mars rovers that will one day work alongside human explorers in the field"", and we cannot do this without your help. 
Procyon, our 2018 rover:

Based on what we've learned from trial and error through the past two competitions, team members have already created the designs that will eliminate previous inaccuracies. We are currently constructing and perfecting the new rover that will get us further above the competition. 
The 2019 Rover: What our subteams are working on
Motions: During the design process, the motions team made sure to integrate our systems by collaborating, and communicating closely. We use Solidworks for CAD and Google Drive File Stream to manage our data across our relatively large team of about 40 people. Compared to last year, all of our components will be machined to substantially higher specifications than ever before.We’re depending on the drivetrain and chassis’s reliability, off road ability, and precise movement for every task in the competition. The suspension worked well last year, so we used that design as a foundation to improve upon. We completely redesigned the chassis out of carbon fiber and aluminum tubing and the back two wheel’s shock absorption system has an improved range of motion.Moving on from our linear actuator design last year, we decided to challenge ourselves this year by using multiple belt pulley systems to actuate our arm. Each belt pulley system is responsible for rotating the whole arm, the lower arm, and the upper arm. We have incorporated turnbuckles into our belts for quick of our belts’ tensions. In addition, our arm has taken advantage of carbon fiber tubing for lowering weight while maintaining structural integrity.
Electrical: Electrical is designing a power budget based on the all electrical components to ensure power is maintained at all times during competition. Our focus will include motors and motor drivers selection, and designing an interactive printed circuit board for the software components. We are currently testing frequencies (900 MHz, 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz) to transmit our telemetry, controls, and video feed, as well as choosing types of antennas and radios to use. Further testing will include max power draw by each rover component with a focus on the drive train and arm to determine ideal operating point for competition.
Software: The University Rover Challenge is the most interesting programming challenge given to college students because of the autonomous traversal challenge. Our rover needs to find tennis balls hidden in the Utah desert autonomously, which is a surprisingly difficult problem composed of three main sections. The challenges are state estimation (figuring out where you are), obstacle avoidance (mapping the environment and generating safe paths), and efficient exploration. The first two are solvable problems and the software team will be learning to apply an extended Kalman filter to our sensor setup and modifying A* for our situation. However, for efficient exploration, the literature is very light and the software team has designed a novel solution to the problem and plans to maybe even publish a paper based on our results.
Science: The science team is responsible for tackling the soil analysis portion of the competition. Our task is to design and build a system to collect soil from the ground, deposit it into a sampling container, and carryout the necessary experiments to determine the presence of life using a number of techniques. Currently, we are utilizing a microbiological assaywhich monitors the turbidity of a sample over time to detect the presence of extant life. Also, we are using Raman spectroscopy to detect cellular carotenoids produced by some known extremophiles to search for extinct life. 

The Impact
We have a diverse organization with members that come from all different types of backgrounds with various majors, from Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering to International Business and Communications. With so many members that specialize in individualized subjects, Yonder Dynamics is divided into five main subteams: Software, Motions, Science, Electrical, and Business. 
Although Yonder Dynamics is only a three-year old organization, we have created so much impact among the undergraduate students that are a part of the rover-building process. Members are hands-on with every single step, from the raw design and creating CADs to drilling and constructing the rover together. We are one of the few groups on campus where students have the opportunity to enjoy scientific research and inquiry on their own merit, giving them valuable professional skills they can use for lab positions, internships, and even future careers. 
A member working on this year's rover:

More importantly, members create strong bonds that transform into life-long friendships. We love working with each other and regularly enjoy events that build our teamwork, such as a bonfire night filled with s'mores or a relaxing weekend retreat in the snow. Our philosophy is ""People First"", meaning we strongly believe in developing each of our members as individuals before anything else. We're all united by one thing - our passion for robotics and space.

Risks & Challenges
The University Rover Challenge has several rounds that teams must pass in order to continue on to the final round in Hanksville. Competition is tough, and more than half of the teams that applied for URC will be cut though the Systems Acceptance Review (SAR). 
For the last two years of competition, we have narrowly made it into the final round of competition among the ranks of the 30+ teams that are accepted. Although we are still learning from previous mistakes, we have made it our goal to confidently pass the SAR by creating a completed rover system that will demonstrate the fruits of our hard labor.
Should we not make it past the Systems Acceptance Review round and are unable to move forward to the final round of competition, we will still complete the construction and testing of our rover. Indiegogo rewards will also still be fulfilled as promised.

</div></div>","Meet Chatterbox, the educational smart speaker that puts privacy first
Chatterbox is the world's first educational build-it-yourself, program-it-yourself smart speaker kit for kids that puts privacy first.
Think of it like an Amazon Alexa or Siri, but one focused on privacy that kids can build and program to bring their creativity to life.

A HUGE thank you to Hackster.io for interviewing us and taking the time to learn about Chatterbox, our beginnings and our future.

Why learn about AI?
Computers of the future will be voice-driven artificial intelligence. How do we prepare kids for a future where a human-like AI is ubiquitous? We do that by giving them the tools and motivations to create and use their very own AI.
By building the hardware and teaching the voice assistant, kids learn how and why this technology works, rather than being tricked by ""black-box"" technology into thinking voice AI is human.


 
What is Chatterbox?
​1. Smart Speaker Kit
The only smart speaker kit easy enough for kids to build. The Chatterbox case is made of recyclable chipboard (really strong cardboard) and powered by the Raspberry Pi computer, the world's most popular educational computer. Its ears and voice are powered by our very own ChatterVoice HAT and microphone. Fold it, build it, customize it!

2. Smart Assistant
Chatterbox is the only educational assistant that kids can teach and program how to listen, talk and respond to commands. It's designed for learning and engineered for fun!

3. Chatterbox App
The Chatterbox app is a kid-friendly app that empowers kids to build their own voice-activated skills by connecting LEGO-like blocks. 
 
 
How Chatterbox Works
1. Build your own smart speaker
Our step-by-step instructions make it easy for any child seven or older to build the chipboard case and assemble the electronics, making problem solving fun and hands-on. It's as easy as making a paper airplane!  

 
2. Teachable smart assistant
Think of Chatterbox as a smart assistant that doesn't know it's smart yet. Teaching your assistant new tricks is simple using the easy-to-use Chatterbox Skill Builder. Kids as young as 7 years old can learn to build unique skills to get the weather, ask questions, control lights, listen to music and make their own voice-based games. Anything is possible!  

3. Montessori inspired, educator approved
Chatterbox is designed to give kids a practical learning environment where they can explore their unique creativity while developing communication, problem solving and critical thinking skills.   

 
What Kids Learn
 Chatterbox is a maker kit for children to build real, screen-free technology that they can use in their daily lives. Designing voice skills places greater emphasis on communication and creative thinking.   

1. Critical Thinking -- Learn to deconstruct problems to understand how things work.
2. Communication -- Build information processing skills by having to anticipate how other people communicate and ask questions. 
3. Problem Solving -- Solve problems using realtime information from the internet.
 
Kids are teaching their Chatterbox amazing skills!
Kids can set up magic words to control lights, play music, message grandparents and craft their own interactive story adventures. Anything is possible!

<p>SLA 3D printing gets more and more popular. However, the printers on the market are either too expensive or cheap but not user-friendly. So we made Paladin, the perfect combination of great quality and affordable price tag.</p>
<p>Paladin SLA 3D printer is designed with the industrial level 1080p LCD and light source so that it can print with high resolution consistently. With the all-metal body, auto leveling and dual Z-axis slides features, Paladin is easy to use and has better durability.</p>

Pressing the button to start the auto-refilling or resin recycling. There is a sensor which can judge the remaining condition of the resin to add it automatically. The pump can be cleaned by pouring anhydrous alcohol into the resin tank after the resin is recycled. In the case of the same kind of resin, the color can be mixed randomly.</p>

</div></div>","SLA 3D printing gets more and more popular. However, the printers on the market are either too expensive or cheap but not user-friendly. So we made Paladin, the perfect combination of great quality and affordable price tag.
Paladin SLA 3D printer is designed with the industrial level 1080p LCD and light source so that it can print with high resolution consistently. With the all-metal body, auto leveling and dual Z-axis slides features, Paladin is easy to use and has better durability.
 
XY Resolution: 50μm | Z Resolution: 10μm | Printing Size: 150*130*73mm
 
 

 
AUTO-LEVELING
Automatic leveling system makes the print preparing easier. Even if your print bed is somewhat unleveled, the auto-leveling 3D printer will make minor adjustments to make sure your print platform at an optimum place. 
 

 
Auto-leveling
 
AUTO RESIN PUMPING
Paladin has a built-in pump to pump refill in or drill out the resins from the tank, and it makes the resin management super easy and cost-effective. Pressing the button to start the auto-refilling or resin recycling. There is a sensor which can judge the remaining condition of the resin to add it automatically. The pump can be cleaned by pouring anhydrous alcohol into the resin tank after the resin is recycled. In the case of the same kind of resin, the color can be mixed randomly.
 
Auto Resin Pumping
 
AIR PURIFYING
Resins can smell bad and that`s the reason stopping many people to start SLA 3D printing. We bear that in mind when design Paladin! With the built-in air purifier, it can eliminate most of the awful smell and safe to use inside the house.
 
Build-in Air Purifying 2W Power Input
 

 
We used an all-metal design for Paladin`s body not only to make it durable and stable during the printing but also to make it a piece of art placing on your desktop.
 
All-metal Body
3D printing is time-consuming and we don`t want to miss the critical status. That`s why Paladin is one-button to get started and you can check the printing progress through the intuitive touchscreen.   
 
Intuitive Touchscreen
 

 
The key for a good printing result is the light source. We use a patented design and it can offer a more concentrated and improved light source for Paladin SLA 3D printer. 
 
Light gathering technology - Others vs Paladin
 
 The LCD screen is another core component.  Its normal thickness is 0.7mm but we used a special version of 1.3mm, and it has better heat resistance feature. By doing so, the screen will last 20 times longer (up to 3000 times print) than the normal ones.
 
Thicker LCD Screen for More Accurate Prints
 
Improved LCD Life With Better Heat-Resistant Materials
 


 

 
Step1: One Button to Connect The Resin & Auto-leveling
 
Step2: Drag The Printing File to The USB Drive
 
Step3: Insert The USB Drive to Paladin and Press The Start Button
 
Paladin Software
Paladin's software supports different layer thickness to help you get a balance between printing quality and printing time.

 

 
We also designed 3 great resins for you to get started with. They are good for multiple purpose usages, affordable too!
 
 Standard Resin | High-detail resin with smooth, injection mold-like surface 
 

 
 Flexible Resin | Simulating soft-touch materials and adding soft overmolds to multi-material assemblies

<p>Hi everyone, </p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read on…</p>
<p>My name is David Shepherd and I have previously
been employed very satisfyingly across a broad range of Corporate Support
Services Management within State Government as well as Sales Management and
Recruitment in the Private sector. </p>
<p>I am married, live in Tasmania and have a 27 and 21
year old daughter living in New South Wales and Queensland respectively.</p>
<p>Having firsthand experience of the shortcomings of
medical and health services available in rural and regional sectors as well as
looking for future directions I am now determined to complete a Bachelor Degree
in Medical Radiation Science that will enable me to work within Medical Imaging

<p>This will enable me to practice professionally, derive
permanent employment on graduation and also provide options for part-time, on
call and locum services to rural and regional locations in my later years.</p>
<p>I have been accepted into Charles Sturt University,
Wagga Wagga NSW campus (Student ID 68103148) and commence orientation on 23
February 2015 with studies commencing 2 March 2015.</p>
<p>Course fees are initially covered by the Australian
Government and are repayable from future earnings through the tax system. Relying
solely on Australian Government AUSTUDY living support of around $214 weekly
while studying will not cover the financial resources required to study
interstate at CSU Wagga Wagga including transport between my family home in
Tasmania and CSU Wagga Wagga (NSW) campus, accommodation, utilities, meals,
health, clothing, textbooks, computer and peripherals, telephone, internet,
travel and the list goes on!</p>
<p>There are extremely limited opportunities for
casual or partime employment within the Wagga Wagga area and I have
insufficient financial reserves to maintain myself so that is why I need your
help and support now.</p>
<p>Your generosity, support and encouragement will
open a new chapter in my life, guarantee my future economic independence and
allow me to give back to communities.</p>
<p><b><u>What We Need &amp; What You Get</u></b></p>
<p>I estimate that additional actual costs for first
year studies are somewhere around $9000 in real terms over and above existing commitments
especially given that two households need to be sustained for at least part of
the first year.  Once the households are amalgamated into the Wagga Wagga
area that will substantially reduce costs and allow excess funding to be rolled
forward into future years. Don't be afraid to ""overgive""!</p>

<p> I have lived in small rural and regional
communities for some time and have firsthand experience of the pain and trauma
suffered when the closest hospital maybe an hour’s drive away, can’t complete
simple X-rays for a broken arm/shoulder because they can’t maintain 24 hours
services and may limited On Call or Locum capability. You then may have to stay
in hospital overnight and then be driven another hour or more to have X-rays
done! So maybe 24 hours later you get your arm set!</p>
<p>I love living in a rural setting although it comes
with the price of limited levels of medical support availability -
too few practitioners over an extended geographic area and what seems to be
continuing budget reductions.</p>
<p>I have recently spoken with radiographers and
sonographers and explained that I want to study, gain real life experience and
then focus on providing on call services to rural hospitals that can’t sustain
full time Radiography staff as well as rural and regional Locum support.

notice – only missing out on my HSC by 3 marks in English! The following year I
returned to college full time and undertook a combined Year 11/12 in one year
and Matriculated with results above 85% of my former school colleagues.</p>

1800’s/early 1900’s stated he would rather have 100 agents sell 1 cash register
each rather than 1 agent who could sell 100!!

Our students are participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition for the first time in their academic career. The competition involves lifting, transporting and maneuvering recycling totes throughout the field of play and gain the most number of points they can in 2.5 minutes. They will compete in teams of three schools, all collaborating to achieve the task of clearing the field of play of litter.</p>
<p>Each of our eight students wants to pursue a career in STEM, and this competition allows them to nurture the many skills needed in those fields. Their talents range from computer programming, mechanical engineering, electronics, metalwork and structural design. Throughout the daily meetings--which last four to five hours on the weekdays, and up to 12 hours a day on the weekends--the students have learned valuable technical skills as well as interpersonal skills of teamwork and conflict resolution.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help us fund the materials needed to finish the construction of our robot. The registration of $6000 was raised by the students and an additional $1500 has been spent on supplies by the students. These out-of-pocket  expenses limit the boundaries of our design. The greater amount of funding we receive, the greater amount of creative freedom is available to our students. </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We will need funding for the following:</p>
<p>- Materials (aluminum angles, circuitry, motors, gears, pulleys, chains)</p>
<p>- Travel expenses to the competition</p>
<p>- Lodging expenses in Peoria, IL</p>
<p>- Additional funding will go towards further establishing a robotics curriculum at our school, including an inventory of robotics equipment, mechanical tools, and supplies for STEM education.</p>
<p>For your support, we will provide you:</p>
<p>- Updates on the progress of our robotics competition entry</p>
<p>- Personalized letters showing the effect of this competition experience on our student's academic and future professional careers</p>
<p>- Sponsorship recognition on the competition robot to be displayed at the event</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>As a small school, we are limited in the number of programs we can provide to our students. Our students have very sharp engineering minds but do not have the resources to apply them to real-life applications. This competition allows them to experience firsthand the excitement and challenges that the process of engineering  offers.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Our main challenge is to create a robot that can participate in the 2015 FIRST Robotics Competition and compete with other schools to gain a spot for the National Robotics Championship. The interdisciplinary knowledge of electronics, mechanical engineering, and structural design must be applied seamlessly to achieve the requirements of lifting, transporting and maneuvering through the competition field of play. The risk of funding this campaign is that our students are competing for the first time in such a competition.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Helping Hands at Hemp Nation</b></p>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hemp Nation’s purpose as a Research and Cultivation School is to develop and promote personal independence by using raw hemp materials, processing tools, and business techniques to grow, harvest, create, make available, and allow for the sale of excess hemp retail products.</p>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We provide education by offering lectures, classes, labs, and other hands-on experiences focused around the propagation, harvesting, and processing of industrial hemp as well as its useful, manufacturable end-products; i.e. cloth, paper, bio-diesel, various construction materials, and food stock. Hemp Nation also strives to provide all the tools and materials needed to grow, process, and package hemp products including land, seeds, fertilizer and planting tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The participants work the fields, grow houses, or labs, manning all the equipment while learning hands on in a live environment. A portion of whole goods is kept by Hemp Nation for other projects while the rest is evenly distributed among the participants for the last and most creative lab in a coursework track - “The Finishing Lab.” All who enter The Finishing Lab are considered artists - no longer participants - and are taught and encouraged to take care in their creative process as they turn their hemp whole goods into ready-to-use or ready-to-sell conditioned merchandise, also known as retail goods.</p>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hemp Nation acknowledges that everything made in these Finishing Labs, belongs to the artist, to keep or to sell. Artists are encouraged to only keep what they need and prepare the rest to sell in the retail market, hence, the artists have become their own bosses. Also, these artists can now effectively reproduce every aspect of their product, having obtained knowledge and skills they can employ at will for their own independence.</p>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is where Hemp Nation brings in the storefront and restaurant, “Wake &amp; Bake” in Alamosa, CO. Just like Hemp Nation, Wake &amp; Bake is also run by volunteers and will serve a full breakfast menu 24 hours a day while providing a retail venue for hemp goods. Artist’s from Hemp Nation may also choose to sell their handcrafted hemp goods at Wake &amp; Bake. Proceeds from sales are then split equally between Hemp Nation which puts 100% of its funds back into the next generation of programs, and the artist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opportunities at Hemp Nation take three forms:</p>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">a.) Full-Time Volunteers:  Those who have chosen to devote at 32 - 60 hours a week toward the development, success, and daily operation of Hemp Nation. Full-time volunteers receive free meals, limited assistance with housing (based on current availability) and other essential needs as set forth and approved by the board of directors. These dedicated volunteers run the day-to-day operations of Hemp Nation, receiving no direct compensation, but are granted full access to all services and benefits of the Hemp Nation facilities during their personal time for the length of time they are active Volunteers for Hemp Nation. </p>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">b.) Part-Time Volunteers: Those who donate less than 32 hours per week. Part-time volunteers eat with full-time volunteers and are only granted access to all of the services and benefits of the Hemp Nation facilities as agreed upon. </p>

Members work under the direction of a designated instructor, following all rules and regulations of the lecture or lab. Members also receive 10% off in store retail and dining purchases, 50% off local produce and free domestic shipping of our retail products. Members also receive invitations to attend special events</p>
<p>
</p><p>d.) Students: Those who pay a fee for a specific lecture or lab and only have access to the related services and materials for the duration of the event. </p>

Schools don't need more policy. They don't need more standards or more tests. Teachers need quick fixes to the problems that plague them daily. Hack Learning books provide <b>amazing, quick fixes that schools can implement immediately</b>, with no-nonsense strategies from expert Hackers. The first two books are currently in production, but <b>we need your help to put them in teachers' hands. </b></p>
<h2><b>Something new</b></h2>
<p>Don't miss our update in the ""About HLS"" section below: We've got an<b> amazing new HLS product!</b></p>
<h3>The <b>Hack Learning story from author</b> Mark Barnes</h3>
<p>For more than a decade, I failed my students. I tried to teach 12-year-olds from a dusty old box filled with worksheets, lectures and coffee-stained bubble tests. The kids hated my class and, worse, many hated learning. Just when I thought about giving up on teaching, an amazing thing happened. I read one powerful book about what motivates people, and I knew that my philosophy of teaching and learning was archaic and wrong. This epiphany helped me realize that <b>learning should be engaging and fun</b>; that even big problems can be solved with surprisingly simple ideas. To see these ideas, our learning needs to be <i>hacked</i>.</p>

<p><i>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What helped me solve my problem was someone else's experience and objectivity, coupled with a hacker's mentality.

Hack Learning books provide real answers from <b>amazing Hackers--the best in the business.</b></p>
<h3>Support our Hackers</h3>
<p>Hack Learning Series authors are internationally recognized experts, who provide practical advice from experience. Mark Barnes' first book, <i>Role Reversa</i>l, was named a Best Professional Book by Teacher Librarian Magazine. Mark's <i>Assessment 3.0 </i>sold out on Amazon, during the pre-sale period. Mark's <i><a href=""http://brilliant-insane.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brilliant or Insane</a></i> blog attracts hundreds of thousands of readers monthly  <b><i>Hacking Education</i> co-author and our lead consultant Jennifer Gonzalez </b>publishes Cult of Pedagogy, one of education's most popular resources. Jennifer's article ""Nothing Says Over 40 Like Two Spaces after a Period"" has been read by more than 400,000 people. Mark Barnes, Jennifer Gonzalez and other HLS authors bring the Hacker mentality (experience and vision) to books that are easy-to-read blueprints for change. Our mantra is: <b>Read today, implement change tomorrow</b>. </p>
<h3>What schools need and Hack Learning books give</h3> <ul> <li>
<b>A guiding theme</b>: Education, Assessment, Common Core, Digital Literacy, Leadership, Poverty, Special Education, and many more</li>

</div></div>","Hacking Education and More with Simple Ideas The Hack Learning Series is what our schools and our teachers have needed for decades. Schools don't need more policy. They don't need more standards or more tests. Teachers need quick fixes to the problems that plague them daily. Hack Learning books provide amazing, quick fixes that schools can implement immediately, with no-nonsense strategies from expert Hackers. The first two books are currently in production, but we need your help to put them in teachers' hands. 
Something new
Don't miss our update in the ""About HLS"" section below: We've got an amazing new HLS product!
The Hack Learning story from author Mark Barnes
For more than a decade, I failed my students. I tried to teach 12-year-olds from a dusty old box filled with worksheets, lectures and coffee-stained bubble tests. The kids hated my class and, worse, many hated learning. Just when I thought about giving up on teaching, an amazing thing happened. I read one powerful book about what motivates people, and I knew that my philosophy of teaching and learning was archaic and wrong. This epiphany helped me realize that learning should be engaging and fun; that even big problems can be solved with surprisingly simple ideas. To see these ideas, our learning needs to be hacked.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Become an Executive Partner--Our Top Perk


Remember, our soon-to-be-launched Hack Learning App will have tens of thousands of users. We'll feature our Executive Partners there, too!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------What helped me solve my problem was someone else's experience and objectivity, coupled with a hacker's mentality. During the last decade, I've worked with professionals who understand the hacker's mentality: They see solutions most people do not see. I've spent years honing their approach, and I've recruited some of the best hackers in the world to help me build the Hack Learning Series--books that solve big problems with simple ideas right now--no 5-year plan needed. 
   About the Hack Learning Series The Hack Learning Series is an ongoing, independent project. Initial production includes four professionally published books with both ebook and beautifully produced paperback versions. 
Updated March 23
We are also developing a Hack Learning Series app, which will put all of our content in the palm of your hands on iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows Phone, Kindle Fire and Nook,  All books in the first wave will be published in the next 16 months, and our app will be available in April. Campaign contributors will receive a variety of perks, including supporter recognition, eBooks, hard copy books and, get this, books for life at the Partner level. More important, you'll be part of what promises to be education's game-changing series.

The Impact
 Most education books are packed with research, statistics, abbreviations, philosophy, 5-year plans, and some contain empty promises from people who either have never taught or haven't been in a classroom in decades. Hack Learning books provide real answers from amazing Hackers--the best in the business.
Support our Hackers
Hack Learning Series authors are internationally recognized experts, who provide practical advice from experience. Mark Barnes' first book, Role Reversal, was named a Best Professional Book by Teacher Librarian Magazine. Mark's Assessment 3.0 sold out on Amazon, during the pre-sale period. Mark's Brilliant or Insane blog attracts hundreds of thousands of readers monthly  Hacking Education co-author and our lead consultant Jennifer Gonzalez publishes Cult of Pedagogy, one of education's most popular resources. Jennifer's article ""Nothing Says Over 40 Like Two Spaces after a Period"" has been read by more than 400,000 people. Mark Barnes, Jennifer Gonzalez and other HLS authors bring the Hacker mentality (experience and vision) to books that are easy-to-read blueprints for change. Our mantra is: Read today, implement change tomorrow. 
What schools need and Hack Learning books give  
A guiding theme: Education, Assessment, Common Core, Digital Literacy, Leadership, Poverty, Special Education, and many more

10 Hacks: simple solutions to the problem from leading experts in the field

Blueprint for change: step-by-step guidelines for easy, immediate implementation of every hack

Our challenge

Rather than selling the Hack Learning Series to a publisher, we decided to remain independent and maintain complete control over all parts of the project. Our mission is to produce the best problem-solving books that education stakeholders have ever seen, in a short time, with a small team of the very best Hackers in the world. However, we believe our independence is our strength. The Hack Learning Series is our baby--and yours. It will have our undivided attention and unconditional love, and our readers will benefit from books that arrive quickly and come with a reasonable price.

ranking in the <a href=""http://www.shell.com/global/environment-society/ecomarathon/events/europe.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Shell eco-marathon Europe""</a>  races every year. Last year's performance

noteworthy that teams from industrial European countries with large budgets
were ranked lower than our team’s vehicle. </p>
<p>Another important success was attained by ""Prometheus"" in 2013. Our team received the ""Best team spirit award"" among 200 competitors. The award pertained to the team's promotion of Greek culture, the vigorous team work, spirit and enthusiasm. In addition, after hard training on safety methods and applying a rollover protection system at ""Pyrforos II"", we were received 2nd place for the ""Off-track Safety award 2015"".<br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>Our short-term goal is the implementation of our newly developed propulsion system technologies in ""Pyrforos II"" and their demonstration at the
""Shell Eco-marathon"" race in London next summer. Elevation and sharp
turns make the new track a new challenge for all teams. We should now possess not only efficient vehicles but strategic driving plans. Due to those reasons, we are planning to construct a new electric motor and a power inverter specifically optimized for the track conditions and different driving strategies. <br/></p>

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">As far as the electric motor is concerned, we want to proceed with the assembly and
testing of a tiny, high-speed, high-efficiency electric motor coupled with

The control strategy being used is a robust field oriented control via space vector modulation. Cutting-edge discrete mosfets will replace the old all-in-one module and increase further the efficiency. The inverter circuit will also enable us to view what 's happening inside the motor in real time by sending signals wirelessly to our laptops.

<h3><b>What are our mid-term plans?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The next big step for ""Prometheus
team"", a dream yet to come true is constructing ""Pyrforos
U"". An Urban, electric vehicle with amazingly low running costs. Taking
advantage of the team’s know-how in designing efficient vehicles, we can now
step up and construct a vehicle to compete in the “Urban-Concept” category of
“Shell Eco Marathon” and get a big step closer into being able to mass produce
a cheap, environmentally friendly vehicle that anybody could drive in a city
environment. A true vehicle that would be greek from top to bottom. The design
and the specifications of ""Pyrforos U"" are depicted below. The appropriate
funding is now required. </p>

</div></div>","We are a Greek research group of electrical engineers envisioning a green planet. With raw materials and passion we change the way you move. With our hand-made, eco-friendly, prototype, electric vehicle constructed from scratch, your 1.000 km trip will now cost less than 20 cents of a euro. It's time for you to become part of this effort. 



What is “Prometheus”?
“Prometheus” is a non-profit research team of the National Technical University of Athens - Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. Prometheus members design and construct high efficiency electric vehicles. All students are undergraduates and PhD candidates of the specific department.

Why “Prometheus”?
Prometheus
was the Greek mythical titan who gave mankind fire after stealing it from the gods. Fire changed mankind dramatically. Our vehicle is named ""Pyrforos"" which means “he who brings fire"". Our team is named after the titan “Prometheus” being the symbol of our University. 

Now it’s our time to bring a new type of “fire” as he did thousands of years ago. Αn ultra-efficient green way to move.



What do we do?
Our team continuously upgrades all of the vehicle’s components by re-designing and re-constructing them.  Prometheus is one of the few teams in this competition which possesses a significant know-how in the entire range of electric vehicle development.
What have we constructed so
far?
""Pyrforos II"" is our team's
newest accomplishment and the successor of ""Pyrforos"". Seven years of challenging improvement enhanced our experience and know-how in the electric vehicles design and construction. As a result, driving ""Pyrforos II"" is actually cheaper than using your laptop computer! ""Pyrforos II"" technical features: 


Kerb Weight:                                 39kg Nominal Race Consumption:  60W Race speed:                                   27 km/h Top speed:                                     50 km/hRange:                                             60 km Battery Recharging Time:        30 minutesCruise Control:                             ECO Adaptive   







What have we accomplished so far?


Our team is steadily improving its
ranking in the ""Shell eco-marathon Europe""  races every year. Last year's performance
achieved 10th position among 50 participants in the most
competitive category of the race.  It's
noteworthy that teams from industrial European countries with large budgets
were ranked lower than our team’s vehicle. 
Another important success was attained by ""Prometheus"" in 2013. Our team received the ""Best team spirit award"" among 200 competitors. The award pertained to the team's promotion of Greek culture, the vigorous team work, spirit and enthusiasm. In addition, after hard training on safety methods and applying a rollover protection system at ""Pyrforos II"", we were received 2nd place for the ""Off-track Safety award 2015"".



Due to the fact that we have minimal financial resources, we had to achieve our goals through other routes: Those of innovative, inexpensive, yet effective means. 
What is the main goal?


Our short-term goal is the implementation of our newly developed propulsion system technologies in ""Pyrforos II"" and their demonstration at the
""Shell Eco-marathon"" race in London next summer. Elevation and sharp
turns make the new track a new challenge for all teams. We should now possess not only efficient vehicles but strategic driving plans. Due to those reasons, we are planning to construct a new electric motor and a power inverter specifically optimized for the track conditions and different driving strategies. 



As far as the electric motor is concerned, we want to proceed with the assembly and
testing of a tiny, high-speed, high-efficiency electric motor coupled with
a reduction gear, to power the rear-wheel of the vehicle. The new motor is
expected to have equivalent efficiency with the old one, but in a remarkably
higher speed range of the vehicle. Thus achieving improved efficiency in sloping roads and therefore enhanced economy.

Besides the new motor, we are already designing a highly efficient controller that converts the direct current from the battery to smooth three phase ac current that excites the machine stator . The control strategy being used is a robust field oriented control via space vector modulation. Cutting-edge discrete mosfets will replace the old all-in-one module and increase further the efficiency. The inverter circuit will also enable us to view what 's happening inside the motor in real time by sending signals wirelessly to our laptops. An autopilot program that will follow an energy optimal policy is also under development. 





What are our mid-term plans?



The next big step for ""Prometheus
team"", a dream yet to come true is constructing ""Pyrforos
U"". An Urban, electric vehicle with amazingly low running costs. Taking
advantage of the team’s know-how in designing efficient vehicles, we can now
step up and construct a vehicle to compete in the “Urban-Concept” category of
“Shell Eco Marathon” and get a big step closer into being able to mass produce
a cheap, environmentally friendly vehicle that anybody could drive in a city
environment. A true vehicle that would be greek from top to bottom. The design
and the specifications of ""Pyrforos U"" are depicted below. The appropriate
funding is now required.

It is noteworthy that most of the initial team members as well as their successors are now working in the R&D departments of the greatest automotive industries, developing the electric vehicles of the future. 

Why do we need your support?
""Prometheus"" is neither funded by the University nor by the Greek State. All previous funds and sponsorships have been granted by Greek businesses and the private sector. Although funding has always been uncertain and unpredictable, we have always managed to collect the necessary financial support. In the past two years, however, support has been scarce due to the economic crisis and deep recession in our country. Therefore, most Greek business sponsorships go to charity organizations, placing technological and scientific research initiatives in a lower priority. 



Taking into consideration the growing interest of people who believe in the necessity of a greener world, we came up with the idea of crowdfunding. Our initial, main goal is to achieve fundraising covering the pink section of the chart. Should we manage to reach this goal, we will continue our efforts to accumulate the financial support necessary for the construction of ""Pyrforos U"".

Who receives the money?
Contributions are deposited into the Institute of Communications and Computer Systems (ICCS) account which manages the finance of all the research programs of our University with tranparency. This means that every expense incurred for equipment, expendables etc. is verified by the Institute for its necessity, usefulness and validity..",15.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<div>
<p>Hi, my name is Montserrat Cuellar Mestas. I’m an 18 year old Mexican girl learning the craft of acting, singing and dancing. I lived in the UK when I was little, I studied primary school there and that’s when I fell in love with the theatre and performing. I moved back to Mexico and I lived in Colima where I did high school. This fall 2014 I was admitted into the BFA Musical Theatre program at Santa Fe University of Art and Design in Santa Fe, New Mexico USA. I was awarded a partial scholarship for Performing Arts achievements. I’m currently doing my second semester at this college.</p>I need more financial resources to cover my tuition and housing, so I launched this campaign to be able to continue my education in order to pursue my dreams.<br/>
</div>
<div>With the support of the people who can collaborate for my campaign, not only will I be able to continue studying and graduate from College, but I will become an artist that returns to her community and shares her knowledge and experiences, but above all I will be an example of tenacity and success.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What I need and what you get</h3>
<div></div>

En soi, même le processus de sélection m'a permis de me dépasser et repousser mes limites, en lesquelles bien des fois je dois admettre avoir douté; alors, imaginez ce que des études dans cette université peuvent m'apporter! Cette maîtrise d'une durée d'un an m'offrira un monde de possibilités en terme de carrières. La qualité de l'éducation et la réputation de l'université me donneront également la chance de développer des compétences qui me permettront de me démarquer sur le marché du travail en vue de faire partie de l'élite dans mon domaine. 


Risques et défis



Il est important de mentionner que trouver cet énorme montant d'argent en à peine un mois s'avérera certainement difficile, mais maintenant que j'ai la confirmation qu'avec de la persévérance il n'y a rien de trop beau, je crois que je peux y arriver avec votre aide.


Conclusion

Si vous n'êtes pas en mesure de m'aider financièrement, sachez que vous pouvez faire toute la différence en partageant cette campagne auprès de votre entourage.


Enfin, le simple fait que vous soyez ici à lire mes mots me touche énormément. À tous, un grand MERCI!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><br/></p><p>COUNCIL OAK MONTESSORI SCHOOL BACKGROUND</p>
<p>This non-profit school was started 25 years ago based on the
teachings of Maria Montessori’s philosophy and has endeavored to offer a
classic and authentic Montessori program for children ages 3 to 15. </p>
<p>According to Montessori “A child’s work is to create the person
he/she will become.” In order to accomplish the task of self-construction,
children need freedom to engage in purposeful movement, exploration, and
discovery of the physical and social world, and a program which is geared to
their natural stages of development and sensitive periods for learning. </p>
<p>A Montessori classroom provides the kind of freedom the child
needs within a structured environment, to develop a sense of order and purpose.
The essence of the Montessori teacher’s job is to direct the child to those
materials and activities he or she needs to learn. The teacher’s method and the
organization of the environment ultimately aids the child in developing two
most important characteristics: self-motivation and self-discipline. </p>
<p>For more information go to: <a href=""http://counciloakmontessori.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://counciloakmontessori.org/</a></p>
<p><br/></p><p>OUR GOALS FOR THE AUCTION</p>
<p>We are hoping to raise $20,000 of profit for the student
scholarship fund in order to ease the financial burden of private schooling.
The average tuition cost for a student at Council Oak Montessori School is
$7,300. Every year Council Oak Montessori School <b>gives out around $20,000 in scholarships</b> while receiving $0 of
government funding! Since it is an accredited 501c3 non-profit school all money
raised goes directly to supporting the students. This means that your
participation will allow the school to give out more scholarships than we were
able to before. </p>
<p><br/></p><p>THE IMPACT</p>
<p>For many families, private education is a struggle. But it is an
exceptionally<em>valuable</em>struggle carried on in the best
interest of those families’ most precious possessions, their own children. The
struggle makes sense because the first ten to fifteen years of education (from
pre-school through eighth grade) are the period in life in which every penny
invested in a child’s education has its greatest effect. Study after study show
the irreplaceable impact of early life experiences in later academic success and
happiness. </p>
<p>A Montessori education is an extraordinarily valuable investment
for any parent. The return on this investment is a happy, capable child
equipped with unique skills which are critical for genuine success in a global
society. This is the kind of young person that secondary schools and
universities search for. Not only do graduates of Montessori schools have a
solid starting point in education, but they also are confident people who leave
the school with a deep rooted self-confidence.</p>
<p>Last year the Art Auction was able to support four students
with scholarships from the $16,000 profit that was made from the event. Every
small contribution that you could make matters. </p>
<p><br/></p><p>RISKS &amp; OBSTACLES </p>
<p>Our biggest hurdle for the event is to get the word out and get
people to the auction. With limited funding for advertisements, we rely most on
word-of-mouth from our parents and connections that we have via Facebook. In
order to overcome this hurdle, we have brought on an event planner who has worked

<p>This is a unique opportunity for you to make a short-term contribution that will provide an exponential return in the future and help sustain and enrich our most vital assets.  Importantly, when properly nurtured, this asset has the power to literally change the world.  The asset that I’m referring to is our children. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of our traditional institutions are failing to provide the necessary foundation and requisite life lessons for adulthood.  Rather than passively accepting the status quo, I chose to take direct action and work towards a solution using one of the most powerful teaching methods that exists today.  The method that I’m referring to is Brazilian Jiu-jitsu.  Through my academy, videos and Texas Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation, I’ve witnessed a positive transformation in my young students as they embrace the “gentle art” of Jiu-jitsu and the life-lessons that this martial art imparts.  The results and success stories that I’ve witnessed have far exceeded all of my expectations. </p>
<p>It’s now time with to take the successes to an even larger stage and I need your help!</p>
<p>My goal is to improve cooperation state-wide and promote the image of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, as not only a safe and effective sport, but a vehicle and foundation for children to lead successful lives.</p>
<p>In support of this goal, we are going to promote a series of “one-of-a-kind” jiu-jitsu tournaments in the state of Texas, which will be unlike any other tournament in the world!  And yes, there is an essential tie-in to children.</p>
<p>We need your help to purchase new mats and other complementary equipment to help set the plan in motion.</p>
<p>I cannot think of a more positive environment for a child to experience  than a BJJ studio. Most parents turn to martial arts to teach their kids discipline. Discipline is only one of the positive aspect of martial arts. </p>
<p>BJJ attracts people of different ages, backgrounds, and professions. But despite the diversity, every single one is there for one reason: to get better at BJJ. In today’s society the workforce is more diverse than ever. It is important for kids to see people of different ages, races, and educational backgrounds working together.</p>
<p>In every BJJ gym you will see students who are older receiving instruction from younger students. There are men teaching classes to women and women teaching classes to men.Unlike the corporate culture of some companies, in BJJ differences are not an issue. Children learn the importance of taking instruction and feedback from different people.</p>
<p>My name is Joao Crus and I am the head of The Texas Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation. The Texas Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation is an affiliation of Jiu-Jitsu schools across Texas promoting sportsmanship and cooperation in the sport of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Its mission is to improve cooperation state-wide and promote the image of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as a safe and effective sport. We hope you will join us in this goal.</p>
<p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is the fastest growing martial art in the world.  Given the rapid growth, we want to ensure  and promote fair and affordable tournaments in the state of Texas.</p>
<p>We need your help to purchase new mats and other complementary equipment.</p>

Unfortunately, many of our traditional institutions are failing to provide the necessary foundation and requisite life lessons for adulthood.  Rather than passively accepting the status quo, I chose to take direct action and work towards a solution using one of the most powerful teaching methods that exists today.  The method that I’m referring to is Brazilian Jiu-jitsu.  Through my academy, videos and Texas Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation, I’ve witnessed a positive transformation in my young students as they embrace the “gentle art” of Jiu-jitsu and the life-lessons that this martial art imparts.  The results and success stories that I’ve witnessed have far exceeded all of my expectations. 
It’s now time with to take the successes to an even larger stage and I need your help!
My goal is to improve cooperation state-wide and promote the image of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, as not only a safe and effective sport, but a vehicle and foundation for children to lead successful lives.
In support of this goal, we are going to promote a series of “one-of-a-kind” jiu-jitsu tournaments in the state of Texas, which will be unlike any other tournament in the world!  And yes, there is an essential tie-in to children.
We need your help to purchase new mats and other complementary equipment to help set the plan in motion.
I cannot think of a more positive environment for a child to experience  than a BJJ studio. Most parents turn to martial arts to teach their kids discipline. Discipline is only one of the positive aspect of martial arts. 
BJJ attracts people of different ages, backgrounds, and professions. But despite the diversity, every single one is there for one reason: to get better at BJJ. In today’s society the workforce is more diverse than ever. It is important for kids to see people of different ages, races, and educational backgrounds working together.
In every BJJ gym you will see students who are older receiving instruction from younger students. There are men teaching classes to women and women teaching classes to men.Unlike the corporate culture of some companies, in BJJ differences are not an issue. Children learn the importance of taking instruction and feedback from different people.
My name is Joao Crus and I am the head of The Texas Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation. The Texas Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation is an affiliation of Jiu-Jitsu schools across Texas promoting sportsmanship and cooperation in the sport of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Its mission is to improve cooperation state-wide and promote the image of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as a safe and effective sport. We hope you will join us in this goal.
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is the fastest growing martial art in the world.  Given the rapid growth, we want to ensure  and promote fair and affordable tournaments in the state of Texas.
We need your help to purchase new mats and other complementary equipment.

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<div>Q:Was wondering if an Android app will be released for this product? Please let me know. Thanks!<br/>
</div>
<div>A:It can not only fit for iOS ,but also for Android.</div>
<div>Q:I wanted to know if I ship it 
to a Canadian address with the Early bird if shipping is included? Please let me 
know. Thanks!<br/>
</div>
<div>A:Yes,of course.</div>
<p>Q:Doe this unit measure weight?</p>
<div>A:Yes. It is very actuate. It measures weight, BMI and water weight also. Weight yourself 1st thing in the morning before you eat or drink anything for best results. Just enter your age, height, female/male etc. Very easy to use and to store info automatically.<br/>
</div>
<div>Q:Why does it need to know your age?Does it use it for other caculations?<br/>
</div>
<div>A:The explanation is that the percentages are figured by the use of two formulas, one of which is an algorithm that is universally recognized and used by the FDA as well. It used input such as age, height, weight, gender, activity, etc., to calculate what your percentage of body fat is and when used along with the much simpler formula that is based only on weight to height ratios it can make the numbers much more accurate. The most accurate numbers come from the water displacement tanks used by pro sports and bigger health facilities, but these scales we buy at such reasonable prices cannot get that accurate. So, by using these 2 formulas in harmony with the electrical signal impedance (which I am sure measures differently, on average, depending on your age), these scales can get as close as possible for us. I hope this additional information to my original answer helps you somewhat to understand why it asks for age.<br/>

Who We Are

Inspired by Consumer Reports, MingJian is an NGO started on World Consumer Rights Day (March 15, 2010) by an American and Chinese husband and wife (James Feldkamp and Jessie Qiu) living in Shanghai. Our purpose is to provide an independent expert reference to safe, quality products and empower consumers in China. 

Our Contribution and Commitment
Together with ICRT member consumer organizations and motor clubs in 22 countries, MingJian has been testing child safety seats since 2012, testing nearly 150 models to-date. In addition to international models, we recently subjected 100 samples of Chinese models to the same comprehensive safety tests in Europe. Although test results are usually only available to paid subscribers, as part of this campaign we will make all child safety seat test results available FREE to all consumers in China accessible on our website at www. mingjian.cn .
Additionally, we commit ourselves to applying our experience in child safety, child restraint testing and expertise in child restraint installation inspection (James Feldkamp is certified by TRL Child Safety Centre and Good Egg Safety in the UK for child safety seat fitting) to the cause of Child Road Safety in China and saving kids lives. 

Campaign Goals

In order to ensure that children are safety secured in child restraints, the following three objectives need to be met:
1) INTENT TO USE: Educate parents in China about the benefits of child safety seats and consequences of non-use.
2) SAFE MODEL SELECTION: Help parents select safe, reliable child restraints suited for their child and vehicle.
3) PROPER INSTALLATION: Provide training on proper child restraint installation

Why We Need Your Help
We are passionate about child safety in China and want to share with parents across China information that can keep their kids safe on the road. With your support we can reach thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands or even millions of parents and save kids lives. 
With your donations we will:
1) Host consumer events to promote child safety seat use with:
a) Video presentation of the benefits of child safety seats and consequences of non-use, highlights from crash test footage


b) Interactive sled demonstration. 80% of parents in China believe that infants are safer held in the arms of an adult than secured in a child safety seat. We will hire a demonstration sled where parents can experience trying to hold an infant in a simulated crash.
c) Online access to child safety seat test results, video guides, and tutorials accessible for attendees throughout the event and during the campaign.
d) Free inspections of child safety seat installations. A NHTSA study concluded that 3 on every 4 child safety seats are improperly installed. We will offer free vehicle inspections of child safety seat installation as well as installation training with different vehicles and types of child safety seats.

2) Media event just before June 1 International Children's Day we will release the latest test results of 32 models of child safety seats and make test results of all child safety seat models freely available to all consumers in China.
3) Create a series of video shorts (similar to the video clip at the top of this campaign used effectively in Europe) to vividly show the importance of child safety seat use and consequences of non-use. Additional videos will made to demonstrate properly installation of different types of child safety seats and tips to ensure your child is properly secured. In addition to an online video campaign, we hope to broadcast these videos in taxis and on TV public service announcements.
4) Create pamphlets explaining the importance of child safety seats, how to select a safe model, and how to install properly with QR code links to the free child safety seat reviews, buying guides, as well as installation videos. The pamphlets will be distributed to parents in community centers, maternity and children hospitals, nursery and primary schools, and handed out in gas stations.
5) Social media campaign encouraging consumers to share the videos with friends and spread the word about the importance of child safety seats.

<p>Raising the innovators and leaders of the future means helping kids love to learn and giving them lots of ways to invent and explore -- fail and challenge themselves -- and discover the world around them. We want them to read voraciously, learn math so that it comes naturally, and pursue science and history not only to understand how things work but to invent and discover things on their own!</p>
<p>As educators and parents we buy workbooks and scour the Internet (and Pinterest) for enrichment ideas. But so often, ideas that look great on the web don't work, we can't tell if our students understand the latest hot new novel, and who has 100 Popsicle sticks or 3-volt LED lights hanging around the house?</p>
<p>Boost in a Box delivers academic enrichment right to your door. We test all of the boxes at our learning center to make sure they provide maximum learning, challenge, and joy! Every necessary component (we strive to use household materials, but seriously, what normal household contains all of these things?) comes in the box. Every book has been vetted by our students, hand-picked for your child, and comes with materials that not only make it more interesting, but easy for you to check for understanding. Every math activity not only provides practice, but a little bit of fun. And, our Daily Boost injects a tiny (not more than a minute or two) academic boost into your everyday lives EVERY DAY.</p>
<p>This is fun, hands-on, rigorous academic enrichment -- and it involves no scrambling, stress, or pleading from parents. Kids want to do these projects as soon as they see them. (And parents, we want to challenge the kids, but we give you cheat sheets and videos in case you get stuck!)<br/></p>
<p>Boost in a Box would be an amazing boost for your K-6* child. Supplement school, add education to summer, feed nascent interests, and expand your kids' horizons. </p>
<p>Boost in a Box would be an incredible gift for any child you love.  Wouldn't your grandkids, nieces or nephews, or family friends LOVE getting a box of hands-on activities in the mail every month (and wouldn't their parents be grateful that it's not another toy?). It's the gift that keeps on giving!</p>
<p>Boost in a Box is a gift to any child, but it is an especially phenomenal gift for low-income children in under-resourced communities, many of whom have very little access to learning that's fun. As with everything that EdBoost does, Boost in a Box profits will go to serving low-income students. Moreover, for EVERY Boost in a Box you purchase, we'll donate a hands-on activity to a low-income child. You can also donate a complete Boost in a Box, or a summer's worth of Boosts in Boxes, to a low-income child.  (And, EdBoost is a 501(c)(3) so donations are tax-deductible!  We'll send you a receipt!) Research shows that every summer low-income kids, who have kept up during the school year, fall behind their more advantaged peers.  Delivering a Boost in a Box to those students can add joy to their summer and help them keep up academically.</p>
<p>Please help us as we build Boost in a Box, which we will hope will enrich and develop our future leaders, innovators, and world-changers. Buy something for your kids, do some good. Donate, do some good. No matter what you do, you'll  be making the world a smarter place. And, as we say at EdBoost: smarter kids, better world. </p>
<p>*For now, Boost in a Box is for kids in grades K-6.  Once you sign up, we'll send you a questionnaire so we can tailor boxes to the child who will be receiving the boxes.</p>

<p><b>Math activities</b> are chosen for students based upon their answers to questions on their online survey (and performance on any other online quizzes on our website).  Activities include practice packets (and answer keys), and a hands-on math challenge or a math game that encourages practice and mastery (each game has several versions, some that are easy, others that are more challenging, some to play against others, as well as some to play against yourself or a timer).</p>
<p><b>Hands-on Science and History/Culture activities</b> include a set of instruction/observation cards that guides students through several investigations, experiments, and challenges, all of the materials needed for all activities, space to record observations and write up results (like a lab notebook), and ideas for future exploration.

<p>Your first Boost in a Box includes a magnetic <b>Daily Boost</b> holder and a month of Daily Boost cards.  Each subsequent box includes a new month of Daily Boost cards.

No more parents feeling guilty (either because they didn't buy any workbooks or for making their kids DO the workbooks they did buy!). Kids <u><b>want</b></u> to learn and explore with Boost in a Box. Boost in the Box parents will know that their kids are challenging themselves and exploring areas and ideas they've never worked with before.</p>
<p>And, because every Boost in a Box activity comes with background information (for students and parents!), students work through a lot of the materials independently. If they get stuck, it's easy for parents to jump in, figure out what's going on (or peek at the answers!) and provide a little bit of help.</p></span></div>
<div>
<p>For lower-income families, Boost in a Box not only busts boredom, but brings a hard-to-access world of learning right to their doors. When you live in an under-resourced community, it can be hard to get to the library (never mind figuring out when it's open!). It can be frustrating to struggle to attend a low-cost summer program only to learn that it's just glorified baby-sitting. It's hard to keep up your school skills with few books and materials in the house. It's hard to love learning when your school days are fixated on test prep. </p>
<p></p>
<p>At EdBoost, we work with kids from all backgrounds and every kind of family. We work with gifted kids and kids with learning difficulties. We strive to make the brilliant kids more brilliant and help kids who struggle catch up and find their learning groove. </p>

We know that not everyone can donate or subscribe. We would love strong word of mouth! Please post this campaign to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and talk it up!
For every subscriber/donor you refer, we'll donate another hands-on Boost Activity. At the end of the campaign, we'll let you know how many little lives you just enriched! Please spread the word and provide a BOOST not only to kids you know but the kids who need it most.

Some Boost in a Box order details: If you purchase a box, please look out for an email from us.  We'll send a link so that the child (or the child's parent) can fill out a questionnaire and customize his or her box.  If the box is a gift, we will send you a form to fill out so that we can get the questionnaire to the recipient (or gather some basic info from you so we can surprise the child with the first box). 
If you donate, please watch our Facebook page and Instagram for photos of kids enjoying their boxes and activities!  Also, keep an eye out for your contribution receipt for your taxes next year!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/><p>I am looking for some support to cover the tuition fees for my M.Mus. course in Ethnomusicology at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. I was offered unconditional admission to this course which starts September 2015.</p>
<p>Music and foreign cultures have always been my passion. I have learned Indian classical music since 1995 and have performed with my instrument in Germany, the U.K., France, Italy, Hungary, India (see above ;-) and Indonesia so far. I have been awarded an ICCR scholarship to study at university in India in 2010 and will finish my M.A. in Instrumental Music at Rabindra Bharati University in Kolkata this summer. So far, I have learned the five Indian languages Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Tamil and Sanskrit.</p>
<p>At SOAS in London, I would like to learn about Central Asian music and Persian language. I believe that music and literature are important and powerful media of intercultural exchange that can contribute to the mutual understanding of peoples. I firmly believe that the study of foreign cultures is also essential to gain insight in the roots of cultural conflicts and to find solutions to them.</p>
<p>I am especially interested in the study of different forms of Sufi music and poetry, which are an expression of a moderate and tolerant interpretation of Islam that promotes the peaceful coexistence of world religions.</p>
<p>I am not able to cover my study fees of 10,000 EUR at SOAS in the U.K. on my own. I am a German citizen who has pursued his higher education in India and am therefore ineligible for many scholarships or exchange programs. These mostly focus either on persons having studied in Germany (the Germany-to-U.K. scholarship programs) or Indian citizens having studied and lived in India (the India-to-UK scholarship programs). Additionally, my chosen subject of study ethnomusicology is a rare and quite exotic one which does not receive much support from any public or private funding organisations.</p>
<p>Because I am tied up with the preparations for my final M.A. exams in India, I am also not able to raise any substantial amount by doing a job here at the moment.</p>
<p>The lack of funding opportunities puts me in a difficult spot. This why I chose Indiegogo.com as a platform to attempt raising a part of my study fees. Please support me and contribute if you can. It would help me to come a step closer to my dream of further studies in Ethnomusicology in the U.K.</p>
<p>I am grateful for any help you can give me.</p>

<br/><h3>Thank you for taking a look at our project to help kids and families get healthier while (virtually) traveling our planet!<br/>
</h3>
<p>We are Jan and Liz Hunter, the founders, operators and production crew of Bike-O-Vision indoor cycling. That’s right, there are only two of us!  <br/></p>
<p>We’ve put our heart and soul into this endeavor and forged forward by financing it all ourselves.  Now we’re looking for a boost to take it all to the next level- and for a great cause - kids!</p>
<h3>We need to raise funds to 
promote this program and get it into more schools.</h3>WHY?   1.)   Health:  Childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years.  Obesity is the result of “caloric imbalance”—too few calories expended for the amount of calories consumed. (Source:  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) <br/><br/>2.)   Education:  Fewer adults are traveling with children.  (Source:  US 
Travel Association).  Less than half of all Americans have ever 
been to another country.  (Source:  Bootsnall.com).  When kids see the world on Bike-O-Vision videos, preconceived falsehoods drop away and a better sense of cultures and geography emerge:  fun cycling + geography + integrated learning = better understanding.<br/><br/>Bike-O-Vision Cycling videos promote Health + Education in a fun and integrated way, and it's an activity that both kids and adults already enjoy.  And studies easily prove that exercise is an simple answer to these seriously epidemic problems.<br/><br/>New research on middle-school kids explores the link between riding and brainpower - and argues for adding more exercise into the lesson plans.  Exercise affects how you feel... can improve test scores to get better grades, helps you sleep soundly... can put you in a better mood... and very likely <i>eliminate</i> ADHD.  (Source:  John J.

</h3>So far, marketing and operational costs have limited our expansion.  Even then, we have managed to produce over 48 high definition biking, hiking and rowing videos.  So every contribution will be helping many more people experience Bike-O-Vision.<br/><br/>We are proud of our success stories!  Please take one minute to read through a few here:  <a href=""http://www.bike-o-vision.com/wins.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.bike-o-vision.com/wins.html</a>   Comments like these continue to make this adventure always rewarding!<br/><br/>Your contributions are instrumental in our short term goal of bringing even more of the world to children, families and other exercising viewers and help more people achieve their health and weight goals!   <br/><br/>Near-future goal:<br/>Our main focus this autumn will be an 
integrated-curriculum cycling program for schools across the nation and 
we want to include as many interesting geographical destinations as 
possible.  When you help kids and families connect to places around the 
world it increases their awareness, reality and understanding that we 
are all in this together!  <br/><br/><p>Long Term plan:<br/>We plan on offering all previous destinations in 4k definition and continuing to upgrade and expand.  Whether they’re students, veterans, fitness clubs, rehabilitation patients, we want EVERYONE to benefit from cardiovascular exercise using our motivating imagery of some of the best places on our beautiful planet!  And as time goes on, we hope to offer more and more exotic destinations.<br/><br/>The Challenge:  What we have endeavored to achieve here is huge:  there are just so many amazing places in the world to show.  And yet we’ve gotten off to a great start perfecting the forward-motion format by responding to customer feedback and continuing to evolve with the latest video technology.  Can we produce 16 more videos this year alone?  With your help, absolutely!  Then we can get these videos to more and more viewers!</p>
Funding objectives:  <br/><p>$6,000 or 25%:  Promotional campaign, which will utilize direct mailings, Constant Contact, Google Adwords and social media.</p>

Our first Adaptive 2.0 Digital Course, ‘Mastering Fundamentals of Physics’ went live August 2014.  This is the first of 10 STEM oriented digital courses that we hope to develop.  Production of ‘Mastering Fundamentals of Physics’ was overseen and taught by Dr. Nish Sonwalkar in close relationship with University of Massachusetts Boston.  High-schools around the country have already implemented this digital course as part of a blended learning approach to preparing their students for the Physics B/C Advanced Placement Tests.

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">This idea came in my mind when I saw news over the News Channels after the massive earthquake hit Nepal on 25th April 2015. There have been many funds and donations coming into Nepal and are only focused into Kathmandu. Many countries has donated millions of Dollars in aid and unaccounted rescue work in Nepal. Most of them are only focused into Kathmandu valley only. There has been many other places in Nepal where the Massive Earthquake had destroyed millions of dollars of property and took 1000's of human lives. Many volunteer are working in this field of rescue and distribution of aids to affected people of Gorkha, Sindhupalchok, Nuwakot, Lamjung, Rasuwa, Sagarmatha, Mustang, Sloukhumbu, Ramechap, Dolakha, Nuwakot and many other remote villages, but due to the insufficient funds and resources volunteers are not able to provide sufficient reliefs and aids to the people of most affected areas. So, to help those people who are mostly affected into remote areas, this camping is very important. Please donate whatever you can to this humanitarian campaign. Your single Dollar helps to give some relief to the victims.

<p>The focus of this campaign is to raise $2000 for the design, construction and outfitting of the STEAM Roller.  The funds will be directed toward the purchase of building materials for the cart itself, tools, supplies and educational resources for STEAM project ideas.  The TPVS teachers will proceed to develop projects that address the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) for each grade level.  Once the fundraising is complete, construction of the STEAM Roller will take place during the 2017-18 academic year with the assistance of students.</p>

Seeing the needs in rural regions of Colombia, we feel the call to help and impact on the integral development of children through the Arts.One condition to be part of the team “SEMILLEROS ARTÍSTICOS” is:Passion for arts and conviction of its unquestionable impact on the children's lives. Thanks to contributors, in 2007, 2008 and 2009, with the collabotation of the LETEO Association (leteo.org), and during the first semester of 2017, with the collaboration of NEMCATACOA Fundation, we could realize our dream: to develop the workshop ""SEMILLEROS ARTÍSTICOS"", in the Municipality of Madrid, and in the village of Hatillo, both in the Department of Cundinamarca, Colombia.This was a wonderful experience where we could check the impact on the participating children:
they developed skills to solve unexpected situations
they continually practiced respect, teamwork, solidarity and patience
they progressed in everything related to language and ability to communicate
they improved their socialization, their self-control
they understood better their role in the community
they discovered talents for their future life projects.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>Joseph Melvin Madeo was born February 2, 1985, in San Francisco, CA. He grew up in Sequim, WA. A gifted artist from a young age, Joe had his first art show in elementary school. After graduating from Sequim High School, he attended The Art Institute of Seattle with the help of several scholarships. He was awarded best portfolio of his graduating class.</p>
<p>Joe followed his heart &amp; dreams and moved to New York where he went on to become a jack of all trades, finding success in fashion design, custom bike building, carpentry, and most notably fine art. A true optimist and visionary, Joe set his mind to something and did it. His positive attitude and mischievous demeanor remained even up to the very end of his life. Joe passed away March 20, 2014 after a 4 year battle with cancer. Joe made the most of his short time on earth. Those of us lucky enough to have know Joe will always remember him and his amazing talent.</p>
<p>In his memory, I am organizing (with the blessing of Joe's family and loved ones) a memorial scholarship campaign. The money raised will be used for the sole purpose of awarding scholarships to students from an arts school in Bronx, New York.  I am the Principal there.  If you would like to learn more about the school, please see <a href=""http://www.ccbxhsm.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ccbxhsm.org</a>.</p>
<p>It is our hope that we will raise enough money so that the scholarship can live on indefinitely and become self supporting.  Until then there will be an annual drive.</p>
<p>Depending on the amount raised, scholarships will be awarded in a range of $500 to $1,500.  These will be awarded to candidates that meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>Enrolled in a 4 year college for the 2016-2017 school year</p>
<p>Have a GPA of 2.0 or higher</p>
<p>Have  demonstrated financial need*</p>
<p>Complete an application and essay that describes the impact of the arts on their lives.</p>

<p>I’ve always dreamed of studying at a great university, and this year I was accepted (see my <a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-m3hTvMAWBcRm5xVmlZRHRGVGs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Letter of Offer</a>) in the <strong><a href=""https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-neuroscience?wssl=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MSc of Neuroscience </a> at the<a href=""http://www.ox.ac.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> University of Oxford</a></strong> ; I’m super happy :D ! .

This program will enable me to fully explore and study the brain through various focuses, from single neurons to higher cognitive functions which define intelligence.

</div><div> <h3>Who am I ?</h3>
<p>I’m David Alvarez and I graduated as an engineer at the end of last year (2016). Because of my high academic performance I was selected as the first beneficiary of an exchange scholarship for doing a research project (my thesis) in Switzerland. I was able to <a href=""http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7850281/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">publish this work</a>  in an international IEEE conference. I also obtained the highest final GPA in the Engineering faculty and because of this I was distinguished at my graduation ceremony.</p>
<p>I’m passionate about the “study of intelligence” from different perspectives such as Neurosciences, Artificial Intelligence and Probability Theory. I enjoy playing the piano (see my <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZgN6UKNMg4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">waltz</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxPSWEFLZEQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">pop</a> piano interpretations) and accordion (see me playing <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11w83jp2x40"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">waltz</a> and<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0H9w5i4J1U"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Vallenato</a>). I’m a “soft” vegetarian: In my everyday life, I don’t eat meat, but when I go to new places or meet new people, I love trying new things so I’m open to eating anything in these particular situations.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What will I use the money for:</h3>
<p>All the money I raise will go towards paying a part of the<strong> USD $27,000 (£21,000)</strong> for the tuition fee, and for covering the <a href=""https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/fees-and-funding/living-costs?wssl=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">living expenses</a> which are of minimum <strong>USD $15500 (£12,000).</strong></p>
<p>If I raise more than the established goal, I will use this funds to <a href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/204456408-How-much-does-Indiegogo-cost-Fees-Pricing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">pay Indiegogo’s platform fees and credit card fees</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If I do not meet the funding goal (or I am to far from it),</strong> I will use all the funds to study Neurosciences in another Master’s in which I have been accepted, at EPFL (Computer Sciences with a minor in Neurosciences) or University of Edinburgh (Informatics with focus in Neural Computation)</p>

Why I'm doing this campaign!
I’ve always dreamed of studying at a great university, and this year I was accepted (see my Letter of Offer) in the MSc of Neuroscience  at the University of Oxford ; I’m super happy :D ! . Oxford is ranked as one of the best universities in the world . This program will enable me to fully explore and study the brain through various focuses, from single neurons to higher cognitive functions which define intelligence. The program will also prepare me for my future research endeavors in a PhD.
As a foreign student not from UK/EU, the tuition fees at Oxford are three times higher! And they total USD $27,000 (£21,000). Add to this the high cost of living expenses at Oxford, and the program greatly surpasses my financial capacity.
I have not been awarded any of the scholarships of Oxford, and as a recently graduated middle class Colombian engineer, it is truly out of my reach to cover the cost of this masters. I’ve applied for a loan to cover part of the tuition, and in this crowdfunding campaign I’m kindly asking you to help me raise USD $18,000 to cover part of the remaining costs, and to invest in the future of someone committed with the study of Neurosciences and Artificial Intelligence :).

with your help we can do that in a fun and creative way that also
benefits our visitors.  Once upon a time this sort of activity would
have been a normal part of childhood but is sadly a rare treat in the
modern world.
We
can do all this and more for E10 000.  We have some really fun perks
including a homemade bow carved from one piece of wood, and a
weekend's Glamping in the woods.  It would
be great if you could contribute to our campaign but it would also
help if you could share it with as many people as possible. Thank you.Tom, Lucy, Gus, Albert, Honor, Noah and Sofia.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><h3><b>We
are putting Chicago Booth MBAs on the road</b></h3>
<p>We
are four MBA students at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business who are starting a program that
will allow the next generation of MBAs to help communities across America.</p>
<p><b>MBAs want to do social impact work;
startups want them to help out </b></p>
<p>Today’s
MBA students are passionate and want to do socially focused work, however,
many of them don’t follow this path. Instead, they pursue more traditional jobs
in the corporate world without having had a chance to explore the social
entrepreneurship perspective.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,
there are many young, mission-driven startups that need additional sets of
hands and would benefit greatly from the MBAs but don’t have access to them
because they’re somewhere remote or simply can’t afford it.</p>
<p><b>Chicago Road Ventures program will
match MBAs with startups</b></p>
<p>After
MBAs finish their traditional summer internships, our program, Chicago Road
Ventures, will offer teams of MBAs an actual opportunity to explore pro bono
work over a short but very intense period of 2-3 weeks.</p>
<p>These
teams will work with entrepreneurs in the more remote locations of our country
– away from Chicago, New York, or San Francisco – to help them solve some of
their most challenging business problems.</p>
<p>Our
teams will work with entrepreneurs one week at a time. The goal is to dig deep
and immerse ourselves in business problems that will help these companies grow.</p>
<p><b>The homework is done – the program
operations are set in place</b></p>
<p>We
have already found over 60 incoming Chicago Booth students who are excited to
join the CRV program next year. Meanwhile, we have also received applications
from a number of entrepreneurs eager to work with CRV
teams. Entrepreneurs like a health-focused tech startup in
Louisville, Kentucky looking to improve the patient experience and a
construction payment platform in New Orleans looking to support small businesses.
 And the school administration is willing to support this program next
year, once we've shown that the program works. </p>
<p>This
is why we are setting up a pilot for this summer. The team will consist of the
four of us – Chris, Emma, Kevin, and Simon. We met each other during our first
year at Booth through our common interest in social impact.  All of us
have been active contributors to the Chicagoland community throughout our first
year at Chicago Booth and want to expand this impact through this program. We have
worked together to create this program using our experiences from our
careers. </p>

<p>The
four of us are committed to this movement and have already sketched out plans
to hit the road. But at this stage, we need your help. We need funding to drive
across the country and put ourselves up when the entrepreneurs don’t have room
for us. Any funding left over, we’ll put into the program for next year, along
with the funding and support that the University of Chicago has indicated they'll provide.</p>
<p>But
this initial pilot is on us. So please help us get this thing on the road!</p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p><p>As
 the actual work is pro bono, we are
looking to cover the travel expenses incurred through the four of us during the
three-week pilot in September:</p><span></span>
<p><b>We
expect the overall costs for the pilot trip to be $4,500</b></p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<b style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Accommodation 21 nights for 4 people :   $2,000</b>

</span>
</li>

</li>
<li><b style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Gas (assuming startups in KY, LA, TX)  :    $   500</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Should
the travel expenses in the end be more, we are willing to cover it
out-of-pocket. But as we are asking the startups to help us with accommodation
and other cost items, we are hoping to use less than what we've budgeted.
Should we have some money leftover at the end of the pilot, it will directly go
back into the program and will benefit the teams next year. </p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(128, 0, 0);"">The
impact of your support goes beyond the pilot!</b></p>
<p>Our
goal is to create a lasting impact at Chicago Booth that is sustained long
after we graduate so classes after our own can participate, add their own
ideas, and grow the program. We have seen from similar programs, such as MBAx,
that the impact is impressive and now want to bring it to the University of Chicago
community! </p>
<p>Chicago Road Ventures will allow these MBA teams to learn the real life
struggles of social businesses while having a meaningful impact and explore new
places. As it is directed at 1st-years, it offers them an opportunity in the
second half of their summer to explore the world of social entrepreneurship in
addition to their full-time internships without forcing them to choose
between the two, enabling more teams to go out and make a difference.<br/></p>
<p>Entrepreneurs
will each benefit from an intense week of pre-scoped, hands-on support from a
dynamic team of former consultants, entrepreneurs, and business developers. We
have a bias for action and want to get our hands dirty. Equally importantly, we
want to continue having an impact – even after we leave town. We see this as an
opportunity to build some lasting pro bono relationships with key entrepreneurs
and will follow up throughout the year.</p>
<p>Not
only would you be supporting the four of us to help three young U.S. startups this
September, but your money will go to prove the success of the collaboration of
MBAs and startups in the future. After all, through your support, we will be
able to prove the success of the program and the will
support the future teams. </p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(128, 0, 0);"">There
are also other ways you can help!</b></p>
<p>The
funds we are gathering are going directly to cover our travel expenses during
the pilot, such as accommodation, car rental, gas for the car and incidental &amp; emergency expenses for 3
weeks.</p>
<p>So
you can help us out with any of the above directly in non-monetary form!</p>
<p>And
if you know of someone who would be interested in helping small startups across
the USA with MBAs, please spread the word and send them the link to our
campaign through any of the Indiegogo share tools. <br/><br/>Thanks for reading this, and let us know if you've got any questions or want to help in some way.</p>

with the funding and support that the University of Chicago has indicated they'll provide.
But
this initial pilot is on us. So please help us get this thing on the road!
As
 the actual work is pro bono, we are
looking to cover the travel expenses incurred through the four of us during the
three-week pilot in September:
We
expect the overall costs for the pilot trip to be $4,500


Accommodation 21 nights for 4 people :   $2,000


Incidentals & Contingencies                    :    $1,500 



Car rental (with University discount)     :    $   500

Gas (assuming startups in KY, LA, TX)  :    $   500

Should
the travel expenses in the end be more, we are willing to cover it
out-of-pocket. But as we are asking the startups to help us with accommodation
and other cost items, we are hoping to use less than what we've budgeted.
Should we have some money leftover at the end of the pilot, it will directly go
back into the program and will benefit the teams next year. 
The
impact of your support goes beyond the pilot!
Our
goal is to create a lasting impact at Chicago Booth that is sustained long
after we graduate so classes after our own can participate, add their own
ideas, and grow the program. We have seen from similar programs, such as MBAx,
that the impact is impressive and now want to bring it to the University of Chicago
community! 
Chicago Road Ventures will allow these MBA teams to learn the real life
struggles of social businesses while having a meaningful impact and explore new
places. As it is directed at 1st-years, it offers them an opportunity in the
second half of their summer to explore the world of social entrepreneurship in
addition to their full-time internships without forcing them to choose
between the two, enabling more teams to go out and make a difference.
Entrepreneurs
will each benefit from an intense week of pre-scoped, hands-on support from a
dynamic team of former consultants, entrepreneurs, and business developers. We
have a bias for action and want to get our hands dirty. Equally importantly, we
want to continue having an impact – even after we leave town. We see this as an
opportunity to build some lasting pro bono relationships with key entrepreneurs
and will follow up throughout the year.
Not
only would you be supporting the four of us to help three young U.S. startups this
September, but your money will go to prove the success of the collaboration of
MBAs and startups in the future. After all, through your support, we will be
able to prove the success of the program and the will
support the future teams. 
There
are also other ways you can help!
The
funds we are gathering are going directly to cover our travel expenses during
the pilot, such as accommodation, car rental, gas for the car and incidental & emergency expenses for 3
weeks.
So
you can help us out with any of the above directly in non-monetary form!
And
if you know of someone who would be interested in helping small startups across
the USA with MBAs, please spread the word and send them the link to our
campaign through any of the Indiegogo share tools. Thanks for reading this, and let us know if you've got any questions or want to help in some way.
Yours,
Chris,

<p>Imagine this: a dietician is promoting a nutrition plan in a school, encouraging students to eat apples.</p>
<p>This is a stereotyped approach – students are told to eat apples with each meal, three meals a day, apples are cooked with rice, with soup, and with every dish. Students are fed up with apples after they eat apples for three years. Eventually, all students lose their appetite for apples.</p>
<p>This is another approach – instead of giving students apples, dietitian produce videos to present the crumbly texture, the savor, and the mouth-melting taste of apples to the students. When students see people eating apples with relish and enjoyment, they simply cannot resist the temptation of apples.</p>
<p>After school all students rush homes and start looking for apples. They eat apples today, tomorrow, day after day. Eating apples becomes a hobby. </p>
<p>It’s the same for education. If kids are forced to learn something, they may learn it for a while but will lose their interest sooner or later.</p>
<p>But if we can motivate kids and inspire them to enjoy learning something, they will learn it initiatively for the rest of their lives.</p>

Kids learn and teach all by themselves!                                                   Wow, Kids are teachers. Fantastic !Kids study and check data seriously, work with each other and write textbooks on their own. Here, kids educate each other and respect each other.Schooling is not boring anymore. Most importantly, kids learn better as they teach each other.As soon as you walk into the school, you see all kids excited about the coming classes, talking with each other about who teaches better.What are the roles of students?This is the most exciting part！  School is made up of students. Why not give students a chance to handle their classes? This is the idea behind the dream school – giving students a chance to run their school.Students run their school. Amazing!  Don’t be surprised to see it happen in a real world.In this school, students can…



Teach. Design courses for other kids                                                                           Before, all courses were taught by teachers.                                                               Now, students design and teach all courses, mathematics, electronics, quantum mechanics, guitar, philosophy, and so on.You can teach whatever course you like.


Create student societies                                                                                   Students and their hobby friends can create all kinds of societies                         unfettered by the bounds of reality, such as watermelon eaters’ society, shy boys’ society, and integral study society, to name just a few.                                   All kinds of fascinating societies are waiting to be created.


Give speeches                                                                                                           Whats?  Now you can have your own speech. Unbelievable!                                       Students can choose all kinds of topics for their speeches.Yes, all kinds of topics, even the daily trifles, tips for daily life, book reviews, and the philosophy of life.


Organize events                                                                                                        Everyday is like a holiday. Students can arrange all kinds of events as they wish, such as hundred guitar players’ day, scientific fiction day, cosplay...           Students can also work with other schools to arrange whatever events they like, for example, computer program contest event, book launch, graffiti festival, etc.


Make your dream come true                                                                                           Do you want to create a computer game? Do you care to produce a  marvelous cartoon to catch everybody’s attention?                                                                         Here, you can find friends with same ideals and beliefs so you can work together to make your dreams come true.






What is the idea behind this dream school?
For one thing – happiness                                                                                                          Learning is important, but learning happily is more important than learning itself.
Imagine this: a dietician is promoting a nutrition plan in a school, encouraging students to eat apples.
This is a stereotyped approach – students are told to eat apples with each meal, three meals a day, apples are cooked with rice, with soup, and with every dish. Students are fed up with apples after they eat apples for three years. Eventually, all students lose their appetite for apples.
This is another approach – instead of giving students apples, dietitian produce videos to present the crumbly texture, the savor, and the mouth-melting taste of apples to the students. When students see people eating apples with relish and enjoyment, they simply cannot resist the temptation of apples.
After school all students rush homes and start looking for apples. They eat apples today, tomorrow, day after day. Eating apples becomes a hobby. 
It’s the same for education. If kids are forced to learn something, they may learn it for a while but will lose their interest sooner or later.
But if we can motivate kids and inspire them to enjoy learning something, they will learn it initiatively for the rest of their lives.

What can students expect from the dream school?
Lots of confidence and motivation.
Here, you can study calculus, organic chemistry, fluid mechanics... although you are not yet a college student. With your burning desire, you can study whatever course you like, no matter how difficult it is.

Do you have elite class and low-grade class in the school?
This is the best part. In this school, everybody is valued; nobody is treated as a fool. No exam in this school. No exam means no ranking; no ranking means no fool.
Even if you cannot study well, you still can discuss the course with friends or lecture your classmates on the course.
Wait a minute; you are going to teach something you don’t really understand?
You’re right. Teaching is a powerful tool for learning. Everybody need it, no matter you are a quick learner or a slow learner. That’s so cool!

Why is it important for everybody to feel valued?
There are 7 billion people in this world. It makes no sense to count on the top people – only 1% of the world’s population – to change our world for us. Elite education does not serve our needs in this information-bursting era.
1% of the world’s population has changed our world by leaps and bounds. If 100% of the world’s population is respected and valued, it will be very difficult to imagine how much we can change our world.

What to do after study?
You don’t have to wait until you grow up. You can start your big dreams right here, right now!What, I can start my dream now? That’s unbelievable.
Here, you can study for your dreams, not for scores and exams.
Do you care to build a spaceship? Do you want to invent the greatest mathematical theorem in the history?
Here, you can make a team with friends and pursue the knowledge needed for your goals. Kids’ dreams start from now on! not 10 years later.

Who are eligible?
12-18 years old. We don’t care if one is a talent or a fool. With artless dreams and passions, everybody is welcome to join us.

<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">For Orphan Children in the country of Benin, the year-end Holiday season is a time when deeply buried feelings of exclusion bubble up to the surface.  Non-Orphan children in West Africa are deeply tied to family, ancestry and cultural traditions. The absence of family influences and traditions in the life of an Orphan, often compels that Child to construct an inner reality that is rooted in feelings of abandonment.   And there's no time like Christmas and other family-centric holidays, to remind an orphan child that he/she is alone in the world.   A time in which their young</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> adolescent hearts should be replete with joy and laughter, is instead filled with agony and dread.  After all, most of their caretakers will leave to go spend Christmas with their own families; and local children in the surrounding neighborhoods---who have parents, will be celebrating and showing off their new toys and gifts.  </span>

<br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">We all know what its like to feel left out----- but to simultaneously feel ""Left Out"" and ""Less Than"" during Christmas,  is to experience an emotional trauma that unfolds in three acts:  discovery, distress; and, ultimately detachment.   The psychological impact to children who repeatedly experience this year after year, is akin to PTSD.   </span><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Norberka's </b>efforts to introduce these children to the modern ceremonial practice of holiday-themed gift giving; encourages them to feel more acknowledged, loved and nurtured; resulting in a vitally cathartic experience that lovingly ushers each child towards a path of recovery from feelings of abandonment, harbored deep within their tender hearts. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">     </span>

<p>If you look at the photos on this page or watch the <b>music video</b> above, you will see Norberka, her band members and dancers,  all adorned in various styles of Krobo bracelets and necklaces that are similar to the ones being offered as perks below.   These beaded bracelets and necklaces are handcrafted by Artisans who originate from the Krobo mountains of Ghana.    These people have been crafting beaded bracelets and necklaces since the stone age.  They are much sought after throughout West Africa for their exquisite level of craftsmanship and attention to detail.  </p>
<p>The <b>Bracelets and Necklaces are made from Recycled glass</b> bottles that are crushed into powder, then poured into molds in order to create the appealing shaped beads. Decorations on the beads are made with a paste consisting of colored glass powder and water, which is applied using a thin wooden stalk. They are baked twice to fix the decor.  Since ancient times, these artisans have always utilized <b>Sustainable and Eco-friendly</b> practices in the crafting of these beads.  <br/></p>
<p>Each Bracelet and/or Necklace is <b>unique</b> and so you will not receive the exact same beads shown below, but something similar in craftsmanship.  Bracelets are adjustable to fit all Wrist sizes equally.   The perks will be sent to you sometime in late December 2015, so expect delivery around early January.  </p>

Thank you for taking time out of your day to read about our project.  We hope our story will inspire you to help us meet our goal to provide school supplies and spread Holiday cheer to over 500 Orphan children in the country of Benin this December....  And, you'll also get some unique and fantastic Perks for contributing!  



We are Little Angels Children's Charities; an American charitable organization, recently set up to provide direct financial and logistical support to Amour du Prochain Fondation, a Benin based NGO founded by the highly celebrated, award winning lyricist and traditional West African entertainer, Norberka.   The name of the NGO literally translates to ""Love thy Neighbor"" Foundation.  




For the past four years, Norberka has gone to great lengths to spread Holiday cheer to hundreds of Orphaned children who yearn to feel wanted and acknowledged, particularly during the holiday season.  Every December 25th, in her hometown of Sahoué Doutou, Benin---Norberka puts on a free Live music concert and also contributes a large portion of her yearly earnings to purchase food, gifts and school supplies for as many orphan children as her funds will support.   Furthermore, she expends a great deal of  energy to rally the town dignitaries, the local king, volunteers;  and insures that they not only commit to being present at the event; but also agree to give speeches to honor the children.  



In addition to its yearly Holiday obligations, the foundation also seeks to provide school supplies for each Orphan child during the fall & winter semesters.   Without parents to purchase backpacks, writing instruments, notebooks and even clothing for school, these children are often deprived of the tools that are minimally required, just to be considered a prepared student.  In some cases, students are 100% responsible for purchasing their own textbooks.   With your support, we are confident that we'll be able to meet their needs in this regard.  


On this side of the Atlantic, we've dug into deep into our pockets and did what we could on a personal level to help support Norberka's cause, over the past four years.   However, this year we decided to wise up, incorporate and file for a 501(c)3 non-profit, in order to attract support from a wider audience.  And by the end of 2015, we'll also be able to provide tax deductible receipts to our sponsors.    






Impact: A Child's Nourishment Defines His Capacity


For Orphan Children in the country of Benin, the year-end Holiday season is a time when deeply buried feelings of exclusion bubble up to the surface.  Non-Orphan children in West Africa are deeply tied to family, ancestry and cultural traditions. The absence of family influences and traditions in the life of an Orphan, often compels that Child to construct an inner reality that is rooted in feelings of abandonment.   And there's no time like Christmas and other family-centric holidays, to remind an orphan child that he/she is alone in the world.   A time in which their young adolescent hearts should be replete with joy and laughter, is instead filled with agony and dread.  After all, most of their caretakers will leave to go spend Christmas with their own families; and local children in the surrounding neighborhoods---who have parents, will be celebrating and showing off their new toys and gifts.  





We all know what its like to feel left out----- but to simultaneously feel ""Left Out"" and ""Less Than"" during Christmas,  is to experience an emotional trauma that unfolds in three acts:  discovery, distress; and, ultimately detachment.   The psychological impact to children who repeatedly experience this year after year, is akin to PTSD.   Norberka's efforts to introduce these children to the modern ceremonial practice of holiday-themed gift giving; encourages them to feel more acknowledged, loved and nurtured; resulting in a vitally cathartic experience that lovingly ushers each child towards a path of recovery from feelings of abandonment, harbored deep within their tender hearts.      





Nourishing Their Minds, Bodies and Souls: 

It's not just about the Holidays.  In keeping with a holistic approach to serving the overall needs of each orphan, the foundation will utilize some of the funds raised through this project, to purchase enough school supplies to last these kids an entire school year.   

You can make a real difference this year by Helping us pool enough resources to provide School Supplies, Food and Toys to over 500 Orphan children this year. Your support will go a long way to helping each and every child feel ""included"" and ""acknowledged."".   Support our project.  Make a big impact today!   And do check out some of the unique and wonderful Perks that you will receive, as a show of appreciation!  

   What We Need & How We'll Show YOU Appreciation:


Our goal is to raise $30,000 this year to provide school supplies, toys and 1 week worth of food to each of the 500 children!  But, if we can exceed the initial goal of this project, many more children beyond the expected 500 will be included in this years Holiday-themed charity event.   

Your donation will go towards the foundation's 2015 Holiday Orphan budget.   Last December 2014, Norberka's Amour Du Prochain Foundation provided toys and a few days worth of food for nearly 500 children.   This year, we hope to be able to provide them with food, toys along with school supplies.   We're asking you to Help us feed their minds, bodies and souls. 


Reciprocity is a strong feature of African society; it is, in fact, a feature of any well-meaning community of sentient beings.   In Benin,  a thank you is often demonstrated in the form of a reciprocal act, not just with words.   The young orphans who will benefit from your generosity,  yearn for the opportunity to demonstrate their thanks to you.   Therefore, you can also expect a personalized thank you note from them and, in addition, these children will also have some input into the selection of the Perk(s) that you will receive, with the full understanding that this is their way to show you gratitude and appreciation.     

The Perks:  A Glimpse into West African Reciprocity


If you look at the photos on this page or watch the music video above, you will see Norberka, her band members and dancers,  all adorned in various styles of Krobo bracelets and necklaces that are similar to the ones being offered as perks below.   These beaded bracelets and necklaces are handcrafted by Artisans who originate from the Krobo mountains of Ghana.    These people have been crafting beaded bracelets and necklaces since the stone age.  They are much sought after throughout West Africa for their exquisite level of craftsmanship and attention to detail.  
The Bracelets and Necklaces are made from Recycled glass bottles that are crushed into powder, then poured into molds in order to create the appealing shaped beads. Decorations on the beads are made with a paste consisting of colored glass powder and water, which is applied using a thin wooden stalk. They are baked twice to fix the decor.  Since ancient times, these artisans have always utilized Sustainable and Eco-friendly practices in the crafting of these beads.  
Each Bracelet and/or Necklace is unique and so you will not receive the exact same beads shown below, but something similar in craftsmanship.  Bracelets are adjustable to fit all Wrist sizes equally.   The perks will be sent to you sometime in late December 2015, so expect delivery around early January.

In developing countries, boys are sent for education while girls stay at home working and providing for their families. Without education, the girls are susceptible to early marriage, kidnapping, rape, and premature death secondary to early childbirth. Trends show that poverty can be eliminated within a single generation by educating the girls within that community. The story of Ubo (""beautiful"" in the Oromo language, spoken in parts of Ethiopia) (Ubo in the early morning hours preparing charcoal mix to make local coffee)Meet Ubo, one of the girls sponsored through the Tangible Hope Foundation. We met Ubo during housing construction in Kofele for a family of eight who were sleeping, cooking, and living with their livestock in a small, single-room mud hut. At seven years old, Ubo worked as though she were an adult; sweeping floors, churning milk into butter, cooking, and preparing charcoal to make coffee. One day Lily, founder of Tangible Hope, decided to chat with Ubo. Lily took a photo of Ubo and decided to show her what she looked like. Ubo having never seen her own image, exclaimed ""I didn't know I was so beautiful."" Lily knew she had to help these girls, she had to end this cycle of poverty and instill in them, the ability to realize their true potential through education. That day, Lily made the decision to ensure that no girl would grow up without knowing how beautiful she was, or without the opportunity of education. Upon returning to Ethiopia, Lily went in search of Ubo. After a few days of searching,  Lily discovered the terrible news -- Ubo had been raped. The rapist had been caught, but the damage was done. Despite her suffering, Ubo is now going to school  through Tangible Hope Foundation, and leading a normal life. Medical treatment provided for Ubo showed that she is healthy. Ubo's hard work, maturity, independence, and resilience make her the embodiment of the Tangible Hope Foundation .                    
Your donation will help in the following ways:1.) Construction of the Adu Darara (Sun Seed) Educational Center — an educational compound that serves as a safe haven for the girls. This center will protect the girls from common kidnapping and rape, and for educating the girls through after school programs. We have the land and the blueprints are completed. Our next step is construction -- in October we will begin fencing and digging.   2.) Provide nutrition for the girls and their families — This ensures families do not pull the girls out of school and put them to work as household workers. 3.) Create sustainability programs for the girls to carry the next generation out of poverty.4.) Sponsorship of girls — $1 dollar a day/$365 a year can sustain a girl educationally, medically, physically, and hygienically, and provide their families the means to ensure the girls continue their education.  5.) Transportation for our team to provide whatever means necessary to continue to educate and empower the next generation of young women, and alleviate poverty, common practice of rape, kidnapping, and early marriage in susceptible areas of Ethiopia. Who we are and what we do:Tangible Hope is currently sponsoring 51 young girls in Kofele, Ethiopia. By continuing to grow our sponsorship base and forming new partnerships, our goal is to increase the number of girls by at least an additional 50 girls yearly so we can continue to provide and expand our after school programs as well as improve hygiene and provide daily nutritious meals for the girls. By engaging the girls' families socially and monetarily with suppling grains and cooking oils, the families are able to keep the girls in Tangible Hope Foundation’s sponsorship program instead of making their daughters abandon school to help support the family. In using this model, Tangible Hope strives to empower young girls in order to realize their full potential and to help put an end to poverty in Ethiopia.Meet our Team:Telile ""Lily"" Yoseph, (Founder)Janet Dean, (Treasurer)Marisa Ruth (Director of Interns, Volunteer basis)Mima Geelani ( Development & Sustainability Coordinator, Volunteer basis)

<p>Along with great music this campaign has another mission; to help the plight of orangutans in Borneo today. Orangutans are facing extinction due to factors like illegal logging, forest conversion, large scale palm oil cultivation, fires, border disputes with local people, and jurisdictional disputes among government departments.  So as a part of this campaign 50% of all t-shirt profits will go to orphaned orangutans in Borneo.

<p>And when we reach our goal, we'll then have the funds to create a children's book about Afunky's first day at preschool.  The book will be an educational tool for teachers, parents and child care providers to help with children that may have trouble on their first day of school.

Following a RAWLICIOUS plant-based lifestyle is super-sexy and enhances the real beauty within.                     'It's not always about the money money money'              'We just wanna promote raw lifestyle, forget about the cooking'YUUGA Kemistri is the fastest growing raw food coach in the UK today and has held over 200 classes since February 2013, and more than 2,400 raw food enthusiasts have got to enjoy learning about the significance of eating healthy and taking care of their temple, i.e. their body. With a growing company we have a growing array of amazing and life changing products to offer you. Ranging from our 4 Weeks on Raw meal plan, gorgeous ‘One Day Blissfully Raw’ recipes and our UK renowned un-cookery chocolate, superfood and most recently GREENTOX and Italian classes for beginners and our super raw foodies to enjoy.Due to high demand and increased interest in our classes and programmes we have decided to put together a crowdfunding page that will allow us to expand and cater for the overwhelming demand of current and future clients.HOW HAS YUUGA KEMISTRI GROWN:Yuuga Kemistri has grown quick over the past 2 years and with big events and opportunities arising we’d love to be able to expand further, or most importantly help you to grow with us, and therefore we look to you to help us with the funds to set aside for these exciting and opportunistic activities.We have BIG plans for YK such as the Raw Food Festival this summer in London which we’re expecting to be a massive hit! Also allowing our products to enter the market requires a lot of time, money and effort!Along with high demand we've happily added extra classes to the ever growing schedule. Equipment, time and space is shrinking so that is where you guys come in.In return for helping us, we will reward you with some fantastic perks that you can keep for yourself or give as a gift.Why we need YOUR help!The goal is to reach minimum £5700 but to truly meet properly, as we have envisioned, the huge demand for our products we aim to raise £9800 to cover additional costs involved in the speedy growth.This is how we will use the funds:A. Buy equipment which will be set up permanently in our London Venue:1.  Food Processors (including 2 MagiMix and Vitamix)2.  Small dehydrator3.  2 Spiralisers4.  4 set of high quality ceramic knives5.  All crockery needed for tasting and trying the food made during class6.  Storing of Material needed for tasting and using in dishes made during class. Currently all material is being transported to and from venue, before and after class.7.  Storing of equipment at the venue to make the classes a greater experience for all parties, as it will eliminate transporting heavy equipment to and from venue.B. MarketingWe intend to use 1/3 of the fund raised to increase the awareness of the classes in public with marketing (indirect and direct):  Direct approach will make the classes available to more people, skip the promotion companies, which have taken a huge proportion of the income so far, and allow YUUGA Kemistri to be the direct contact between the classes offered and the client and in that way be able to provide more flexible booking and cancelling experience.If you can’t see yourself in helping us with contribution at this time, we would love to have your help in spreading the news of our campaign. Get the word out help us to make a change for the better of good health and spreading the seedlings of the benefits of raw food. Hashtag in your comments the tag below #rawfortherecord and use the indiegogo links in this campaign and our twitter account @YUUGAKemistri so that we can thank you too!That's all there is to it now - Lets get UN-Cooking and RAWCKING in the kitchen",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>What We Need</h2>
<h4>Our goal is to raise $12,000. This money will be used for three distinct purposes:</h4>
<div>1. <b>Accomodation</b><br/>We gather the participants in Hostels. They are perfect for interaction and making new friends in short time. Hostels are cheap, but if <b>300 students</b> are going to stay  <b>7 nights</b> in a hostel in Vienna, we need your support to  accomodate everyone and avoid cutting down costs for this aspect.</div>
<div>2. <b>Food</b><br/>In order to serve our participants during their stay in Vienna, we need your support. We want to give out <b>meals 3 times a day</b> for perfect conditions. Everyone knows that we can reach our potential with the right food. To retrieve the <b>full potential</b> of the students it is necessary to offer the right meal.</div>
<div>3. <b>Materials</b><br/>We are going to arrange <b>working groups</b> and <b>seminars</b> for the students, for which <b>nametags</b>, <b>printed materials</b> and <b>handouts</b> will be used. We all know that a good seminar needs the right materials such as <b>flip charts</b>, <b>white boards</b> or <b>posters</b>. The learning experience will be significantly different. To offer the right studying atmosphere, we need your support to buy all these materials. </div>
<h2>What you get</h2>
<div>There are goods from basics to allround packages and even companies can sponsor us to make this event come true!<br/>If you are going to get a perk which offers you to interact with students such as the ""individual space"", you have the possibility to send your message and interact with the participants. <br/>We highly recommend you to come to Vienna and join our event and choose one of our perks to do so. We would be really happy to welcome you!<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
<p><b>What do I do if I want more than one perk?</b> </p>
<p>Each purchase of a perk is a new transaction, so you click on the perk you want, fill in your info, and buy it. Then, go back and select the other perk you wanted, and repeat the process.</p>
<p><b>Are smaller perks included in higher priced onces?</b></p>

International Studies, Spanish, and Theatre at the University of Alaska
Anchorage. I will be participating in a study abroad program through Academic
Programs International in Seville, Spain during the 2015/2016 academic year.
While there, I will be taking a full course load ranging from international
relations, politics, history, and the Spanish language and will take part in
various service projects throughout Spain. </p>
<p>There are many reasons why I have chosen to study abroad, one
of them being the fact that studying abroad in Spain will finally allow me to
fulfill my lifelong dream of an adventure abroad. On a more crucial note,
however, studying abroad will provide me my first chance at culturally
integrating with a country that not only has different customs and traditions,
but speaks a different language entirely. This will add to my international
worldview by providing an important opportunity for me to apply what I have
already learned from my studies at UAA and further build onto this established
foundation, thus transforming me into a cosmopolitan citizen of the world, a
goal I greatly want to achieve. A well-rounded person is not simply someone who
has read about different areas of the world, but who has visited and
experienced them, and can truly see the world from the perspective of another.
Spain has vast historical significance, therefore I would be able to gain a
deeper understanding of events learned and not yet learned in my history
courses with a different point of view. Doing so will thereby provide the
insight needed to help build a better future and avoid repeating past
mistakes. </p>
<p>Moreover, a year in Spain
will provide me with an experience that will fuel my next step towards an even
bigger goal, my future career. By allowing me to examine global issues
firsthand and practice finding solutions that will help improve the lives of
those less fortunate, I will be better prepared for my career goals after I
graduate, which include: joining the Peace Corps, beginning a career with the
Foreign Services, and/or working for a non-profit organization in an
impoverished nation. Life has taught me that I am happiest when
taking part in creating the joy of others around me, therefore I will apply
this desire towards each and every career decision I make. In sum, there is
only so much you can read in books and learn in a classroom, and my program
will provide a supplemental and real-life experience component to my formal
knowledge base, opening the necessary doors towards a future of serving those
in need and providing opportunity for greater success in my future endeavors. </p>
<p>Growing up in
a full household of seven siblings, I have long accepted the necessity to pave
my own way if I wanted to receive a higher education. With academic success and
numerous part-time and full-time jobs, I have been able to put myself through
college thus far. Unfortunately, no matter the amount I have saved, the expense of my
study abroad in Spain is inevitable. Choosing to not study abroad, however, is
out of the question, no matter the cost. It has always been my dream and I am
trying as hard as I can to make that dream come true. I have overcome many
obstacles to get to where I am today and I am confident that my constant drive
for success and academic achievements will aid in my study abroad endeavors. My
humble roots coupled with my unending desire for knowledge have and will
continue to motivate me in my pursuit of higher education and ultimately
success, a pursuit that I hope will continue to inspire my family, both young
and old, for generations to come.</p><br/></div>","Hi, my name is Teanna Hutchison and I study

Inglês, capoeira, ballet, informatico, xadrez, violão e fazer os deveres de

mantido a escola viva e próspera, a falta de patrocinadores locais ou ajuda do
estado limita em muito as suas atividades.</p>
<p>A Escolinha precisa de patrocínio para reformas, um
professor de informática, transporte para passeios e o mais importante: para manter
a organização viva. Necessitamos doação de qualquer espécie: dinheiro,
voluntários, materiais escolares, móveis de cozinha e suprimentos.</p>

lugar para estaren antes e depois da escola onde elas podem ter aulas de dança,
Inglês, capoeira, ballet, informatico, xadrez, violão e fazer os deveres de
casa. Além de excurções e passeios culturais e educativos. A escola tem como
objetivo ensinar as crianças que existem outras opções, boas escolhas e que
eles também têm e oportunidades.
   What We Need  
But Escolinha Tia Percilia
currently has only one sponsor, Insamlingsstiftelsen Gatubarn, based in Sweden. Although they have kept the school alive and
thriving, there is only so much they can do and they have no local sponsors or
help from the state.  
Escolinha Tia Percilia
needs funds for renovations, a computer teacher, transportation for field trips
and keeping the organization alive. They are asking for donation of any kind,
money, volunteers, school supplies, furniture and kitchen supplies. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




O Que Nós Precisamos

Mas Escolinha Tia Percília atualmente tem apenas um mantenedor
a fundação, Insamlingsstiftelsen Gatubarn, com sede na Suécia. Apesar de terem
mantido a escola viva e próspera, a falta de patrocinadores locais ou ajuda do
estado limita em muito as suas atividades.
A Escolinha precisa de patrocínio para reformas, um
professor de informática, transporte para passeios e o mais importante: para manter
a organização viva. Necessitamos doação de qualquer espécie: dinheiro,
voluntários, materiais escolares, móveis de cozinha e suprimentos.
   Thank you!

We are so grateful for any
help you can give us!
Thank you!
Obrigado!
Ficaremos muito agradecidos por qualquer forma de
auxílio que puder nos proporcionar!
Obrigada!

<br/><h2><b>THE DESIGN</b></h2>
<p>The first project in Dhungkharka will be a community centre complex of three rammed earth buildings, connected by a single roof. The site is a 30.0m by 6.1m plot of land on the side of a sloping hill. </p>
<br/><p>The first building houses three programs: a guest room for two beds, a small library, and a washroom/shower. The total building measures 5m by 13.6m, staying within the advised 1:3 width to length ratio. Rammed earth wall thickness at the retaining wall side is 900mm to and 450mm at all other locations. Wall height stays at 3.5m throughout the entire site.</p>
<br/><p>The second building functions as a meeting hall for village meetings and other events. The south-east facing facade is mostly open to allow for sufficient natural light, and can be closed off with a series of heavy curtains. The building measures 5m by 10.4m and wall thickness follows the pattern of the first building.</p>
<br/><p>The final building is a small shrine, formed by four L-shaped rammed earth columns at the corners. The building measures 2.8m by 3.6m. </p>
<br/><p>A lightweight roof covers all three buildings. Corrugated metal panels are attached to a series of bamboo beams which cross in both directions. At the north-west wall, the roof touches down on bamboo poles which are embedded in the thicker (900mm) rammed earth wall. At the south-east wall, bamboo posts take the weight of the roof down to the ground. </p>

</h3><h1><b>Our Mission</b></h1>
<p>Peace Love Plates is a non-profit organization providing free cooking and nutrition classes as well as the knowledge and tools necessary to cook healthy and affordable meals. We teach underprivileged individuals that cooking healthy and affordable meals doesn't have to be difficult or time consuming, and we encourage them to join around the dinner table more often with their families. It only takes a basic understanding of how to shop frugally, identify healthy and non-healthy ingredients, and how to prepare them into beautiful, nutritious meals at home to make the most of your budget and make healthier decisions.. </p>
<h1>Our Story</h1>
<p>Peace Love Plates, founded in 2013, has conducted multiple cooking and nutrition classes, reaching over 200 people from varying socioeconomic, race, and cultural background – at no cost to their students. We have developed a hands-on, nutrition based class curriculum, an instructional program used to equip and teach future class instructors, and handout material used to teach basic nutrition education. After each class, we join around a dinner table together and enjoy the meals we just cooked. With this information, our students have left our classes feeling empowered to make more informed decisions in the grocery store and their kitchen as they take small steps toward improving their own personal health. </p>
<h1>How You Can Help</h1>
<p><b>$10,000</b> - With these funds, Peace Love Plates would be able to conduct 75-100, directly impacting between <b>750-2,000</b> people. These <b>free</b> classes include our printed handout materials as well as any additional cookware, raw materials, and promotional expenses needed.</p>
<p><b>$60,000</b> – This funding will allow us to hire a full time Program Director for one year that would conduct daily operating tasks including logistically organizing and conducting cooking our free classes on a weekly basis, program research and development, fundraising and promotion, network expansion through mutual partnerships, brand management, and establishing Peace Love Plates as a highly recognized organization.</p>
<p><b>$100,000</b> - Our biggest stretch goal would allow us to conduct the 75-100 classes, hire a full-time Program Director, and hire part time employees and offer paid internship programs to young students interested in cooking, nutrition, and public outreach. </p>
<h1>Why We Need You</h1>
<p>Peace Love Plates has been operating with only three executive officers performing all operations in their personal free time. With the help of full-time employees to develop our program, materials, and execute business plan milestones, we look to effectively achieve our mission on a much larger scale within a much shorter period of time. One-third of all premature deaths are from diet-related diseases, and by providing these free cooking and nutrition classes we can reduce that number drastically!</p>
<p>Although progress has been made, Peace Love Plates has reached the point where it needs a highly skilled and passionate employee, working full-time, to take the organization to the next level. Without this full-time employee, Peace Love Plates will continue to move forward at an incredibly slow rate. It is in our best interest to entrust the progression and development to someone spending each and every day developing our organization and creating influential networks within our local community. </p>
<h1>In Summary</h1>
<p>Peace Love Plates, as a public benefit organization, owes it to their community to provide their life-changing classes on a more frequent schedule. Without someone working full-time, this cannot happen.</p>
<p>Join us in sharing the wonderful world of healthy cooking on a budget as we provide our free hands on cooking and nutrition classes to the community of Los Angeles and hopefully, in time, throughout the United States.</p>
<h1>What Happens if We Don't Reach Our Goals?</h1>
<div>That would be a bummer, but every little bit helps and we need any help you can provide! Even if we raise just $1,000, that would allow us to provide 10-15 free classes and impact the lives of 100-250 people! Each class requires approximately 20 hours of labor and between $50-$100 depending on the varying ingredients in each recipe.</div>
<h1>I Want to Help, but I Don't Have Money!</h1><div>Oh boy, do we still need you! You can still play a fundamental role in Peace Love Plates' mission by sharing the link to our campaign on your Facebook Wall, Twitter Timeline, emailing it to your friends and family, or even volunteering to help with our cooking classes!

I'm here because I'm dedicated to revolutionizing education. I've worked with children and their families for over 20 years in a public school, corporate care, private schools, as a camp counselor, parent educator, and as a private nanny. I searched to find a program that brought children to the forefront, while providing clear boundaries for mutual respect, where children would be seen and heard and where adults would see with new eyes and listen for what was unsaid. Homeschool Garden is based on those values and we have developed a school model that provides an environment where children, families, and teachers can thrive and grow together on the foundation of mutual respect.

What has been created is 
A community of families and friendships that are long lasting even years after the families have graduated from the school program
A growing organic garden, that is harvested for our nutritious organic meals. Wholesome food that is cooked on site and provided for all the children and faculty
Small individualized group care for children during their foundational years 
Support for families through workshops, parent conferences, and community for the child’s developing transitions is all inclusive
This campaign is to bring Homeschool Garden's model to more families and provide an opportunity for more children to grow organically *Provide for our non profit application process*Sustain the current program offerings: including scholarships to families, multi-language offerings, and specialty teachers*Allow for growth as we transition and reach out to further spread the model and revolutionize the education status quo What I've witnessed over the years is the strength in the community. Children at school are like family, when you create the environment for it. They support, interact, and engage, it's what they observe from each other, the faculty, and their families.  How many lives do you want to touch with your donation? We want to bring this kind of education revolution to more children and what we've seen is families transformed, communities developed, and a big desire to spread the word
We are raising the proverbial roof and need the tools to play BIGGER and HARDER than ever before 
AND we've got some special and ONE OF A KIND perks for your generous donations

<p></p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: normal;""></h3>
<p>Africa's image in the media is not very encouraging. It makes you feel as if all is lost with no glimpse of hope on the continent. </p>
<p>I have found that to be a big FALSE. There is a new generation of African's who are pushing the boundaries.</p></span>
</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I’m Musah, a young graduate from the University of Ghana and very passionate about Africa. I started a news magazine website this year aimed at telling the African success stories.    <a href=""http://www.risingafrica.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.RisingAfrica.org</a></span></p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: normal;""></h3>
<p>I believe we ought to change the narrative about Africa. <b>It’s time we tell our own story.</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>Africa is Rising</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Africa
have had her fair share of challenges but despite going through so much, this generation still keeps the hope of
a prosperous Africa alive for the unborn, against all odds.
This generation is full of achievers, while some are household names;
others are unsung or totally unknown. All these achievers are ordinary men and
women who have risen above these challenges and are making impact and showing
future promises at the same time.</p>
<p>At
Rising Africa we seek to tell these inspiring success stories so as to
generate and encourage the ‘CAN DO and believe in yourselves’ attitude in
others and also give some publicity to these achievers and their efforts.</p>
<p>Our
stories cover Africans at all age levels and in every sector of the economy - Our
<u></u><a href=""http://www.risingafrica.org/category/success-stories/wonder-kids/%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wonder Kids </a>section covers Africans from age 7 to 12, <u><a href=""http://www.risingafrica.org/category/success-stories/super-teens/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Super Teens</a></u>

<p><br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Rising Africa is more than a website</h3> <p></p>
<p>Rising Africa is more than just a website, it’s a cause we
are championing to populate the media space (print, online, TV and radio) with
these great stories. Starting from Ghana (host country) we will grow to all the
African countries by forming strategic partnerships with various youth groups on
the continent. We will be doing the following all aimed at spreading these
stories and also building capacity to enable many more to rise -  </p>
<p><b>·</b><span> 
</span>Radio and TV programs </p>
<p><b>·</b><span> 
</span>Create short inspirational and capacity building videos
and audios to be made viral on social media.</p>
<p><b>·</b><span> 
</span>Seminars, workshops and Conferences </p>
<p><b>·</b><span> 
</span>Create monthly newsletters / magazines (print and online)
of great African stories and capacity building articles. </p>
<p><b>·</b><span> 
</span>Build a network of progressive and forward thinking
African’s called the Rising African Network (RAN Africa) in all African
countries and for African’s in the diaspora. </p>
<p><b>·</b><span> 
</span>Inspire innovation and entrepreneurship in Africa through</p>
<p>1.<span>  </span>Creating an online crowdfunding portal to provide funding opportunity for
great African ideas</p>
<p>2.<span>  </span>Start an incubator to nurture and grow startups. </p>
<p><b>·</b><span> 
</span>We plan to go into documentaries and movies as well all
aimed at telling these success stories.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<div>
<h3>We need your support</h3>
<p></p>
<p>With your support we will do the following as part of our
core mandate of telling the African Success Story.</p>
<p>1. 
Increase our hosting capacity for the website to
be able to accommodate higher traffic. </p>
<p>2. 
Build a mobile app (all platforms) for the work.
</p>
<p>3. 
Start online ad campaign to reach more people. </p>
<p>4. 
Start our print magazine/newsletters with these great
stories for non-online readers. </p>
<p>5. 
Start our weekly radio program on the two major
tertiary university campuses in Ghana (University of Ghana and Kwame Nkrumah
University of Science and technology)</p>
<p>6. 
Purchase cameras and other equipment to help us in the creation of inspiring videos for our YouTube channel and hopefully for TV.</p>
<br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>As we share these stories, articles and videos,
we seek to inspire and equip others to rise. People will also be inspired to pick
up great entrepreneurial / business ideas they can start in their various
countries / towns from the website. Another key impact is the positive
publicity this campaign will be giving to all these new ideas and startups
springing up.</p>
<p>I believe this can go a long way
to restrain our youth from dangerous ‘greener pastures’ journey to Europe and
the America’s. Because now there will be self believe.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>The road
ahead will not be easy and sometimes will prove impossible. We’ve had times we
felt like giving up on this project but like everyone else, the stories we tell inspires us to carry on. We are the number
one beneficiaries of our work. We
are young and restless and above all we believe in Africa, so we will work hard
to see Africa rising no matter what. </p>

</div></div>","The Problem


Africa's image in the media is not very encouraging. It makes you feel as if all is lost with no glimpse of hope on the continent. 
I have found that to be a big FALSE. There is a new generation of African's who are pushing the boundaries.

I’m Musah, a young graduate from the University of Ghana and very passionate about Africa. I started a news magazine website this year aimed at telling the African success stories.    www.RisingAfrica.org

I believe we ought to change the narrative about Africa. It’s time we tell our own story.



Africa is Rising

Africa
have had her fair share of challenges but despite going through so much, this generation still keeps the hope of
a prosperous Africa alive for the unborn, against all odds.
This generation is full of achievers, while some are household names;
others are unsung or totally unknown. All these achievers are ordinary men and
women who have risen above these challenges and are making impact and showing
future promises at the same time.
At
Rising Africa we seek to tell these inspiring success stories so as to
generate and encourage the ‘CAN DO and believe in yourselves’ attitude in
others and also give some publicity to these achievers and their efforts.
Our
stories cover Africans at all age levels and in every sector of the economy - Our
Wonder Kids section covers Africans from age 7 to 12, Super Teens
section between age 13 to 19 years old and Young Achievers from 20 to 30 years
old. We also have a special
section for WOMEN in Africa and working on another section for the
disable.

   Rising Africa is more than a website 
Rising Africa is more than just a website, it’s a cause we
are championing to populate the media space (print, online, TV and radio) with
these great stories. Starting from Ghana (host country) we will grow to all the
African countries by forming strategic partnerships with various youth groups on
the continent. We will be doing the following all aimed at spreading these
stories and also building capacity to enable many more to rise -  
· 
Radio and TV programs 
· 
Create short inspirational and capacity building videos
and audios to be made viral on social media.
· 
Seminars, workshops and Conferences 
· 
Create monthly newsletters / magazines (print and online)
of great African stories and capacity building articles. 
· 
Build a network of progressive and forward thinking
African’s called the Rising African Network (RAN Africa) in all African
countries and for African’s in the diaspora. 
· 
Inspire innovation and entrepreneurship in Africa through
1.  Creating an online crowdfunding portal to provide funding opportunity for
great African ideas
2.  Start an incubator to nurture and grow startups. 
· 
We plan to go into documentaries and movies as well all
aimed at telling these success stories.


We need your support

With your support we will do the following as part of our
core mandate of telling the African Success Story.
1. 
Increase our hosting capacity for the website to
be able to accommodate higher traffic. 
2. 
Build a mobile app (all platforms) for the work.

3. 
Start online ad campaign to reach more people. 
4. 
Start our print magazine/newsletters with these great
stories for non-online readers. 
5. 
Start our weekly radio program on the two major
tertiary university campuses in Ghana (University of Ghana and Kwame Nkrumah
University of Science and technology)
6. 
Purchase cameras and other equipment to help us in the creation of inspiring videos for our YouTube channel and hopefully for TV.

   The Impact 
As we share these stories, articles and videos,
we seek to inspire and equip others to rise. People will also be inspired to pick
up great entrepreneurial / business ideas they can start in their various
countries / towns from the website. Another key impact is the positive
publicity this campaign will be giving to all these new ideas and startups
springing up.
I believe this can go a long way
to restrain our youth from dangerous ‘greener pastures’ journey to Europe and
the America’s. Because now there will be self believe.
   Challenges  
The road
ahead will not be easy and sometimes will prove impossible. We’ve had times we
felt like giving up on this project but like everyone else, the stories we tell inspires us to carry on. We are the number
one beneficiaries of our work. We
are young and restless and above all we believe in Africa, so we will work hard
to see Africa rising no matter what. 

   Other Ways You Can Help 
We definitely need money to make this happen, but even if you can't donate there are several other ways to help:
1. You can start by joining our team. Whether you are an individual or organization, there is always something for you to do. You can 
      (a) write for us - success stories, inspirational and capacity building articles /                     videos
      (b) Be a social media champion - Share our stories on Facebook, Twitter and                       other social media platforms
       (c) Join our network of rising Africans (RAN Africa - Rising African Network) -                      RAN Africa will launch in December. Do check our website for more                                      information. You can apply to be a member as well as become a curator to                    organize RAN events in your town / country.

2. We are seeking to start a studio and thus we will appreciate
those who can support us in that way. Help can range from professional advice, training
and even some media equipment we will need. Send us a note here. 




It’s an exciting journey ahead as we hope to play a key role in a new Africa. 
                            Let’s work together to achieve greatness.

<p>Promoting Global Learning (PGL) is a UK charity (Registration Number: 1158202) established
in 2014, by Sue Gerrish and Henry Yentumi, with a vision to raise the standard
of education in Africa. Following several visits to Africa, Sue and Henry realised
the challenges African children face to learn and they became passionate about transforming their life chances. In England, children are very fortunate to have an abundance
of books and to be surrounded by stimulating, colourful and well-resourced schools
and classrooms. In Africa the situation is quite the opposite:</p>

opportunity to attend school and learn basic skills.</span></li></ul>

<ul><li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">More than 90% of African children who attend school have never owned a
book of their own.</span></li></ul>
<ul><li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Teachers use a
‘chalk-and-talk’ method of teaching a class of up to 60 pupils. This is a valid
teaching method but only 78% of schools have blackboards and less than 50% of schools
have chalk.</span></li></ul>
<div>
<p>Within a few months of setting up, PGL had filled a garage with old
textbooks, story books, stationery and laptops kindly donated by schools in the UK.
Now they have collected more than 500,000 essential books from over 500 schools
and individuals across UK, which are ready to be shipped to Africa. PGL's next
goal is to ship a container of 100,000 books to pupils in nursery and
primary schools in Ghana and to set up 3 mobile libraries in communities which
have limited access to books or lack the funds to build a permanent library.</p>

Promoting Global Learning (PGL) is a UK charity (Registration Number: 1158202) established
in 2014, by Sue Gerrish and Henry Yentumi, with a vision to raise the standard
of education in Africa. Following several visits to Africa, Sue and Henry realised
the challenges African children face to learn and they became passionate about transforming their life chances. In England, children are very fortunate to have an abundance
of books and to be surrounded by stimulating, colourful and well-resourced schools
and classrooms. In Africa the situation is quite the opposite:



Of Africa's nearly 128 million school-aged children, only half have the
opportunity to attend school and learn basic skills.
An estimated 37 million African children learn so little while in school
that they are hardly better off than peers who never went to school.
More than 90% of African children who attend school have never owned a
book of their own.
Teachers use a
‘chalk-and-talk’ method of teaching a class of up to 60 pupils. This is a valid
teaching method but only 78% of schools have blackboards and less than 50% of schools
have chalk.

Within a few months of setting up, PGL had filled a garage with old
textbooks, story books, stationery and laptops kindly donated by schools in the UK.
Now they have collected more than 500,000 essential books from over 500 schools
and individuals across UK, which are ready to be shipped to Africa. PGL's next
goal is to ship a container of 100,000 books to pupils in nursery and
primary schools in Ghana and to set up 3 mobile libraries in communities which
have limited access to books or lack the funds to build a permanent library.



Help us to set up three Mobile Libraries for children of the Upper West Akim District in Ghana


We are getting ready to ship more than 100,000 books to Ghana
and to distribute our educational materials through 3 mobile library vehicles.
These libraries will provide services to disadvantaged schools in the Upper
West Akim District of Ghana and aim to ignite a passion for learning, reading and
exploring among local children.





Upper West Akim District
is located in Eastern region of Ghana and has a total population of 97,950. 


65% of the working population is engaged in agriculture and their income
levels are extremely low.


There are 167 public
schools available at the basic level. The total number of students at school is 19,811 with approximately 15,000 students in nursery and primary schools.


13
primary schools are operating under trees; and a further 10 primary schools and 8 junior high
schools have no permanent classroom blocks.


The
pass rate for Maths is 27% and for English is 22%, 11 schools have a zero percent (0%) pass rate. 









To make this happen, we need to raise £60,000




Your contribution will make an enormous difference in the
lives of thousands of children in Ghana. The fund will be used for:




Shipping: £3,000 - Shipping a
container of 100,000 books from UK to Ghana.


Mobile Library Vehicles: £34,000 - Purchasing 3 second-hand
Transit type vans in good condition: each costs around £11,300.


Interior Design: £4,800 - Designing, shelving and colouring  expenses to decorate the vans and turn them into to 3 efficient and friendly
mobile libraries.


Annual Staff Salary: £3,200 - Hiring 3 drivers and 3 librarians.


Staff Training: £1,500 - Organising training for our staff and
volunteers. We plan to engage 2 volunteers per community.


Annual Fuel Cost: £5,400 -  Average monthly
fuel expense per vehicle is around £150.


Repair & Maintenance: £2,100 - Average annual repair & maintenance cost of
£700 per vehicle.


Annual Insurance: £1,000 - Insuring 3 mobile library vans.


Annual Storage & Garage: £5,000 - Renting a
storage unit for books and a garage for the mobile library vans.


If you help us to meet our goal, your kindness will not
go unnoticed or unrewarded. Please check out the right rail for the packages of authentic African perks you could receive as a way of saying thank you for your vital contribution.

The Impact




We are inspired by the words of Kofi Annan,“knowledge is power. Information is liberating. Education is the premise of
progress, in every society, in every family."" 
Imagine a
world where children must learn to read without books.
Imagine a classroom where over 60 children are studying from a few copies of
old, uninspiring textbooks. Sadly, this is the reality in many schools in Africa. 
Through your
help, we are able to provide a well-resourced and inspiring learning
environment by organising reading clubs and introducing a library concept to thousands of vulnerable children
in deprived rural communities. Together, let’s transform the life of many children in
2016.


    
Your contribution will give hope and opportunity to many
children in Africa. We promise to keep you posted regularly on how your generosity has transformed the lives of the children.Thank you.

<p>Je m'appelle Rabelais Marius Nkounawa. </p>
<p>Je suis étudiant camerounais, titulaire d'un Master en sciences de la population et du développement, et je suis actuellement en thèse de doctorat à l'Université Catholique de Louvain en Belgique sous la direction du Professeur Philippe De Leener, appuyé par Philippe Bocquier, Bernard Fusulier et Felix Metchuyie. </p>
<p>La rareté des bourses dans le domaine des sciences sociales fait que je suis obligé de faire des jobs d'étudiants pour subvenir à mes besoins. Mais dans cette étape de la recherche, la nécessité d'un budget conséquent fait que je me tourne vers vous pour solliciter un mode participatif de financement de mes recherches de terrain au Cameroun. </p>

<br/>
<h3>Mais de quoi je veux vous parler concrètement ? </h3>
<p></p>
<p>Je fais un doctorat en Etudes du Développement sur la relance de l'agriculture familiale en Afrique en général et au Cameroun en particulier. Tout part d'un constat, qui est qu'aujourd'hui la situation socio démographique et économique de l’Afrique démontre que l'agriculture familiale est la plus pratiquée, et qu'elle seule au contraire de l'agro business peut apporter les solutions aux problèmes de l'emploi du chômage et de la protection de l'environnement, tant en milieu rural qu'en milieu urbain. </p>
<p>Je part de ce constat logique que si les sociétés africaines aujourd'hui sont en proie à des changements, lesquels changements commencent par la plus petite entité sociale qui est la famille. Dans cette logique, les modes de productions de ces familles pour la plupart agropastorales changent aussi, en ce que l'unité de reproduction biologique est en même temps l'unité de production économique. </p>
<p>Seulement, presque aucune des politiques publiques mises sur pieds tant au niveau local, national, régional ou même dicté par les institutions internationales ne prend en compte cette donne. On peut comprendre pourquoi autant de politiques sont autant d'échecs! </p>
<p></p>
<h3>   Quels sont les impacts sociétaux de ce projet? </h3>
<p></p>
<p>Je me dis donc que pour comprendre la construction et la persistance des freins à l'agriculture familiale en Afrique, il faut interroger au préalable ces mécanismes fondamentaux relatifs aux changements à la fois structurels et fonctionnalistes de la famille. </p>
<p>Alors sans doute que des politiques mieux adaptées, mieux ciblées seront proposées aux agriculteurs. Alors sans doute que la relance de l'agriculture en Afrique et au Cameroun seront enfin des réalités, et permettront l'amélioration des conditions de vie des agriculteurs et une source d'espoir pour cette jeunesse africaine de plus en plus nombreuse, de plus en plus déboussolée, et dont on a l'impression que le rêve ultime dans fort bien de cas se résume dans cette impression, dans ce sentiment illusoire que l'avenir se trouve ailleurs !</p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Où se déroulera la recherche de terrain proprement dite? </h3>
<div>La recherche de terrain se déroulera au Cameroun, dans la région de l'Ouest, en pays Bamiléké, sur une période de trois mois, de janvier 2016 à mars 2016. Longtemps considérée comme ""le grenier du Cameroun"" et dans une large mesure de l'Afrique centrale, cette région est aujourd'hui en proie à un taux d'exode supérieur à toutes les autres du pays. Et la question dont de savoir qu'est ce qui se passe fondamentalement dans ces sociétés pour que le mouvement des populations soit contraire à celui de tous les discours politiques qui considèrent l'agriculture comme le moteur du développement du pays? A notre sens, les arguments de pénibilité, de rentabilité, sont relativement éculés, tant les métiers alternatifs à l'agriculture ne dérogent aucunement aux causes généralement évoquées pour l'abandon de l’agriculture. </div>

for these families, most of which are farming families, are changing, in that the biological reproduicing unit is at the same time the unit of economic production. <div style=""text-align: center;"">

Je m'appelle Rabelais Marius Nkounawa. 
Je suis étudiant camerounais, titulaire d'un Master en sciences de la population et du développement, et je suis actuellement en thèse de doctorat à l'Université Catholique de Louvain en Belgique sous la direction du Professeur Philippe De Leener, appuyé par Philippe Bocquier, Bernard Fusulier et Felix Metchuyie. 
La rareté des bourses dans le domaine des sciences sociales fait que je suis obligé de faire des jobs d'étudiants pour subvenir à mes besoins. Mais dans cette étape de la recherche, la nécessité d'un budget conséquent fait que je me tourne vers vous pour solliciter un mode participatif de financement de mes recherches de terrain au Cameroun. 





Mais de quoi je veux vous parler concrètement ? 

Je fais un doctorat en Etudes du Développement sur la relance de l'agriculture familiale en Afrique en général et au Cameroun en particulier. Tout part d'un constat, qui est qu'aujourd'hui la situation socio démographique et économique de l’Afrique démontre que l'agriculture familiale est la plus pratiquée, et qu'elle seule au contraire de l'agro business peut apporter les solutions aux problèmes de l'emploi du chômage et de la protection de l'environnement, tant en milieu rural qu'en milieu urbain. 
Je part de ce constat logique que si les sociétés africaines aujourd'hui sont en proie à des changements, lesquels changements commencent par la plus petite entité sociale qui est la famille. Dans cette logique, les modes de productions de ces familles pour la plupart agropastorales changent aussi, en ce que l'unité de reproduction biologique est en même temps l'unité de production économique. 
Seulement, presque aucune des politiques publiques mises sur pieds tant au niveau local, national, régional ou même dicté par les institutions internationales ne prend en compte cette donne. On peut comprendre pourquoi autant de politiques sont autant d'échecs! 

   Quels sont les impacts sociétaux de ce projet? 

Je me dis donc que pour comprendre la construction et la persistance des freins à l'agriculture familiale en Afrique, il faut interroger au préalable ces mécanismes fondamentaux relatifs aux changements à la fois structurels et fonctionnalistes de la famille. 
Alors sans doute que des politiques mieux adaptées, mieux ciblées seront proposées aux agriculteurs. Alors sans doute que la relance de l'agriculture en Afrique et au Cameroun seront enfin des réalités, et permettront l'amélioration des conditions de vie des agriculteurs et une source d'espoir pour cette jeunesse africaine de plus en plus nombreuse, de plus en plus déboussolée, et dont on a l'impression que le rêve ultime dans fort bien de cas se résume dans cette impression, dans ce sentiment illusoire que l'avenir se trouve ailleurs !

Où se déroulera la recherche de terrain proprement dite? 
La recherche de terrain se déroulera au Cameroun, dans la région de l'Ouest, en pays Bamiléké, sur une période de trois mois, de janvier 2016 à mars 2016. Longtemps considérée comme ""le grenier du Cameroun"" et dans une large mesure de l'Afrique centrale, cette région est aujourd'hui en proie à un taux d'exode supérieur à toutes les autres du pays. Et la question dont de savoir qu'est ce qui se passe fondamentalement dans ces sociétés pour que le mouvement des populations soit contraire à celui de tous les discours politiques qui considèrent l'agriculture comme le moteur du développement du pays? A notre sens, les arguments de pénibilité, de rentabilité, sont relativement éculés, tant les métiers alternatifs à l'agriculture ne dérogent aucunement aux causes généralement évoquées pour l'abandon de l’agriculture. 





Alors que j'essaye de comprendre les freins à l'expansion agricole en Afrique, j'en ai moi même, des freins! Vous connaissez le nerf de la guerre... 



Pour la réalisation de cette recherche sur le terrain au Cameroun, j'ai besoin d'un montant de 5000$ réparti comme suit
- Voyage aller/retour: 1000$
- Frais de séjour: logement, nutrition, santé: 583$/3 pendant trois mois.
- Dépenses liées à la recherche proprement dite : transport, matériel de collecte et d'analyse des données, rémunérations des accompagnateurs, frais de communication avec les encadreurs en Belgique et au Cameroun: 583$/mois pendant trois mois. 
- Dépenses diverses et frais d'hébergement du présent appel par Indiegogo: 500$. 








Comment contribuer et qu'est ce que vous obtenez en retour de votre participation? Les suggestions de contributions sont les suivantes et correspondent chacune à un plat traditionnel Camerounais, pour rester un peu dans le thème de la recherche :) Les récompenses pour les contributions sont décrites dans la rubrique Contreparties.

Merci de tout coeur !Who am I?My name is
Rabelais Marius Nkounawa.
I am a
Cameroonian student with a Master’s degree in Population and Development
Studies, and I am currently working on a doctoral thesis at the Université
catholique de Louvain in Belgium.
Due to the scarcity of funding for research in the social sciences, I have to work
student jobs to support myself financially. However, at this stage in my research,
I need more substantial financial support, which is why I am asking for your participation
in financing my field research in Cameroon.                              But what am I talking about exactly?I am doing a
PhD in Development Studies on the topic of reviving family farming in Africa in
general and Cameroon in particular. My research is inspired by the observation
that, in Africa’s current demographic and socio-economic situation, family
farming alone – not agribusiness – has the potential to address unemployment
and environmental protection issues in both rural and urban settings. 
My logic is that changes in African societies
today begin in the smallest social unit: the family. The modes of production
for these families, most of which are farming families, are changing, in that the biological reproduicing unit is at the same time the unit of economic production. 

But almost none
of the public policies set up at the local, national, or regional level or even
dictated by international institutions take these changes into account. It’s
easy to see why so many policies fail!



Where will the research take place?

My field research will take place in Cameroon in the western region of Bamiléké
over a period of three months, from January 2016 to March 2016. Long considered
""the breadbasket of Cameroon"" and to a large extent Central Africa,
this region is now experiencing a higher rate of exodus than any other region
in the country. The aim of my research is to explore why such movement in
population is occurring, despite all of the political discourse promoting
agriculture as the country’s engine of development. This exodus cannot simply be
attributed to perceptions among Cameroonians that farming is unprofitable and laborious;
in reality, the alternative to farming is no more profitable and no less
strenuous than farming itself. 




Just as I am trying to understand the barriers to
agricultural expansion in Africa, I myself am confronted by barriers! 

For the
realization of this field research in Cameroon, I need a total of $ 5,000,
allocated as follows:
- Roundtrip travel: $ 1000
- Living expenses: housing, food, health: $ 583/3 for three months.

collection and analysis,  various remunerations,

That is why, pressed again by the adverse financial conditions, we, the astronomers of the Institute of Astronomy and National Astronomical Observatory – Rozhen, as well as of the other astronomical centres in Bulgaria, are forced to address all who are concerned that NAO proceeds to fulfil its mission as a research and education centre. Yes, it concerns the equipment of the NATIONAL Astronomical Observatory and NOT the scientists themselves.
  
    Other Ways You Can Help 
All donations (regardless of their size) that would be credited to Rozhen NAO will be used SOLELY for the Observatory. These are resources necessary for the operation of the telescopes and for the purchase of imminent supplies for the scientific equipment. Each year an individual report on the funds received and their detailed expenditure will be worked out. The report will remain public and everyone will be able to access it on the website of NAO – www.nao-rozhen.orgDonations to the Rozhen National Astronomical Observatory are welcome to the followingBank account:Societe Generale Expressbank56 Bulgaria Blvd., 4700 Smolyan, BulgariaIBAN: BG94TTBB94003120017759;  BIC: TTBBBG22Institute of Astronomy, NAO-RozhenSincerely Yours:Prof. Dr. Tanyu Bonev,Director of IA and NAO",0.0,2,"1 Campaign
