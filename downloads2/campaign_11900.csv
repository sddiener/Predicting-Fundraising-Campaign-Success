<div>For the last 9 months, I have been in deep collaboration with a brilliant graphic artist, Alison Klepatsky. I saw her sketching at a party, we began to talk about art, and before I knew it, she was sending me images from our conversation that blew me away. Each time Alison draws piece of my story I feel a beautiful ache and a knowing that Holy Roller is becoming real because of her acute vision.</div>
<div>Holy Roller is a memoir of my life growing up in the Bible Belt of Dallas Texas.

For the last 9 months, I have been in deep collaboration with a brilliant graphic artist, Alison Klepatsky. I saw her sketching at a party, we began to talk about art, and before I knew it, she was sending me images from our conversation that blew me away. Each time Alison draws piece of my story I feel a beautiful ache and a knowing that Holy Roller is becoming real because of her acute vision.

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Establishing comedy as a part of a truly great Cleveland experience is 
the ambition. Laughter is the goal. Also, probably sandwiches. The Accidental Comedy Fest and other Accidental productions have helped Cleveland establish itself as an emerging comedy scene. Comedy is an art form that helps bring the community together, similar to sports without all of the sweating and sadness. There's still probably some sadness, but it's witty. <br/></p>
<p>Over the years, performers who have come to Cleveland have left with a completely different impression and narrative for the city than before they came.  That is a powerful thing. Entering the 5th year of this endeavor, approaching over 100 alumni that left feeling great about Cleveland. Many of whom are becoming movers and shakers in their respective scenes. <br/></p>
<p>The goal through ACF and other Accidental Comedy productions is to continue proving Cleveland is a relevant location for stand up comedy, and to connect comedy with the narrative and experience of Cleveland in a similar way that Second City is ingrained in the Chicago experience.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>If this campaign does not hit it's goal, the outcome could be devastating:<br/>-Jimmie Graham will begin to slowly transition to Slam Poetry<br/>-Brian Kenny will stop trying to control his diabetes and could probably lose a foot<br/>-Mary Santora will immediately become a mother<br/>-John Bruton will spearhead the reformation of the WNBA team Cleveland Rockers<br/>-Ramon Rivas will burn all of his Cleveland related t-shirts, forcing him to roam the streets naked and afraid.<br/>-Comics who plan on coming to Cleveland will think we are weak and non-fun<br/>

You will fall in love with the wanna-be romantic Raj and the big hearted clutz Vimal, you will laugh and cry at the antics of the other survivors stuck in the corner store only days before the Earths inevitable fall to a Vampire plague.
Richard Taylor (Weta Studios) had this to say about my previous graphic novel 'Deadman's Land' ""An inventive, blood-soaked horror show; begging to be made into a live action film"" ~ Sir Richard Taylor

<p><i><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Now you can preview the story of Maccabaeus and see for yourself how awesome it is. <a href=""http://goo.gl/psSRhq"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Read the first chapter here.</a><br/><br/>Also, scroll down to see all new original Maccabaeus character art. A new hero (or villain) is being added for each day of Chanukah, so keep coming back, and <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/maccabaeus"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">follow us on Facebook</a>!</i><br/> </p>
<h3>Chanukah — The Festival of Light</h3>
<p>It's one of the best known Jewish holidays, and yet, one of the least understood. (We can't even all agree on how to spell it! Hanakah? Chanukah? Channukka?!) Maccabæus, an epic retelling of the Hasmonean Revolt, will change all that. Within its pages, you will find an incredible true story of palace intrigue and holy war, of oppression, defiance, faith, and ultimately redemption.<br/><br/><strong>Meet the Maccabees</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480841074/dkgdqsfndoaqsj3jrtkc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><p>Mattathias son of John is the head of the noble House of Asmoneus, and a descendant of the Biblical Aaron, brother of Moses. He and his sons are <i>kohanim</i> (priests), spiritual leaders whose role in Ancient Israel revolved around the Temple in Jerusalem, which represented the very heart and soul of Jewish life.</p><p>Standing at the crossroads of Europe, Africa, and Asia, the Land of Israel was conquered and reconquered time and again over the centuries. In the days of the Maccabees, Judea had just fallen under the dominion of the Seleucids, the Syrian-Greek Empire. While the Greeks were usually magnanimous towards the nations they conquered and tolerant of their religions and customs, the Israelites, with their unwavering faith in a singular, incorporeal God, were an exception.  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480876336/scqfyo3h9dtxjfqazmfi.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>Under the Seleucid occupation, idols were erected throughout the land, and practices central to Jewish spirituality (e.g. keeping the Sabbath, studying the Torah, and the covenant of circumcision) were outlawed on pain of death. As this artist's rendering of events illustrates, Mattathias didn't take the news very well.</p><p>In a brazen act of defiance, Mattathias struck down a Greek envoy and a Jewish collaborator by the sword, and sparked an uprising that, under the leadership of his sons, particularly Yehudah, the Judas Maccabaeus of legend, led to the liberation of Jerusalem, the miraculous re-dedication of the Temple (of which Chanukah is a celebration), and the restoration of Jewish sovereignty in their homeland.</p><h2>
<br/>About Me</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480846549/ixedodmvlltbozix2jrh.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>Hi there! My name is Daniel, and I'm a freelance writer from Brooklyn with a B.A. in Middle Eastern history. Once upon a time, I was editor of a local newspaper called the <a href=""http://www.jewishvoiceny.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jewish Voice</a>, and since that time my work, which includes op-eds, hard news, and occasionally fun stuff like <a href=""http://www.aish.com/j/as/From-Jediism-to-Judaism-Star-Wars-as-Jewish-Allegory.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this article on Aish HaTorah about the hidden Jewish elements of the Star Wars universe,</a> has appeared in dozens of newspapers, magazines, and online media in both in the U.S. and Israel.</p><p>Project Maccabaeus was originally conceived as a blockbuster action movie, and it currently exists in the form of a screenplay. Fun fact: If you don't have connections in the film industry and/or millions of dollars, it is difficult bordering on impossible to get a movie made. Undaunted by reality (Maccabæus is the story of a miracle, after all), I began showing my spec script to colleagues and friends, and I kept hearing the same thing: This would be a <i>crazy awesome</i> graphic novel. It didn't take long for me to realize how right they were. I mean, just look at that battle scene up top. Is that not the most badass thing you've ever seen? And how many of today's great action films (like ""300,"" or as I call it, ""Spartan Maccabæus"") started out as graphic novels? That said, even if the story of the Maccabees never makes it to the big screen (or even worse, if it makes it to the big screen and is produced and directed by Mel Gibson), this is a book that deserves to be made. If nothing else, it'll make for the coolest Chanukah gift ever. But it is also my hope that the story will serve as a source of inspiration, especially to Jewish youngsters out there who are made to feel ashamed of who they are and where they come from. It really is one of our people's most fascinating, controversial, and exciting stories--and considering we're the same people who gave the world <strong>The Bible</strong>, that's really saying something!</p><p>This is our second attempt to fund Project Maccabæus, which is why the video says coming Chanukah 2016. (We were featured in the Jewish Press last year, the first time around. <a href=""http://www.jewishpress.com/sections/features/sword-and-sandal-and-tzitzis/2015/12/24/0/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Check it out</a> and learn more about the project!)  If we raise the necessary funds this time, the book will be ready in time for Chanukah of next year. A year ago on Kickstarter (you can see the original campaign <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1224338585/maccabaeus"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>) we raised nearly half of what we needed in pledges. But since Kickstarter is all or nothing, we received nothing. That kind of uncompromising attitude is good when you're waging a guerilla war for freedom like the Maccabees did. For getting a book made? Not so much. So this time around, we're leaving our options open.</p><p>If we reach our goal of $10,000, we'll be able to complete revisions to the script, produce the necessary artwork, and produce a limited edition printing of the graphic novel. If we get halfway there ($5,000), I'll be able to commission Maccabæus as an e-book. Even if we don't reach either goal, we'll still be able to promote the project, entering the script into creative writing competitions, marketing it to publishers and so on. Second fun fact: An earlier draft of Maccabæus made the <a href=""http://www.moviebytes.com/ContestDetail.cfm?StoryID=5022&amp;ContestNumber=2935&amp;Tab=tab3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">quarterfinals of the 2015 Courier Awards</a>. So I've got that going for me, which is nice.<br/><br/>And hey, you never know. Project Maccabæus could go viral this time around and raise millions. If it does, we'll publish the book and start working on the film. (I can dream, can't I?)<br/><br/>Bottom line: Anything you contribute to Project Maccabæus can and will be used to move the story forward. And the more we put into it as a community, the more we'll all get out of it. At the very least, you can be guaranteed a copy of the original screenplay--which will no doubt become a collector's item once Maccabæus the Motion Picture sweeps the 2021 Oscars. And if we achieve our funding goals, you can have your own copy of the greatest Jewish graphic novel yet to be made, all in time for next Chanukah.<br/><br/><strong>*Note regarding the perks:</strong> To be 100% clear, only items that are guaranteed at the moment are the original screenplay and the commentary. The Maccabæus graphic novel e-book is contingent on us raising enough funds to commission the artwork, roughly $5,000, or 50% of our campaign goal. To actually publish a limited run of the book in hardcopy, we have to meet or exceed our $10,000 goal. If we raise just shy of 50%, or somewhere between 50 and 100%, we'll work out some sort of ""consolation prize"" for our backers, like signed prints, or possibly commissioning a smaller collection of Maccabee artwork to accompany the script. Also, all contributors entitled to receive copies of the screenplay will receive them, with God's help, within a few weeks of the end of the campaign. All the perks with estimated delivery dates of December 2017, that's just referring to the graphic novel itself.<br/><br/>So please, join us, and just as importantly, tell <strong>everyone</strong>!<br/><br/><i>PS: Special thanks to our friend and gentleman poet Joseph Robbins, for producing and narrating the Maccabæus trailer video.

Chanukah — The Festival of Light
It's one of the best known Jewish holidays, and yet, one of the least understood. (We can't even all agree on how to spell it! Hanakah? Chanukah? Channukka?!) Maccabæus, an epic retelling of the Hasmonean Revolt, will change all that. Within its pages, you will find an incredible true story of palace intrigue and holy war, of oppression, defiance, faith, and ultimately redemption.Meet the Maccabees

Mattathias son of John is the head of the noble House of Asmoneus, and a descendant of the Biblical Aaron, brother of Moses. He and his sons are kohanim (priests), spiritual leaders whose role in Ancient Israel revolved around the Temple in Jerusalem, which represented the very heart and soul of Jewish life.Standing at the crossroads of Europe, Africa, and Asia, the Land of Israel was conquered and reconquered time and again over the centuries. In the days of the Maccabees, Judea had just fallen under the dominion of the Seleucids, the Syrian-Greek Empire. While the Greeks were usually magnanimous towards the nations they conquered and tolerant of their religions and customs, the Israelites, with their unwavering faith in a singular, incorporeal God, were an exception.  Under the Seleucid occupation, idols were erected throughout the land, and practices central to Jewish spirituality (e.g. keeping the Sabbath, studying the Torah, and the covenant of circumcision) were outlawed on pain of death. As this artist's rendering of events illustrates, Mattathias didn't take the news very well.In a brazen act of defiance, Mattathias struck down a Greek envoy and a Jewish collaborator by the sword, and sparked an uprising that, under the leadership of his sons, particularly Yehudah, the Judas Maccabaeus of legend, led to the liberation of Jerusalem, the miraculous re-dedication of the Temple (of which Chanukah is a celebration), and the restoration of Jewish sovereignty in their homeland.
About MeHi there! My name is Daniel, and I'm a freelance writer from Brooklyn with a B.A. in Middle Eastern history. Once upon a time, I was editor of a local newspaper called the Jewish Voice, and since that time my work, which includes op-eds, hard news, and occasionally fun stuff like this article on Aish HaTorah about the hidden Jewish elements of the Star Wars universe, has appeared in dozens of newspapers, magazines, and online media in both in the U.S. and Israel.Project Maccabaeus was originally conceived as a blockbuster action movie, and it currently exists in the form of a screenplay. Fun fact: If you don't have connections in the film industry and/or millions of dollars, it is difficult bordering on impossible to get a movie made. Undaunted by reality (Maccabæus is the story of a miracle, after all), I began showing my spec script to colleagues and friends, and I kept hearing the same thing: This would be a crazy awesome graphic novel. It didn't take long for me to realize how right they were. I mean, just look at that battle scene up top. Is that not the most badass thing you've ever seen? And how many of today's great action films (like ""300,"" or as I call it, ""Spartan Maccabæus"") started out as graphic novels? That said, even if the story of the Maccabees never makes it to the big screen (or even worse, if it makes it to the big screen and is produced and directed by Mel Gibson), this is a book that deserves to be made. If nothing else, it'll make for the coolest Chanukah gift ever. But it is also my hope that the story will serve as a source of inspiration, especially to Jewish youngsters out there who are made to feel ashamed of who they are and where they come from. It really is one of our people's most fascinating, controversial, and exciting stories--and considering we're the same people who gave the world The Bible, that's really saying something!This is our second attempt to fund Project Maccabæus, which is why the video says coming Chanukah 2016. (We were featured in the Jewish Press last year, the first time around. Check it out and learn more about the project!)  If we raise the necessary funds this time, the book will be ready in time for Chanukah of next year. A year ago on Kickstarter (you can see the original campaign here) we raised nearly half of what we needed in pledges. But since Kickstarter is all or nothing, we received nothing. That kind of uncompromising attitude is good when you're waging a guerilla war for freedom like the Maccabees did. For getting a book made? Not so much. So this time around, we're leaving our options open.If we reach our goal of $10,000, we'll be able to complete revisions to the script, produce the necessary artwork, and produce a limited edition printing of the graphic novel. If we get halfway there ($5,000), I'll be able to commission Maccabæus as an e-book. Even if we don't reach either goal, we'll still be able to promote the project, entering the script into creative writing competitions, marketing it to publishers and so on. Second fun fact: An earlier draft of Maccabæus made the quarterfinals of the 2015 Courier Awards. So I've got that going for me, which is nice.And hey, you never know. Project Maccabæus could go viral this time around and raise millions. If it does, we'll publish the book and start working on the film. (I can dream, can't I?)Bottom line: Anything you contribute to Project Maccabæus can and will be used to move the story forward. And the more we put into it as a community, the more we'll all get out of it. At the very least, you can be guaranteed a copy of the original screenplay--which will no doubt become a collector's item once Maccabæus the Motion Picture sweeps the 2021 Oscars. And if we achieve our funding goals, you can have your own copy of the greatest Jewish graphic novel yet to be made, all in time for next Chanukah.*Note regarding the perks: To be 100% clear, only items that are guaranteed at the moment are the original screenplay and the commentary. The Maccabæus graphic novel e-book is contingent on us raising enough funds to commission the artwork, roughly $5,000, or 50% of our campaign goal. To actually publish a limited run of the book in hardcopy, we have to meet or exceed our $10,000 goal. If we raise just shy of 50%, or somewhere between 50 and 100%, we'll work out some sort of ""consolation prize"" for our backers, like signed prints, or possibly commissioning a smaller collection of Maccabee artwork to accompany the script. Also, all contributors entitled to receive copies of the screenplay will receive them, with God's help, within a few weeks of the end of the campaign. All the perks with estimated delivery dates of December 2017, that's just referring to the graphic novel itself.So please, join us, and just as importantly, tell everyone!PS: Special thanks to our friend and gentleman poet Joseph Robbins, for producing and narrating the Maccabæus trailer video.

Political and spiritual corruption run rampant throughout the land, with the office of High Priest going to the highest bidder. When the invaders establish an idol in the heart of his hometown, inviting one of his countrymen to bring a sacrificial offering, the kindly old sage snaps. Mattathias' violent outburst against the Syrian-Greek envoy and his Jewish collaborator ignites an insurrection, pitting a ragtag band of Hebrew patriots against the vastly superior imperial army. Emperor Antiochus IV Epiphanes(Ἀντίοχος Δ΄ ὁ Ἐπιφανής)a.k.a.

Milan...</i></p>
<p>
</p><p>A
net of stories, interconnections, transnational meetings where texts
would not be able to tell us its richness and complexity.</p>
<p>For
that reason we decided to experiment another kind of tale, wide and
polimorphic: a mix of ethnographic writing and drawings, pictures,
frames of our experience “in the field”.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What
we tried to do as researchers was to go out from categories, buid by
dominant élites: “migrant”, “refugee”, “clandestin”...</p>
<p>We
want to deconstruct these categories, because we believe that it is
very important in order to understand that we are all humans, beyond
cultural, ethnical and biological differencies.</p>
<p>In
this “<i><b>ethnographicnovel</b></i><span>”
an important focus is about “migrant cosmopolitism”: all the
languages spoken by migrants who never studied in the institutional,
official educational system but learnt the languages in the street.</span></p>
<p><span>We
mostly worked on two cities, </span><b>Milan</b><span>
and </span><b>Berlin</b><span>,
where we found similarities and differences. What is always the same,
is the Lymbus, the eternal waiting and the boredom as part of the
daily life of migrants: the impossibility of working  waiting
for the asylum status, for example, forced to a daily annihilation.</span></p>
<p><span>The
deprivation of possibility of “making” is another aspect we
wanted to highlight: we understood that many of migrant's riot
against the “Fortress Europe”, doesn't ask only for a paper, but
they claim the possibility of acting, “making” in order not to be
stuck for months, years without any possibility of changing their
situation.</span></p>
<p>In
fact, we met many forms of daily resistance, - on a small and wide
scale -, political self-organisation, attempts to speak in “first
person”, to claim rights, to find strategies and paths to get out
of the “Refugee” label and become finally a person.</p>
<p><span>In
this book we don't want to tell just “facts”. For us, it was very
important to share political ideas and discussions about
emancipation, future and imaginary with the women and men that we met
– not forcing them to a frontal interview about the past, the trip
or the tragic experience.</span></p>
<p><span>We
listened, talked, ate, drank, wrote and recorded; shared stories,
worked, walked together, drawn and ask them to draw memories, dreams
and desires.</span></p>
<p><span>We
told each other our life, but most of all we imagined together the
possibility of a better future, a world where the only stranger would
be discrimination and racism.</span></p><p><span>ps. we support and share this Manifesto:  <a href=""http://riserefugee.org/10-things-you-need-to-consider-if-you-are-an-artist-not-of-the-refugee-and-asylum-seeker-community-looking-to-work-with-our-community/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://riserefugee.org/10-things-you-need-to-consider-if-you-are-an-artist-not-of-the-refugee-and-asylum-seeker-community-looking-to-work-with-our-community/</a><br/></span></p>

Staid dopo quasi dieci anni di lavoro si sono incontrati con i loro
due differenti approcci alla ricerca sociale. Una videomaker e
disegnatrice l’altro antropologo ed etnografo hanno cominciato a
dialogare ibridando i due approcci alla ricerca, ma soprattutto si
sono impegnati  per trovare un modo innovativo di restituire al
lettore l’esperienza del ricercatore e quella vissuta dai migranti
del nuovo millennio.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><p><b>Vogliamo fare una

<p><b>Con questa campagna di
crowdfounding vogliamo coprire i costi di produzione del lavoro
(materiali, viaggi, costi dei laboratori che stiamo facendo per la

<p>
</p><p>Una ragnatela di storie,
interconnessioni, incontri transnazionali dove la sola forma scritta
non sarebbe riuscita a renderne la complessità e la ricchezza. Per
questo abbiamo deciso di sperimentare una tipologia di racconto ampia
e polimorfa, che ibrida una scrittura etnografica con disegni, foto e
frame dell’esperienza vissuta in prima persona sul campo. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Un impegno che ci siamo
posti come ricercatori è stato quello di provare a uscire dalle
categorie costruite dalle elités dominanti: migranti, rifugiati,
clandestini... 
</p>
<p>Abbiamo voluto nel nostro
lavoro decostruire queste categorie perché crediamo che sia  una
importante tappa per comprendere che siamo tutti umani al di là
delle appartenenze e differenze culturali, etniche e biologiche.</p>
<p>In questa
“<i>etnographicnovel</i>”
c’è un importante focus sul fenomeno del  cosmopolitismo migrante,
ovvero di tutte quelle  lingue parlate dai migranti che non hanno
studiato in scuole ufficiali ma hanno appreso il loro saperi nella
scuola della strada.</p>
<p>Ci siamo concentrati
soprattutto su due città, Milano e Berlino, dove abbiamo riscontrato
similitudini e differenze, ma una cosa che ci ha colpito è lo stato
di limbo<b>, </b>l’attesa, l'incertezza, la noia come parte
integrante dell’esperienza di un migrante, l’impossibilità di
lavorare nell’attesa del permesso di soggiorno, per esempio, che
porta a uno stato di annichilimento giornaliero.</p>
<p>La privazione della sfera
del “fare” è un altro aspetto
importante da sottolineare: ci siamo resi conto che molte
delle lotte dei migranti scaturite dalla non accettazione della
legislazione della “fortezza Europa”, non rivendicano soltanto
una carta, un permesso, ma rivendicano la possibilità di agire, di
“fare” per non rimanere mesi, anni parcheggiati

Senza
Confini is the project of a book – an ""etnographicnovel"" – written and drawn. It
comes out from the urgence to tell stories about contemporary
nomadism.
Francesca
Cogni and Andrea Staid, after 10 years of research and work, melt now
their different approaches to social research. Francesca is a
videomaker and painter, Andrea is an anthropologist and ethnograph.
They started a dialogue where their two research practises melt down
and hibrydate themselves. And most of all, they try to experiment a
new way to tell to the reader both experiences of researchers and
migrants of the new millenium.We want to start a
crouwdfunding campain to stay indipendent.
With this campain we want to cover the production costs 
(materials, trips, workshops costs, translations...) and part of the 
drawing and writing work. 

We want to find than a
publisher, who can distribute the book also in networks that are not
already interested in this topic. We would like to use the potential
done by drawing, with a special focus on young generations and schools.
We will also organize
presentations in Italy and Germany.
The book will be released
with a Creative Commons licence.SENZA CONFINI:

A
painter from Congo, setteled in Milan, who dreams and paints Africa;
a Gambian journalist, asylum seekers in Italy, activist, co-founder
of the African Refugees Union and reporter of refugees' movement in
Berlin; a Turkish militant, escaped from jail and tourtures made by a
despotic governement; a “double refugee” with a Palestinian
background, born Syrian, escaped in Berlin; an American rapper born
in Buffalo, grew up in Florida, migrated to California, then to
Italy, then to Berlin, who sings the margins of western society;
a Romanian girl, volunteering in a Refugees-home in
Milan...

A
net of stories, interconnections, transnational meetings where texts
would not be able to tell us its richness and complexity.
For
that reason we decided to experiment another kind of tale, wide and
polimorphic: a mix of ethnographic writing and drawings, pictures,
frames of our experience “in the field”.

What
we tried to do as researchers was to go out from categories, buid by
dominant élites: “migrant”, “refugee”, “clandestin”...
We
want to deconstruct these categories, because we believe that it is
very important in order to understand that we are all humans, beyond
cultural, ethnical and biological differencies.
In
this “ethnographicnovel”
an important focus is about “migrant cosmopolitism”: all the
languages spoken by migrants who never studied in the institutional,
official educational system but learnt the languages in the street.
We
mostly worked on two cities, Milan
and Berlin,
where we found similarities and differences. What is always the same,
is the Lymbus, the eternal waiting and the boredom as part of the
daily life of migrants: the impossibility of working  waiting
for the asylum status, for example, forced to a daily annihilation.
The
deprivation of possibility of “making” is another aspect we
wanted to highlight: we understood that many of migrant's riot
against the “Fortress Europe”, doesn't ask only for a paper, but
they claim the possibility of acting, “making” in order not to be
stuck for months, years without any possibility of changing their
situation.
In
fact, we met many forms of daily resistance, - on a small and wide
scale -, political self-organisation, attempts to speak in “first
person”, to claim rights, to find strategies and paths to get out
of the “Refugee” label and become finally a person.
In
this book we don't want to tell just “facts”. For us, it was very
important to share political ideas and discussions about
emancipation, future and imaginary with the women and men that we met
– not forcing them to a frontal interview about the past, the trip
or the tragic experience.
We
listened, talked, ate, drank, wrote and recorded; shared stories,
worked, walked together, drawn and ask them to draw memories, dreams
and desires.
We
told each other our life, but most of all we imagined together the
possibility of a better future, a world where the only stranger would
be discrimination and racism.ps. we support and share this Manifesto:  http://riserefugee.org/10-things-you-need-to-consider-if-you-are-an-artist-not-of-the-refugee-and-asylum-seeker-community-looking-to-work-with-our-community/







************************************************************************************************************************************************
Senza confini è il progetto di un libro – una ""etnographicnovel"" – scritto e disegnato, che nasce
dall’esigenza di raccontare storie del nomadismo contemporaneo. 

Francesca Cogni e Andrea
Staid dopo quasi dieci anni di lavoro si sono incontrati con i loro
due differenti approcci alla ricerca sociale. Una videomaker e
disegnatrice l’altro antropologo ed etnografo hanno cominciato a
dialogare ibridando i due approcci alla ricerca, ma soprattutto si
sono impegnati  per trovare un modo innovativo di restituire al
lettore l’esperienza del ricercatore e quella vissuta dai migranti
del nuovo millennio.

Vogliamo fare una
campagna di crowdfunding per restare indipendenti.
Con questa campagna di
crowdfounding vogliamo coprire i costi di produzione del lavoro
(materiali, viaggi, costi dei laboratori che stiamo facendo per la
ricerca, traduzioni...) e parte delle ore di lavoro di disegno e scrittura. 

Vogliamo poi cercare un
editore per il progetto, in modo da distribuirlo in circuiti diversi
da quelli già interessati al tema, sfruttando anche il potenziale
dato dall'uso del disegno, con una particolare attenzione ad
adolescenti e alle scuole.  Verranno organizzare presentazioni in
Italia e Germania.Il lavoro sarà
rilasciato con licenza Creative Commons.SENZA CONFINI:Un pittore congolese che
sogna l'Africa dalla periferia di Milano; un giornalista gambiano
rifugiato politico in Italia, attivista e fondatore del African
Refugees Union e reporter del movimento dei rifugiati a Berlino; un
militante turco scappato dal carcere e dalle torture di un governo
autoritario; un “rifugiato al quadrato” palestinese di famiglia,
siriano di nascita, berlinese per necessità; una rapper americana
nata a Buffalo, cresciuta in Florida, emigrata in California, poi in
Italia e ora a Berlino che con i suoi testi racconta i margini della
società occidentale; una ragazza rumena, che fa la volontaria in un
casa del rifugiato a Milano...

Una ragnatela di storie,
interconnessioni, incontri transnazionali dove la sola forma scritta
non sarebbe riuscita a renderne la complessità e la ricchezza. Per
questo abbiamo deciso di sperimentare una tipologia di racconto ampia
e polimorfa, che ibrida una scrittura etnografica con disegni, foto e
frame dell’esperienza vissuta in prima persona sul campo. 


Un impegno che ci siamo
posti come ricercatori è stato quello di provare a uscire dalle
categorie costruite dalle elités dominanti: migranti, rifugiati,
clandestini... 

Abbiamo voluto nel nostro
lavoro decostruire queste categorie perché crediamo che sia  una
importante tappa per comprendere che siamo tutti umani al di là
delle appartenenze e differenze culturali, etniche e biologiche.
In questa
“etnographicnovel”
c’è un importante focus sul fenomeno del  cosmopolitismo migrante,
ovvero di tutte quelle  lingue parlate dai migranti che non hanno
studiato in scuole ufficiali ma hanno appreso il loro saperi nella
scuola della strada.
Ci siamo concentrati
soprattutto su due città, Milano e Berlino, dove abbiamo riscontrato
similitudini e differenze, ma una cosa che ci ha colpito è lo stato
di limbo, l’attesa, l'incertezza, la noia come parte
integrante dell’esperienza di un migrante, l’impossibilità di
lavorare nell’attesa del permesso di soggiorno, per esempio, che
porta a uno stato di annichilimento giornaliero.
La privazione della sfera
del “fare” è un altro aspetto
importante da sottolineare: ci siamo resi conto che molte
delle lotte dei migranti scaturite dalla non accettazione della
legislazione della “fortezza Europa”, non rivendicano soltanto
una carta, un permesso, ma rivendicano la possibilità di agire, di
“fare” per non rimanere mesi, anni parcheggiati
nell’impossibilità di cambiare la propria situazione.
Abbiamo infatti incontrato
tante forme di resistenza quotidiana su piccola e grande scala,
auto-organizzazione politica, tentativi di raccontarsi in prima
persona, rivendicare i propri diritti, trovare strategie e percorsi
per uscire dall'etichetta di “rifugiato” e poter essere
finalmente una persona.

Il nostro lavoro non vuole
solo narrare i fatti, ci è sembrato importante condividere con le
donne e gli uomini incontrati racconti sulle possibilità politiche
di emancipazione e gli immaginari in costruzione invece di
costringerli ad interviste frontali sul loro passato, il viaggio e la
loro esperienza tragica. 

Abbiamo ascoltato, parlato,
mangiato, bevuto, scritto e registrato; scambiato storie, lavorato,
camminato insieme, disegnato e chiesto loro di disegnare ricordi,
sogni e desideri.
Oltre a raccontare i
vissuti abbiamo immaginato una possibilità di avvenire migliore, un
mondo nuovo dove l'unico straniero diventi la discriminazione e il
razzismo.ps. seguiamo e diffondiamo questo Manifesto:

<h3><strong>The World of Sidewinder</strong></h3>
<p>Sidewinder takes place in the far-off future and among all the technological advancements, society had commercialized gene splicing. At first, it was beneficial to aid those with medical conditions and genetic disorders, then, like many advancements in science, there was abuse. Black Market splicing augmented humans with everything from unnatural animal-like strengths and abilities to complete physical alterations. Like a drug, it caught on and through the years the mutated offspring of these individuals were anything but human, they were known as Chimera. Soon after a war known as the “Genetic Crusade” ignited, it was Chimera against the diminishing Human race. The free peoples of the Central Planets united. They fought and defeated the Chimera at a great cost. After the war, any remaining Chimera was forced into the outer rim planets, a haven for outlaws and undesirables. So it’s in this setting that our Bounty Hunter, Sidewinder lives.

<h3><strong>The Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Sidewinder's first three volumes were published by Antarctic Press 3-years ago, we were not able to finish the story arc and the final issue due to a miscommunication with the publisher. Even tho AP tried to publish the last issue, there was no room on the schedule or on the press to do so. Pitching a science fiction graphic novel like this can be a tough sell in an industry saturated with Super Heroes &amp; Zombies (Even though we love Super Heroes &amp; Zombies lol). There are very few publishers that would take a chance on a Sci-Fi project like SIDEWINDER and it’s even harder for an unknown comic book creator to get published. That's why we’re going down the “crowdfunding” route to get the necessary funds to make the SIDEWINDER graphic novel a reality.</p>
<p>What’s great about Indiegogo is that it gives new intellectual properties, ideas, and creations outside of the mainstream comic book industry a chance to make it out into the world, this project is a perfect example of that.</p>

</div></div>","The World of Sidewinder
Sidewinder takes place in the far-off future and among all the technological advancements, society had commercialized gene splicing. At first, it was beneficial to aid those with medical conditions and genetic disorders, then, like many advancements in science, there was abuse. Black Market splicing augmented humans with everything from unnatural animal-like strengths and abilities to complete physical alterations. Like a drug, it caught on and through the years the mutated offspring of these individuals were anything but human, they were known as Chimera. Soon after a war known as the “Genetic Crusade” ignited, it was Chimera against the diminishing Human race. The free peoples of the Central Planets united. They fought and defeated the Chimera at a great cost. After the war, any remaining Chimera was forced into the outer rim planets, a haven for outlaws and undesirables. So it’s in this setting that our Bounty Hunter, Sidewinder lives. Like most in his profession, for the most part, he wants nothing to do with the United Earth Government and tries his best to stay off the grid avoiding any Authorities or corrupted Civic Dignitaries. Sidewinder along with his two fellow crafty Bounty Hunters, Lucky and Trinity, track down their usual fare of bounties. Normally Sidewinder is strictly about business but it turns personal when he catches news that an old friend from “The War” has been murdered. Sidewinder sets out for revenge and uncovers shady clues surrounding his friend's murder and is quickly thrown into a much larger and sinister plot.

</div></div>","When growing in the ex-USSR you see those monuments everywhere. One day you will think - why are there so many of them? 
Are these really just monuments?

Hello, we are a team of animation and design professionals. For many years we’ve been keeping our own story about the biggest, most secret Soviet project:
GORB: Cold War era battle mecha system


Right now you can participate in the development of the first chapter. We offer many options - digital or printed comics, resin or metal figures - and all this is just the beginning. So, feel free to preorder your part of adventure (we have LIFETIME DISCOUNT for our first backers).
Part 1. Comic Book

The story was in the works for more than 15 years. There is no politics - just atmospheric, sci-fi ""road-movie"" adventure.  

 
There were several attempts to materialize the story, probably too big and ambitious. And then we met a great artist, Alexander Utkin. He applied his own unique hand-drawn style, and the characters came to life.
 
Alexander: «It’s an epic battle between the Past and the Future. You can’t hide from it, but you may have fun during it»
 


 
Read an interview with the creators of Project GORB on the Comic Book and Movie Reviews.​

As an animation studio we wanted this story to be highly cinematic, and it took us more than one year of work to develop this unique visual style.
Read the excerpt (opens in a new window):

So you can contribute to the comic book development only. We have digital and printed comics, T-Shirt with a logo, and impressive A2-sized poster by the animation artist Natalia Grebionkina (all available both in English and Russian). First buyers of the Story Pack will get the LIFETIME DISCOUNT for all our further phisical goods.
  Part 2. RobotFirst, we intended to tell the story as a big graphic novel. But then it became so alive, that we decided to let it out, straight to the physical world. So, every issue of the comics will be accompanied by a collectible item.2.1. Bust Resin KitA bust is smallest in the line of figures, but its robotic head is big enough to show the details.2.2. Figure Resin KitStatue of soviet battle robot has two sizes - 7"" and 12"" (18cm/30cm). Designing the statue took more than a year. We consulted with engineers and scientists  to develop a highly original robot concept that you will find in the forthcoming issues of the comic.It was a non-trivial task to integrate the robot into the chaotically fractured concrete shell. Three scanned statues were used for sculpting, along with hard surface modelling, dynamic fractures and cloth simulation.The work is still in progress, all you see here are the prototypes. The final product will vary (but only for better quality).For pricing see the table. This perk also includes the Story Pack.  2.3. Figure Metal KitCold-cast iron edition of the kit is like a half-ready figurine (for those, who don't feel like  painting it). It needs just a bit of polishing after assembling. Real rust, metal scratches and other weathering can be easily implemented.All you see here are the prototypes. The final product will vary (but only for better quality).This perk also includes the Story Pack.2.4. Assembled StatueWe decided to introduce this perk for those who don't want to do deal with chemicals at home. For you it will be a figurine ready for exposition, assembled, weathered and polished, for us it will be like a step to producing  more complicated full-color figures.

This perk also includes the Story Pack.
3. Pricing and shipping.
Story Pack included everywhere, and we have 5% LIFETIME DISCOUNT to all further physical products by Condenser Labs.

4. Timeline

The production of the figurine starts as soon as the campaign reaches its main goal. We have a lot to improve in the model, including upgrade of our 3D printing equipment, research for cold casting etc. Shipping is scheduled for the mid of 2019.

7. What's next?
We have big plans for this story, but that's not the only story we have (you can see a little more here)
So, you can spread the word about this campaign to help Condenser Labs become an independent storytelling company.

<p><strong>Mission</strong> </p>
<p>When I started working on Black Sun, I only knew that I wanted to create something meaningful. I had seen what was out there, in terms of media focused on new stories, and I understood that there was a gap.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To me, there was only one choice. I had to create something of my own, and I had to do it in my own way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The response my webtoon has  received is phenomenal and As the following continues to grow, I feel more and more confident that I have stumbled into something important. I could not be any happier than I am with the way this webtoon has gone. Every day, I feel the same deep sense of motivation that inspired the webtoon in the first place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I know that it can get even bigger, though.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/taqy4XGaic0?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>I know that, together, we can do even more through Black Sun.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before I explain how in more detail, let me tell you a little about what Black Sun is to me and how it has grown so far.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1624313936/qo8xj5w9hhftwkvai7av.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<p><strong>Shonen with a Purpose</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>While Black Sun is a fully engaging supernatural Shinobi horror series in its own right, something that all Shonen fans will appreciate, is that it inspires and celebrates new creative minds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>This webtoon is Created to motivate </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625085813/lmksfmfl83ebfuio3ww8.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<p>In order to foster a stronger self-image in the Black community, we need to escape the vicious cycle that these negative portrayals perpetuate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That is, on a fundamental level, what Black Sun is about. I have created my webtoon as an expression of other possibilities – of stories that aren't about Black trauma like slavery, poverty, and broken homes.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p><strong>Entertainment for All</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625084820/z7ytuvmwupjy1uapeuhf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I take my responsibility seriously. When I sit down and start working on a new webtoon, I understand that I can take it one of two ways, either stepping up and doing something positive for the community or falling into the endless traps of stereotypes and dangerous tropes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Throughout my creative career, I have chosen to do the former. I have sought to tell stories that will encourage the next generation to see themselves as the capable people I know they can be.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625085880/y3h2caynzmgvdwno2m4t.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>At the same time, I think of myself as a creator for all audiences. I have developed Black Sun as a webtoon that everyone can enjoy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Whether you put it on for your sons or daughters, because you know it will shape their minds for the better, or you sit down and watch it with your friends, because the stories are just that good, I am doing my job right.</p>
<p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1624313868/br3ggldld1wbzvtkz3bv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Growth to Date</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Currently, Black Sun is the #1 series in the Action genre on Webtoon Canvas. It has also gained more than 41,000 followers on Instagram and 67 patrons on Patreon, both reflections of how wide-reaching the webtoon is.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every Wednesday, I come out with new webtoons. That is not going to change.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625086642/bm2h5nrsej6idgcbhu3w.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>What I would like to do, though, is expand the brand behind Black Sun – by turning the webtoon into an animated series.</p>
<p><br/>Although major producers have offered to buy the IP for Black Sun, I have turned them down every time, preferring to carry the vision out on my own.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If that sounds like the kind of thing that you would like to be a part of, now is the time to get involved.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Right now, I am turning to you for help raising the funds that I need to transform the Black Sun webtoon into a high-quality animated series. My goal is ${amount}, which will enable me to hire animators, voiceover artists, and other creatives and professionals who feel as dedicated to Black Sun as I do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To say thanks to everyone who contributes to this campaign, I am offering some exclusive rewards, including early access to the debut episodes of the Black Sun animated series and limited-edition Black Sun merchandise.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Because Black Sun is already online, as a webtoon, there is no risk that you're going to see the brand up and disappear. I will continue to work on the webtoon, doing new releases every Wednesday, just as I have been. Launching an animated series takes another level of work, though. Unless I reach the funding goal I have set, I will not be able to move forward with that aspect of the Black Sun brand as quickly as I would like.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Whatever happens, you can count on me to remain open throughout this process. I will provide regular updates about the progress that I make, letting you know all of the steps that I am taking to get this animated series up.</p>

When I started working on Black Sun, I only knew that I wanted to create something meaningful. I had seen what was out there, in terms of media focused on new stories, and I understood that there was a gap.
 
To me, there was only one choice. I had to create something of my own, and I had to do it in my own way.
 
The response my webtoon has  received is phenomenal and As the following continues to grow, I feel more and more confident that I have stumbled into something important. I could not be any happier than I am with the way this webtoon has gone. Every day, I feel the same deep sense of motivation that inspired the webtoon in the first place.
 
I know that it can get even bigger, though.

I know that, together, we can do even more through Black Sun.
 
Before I explain how in more detail, let me tell you a little about what Black Sun is to me and how it has grown so far.
 
Shonen with a Purpose
 
While Black Sun is a fully engaging supernatural Shinobi horror series in its own right, something that all Shonen fans will appreciate, is that it inspires and celebrates new creative minds.
 
This webtoon is Created to motivate 
 
In order to foster a stronger self-image in the Black community, we need to escape the vicious cycle that these negative portrayals perpetuate.
 
That is, on a fundamental level, what Black Sun is about. I have created my webtoon as an expression of other possibilities – of stories that aren't about Black trauma like slavery, poverty, and broken homes.
 
Entertainment for All

I take my responsibility seriously. When I sit down and start working on a new webtoon, I understand that I can take it one of two ways, either stepping up and doing something positive for the community or falling into the endless traps of stereotypes and dangerous tropes.
 
Throughout my creative career, I have chosen to do the former. I have sought to tell stories that will encourage the next generation to see themselves as the capable people I know they can be.

At the same time, I think of myself as a creator for all audiences. I have developed Black Sun as a webtoon that everyone can enjoy.
 
Whether you put it on for your sons or daughters, because you know it will shape their minds for the better, or you sit down and watch it with your friends, because the stories are just that good, I am doing my job right.

Growth to Date
 
Currently, Black Sun is the #1 series in the Action genre on Webtoon Canvas. It has also gained more than 41,000 followers on Instagram and 67 patrons on Patreon, both reflections of how wide-reaching the webtoon is.
 
Every Wednesday, I come out with new webtoons. That is not going to change.

What I would like to do, though, is expand the brand behind Black Sun – by turning the webtoon into an animated series.
Although major producers have offered to buy the IP for Black Sun, I have turned them down every time, preferring to carry the vision out on my own.
 
If that sounds like the kind of thing that you would like to be a part of, now is the time to get involved.
 
What I Need & What You Get
 
Right now, I am turning to you for help raising the funds that I need to transform the Black Sun webtoon into a high-quality animated series. My goal is ${amount}, which will enable me to hire animators, voiceover artists, and other creatives and professionals who feel as dedicated to Black Sun as I do.
 
To say thanks to everyone who contributes to this campaign, I am offering some exclusive rewards, including early access to the debut episodes of the Black Sun animated series and limited-edition Black Sun merchandise.
 
Contribute now and help me bring the world of Black Sun to life!

Risks & Challenges
 
Because Black Sun is already online, as a webtoon, there is no risk that you're going to see the brand up and disappear. I will continue to work on the webtoon, doing new releases every Wednesday, just as I have been. Launching an animated series takes another level of work, though. Unless I reach the funding goal I have set, I will not be able to move forward with that aspect of the Black Sun brand as quickly as I would like.
 
Whatever happens, you can count on me to remain open throughout this process. I will provide regular updates about the progress that I make, letting you know all of the steps that I am taking to get this animated series up.
One More Way to Help
 
In addition to making a monetary contribution to this campaign, you can show your support for Black Sun by sharing a link to the campaign page on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and any other social media platforms you use. The more people are aware of Black Sun, the smoother the next year or so is going to go for me. It is my dream to get this animated series made.
 
Let's make it happen!
 
I appreciate all your support, and I thank you for your time.",19.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Herverity is an adult limited series about a young 17-year-old girl named Aislinn Byrnes, who is dealing with the loss of a family member. After one crazy night, she soon realizes that she is one of the last of her kind. Unfortunately, she was not the only one to make that discovery, as a dark and looming threat closes in on her. Aislinn must quickly decide on who to trust and what her next move will be. One wrong choice could mean the end of her, and most importantly...the end of her kind.</p>

ANSWER: To make you laugh...To get you on our side and dramatize how epic, sometimes futile, running a crowd-funding campaign is. 
We're working SO hard... We need you to take action! Check the GALLERY for the shorts, ""I Just Want To Make My Movie,"" ""Skype Hell,"" ""Fated To Pretend,"" ""Edit,"" ""Do It Now,"" ""I Can't Go For That"" and now, ""HELP!""

FROM OUR WRITER/DIRECTOR, JOHN FRANCIS SULLIVAN 

""I've seen a lot of pitch videos by filmmakers looking for money to make their movies and thought it'd make fun of myself and this process. So, making a mini TV series about crowd-funding. If you like the shorts and laughed, please contribute. I identify with every filmmaker's plight... ""I just want to make my movie."" That's my mission and I NEED YOUR HELP!  

JOHN FRANCIS SULLIVAN, Writer/Director of SLEEPOVER and FOLLOW ME OUTSIDE, screenwriter of ENDLESS BUMMER, YESHUA, THE MISSING YEARS OF JESUS, BUSTER KEATON BIOPIC, NIKOLA TESLA BIOPIC and others is an NYU Film School graduate, accomplished filmmaker and proven creative talent. 
""After writing like twenty screenplays, some paid, some not, some specs (that means unpaid) and a few TV pilots, only ENDLESS BUMMER got made. I have too many scripts and wasn't satisfied with how ENDLESS BUMMER came out and had to ask, ""Could I do any better?"" Yes, I think I can. So I'm making a(nother) feature, ""TASTE OF LIFE,"" to prove it. I put together a great team of collaborators with a simple goal: make a great movie that will change... EVERYTHING! 
First, we needed an idea that could be shot for very little money.  ""TASTE OF LIFE"" is that idea turned into a screenplay. Now we need money to make it.  Sound familiar? That's where you come in. Won't you contribute and forward the link?
TASTE OF LIFE is a funny, gut-wrenching story with a simple message: we all experience heartache and life is tough. You could lose your job, lose the love of your life, lose a body part... but life is also short, so you better enjoy it.  
Our goal is also simple: make people happy and laugh, sad and cry; feel and connect with the story and characters. We're confident that by end of this process we will accomplish these worthwhile and achievable goals.""     
What We Need & What You Get:

It costs under 35K to make this film: locations, building and dressing sets, paying actors and crew, renting equipment and feeding everyone. Nothing will be wasted. 
You will receive PERKS but if you want something else, let us know! This is a two way street. Go for ""The Heather Locklear"" and contribute $2 and tell two friends so they tell two friends and so on, and so on... That's social networking the marketing dept. at Herbal Essences could have never dreamed about!

The Impact, Risks & Challenges:
There's no risk. Everyone who funds the movie, even for a couple bucks ($2), will get ASSOCIATE PRODUCER credit. You will enable a great film to get made that can touch potentially millions of lives, at least hundreds... And help a group of actors and crew to practice their craft for ridiculously low wages while you relax.  
 You risk nothing and gain... EVERYTHING!  When you contribute, your money will be stretched further than what should be allowed by law. That said, we'll get signed contracts from everyone and make it all legal. The biggest challenge is to make a great film, and with your help to turn this into a CROWD-funded film -- WE WILL! 
Other Ways You Can Help:
 We need cash, but if you are in LA and are an actor or crew person, reach out... But first make a contribution to help us reach our goal and -- SHARE THAT LINK!!!

<p>Howdy Ho Folks! We are Red Panda Studio, an independent design studio in Colombia who wants to geek out and make a living from it! We have done several projects seeking to fulfill this dream but certainly the most ambitious one is the Reset project. Inspired by the 80's movies and cartoons, time travel and factual science! Simon (co-founder of Red Panda Studio) created Fots, a character from the future whose powers come from technology, so advanced and beyond our knowledge that is perceived as magic or superpowers by people in the present.</p>
<p>Fots gets stuck in the past by accident, and being disconnected from his natural environment, begins to experience a series of problems affecting his ""powers"" and slowly starts to die. With the help of two characters out of the ordinary, a homeless child named Tomás and a young pastry called Juno with dreams of becoming a famous Jazz singer, Fots will discover that the past has much more to offer than he imagines, and it will begin a race against time to get back to the future before it's too late!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471911456/n5ozc8yhtkvglr5c2xtu.png"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p>The story begins in a distant future, hundreds of years after the revolution of the 7 colors, as it is called in historical records, when a group of radical idealists discovers that in the world exists the technology capable of solving mankind's problems and promote peace.This group of radicals decided to create and detonate a technological bomb thus ending hunger, diseases, inequality and humanity as we know it. By merging humans with machines, they created a new species with amazing abilities. These beings are known as the Nova, they live in peace and harmony while keeping the balance on planet Earth and exploring the universe to unveil the mysteries of existence, until an accident occurs and one of them is transported to the past, where disconnected from their natural environment starts to die …</p>
<p>So it begins the story and  the adventures of Fots, a Nova stuck in the past, a homeless child (Tomas) and a young singer (Juno), trying to find a way to send Fots back when he came from before it is too late for him and the future he knows …</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In Colombia, the comic book industry is still small, although every year there are more and more fans and readers, we still have a long way ahead. We want to inspire new generations of Colombian artists to pursue their dreams as we have done. But perhaps most importantly, we want to change the idea of the future we have. We are tired of seeing a chaotic future, where the world is ripped off and humanity has come to destruction!</p>
<p>We strongly believe in a positive future where we will live in community with our planet! Through this series of comics we want to show the harsh reality we live in, not only in Colombia but the entire world, and we want to show that we can change things if we work together! we're still in time to change the future and this is what Reset is all about!<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> </span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>The main challenge we have is time. Although we estimated dates, these may vary because we depend on many external factors. Another possible risk is comic printing, unfortunately we live in a country where many productive aspects depend on the change in dollar's price, which strongly affects our economy and therefore production prices. As for the challenges we face, we are a small independent team, and although we work with experts and awesome artists who know the comics industry, we know that may be problems when carrying out the project. The way to address these eventualities is hard and constant work.</p>
<p>If is there is something we can guarantee is that we are awesome workers, committed and responsible. In the coming months we will work tirelessly to bring this project forward, not only because it is a commitment to you, but because it's what we love! This is a dream that we have pursued for a long time and be assured that we are giving our 100% to make this possible, even against all odds.</p>

She will become Fots's guide in the present and will always seek new adventures to share with him. Helping Fots to return home will become a way for Juno to fulfill her own dreams ...
Age: 16 years / Height: 155cm / Weight: 50kg / Favorite Food: Ajiaco / Fear: Spiders / Changes clothes constantly / she has 17 pairs of shoes and 15 glasses.

The Vante-KX are the Void Novas. Their task is maintaining the balance of the species over the planet. When Fots goes back to the past leaves a portal open behind, and eventually the Vante-KX find this portal. Back in the past The Vante-KX see humans as a species out of control and immediately try to correct this ""error"" by wiping them out, without noticing how they're changing the future....

The main story is told in three seasons compiled in six 40-page comics. Each season is more exciting than the one before, and has stranger and complex characters as well as new stories of time travel and parallel realities. Volume One is just the beginning of the story and tells the adventures of Fots trying to get back to the future with the help of his friends ...

Even Though we would like to do all the work, we can't do everything! so we are supported by a team of experts writers and illustrators.

Go Up Comics is the publisher who works with us on this project. With its long experience in comic books development and incredible team of artists and writers we've been able to keep this project going.

The series has potential, we have planned two more seasons and we want to continue telling stories if you like them …In volumes two and three, Fots discovers how to travel freely through time and returns to visit his friends at different times and dates, thus triggering different stories each time he travels to the past.


 


As we said before, this is just the beginning of history, we have many things planned and saved in case we get the answer we seek and if you like our comics, many many more will come, is a promise!
together we can create an entire universe!! We just need your support to make this dream come true.

 


What we need and what you get
Making comic books for living is not easy, even though our moms believe in us and give us food, we still need to pay taxes, on top of that to tell good stories we need a dedicated and talented team.

 
How we will use the resources?
Most of the budget will be used in the production of comics.
54% of the budget will be used in the development of comic, illustrators, writers and the lady who brings the coffee to work nonstop and deliver this project as soon as possible!
21% will be used to print the first two comics series!
20% Perks sweet and amazing Perks! this project makes us happy, but it is for you and the perks are how to thank you for your cooperation!
The last 5% is business stuff! a percentage that goes to Indiegogo for... well business stuff!
 If we don't get money from the goal, the resources will be used in the production of comics to fulfill the most important rewards.
The Impact
In Colombia, the comic book industry is still small, although every year there are more and more fans and readers, we still have a long way ahead. We want to inspire new generations of Colombian artists to pursue their dreams as we have done. But perhaps most importantly, we want to change the idea of the future we have. We are tired of seeing a chaotic future, where the world is ripped off and humanity has come to destruction!
We strongly believe in a positive future where we will live in community with our planet! Through this series of comics we want to show the harsh reality we live in, not only in Colombia but the entire world, and we want to show that we can change things if we work together! we're still in time to change the future and this is what Reset is all about! 

Risks and Challenges
The main challenge we have is time. Although we estimated dates, these may vary because we depend on many external factors. Another possible risk is comic printing, unfortunately we live in a country where many productive aspects depend on the change in dollar's price, which strongly affects our economy and therefore production prices. As for the challenges we face, we are a small independent team, and although we work with experts and awesome artists who know the comics industry, we know that may be problems when carrying out the project. The way to address these eventualities is hard and constant work.
If is there is something we can guarantee is that we are awesome workers, committed and responsible. In the coming months we will work tirelessly to bring this project forward, not only because it is a commitment to you, but because it's what we love! This is a dream that we have pursued for a long time and be assured that we are giving our 100% to make this possible, even against all odds.

It's both an homage to, and a parody of, all of our favorite movies/books/heroes; from Batman to Sin City, from Casablanca to Escape From New York, the Walter Malone comic book series encompasses the essence of all our favorite stuff and uses humanized food as a vessel to express our love for said ""stuff"".</p><p>It started out as a joke between the two of us and was really just an outlet for making horrible puns.

This will allow us to supply our supporters with copies, as well as have a a good amount left over with which we can take with us to conventions and such to get our work out there and to hopefully gather a following/fanbase for the book, as we do plan on keeping it going as a series.</p><p>This is a passion project for us. Dividing all the work (writing, drawing, planning, inking, text, editing, etc.) is a hefty work-load for two people, but that's how much we love this project.

<p>As a comedian/musician I was musical director for 14 Comedy Channel shows and one Showtime Special. As an instrumentalist I play percussion, piano, guitar, Japanese shakuhachi flute, trumpet and shofar. I have a world beat music band. We play ""Zen Jazz"" which sounds like African, Japanese, Jewish, Latin, Caribbean Bebop. I've produced four music CD's, two comedy CD's and written a book called ""The Complete Book of Everything, Part 1, Second Edition."" It's a collection of comedy monologues. My soon to be published autobiography is called, ""The Joy of Suffering."" My one man show, ""The Reluctant Jew,"" was staged at various theaters in Los Angeles and got rave reviews. I've done comedy and played music in temples, prisons, nightclubs, retirement homes, weddings, AA &amp; NA conventions, and one briss.</p>
<p>A few months ago, at a comedy show in temple, I was the opening act for comedian Mark Schiff. Afterwards, he emailed me and wrote, “I loved your set. You have one of the most Jewish acts I’ve ever seen. I respect you going out so openly and singing and talking about the great parts of being a Jew. I’m so glad I got to see you work.”</p>

<p><strong>Echoes of Mutiny </strong>is a very rough translation of ""<strong>Ghadar Di Goonj</strong>,"" the early revolutionary literature of Sikh resistance fighters during the British occupation. This compilation of poetry and war-cries gave rise to generations of revolutionaries that died fighting for the establishment of <strong>Khalsa Raj. </strong></p>

</div></div>","Echoes of Mutiny is a very rough translation of ""Ghadar Di Goonj,"" the early revolutionary literature of Sikh resistance fighters during the British occupation. This compilation of poetry and war-cries gave rise to generations of revolutionaries that died fighting for the establishment of Khalsa Raj.

<h3>Who we are...</h3> <p>My name is Brian Conoley and I am crazy about comics. </p>
<p>Ever since I could look at a picture I have devoured sequential art in a frenzy that has fuelled my imagination and filled my book shelves. From spandex clad heroes, to crime noir-pulp  &amp; indie love tales, there is not a genre I have left behind.</p>

<p>After years of being tormented by this tragic disorder, struggling to keep the monster growing inside of him at bay, Jeremy is forced to live his life inside of mental institutions and prisons.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Stephen Hamilton and I am a painter, illustrator and arts educator from Boston Massachusetts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Itan: Part 1 is a graphic novel that is based on the oral literature traditions of the Yoruba people of West Africa. The comic is heavily influenced by Yoruba art and aesthetics, combining traditional West african textile and sculpture traditions with western painting and illustration. Drawing directly from Ifa, the vast corpus of divination poetry used by the followers of the Yoruba Orisa traditions worldwide (as well as other Yoruba verbal arts) I am relaying important narratives rooted in African thought.  </li>
<li>People, especially young people want to see themselves in the world, especially in the media that they ingest.  Lack of representation is an serious issue for people of color especially youth. The absence of our narratives in both media and academia contributes to lack of sense of self, and place.  Itan addresses that problem by relaying these important narratives through comics ,an art form that is accessible both physically and conceptually. It is meant to highlight  the often ignored and underrepresented narratives of Africa and the Diaspora through intriguing stories rooted in African thought and aesthetics. </li>
</ul>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
</div><div><ul>
<li>We are asking for 250 early adopters to preorder the comic, which is set for completion in November 2017. A total of $5000 is needed to print and distribute a 500 copy run of the graphic novel</li>
<li>A $30 investment will earn you a signed copy of the graphic novel along with a 4 pack set of limited edition promotional postcards</li>
<li>A $50 Investment will earn you a signed copy of the of the graphic novel, with a 4 pack set of limited edition promotional postcards and a limited edition 18""x24"" Promotional poster </li>
<li>A $1000 Investment will  earn you a signed copy of the graphic novel along with a 4 pack set of limited edition promotional postcards, a limited edition 18""x24"" promotional poster as well as a signed, framed original hand painted panel from Itan: part 1. </li>
<li>If the goal is not reached all funds will still go towards the comic and will be saved until printing costs can be covered.</li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>This graphic novel is my way of creating and highlighting empowering narratives created by and depicting people of African descent.  As an artist and educator it is my mission to use my work and teaching praxis to address and help eradicate issues of internalized and institutionalized racism. This graphic novel is a manifestation of that mission. I hope to depict the beauty, complexity and perseverance of one of the richest and most influential, philosophical traditions in Africa, one that survived the horrors of the slave trade and colonialism. This book is meant to be testament to the power, endurance and depth African thought and aesthetics.</li>
<li>I was the 2015-2016 Arts Connect International artist in residence. During that time I had the opportunity to learning the traditional weaving, woodcarving and dyeing traditions that I am incorporating into this book at The Nike Centers For Art And Culture In Lagos, Osogbo and Ogidi-Ijumu. I also had the opportunity the learn more about Ifa and other Yoruba religious traditions from members of the West African Orisa tradition in Osogbo. During that time I completed a series of large scale paintings utilizing the same techniques I am using to create Itan: Part 1 , a selection of which can be viewed at <a href=""http://www.itanproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.itanproject.com</a>.  The work from this residency was then exhibited  at the Museum of The Center of African American Artists in Boston, MA.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main challenge is  the time and effort it will take to complete the comic. I am creating and incorporating, woodcarving, weaving and dyeing arts into the comic book illustrations. This non traditional comic art technique will require more time and effort to complete. However it is of the utmost importance that I highlight these traditional arts along with these narratives to create a unique piece of sequential art, best representing the Yoruba aesthetic and cultural corpus.   </p>
<ul>
<li>I have 8+ years experience as a professional artists and will do anything in my power to complete this project, which has ben many years in the making.</li>
<li>Each chapter of the graphic novel is carefully planned , and I have been careful to calculate and arrange my schedule around a November release date. Although it will be tight I am sure I will complete the project and have it in your hands in November.</li>

Virtual History.</h3><p>When Ethan Lewis, founder of Starry Sky Entertainment, first conceived of the idea to create an original English language (OEL) manga back in late 2016, it seemed like a flight of fancy. Aware of the oftentimes negative connotation surrounding international manga, Ethan wondered whether it was possible to create masterpieces of manga outside of Japan that would be taken seriously. Looking closely at the industry, he found that purists often compared the works of the great Japanese masters to vastly inferior, sub-par works. There were obviously many legendary comic book creators in the West, but at a time when international Japanese manga sales are higher than they've ever been, why weren't more artists and writers trying their hand at global manga? His upbringing richly steeped in a nerdy stew of comics, anime, manga, science-fiction and fantasy adventure, Ethan believed that if the right artistic talent could be connected to the right literary vision, it <strong><i>was </i></strong>possible to create a manga masterpiece outside of Japan in the same way that Marvel and DC comics both first built their empires. By contributing to this campaign, you'll help make history by proving it!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520478274/avxzlsj17zco08mhljlq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Welcome to Yotta</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Welcome, <strong>User</strong>! Make sure your <strong>biosoft'</strong>s up to date, and you'll always be <strong>solid state</strong>!</i></p><p><strong>Imagine you're in the year 2025. </strong>Overpopulation and resource privation has forced mankind to cram into densely-packed micro-cities owned by big corporations, operating within governmental wards. For most ordinary citizens, food, drink, and utilitarian items are carefully rationed. The world is bleak, claustrophobic, and choking to death on its own iniquity and shame.</p><p>With alcohol and drugs nearly completely off the table as forms of recreation,<strong><i>The Neuropolis </i></strong>takes its place. Gigantic virtual reality farms where people flock from near and far to plug into a reality far better than their own, Neuropoli rise out of the shadows and dust of old-world cities like pillars of the Gods, jealously guarded by neuronet cartels and grayhosts that sell access to the Neuropolis at exorbitant rates. The police of this virtual paradise are the <strong><i>Waifucom Girls</i></strong>, avatars designed by the creators of the neuronet, <strong><i>Waifucom Systems</i></strong>. Chosen exclusively from a female pool of candidates (only one-in-one-million males can experience biosynergy with the system's core), the young women of Waifucom are international celebrities, often seen as living lives of extreme luxury, completely ignoring ration restrictions. They, unlike everyone else, are designed to be able to bend, and in some cases, break the rules if necessary to keep the system safe from netheads who get a little too rowdy within the system, or in the worse case scenario, viruses.</p><p>Shousuke Hirata was just your average half-Japanese teen living in one of the nameless tech ghettos surrounding the Fujisama Neuropolis. He, with his two friends, comprised a completely unnoticeable hacker group called <strong><i>The Script Kiddies. </i></strong>Only one day, Shousuke accidentally discovered a highly-illegal backdoor into Waifucom's quantum servers, and inadvertently triggered a cyber prophecy that could very well lead to the destruction of the neuronet itself—and everyone plugged into it. Shousuke will have to overcome all of his insecurities and find the strength within himself to save the virtual world of Yotta from a virus hellbent on a complete system crash. But first, he'll have to learn to deal with being a girl.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Plug-in and Join Yotta!</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522641485/cup4xkvospc6q1qdfpqh.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Come join us on our incredible journey in getting Yottapocalypse made by contributing money which, for the purposes of our virtual world, we'll call <strong><i>bytes</i></strong>!

</ul><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">So What Are the Risks?</h3><p>As stated, this campaign will be flexible and progressive, continuing on until we either run out of funding or there's no identifiable interest in the book and hence no marketability. Nevertheless, Starry Sky Entertainment will ensure that the book will see both a digital and a paperback print of the 120-page book in its entirety, ensuring all artists get paid and all contributors rewarded to their satisfaction. The book will simply not continue past the first volume until we are able to secure additional funding from other means such as outside investment, however our promise is that <strong><i>everyone </i></strong>will receive a completed digital copy of the manga regardless of whether or not our goals are met, and everyone who donated <strong>$100 or more </strong>will be guaranteed a limited print of the first volume run even in the event we do not meet financial goals. Starry Sky Entertainment has already demonstrated its stake in the project by paying artist salaries, translation services, branding, graphic design and social media marketing. We will also attend several of the biggest anime conventions in the northeastern United States region (Anime Boston, Another Anime Convention, Portcon Maine, Katsucon, and Rhode Island Comiccon) where we plan to operate booths to sell the manga to further reinforce the backbone of the profit and increase market visibility.</p><p>We thank you from the bottoms of our hearts for considering contributing your hard-earned bytes to our cause, and for your desire to come make history with us!

Whether it be through his prolific, diverse, and fearlessly-creative body of work, his myriad Q&amp;A sessions and interviews, or through his books, Smith has always been the voice in my ear encouraging me to see my creative vision to a finished product. Though I'd practically grown up with many of his films, it wasn't until I read his book <i>Tough Sh*t: Life Advice from a Fat, Lazy Slob Who Did Good  </i>back in 2013 that really lit the fire under my backside and got me putting plans in motion and sharpening my skills to make all of this happen. Kevin has said innumerable times before, that sometimes if you want to see something out there in the world that you want to see, read, experience or enjoy, sometimes you have to go out into the world and make it yourself, because nobody is going to make it for you. These words have forever stuck with me as he helped me to find the confidence, direction, means and impetus to develop my creative abilities and business acumen to the point where I was able to make this fundraiser a reality. For all the inspiration, the drive, the perseverance, and the hope he has instilled within me, I am forever in the debt of Mr. Kevin Smith, without whom the world of Yottapocalypse would certainly not exist beyond the periphery of my own mind.</p></div>","“A work of art is the trace of a magnificent struggle.”—Grace Hartigan, American abstract expressionist painterMaking History. Virtual History.When Ethan Lewis, founder of Starry Sky Entertainment, first conceived of the idea to create an original English language (OEL) manga back in late 2016, it seemed like a flight of fancy. Aware of the oftentimes negative connotation surrounding international manga, Ethan wondered whether it was possible to create masterpieces of manga outside of Japan that would be taken seriously. Looking closely at the industry, he found that purists often compared the works of the great Japanese masters to vastly inferior, sub-par works. There were obviously many legendary comic book creators in the West, but at a time when international Japanese manga sales are higher than they've ever been, why weren't more artists and writers trying their hand at global manga? His upbringing richly steeped in a nerdy stew of comics, anime, manga, science-fiction and fantasy adventure, Ethan believed that if the right artistic talent could be connected to the right literary vision, it was possible to create a manga masterpiece outside of Japan in the same way that Marvel and DC comics both first built their empires. By contributing to this campaign, you'll help make history by proving it!Welcome to YottaWelcome, User! Make sure your biosoft's up to date, and you'll always be solid state!Imagine you're in the year 2025. Overpopulation and resource privation has forced mankind to cram into densely-packed micro-cities owned by big corporations, operating within governmental wards. For most ordinary citizens, food, drink, and utilitarian items are carefully rationed. The world is bleak, claustrophobic, and choking to death on its own iniquity and shame.With alcohol and drugs nearly completely off the table as forms of recreation,The Neuropolis takes its place. Gigantic virtual reality farms where people flock from near and far to plug into a reality far better than their own, Neuropoli rise out of the shadows and dust of old-world cities like pillars of the Gods, jealously guarded by neuronet cartels and grayhosts that sell access to the Neuropolis at exorbitant rates. The police of this virtual paradise are the Waifucom Girls, avatars designed by the creators of the neuronet, Waifucom Systems. Chosen exclusively from a female pool of candidates (only one-in-one-million males can experience biosynergy with the system's core), the young women of Waifucom are international celebrities, often seen as living lives of extreme luxury, completely ignoring ration restrictions. They, unlike everyone else, are designed to be able to bend, and in some cases, break the rules if necessary to keep the system safe from netheads who get a little too rowdy within the system, or in the worse case scenario, viruses.Shousuke Hirata was just your average half-Japanese teen living in one of the nameless tech ghettos surrounding the Fujisama Neuropolis. He, with his two friends, comprised a completely unnoticeable hacker group called The Script Kiddies. Only one day, Shousuke accidentally discovered a highly-illegal backdoor into Waifucom's quantum servers, and inadvertently triggered a cyber prophecy that could very well lead to the destruction of the neuronet itself—and everyone plugged into it. Shousuke will have to overcome all of his insecurities and find the strength within himself to save the virtual world of Yotta from a virus hellbent on a complete system crash. But first, he'll have to learn to deal with being a girl.Plug-in and Join Yotta!Come join us on our incredible journey in getting Yottapocalypse made by contributing money which, for the purposes of our virtual world, we'll call bytes! Every byte we receive through your contributions will help alleviate the costs of both paying our artists for all their hard work and covering the distribution end of the paperback graphic novel itself, when it is released. First, we'll show you exactly how your contributions are going to be put to best use:Distribution ScheduleAs mentioned above, the main goal of this campaign is to completely fund the release of Yottapocalypse—Level One: Installation, the first 120-page tankōbon. Every contribution we receive is guaranteed a digital, high-quality PDF of the complete book in digital format when it is complete. However, we will run this campaign progressively, meaning that as contributions roll in, we will use the money to distribute digital chapters of the book as it is made at certain perk levels. Fans and contributors will be brought aboard the journey, from storyboard-to-printed-page as the book is made, granting them early access to a wide variety of insider content, Indiegogo exclusive artwork and creator's  blog.The softcover graphic novel will be printed by the good folks over at PrintNinja, regular printers of OEL with an extensive client list. (www.printninja.com)Any apparel we produce will be handled by the wildly successful, indie upstart Threadbird, geniuses who make quality printing at lower quantities a reality. (www.threadbird.com)Any paper-based merchandise we produce such as bookmarks, posters, pamphlets or scrolls will be done through the eco-friendly crew over at PrintLeaf, who offer environmentally-safe and recycled paper products for virtually any paper-based need. (www.printleaf.com)You Give, You GetStarry Sky Entertainment acknowledges just how much of a big deal it is that you contribute to not only making our dream a reality, but making OEL history in the process.

<h2>The Story</h2>
<p> Dominic Lombardi, aka Dragon Fly, gets sucked into the criminal underworld of Baltimore when he has a chance encounter with a charismatic jazz singer named Cana. Dominic can't help to be smitten when they first meet but soon finds out the club Cana performs at is run by the local mafia that were responsible for the death of his father. The Cusanelli mob has hired a gang of dirt bikers to retrieve and bring them a mysterious metallic box. The bikers shoot up the city streets in the process and to complicate matters further, two special agents from a secret military program are after Dom and the Dragon Fly armor. Dominic has long been anticipating the day he can bring down mob boss Atano Cusanelli and free Baltimore of his criminal empire. Could that time be now or is he unprepared for a battle of this magnitude?</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>GREAT NEWS! BOOK ONE is complete, in the bag! You're essentially contributing to first print run! There will be no need to wait a year for your copy! Imagine that? Back it today and by March of 2021 and beyond you'll receive your copy of the Ghetto Dragon Book 1: No Good Deed. Where can you go wrong?</p>
<p>Another upside to this campaign, there is no set goal, meaning that whomever backs a perk, you WILL receive your copy of the Ghetto Dragon NO MATTER WHAT! It's a win-win for everyone involved as it should be.</p>
<p>As a bonus, if you help me reach the stretch goal of 5k, I'll be able to add goodies to the perks for ALL backers (yes, this includes those who backed the PDF perk or donated to the campaign) as a token of my gratitude:</p>
<p>5k+ will help me produce extra small goodies like stickers, and prints of the covers by Kim Jacinto and Steven Seven, plus other goodies that may arise if you help me reach this goal.</p>
<p>10k+ and beyond. Damn! I wouldn't know what to add at that point. I would be forever grateful if that were to happen and definitely would think of producing  something worthwhile for all of you!</p>
<p>Overall, no matter what I end up with I will forever be grateful to you, the reader for helping make my dreams of being a published comics writer a reality!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Customer satisfaction is my top priority.</p>
<p>I plan on delivering the product I offer you here today in a timely manner as well as in pristine condition. That's a guarantee.</p>
<p>Given that this is my second attempt at crowdfunding, I learned a lot about my first failed campaign. This has left a great impact on my understanding of what crowdfunding is and how it should never be taken lightly. I fully understand that I'm selling a product to you, the reader and contributor, and you deserve every bit of respect for believing in my me as a creator of a comic book story. Now, armed with the new information I've acquired, I'm ready and willing to step up to the plate to take my chance to swing the bat to hit the ball out of the park.</p>
<p>Help me get there!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk I face is brand recognition as well as distribution. Not many people know of my work or of my struggles to get one of my comic book projects published, let alone distributed to you. Now, it's my chance to show you what kind of skills I possess as a comic book writer as well as a publisher and distributor. At the moment, I am a one man team, but I do have volunteers ready to and willing to help me fulfill this campaign.</p>
<p>Make no mistake that this is a business venture and reputation is everything in the comic book game. Trust is a major factor for customer loyalty and I hope that this campaign proves my worth that I belong among the long list of creators who have delivered to their fans in the age of crowdfunding campaigns.</p>
<p>The road up ahead will be tough and ardous, but I'm ready to face the obstacle head on!</p>

</h3> <p></p>
<ul><li>The short answer? 

</li></ul>
<p>Because it’s a one of a kind page turner.</p>
<ul><li>The long answer? </li></ul>
<p>I'm a father with a thirteen year old son named Devante. Devante loves
comics, superheroes and video games. He's my heart and truth be told it’s an
honor to run SILVERBACK COMICS with him. </p>
<p>They was a moment in time where I had 2 loves of my life before my son
Devante there was my daughter Aaliyah <i><b>(For who the Golden Kingdom in the story is named after)</b></i> I loved her more than life itself and she
was the first one to ever hear the tale of ATLEA. When she passed away my world
ended and so did this story that I am now so proud of today!  I want my story, her story “OUR STORY” to live
on! For every page of this story that I write and illustrate I think of my baby
girl and that’s why ATLEA. </p>
<p>So I took all of the characters I read to her every night and put them in
one drama driven world full of new off the wall situations. It's a mash-up of the
goodie two
shoes fairy tale characters we all grew up knowing and your typical
Daytime Drama on CBS</p>
<p>Another reason for ATLEA to exist is that I wanted to give my son a chance
to be a part of his sister’s legacy.  I
wanted him to have a hand in always keeping her spirit and smile alive</p>
<p>That's my WHY for ATLEA. I'm hoping it resonates with
you and you'll give us a chance.</p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>The risks are pretty low. I've run one previous successful indiegogo
campaign (HELL &amp; HOLY WATER #1) with 100% of backer rewards being
fulfilled.</p>
<p>The only challenge was actually a lot of fun and that was
finding ways for all the characters to intertwine with each other in some way
shape or form.</p>
<p>Should an unforeseen obstacle arise (which would have to be
like ARMAGEDDON since there's no other reason to not fulfill pledges) every
possible action within my power will be taken to make sure backers get their
rewards!</p>

A lotus blossom drifted down to rest on the frozen battlefield. Kido's breath looked like billowing smoke as he awaited at the forefront of the remaining defenders. His head was bloodied but unbowed. 

The attackers did not fear death. They charged without thought - or armor - into walls of thrusting spears, and continued their raging assault even as their lifeblood soaked the frozen ground. He had never seen anything like these Vikings. The Satsuma Shogun had fallen without their neighbors knowledge, and at first word, their rivals had considered it a blessing. It was not so. 


Kido knew that should he survive, and the Vikings be driven back, he must learn the secret to their sublime, un-heeding rage. A rage born of something so primal that all else fades behind a haze of single-minded purpose.

Baransu is an epic story following the life of Kido Nobuyasu - a troubled samurai warrior who wants nothing more than to find peace, but can't seem to find it. 


With the Vikings invading Japan, the clash between these two warrior cultures creates a great deal of turmoil in the mind of Kido Nobuyasu. There is wisdom in both cultures that we are excited to share. 




Writer: Kimball Coffin


Artist: Sebastián Piriz



This story is intended to be a prequel to a video game sharing the name Baransu - that picks up where the story leaves off, allowing readers to assume the role of Kido Nobuyasu as he attempts to bring balance to his life through violent and vengeful means. 


What We Need & What You Get
We will be using a web based development tool to make this into a motion comic with music and sound effects. Each month, we will do our best to release a chapter with 4-8 pages of awesome moving art over the course of one year. At the end of the year, funding and development of the Baransu game will begin and the story will continue from the player's perspective. 



The funding will go toward development expenses, and paying Sebastián for his epic artwork. Backers will be given a link to the comic as soon as the first chapter is available.

<br/><h2>
<b>What is the premise of the story?</b><br/>
</h2>
<p>In <b>Purge: Past Unspoken,</b> Purge comes face to face with his questionable
 past and the hidden truths that lie within the city he protects.  
Overwhelming odds mount, when a genetic agent is created with the 
potential to eliminate two tenths of the world's population.   With the 
fate of the world at stake, and a clandestine group bent on his demise, 
unsavory alliances are forged that will forever challenge his beliefs of
 what it means to be a hero.<br/></p>
<h2>
<b>Who is Purge?</b>
</h2>
<p><b>Purge aka Richard Kincaid </b>encompasses
everything his name stands for....<b>Purification</b>.  Purification of the city he helped
create and the near endless struggles he faces within.

PURGE: PAST UNSPOKEN ISSUE ONE


What is the premise of the story?

In Purge: Past Unspoken, Purge comes face to face with his questionable
 past and the hidden truths that lie within the city he protects.  
Overwhelming odds mount, when a genetic agent is created with the 
potential to eliminate two tenths of the world's population.   With the 
fate of the world at stake, and a clandestine group bent on his demise, 
unsavory alliances are forged that will forever challenge his beliefs of
 what it means to be a hero.

Who is Purge?

Purge aka Richard Kincaid encompasses
everything his name stands for....Purification.  Purification of the city he helped
create and the near endless struggles he faces within.



As a youth, Richard was abducted and subjected to experimentation 
involving lobotomy and surgical implementation that left him in a state 
of near retardation. 


As years pass, he recovered with heighten senses, and the ability 
to control his bodily functions to increase his strength, agility and 
memory.  
  


His love for all things tech, led him to create one of the 
largest technological firms in the world.  His philosophy, “ Build to teach, and teach to build.""  As one of the leading and most prolific
corporate leaders of the world, Richard understood the importance of
creating an environment for success and prosperity through solidarity.Together with numerous world leaders he ushered in the world's first mecha city, New Salem.  A city where technology grows at an alarming rate. 

 Purge struggles to protect, contain the growth of New Salem, and to come to terms 
with his past, that has been hidden from him by the very technology that 
made him who he is today.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We’ll use every tool in the comics kit, including humor — a staple of Jewish tradition — to make even the most esoteric and/or non-linear sections engaging, as we bring history alive, making it relevant with the action, drama and excitement that’s always been inherent.</span><br/></p>

<p></p>
<h3><b>How Is This <i>Haggadah</i> Different from All Other <i>Haggadot</i>?</b></h3>
<p>The majority of <i>Haggadot </i>(plural for <i>Haggadahs)</i> on the market are straightforward treatments emphasizing text and commentary.  Amidst the myriad varieties — which includes no-frills giveaways, organizational editions, coffee table versions, and 60- or even 30-minute abridgments — there is no graphic novel adaptation. </p>
<p>There are many illustrated <i>Haggadot</i>. They range from illustrated manuscripts — some dating back decades and even centuries — to children’s storybooks. They place illustrations or photographs next to the text. But they do not <i>fully illustrate</i> the text — whereas our graphic novel will fuse words and text together into sequential storytelling. </p>
<p>
Is the graphic novel an appropriate medium for such reverential material? Absolutely! (What were hieroglyphics if not ancient comics?) In modern times, Jews practically invented the comic book. Telling the Passover story in sequential art is a
natural: What is described or implied by the original text will be illustrated verbatim, and dialogue spoken by historical figures will be spoken via word balloons.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461639167/PHGN_dialogue3_nfceln.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>In this way, <i>The </i><i>Passover Haggadah</i> <i>Graphic Novel</i> will resonate with people of all backgrounds, religious affiliations and demographics, regardless of how much Hebrew they know or tradition they observe, and appeal to the casual buyer and collector alike. <p></p>
<p>To borrow from the <i>Haggadah’s</i> parable of the Four Sons —  Four <i>Children</i>:<i> </i>whether you’re “wise” and knowledgeable from birth, or “simple” and want the basics, <i>The </i><i>Passover Haggadah <i>Graphic Novel</i> </i>will play a central role in guiding you from slavery to freedom authentically and entertainingly.</p>
<p>Our research with experts in the publishing field indicates that schools, libraries and Jewish institutions will be interested in procuring multiple copies. This book will be an evergreen product that will sell year after year, for educational, theological and ecumenical use, for personal enjoyment, and as a treasured gift.</p>
<p>In sum: we’re creating the first and only fully functional, artistically stunning, modern yet timeless, educational and entertaining graphic novel for the authentic ritual observance of the Passover Seder. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">(Matzoh sold separately.)</span></p>

</div></div>","The title says it all: The Passover Haggadah Graphic Novel.  
Hebrew and transliteration on the right; comics and English translation on the left. 
Everyone who hears the concept immediately gets it — and loves it.
About the Project
The Passover Haggadah Graphic Novel  will be a beautiful and functional full-length graphic novel version of the traditional Passover Seder table “guide book” that is both dynamic and accessible, combining:
• Unabridged (i.e., fully kosher) Hebrew text and transliteration;
• Fully illustrated graphic novel incorporating unabridged, brand new, modern, colloquial English translation;
• “How To” instructional graphics depicting rituals and customs
The text of The Passover Haggadah Graphic Novel is like a ""SparkNotes"" of Judaism: a sprawling, anachronistic overview of the entirety of Jewish heritage and experience, sampled from 4,000 years of scholarship and philosophy, suffering and success — sometimes all on the same page! — with a festive
meal in the middle.

Icons placed in the margins will help you mark your place when you have to get up and go to the kitchen to check on the brisket. Big moments like the Ten Plagues will feature spreads. And the long, dense later sections will feature thematically linked stories to keep the participant involved through the end. 


We’ll use every tool in the comics kit, including humor — a staple of Jewish tradition — to make even the most esoteric and/or non-linear sections engaging, as we bring history alive, making it relevant with the action, drama and excitement that’s always been inherent.


How Is This Haggadah Different from All Other Haggadot?
The majority of Haggadot (plural for Haggadahs) on the market are straightforward treatments emphasizing text and commentary.  Amidst the myriad varieties — which includes no-frills giveaways, organizational editions, coffee table versions, and 60- or even 30-minute abridgments — there is no graphic novel adaptation. 
There are many illustrated Haggadot. They range from illustrated manuscripts — some dating back decades and even centuries — to children’s storybooks. They place illustrations or photographs next to the text. But they do not fully illustrate the text — whereas our graphic novel will fuse words and text together into sequential storytelling. 

Is the graphic novel an appropriate medium for such reverential material? Absolutely! (What were hieroglyphics if not ancient comics?) In modern times, Jews practically invented the comic book. Telling the Passover story in sequential art is a
natural: What is described or implied by the original text will be illustrated verbatim, and dialogue spoken by historical figures will be spoken via word balloons.



In this way, The Passover Haggadah Graphic Novel will resonate with people of all backgrounds, religious affiliations and demographics, regardless of how much Hebrew they know or tradition they observe, and appeal to the casual buyer and collector alike. 
To borrow from the Haggadah’s parable of the Four Sons —  Four Children: whether you’re “wise” and knowledgeable from birth, or “simple” and want the basics, The Passover Haggadah Graphic Novel will play a central role in guiding you from slavery to freedom authentically and entertainingly.
Our research with experts in the publishing field indicates that schools, libraries and Jewish institutions will be interested in procuring multiple copies. This book will be an evergreen product that will sell year after year, for educational, theological and ecumenical use, for personal enjoyment, and as a treasured gift.
In sum: we’re creating the first and only fully functional, artistically stunning, modern yet timeless, educational and entertaining graphic novel for the authentic ritual observance of the Passover Seder. (Matzoh sold separately.)
The Team Behind The Passover Haggadah Graphic Novel


I'm Jordan B. Gorfinkel, known as Gorf. Having managed
the Batman franchise at DC Comics, I am blessed to be one of the unique few in the world with the highest
possible level of graphic novel creation and production experience. My
creations, such as Batman: No Man’s
Land and Birds Of Prey, have
resulted in critically acclaimed and commercially successful comics (more than
2000 publications), film (The Dark Knight
Rises), television series (Cartoon Network, The WB), toys, games,
merchandise and more. 

I love comics and Judaism (in alphabetical order). I practice Judaism as a Torah observant Jew, and I’ve both learned and taught Judaism from and in all major Jewish denominations. As a
kid attending Jewish day schools and Ramah and Moshava sleepaway camps, I
doodled Batman on lots of desks and bunk walls. Little wonder that today, I apply my professional Batman storytelling skills to producing mainstream and Jewish
content, including illustrated storytelling, music, TV/film, and, of course, comics, such as my weekly
cartoon strip JewishCartoon.com.


So: why a Haggadah? I recall when the Munich Jewish Museum contacted me to commission a series of my JewishCartoon.com comic strips on the Holocaust for their permanent exhibition, complete with humorous punchlines… The Holocaust! Initially I considered turning them down. What if I screwed it up? Then I realized, if I don’t undertake it, someone else might screw it up!

Adapting the non-linear Passover Haggadah story into comics will be the greatest challenge and most joyous achievement of my career — and one that I believe will have lasting impact.For The Passover Haggadah Graphic Novel, I’ve commissioned an original, easy-to-follow and immensely readable translation from David Olivestone. Beloved as  the editor and translator of the immensely popular NCSY Bencher (Grace After Meals Book), he has a proven ability to bring the text alive by finding just the right English word or phrase to fit the Hebrew idiom. Recently retired from his position as Senior Communications Officer at the Orthodox Union in New York, David now lives in Jerusalem.
It took me several
months of global networking to identify the best young Israeli comics talent to
draw the Haggadah.  Erez Zadok is a graduate of the renowned
Bezalel Academy of Art in Jerusalem. He is a Godsend! His immense talent,
devotion to his craft and tireless work ethic need no further introduction
than his evocative artwork for this Haggadah.


Rounding out our
team are accomplished project managers, designers and publicists.

<p>On the strange world of M'yltos, a race of techno-organic creatures rule a portion of the planet.  They are called the Techno-Mechs.  The ruler of the Techno-Mechs, Shiandra, is constantly granting herself more and more power against the wishes of the race's council.  Another large portion of the planet's population are a race of rock people called the Stone Warriors.  The two races are separated by a large ocean of lava.  Shiandra plays into the xenophobia of the Techno-Mechs and has declared the Stone Warriors an enemy of the state.</p>
<p>A group of renegade freedom fighters called the Apostates risk their freedom and very lives to smuggle the Stone Warriors into the city state Command Star-1.  The Stone Warriors are ruled by an evil dictator who causes warrior rights atrocities. The Apostates are sympathetic to the Stone Warriors problems and believe the Warriors can have better lives in Command Star-1.</p>
<p>Shiandra has erected a wall that she believes will help to prevent the immigration of the Stone Warriors.  She has dispatched her elite guard, the Wardens, to patrol the wall and keep the citizens of Command Star-1 safe.  The leader of the Wardens, Solitaire, is very loyal to Shiandra.  He and his two top Wardens, Vyper and his brother, Rozzik, have uncovered a plot to overthrow Shiandra. </p>
<p>During a battle between the Wardens and the Apostates, Vyper is gravely injured saving the life of Solitaire.  While Vyper is recovering he investigates the Apostates and learns that the leader of the Apostates, Pandemonium, is taking her orders from a member of the Wardens!  This news will send ripples throughout the Techno-Mechs, even reaching the leader Shiandra herself!</p>

On the strange world of M'yltos, a race of techno-organic creatures rule a portion of the planet.  They are called the Techno-Mechs.  The ruler of the Techno-Mechs, Shiandra, is constantly granting herself more and more power against the wishes of the race's council.  Another large portion of the planet's population are a race of rock people called the Stone Warriors.  The two races are separated by a large ocean of lava.  Shiandra plays into the xenophobia of the Techno-Mechs and has declared the Stone Warriors an enemy of the state.
A group of renegade freedom fighters called the Apostates risk their freedom and very lives to smuggle the Stone Warriors into the city state Command Star-1.  The Stone Warriors are ruled by an evil dictator who causes warrior rights atrocities. The Apostates are sympathetic to the Stone Warriors problems and believe the Warriors can have better lives in Command Star-1.
Shiandra has erected a wall that she believes will help to prevent the immigration of the Stone Warriors.  She has dispatched her elite guard, the Wardens, to patrol the wall and keep the citizens of Command Star-1 safe.  The leader of the Wardens, Solitaire, is very loyal to Shiandra.  He and his two top Wardens, Vyper and his brother, Rozzik, have uncovered a plot to overthrow Shiandra. 
During a battle between the Wardens and the Apostates, Vyper is gravely injured saving the life of Solitaire.  While Vyper is recovering he investigates the Apostates and learns that the leader of the Apostates, Pandemonium, is taking her orders from a member of the Wardens!  This news will send ripples throughout the Techno-Mechs, even reaching the leader Shiandra herself!

<h3>A dark Sci-Fi saga</h3>
<p>In the year 2179 an epic journey unfolds.</p>
<p>Zithara, an alien hybrid, has hollow bones and the ability to form red crystal structures at will into various forms of weaponry, thus allowing her to become an acrobatic blade of death. She comes face to face with a pack of horrible mutant abominations, awful life devouring beasts dubbed as Dreadfiends.</p>
<p>As she fights for her life to escape from being eaten alive by them, she remembers her past horrors, a dark childhood bathed in pure hatred and prejudice simply for being what she is. She is hunted down by the technologically advanced and militant trained hate group known as The Order of the Purging Hand. This hate causes her to embark on a journey that unlocks her true potential...</p>
<p>And leads her to join a ragtag super team called The Crimson Flame.</p>
<p>The Dreadfiends have grown and spread at such a rapid rate that they have become a plague that threatens the very existence of humankind and most of all other life on earth. The Crimson Flame is humanity's last hope, but a genocidal dark entity that calls himself Malakar is determined to make any hope impossible.</p>

<h3>The Mind behind the madness</h3>
<p>My name is Scott Payne. I have been a huge comic book fanatic for most of my life. I've wanted to be a comic book creator ever since I can remember, but I've always felt that if I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it BIG.</p>
<p>So I have been building on this story and world for 20 years now and I'm finally ready to share it with comic book fans all over. Chaotic Flux is a passion of mine and that I want nothing more than to get it into reader's hands.</p>
<p>I love stories such as X-Men: Age of Apocalypse, WATCHMEN, Avengers, Battle Chasers, Evangelion, Battle Angel: Alita, Game of Thrones, Batman Returns, Guild Wars 2, and Resident Evil. The drama, high stakes, and larger than life feel of these stories is what you will get from Chaotic Flux.</p>

<p>My biggest dream is for this series is to share it with as many people as possible. I truly believe this is a story worth telling and sharing.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for $6000.</p>
<p>This is to cover the cost of paying the talented artists that made Chaotic Flux #1, which is more than half of what we are asking for. As the comic is already finished, the rest of the $6000 goes towards printing 1250 copies of the non-metallic version of the book as well as making all of these additional awesome rewards, and shipping them all out to you.</p>
<p>Any money raised beyond the set goal will go on to help fund additional issues in the Chaotic Flux series. Issue #2 is in the works now.</p>

</div></div>","A dark Sci-Fi saga
In the year 2179 an epic journey unfolds.
Zithara, an alien hybrid, has hollow bones and the ability to form red crystal structures at will into various forms of weaponry, thus allowing her to become an acrobatic blade of death. She comes face to face with a pack of horrible mutant abominations, awful life devouring beasts dubbed as Dreadfiends.
As she fights for her life to escape from being eaten alive by them, she remembers her past horrors, a dark childhood bathed in pure hatred and prejudice simply for being what she is. She is hunted down by the technologically advanced and militant trained hate group known as The Order of the Purging Hand. This hate causes her to embark on a journey that unlocks her true potential...
And leads her to join a ragtag super team called The Crimson Flame.
The Dreadfiends have grown and spread at such a rapid rate that they have become a plague that threatens the very existence of humankind and most of all other life on earth. The Crimson Flame is humanity's last hope, but a genocidal dark entity that calls himself Malakar is determined to make any hope impossible.
Go to SharpEdgeComics.com, my production company, for even more on the series.
Including a full 10 page preview. Chaotic Flux #1 is 26 pages long. Plus 2 pages of extras.
 

 





 
The Mind behind the madness
My name is Scott Payne. I have been a huge comic book fanatic for most of my life. I've wanted to be a comic book creator ever since I can remember, but I've always felt that if I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it BIG.
So I have been building on this story and world for 20 years now and I'm finally ready to share it with comic book fans all over. Chaotic Flux is a passion of mine and that I want nothing more than to get it into reader's hands.
I love stories such as X-Men: Age of Apocalypse, WATCHMEN, Avengers, Battle Chasers, Evangelion, Battle Angel: Alita, Game of Thrones, Batman Returns, Guild Wars 2, and Resident Evil. The drama, high stakes, and larger than life feel of these stories is what you will get from Chaotic Flux.

<p>I came up with the idea for my abstract comic ""Blackberry Cheers"" after spending 2 years drawing my first graphic novel Lobster Paradise.

If you like the project, but don't have the opportunity to contribute, you can still help spread the word out and share this campaign through your social media platforms, I'll be more than grateful.
Thanks for reading, Edo.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The story of BREATHERS follows a small cast of individuals as they struggle to make sense of the dystopian world they live in, as a virus is unleashed into the air, rendering it deadly to humans. Among them: a detective whose addiction to the drug known as ""Filter K"" takes over his life; a brother and sister who, due to recent events, start to wonder if the air really is deadly, or if it's all just a conspiracy; a mother and daughter who will do anything to keep their family together; and a breather salesman who is looking to make amends for his past mistakes.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Steven Sweeney. I have written a sci-fi horror crime comic book series called 'The Brink'. </p>
<p>The Brink issue #1 is a 24 page black and white comic in high contrast art with cover by Marcelo Simonetti. All the art work is complete and the issue is complete.</p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to help fund a print run. I am committed to continue the story so I'm looking for that leg up to get the ball rolling at comic conventions and online sales.</p>
<p>The Brink is a dark sc-fi, horror, crime comic book series, set in London in the UK. It's about Detective Inspector Sally Shivers and Detective Sergeant Cameron Beckett who investigate crimes of an unearthly nature.</p>
<p>SHIVERS explains, 'our bosses don't like investigations that remain sketchy or unexplained. it messes with the figures and implies incompetence. They are classified as brink cases.'</p>
<p>BECKETT asks, 'you’re assigned these types of cases?'</p>
<p>SHIVERS replies, 'we both are now.'</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536348208/ktqsssjhcliybfa6hrq4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>DI Sally Shivers heads up the Fringe Services Division (FSD), a unique investigative unit that was set up by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) following an official independent review into the way police carry out investigations into certain crimes. The report identified police failings in cases of a unexplained or abnormal nature.</p>
<p>DS Cameron Beckett is hand-picked by the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police to work with Shivers. Beckett has been briefed to challenge Shivers and demystify the cases they deal with.</p>
<p>During issue #1 Beckett is continually shocked and surprised by events, but more so by Shivers who is a total face-smashing, Glock-wielding bad-ass. She secretly possesses powers that she cannot control and you see early on that her struggle with heroin addiction could end up being a HUGE problem... </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm keeping this simple, the target is $750 for this campaign. What does that cover? First and foremost that gets this book printed and in your hands. Anything beyond the cost of printing and shipping the comic book goes right into issue number two!</p>
<p>In issue one you get a 24-page story that begins with the murder of a young girl. She has her spine torn out by an unnamed creature. The case is referred to the FSD.. Issue #1 is the start of an ongoing series of comics telling the unfolding circumstances around the story.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<h3>THIS CAMPAIGN IS FOR BOOK TWO (book 1 also offered)</h3>
<p>Blast off and explore a wild and wacky galaxy with Alex and Maddison, two grandkids that discover their Navy Veteran grandfather was really a space explorer for the military. Marooned decades in the past and across the vast cosmos, the kids and their young grandfather must fight against ravenous creatures and sinister aliens while searching for powerful elements that will lead them home.</p>

<h3>WHAT'S BETWEEN THE LINES</h3>
<p>The Galactic Comet is an exciting kids storybook, perfect for bedtime or just to escape into fantasy for a while. The story promotes family values; highlighting the respect for elders and taking an interest in their wealth of knowledge and experience. For a child, holding a book and delving into the adventure within is a great imaginative and tactile exercise. That connection is priceless. With this story it's my hope to help strengthen family bonds and inspire children's imaginations.</p>

<h2>About the Author and the Storybook</h2>
<p>I’m a family man of over twenty years and the father of two children. I’ve spent over two decades in product development/marketing and sales. I’m an artist with nearly thirty years’ experience in animation, special effects, 3D design and dubious voice-over work. I enjoy the creative process and developing projects to their completion.</p>
<p>When my Navy veteran grandfather reached the last years of his life, I visited him and learned more about his incredible life. After he passed, I created a eulogy and poured over 94 years of his life in pictures. It was amazing. Sometimes we don't get to say goodbye to the ones we love, but the time you spent with them is invaluable. Though a kids science fiction fantasy storybook, The Galactic Comet is a tale of two kids learning about their grandfather in ways they never knew and appreciating the man that he is. There's so much more to the people close to us if we only take the time to listen.</p>
<p>Joining in this endeavor allows independent creators to produce art in true free-form. Devoid from corporate thinking and massively funded agendas, stories here can be told with passion and energy. It’s truly exciting when people can come together and be a part of creating something fresh and exciting.</p>

</div></div>","THIS CAMPAIGN IS FOR BOOK TWO (book 1 also offered)
Blast off and explore a wild and wacky galaxy with Alex and Maddison, two grandkids that discover their Navy Veteran grandfather was really a space explorer for the military. Marooned decades in the past and across the vast cosmos, the kids and their young grandfather must fight against ravenous creatures and sinister aliens while searching for powerful elements that will lead them home.

WHAT'S BETWEEN THE LINES
The Galactic Comet is an exciting kids storybook, perfect for bedtime or just to escape into fantasy for a while. The story promotes family values; highlighting the respect for elders and taking an interest in their wealth of knowledge and experience. For a child, holding a book and delving into the adventure within is a great imaginative and tactile exercise. That connection is priceless. With this story it's my hope to help strengthen family bonds and inspire children's imaginations.

I am the artist and writer of the series Pinkwing And The Prime-Controller.
I'm running this campaign to get books into the hands of interested readers.
This campaign is for the 4 issue origin story arc ""Battle-Tested"".
Pinkwing and Prime Controller #1-4 captures the origin story of Ruby and Duncan Pryce and how they become Pinkwing and The Prime-Controller.  They are recruited to become defenders of the planet to fight against an alien invasion of creatures that feed on the natural resources of a planet.

The Cast-

Ruby and Duncan Pryce
Duncan Pryce aka The Prime-Controller- The 13 year older brother to Ruby. He is a young tech savvy kid very interested in building things.  As Prime-Controller he has access to the Nexus-Gauntlet, and he gains knowledge of an intergalactic understanding of physics. The gauntlet delivers a devastating blow upon impact and generates a power suit that makes the person encased near invulnerable.
Ruby Pryce aka Pinkwing-The 10 year old sister to Duncan. She is a history buff of all things related to martial arts   Ruby picked up the Unbroken Staff.  It also generates a power suit that makes her near invulnerable.  It grants her abnormal speed, leaping abilities and access to the Warriors Vault, an intergalactic fighters guide.

The more matter it absorbs the more intelligent and evolved the creatures will be. The actual drone is the unit that controls the creatures. These Drones are sent to planets as a weapons of mass destruction as it salvages natural resources to power its core to create creatures.

I started to get cartoons published and moved to Montreal in the early ‘90s,
where I was part of the underground comix scene. After university I travelled
to India a few times and became a teacher… I missed comics and made a return to
the Toronto zine scene in the early 2000’s.  However, a stint in architecture
school completely burned me out, and it took my old publisher from
Montreal, <b>Editions TRIP Comix</b> to convince me I was still a
contender.  I returned to graphic novels in 2012, and made books 1-4
of <i>THE CLIFF</i> saga, feeling the fire burning again.</p>
<p>This is really my
passion.  I’ve got a lot of ground to cover—it’s a different world than
when I started—graphic novels are finally being recognized for the expressive
medium they are.  I’ve got myself back up to speed and beyond where I was,
and I’ve got a lot to share.</p>
<p>There was a break for me
to return to architecture school and complete my Master’s of Architecture
degree as a graphic novel called <i>ARCHITECTURE DEPARTMENT</i> at
the end of 2015…  actually, it's a prequel to <i>THE CLIFF</i>! I've
gotten it completed, which was no small task—99 pages of artwork + 9 pages of
research notes—now I know I can do it!  And I've got to go on.</p>
<p>My skills honed and my
heart is racing—to answer all the questions about <b>Mutt Blue</b>’s quest
for meaning which began in <i>THE CLIFF</i> Books 1-4—his
apprenticeship under the weird cult icon/private detective <b>Poopsie the
Penguin</b>—and Mutt’s penchant for poor romantic choices… as he travels to
meet the bearded bureaucrat who runs the universe: “<i>The King,”</i> in
this final chapter <i>THE CLIFF</i>. </p>
<p>The graphic novel is an
important medium… a unique combination of words and images with its own
language—but it is not yet available to everyone.  I’d like to bring in
the comics I loved so much growing up—Charles Schulz’s <i>Peanuts</i>,
Frank Miller’s <i>Ronin</i>, Moebius’ <i>Airtight Garage, </i>and
the brilliant work of Chester Brown, Robert Crumb and Art Spiegelman and more…
but I’d also like to bring in the worlds of painting, architecture, literature,
spirituality and psychology to the comics I make.  One day, I’d like to
start an educational project bringing graphic novels, all their heritage and
potential, to the greater world.</p>
<p>For now, if I could
combine the passion and the job into one thing: making comics, then my dream
would come true.  And you will have a nice graphic novel to hold in your
hands—something like you’ve never seen before!</p>

<h3>The Styx</h3>
<p>My name is AlanaRae VG I am a senior at Southwest University of Visual Arts in Albuquerque, NM. I am focusing my degree of Illustration on Comic Books and Sequential art. I came up with the graphic novel ""The Styx"" After my grandfather passed away from aggressive cancer shortly after I had a breast cancer scare of my own. This prompted me to question what comes after death, or what the process of dying does to the people around them. </p>
<p>I created a story in which an 8 year old boy named Wit Mortimer falls into coma after being diagnosed with cancer. He has to meet up with a parent like spirit named Charon while they cross the RIVER STYX to get the mysterious door on the other side. Wit learns to stand up and fight on his own, while Charon learns when it's time to let go.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am looking to raise money for printing and distribution costs, I am offering some awesome perks to go along with your donations, they range from character sheets all the way to you named as a producer in the book!

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Diseases are heart shaking and impossible to understand. Living with something that impairs your day to day normal life is hard. Understanding death and what it means may be even harder.

<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>The first purpose of this campaign is to raise money to help fund the launch of Graphic Contents a brand new subscription club exclusively for indie, creator owned and small press comics in exchange for this you will receive early access and comic book rewards! </p>
<p>The second goal of this campaign is to find like minded people for collaboration, creators, fans, publishers we need and want your input and support.</p>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hi i'm Louis Harris I've been a comic book reader, fan &amp; collector for over 25 years, I started out like most British kids reading stories about Dennis The Menace &amp; Desperate Dan in The Beano &amp; Dandy from there I moved on to American comics from Marvel &amp; DC where I would go into the city to the comic book shops and would be amazed by all the different stories I remember the first time I walked in and saw a Death Of Superman TPB and thought ""How can Superman die!"" I was hooked...</p>
<p>From there I read everything I could get my hands of mostly staying within the confides of characters I knew from the big two, I had been reading for a few years and would spend Saturday mornings going through the discount longboxes at the comic shop to get the most amount of comics as possible with my pocket money, thats where I discovered Image, Vertigo (although a DC imprint had a very indie (and British) vibe in the 90s), Dark Horse and indie comics.</p>
<p>Since then i've always sought out indie comics and graphic novels, as I grew older I became bored with the comics from the big two and now exclusively read indie and creator owned comics. </p>
<p>So I'm launching Graphic Contents to help others discover comics that are new and different, for some getting to a comic shop is difficult because of distance or accessibility, Graphic Contents will also save time by bringing you the best indie comics has to offer each month as well as providing members great value through group buying and passing on the savings.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>So what will you get every month? </p>
<p>5-7 Comics or Graphic Novels/TPBs which will always be from creator owned, small press &amp; indie publishers.</p>
<p>All comics will always be 1st issues (volumes for OGN/TPB), one shots or at the start of a story arc which is a good jumping on point we won't send you books in the middle of a story, ever. </p>
<p>We will also include bonus items including comic book and geek related trading cards (vintage &amp; modern), Variant Issues, Zines, Stickers, Posters, Keyrings,  Bookmarks, Posters, Toys etc obviously this will be dependent on how much we can raise and how many members we have, the more members we get the greater the buying power so the better the bonus items will be! </p>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>We have perks to suit every budget from $20 to try us out for a month to $11,111 for a lifetime subscription!</p>
<p>The first box is guaranteed to have at least 2 full graphic novels/TPBs and the retail value will greatly exceed the cost.</p>
<p>We are starting with shipping being offered to USA &amp; UK but if you are from another country and are interested in pledging just pop me an email Louis@GraphicContents.co.uk and we'll add shipping options/perk for your country.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What we need &amp; overfunding goals</h3>
<p>The money raised will go towards web design and the cost of the boxes, items included.</p>
<p>If the campaign exceeds its goals then we would like the overspend to go towards review boxes for bloggers &amp; press (because the faster we grow the better we will be for our members), custom boxes, signed items, variants, digital downloads, </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Graphic Contents will create another outlet for indie creators to get their work out there, be seen &amp; to sell comic books and actually make a living doing what they love! </p>
<p>It will also create an outlet for fans who for whatever reason be it time or that they don't have a LCS near to them to get indie comics delivered to their door.</p>
<p>We believe in freedom of speech and expression and will be non partisan, we will allow creators of all political, idealogical or religious (or non) freedom to do what they want we will not edit or attempt to censor anyone, if you are not open to ideas, other points of view and are easily offended we recommend you don't subscribe.</p>

About Me
Hi i'm Louis Harris I've been a comic book reader, fan & collector for over 25 years, I started out like most British kids reading stories about Dennis The Menace & Desperate Dan in The Beano & Dandy from there I moved on to American comics from Marvel & DC where I would go into the city to the comic book shops and would be amazed by all the different stories I remember the first time I walked in and saw a Death Of Superman TPB and thought ""How can Superman die!""

Since then i've always sought out indie comics and graphic novels, as I grew older I became bored with the comics from the big two and now exclusively read indie and creator owned comics. 
So I'm launching Graphic Contents to help others discover comics that are new and different, for some getting to a comic shop is difficult because of distance or accessibility, Graphic Contents will also save time by bringing you the best indie comics has to offer each month as well as providing members great value through group buying and passing on the savings.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is AJ Ryder and I am excited and proud to be heading up the Samurai Cowboy campaign. If you are here you are probably a huge comic book fan just like me. I have done a lot of things (College football player, WWE wrestler, actor, writer) but nothing compares to being part of this team and executing a life long dream of making a comic.  As you can see from what I've done I have a special interest in entertaining others and we've done that so far with Samurai Cowboy.  With your help you can help entertainment continue. I know the story and there is much more the world will want to see. The story as is, is fantastic but with the experience and the great fans comments as well as my angle, this story continues to evolve to something truly special. It would mean the world to me as well as the team involved to be able to keep producing this comic.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise a minimum of 6500$ to get the first graphic novel printed. Anything over that will go towards the ultimate goal of two more graphic novels and hopefully a show or movie. </li>
<li>The perks are great because most of them we already have or (Fingers crossed) will be making. If you make a contribution to us we can be assured you get something that actually exists NOW.  We have cool perks as well such as Skype calls and limited edition things that will only be available for a limited time no matter what.</li>
<li>If we somehow do not reach our goals we will fulfill what people ordered and work on a bonus for the people who pledged for a future product.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I can't stress enough that I truly believe that this story could be told, printed, or shot over and over throughout the years. You can be part of something that you can not only have an original piece of but look back and say ""I helped that, I am part of the Samurai Cowboy Team.""  </p>
<p>This is a very tough industry and we all understand that but the team on Samurai Cowboy is filled with hard workers, creative monsters, award winners, and persistent over achievers. Our resumes alone will show you how resilient we are and if we put our mind to something it gets done, or will get close with an amazing product. The problem is money always gets in the way. We all know that we can only do so much with a limited budget.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute. We get it better than anyone. We appreciate anything even if in the form of support.  Here's are other things you can do.</p>
<p>- Post our campaign!!!!  </p>
<p>- Visit the website. Follow us.</p>
<p>-Buy a book (When you can)</p>
<p>- Give us a shout. Sometimes a nice ""Keep it up"" goes a long way. Believe me!!!</p>
</div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p><p>Thanks again so much.</p></div>","Short Summary

If you're a fan of Studio Ghibli, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Sabrina, or Pokémon, you will love exploring the world of Lampblack--a place filled with incredible creatures and fascinating magic.The story follows Mabel Aoki and Sterling Cohen, and is set in a charming early 20th century world. Mabel's immigrant family can barely scratch out a living in their backwater fishing village. When her mother loses her job, Mabel knows their only hope is in the magic they brought from the motherland. Mabel is an ink girl, born with the ability to bring anything she paints to life. It's a dangerous gift, one she is forbidden to use. But she can't put down her brush. She won't. She was born to paint, and the ink allows her to create beauty and magic out of her simple life. She will save her family with her art, whatever the cost. Sterling Cohen is Deaf, and the only heir to Caraday's largest industrial conglomerate. His father is a tyrant--in commerce and at home. But Sterling dreams of becoming a soldier, and wants desperately to abandon the family business to serve his country. Mabel will unwittingly unleash lampblack's dark magic on her world, endangering her family and her home.

E infine, quanti fumettisti sono anche musicisti e dividono il loro tempo tra chine e concerti?Nasce così l’idea di realizzare una sorta di featuring tra 11 artisti che renderanno omaggio in modo unico a tutte queste relazioni che intercorrono tra il fumetto e la musica, creando così la prima PLAYLIST a fumetti: This is PLAYLIST _______________________________ This is Playlist è un volume di 160 pagine a colori, in formato 16,8x24, nato da una collaborazione tra Amianto Comics e Lorenzo Ferrara, musicista e fumettista.Dopo il successo del crowfunding BOLIDE e 5 anni di attività nel circuito dell'autoproduzione a fumetti, Amianto Comics ha deciso di scommettere ancora una volta sul potere e l'autonomia dei lettori.Tutti gli 11 autori, elencati sotto, hanno già consegnato i loro fumetti, ma dopo un anno in cui le fiere del fumetto sono state annullate a causa della pandemia, la realizzazione dell'antologia non è per niente scontata...Infatti, This is a Playlist vedrà la luce SOLO se raggiungeremo l'obiettivo fissato di 5000€.L'unico modo per ottenere una copia di THIS IS A PLAYLIST è quello di sostenerci attraverso questo crowdfunding e di farlo entro 30 GIORNI.Se raggiungeremo il goal, il volume verrà recapitato direttamente a casa tua entro fine 2021.Ma quali sono gli autori e le storie racchiuse nella prima Playlist musicale a fumetti?__________________________ REGULAR SIZE MONSTERLA MERAVIGLIOSA FIGLIA DEL BOIAOTTOBRE 1973 - Emilio, Lindo, Giorgio e Daniele Caramella sono in pellegrinaggio con un furgoncino Alfa Romeo lungo il leggendario hippie trail.

<div>
<p>In the pristine and bountiful heart of Thunder Valley, a tribe of Indians is attempting to find their own place within the natural way. Made up of several different tribes and bands, they’ve left the reservation’s confines and attempt to live on the land as their ancestors once did. </p>
<p>The mysterious forces that swirl and pulsate in Thunder-Valley can give great gifts, but they can also spawn the most horrible creatures and tragedies imaginable. The Thunder-Beings, the spirits tasked with overseeing this rift, this churning fountain of creation, have become complacent. Their neglect of the order has left the great machine of life unattended. Energy slips out and sometimes pours into the valley. Thoughts and hopes, fears and desire gift life to evils that never knew life. Long dead gods find power.</p>
<p>The gods here are as real as the horrors and triumphs in and around Thunder-Valley. In fact, through the dreams and nightmares of the living, new gods are born everyday. One of those creatures, and tragedies, is “Vile” Clem Styles. However, this is the story of one of the lost souls that encounters him. About her uninterrupted spirit and will. Her name, people and loved onesare robbed from, her and still she fights.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div><b>Creating Vile</b></div>
<div>My name is Richard Paul Davis, or Crowsong. I'm a songwriter, composer and creator. Although I identify as Native American, I don't want this to an exclusive comicbook, or to use my heritage to sell books. I've written most of my life, and Ihave branched out into comicbooks because of my love for the medium and the stories I have to tell.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I am fortunate to have on my creative team for Vile the incredible and creative coloring and lettering skills of Carl Bolton. Though previously an amatuer inker, colorist and letterer, Carl has honed his skills via other projects and through Vile.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We also are fortunate to have the incredible talents of <b>Francis Nuguit</b>. In addition to his amazing work on Vile, he drew for the <b><a href=""http://www.dynamite.com/htmlfiles/viewProduct.html?CAT=DF-Wheel_of_Time"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>Robert Jordan ""Wheel of Time""</a></b> series and is currently working for Take-Two comics.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>For all of us, this is a labor of love. Without funds however, our goal isn't able to be realized. I have been self-funding for over a year and it is time to see if we can find community support for our project.</div>
<div><br/></div> <p></p>
<h3>What We HAVE</h3>
<div>A top-notch team of creators working on the project, and the first chapter of the comic finished. We've proven ourselves to each other and can meet deadlines, put out a great comic and be easy to deal with. This isn't a hobby, and we take creating this comic and meeting our publisher's guidelines and deadlines very seriously. Speaking of publishers...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>We HAVE one</b>. That's right. We have <b><a href=""http://www.alternacomics.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alterna Comics</a></b> on board, and Peter Simeti of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6150214/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Chair</a> fame is waiting for our finished comic to bring it to the masses. We're not just out here on a wing and a prayer hoping we can get interest. We have had great interest from several comic companies and we chose Alterna because they get it, and they know how to operate. We only need help getting off the ground. We can get the comic, and its sequel and hopefully (fingers crossed) an entire world and ongoing world in the future.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>What we need</h3>
<div>Quite frankly, we need money to pay our amazing artist and hopefully have the funds to start work on the second issue. He has bills to pay (as we all do) and to secure his skills, we want to be able to pay him as he goes for incredible art. We don't want to skimp or compromise on quality. We need to be able to get the comic printed if it's successful as well. We're shooting for 32 pages, as a first installment of a 2-part series to tell this fantasy/western tale.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What is in it for you?</h3>
<div>Well, since you don't know Vile, or us for the most part, we want to offer great artwork. Until you read the story, you don't know that it's a great story. So, we're offering some of the fantastic artwork of Vile. We don't want to do merchandise-we want to send you collectibles that you can cherish, regardless of the outcome. We're offering the comic once finished as well. We've complied, what we think, is a great package at every level for contributing to Vile.</div>
<div><h3><b>*Update*</b></h3></div>
<div><b>All Perks backed at Heroic level and above will include everything from the Bounty Hunter level.</b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>What will happen if we meet our goal, is pay to create this story. We have the ""demo"" or first chapter created to show we can do this. If we meet our funding goals we will have the entire story, both books, created. We can also say that the comic WILL see the light of day. It WILL be published. We have a contract to publish the series with Alterna Comics. We've received tremendous interest in the comic from several publishers, but we're choosing to go with Alterna. They get it, they work hard and they know their audience. In this day and age, other than Marvel and DC, companies do not pay you to create your comicbook. You have to show you have what it takes to meet deadlines and create that comicbook first. We get that. We can get this book out and to the public. We just need your help.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Sure, this part. I love honesty. I can say, with certainty, that the risk is quite low here. I know everyone likes to say that, but, we can back up that, if funded, this comic will be published. You will be able to meet me at a convention and talk to me about the comic. You will be able to download your copy once it is done. And, if we're all super boys and girls, and get other super boys and girls to contribute, we will be able to hold a physical copy of Vile in our hands. That is another goal that we can go over if we meet the funding goals, however. So, the challenges are ours to face. We must put our nose to the grindstone and finish the book, we must send it to be published and we have to get the word out. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you don't have money to send, you can send ideas. You can let others know about Vile. You can go to or call your local comics store and ask them to carry our comic. You can also go to change.org and follow something that you truly believe in.  You don't just have to contribute; you can become involved to make a change for the better in our shared world.</p>

Energy slips out and sometimes pours into the valley. Thoughts and hopes, fears and desire gift life to evils that never knew life. Long dead gods find power.
The gods here are as real as the horrors and triumphs in and around Thunder-Valley. In fact, through the dreams and nightmares of the living, new gods are born everyday. One of those creatures, and tragedies, is “Vile” Clem Styles. However, this is the story of one of the lost souls that encounters him. About her uninterrupted spirit and will. Her name, people and loved onesare robbed from, her and still she fights.


Creating Vile
My name is Richard Paul Davis, or Crowsong. I'm a songwriter, composer and creator. Although I identify as Native American, I don't want this to an exclusive comicbook, or to use my heritage to sell books. I've written most of my life, and Ihave branched out into comicbooks because of my love for the medium and the stories I have to tell.

I am fortunate to have on my creative team for Vile the incredible and creative coloring and lettering skills of Carl Bolton. Though previously an amatuer inker, colorist and letterer, Carl has honed his skills via other projects and through Vile.

We also are fortunate to have the incredible talents of Francis Nuguit. In addition to his amazing work on Vile, he drew for the Robert Jordan ""Wheel of Time"" series and is currently working for Take-Two comics.

For all of us, this is a labor of love. Without funds however, our goal isn't able to be realized. I have been self-funding for over a year and it is time to see if we can find community support for our project.
 
What We HAVE
A top-notch team of creators working on the project, and the first chapter of the comic finished. We've proven ourselves to each other and can meet deadlines, put out a great comic and be easy to deal with. This isn't a hobby, and we take creating this comic and meeting our publisher's guidelines and deadlines very seriously. Speaking of publishers...


We HAVE one. That's right. We have Alterna Comics on board, and Peter Simeti of The Chair fame is waiting for our finished comic to bring it to the masses. We're not just out here on a wing and a prayer hoping we can get interest. We have had great interest from several comic companies and we chose Alterna because they get it, and they know how to operate. We only need help getting off the ground. We can get the comic, and its sequel and hopefully (fingers crossed) an entire world and ongoing world in the future.

What we need
Quite frankly, we need money to pay our amazing artist and hopefully have the funds to start work on the second issue. He has bills to pay (as we all do) and to secure his skills, we want to be able to pay him as he goes for incredible art. We don't want to skimp or compromise on quality. We need to be able to get the comic printed if it's successful as well. We're shooting for 32 pages, as a first installment of a 2-part series to tell this fantasy/western tale.
   What is in it for you?
Well, since you don't know Vile, or us for the most part, we want to offer great artwork. Until you read the story, you don't know that it's a great story. So, we're offering some of the fantastic artwork of Vile. We don't want to do merchandise-we want to send you collectibles that you can cherish, regardless of the outcome. We're offering the comic once finished as well. We've complied, what we think, is a great package at every level for contributing to Vile.
*Update*
All Perks backed at Heroic level and above will include everything from the Bounty Hunter level.

    The Impact What will happen if we meet our goal, is pay to create this story. We have the ""demo"" or first chapter created to show we can do this. If we meet our funding goals we will have the entire story, both books, created. We can also say that the comic WILL see the light of day. It WILL be published. We have a contract to publish the series with Alterna Comics. We've received tremendous interest in the comic from several publishers, but we're choosing to go with Alterna. They get it, they work hard and they know their audience. In this day and age, other than Marvel and DC, companies do not pay you to create your comicbook. You have to show you have what it takes to meet deadlines and create that comicbook first. We get that. We can get this book out and to the public. We just need your help.

    Risks & Challenges Sure, this part. I love honesty. I can say, with certainty, that the risk is quite low here. I know everyone likes to say that, but, we can back up that, if funded, this comic will be published. You will be able to meet me at a convention and talk to me about the comic. You will be able to download your copy once it is done. And, if we're all super boys and girls, and get other super boys and girls to contribute, we will be able to hold a physical copy of Vile in our hands. That is another goal that we can go over if we meet the funding goals, however. So, the challenges are ours to face. We must put our nose to the grindstone and finish the book, we must send it to be published and we have to get the word out. 

    Other Ways You Can Help If you don't have money to send, you can send ideas. You can let others know about Vile. You can go to or call your local comics store and ask them to carry our comic. You can also go to change.org and follow something that you truly believe in.  You don't just have to contribute; you can become involved to make a change for the better in our shared world.

Diablo
is
one
bad-ass
dude
that
is
armed
to
the
teeth
with
his
scythe
guitar
and
punk
rock
guns
killing
in
style with his loyal dog, Rockabella. As the
number one assassin for the
Demon
Clan,
he's
got
99,999
heads
to
prove
it.
He
can
smoke
a
joint
in
one
puff,
drain
a
beer
bottle
in one gulp, and talk trash better than anyone. When he gets going, his blades sing, his fists fly, and his enemies' heads
explode.</div>
<div>
<p></p>
His demonic master, Basilisk, has plans for Diablo -- but everything changes
when Diablo discovers his humanity after saving the life of a young mother. Now
Basilisk is out to destroy Diablo, with the help of a new protégé
-- Amon, a ruthless assassin formed from the souls of 1,000 serial killers.</div>

</div><br/></div>","THE BERZERK DEATH
DEALER is an over the top, ultra stylish action gore fest written and created
by Vishal Rajput. KILLER features: A Gothic style similar to the epic film
THE CROW fused with a punk rock look, brutal John Woo style gun action, 
and Vicious hand to hand combat in the vein of the Anime FIST OF THE NORTH
STAR. 






The Story: Young
Diablo
is
one
bad-ass
dude
that
is
armed
to
the
teeth
with
his
scythe
guitar
and
punk
rock
guns
killing
in
style with his loyal dog, Rockabella. As the
number one assassin for the
Demon
Clan,
he's
got
99,999
heads
to
prove
it.
He
can
smoke
a
joint
in
one
puff,
drain
a
beer
bottle
in one gulp, and talk trash better than anyone. When he gets going, his blades sing, his fists fly, and his enemies' heads
explode.


His demonic master, Basilisk, has plans for Diablo -- but everything changes
when Diablo discovers his humanity after saving the life of a young mother. Now
Basilisk is out to destroy Diablo, with the help of a new protégé
-- Amon, a ruthless assassin formed from the souls of 1,000 serial killers.










My Story: Hey guys! My name is Vishal Rajput. I'm an artist and writer living in the suburbs of Illinois. I have a strong passion for the arts and I'm insanely addicted to anime.  After
my
internship
at
the
indie
company,
""Smooth
Sounds
Multimedia,""
I
had
a
strong
passion
to
go
out
on
my
own
and
start my own production company, ""Planet Boom
Boom Pictures Ltd.,"" that is dedicated to making live Anime style films
encompassing all genres. Stories about revenge make great movies since you can
approach them anyway you like. At a personal level, I have approached ""The
Berzerk Death Dealer"" artistically and include a huge fan service that Anime
fans always want. AN ANIME STYLE MOVIE DONE RIGHT WITH ALL THOSE CRAZY BACK
DROPS, VELOCITY LINES, AND GRAPHIC NOVEL STYLE SEQUENCES.



The
teaser
trailer
version
of
""The
Berzerk
Death
Dealer""
is
based
off
of
the
20
minutes
prototype
I
shot
with
some
friends
and to show case our talent. The
prototype version is about Diablo fighting the 24 killjoy clan that betrayed
the demon clan and stole their drugs and the fight against the Mad Goat is to test
strength against man vs. beast.









Here's a little Fatality Story Board Sequence of the Mad Goat. 





I'm currently rebooting my project in a 6 part Manga graphic novel form to tell the
whole story of The Berzerk Death Dealer from start to finish
since it is much cheaper to make and I can get my full vision out without any
limits. The story is all finished and many of the artworks as well. Also, I'm
getting the help with another talented artist ASHLEE VAREKOIS to help me work
the
interior of the comic. 


Here's a link to her work. (Show artist work -
http://www.akoisart.moonfruit.com/digital-illustration/4589739339)

Another thing that sets this comic apart from most other comics is that we have two award winning leading actors from Hollywood to actually
star in this
comic. We give you MICHAEL EKLUND (films: The Divide, The Call, Eadweard, and Bates Motel) who will be the face of the main character,
DIABLO and TRISTAN RISK(films: American Mary, Call Girl, Frankenstein Created Bikers, and The Editor) who will be the face of the main character MAZ LATEX
for issue one.

</div></div>","What's the idea?We are Deadpool biggest fans. We also know things in design & knitting. And then there was Instagram post by @vancityreynolds and we told ourselves ""hey, we're not his Nana but we can do it!""



And so we did. Meet Deadpool Turtleneck Pullover Sweater Limited Collector's Edition. It sounds quite complicated (even for a big comic fan) so we used to call it simply DeadPull :)



Why should I get it?


First of all ask yourself why not. It's fun and it's also cozy. It's one of a kind and not a mass-market.  In case you dig one of those things then go on. Pick a perk. Or spread a word to participate in our referral program (see below). 

Will I get any superpowers?

You've got sense of humor and style if you are considering this. What else one might need in this crazy world? You already have them!

What else should I know?

We've spent hundreds of hours and pounds of yarn to prototype this sweater. We think it's just amazing and we are very fond of idea that we can make this project alive, produce and dress you or your friends in these amazing sweaters. We are so into it that we made the campaign flexible and any amount of contributors will get their perks as scheduled and promised.


Give me some specs.

 Deadpool (real name Wade Winston Wilson) is a fictional character, an antihero\superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Fabian Nicieza and artist/writer Rob Liefeld, the character first appeared in The New Mutants #98 cover-dated (Feb. 1991)...
Or you mean the pullover specs? Then we are glad you've asked. We use the highest grade hypoallergenic polyacrylic yarn produced in the EU for these seamless knitted sweaters. Like original Deadpool they are very soft (we know he is... deep inside) yet very durable. Machine wash ready. The actual color is offwhite. Turtleneck goes in 4 regular sizes and is unisex.
We also post pics to the Gallery tab for your convenience. 
What about risks?
 We are confident in what we are doing and did our best to cut out any risks. We have designs ready and estimated cost-wise, as well as evaluated in terms of timeframe required for implementation. Being very responsive to any issues that might arise, we guarantee real support to our contributors. We will communicate with you and answer any questions. Also feel free to subscribe to campaign updates.
Are there any ways to participate other than contributing?
Thanks for asking! Sure there are. Spread the word, share this campaign and become a referral. It's easy.


If 3 of your referred friends get the pullover, you get to buy one for 50% off
If 5 of your referred friends get the pullover, you get one for free


In either case, if you reach the referral level, we'll contact you with more instructions on how to claim your 50% off or your free vibrator.
Anyone who you refer through your share links when logged into Indiegogo. You'll be able to track referral progress through your personal account dashboard on the site. See Indiegogo's official guide on referral programs for more details.
Be cool. But also be warm. Peace & love.




Follow us on Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest and here is the link with all the media content in case one might need them.
