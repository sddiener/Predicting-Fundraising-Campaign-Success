<h3>The ELECTRICMOOD revolution</h3>
<p>We wanted to ride a portable transportation <b>foldable</b> device that would be, at the same time, <b>light</b>, <b>powerful</b>, <b>silent</b>, <b>beautiful</b>, <b>safe</b>, <b>fun</b> and <b>comfortable</b> to use... After 4 years of development and test, an incredible technology made this dream come true.</p>
<p>Now, the <b>ELECTRIC</b>MOOD is the greatest scooter ever. Thanks to a new direct drive brushless engine system, we can achieve a weight as low as <b>22 lbs</b> (10 kg) together with great features:</p>
<ul>
<li>12"" inflatable tires</li>
<li>Front and rear disk brakes</li>
<li>500W engine</li>
<li>Rechargeable lithium battery</li>
<li>Fast charger</li>
<li>Front and rear LED headlights</li>
<li>Quick and convenient folding system</li>
</ul>
<p>Our scooter provides <b>an extended range to your lifestyle</b>. It can be used instead of or together with public transports to reach your destination with fun. You can charge it everywhere, and save time.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>12 miles autonomy</li>
<li>Top speed limited to 16 mph by software</li>
<li>Maximum charge time of 1 hour</li>
<li>Very small footprint when folded: 37"" x 22"" x 8"" (925 mm x 570 mm x 205 mm)</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Throughout the years of living in different places, I always struggled with keeping my shower organized. My husband Jesse always complained about all the products I would store in our shower and recommended I stored them outside in a cabinet and when I was to shower, to bring them in with me, but I knew I would forget. Just when i thought I had found the perfect product that would bring the solution to my problem, I realized it had only made it worse. Every shower caddy I would buy would end up rusty or falling apart due to the weight of the bottles. I would end my shower with a bruised toe, picking up all the bottles and repairing the caddy. </p>
<p>I wanted to contribute to everyone who shared the same frustration as me by creating a product that was strong, durable and elegant.</p>
<p>The Shower Bench Drawer will give every homeowner a unique space of storage, keeping their products private and hidden from everyone else. What you can store inside the bench drawer is endless. The drawer is very easy to clean, it is made from a material that is mold and mildew free. </p>
<p>I am confident that with your contribution, the Shower Bench Drawer can be in every shower and on the shelves of every home improvement store.</p>
</div>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to invest in better tooling. All of our prototypes have been made by thermoforming molds and we are now working on injection molding for a better product. With your support you will help us with the first batch of mass production. </p>

<p>It happens all the time, right?  The weather is beautiful, you and your Jeep are ready to explore the great outdoors, and it never fails - you take the top off... and it rains!  One thing Jeep lovers know all too well is that when you take your top off, you are making a commitment.  Maybe there's going to be rain in the next few days, maybe it's going to end up being a lot hotter than expected.  Either way, you are either stuck with the top off, or stuck putting a whole lot of time AND energy to put the top back on. </p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558844026/smb32slbaouqhhudn02d.jpg"" src=""""/><p>With Trac-Top, you get the best of both worlds. Our patented design is simple: in a single motion, you can engage or disengage the top, retracting from the drivers seat or from the passenger seats. However much sun or shade you want is totally up to you. Everything installs using stock hardware and mounts, and you get protection from almost anything nature throws at you. Fire-resistant, non-toxic, and tear-resistant, the material used to create Trac-Top; will keep your seats dry and cool while still allowing you to enjoy nature.</p>
</div><div>
<p>The designs are done and we are getting ready to go into production.  Right now, we need your help.  We are looking to raise $25,000. These funds will help provide additional inventory when we get to manufacturing.  As a thank-you, we are offering Trac-Top at a major discount to you, our valued contributors.</p>

</div></div>","Introducing: Trac-Top™

It happens all the time, right?  The weather is beautiful, you and your Jeep are ready to explore the great outdoors, and it never fails - you take the top off... and it rains!  One thing Jeep lovers know all too well is that when you take your top off, you are making a commitment.  Maybe there's going to be rain in the next few days, maybe it's going to end up being a lot hotter than expected.  Either way, you are either stuck with the top off, or stuck putting a whole lot of time AND energy to put the top back on. 
With Trac-Top, you get the best of both worlds. Our patented design is simple: in a single motion, you can engage or disengage the top, retracting from the drivers seat or from the passenger seats. However much sun or shade you want is totally up to you. Everything installs using stock hardware and mounts, and you get protection from almost anything nature throws at you. Fire-resistant, non-toxic, and tear-resistant, the material used to create Trac-Top; will keep your seats dry and cool while still allowing you to enjoy nature.

The designs are done and we are getting ready to go into production.  Right now, we need your help.  We are looking to raise $25,000. These funds will help provide additional inventory when we get to manufacturing.  As a thank-you, we are offering Trac-Top at a major discount to you, our valued contributors.



TRAC-TOP FEATURES:

Direct replacement for the freedom panels
No more struggling to remove heavy bulky hard tops
Instant protection from the elements when you need it
Open air driving when you want it
Peace of mind for you and your passengers
Compatible with roof racks
Water-resistant


Other ways you can help. 
 In addition to contributing monetarily, you can help out by sharing our campaign with trail buddies and your local Jeep groups.  Go ahead and post the campaign link on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,  and any other social media platforms you use! The more people that are  aware of what we are doing with Trac-Top, the smoother the next few  months will go for us. We appreciate your contributions, monetary and  non-monetary, and thank you for your time. 



 
Risks and challenges
When you are creating something that people will be using in conjunction with their vehicles, you need to be sure that everything works exactly as intended. We have gone to extreme lengths in order to ensure the safety of Trac-Top. We have the utmost confidence in its design and in our manufacturing team. You can rest assure that any challenges that may arise between now and the time that we deliver Trac-Top to you, we will be sure to face them intelligently and boldly

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>The SoulFire Project</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>An Artistically Self-Sustainable Mobile
Community</i></p>
<p><b>MISSION:</b></p>
<p>The SoulFire Project has two objectives: First, to live in a
sustainable way within our mobile community, as well as with nature, the people and the communities we meet along the journey; Second, to use art and
eco-techniques to promote and grow this movement towards a more sustainable
future.</p>
<p><b>SHORT HISTORY:</b></p>
<p>In late 2008, my best friend Przemek and I (Cooper) started
to convert our 1979 Crown Supercoach school bus into a mobile
home/workshop/studio. Using many recycled and reclaimed building materials, and
with the help and support of family and many friends, we converted the
interior. We built and installed eight bunk beds, a kitchen, a wood stove, a
""living room"", and shelving. Through a lot of research and a
huge learning curve of trial and error, we successfully converted the engine to
run on waste vegetable oil. After a year of hard work, mistakes, and learning,
we gathered our tools, our musical instruments, our faith, five good friends,
and hit the road south. </p>
<p>Since leaving Oregon in November 2009, The SoulFire Project has travelled over 20,000 miles on waste vegetable oil. More than 100 artists, musicians, builders, engineers, and filmmakers from all over the world have shared various parts of this journey through the western United States, the majority of Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize.<br/></p>
<p><b>OUR WORK:</b></p>
<p>We use the
bus as a model to promote sustainable systems, demonstrating concrete solutions
to many problems that we all face today. The bus runs 98 percent of the time on
waste vegetable oil, almost eliminating our dependency on fossil fuels and reusing
“waste” that can contaminate water sources while drastically reducing our carbon footprint. All of our electricity is solar-powered, eliminating our dependence on coal, hydro-electric or nuclear power. When possible,
we catch and filter rainwater for drinking and washing. We wash our clothes
with our bicycle-powered washing machine, getting exercise while saving electricity. We convert 90 percent of our “garbage” into compost and building
materials (Eco-Bricks), which we save and give to projects that have land on
which to build with them. Everywhere we go, we promote these kinds of
“Eco-Techniques” through physical or virtual manuals and
workshops.</p>

<p><b>TODAY:</b></p>
<p>Right now
we are in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala where we have just finished making six
mini-documentary/promotional videos for the “Primeros Pasos” clinic. We are now gathering a diverse bank of local organic seeds to start the
SoulFire Seed Bank, organizing a music festival to showcase local bands and will soon be starting two different bicycle-machine projects. After this, the plan is to continue south, through Central
America and to Brazil - to continue growing this network and sharing and
promoting these tools for change with all the people who are ready and open to
the knowledge we have to share. </p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED:</b></p>
<p>Right now our bus in a condition
that makes it impossible to continue south. To keep this project moving, we
need to raise $9,000 to complete the maintenance overhaul on our beloved bus:</p>
<p>- 
Full transmission service, seal replacement and
11-quart gear oil change = $1,400</p>
<p>- 
Oil pump service &amp; seal replacement on pump
and pan + 6 gallon motor oil change. ($100 in seals, $160 in motor oil + 6.5
hrs labor) = $910</p>
<p>- 
Air system &amp; air dryer service + replacement
cartridge = $550</p>
<p>- 
Air compressor service ($500) OR replacement
($960)</p>
<p>- 
Steering &amp; driveshaft linkage greasing ($60
grease + 1.5 hrs labor) = $110</p>
<p>- 
Oil and fuel filters replaced (filters + 1.5 hrs
labor) = $200</p>
<p>- 
Differential service &amp; oil change (14 quarts
50w gear lube + 3 hr labor) = $680</p>
<p>- 
Hub/wheel bearing service &amp; oil change (replacement
wheel bearings, seals &amp; 2 quarts 50w gear lube + 3 hrs labor per side) =
$1,200</p>
<p>- 
Spare tire (mounted on rim) = $700</p>
<p>- New DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) = $780</p>
<p>- 
“Running the Rack” (typical Detroit Diesel
engine tune-up) 6-10 hrs labor = $1,000-1,600 (depending on whether motor needs
new injector rocker arms &amp; injectors.)</p>
<p>If we surpass our goal for this maintenance overhaul OR have
anything left over, know that it will be put to good use. Our “Toolbox” is a
wish list of things that could help us out a lot.</p>
<p><b>SoulFire Project
“Toolbox”</b></p>
<p>- 
(4) Heavy duty jack stands to help save the life
of our leaf springs.</p>
<p>- 
(2) 100w 12v solar panels to be able to use our
solar system to do projections, concerts and construction with power tools.</p>
<p>- 
(1) Projector to be able to host open air theater
nights, projecting our own and others’ short films, documentaries, and movies
directly from the bus!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Una Comunidad M</i><i>óvil Arte-Auto-Sustentable</i></p>
<p><b>MISIÓN:</b></p>
<p>El Proyecto
SoulFire tiene dos objetivos: En primer lugar, de vivir de manera sustentable,
tanto dentro de nuestra comunidad móvil, como con la naturaleza, la gente y las
comunidades que vamos conociendo; En segundo lugar, de usar el arte y técnicas
de auto-sustentabilidad para promover y hacer crecer este movimiento hacia un
futuro más sustentable.</p>
<p><b><b>BREVE </b>HISTORIA:</b></p>
<p>A finales
de 2008, mi mejor amigo, Przemek y yo (Cooper) empezamos a convertir nuestra
Crown SuperCoach, un autobús
escolar de 1979, en una casa móvil/taller/estudio. Utilizando muchos
materiales de construcción reciclados y con la ayuda y el apoyo de la familia y
muchos amigos, convertimos el interior. Construimos e instalamos ocho camarotes,
una cocina, una estufa de leña, una ""sala"", y repisas. A través de un
gran trabajo de investigación y una enorme curva de aprendizaje de ensayo y
error, logramos de convertir el motor para funcionar con aceite vegetal usado.
Después de un año de duro trabajo, juntamos nuestras herramientas, nuestros
instrumentos musicales, nuestra fe, cinco buenos amigos, y empezamos este
camino hacia al sur.</p>
<p>Desde que salió de Oregon en noviembre de 2009, el Proyecto SoulFire ha recorrido más de 20.000 millas con el aceite vegetal usado. Más de 100 artistas, músicos, constructores, ingenieros y cineastas de diferentes paises han compartido diversas partes de este viaje por el oeste de los Estados Unidos, la mayor parte de México, Guatemala y Belice.<br/></p>
<p><b>NUESTRO TRABAJO:</b></p>
<p>Utilizamos
el autobús como un modelo para promover sistemas sostenibles, demostrando
soluciones concretas a los muchos problemas que todos enfrentamos en la
actualidad. El autobús funciona 98 por ciento del tiempo en el aceite vegetal
usado, casi eliminando nuestra dependencia de los combustibles fósiles y
reutilizando ""residuos"" que pueden contaminar las fuentes de agua.
Toda nuestra electricidad es solar, eliminando nuestra dependencia
hidroeléctrica o la energía nuclear. Cuando sea posible, recogemos y filtramos
el agua de lluvia para beber y lavar. Nos lavamos la ropa con nuestra bici-lavadora, haciendo ejercicio en lugar de desperdiciar electricidad. Convertimos el 90
por ciento de nuestra ""basura"" en composta y materiales de
construcción (Eco-ladrillos). Donde quiera que vamos, se promueve este tipo de
""Eco-técnicas"" a través de explicaciones, manuales físicos o
virtuales, y talleres.</p>

The SoulFire Project
An Artistically Self-Sustainable Mobile
Community
MISSION:
The SoulFire Project has two objectives: First, to live in a
sustainable way within our mobile community, as well as with nature, the people and the communities we meet along the journey; Second, to use art and
eco-techniques to promote and grow this movement towards a more sustainable
future.
SHORT HISTORY:
In late 2008, my best friend Przemek and I (Cooper) started
to convert our 1979 Crown Supercoach school bus into a mobile
home/workshop/studio. Using many recycled and reclaimed building materials, and
with the help and support of family and many friends, we converted the
interior. We built and installed eight bunk beds, a kitchen, a wood stove, a
""living room"", and shelving. Through a lot of research and a
huge learning curve of trial and error, we successfully converted the engine to
run on waste vegetable oil. After a year of hard work, mistakes, and learning,
we gathered our tools, our musical instruments, our faith, five good friends,
and hit the road south. 
Since leaving Oregon in November 2009, The SoulFire Project has travelled over 20,000 miles on waste vegetable oil. More than 100 artists, musicians, builders, engineers, and filmmakers from all over the world have shared various parts of this journey through the western United States, the majority of Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize.
OUR WORK:
We use the
bus as a model to promote sustainable systems, demonstrating concrete solutions
to many problems that we all face today. The bus runs 98 percent of the time on
waste vegetable oil, almost eliminating our dependency on fossil fuels and reusing
“waste” that can contaminate water sources while drastically reducing our carbon footprint. All of our electricity is solar-powered, eliminating our dependence on coal, hydro-electric or nuclear power. When possible,
we catch and filter rainwater for drinking and washing. We wash our clothes
with our bicycle-powered washing machine, getting exercise while saving electricity. We convert 90 percent of our “garbage” into compost and building
materials (Eco-Bricks), which we save and give to projects that have land on
which to build with them. Everywhere we go, we promote these kinds of
“Eco-Techniques” through physical or virtual manuals and
workshops.
WORKSHOPS:
-Vegetable Oil Conversion @ Klimaforum,
COP16 Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo,
Mexico and the World Social Forum, Mexico
City, Mexico.
- Recycling and Composting
in middle schools/universities in Rio
Dulce, Guatemala and at the town fair in Maria Lombardo, Oaxaca, Mexico.

-  Construction of infrastructure (community
kitchen, plumbing, showers, and hand-washing stations) @ Klimaforum, COP16 Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo, Mexico
- 
Live sound, transportation and logistics @ Coctel de Femme, San Cristobal de las Casas,
Chiapas, Mexico




We have worked with organizations and communities on
permaculture, bio-building and appropriated technology projects such as bicycle
machines (Jaguar de Madera), solar power installations (La Ventana), super
adobe, Eco-Brick and Earthship constructions.
MUSIC:
- 
We’ve recorded three original albums on this
journey (El Primer Paso, Le Grand Voyage & YouRevolución), with musical styles ranging from
folk to reggae and from electric Balkan to cumbia.
- 
We have done fundraising & awareness concerts
for art/cultural centers and for people in need.  (El Paliacate, EDELO, Aldea Organica)
- 
We have recorded demos and live albums for other
artists (Kaguairán,
Las Hermanas Sista, and Dr. Nativo y Los Warriorcandela)
- 
We have played concerts at festivals, in plazas,
in the streets, and in schools. 
MINI-DOCUMENTARIES/VIDEOS:
-  Primeros Pasos, Six promotional/mini-documentary videos about Primeros Pasos, a non-profit clinic that offers free medical services to communities surrounding Quetzaltenango, Guatemala
- The Bicycle Washing Machine, Video exploring the construction of a bicycle-powered washing machine (built at Jaguar de Madera)
- 
Permacultores, Mini-documentary about,""El Jaguar de Madera"" a permaculture/bio-building center in San Cristobal de las Casas,
Chiapas, Mexico
- 
Blood, Sweat and Gun Powder, A poetic promotional video for,""El Paliacate"" a cultural center in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico
- 
Panaderia Los Sueños, Two promotional videos for, ""The Dream Bakery"" a bakery dedicated to helping at-risk teens in San Cristobal de
las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico
TODAY:
Right now
we are in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala where we have just finished making six
mini-documentary/promotional videos for the “Primeros Pasos” clinic. We are now gathering a diverse bank of local organic seeds to start the
SoulFire Seed Bank, organizing a music festival to showcase local bands and will soon be starting two different bicycle-machine projects. After this, the plan is to continue south, through Central
America and to Brazil - to continue growing this network and sharing and
promoting these tools for change with all the people who are ready and open to
the knowledge we have to share. 
WHAT WE NEED:
Right now our bus in a condition
that makes it impossible to continue south. To keep this project moving, we
need to raise $9,000 to complete the maintenance overhaul on our beloved bus:
- 
Full transmission service, seal replacement and
11-quart gear oil change = $1,400
- 
Oil pump service & seal replacement on pump
and pan + 6 gallon motor oil change. ($100 in seals, $160 in motor oil + 6.5
hrs labor) = $910
- 
Air system & air dryer service + replacement
cartridge = $550
- 
Air compressor service ($500) OR replacement
($960)
- 
Steering & driveshaft linkage greasing ($60
grease + 1.5 hrs labor) = $110
- 
Oil and fuel filters replaced (filters + 1.5 hrs
labor) = $200
- 
Differential service & oil change (14 quarts
50w gear lube + 3 hr labor) = $680
- 
Hub/wheel bearing service & oil change (replacement
wheel bearings, seals & 2 quarts 50w gear lube + 3 hrs labor per side) =
$1,200
- 
Spare tire (mounted on rim) = $700
- New DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) = $780
- 
“Running the Rack” (typical Detroit Diesel
engine tune-up) 6-10 hrs labor = $1,000-1,600 (depending on whether motor needs
new injector rocker arms & injectors.)
If we surpass our goal for this maintenance overhaul OR have
anything left over, know that it will be put to good use. Our “Toolbox” is a
wish list of things that could help us out a lot.
SoulFire Project
“Toolbox”
- 
(4) Heavy duty jack stands to help save the life
of our leaf springs.
- 
(2) 100w 12v solar panels to be able to use our
solar system to do projections, concerts and construction with power tools.
- 
(1) Projector to be able to host open air theater
nights, projecting our own and others’ short films, documentaries, and movies
directly from the bus!

El Proyecto SoulFire
Una Comunidad Móvil Arte-Auto-Sustentable
MISIÓN:
El Proyecto
SoulFire tiene dos objetivos: En primer lugar, de vivir de manera sustentable,
tanto dentro de nuestra comunidad móvil, como con la naturaleza, la gente y las
comunidades que vamos conociendo; En segundo lugar, de usar el arte y técnicas
de auto-sustentabilidad para promover y hacer crecer este movimiento hacia un
futuro más sustentable.
BREVE HISTORIA:
A finales
de 2008, mi mejor amigo, Przemek y yo (Cooper) empezamos a convertir nuestra
Crown SuperCoach, un autobús
escolar de 1979, en una casa móvil/taller/estudio. Utilizando muchos
materiales de construcción reciclados y con la ayuda y el apoyo de la familia y
muchos amigos, convertimos el interior. Construimos e instalamos ocho camarotes,
una cocina, una estufa de leña, una ""sala"", y repisas. A través de un
gran trabajo de investigación y una enorme curva de aprendizaje de ensayo y
error, logramos de convertir el motor para funcionar con aceite vegetal usado.
Después de un año de duro trabajo, juntamos nuestras herramientas, nuestros
instrumentos musicales, nuestra fe, cinco buenos amigos, y empezamos este
camino hacia al sur.
Desde que salió de Oregon en noviembre de 2009, el Proyecto SoulFire ha recorrido más de 20.000 millas con el aceite vegetal usado. Más de 100 artistas, músicos, constructores, ingenieros y cineastas de diferentes paises han compartido diversas partes de este viaje por el oeste de los Estados Unidos, la mayor parte de México, Guatemala y Belice.
NUESTRO TRABAJO:
Utilizamos
el autobús como un modelo para promover sistemas sostenibles, demostrando
soluciones concretas a los muchos problemas que todos enfrentamos en la
actualidad. El autobús funciona 98 por ciento del tiempo en el aceite vegetal
usado, casi eliminando nuestra dependencia de los combustibles fósiles y
reutilizando ""residuos"" que pueden contaminar las fuentes de agua.
Toda nuestra electricidad es solar, eliminando nuestra dependencia
hidroeléctrica o la energía nuclear. Cuando sea posible, recogemos y filtramos
el agua de lluvia para beber y lavar. Nos lavamos la ropa con nuestra bici-lavadora, haciendo ejercicio en lugar de desperdiciar electricidad. Convertimos el 90
por ciento de nuestra ""basura"" en composta y materiales de
construcción (Eco-ladrillos). Donde quiera que vamos, se promueve este tipo de
""Eco-técnicas"" a través de explicaciones, manuales físicos o
virtuales, y talleres.
TALLERES:
  -Conversión
de Motor a Aceite Vegetal @ Klimaforum, COP16 Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo,
México y el Foro Social Mundial, Ciudad de México, México
  - Reciclaje

Ahora estamos juntando un banco de diversas semillas, criollas y organicas, para iniciar el Banco de Semillas
SoulFire, organizando un festival de música para exhibir a talentosas bandas locales y pronto empezaremos dos proyectos de bici-máquinas. Despues de eso, el plan es continuar hacia el sur, a través de
América Central y hasta Brasil - a seguir creciendo esta red y compartiendo y
promoviendo estas herramientas para el cambio con todas las personas que están
dispuestos y abiertos al conocimiento que tenemos de compartir.

Backers reviewLars Möser:  ""I was out today test-driving this lovely thing. I cannot wait till August. Wow it is cool"" Andrias:""I got a test ride on this iron horse yesterday and I know it's going to be a hit. Can't wait till August"" Enjoy the ride
Enjoy riding up to 50 miles (80 km) on a single charge with speeds of up to 20 mph (32 km/h). Easy adjust the amount of assist on the go and feel the joy of riding an electric bike. Ride full throttle or use the 4 level pedal-assist. 
 
 
Smart LCD Display
The LCD display makes your everyday riding a true pleasure. Take advantage of STRØM technology, as we have upgraded the bike with LCD display and easy to use thumb controller. Riding a bike has never been a more smooth experience.
   
Easy to use thumb controller
The thumb controller makes your daily ride a smooth experience. Easy adjust the assist level on the go by pressing the + or - buttons on the controller. This gives you full flexibility and the opportunity to design the ride to fit your mood.  
 
The perfect all-round electric bike

The bike comes with a one-size frame equipped with 3"" inch all-terrain tires. This combined with its silent powerful motor, long lasting battery, LCD display and ultra-soft saddle is designed to make any ride a true pleasure.

 Timeless coloursWe have selected what we think is the most timeless and trending colours. Metallic white, moon gray or matte black. The choice is yours!
 EU MODEL VS. US MODELVAT for EU customers is set to 25% extra. For other countries please check your VAT as they vary from country to country.  Calculate taxes worldwide.Please note that the US model is not legal within most European countries. FACTS AND COMPONENTSTalking about a spoiled bike is no understatement. We love tech and cool features. Therefore, we have not compromised on the equipment of the bike. Take a closer look below. Portable battery for charging  Charge on the goAt STRØM Bike we are following society trends and have not overlooked the importance of staying connected. To knock off another excuse not to get on a bike, we created a built-in USB charger to keep you fully charged on the go. Leave traffic behindSTRØM Bike is your daily motivation to get on a bike. With STRØM, traffic is no longer an issue. No more driving at a snail's pace and arriving late as a result of traffic jams. Instead, beat the daily traffic and experience the freedom of riding an electric bike.  Focus more on the moment, less on the destinationSTRØM Bike allows you to focus more on the moment and less on the destination. The bikes ability to adapt to any riding situation is a true pleasure. Forget about frustrating tailwind and up-hill terrain. Instead adjust the amount of assist to fit your mood and let STRØM take you on new adventures.   Safety firstWe designed STRØM Bike with safety in mind. The bike features a built-in LED light to keep you safer on the roads. It improves your visibility at night and makes it possible for cars to spot you from a long distance.

<h2>Introducing RageBridge 2</h2>

<br/>
<strong>RageBridge</strong> <b>2</b> is a no-frills and robust dual-channel DC 
motor controller for robotic and vehicular drivetrain applications. It 
can supply 50 amps per side continuously. An ultra-wide (8 to 40 volts) input range maximizes 
versatility and allows it to be used in many different systems. A large and fully 
isolated heat sink base allows you to attach it to a metal chassis for 
even better thermal performance. It weighs 4 ounces and is 4.15"" x 2"" x 0.9"" without wires.<br/><p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Architecture</b></h3>
<br/>
<p>
RageBridge 2 is a dual H-bridge allowing control of up to two DC brush 
motors independently, integrated onto a single board. The switching 
topology of RageBridge 2 is known as ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_rectification"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">synchronous rectification</a>."" In this method, the motor is always being alternately powered and then braked.</p>
<p>While
 it may sound unnecessarily complicated, it significantly decreases heat
 dissipation in both motor and power MOSFETs because current is never 
just being burnt off as heat for a portion of the switching cycle.  </p>
<p>The
 bidirectional current flow means the battery supply gets recharged when
 the motor is undergoing braking, with energy supplied from the kinetic 
energy of the moving drivetrain or actuator. This translates to an 
increase in run time of a few percent in most cases. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

<br/>
<h3><b>Constant Current Limiting</b></h3>
<p><br/>
RageBridge differs again from most DC motor controllers in how it handles motors that are bigger than it should be driving!</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>
 The vast majority of controllers simply do not have any protection. 
That means a sudden short, drivetrain lockup, or motor failure will 
destroy the controller as it tries to flow the motor stall current. 
Sizing a controller to handle motor stall current is very impractical 
and expensive, often resulting in controllers being many times bigger 
than they need to be.    </p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>
 Many popular DC motor controllers today advertise ""overcurrent 
protection."" But often, they mean is the controller will shut down upon a
 certain current threshold, and often requires a power cycle or the load
 to drop to zero before enabling again. This means that under heavy 
acceleration, your robot or vehicle might just turn off all of a sudden,
 leaving it (or you) stranded. Once again, the controller has to be many
 times overrated in order to handle the load.</p>

<br/>
<p>RageBridge 2
 features an innovative hysteresis-based current limiting scheme where 
there is a true output current ceiling. The motor output current is 
sample 15,000 times every second, and if it is over the threshold, the 
output voltage is reduced each cycle until the current falls under the 
limit.</p>
<p>This
 results in a fluctuating output voltage whose average magnitude is just
 enough to maintain the maximum current. The sampling rate is fast 
enough to prevent a sudden motor stall from damaging the controller in

</h2><p> </p></div>","The wait is over. It's here.The highly anticipated campaign is finally here and ready to kick-off! We're super excited and equally proud of the work everyone has put in to make this happen. We're now officially ready, set, GO! to bring this beauty out to all of you.It's the new MATE X.All hail the successor
Good things last. Great things get even better.MATE X, the newest member of the MATE family, will definitely turn heads. It’s bigger, more powerful and certainly makes an impression. It’s got it all - the affordability, the image, the attitude. It’s also built to let you push your limits: Go ahead and venture off the beaten path. It’s your ride to ultimate freedom. Meet the makersChristian & JulieCopenhagen siblings Christian Adel Michael and Julie Kronstrøm came up with MATE out of a shared passion for the bike. Their goal was to create an affordable, foldable, e-bike that is not only fun to ride but is cool enough to inspire everyone to hop onto one. With Christian’s natural-born entrepreneurial skills, combined with Julie’s business development and project management talents, their segue into realizing their dream has been an enormous success. Ride in style. Ride with pride.MATE X is much more than an upgrade. It’s a completely new bike. A bigger, and longer frame that is fitted with wide-rim fat tires. Its color scheme is fittingly more bold and extreme. Flying the MATE X colors
New colors are Subdued Black (Matte), White Ice, Burnt Orange, Desert Storm (Matte) plus a FOUNDERS EDITION special ""Unicorn"" coating.For the MATE X, we've wiped the board and made an entirely new color scheme that fits the obvious, physical boldness of the bike's design. We want the coat to be an extension of what the MATE X expresses and embodies: More freedom, more attitude, less beaten paths. Find your soul MATESimply pick your ride and get ready for the thrill of pure riding freedom! Get in. Grind 'n go!The new MATE X boasts a much more powerful motor of up to 750W combined with an impressive 48V battery and controller across all models. The two combined returns significantly increased torque – and a big WOW! when you feel it.We’ve geared up by introducing Shimano 8-speed gearing with improved easy-gear shifting. The new computer display is equipped with a backlit LED as standard. We also offer the option to upgrade to a SMART beautiful display in color (pictured) for only 99 USD (149 USD value).The foldable pedals are an entirely new design packaged in a more sturdy pedal frame for improved power-transfer.We’ve also upgraded to Tektro braking system, including levers and calipers, for quicker, more efficient stopping power. We’re currently offering hydraulic braking systems for $129 USD upgrade for smoother braking that requires less braking force.

(Unfolded: 124 cm high, 180 cm long, 65 cm wide)This means you can bring it along anywhere you want to turn everywhere you go into an adventure! Riding the saddle of successWith the help of each one of you, the backers, the first MATE did really well. We're extremely proud of being the world's best funded foldable bike ever. But what really makes a difference for us is the fact the we've made many thousands more jump on a bike. Actually, it just goes to show what a lot of people all over the world can do if they pull together.That's what keeps us going - through the hard times where we’ve really dealt with a lot. And by coming out the other end of it, we are stronger, more motivated and more prepared to take the Mate Bike brand to an entirely new level. We are excited to bring all that we’ve accumulated over the last couple of years back to you in the form of MATE X.Together we made a statement with first campaign and showed the world that big things can be accomplished. Let's do it again. Let's get those big fat tires rollin' all around the world. MATE X, your newest best MATE! Experience has improved productionA wise man once said that you need to fail hard before you can succeed. Although we haven't quite hit rock bottom, we definitely have been challenged hard during the last campaign. At times it's been tough, but we've learnt from our mistakes and used the experiences to avoid repetition. In particular, we’ve nailed two key areas the last year - manufacturing and logistics.  We're now ready and confident that all touch-points from ordering to delivery will live up to expectations. Our goal is set. Let’s reach it together.We’re done with prototyping  and are currently optimising parts, configurations and logistics. To start up the production, we have set a goal of $50,000 for this campaign. We want to take this bike to the next level and get even more people out on the saddle.With this said, everyone who helps us in the making of the next MATE eBike, will get it at less than 1/2 the retail price – and will be the first to be offered exclusive, premium perks as well as VIP access to the upcoming webstore. We are MATE familySince the last campaign, we’ve worked very hard on improving every aspect of our company. We’ve built an order- and customer service system from scratch. We are training our support team to handle the huge demands, as well as preparing them for future challenges. We have learnt our lessons (dearly!) and have employed help in most areas. Our Mate family now totals 10 full-time members, all pulling their weight and making things happen. We’ve invested in a MATE Lab, where we test the bikes, including components, to work on improvements. Adding an in-house mechanic has certainly helped as well as providing valuable feedback for MATE moving forward. You're much more than a customerWe’re not only building a bike or a brand, but rather seeding a community of encouragement while we grow our company along with our backers. We’re constantly improving both the bikes and our own performances, listening to and seriously taking in feedback.In essence, our bikes are made by each one of you! THIS is and always will be our fundamental mission to accomplish - making the best MATE’s for everyone. What our customers are saying about usMATE is the biggest crowdfunding success ever in bike-crazy Denmark, with people from all over the world continuing to support the project. There are currently close to 10,000 MATE Bikes in circulation, helping to make traffic cleaner, cooler and run more smoothly. Through the community of MATE backers, we have received loads of feedback that’s made it possible to create the next generation of eBikes.In the last 3 months, 70% of our Trustpilot reviews were 4 and 5 stars. We expect our ratings to continue to improve! Now that our growing pains have all been worked out through our original MATE series production (which caused long delays in delivery), it's smooth sailing from here on out. Others are talking about us too Spread the love. Let's make MATE X happen! The Cycling Embassy of Denmark was founded in 2009 to make it easy for poli­ticians, planners, engineers, architects, journalists, NGOs all over the world to access our know-how and help cities around the globe make cycling an important part of their urban transporta­tion.The members of the Cycling Embassy of Denmark represent the latest knowledge of all areas related to cy­cling. Frequently Asked Questions The price is very low for an e-bike. How is that possible? Our extensive experience in product sourcing and manufacturing helped us a lot to secure and develop excellent supplier and shipping partnerships so we can offer a high quality product for the lowest possible price. Crowdfunding certainly helps us to keep the costs down so we can work together with the factory to product the right amount of units, without dealing with high storage costs and other related expenses Can I order MATE X 750 even though I do not live in US? We deliver MATE X 750S anywhere in the world as long as local laws permit us to import MateNB: It is not officially legal to drive MATE X 750S on public roads in the EU. You are allowed to own it and drive it on private property.NB: We have not obtained an import permit for MATE X 750S in Australia. We advise Australian backers to get a MATE X 250 or MATE X 250+ How much weight can MATE X handle? MATE X is built strong enough to easily handle riders of up to 150 kg. Does MATE X come in different sizes? MATE X is designed to fit everyone from 150 cm /4’9” to those over 215 cm / 7’0” with ease. Just adjust the saddle and handlebar height to match your measurements and off you go. I can't see the battery - where is it? Batteries are not something that should be felt, not seen. That’s why ours is hidden nicely within the frame, protected by a locking mechanism. Can I still ride my MATE X if the battery runs out of power? Of course! If you run out of power, you can ride it as you would a regular bicycle. Can the battery be removed? Yes. The battery is designed in such a way that you can change it or replace with 2 easy steps that take less than a minute. Simply fold the bike frame at the middle, pull out the battery and you’re done. How is MATE X delivered and is it easy to assemble? MATE X is delivered with instructions in a securely packed box and requires minimal assembly. However, if you don't have much experience with bikes, we strongly recommend that you visit your local bike shop to get all parts tightened and thoroughly checked for the best experience. How much does shipping cost? Shipping is set to $200 due to the fact that we ship worldwide directly from our factory in Asia. It is also one of the reasons its possible to keep MATE X prices so competitive, as there are no intermediaries between you and the factory #MATEaffordable.NB: Application of extra shipping costs:  if you are in a “difficult to ship area”, such as remote locations, extra shipping costs may be applied. Please also note that some destinations, such as remote islands, can prove simply impossible to ship to. If you think you live in a hard-to-reach location, then please contact us before placing your order. My bike box arrived damaged. What should i do? If there is visible damage to your MATE box that appears to have damaged the bike and/or its other contents, please notify the courier immediately as they are held responsible for all damage caused in transit. Request documentation from them stating that you have received a box with visible damages. You will need this for insurance purposes to qualify for a replacement MATE X.  I live in Denmark, can I pick it up myself? No. MATE X eBike is ordered in bulk and will be shipping to individuals directly from our assembly in Asia, as well as to regional commercial warehouses that is not setup for walk-in or local pickup.All MATE X’s will be shipped via ground shipping to your address we have on file. Why is my bike spec’d with a component that differs from that listed on your site? MATE X is still in its prototype stage, so some components are subject to change if we find better, more suitable replacements. Once past this stage, we will continue to reserve the right to switch components for ones equal or higher in value. The purpose of this is to ensure that the customer continues to get the best value bike for the price. What kind of warranty do you offer? All MATE bikes and batteries come with a 2 year limited manufacturer's warranty. Should you encounter some production related manufacturer’s defect during this time, we will take care of it according to our warranty. As many elements of a bike may get damaged due to normal cycling use/natural ware, we do not offer warranty on parts such as tires, disc brakes, chain, brake pads, etc. For more details, please contact our customer service department. What is your returns policy? This is the ""MATE-promise"": We are so confident that you will love your new MATE so much, that we offer you a 14 days money back guarantee after you have received it, if you are not satisfied.However, if you decide to do so, your MATE bike must be in new and re-sellable condition. #MATEpromiseReturns shipping to our nearest regional warehouse must be covered by you. What kind of accessories do you currently have or can I expect in the near future?We are soon offering a more powerful battery for MATE X 250+ and MATE X 750S only, as an upgrade or as spare battery. We are currently working to develop  a GPS, rear-rack with brake lights and more accessories and modifications, that we will introduce during the campaign.Stay tuned for more information. Feel free to let us know what kind of accessories you’d be most interested in seeing.  What about spare parts? Can any bike shop assist me?The MATE X battery is custom built for our frame. These batteries you can buy directly from us. The rest of the components are fairly standard, so you can upgrade/repair/customize your bike as you wish with other parts either from us or your local bike shop. Is it really true I can get up to 80 miles on a single charge with ""BOOSTER""?In ideal conditions and in ECO+ mode = Assist level 1, this can be done.Keep in mind, though, that other factors can also influence your reach such as power assist setting, terrain, total bike/rider weight, weather and riding conditions (city vs countryside). City or country side riding On ""BOOSTER"" battery, you can get anywhere between 20-100 miles, depending on your riding style. For maximum range, it certainly helps to add a bit of human power - especially on steep climbs and when accelerating.**All MILES/KILOMETERS listed on Indiegogo are ""UP TO"" and not guaranteed.** Do I need a licence to ride MATE X?No. Our bikes are made 100% street legal. We offer two distinctive versions of MATE: MATE X 250 / 250+, with a 250W motor which is legal in the EU, and MATE X 750S, with a 750W motor for the US.MATE X 250 and 250+ with 250W motor, is by default limited according to EN15194 to the top speed of 25 km/h (15,5 mph). This means that the motor will only help you up to 25km/h. MATE X 750S, with its 750W motor, is limited to 20 mph (32 km/h), which is the legal limit in US. It will be possible to change these settings with some reprogramming which we will make available after the campaign through MATE.community. Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT/GST?The backer is responsible for these costs. Please check your country's import duties/VAT/GST before purchasing. It is currently 0% in the US and varies internationally. Duties/VAT/GTS is to be paid before we can deliver your MATE X. We will send payment links, invoice overview and ask for a final delivery address confirmation before we ship your MATE X.  Can I test ride a MATE X bike?At this stage, test rides are only available in Copenhagen. Contact us by email for a test ride. Can I get a refund?Please refer to IndieGoGo's policy here.In the event we are unable to deliver your MATE X to your location due to any legal restrictions on the import or delivery of your bike, we shall refund you 75% of the amount on your indiegogo campaign contribution. You are responsible for determining whether its legal to import, deliver, and operate the MATE X at your location. In the even you cancel your Indiegogo contribution more than 10 days after it was made, we will assess an administration fee of 25% of your pledge and shall refund the remainder.  Can I change my order?Yes, it is possible to upgrade or downgrade your product. If we are still in the campaign period, the best way is to ask for a refund is through your profile on Indiegogo where you’ll find a “refund” button. And then “back” a new perk/make the order again. If the order is locked and you are transferred to our database, we charge an additional fee on 50 USD in administration fees.

<p>Bike Pirates also partners with other local and grassroots organizations for community projects, events, outreach and fundraising. We provide our space at no charge to other organizations looking to host community events including movie nights, dance parties, dinners, socials, book/magazine launches, and speaking events.

<p>Our organization's structure is unique - we are run completely by volunteers, we organize ourselves by consensus, and we run 100% on the donations made by our participants.

<p>The used parts and bicycles that we receive come from individuals in our community as well as local bicycle shops who value our work. The few dollars that folks donate to use our tools are what keep our rent paid and our lights on. Now that we are facing a big change and assessing our future we need to reach out to our community to donate to build a better Bike Pirates.</p>
<p>We have called the Bloor and Lansdowne neighbourhood home for 6 years, filling up a Bloor Street storefront with 9 repair stands, lots of tools, piles of used parts, and so so so many bicycles. Thousands of people (and bikes) have come through our door and been helped over the past 6 years.

<p>One of our goals is to improve our storage and organization, as well as building an even more open and accessible space. This space is much larger which will allow us to build a more physically accessible space, and to have (gasp) more than one toilet!

<p>Our goal is to raise $20,000 to be able to launch a bigger and better Bike Pirates.

For the last two years we have been working on a solution for a personal pain. Apparently that pain is shared by many photographers and people:



Photographers are busy shooting, making photos, less time to socialize.
People aren't aware of the photographer around . 

                                                 No communication. No connection. 

Few prototypes and tests, we came up with a fast and Easy communication channel to get people and photographers connected: 
                                     Meet Picquest 



How does it work:


""Featuring a simple design with an intuitive layout for both the profile pages and the browsing experience, Picquest offers a unique marketing platform for photographers who are looking to stand out and get their name and services recognized in a simple and effective method."" - Petapixel
""It seems Picquest has the potential to be both a location- and image-based social network and a business development tool for professional photographers."" - DP CONNECT
We got covered by Petapixel.com, dpconnect.com, geektime.com, Megapixel.co.il and many more in German, Spanish, Italian and even one covered pooed out in Taiwan! 



        Find photographers around you. Connect!





Cool. It's working. Now we need your help!
 We created a fast and cool communication channel and a way to find and connect with the photographer you need, when you need him.
Based on beta testing, with more than 4000 users and 2000 world photographers, we need to enhance the service. We must make it GREAT!

       Our plan:


Fester messaging enhancement. 
Add attachment to messages (In case the photographer want to share photo, file or address) Real-Time web to App to web messaging.  Enhance photo upload options so photographers can post their photos ASAP, and photos will be streamed to apps/web around the globe. 

Post request for photographer service. Just pick the date/location. Post
Finish the Android app version development. Post it for free on Google play.  

                                      


                            




The Impact So far the response from both world photographers, people and media groups is great. With the new enhancements, we are about to change the way people, Photographers and photos are connected.   
More photographers online and available around the globe. More photos taken. Happy people.  
                                Enjoy photography! Get to the photos you need:



            

Get people interested in your photos. People can reach you for Print, Copy or commercial usage interest. They can contact you directly!
What people say? They are happy...We need to make them connected. Available. 



        

Challenges
 
We still have the Android people and photographers out there, waiting for the Android version.  That version app under development and we need it ASAP.

<div> </div>
<div>✅ <strong>Carbon Fiber Deck</strong>
</div>
<div>Backfire Mini is built with 100% pure aerospace grade carbon fiber to significantly reduce the weight of the board to 5.8kg/12.8lbs and greatly increase the strength of the board.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>✅ <strong>1.5h Fast Charging</strong>

<div>Don't worry about running out of battery. Backfire Mini offers 1.5h fast charging. Within the period of a lunch or coffee time, the board is fully charged for your next adventure.</div>

<p>1. Backfire's roots were a traditional skateboard company, so they know what a skateboarder expects from their ride... The Mini has a great concave deck to give you a planted ride, yet it has a kickable nose and tail, which gives you the freedom to ride in more confined spaces... curb jumps, transcending steps, tik tak, 180 degree static kick turns are all a doddle... unlike other boards that CALL themselves ""Mini boards""...</p>
<p>2. Despite being a true Mini Board, its range is still 15-18km, that's 10miles per charge, amazingly it can also be ridden at high speeds, a ground breaking 42km/h, that’s 26mph... Plus... with it’s torquey hub motors, hill climbing is not an issue...</p>
<p>3. There is also a smaller, easily switchable, optional battery available, 99wh, which means you can easily take it on plane and go around the world</p>
<p><strong>The right choice is Backfire... you know it makes sense right!</strong></p>
<h3><strong>We Are Already In Production!</strong></h3>
<p>We have completed the production of the mold and entered the mass production stage. It is expected that the first batch of 200 sets of Backfire Mini will be produced on October 25, 2019.</p>

In student age, they were troubled to spend their money for the expensive or even over-priced skateboards.  Therefore, Randy and Jerry co-founded Backfire Skateboards in 2009 with a mission for the company to deliver high quality, affordable skateboards and fun to all skateboarders in the world.  Backfire entered the electric skateboard field in later 2014 and introduced Backfire G1, then in 2016 started the project for Backfire G2, and come production in later 2017.  Randy leads the major R&amp;D and lives in China. As a skater, Randy did a lot of testing on his own during R&amp;D stage to make sure the board performs the best for the users.   Jerry came to the United States to get his Master degree in business and lived in Richmond Virginia with his family; currently leads the company's strategic planning and marketing.  </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Backfire G2 Project Mile Stones</strong></p><ul>

VOLTA's in the news! 

 

 
Get to you need to be

From Palo Alto to San Francisco, from Brooklyn to the Bronx and back, with 40 miles of power your rides are no longer limited by your legs. Let your imagination plan your route and see where it takes you.
The uphill test:

 

 
Integrated headlights and taillights activate at the first sign of low-light, and the automatic brake light helps keep you visible on the road, in traffic, and wherever your adventures take you. No hassle, no headaches, just illumination when you need it.
 

 
Anti-theft GPS tracking so you’ll never lose your ride.

Power how you want it, belt-drive or chain.
Whether you prefer the timeless look and feel of a chain or you’re ready to take the leap into the hassle-free world of belt drives, there’s a Volta set-up just for you. Belt drives are low-maintenance, mess free, and super durable so you can focus on the ride, not repairs. Chains are a bit more work, but if you’re a competent wrench, you might prefer the classic feel and knowing exactly what to expect on your maintenance calendar. It’s up to you!

<h1><b>Converting Your Current Board </b></h1>
<p>The Eon Power-train's modular design allows for multiple configurations and flexibility to fit almost any deck or any trucks you currently own.</p>
<p><strong><u>Step 1:</u></strong> Though compatible with almost all types of skateboard decks and trucks, you should have a reasonably flat and smooth underside. </p>

<p> Laws and regulations pertaining electric longboards or electric skateboards vary by country, state, county, and municipality. You are responsible in making sure that it is legal to ride in your area, so please make sure you investigate your local regulations.  </p>
<p>Skateboarding, and especially on electric powered boards, is an inherently dangerous sport and safety equipment should be used at all times, especially a helmet. Don’t be too cool for safety equipment and risk your life. Even the pros use a helmet and pads. Always watch out for cars while riding on surface roads open to traffic and follow all local rules. Always skate within your abilities and use common sense while riding.  </p>
<p>Your board can become unresponsive and loose power and brakes at any moment due to many factors like: dead remote battery, unintentional release of the throttle, radio interference, dropping the remote control, regenerative overcharging of a full battery, or other. This will turn the board into an unpowered skate without brakes, so learn how to slow down by sliding and only ride your board at speeds that where you would be able to stop without power or brakes.  </p>
<p>Unlimited Engineering accepts no liability should you injure yourself using any products sold under our brand names.  </p>

The Eon Power-train's modular design allows for multiple configurations and flexibility to fit almost any deck or any trucks you currently own.
Step 1: Though compatible with almost all types of skateboard decks and trucks, you should have a reasonably flat and smooth underside. 
 
 
Step 2: With (3) power-train options, you can build the ultimate long-distance cruiser, a lightweight shredder, or any combo you can imagine. Pick a type and start building! 

Getting The Complete
If you're not interested in converting your board, no problem! We're offering a Limited Edition set of complete boards made to our specs. Each Complete Board comes pre-assembled right out of the box. Just turn it on and begin riding in seconds!   
 

Pre-Tuned & Custom Modes
Both our Kits and our Completes come with the Unlimited mobile app enabling three riding modes which can be fine-tuned to your preferences.

With our custom options, you can further tune each aspect to create special scenarios for max range, max speed, and more... Simply open the Eon Smartphone App and start adjusting while you ride to find the setting that fits best. 
It's All In The Features 
Loaded with features for performance, durability, safety and so much more.

 

 


Progressive Brakes: just by slowing down, our regenerative braking automatically adds an average of a 10% range. 

Weather resistant: motor and electronics are weather proof so you can ride through puddles (heavy rain or submerging not recommended)

Carbon plate: Our mounting plate is made from carbon fiber to keep the weight low and performance through the roof!  

Optimum Field-Oriented Control: advanced control algorithms for a smooth, stealthy ride with direct drive motors for natural torque.  

Nitro Button: shhhh...it's your secret weapon and extra power that’s active for a few seconds and will let you edge out in any race! 



So Which Is Right For Me? 
The Power-Train Electric Kits
If you're considering converting your current board, our Kit option may be best. Remember, each one is simple to install and lets you keep your own board and trucks. Just slide the mounting plate under your rear truck, attach the power pack and bolt on the motor as if it were a standard wheel.
It's seriously that easy...

Product Roadmap
After more than a year and countless prototypes we are excited to get our product into the public. Below you'll find our product roadmap for the coming months. 

 
The Unlimited Engineering team is formed by Carlos Kübler, Juan Pablo Viera and Alejandro Veloz, a group of engineers passionate about riding, racing, and extreme sports.

 

 
 
An Agency 2.0 Certified Campaign to ensure quality and fulfillment.
 
 
 At Agency 2.0, our commitment is to the backers by vetting every crowdfunding campaign to ensure the quality product designs, fulfillment practices and the team behind the campaign.  
When backing an Agency 2.0 Certified Partner Campaign, you can rest assured we did our homework so you do not have to. Our certified campaigns far exceed the industry in quality and in on-time delivery.
 
 
 Laws and regulations pertaining electric longboards or electric skateboards vary by country, state, county, and municipality. You are responsible in making sure that it is legal to ride in your area, so please make sure you investigate your local regulations.  
Skateboarding, and especially on electric powered boards, is an inherently dangerous sport and safety equipment should be used at all times, especially a helmet. Don’t be too cool for safety equipment and risk your life. Even the pros use a helmet and pads. Always watch out for cars while riding on surface roads open to traffic and follow all local rules. Always skate within your abilities and use common sense while riding.  
Your board can become unresponsive and loose power and brakes at any moment due to many factors like: dead remote battery, unintentional release of the throttle, radio interference, dropping the remote control, regenerative overcharging of a full battery, or other. This will turn the board into an unpowered skate without brakes, so learn how to slow down by sliding and only ride your board at speeds that where you would be able to stop without power or brakes.  
Unlimited Engineering accepts no liability should you injure yourself using any products sold under our brand names.

The CryptX2 will show green LEDs if the device is unlocked correctly, or red LEDs if you entered the wrong passkey. (warning, entering the wrong passkey 10 times will cause permanent loss of your data and require you to reformat the CryptX2)<br/><br/>You have 15 seconds to plug the CryptX2 into the computer or it will auto lock. The CryptX2 will show up on your computer as 2 regular USB Mass Storage drives, you can use them the same as any other flash drive or hard drive.<br/><br/><strong>**Locking theCryptX2**</strong><br/>The device will automatically lock when removed from the USB port or if the OK button is pressed.<br/><br/><strong>**Read Only Mode**</strong><br/>You can enable/disable read only mode to prevent writing to the sd cards by pressing the 1 or 2 (for sd card 1 or 2) button after the device is unlocked. When the device is in read only mode the SD1 or SD2 LED will be red. The led will be green when in normal (read/write) mode.<br/><br/><strong>**Panic Mode**</strong><br/>The panic mode is used to destroy your data when you are forced to give your<br/>password by an attacker. <br/>The panic password is a different password than your normal unlock password or Device ID password. The panic password is entered in the same way as a normal unlocking of the CryptX2, except when you enter this panic password the CryptX2 will delete the current salt and generate a new one, so your current data will be lost and the device will appear to be freshly formatted. There is no indication that you have used a panic password VS your normal password. The data you previously had on the CryptX2 will be permanently lost, and the device will continue to work with the panic password as a normal CryptX2 so your attacker will not know for sure if the panic mode was used or if the CryptX2 just hasn't been used with the sd cards loaded in the CryptX2 yet.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
We have parts for 100 CryptX2 beta units here, many of which have been assembled and tested. And while the design is good and works well, we are making some upgrades and design improvements for the final version. The most important change is going from the AT32UC3A464S microcontroller which offers 64k of program flash to the AT32UC3A3256S which offers 256k. While the 64k is way more than enough for the CryptX2 in its current use, however since we are developing this to be open source and the firmware is upgradeable we want to make sure we offer the greatest flexibility as possible. To make this change we have updated the schematic. We are currently redesigning the pcb to fit the new, slightly larger microcontroller. By the time you are reading this we will have the new pcb's for building the final prototypes before we order in bulk for the final production run for the indiegogo orders.<br/><br/> The firmware is functional, but not quite worthy of release for general use. We still need to do some optimization, clean up and commenting to make it easier to work with. We are also testing a the KDA (Key Derivation Algorithm) to find the best solution for this device in terms of speed and computational cost. The only real difficulty we are having with the firmware is perfecting the hidden data feature. This feature is an additional feature very similar to Truecrypt's hidden volume feature which unlocks an alternate set of data with a different password. Currently this feature is under development. The panic mode and normal encryption modes are working fine.<br/><br/>Some of our first alternate firmware versions are under development and will be launched at, or near the time of the CryptX2 release. The alternate versions currently in progress are:<br/><br/>Color Blind - This version will use alternate led display methods developed with color blind members of the community.<br/><br/>Custom Salt - This version will let you create the salt that is used. This will allow you to back up and duplicate CryptX2 devices that can decrypt the same data, however there is an added risk of knowing/saving this salt.<br/><br/>Raid0 - This version will use both sd cards combined in a Raid 0 (striped mode) to show as 1 device in your computer. This will provide faster speed.<br/><br/>Raid1 - This version will show only 1 drive in your computer, the additional sd card is used as a redundant backup in case of data failure on the primary sd card.<br/><br/>CDROM - This version will emulate a USB CDROM from any .ISO file named disk.iso in the root of the sd card on slot 1. The cd/dvd is bootable and is read only. Support for multiple .iso selection will be offered in the future.</div>

<div>CryptX2 3D Render of Case<br/><br/> We have a stretch goal of about $50k so we can work on development of a case for the CryptX2. We have been working on the 3d renderings of the case and have tested a few of the designs on the 3d printer at our local hackerspace (HeatSync Labs in Mesa, AZ). Once we perfect the design we plan to do plastic injection molding for the finished cases. The cases will be snap fit to allow you to open and close it to access the jtag, gpio and battery solder pads. The buttons will be flush with the top of the case so accidental key-presses will be minimized. The SD cards will stick slightly out of the side of the case so they can be removed, but will remain securely in the CryptX2 during use. We will also make all the files available for the 3d printing of the cases in case you want to make or modify your own cases and have access to a 3d printer. The costs for getting the molds made for plastic injection molding are very expensive, and the skill of the mold maker is important to be sure you end up with nice looking parts. Once the molds are made, it is only a few cents each to make the cases.</div>

Numb hands, sore wrists, tight neck and shoulders! We’ve experienced the same aches and pains. So we built on the success of our Kinekt Suspension Seatpost, using the same patented parallelogram design, and created the Kinekt Active Suspension Stem. It smooths out every ride. You get more comfort, better control on your bike, and less fatigue. It’s a total game changer. BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP TO BRING THIS REMARKABLE PRODUCT TO MARKET. BE A FAN!

 It's a great ride. Add a Kinekt Active Suspension Stem to your bike, and you’ll immediately feel the difference. It’s amazing. Our proven parallelogram spring design helps eliminate high frequency vibrations that cause common cycling complaints. You’ll be a lot more comfortable, with less pain and less fatigue when you ride.    Get rid of the OUCH! Recent studies have shown that these are the most common upper body complaints by cyclists. It was determined that rough roads decrease cycling power, increase stress levels, and even cause lack of control and diminished vision. In fact, vibrations from 1 hour of cycling was found equal to 4 hours of heavy tractor use.* Ouch!*The Impact of Vibration on Comfort and Bodily Stress While Cycling by John Parkin, PhD and Sainte Cluque, and Influence of Vibration on Work Performance during Ergometer Cycling by Björn Samuelson, Lennart Jorfeldt, and Björn Ahlborg.  We’ve taken our tried-and-true Active Suspension System and engineered it to work seamlessly with your handlebars. The Kinekt Stem will smooth out gravel grades, chip seal roads, cracked pavement, and all rough riding surfaces. Our engineers used our patented parallelogram design to deliver vibration isolation. It will keep you both comfortable and in control. You get precise steering for the confidence you want to tame any terrain.The Kinekt Stem spring system absorbs uncomfortable bumps and jolts and actually improves the way your bike handles. You get a more comfortable ride and better handling, and you DON'T need proprietary damper cartridges, heavy and expensive fork upgrades, or complicated wheel and tire modifications. It's simple and it works! The Kinekt Stem in action  Now you can handle all sorts of challenging roads, trails, and terrain with confidence. The Kinekt Active Suspension Stem effectively isolates your body from all sorts of jarring bumps and vibrations, improving comfort, control, and traction. You get 20mm of active travel, and the patented parallelogram design ensures torsional rigidity for optimal control.   In the past, bad roads have reduced the fun PERFECT FOR:  GRAVEL • E-BIKE • COMMUTER • TANDEM • PERFORMANCE ROAD BIKES   Here's the best way to make your riding partners jealous
Engineered for Comfort! 
 

 

 

 

 
 

 Bike parts shouldn't be complicated to use--we want every cyclist to enjoy our stem. So we designed it to be super easy to install and adjust. All it takes is a 2.5mm Allen wrench to swap out springs. Every Kinekt Stem comes with three spring options (soft, medium, and firm), so you can quickly tune your ride based on the terrain, your bike, and your preferred riding style.  


 

 
 
SPECIFICATIONS The Kinekt Stem is designed around a standard 1 ⅛” bicycle steerer tube with a 31.8mm handlebar clamp diameter. Our 7° rise stem is available in three lengths: 90mm, 105mm, and 120mm. Our 30° rise stem comes in a 100mm length. All 4 stems are made with:
Lightweight 6061-T6 aluminum
High-quality IGUS bushings
Stainless steel hardware
  Supporters can choose from 4 sizes to fit any bike and rider FEATURESEach Kinekt Stem provides 20mm of active travel in a durable, maintenance-free package.

<h2>With Great Power Comes Great Capacity</h2>
<h2><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537813023/ihje3vkh5qtkrmwqbbel.jpg"" src=""""/> </span></h2>
<p>WAU is designed with what at first glance seems to be a <strong>minimalist approach</strong> in design. But look a little closer and you will find a<strong> sparkle of magic. </strong></p>
<p><strong>WAU patented</strong> high-grade case allows the high-capacity lithium-ion battery cell, computer chips, controller, wiring, glowing logos<strong>, </strong>and <strong>all security units</strong> to all to sit <strong>perfectly flush</strong> in the center of the bike frame in an <strong>ultra slim case</strong> without any bulky add-ons.</p>
<p><strong>Ideal weight distribution</strong> allows WAU not only to remain fairly lightweight but also improves on the aerodynamic performance, power distribution and overall provide <strong>great riding control</strong> on the bike while on the road.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Maybe Size Does Matter</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537813208/zj5kpuiboejpheeuut07.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>WAU <strong>welcomes every rider.</strong> The <strong>frame is lowered</strong> to give a <strong>sporty angle</strong> and allow riders to <strong>get on </strong>and<strong> off easily.</strong> Seat drops down to <strong>83cm</strong> and all the way <strong>up to 110cm</strong>. Adjustable handlebar height easily adjusts 90-degree angle. You can customize your ride how you prefer. For long, low, aerodynamic rides or upright, relaxed cruising, you will always feel good. To put it simply, <strong>perfect comfort</strong> for <strong>riders </strong>anywhere between <strong>5.1 feet (155cm)</strong> and <strong>6.7 feet (204cm)</strong> in height. </p>
<p>All part built with high precision, high strength aluminum.</p>

With Great Power Comes Great Capacity
 
WAU is designed with what at first glance seems to be a minimalist approach in design. But look a little closer and you will find a sparkle of magic. 
WAU patented high-grade case allows the high-capacity lithium-ion battery cell, computer chips, controller, wiring, glowing logos, and all security units to all to sit perfectly flush in the center of the bike frame in an ultra slim case without any bulky add-ons.
Ideal weight distribution allows WAU not only to remain fairly lightweight but also improves on the aerodynamic performance, power distribution and overall provide great riding control on the bike while on the road.
 
Maybe Size Does Matter

WAU welcomes every rider. The frame is lowered to give a sporty angle and allow riders to get on and off easily. Seat drops down to 83cm and all the way up to 110cm. Adjustable handlebar height easily adjusts 90-degree angle. You can customize your ride how you prefer. For long, low, aerodynamic rides or upright, relaxed cruising, you will always feel good. To put it simply, perfect comfort for riders anywhere between 5.1 feet (155cm) and 6.7 feet (204cm) in height. 
All part built with high precision, high strength aluminum.
 
The Vision Is Brighter Than Ever

WAU bike comes equipped with a large daytime and night-time LCD Display that shows battery life in %, distance covered, speed, has built-in USB charger, 5-speed settings, anytime access to advanced personal setting and much more. 
 
Be Bright, Be Bold

Our unique Super-lights have a few tricks up their sleeves. Automatic color change technology changes color immediately upon your request. Turning lights, braking lights, running lights and hazards if needed, all for you in a sexy, fully water & shatter-proof package. 
Bettering your journey just that little bit more.

<p>I have lived in San Diego for over a decade now, and the weather is nearly always ideal for motorcycle riding. Yet one thing has always puzzled me:</p>
<p>Where are all the <i>electric</i> motorcycles???</p>
<p>I mean, there are motorcycles <i>everywhere</i>, and there is also a large abundance of electric cars, yet I rarely see any electric motorcycles. Why not? The climate doesnt get any better than here. I would think that this place is the<i> ideal</i> place to ride an electric motorcycle. The funny thing is, nearly EVERY time I ride my bike, someone always stops me to check it out. The first words I hear from them are ""I never knew anything like this existed!""</p>
<p>For years I have wanted to change this. I even started a website called <a href=""http://www.ElMoto.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ElMoto.net</a>, so that people could come from around the globe and share news and information.</p>
<p>Now is finally the time to go a step further</p>

Funny thing is, o<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">ut of the handful of electric motorcycle companies out there currently producing street legal models, there is no one building cruiser style motorcycles.

<p>As a single mother there are so many challenges. One of the greatest is when your child faces a health crisis. My daughter Aya was born with Sickle Cell Anemia, a blood disorder that does not have a medical cure however there are many procedures that have addressed this disease including bone marrow transplants. One of the stresses that follows a sickle cell child is pain crisis. My daughter, Aya began experiencing this painful ordeal from the age of three, she would experience pain in numerous parts of her body. Sometimes it would be in her leg, stomach, arm, and chest. The ordeal would start with pain that would escalate and get worse. I would have to take her to the hospital they would  admit her and the process would begin. Generally they would hydrate her and give pain medication to reduce the pain Aya would always require oxygen, because of the pain she would not take deep breathes. The older Aya got the stays at the hospital increased and I was not able to do anything to help my child. Something inside of me charged me to observe everything while in the hospital in detail, One of the things that I noticed over and over was my child inability to breath comfortably through the devices that were used, she hated them! I watched and watched and she complained, there was always a struggle.    It occurred to me that if a device could help, be child friendly and could deliver the necessary and critical oxygen that my child needed, then this would be great. This was the beginning phase of my idea. I was and remain excited to develop this oxygen support device to help patients who must get oxygen to recover. Thus the beginning of the AyaMed support device, although this desire grew out of personal experience with my daughter I am convinced that it would change the outlook for all patients in need of oxygen. The device can be utilized by the common user in a simple and effortless manner with little or no training. It is time for an improved instrument for the delivery of oxygen! Choosing the right type of equipment for you and your lifestyle is very important, the right oxygen equipment can play a major role in improving quality of life and saving lives. I believe that AyaMed, Inc has the innovation to make this happen. It is simple But I believe so effective! On August 1,  2012 Aya went through a bone marrow transplant and now cured of sickle cell anemia. Our mission is develop an improved respiratory device for delivery of oxygen for patients suffering from respiratory disorders and patients that are prescribed oxygen in order to compensate for their inability to breathe normally during periods of elevated levels of pain or discomfort. </p>

The

path to a freer and more secure data exchange while
still being user-friendly.
Qabel GmbH, based in Hanover, Germany, will thereby attempt to patch
a fundamental flaw of the internet. Not only the NSA and other
intelligence organizations and agencies, but especially the platform
providers themselves, will no longer have access to user data.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The
Qabel approach</b></p>
<p>The
concept Qabel is a ready to use ecosystem with inherent, true data
privacy. The world's first software platform is being developed
that makes communication and data exchange on the internet as
technically safe as currently
possible and thus
easy to use. It is a free, open-source (not in accordance with the OSI), expandable platform that:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>always
	encrypts any data end-to-end,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>does
	the cryptography completely on the client side and keeps it in the
	hands of users,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provides
	the basis for complex services such as shared calendars,
	collaborative office or social networks,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>can
	largely obscure metadata (even from the host – it is not
	discernible who communicates with whom, when, and from where to
	where),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whose
	entire technical architecture assumes that the provider
	is compromised and thus cannot be trusted,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pursues
	a novel and as open as possible business model that not only permits
	compliant open source development but also free use and hosting by
	non-commercial organizations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and
	functions across hosts and instances.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><br/>Qabel
met challenges at the levels of technology, licensing and
monetarization and offers private people, open-source developers and
businesses to make the platform their own. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Why
do we need your support?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Qabel
will firstly
be launched as an
alpha

maturity. <br/></p><p>With
release of the version 1.0, also the operating systems Android,
Ubuntu for Phones, FirefoxOS, Linux, MacOS, Windows

will be supported.
Furthermore, the user interface is a

steckt hinter dem Projekt?

Die
ursprüngliche Idee für Qabel wurde Anfang 2011 im Rahmen eines
Teammeetings des Datenschutzunternehmens praemandatum formuliert.

An Qabel arbeiten derzeit 40 Leute aus den Bereichen Softwareentwicklung, Ethik, Recht, Marketing und Vertrieb. Das
Crowfunding-Team besteht aus Meike (Vertrieb), Britta (Marketing), Dennis (Technik) und Peter (the Boss). 
 Bei Rückfragen wendet euch gern an uns: kontakt@qabel.de
Die Qabel GmbH hat
folgende Teilhaber:
- praemandatum GmbH
41%
- Peter Leppelt 15%
- Michael Wessel Informationstechnologie GmbH 13%
- hannover innovation fonds GmbH (HIF) 1%
- Weitere stille
private Teilhaber (weder aus Politik noch sonstigen
Kontrollinstanzen) 30% 


Was ist beim Crowdfunding zu beachten?

Damit Qabel unabhängig bleibt, unterstützt uns bitte immer nur als Privatperson und nicht im Namen eines Unternehmens.

Als glühende Verfechter des Datenschutzes müssen wir darauf hinweisen, dass die Bezahlmöglichkeiten bei indiegogo nicht zufriedenstellend sind. Eine Kreditkarte hat nicht jeder und PayPal entspricht nicht unseren Vorstellungen von Datenschutz. Wir haben uns auf Grund der großen Reichweite dennoch für eine Finanzierung über Indiegogo entschieden.Die Dankeschöns für deine Unterstützung werden dir ein paar Wochen nach Ende der Kampagne zugesandt. Das Handtuch (42 €-Perk), was es zu ergattern gibt, ist 70x140cm groß und wird so aussehen:Der Hoodie (100 €-Perk) mit Katze und Logo wird so aussehen:Oder *NEU* ihr könnt auch einen Hoodie (100 €-Perk) mit kleinem Qabel-Logo wählen:*NEU* *NEU* hier das Design unseres T-Shirts (80 €-Perk) mit Aufdruck: ""Das Internet ist kaputt"". Das T-Shirt wird schwarz werden, den Schnitt zeigen wir euch schnellstmöglich.Wir freuen uns über eure Unterstützung und ein freieres Internet!ENGLISH VERSIONMore digital autonomy
with Qabel – from
alpha to 1.0

Qabel
is a ready to use ecosystem with inherent data privacy – the
first software
platform that makes
communication and data exchange on the internet as technically safe
as
possible.




The
situation


The
internet is broken. When the Qabel alpha
version is launched June 11, 2014, it will mark a serious step on the
path to a freer and more secure data exchange while
still being user-friendly.
Qabel GmbH, based in Hanover, Germany, will thereby attempt to patch
a fundamental flaw of the internet. Not only the NSA and other
intelligence organizations and agencies, but especially the platform
providers themselves, will no longer have access to user data.

The
Qabel approach
The
concept Qabel is a ready to use ecosystem with inherent, true data
privacy. The world's first software platform is being developed
that makes communication and data exchange on the internet as
technically safe as currently
possible and thus
easy to use. It is a free, open-source (not in accordance with the OSI), expandable platform that:



always
	encrypts any data end-to-end,


does
	the cryptography completely on the client side and keeps it in the
	hands of users,


provides
	the basis for complex services such as shared calendars,
	collaborative office or social networks,


can
	largely obscure metadata (even from the host – it is not
	discernible who communicates with whom, when, and from where to
	where),


whose
	entire technical architecture assumes that the provider
	is compromised and thus cannot be trusted,


pursues
	a novel and as open as possible business model that not only permits
	compliant open source development but also free use and hosting by
	non-commercial organizations


and
	functions across hosts and instances.

Qabel
met challenges at the levels of technology, licensing and
monetarization and offers private people, open-source developers and
businesses to make the platform their own. 


Why
do we need your support?

Qabel
will firstly
be launched as an
alpha
version. Parallel to the feedback and improvements coming from the
community, a code auditing will be commissioned to take Qabel to 1.0
maturity. With
release of the version 1.0, also the operating systems Android,
Ubuntu for Phones, FirefoxOS, Linux, MacOS, Windows
and Windows Phone
will be supported.
Furthermore, the user interface is a
placeholder. It will be scrapped and completely redesigned.
The
development of Qabel
is associated with considerable costs.
So
we need your support to conquer
 the
internet back
together! Fund,
spread the word and participate in
the alpha testing!

What
is our goal and who is our target group?

Goal:
More digital autonomy! Mass surveillance
and data preservation need to end!

Target
group: Everybody who uses the internet.

Why
should you support this project?

Because
things like constitutional state, civil rights, freedom of speech and
the right for free opinion are worthy of preservation and
development.

„It
is alarming that hardly anyone knows what data is stored about them.
It is extremely alarming that hardly anyone knows who owns this data
at this point in time. It is not alarming, however, that only a
minority takes defensive measures. This is dramatic.“
(Götz Hamann, Marcus Rohwetter, DIE ZEIT, 48/2004; free translation
of the german quote!)""They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety."" (Benjamin Franklin)Who
is behind Qabel?

The
original idea came up in early 2011 during a team meeting of the
company praemandatum.
 – a company specialized
in
data security.

At
the moment, 40 people are working on
Qabel. They work in
the departments software development, ethics, law, marketing and
distribution. The crowdfunding team consists of Meike (distribution),
Britta (marketing), Dennis (software) and Peter (the boss). If you
have any
questions, please don't hesitate to
contact us: kontakt@qabel.de

to note regarding this crowdfunding project?To
keep Qabel independent, we only ask private individuals – and no
companies - to fund this project on Indiegogo. 

As
passionate proponents of data security we have to point out, that the
options of payment  on Indiegogo are not satisfying. Not everyone
has a credit card, and PayPal
does not conform with our opinion on
data security. The reason why we still chose
Indiegogo is to have a wide reach, because our idea is not only a
matter of just a few. You will receive your ordered Perks a few weeks after the end of the crowdfunding.The towel (42 € perk) will look like this:The hoodie with cat and logo (100 € perk) will look like this: NEW: You also can choose a hoodie with a small logo (100 € perk):*NEW* *NEW* here is the design of our t-shirt (80 € perk) with the German print: ""Das Internet ist kaputt"" = ""The internet is broken"". The t-shirt will be black. We will show you the shirt style asap.We
are looking forward to your support and a freer internet!",8.0,1,"1 Campaign

Click here to download the Gi FlyBike mobile app from the App Store or Google Play. Please keep in mind that it is a work in progress, and that it needs to be synched with a Gi FlyBike to be fully-functional.
The app allows for complete, wireless control of the bike’s features including its electric assistance, smart lock, bicycle navigation system and smart lights. On top of that, it has its own bike sharing program: loan your Gi FlyBike to a friend with a secure request access code; share your favorite routes over social media; and track your personal fitness statistics.


All of these features come together to create an enjoyable commuting experience. Imagine: you get off your elevator with your folded FlyBike; you unfold the bike in one second, choose your route, and start cycling towards your destination; you do not want to arrive sweaty so you increase your level of electric assistance; the sun begins to set so you turn on your smart lights; you've arrived cool, calm and collected, and with a fully-charged phone. As you dismount and fold your bike, it locks automatically; you are finished with your FlyBike... for now, but a friend wants to borrow it so you share it through the app. You enjoyed commuting. Now its their turn.




Gi FlyBike is not just a sustainable, technologically-advanced solution to commuting in cities. Gi FlyBike symbolizes our desire to change the world for the better. Commuting can affect our outlook on the day ahead but more importantly, it impacts our perspective, society, and planet. With Gi FlyBike we believe that thoughtful design and technology can take us into the next generation of transportation, to create more effective and eco-friendly cities with happier people.




A few years ago, while we were living and working in Argentina, a national strike paralyzed public transportation across the country. The strike inspired us to delve into the kinds of problems commuters face, and to critically examine alternative forms of transportation.
During and even after the strike, we noticed that commuters wanted the kind of independence that is incompatible with public transit; they also wanted agility that cars cannot offer, with as little environmental impact as possible. This has been the inspiration behind the design of Gi FlyBike.

Our Evolution: Paper to Wood to Plastic to Aluminum!






Please note: Backers are responsible for sales taxes and import duties, which will vary according to the country, state or province to which the reward is being shipped. Please use the following duty calculator to determine the estimated import duties and taxes for pedal assisted electric bicycles in your respective region.


The funds raised will be used for: 

Producing factory samples.
Running sample testing and homologation. 
Finalizing the design of the FlyBike mobile app for Android.
Developing an e-commerce platform. 
Creating an international network of service stores.
Mass production and distribution.

Additional funds will be used for:

Broadening our international network of service stores.
Designing an environmentally low-impact packaging system.
Creating a line of accessories.


We created Gi FlyBike with a minimalistic design, prioritizing the functionality over the aesthetics. After two years of work, we came up with a design specially built with the comfort, safety, and ease of use that daily commuters deserve.

INNOVATION ACT</p>
<p>SECTION
1. <span>  STATEMENT
OF FINDINGS</span></p>
<p>A.<span>  California
bureaucrats have embarked on a multi-billion dollar project to bring
“high-speed” rail to fruition.  The
project was just barely approved by the voters in 2008.  Since then, costs estimates have
sky-rocketed, the promises made in Proposition 1A have been broke, and initial
planning for the system shows that it will be over-budget, overdue, and will
not be “high-speed” or energy efficient. 
</span></p>
<p>B.<span>  While
California wastes billions of taxpayer funds on old transportation technology,
new technologies are being developed and employed in other cities, states, and
countries.  These technologies,
including hyper-loop, evacuated tube technology, local area personal rapid
transit, among others, do not require billions of taxpayer dollars -- they
merely require vision and leadership.</span></p>
<p>C.<span>  As
the technology capital of the world, California should be leading the
development of energy efficient, high-speed transportation systems.  Yet, California has no regulatory
framework to allow for private investment and development of these innovative
transportation technologies. The billions the government plans to spend on old
technology is creating economic disincentive for competition and innovation.</span></p>
<p>D.<span>  If
allowed to compete, head-to-head, with “high-speed” rail, these innovative
technologies, will prove to be:</span></p>
<p><span>  </span></p>
<p><span>  1)
Faster and more reliable: 
Hyper-loop and evacuated tube technology can achieve speeds matching or
exceeding those of commercial airplanes.  </span></p>
<p><span>  </span></p>
<p><span>  2)
Energy efficient:  Measured by
energy consumed per passenger-mile, these new innovative technologies will be
significantly more energy efficient than high-speed rail, which is not much
more efficient than passenger cars and planes.  </span></p>
<p><span>  3)
Flexible:  High-Speed-Rail systems
are not flexible to allow frequent access points as frequent stops between
major cities result in long travel times and/or reduced throughput.  Also High-Speed-Rail track and
infrastructure are extremely costly regardless of consumer demand.  New technologies are flexible to offer
frequent points of accessibility, and are much less expensive; thus frequent
access points can be adapted to fit consumer demand without reducing travel
time or capacity.</span></p>
<p><span>  4)
Less costly:  Rail will cost tens,
if not hundreds, of billions of taxpayer dollars to construct and will require
taxpayer subsidies to operate.  The
construction costs for these new technologies is so much lower, there is NO
cost to taxpayers because the private sector will fund construction and
operation.  All the government
needs to do is provide right-of-way for the systems and inspect the
construction and operation of the systems to insure public safety.  </span></p>
<p>SECTION
2. <span>  STATEMENT
OF PURPOSE</span></p>
<p>The
people hereby enact the “Transportation Innovation Act” to:</p>
<p><span>  1)
Suspend the further issuance of bonds and construction of the high-speed rail
system beyond the first leg that has been planned, in order to allow for the
construction and operation of a pilot project using different technology so the
voters can compare the cost, efficiency, and reliability of the two systems;</span></p>
<p><span>  2)
Empower the state to obtain necessary right-of-way and to provide for the inspection
of the construction and operation of new transportation technologies to insure
public safety.</span></p>
<p>SECTION
3.<span>  SUSPENSION
OF HIGH-SPEED RAIL BOND ISSUANCE AND CONSTRUCTION</span></p>
<p><span>  Section
2705 is added to Chapter 20 of Division 3 of the Streets and Highways Code, to
read:</span></p>
<p>§
2705(a)<span>  Notwithstanding any
provision of this chapter, or any other law, no bonds authorized by this
chapter shall be sold to pay the capital costs associated with the construction
of any high-speed train system or line, except for any segment of such a
system, under construction at the time of the enactment of this section.  </span></p>
<p>(b)
The Authority, with the consent of the Legislature, may continue the
construction of a segment of the high-speed train system pursuant to this
chapter, for purposes of demonstration and comparison with other transportation
technologies to be developed pursuant to the Transportation Innovation Act.</p>
<p>(c)
Upon completion and operation of a comparable system, or within eight years, whichever
is later, the Legislature, upon a two-thirds vote, may repeal this section.</p>
<p>SECTION
4.<span>  THE
TRANSPORTATION INNOVATION ACT</span></p>
<p><span>  Division
26 (commencing with section 260000) of the Public Utilities Code is added to
read:</span></p>
<p>§
260000.<span>  The
Public Utilities Commission shall pursuant to this division and regulations
enacted by the Commission:</span></p>
<p><span>  (1)
Within one year from enactment of this section, make existing right-of-way
owned or maintained by the state or acquire new right-of-way, for the
development of pilot projects using high-speed and/or high-efficient,
transportation technologies (“HS/HE transportation technologies”) including,
but not limited to, hyper-loop, evacuated tube technology, and local area
personal rapid transit technology;</span></p>

I am licensee #100 and the current COO of ET3 Global Alliance Inc. ET3 is short for Evacuated Tube Transport Technologies (et3.com).I am the organizer of this campaign to Legalize Transport Innovation. The above video is my BBC World News interview that came on the heels of the world wide media sensation caused by Elon Musk's Hyperloop in August. That was a big day for me, but it won't be nearly as big as the day in 2016 when we open the first 3 mile 375mph demo of ET3, currently in negotiations to break ground this winter somewhere near Las Vegas.I learned about ET3 three years ago when I attempted to run for congress. I remember asking myself why am I even running for congress? That's what happened. I ended my campaign, bought an ET3 license, and got to work trying to get it built. What I found is the barriers to innovation in transport are all political. This campaign's main purpose is to raise the the legal funds necessary to draft a California Proposition that will create the legal framework for the spread of the physical internet.  In the future Tube Transport (300 - 4,000mph) will be like fiber optics, and local area Personal Rapid Transit (25 - 55 mph) will be like cell phone towers. It can all be privately funded and solar powered. There is an art to drafting an initiative and having it properly submitted to the Attorney General of CA, so I have hired an exceptional Sacramento election law attorney  Thomas W. Hiltachk. Below is the Transportation Innovation Act. If you like what you read help out the campaign with a contribution!Another purpose of the campaign is fill the demand for ET3 logo apparel for all of our licensees and supporters. This is currently the only place where you can get ET3 hoodies, hats, shirts, and stickers. We need our supporters out there wearing the ET3 logo and talking to people. This is grass roots organizing. Get your uniforms here. If you are interested in one of the higher priced perks ($1,000+) please contact me so I can explain current state of demo project and answer any questions you may have regarding ET3. I have gotten the approval to offer for a limited time small areas on the seats and the outside of the first demo for personalized messages. There is an amazing PR opportunity here for someone that sees this is happening. LIKE the ET3 Facebook Page and interact with our community there. THE TRANSPORTATION
INNOVATION ACT
SECTION
1.   STATEMENT
OF FINDINGS
A.  California
bureaucrats have embarked on a multi-billion dollar project to bring
“high-speed” rail to fruition.  The
project was just barely approved by the voters in 2008.  Since then, costs estimates have
sky-rocketed, the promises made in Proposition 1A have been broke, and initial
planning for the system shows that it will be over-budget, overdue, and will
not be “high-speed” or energy efficient. 

B.  While
California wastes billions of taxpayer funds on old transportation technology,
new technologies are being developed and employed in other cities, states, and
countries.  These technologies,
including hyper-loop, evacuated tube technology, local area personal rapid
transit, among others, do not require billions of taxpayer dollars -- they
merely require vision and leadership.
C.  As
the technology capital of the world, California should be leading the
development of energy efficient, high-speed transportation systems.  Yet, California has no regulatory
framework to allow for private investment and development of these innovative
transportation technologies. The billions the government plans to spend on old
technology is creating economic disincentive for competition and innovation.
D.  If
allowed to compete, head-to-head, with “high-speed” rail, these innovative
technologies, will prove to be:
  
  1)
Faster and more reliable: 
Hyper-loop and evacuated tube technology can achieve speeds matching or
exceeding those of commercial airplanes.  
  
  2)
Energy efficient:  Measured by
energy consumed per passenger-mile, these new innovative technologies will be
significantly more energy efficient than high-speed rail, which is not much
more efficient than passenger cars and planes.  
  3)
Flexible:  High-Speed-Rail systems
are not flexible to allow frequent access points as frequent stops between
major cities result in long travel times and/or reduced throughput.  Also High-Speed-Rail track and
infrastructure are extremely costly regardless of consumer demand.  New technologies are flexible to offer
frequent points of accessibility, and are much less expensive; thus frequent
access points can be adapted to fit consumer demand without reducing travel
time or capacity.
  4)
Less costly:  Rail will cost tens,
if not hundreds, of billions of taxpayer dollars to construct and will require
taxpayer subsidies to operate.  The
construction costs for these new technologies is so much lower, there is NO
cost to taxpayers because the private sector will fund construction and
operation.  All the government
needs to do is provide right-of-way for the systems and inspect the
construction and operation of the systems to insure public safety.  
SECTION
2.   STATEMENT
OF PURPOSE
The
people hereby enact the “Transportation Innovation Act” to:
  1)
Suspend the further issuance of bonds and construction of the high-speed rail
system beyond the first leg that has been planned, in order to allow for the
construction and operation of a pilot project using different technology so the
voters can compare the cost, efficiency, and reliability of the two systems;
  2)
Empower the state to obtain necessary right-of-way and to provide for the inspection
of the construction and operation of new transportation technologies to insure
public safety.
SECTION
3.  SUSPENSION
OF HIGH-SPEED RAIL BOND ISSUANCE AND CONSTRUCTION
  Section
2705 is added to Chapter 20 of Division 3 of the Streets and Highways Code, to
read:
§
2705(a)  Notwithstanding any
provision of this chapter, or any other law, no bonds authorized by this
chapter shall be sold to pay the capital costs associated with the construction
of any high-speed train system or line, except for any segment of such a
system, under construction at the time of the enactment of this section.  
(b)
The Authority, with the consent of the Legislature, may continue the
construction of a segment of the high-speed train system pursuant to this
chapter, for purposes of demonstration and comparison with other transportation
technologies to be developed pursuant to the Transportation Innovation Act.
(c)
Upon completion and operation of a comparable system, or within eight years, whichever
is later, the Legislature, upon a two-thirds vote, may repeal this section.
SECTION
4.  THE
TRANSPORTATION INNOVATION ACT
  Division
26 (commencing with section 260000) of the Public Utilities Code is added to

<p>Building a machine with electric motors? If so, ever wanted a motor drive that can control virtually any kind of motor you can come across? <br/>
</p>
<p>We know that this kind of drive has been hard to find, but luckily not any more! The fearless goal of IONI project is to make an versatile drive that can control most of low voltage electric motors: DC/AC/brushless/linear servo motors and stepping motors.</p>
<p>IONI allows controlling motors in all <a href=""http://granitedevices.com/wiki/Control_modes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">three operating modes</a>: position control, velocity control and torque control (torque mode only with servo motors). Applications of such control methods include</p>
<ul>
<li>Position control, such as CNC and 3D printing</li>
<li>Velocity control, such as spindles or vehicle wheels<br/>
</li>
<li>Force / torque control, such as racing simulator wheel</li>
</ul>

<br/>Commands to IONI drive can be delivered in many formats and from many sources, such as PC, microcontroller (i.e. Arduino,  MBED) or Raspberry Pi. IONI understands several forms of commands:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Step &amp; direction digital signals (typical stepper drive interface, good for position control)</li>
<li>Analog +/-10V signal (good for speed or torque control)</li>
<li>PWM signal (good for speed or torque control)</li>
<li>RS485 serial bus (talks <a href=""http://granitedevices.com/wiki/SimpleMotion_V2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SimpleMotion V2</a> bus protocol, open source library available)</li>

<h4>IONI Pro</h4>
<p>This is the motor controller with similar connector that PCI-Express 
8x uses. The electrical interface is not PCI-Express compatible, but a 
custom interface specified <a href=""http://granitedevices.com/wiki/IONI_connector_pinout"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.
 IONI Pro differs from IONI (standard) by feature set. At the present 
moment, features of IONI Pro and IONI are similar, but as time goes on, 
more features will be added to the Pro model as downloadable upgrades.

<h2>Choosing a motor<br/>
</h2>
<p>As motor is not included, make sure that you have, or obtain a motor that is compatible with IONI. <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/ioni-a-next-generation-servo-motor-drive/edit/%28learn%20more"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Learn more about motor types</a>.<br/></p>
<p>Servo motor requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Permanent magnet brush-DC, AC, brushless or linear motor</li>
<li>Motor voltage rating 12-60 VDC (IONI supply voltage is 5 - 52 VDC)<br/>
</li>
<li>Motor current rating 0.5 - 15A (IONI maximum output is 15A)<br/>
</li>
<li>Servo motor must be equipped with an incremental encoder (position sensor) with resolution of 100 to 1000000 pulses per revolution.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Stepping motor requirements:<br/></p>
<ul><li>Two-phase stepping motor with 0.5 - 10A current rating, no feedback device needed. Can be used in position and velocity control mode. Torque mode not possible. Stepper voltage rating is irrelevant, but generally lower voltage &amp; higher current stepper is better.<br/>
</li></ul>
<p>Unsuitable/non-optimum motors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any non-permanent magnet motors: induction AC motor or DC motor with field coil - will not work<br/>
</li>
<li>Cheapest grade DC motor, such as one extracted from power drill - might not give satisfying performance<br/>
</li>
<li>Motor with very high voltage, such as 200 VAC AC servo motor - it will work if it has incremental encoder feedback, but maximum rotation speed is limited due to drive voltage.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>

</div><br/></div>","The motor drive for all of your projects

Building a machine with electric motors? If so, ever wanted a motor drive that can control virtually any kind of motor you can come across? 

We know that this kind of drive has been hard to find, but luckily not any more! The fearless goal of IONI project is to make an versatile drive that can control most of low voltage electric motors: DC/AC/brushless/linear servo motors and stepping motors.
IONI allows controlling motors in all three operating modes: position control, velocity control and torque control (torque mode only with servo motors). Applications of such control methods include

Position control, such as CNC and 3D printing
Velocity control, such as spindles or vehicle wheels

Force / torque control, such as racing simulator wheel



Commands to IONI drive can be delivered in many formats and from many sources, such as PC, microcontroller (i.e. Arduino,  MBED) or Raspberry Pi. IONI understands several forms of commands:
Step & direction digital signals (typical stepper drive interface, good for position control)
Analog +/-10V signal (good for speed or torque control)
PWM signal (good for speed or torque control)
RS485 serial bus (talks SimpleMotion V2 bus protocol, open source library available)

Stretch goals


Devices



IONI Pro
This is the motor controller with similar connector that PCI-Express 
8x uses. The electrical interface is not PCI-Express compatible, but a 
custom interface specified here.
 IONI Pro differs from IONI (standard) by feature set. At the present 
moment, features of IONI Pro and IONI are similar, but as time goes on, 
more features will be added to the Pro model as downloadable upgrades. 
See product page and  full tech specifications.



IONICUBE
IONICUBE is a motherboard to carry up to four IONI drives and provide user friendly terminals and 
connectors. The four axis design is especially suitable for multiaxis 
systems such as PC controlled CNC machines. Features & more info.


IONICUBE 1X
IONICUBE 1X is a motherboard to carry one IONI drive and provide user friendly terminals and 
connectors. IONICUBE 1X is the choice for the single axis systems such as motorized racing simulator wheels or a distributed motor control. IONICUBE 1X is under development thus it has longer delivery time than the 4 axis model. 



Choosing a motor

As motor is not included, make sure that you have, or obtain a motor that is compatible with IONI. Learn more about motor types.
Servo motor requirements:

Permanent magnet brush-DC, AC, brushless or linear motor
Motor voltage rating 12-60 VDC (IONI supply voltage is 5 - 52 VDC)

Motor current rating 0.5 - 15A (IONI maximum output is 15A)

Servo motor must be equipped with an incremental encoder (position sensor) with resolution of 100 to 1000000 pulses per revolution.


Stepping motor requirements:
Two-phase stepping motor with 0.5 - 10A current rating, no feedback device needed. Can be used in position and velocity control mode. Torque mode not possible. Stepper voltage rating is irrelevant, but generally lower voltage & higher current stepper is better.

Unsuitable/non-optimum motors:

Any non-permanent magnet motors: induction AC motor or DC motor with field coil - will not work

Cheapest grade DC motor, such as one extracted from power drill - might not give satisfying performance

Motor with very high voltage, such as 200 VAC AC servo motor - it will work if it has incremental encoder feedback, but maximum rotation speed is limited due to drive voltage.




Demo

See a short demo of running various motors with the popular Mach3 CNC software:


The IONI advantage

Simplified wiring & software configuration work
Effortless upgrade from stepper based system to servo motors with minimal changes (utilizing existing step/dir control)

Expandability - add more axis as needed, up to 32 by chaining IONICUBES

Serviceability - replacing a drive is doable in less than a minute
Industrial grade performance - this drive seconds to nothing when it's compared to it's peers
Low heating - even with highest loads, a fan cooling is sufficient and with low loads, passive cooling will do
Reliability - IONI bas been ruggedized against: output short circuit, supply voltage error, over temperature and ESD

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Beth, and here is my story!</p>
<p>I'm a 25 year old single mom whose life was almost taken and was changed forever at the hands of another driver. My parents had gotten me a massage for my very first Mother's Day. I had turned my phone off, and was excited to relax for the first time in months after taking care of my prematurely born son. I was going the speed limit on a high way and another driver didn't like that.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">This vehicle tailgated me so close that I could see he had gauges in his ear lobes. He then proceeded to swerve around me as I was trying to get into a slower lane of traffic to let him pass. It <i>should </i>have ended right there. But it didn't. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">His rage was so overpowering and he wanted to ""teach me a lesson"" so badly, that he purposely and forcefully hard-slammed on his brakes. I, thank the Lord, saw his brake lights in time to swerve and miss hitting his vehicle, but was unable to regain control of my vehicle. I ended up crossing<i> two lanes of high way traffic</i> and<i> flying through the air </i>into the median in which<b><i> my vehicle rolled 4 times</i></b> (according to witnesses). Long story not-so-short: <i>the driver drove away</i>, however, witnesses got his plate number. A State Trooper tracked this man down and asked him if he saw me rolling. The man replied <b>""Yeah, I saw her, and that's what she gets!""</b>. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">This was the weekend of Mother's Day. It was my first Mother's Day. I'm a single mom. I had a very well displayed ""Baby On Board"" sticker on my now pancaked vehicle. This man said that I got what I deserved because I was going 65 mph in a 65 mph speed limit zone on my way to celebrate my first Mother's Day with a massage my parents bought for me. <b><i>A complete stranger wanted me dead and my child orphaned because of something that took two seconds of his time on the high way. Two seconds. My life will never be the same because of two seconds.</i></b></span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>With all of that being said, I would like to, and for my own emotional well-being I need to, start/help with/coordinate be a part of some kind of <b>anti road rage campaign!!!</b> I know road rage happens on a daily, hourly, minute to minute basis and that this is a HUGE problem that can be worsened <b>or</b> lessened all in two seconds. </p>
<p>I would be honored if I could help save just one life from being ruined forever, like mine has.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am on a CRUSADE and I won't stop until I make a difference and save lives!! I intend to make bumper stickers, t-shirts, educational materials, etc. I will collaborate with State Highway Departments, as well as Police Departments, driving schools to get the word out that this IS a problem and people DO die!</p>
<p>I do have medical bills that I have been getting collection calls for, but I would ONLY use this fund if I get OVER my goal!</p>

<p>Product Designers Nav &amp; Jack created Analog Motion to solve the everyday problem of living in cities; commuting. The goal was to deliver practical solutions to modern transport, allowing people to move through their city faster, easier and more efficiently than ever before. The AMX is the <strong>ultimate solution</strong>. It's <strong>powerful</strong>, <strong>beautiful</strong> and most-importantly; <strong>accessible</strong>.</p>
<p>It has been designed to deliver a ride that takes all the pain out of commuting, ensuring you arrive at your destination relaxed and with a smile on your face.</p>

<p><br/>The philosophy of the AMX is simple, it delivers a powerful electric assist and premium features whilst the lightweight design and rear hub motor allows for a natural cycling experience. The AMX is the result of a reductive design process that does away with over-engineered and under-utilised specs and instead provides simple, elegant functionality. It has a detachable battery that can be charged at your desk, a lightweight motor for smooth and consistent power, and the weight is almost half that of many electric bikes on the market.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591613871/n1mxh4irdagss23j42he.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The AMX is our next generation of e-bike. The design has been refined using the experience and customer feedback obtained in successfully delivering over 500 bikes in our initial crowdfunding campaign, and the manufacturing and fulfilment know-how learned during the process. It provides more power, speed and comfort, and includes some industry-leading features at an even more impressive price point.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Introducing <strong>the AMX MINI</strong>
</h3>
<p>Back in 2016, we set out to create the best looking, lightest, ebike and we did. You wanted more, the AMX gives you more. But some wanted… less?</p>
<p>That’s right. Bikes are not small. The AMX is already a compact 28” wheel ebike but its still 178cm from wheel to wheel. That’s as long as a 2-seater sofa. So what’s smaller than 28""? 20”. The AMX MINI is a new concept in bike design: <strong>A small bike for big cities.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ultra-compact.</strong> 138cm from wheel to wheel. That’s smaller than most folding electric bikes on the market today. Easy to carry into your flat or throw into your boot.</p>
<p><strong>Beautiful.</strong> Designing a small ebike is easy. Designing a small ebike that still looks good? Now that’s a challenge. The AMX MINI is inspired by the Mini-Velos ubiquitous in Japan. We’ve added as little as possible to make a bike that does everything.</p>
<p><strong>Ultra-lightweight.</strong> Sub-13kg.  This is lighter than most non-electric bikes!</p>
<p><strong>One size.</strong> A bike that fits anyone!</p>
<p><strong>27-mile range.</strong> Don’t let its size fool you, it's still good for a proper ride.</p>
<p><strong>Powerful.</strong> Small wheels and a high torque motor is a potent combo. The AMX MINI<strong> </strong>accelerates like no other and begs to be thrashed.<br/> </p>

<p><strong>The AMX is the latest electric bike from Analog Motion</strong>, the team that brought you the AM1 in 2018. It's been an amazing year. Now, AM1s are being ridden all over the world and our riders ❤️ it. But don’t take our word for it:</p>
<div style=""margin:5%;""><p><i>""Now the AM1 exists in its final form. They made it. They delivered loads. Others are in a shop right now. Everyone pulled through and promises were kept.

<div style=""margin:5%;""><p><i>""I‘m proud to say that the AM1 is really worth the money. It‘s easy to assemble, easy to ride, absolutely solid quality and the motor is the ultra plus. It‘s really fun to get assisted by its power, but not necessary to use the motor because the bike rides like a normal single speed. I would buy this bike over and over again.""</i><br/><strong>AM1 Backer #576</strong></p></div>
<p>We refused to compromise on the quality of the AM1 and it shows. At Analog Motion HQ we receive realtime notifications each time a new review is written. Nothing brings us more joy than reading them. Below is a small selection of the hundreds of reviews you've written for us and we can't thank you enough.</p>

<p>We've learned so much during our previous crowdfunding. Some things went smoothly, others didn't. Who knew customs clearance could take 4 weeks? Who knew shipping lithium batteries would be so complicated? We embraced the challenge and emerged victorious.</p>
<p>We're a team of designers, engineers and problem solvers and we're always developing new products to bring into the world, with your backing we can make the AMX a reality.</p>

<p>The AMX encompasses new processes; smooth welds, electronic integration, high power batteries, sliding drop-outs, tapered headsets. If these words mean something to you, you'll know how exciting it is that the AMX boasts all of them. If you don't know what these words mean, fear not; we do and they make the AMX awesome.</p>

<p>After the success of the AM1 we've fostered strong mutual relationships with our supply chain. That means we have more control over the production process, can experiment more with new manufacturing techniques and further increase quality, consistency and long term reliability.</p>

<p><strong>Payment:</strong> Tier prices above reflect the cost for the perk before taxes and duties, as these will need to be calculated based on your location prior to delivery. By dealing with this prior to shipping the AMX can be ‘delivered duty paid’ (DDP) to most countries. This allows it to clear customs smoothly on arrival which prevents hold-ups and admin charges at the border. You will be contacted prior to shipment to arrange the final balance to ensure your delivery goes as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Assembly: </strong>Our target is to provide the majority of backers in mainstream locations with bikes in a largely-assembled manner, with some final assembly required.</p>
<p>Let's be frank; bikes are a great way to get around town, but they are a challenging size and shape to transport internationally. Add to that, battery shipping regulations, oversized carton charges from couriers and duties which vary by country and depending on the level of assembly of the product, you can see how delivering bikes internationally takes planning and careful consideration</p>
<p>As we approach the time to ship AMXs, we will assess the most appropriate method to get bikes to every single one of you. This may involve regional fulfilment centres, third-country assembly, airmail, sea freight… Our decision will be chosen to provide the best solution for you so as to maximise the customer experience and minimise the taxes, duties, and shipping times</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Battery life: </strong>Durations given are based on a 75kg rider using a medium level of assist. Actual battery life will vary based on a number of factors including; rider weight, effort contributed, wind, elevation and external temperature.<br/><br/>Many of our AM1 riders have reported experiencing a much higher range than what was quoted, but we prefer to lean on the side of caution. And regardless, very few of us ever need to go as far as 20 miles on a single charge; when you do, the touring pack or a Spare Battery get you there :)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Production: </strong>All AMX models in this campaign are production samples made using the manufacturers and supply chain we have in place. There may be some changes, modifications or improvements made to the scaled manufactured version which will be shipping to all backers.</p>

From Analog Motion, who brought you the AM1 in 2018, comes the AMX, designed to eke the most out of city living. It launched on Indiegogo in September, smashed the campaign goal in 16 hours, and went on to 1500% funded with over 600 backers. The team have continued to push the AMX and get it in the hands of as many people as possible.In the hands of reviewer, Nick from Engadget;“It was enormous fun to ride I instantly started grinning as, with barely any effort, I soared past lycra-clad cyclists in London's Victoria Park.”It delighted crowds at CycleShow UK and EUROBIKE, the biggest bike show in the world. The results from test rides were incredible, with riders delighted by the power and responsiveness of the ride, and shocked at just how lightweight and manoeuvrable the AMX is.


Product Designers Nav & Jack created Analog Motion to solve the everyday problem of living in cities; commuting. The goal was to deliver practical solutions to modern transport, allowing people to move through their city faster, easier and more efficiently than ever before. The AMX is the ultimate solution. It's powerful, beautiful and most-importantly; accessible.
It has been designed to deliver a ride that takes all the pain out of commuting, ensuring you arrive at your destination relaxed and with a smile on your face.







The philosophy of the AMX is simple, it delivers a powerful electric assist and premium features whilst the lightweight design and rear hub motor allows for a natural cycling experience. The AMX is the result of a reductive design process that does away with over-engineered and under-utilised specs and instead provides simple, elegant functionality. It has a detachable battery that can be charged at your desk, a lightweight motor for smooth and consistent power, and the weight is almost half that of many electric bikes on the market.

The AMX is our next generation of e-bike. The design has been refined using the experience and customer feedback obtained in successfully delivering over 500 bikes in our initial crowdfunding campaign, and the manufacturing and fulfilment know-how learned during the process. It provides more power, speed and comfort, and includes some industry-leading features at an even more impressive price point.
 



POWERFUL
The 250W rear-wheel drive allows us to keep the traditional frame design of the bike. It gives you the boost that you need simply by pedalling. The motor has zero resistance allowing the bike to ride exactly like a regular bike when powered down ⚡️







CITY-PROOF
180mm disc brakes make sure the AMX stops as well as it goes, come rain or shine. Bigger tyres will make every road surface feel smooth and save you from unnecessary stress! The integrated lights (Add-on) will keep you visible day or night. Add mudguards (Add-on) and your AMX will conquer any urban conditions.







LIGHTWEIGHT
The AMX is light, weighing around 15kg when shared bikes (like Uber JUMP) are in excess of 25kg! This makes the AMX feel fast, agile and still easy to carry up a flight of stairs ☁️






Who needs complicated suspension when you ride mainly on the road? The 2"" wide tyres provide 30% more comfort on rough roads than traditional suspension.
Belt drive is perfect for commuting thanks to the low maintenance and lubrication-free benefits. It runs smoother, quieter, and has a much longer life than metal bicycle chains. It's the ultimate upgrade for those who refuse to compromise.
Our Limited Edition frames come in a choice of two unique and exclusive paint colours; Deep Blue and Pearl White. Both come with some exquisite extra details on the frame to ensure that it stands out from the crowd.

Introducing the AMX MINI

Back in 2016, we set out to create the best looking, lightest, ebike and we did. You wanted more, the AMX gives you more. But some wanted… less?
That’s right. Bikes are not small. The AMX is already a compact 28” wheel ebike but its still 178cm from wheel to wheel. That’s as long as a 2-seater sofa. So what’s smaller than 28""? 20”. The AMX MINI is a new concept in bike design: A small bike for big cities.




 
 

Ultra-compact. 138cm from wheel to wheel. That’s smaller than most folding electric bikes on the market today. Easy to carry into your flat or throw into your boot.
Beautiful. Designing a small ebike is easy. Designing a small ebike that still looks good? Now that’s a challenge. The AMX MINI is inspired by the Mini-Velos ubiquitous in Japan. We’ve added as little as possible to make a bike that does everything.
Ultra-lightweight. Sub-13kg.  This is lighter than most non-electric bikes!
One size. A bike that fits anyone!
27-mile range. Don’t let its size fool you, it's still good for a proper ride.
Powerful. Small wheels and a high torque motor is a potent combo. The AMX MINI accelerates like no other and begs to be thrashed. 



The Limited Edition (LE) is the AMX without compromise. Gates Carbon Drive ensures a maintenance-free, quieter drivetrain. Fitted with Schwalbe Big Apple tyres to lap-up uneven terrain. For the extra smile-on-face factor, the LE has a 15% power boost in high assist mode. The LE comes with stealth black hardware and can be specified in one of two limited paint colours: Deep Blue or Pearl White. Both boast exquisite graphic detailing on the fork and are limited to this campaign only. When they're gone, they're gone. RRP £1789
 

The MINI is the model for the all-rounder. With bigger 38C tyres, it will easily lap-up uneven terrain. Fitted with disc brakes for maximum braking and a 15% power boost in high-assist mode. The MINI is available in Carbon Black with black hardware. RRP £1599 [SOLD OUT]

Last year, we launched the AM1 ebike and delivered it to backers all around the world. Thanks to your support, the team continues to grow. The new core team has been working extra hard to bring you the AMX. 

Follow us on social media




The AMX is the latest electric bike from Analog Motion, the team that brought you the AM1 in 2018. It's been an amazing year. Now, AM1s are being ridden all over the world and our riders ❤️ it. But don’t take our word for it:
""Now the AM1 exists in its final form. They made it. They delivered loads. Others are in a shop right now. Everyone pulled through and promises were kept. There's one right here that came in the post. It's a Kickstarter story that didn't fall apart in acrimony and failure.""Gizmodo
“It may look like a regular bike, but the AM1+ packs some powerful electric features beneath the surface”Mashable
""I‘m proud to say that the AM1 is really worth the money. It‘s easy to assemble, easy to ride, absolutely solid quality and the motor is the ultra plus. It‘s really fun to get assisted by its power, but not necessary to use the motor because the bike rides like a normal single speed. I would buy this bike over and over again.""AM1 Backer #576
We refused to compromise on the quality of the AM1 and it shows. At Analog Motion HQ we receive realtime notifications each time a new review is written. Nothing brings us more joy than reading them. Below is a small selection of the hundreds of reviews you've written for us and we can't thank you enough.




We've learned so much during our previous crowdfunding. Some things went smoothly, others didn't. Who knew customs clearance could take 4 weeks? Who knew shipping lithium batteries would be so complicated? We embraced the challenge and emerged victorious.
We're a team of designers, engineers and problem solvers and we're always developing new products to bring into the world, with your backing we can make the AMX a reality.
Our prototypes are ready. Our manufacturing partner is ready. We're ready.
 

The AMX encompasses new processes; smooth welds, electronic integration, high power batteries, sliding drop-outs, tapered headsets. If these words mean something to you, you'll know how exciting it is that the AMX boasts all of them. If you don't know what these words mean, fear not; we do and they make the AMX awesome.

After the success of the AM1 we've fostered strong mutual relationships with our supply chain. That means we have more control over the production process, can experiment more with new manufacturing techniques and further increase quality, consistency and long term reliability.

 
We really hope you like the AMX and we're excited to have you join this next adventure!From all the team

Since all of our scooters are connected, you can check things like location, estimated riding range, and even anti-theft alerts straight from your phone.  Today’s launch is no rehearsal for us; we’ve been designing and building smart electric scooters since 2015. In just three short years, our scooters have clocked more than 1 billion kilometers across the globe.The NGT is our most powerful scooter. The NGT has a 3kW Bosch motor that cranks out a top speed of 70km/h, and a range of well over 100 km thanks to its 2-removable Panasonic batteries. You can easily drive all week on just a single charge of your two batteries. The NPro is the addition you were all asking for. It is an NGT that is capped at 45 km/h. No other differences, exactly the same specs. So in countries like Germany, you only need a car license to drive it, NOT a motorbike license. You asked, we listened.The M+ is the newest model in our M-Series: winner of 5+ International Design Awards. It’s sexy, practical and built for 2 riders. The M+ effortlessly zips around urban streets, boulevards and alleys at 45 km/h with a real city riding range of well over 100 km.The NGT and M+ are both equipped with industry-leader BOSCH brushless hub mounted 3kW and 1.2kW motors respectively. The BOSCH 3kW motor easily accelerates up to 70 km/h.The NGT and M+ are electrified by our Panasonic Lithium-ion removable battery packs. The NGT has two removable batteries (2 x 60v35aH), and the M+ has one removable battery (1x 48v42aH). At under 14/11 kg respectively, you can easily carry the battery into your home and charge it in any standard wall outlet, just like your computer.The NGT and M+ have an on-board computer that constantly communicates with the cloud so you can view real-time data on your smart phone like GPS, recent rides, and even anti-theft alerts. We also provide regular Over The Air Updates (OTA) that gets you the most updated software for your scooter.  The NGT comes standard with CBS for safe-braking at high speeds. Both the NGT and M+ come equipped with regenerative EBS braking, which effectively adds around 5% more range on a single charge.Our campaign is a little different than what you are typically accustomed to on Indiegogo, as we will only be taking a €100 deposit today, and the full and final payment will be made at the store you choose to pick-up your scooter at in January when we make delivery.During our 30-day campaign here on Indiegogo you can make a €100 deposit for the NGT, NPro, or the M+.  This €100 deposit will get you a discount off the 2019 retail price.

mantenere il pianale di carico davanti al guidatore e garantire al
contempo la stabilità, propongono un pianale molto basso. La bici
però diventa lunga quasi due metri e mezzo! Non certo agile e

<p>La bici con il carro posteriore allungato ed il pianale di carico
posteriore sopra la ruota non è una nostra invenzione.  Aziende
americane e tedesche le commercializzano già da qualche anno. Ma

essendoci limiti legati alla visibilità e alle dimensioni del
telaio, essa non presenta vincoli volumetrici al carico, rivelandosi
quindi molto adatta al trasporto di qualsiasi genere di merce.

At Ciclostile Trento Bike kitchen we regularly debate; mirror mirror on the wall, what is the fairest cargo bike in the land of all? Why this is an issue is easy to understand. Cargo bikes are beautiful in their own way, they can substitute for trucks in urban traffic and, nowadays, cargo bikes are fashionable!  However, buying a cargo bike is not an easy purchase, it requires a lot of research into the current market, and a basic cargo bike would cost 1500 euros at least.<div>There is a <a href=""http://cyclelogistics.eu/docs/111/D6_9_FPR_Cyclelogistics_print_single_pages_final.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">European project</a> called the Cyclologistic baseline study that has done an in depth comparison  before us making more or less the same considerations (pages 50-55).

Alla ciclofficina Ciclostile a Trento non si parla d'altro: qual è la migliore cargo-bike del reame? E' facile da capire perché ci si ponga il quesito: sono biciclette belle a modo loro, potrebbero essere il vero sostituto del furgone in città, sarebbero utili a quelli dei gruppi d'acquisto solidale  e tra i ""ciclofficinari"" è molto in voga il ""cargo-biker!"". Ma se ne compri una senza ragionarci e senza averle confrontarle tutte... beh non hai l'approccio tipico della ciclofficina. Anche perché non si tratta un acquisto poco impegnativo: una cargo bike economica costa minimo 1500 euro. Un progetto europeo ci aveva anticipato nel confronto (pgg 50 e ss).
Così è cominciata l'avventura: tra una chiacchiera e l'altra, ore di studi e di confronti; poi l'illuminazione! Nessuna di quelle in commercio è davvero adatta al trasporto merce in città. Ne abbiamo disegnata una, diversa dal solito, col piano di carico posteriore e 
l'approccio sportivo; abbiamo contattato artigiani e produttori della zona pronti ad aiutarci con un unico obbiettivo: una cargo bike innovativa ed italiana! Il progetto ora c'è, ma abbiamo bisogno del sostegno di tutti per trasformarlo in realtà. Aiutaci a realizzare il nostro progetto, sostienici e aiutaci a collaudarla.
Le cargo bike hanno una lunga storia. Ma è nella città moderna che trovano il loro ambiente naturale. Oggi sono perfetti mezzi per il trasporto merci urbano e per la logistica di ultimo miglio. La miglior soluzione per il decongestionamento del traffico e per il miglioramento della qualità dell’aria e della vita in generale. Non solo. Come dimostra lo studio di Cyclelogistics il trasporto merci su cargo-bike è  sicuramente più economico del classico fatto
col comune furgoncino diesel. L'Unione Europea punta a ridurre i trasporti su mezzi motorizzati di oltre il 50% sfruttando proprio le cargo bike
(http://cyclelogistics.eu/index.php?id=12)
. Al momento però le cargo bike non sono abbastanza diffuse. 
Lo studio di Cyclologistic è esplicito: ad oggi la cargo perfetta, maneggevole e adatta al carico pesante ancora non è stata disegnata. Abbiamo provato a studiare le caratteristiche delle bici
attualmente in commercio per capire se una struttura diversa potesse
incrementarne l’efficienza e quindi la diffusione. 
La maggior parte delle bici da carico in commercio derivano da
quelle nord-europee, progettate per muoversi con calma su strade
pianeggianti e garantire al guidatore di avere sott'occhio il carico
anche a discapito della guidabilità del mezzo. Molte aziende, per
mantenere il pianale di carico davanti al guidatore e garantire al
contempo la stabilità, propongono un pianale molto basso. La bici
però diventa lunga quasi due metri e mezzo! Non certo agile e
maneggevole nel traffico!
Altre cargo bike sono le dirette pronipoti delle storiche bici da lavoro a tre ruote degli anni '20. Dotate di un ampio pianale
poggiato su due ruote all'anteriore sono imbattibili nella capacità
di carico. Ma assolutamente lente e inutilizzabili nel traffico
cittadino di oggi!Diversamente dalla percezione diffusa, il mercato delle cargo bike
oggi è principalmente rivolto all’uso familiare e al trasporto dei
bambini, per cui l’acquirente medio ha una forte preferenza per la
visibilità del carico. 
Volendo invece pensare a un mezzo agevole nel traffico cittadino e
nelle zone collinari che sia davvero competitivo rispetto ai
furgoncini nella logistica last mile e, quindi, di reale interesse
economico, abbiamo provato a immaginare la struttura della cargo bike
in modo che il pianale di carico si trovi nella zona posteriore della
bicicletta, sufficientemente in basso, che regali al mezzo una certa
compattezza. 

La bici con il carro posteriore allungato ed il pianale di carico
posteriore sopra la ruota non è una nostra invenzione.  Aziende
americane e tedesche le commercializzano già da qualche anno. Ma
sono progettate molto spesso con geometrie rilassate. A guidarle la percezione è quella di una bici classica, comoda, ma non certo agile e veloce.
Il carico posteriore presenta un ulteriore vantaggio: non
essendoci limiti legati alla visibilità e alle dimensioni del
telaio, essa non presenta vincoli volumetrici al carico, rivelandosi
quindi molto adatta al trasporto di qualsiasi genere di merce.
Insomma, una bici manegevole, veloce, economica e in grado di portare
in modo sicuro, ecologico e flessibile carichi fino a 150 kg! 
La nostra cargo recupera le geometrie ed i comportamenti delle
bici sportive. Non solo.  Dalle bici sportive vorremmo ereditasse
anche le tubazioni. Abbiamo spezzato le linee e rimpicciolito i
triangoli per poter usare tubazioni in leghe leggere per bici da
corsa. Risultato in due parole: leggera ed agile. Ma ciò non vuol
dire che sarà necessariamente scomoda: ogni esemplare sarà
realizzato artigianalmente, perciò potrà essere realizzato su
misura. 
 Abbiamo sfruttato i nostri amici: pomeriggi a discutere con
chi la cargo la utilizza tutti i giorni come bike messenger e con chi
trasporta casse di frutta e verdura per i mercatini a km0. Ore e ore
di bozzetti su carta prima e sui CAD poi. Ampi di battiti con
telaisti. Lunghe in officina a discutere, scegliere, provare.Ora siamo arrivati ad un progetto abbastanza definito e siamo
ad un passo dal realizzarlo! 
Le idee ce le abbiamo, ma abbiamo bisogno del sostegno di tutti
per trasformarle in realtà. Il tuo contributo può andare oltre il
mero finanziamento: 
Per realizzare la miglior cargobike abbiamo in mente un percorso
innovativo in più fasi che necessita di un sostegno collettivo dal
basso. Per partire ci servono per lo meno 2500 euro. E' questo
infatti il costo effettivo che abbiamo preventivato per realizzare il
primo prototipo. Se questa soglia non verrà raggiunta le vostre donazioni vi verranno restituite. Ma ciò vorrà dire che il vostro sforzo per sostenerci è stato vano. Non basta quindi un sostegno economico! Oltre a donare spargi la voce! dillo a tutti i tuoi amici! sostieni la mobilità alternativa!
Il telaio sarà realizzato per noi un artigiano della nostra zona
e cercheremo di utilizzare componentistica (sella, manubrio,cerchi,...) per lo più di produzione italiana. Una scelta etica ed ecologica con un occhio all'economicità, alla funzionalità senza rinunciare alla qualità! 
Una volta realizzato il primo prototipo comincerà la fase dei
collaudi diffusi. Chiunque potrà diventare nostro collaudatore!
Raccoglieremo le opinioni, le confronteremo e solo allora potremmo
rivedere il nostro progetto che, grazie all'aiuto di tanti, sarà
migliorato fino a diventare la cargo bike perfetta!
Ma speriamo di andare oltre: 

Se raccogliamo almeno 4500 euro realizzeremo anche
il secondo prototipo: questo nascerà già modificato secondo le
indicazioni raccolte nella prima fase di test. 
Se raccogliamo almeno 7000 euro realizzeremo tre
prototipi e soprattutto, dopo la fase di test impronteremo in modo
strutturale la rete di contatti che ci dovrebbe permettere di
commercializzare in breve la nostra cargo bike collaudata ad un costo
accessibile e concorrenziale mantenendo la produzione del telaio in
Italia e l'assemblaggio di ruote e biciclette fatto direttamente da
noi.
Le belle idee nascono solo nei gruppi più belli. Diverse ragazzi,
diverse esperienze, diverse formazioni, tante passioni una in comune:
la bicicletta! Ci siamo incontrati nella Ciclofficina Ciclostile di
Trento e lì ci siamo confrontati tra la riparazione di una bici e un
bicchiere in compagnia. Adesso dopo mesi di ragionamenti, bozzetti ed
esperimenti casalinghi abbiamo deciso che il progetto è maturo per
vedere la luce. Aiutaci anche tu!

At Ciclostile Trento Bike kitchen we regularly debate; mirror mirror on the wall, what is the fairest cargo bike in the land of all? Why this is an issue is easy to understand. Cargo bikes are beautiful in their own way, they can substitute for trucks in urban traffic and, nowadays, cargo bikes are fashionable!  However, buying a cargo bike is not an easy purchase, it requires a lot of research into the current market, and a basic cargo bike would cost 1500 euros at least.There is a European project called the Cyclologistic baseline study that has done an in depth comparison  before us making more or less the same considerations (pages 50-55). Some of its main points we use here to illustrate the value of cargo bikes.

The Trento bike kitchen approach, and the way we began: chatting, studying and comparing; then came the enlightenment! The perfect cargo bike for the urban freight transport is still yet to be designed! 


So we have designed one. A long-tail bike with a sportive soul. We asked artisans and producers of small bike components from our region to help us and everyone is ready just to reach one target: building a new cargo bike, innovative and Italian! The project is done! Now we need everyone's help to turn it into reality. Help us to make our project a reality, sustain us and help us to test it!


Cargo bikes have a long history, though, the modern city are their natural environment. Nowadays, they represent the perfect solution for urban mobility and  modern freight transport logistics contributing directly to reduce congestion and pollution in today's cities.The Cyclologistic baseline study determined that on average 51% of all motorized trips in European cities that involve the transport of goods could be shifted to bicycles or cargo bikes.
The study also shows that most goods' transport within cities is done by commercial lorries and states that it would be more efficient and cheaper if done by cargo bikes.However, cargo bike usage is currently not widespread enough.The Cyclologistic baseline study is explicit: “The perfect cargo bike and trike capable of handling heavy loads in continual use is still to be designed” We have  studied characteristics of bikes currently commercialized in order to understand how to improve their efficiency.Nowadays, most of the cargo bikes hail from a Northern European design, suitable for riding slow along flat land, with front loading to keep an eye on your cargo. In order to have a stable bike and the cargo on the front, many companies produce cargo bikes with  a low loading bed. The downside is the length of the bike: about 2 meters and half, difficult to maneuver in traffic and not very agile!Other cargo bikes are the direct descendants of the historical trikes of the early '20s. The bed is squared, big and robust supported on the two front wheels. Unbeatable in loading capacity, but slow moving and too large and clumsy for today's traffic congestion.Despite what is the common perception, the cargo bike market is oriented mainly to family use and the transportation of children and pets. Therefore, average consumer have a strong preference for the visibility of the cargo.We wanted to create a bike agile in heavy traffic, really competitive compared to small commercial trucks  and, therefore, really economically appealing. Therefore, we have endeavoured to design a cargo bike with the loading bed behind the rider,  low enough to give the bike a compact and agile ability while maintaining a desirable loading capacity.

Some German and American companies have been producing them since the early '90s; they are called long tail bike. They are designed with relaxed geometry. Riding one of them you feel as if you are riding a classical cruiser bike comfortable which is easy to ride but not agile and fast. The rear loading bed has many other advantages; there is no limit linked to visibility or to the frame shape, therefore there is no volumetric constraints. The bike is suitable for any kind of bulk transportation. Handling, agility, safety, economic and sustainable transport which loads up to 150kgs; that is, in short are our cargo bike's highlights.   Our cargo bikes geometry and behaviour is inspired  from road bikes. We wanted our bike to inherit tubing from road bikes, so we broke the design lines and dwarfed the triangles. What we expect in two words: light and fast. The bike will be comfortable, the frame handmade, and customized to each body type. We opportunise on our active friends: afternoons passed discussing the use of a  cargo bike on a daily basis either as a bike messenger, or while carrying fruit crates to the farmer markets. Hours passed drawing sketches on paper and perfecting with CAD software. Long discussions with framebuilders, many hours spent in our bike kitchen chatting, choosing, trying. 

Now we have got a pretty well-defined project and we are very close to our target.We have the ideas, but we need everyone's help to bring them into reality! Your contribution can go even further than the pure founding. To realize the best cargo bike we developed a new way of designing divided in steps that need collective help. To start, we need at least 2500 Euros. This is the effective cost of  producing the first prototype and running the first test. The frame is going to be handmade for us by an Italian frame builder and we are going to use components (saddle, handlebar, wheels...) mostly made in Italy. An ethical and sustainable choice, that takes into consideration the economical and functional side without sacrificing world-famous Italian quality!  Once we have the first prototype, the collective tests step will begin. Anyone can become our tester! We will collect all opinions, compare them and only then we will be able to review the project. Just with the help of many of you, the first prototype will be improved since it will become the perfect cargo bike.   Even the name of the cargo bike model will be chosen collectively. We need your help to choose it.   But we want to go above and beyond this initial goal.
If we collect 4500 Euros, we will build a second prototype. This will be re-designed according to the first guideline that comes out from the 
first tests. 
If we collect 7000 Euros, we will build three prototypes. Above all, after the tests are done, we will generate a network of of producers that will enable us to produce and commercialize  our tested cargo bike in a short period of time  and sell it for an affordable price, keeping the frame production in Italy and the in-house production line.
Good Ideas can grow only in cooperative groups. Many people, many experiences, many sources, many passions, one love in common: bikes! We met each other in CiclOstile Trento Bike Kitchen fixing bikes,  chatting, having a drink together we start to talk about cargos; after months of chatting, sketches and homemade experiments, we decided that the project is now ready to become a real bike. 
Help us to make it real!

27 Seconds On How PolitePersistence Will Make Your Life Better

60 Seconds on How PolitePersistence Works

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“If you’re going to send one email, you may as well send three or four.”
 – Donald Asher, Career Guru





My name is John.  I’m an ordinary guy who has ordinary likes and dislikes.  I like people who are polite.  I like people who are persistent.  I dislike having to spend time on meaningless work.  
You get the picture.  
My wife, friends and I created PolitePersistence in response to these likes and dislikes. 
We like connecting with others and do so frequently by email.  But, we dislike having to spend time tracking our email output to potential business partners or cool people we want to get to know.  We also have minor panic attacks when we forget to send a timely follow up email when we haven’t received a reply to our increasingly desperate attempts at human interaction.  We’re seeking help.
Until we evolve more as humans, PolitePersistence is how we save time.  Here's how it works:


0. Connect PolitePersistence with a Gmail email account. (See below in the FAQ for how you can use PolitePersistence with ANY email account) 
1. I click on the PolitePersistence icon to go into ULTRA TIME SAVING MODE. I then write my initial introduction email to my childhood hero, now turned self-help book author, and cooking show judge by clicking on the first tab.    Cue trumpets!
2. From the same compose screen as my introduction email, I write out my follow up emails that will zip out automatically at scheduled intervals should my initial email get lost in the deluge of fan mail, business mail, or pool of human distraction that drowns all introduction emails.  I’m not bitter.  
3. I set the date and time for each email and click initiate.  
4. That’s it. 

If the person replies to my initial email ahead of my scheduled follow up, PolitePersistence stops being persistent, and politely cancels the email follow up.  How? We wrote politeness into the code.  This is what the process looks like visually:

 
Step 1. Turn on PolitePersistence in Gmail.



Step 2. Compose all ofyour emails fro m introduction through to follow up.





Step 3. Schedule your follow up emails and click initiate.


Step 4. Move on, panic free. Yay! Yippee! Three cheers for regular heartbeats! Just me?

<h1><b>How It Became:</b></h1>
<p><b>My parents used to have a manure

dead flies. It was gross!</b></p>

<b><br/></b><p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>After walking into one and getting disgusting sticky dead fly glue
 in my hair I came up with the idea to make a sticky fly trap that hides
 the dead flies out of sight. I also wanted it to look good hanging in 
your house!</b></p>
<h1><b>The Design Process:</b></h1>
<p><b>So I went to
 into Staples to look at some patterns and colors I could use to start

(I hold a 1 year patent)
MY FLY TRAP IS A BETTER LOOKING VERSION OF THE TYPICAL FLY RIBBON THAT CATCHES FLIES IN YOUR HOME USING A STICKY FLY ATTRACTANT ONLY MY DESIGN HIDES THE GROSS DEAD FLIES FROM SIGHT!
WHO WANTS A DISGUSTING FLY STRIP FULL OF DEAD FLIES HANGING IN THEIR HOUSE WHEN YOU COULD HAVE MY DESIGNER LOOKING FLY TRAP?
THE PRICES ARE SIMILAR AND ALSO WORKS WELL. IT COMES PACKAGED FLAT AND IS DISPOSABLE. ALSO HAS HOLES FOR THE FLIES TO CRAWL THROUGH TO ACCESS THE STICKY GLUE.
SIMPLY  PEEL AWAY THE PROTECTIVE LAYER TO REVEAL THE STICKY GLUE, FOLD INTO SHAPE ALONG THE  CORRUGATED LINES, ADHERE THE EDGES WITH THE DOUBLE SIDED TAPED EDGE, THEN HANG. TOSS IN THE GARBAGE WHEN IT'S DONE!

A FEW DESIGNS BELOW:

  FLIES TRAPPED INSIDE



How It Became:
My parents used to have a manure 
farm close to their neighborhood which attracted a lot of flies as you 
could imagine and they would always hang these ugly fly strip from 
ceiling fans or light fixtures that were filled with tonnes of nasty 
dead flies. It was gross!

 in my hair I came up with the idea to make a sticky fly trap that hides
 the dead flies out of sight. I also wanted it to look good hanging in 
your house!
The Design Process:
So I went to
 into Staples to look at some patterns and colors I could use to start 
making some prototypes and decided to go with these to start.









I actually first started with a cylindrical shape that I just 
rolled into shape and glued shut after punching holes in it for the 
flies to crawl through.





Then I cam up with the prism shaped one that's more attractive than the cylinder and just as easy to fold into shape from flat. 
The
 prototypes I have made so far that you see in the pictures here have 
your ""typical"" sticky fly strip cut into strips and glued to the 
designer construction paper I chose. I pre-punched the holes for the 
flies to access the sticky fly attractant inside when folded together. 
Then folded it into the prism shape and added double sided tape along 
the seem to join both edges. Ten hung some string and I was done.
I tested a few sizes and found this looked the best and offered the same sticky glue surface area as fly ribbon. 





It can also sit flat like this on a window sill if you prefer that to hanging it.





So I made up a dozen and shipped them out to a friend in India

The main idea of Raven scooter was to try changing an elementary behavior of an item as such and to attempt making it more classy, more subtle and more user-friendly, and handy to use. Therefore the Raven kick scooter folds with a single movement of a foot. Its users just need to press the pedal with a foot and that is that. So it is absolutely comfortable to use. Since we wanted to expand our target group and to create a trend which would involve businessmen to be a part of this eco-friendly vehicle movement, we have chosen carbon fiber material for its luxuriance, stability and lightness. Moreover, we designed an orange gap in the middle of horizontal frame to enable folding of the whole scooter to an absolute flat-pack stick which does not take much space. The streamlined shape of the Raven perfectly fits the user’s shoulder therefore it is possible to carry it easily when the scooter is folded. Finally, our main ambition is to change an approach of the people throughout the world towards the things that seem unchangeable and to replace rushing with a pleasant and useful process.

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p>In just two years, Ride the Rideau has raised an incredible $2.7M for cancer research at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (OHRI). This funding has helped us build the new Centre for Innovative Cancer Research, a unique, world-class laboratory that is enabling our researchers to rapidly move their discoveries into the clinic to benefit patients. Ride the Rideau has also helped our researchers develop and test promising new therapies, such as cancer-fighting viruses that target tumours without harming normal tissues. Support for clinical trials has also increased, ensuring that patients in Ottawa will continue to have access to the newest cancer treatments. You can be sure, however, that the benefits of this research are felt not only in Ottawa, but also around the world.</p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Anything and everything helps. If you are unable to contribute financially, Ride the Rideau is looking for volunteers. I would also greatly appreciate it if you could share this on Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and the like!</p>

**taken from http://www.ridetherideau.ca/raising-funds-for-o...
In just two years, Ride the Rideau has raised an incredible $2.7M for cancer research at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (OHRI). This funding has helped us build the new Centre for Innovative Cancer Research, a unique, world-class laboratory that is enabling our researchers to rapidly move their discoveries into the clinic to benefit patients. Ride the Rideau has also helped our researchers develop and test promising new therapies, such as cancer-fighting viruses that target tumours without harming normal tissues. Support for clinical trials has also increased, ensuring that patients in Ottawa will continue to have access to the newest cancer treatments. You can be sure, however, that the benefits of this research are felt not only in Ottawa, but also around the world.


Other Ways You Can Help
Anything and everything helps. If you are unable to contribute financially, Ride the Rideau is looking for volunteers. I would also greatly appreciate it if you could share this on Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and the like!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Car Emotion</strong> is the only system on the market, which is able to detect signs of life inside a vehicle. This game changer development has clearly proven its ability to send a warning via text message, 60 seconds after the driver exits the vehicle, in any situation where a child is left behind. In such a situation, the driver is very likely to still be near the vehicle.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise $240,000, in order to advance from the prototype stage to industrial production. The investment will enable us to develop the engineering features of the device, which serves as the “heart of the system” in the vehicle, establish interfaces to the sensor systems, develop electronic circuits, develop software systems and reduce the size of the product to the size of a smartphone. It will be designed and adapted so that it can be installed conveniently and integrated into any private vehicle, and, in the future, be incorporated into every vehicle that leaves the production line.</li>
<li>We are determined to manufacture the product, even if we do not succeed in raising the required amount through the Indigogo crowdfunding platform. Unfortunately, in that case, development and production will take longer<span dir=""RTL"">.</span>
</li>
<li>For 100$ you get a perfect Car Emotion Unit with warranty &amp; service for 1 year!</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><strong>The campaign is designed to enable the Company, within a period of about six months, to advance from the present prototype stage and to start mass production. We invite you to invest in the system, at cost price, so that your donation will save children's lives, worldwide<span dir=""RTL"">.</span></strong></li></ul>
</div><div><ul></ul></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Through crowdfunding, we want to change the “rules of the game,” according to which every case of forgetting a child in a vehicle on a hot day could end tragically. We currently have a solution that does not exist anywhere else in the world: the ability to identify “‘signs of life” in a vehicle. Installation of the system is a life-saver that could prevent irreversible harm to children, incapacitated people or animals, all over the world. Anyone who has forgotten a child for even a few moments knows that even once is sometimes too often. How much are you prepared to give, to prevent you or others suffering this grief?</li>
<li>The system is ready and has passed all the tests. We have a prototype. The Chief Scientist of the State of Israel has been convinced and is making a significant contribution to the project. Dr. Gadi Shvetz and Dr. Boris Greenstein have, in the past, successfully developed systems for locating life underground. Car-Emotion's system provides a conclusive indication in 100% of cases.</li>
<li>So now, between us and the ability to save lives all over the world, stands the sum of $240,000. If a thousand people all over the world believe in the system and donate $100 each – we will reach our goal!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Three years ago, we embarked on a global mission involving two disciplines: on the one hand, a basic solution, without buttons, to alert us to any mistake that could lead to disaster. On the other hand – the world of mathematics and algorithms. On the way, we managed to combine the two, and today we have a winning product. At first we invested a lot of time, then we invested hundreds of hours of work and in the advanced stages we invested money.</li>
<li>Our team combined decades of learning in CIS countries, experience gained in one of the best armies in the world, and energy that is full of love for people, for parents and for children. We believe in our venture and we hope you will join us and support us. The Sanhedrin, the Supreme Religious Court that operated in the Land of Israel 1500 years ago, ruled that “every person created in the world is single and unique, and therefore anyone who saves a life, it is considered as if he saved an entire world.”</li>
<li>As far as we are concerned, even if we do not succeed in reaching the funding goal through Indigogo, we will continue with the belief that we will be able to save lives<span dir=""RTL"">.</span>

THE REVOLUTIONARY SELF-CHARGING FOLDING E-BIKE

 
    We believe that an electric folding bike gives you unlimited freedom in cities. Take it everywhere, make it part of you!The VELLO BIKE is a high-performance folding bike that has been developed for the perfect urban cycling experience. Built for people with a fast-paced lifestyle who don’t want to be slowed down by the restrictions of a conventional bicycle.We have put a lot of thought into developing a folding bike without any compromise to its riding performance: top-quality components combined with new technologies, an exclusive and award-winning design and various specially developed innovations guarantee a comfortable ride in the city. Thanks to its small fold, it can be transported easily onto public transport systems and placed under a desk or in a suitcase for travel.  A high-performance folding bike that provides a great riding experience Wheel it around Put it under your office desk  Put one or more VELLO BIKES in the trunk  Just fold it in a few seconds to fit into a standard Samsonite suitcase for travel. There is no need to disassemble the bike, just fold it. Visibility is very important to us: all our bikes have integrated LED lights in the front and rear clamp. All our bikes have the necessary reflectors on pedals and wheels. We also supply front and rear reflectors, and there are a number of VELLO accessories available for purchase in our online shop.
A variety of accessories - integrated lights, mudguards, front and rear carriers, kickstand and much more!Carbon Drive Belt and Hydraulic Disk Brakes optionsHands-free and safe-locking magnetic folding!Thanks to a self-locking magnet-release system, it folds quickly and easily and can be wheeled around or made to fit seamlessly into small spaces.The breakthrough technology allows the battery to recharge on the energy generated while cycling, so you don’t need to dismantle it at the end of your ride and you will not run out of battery power. E-bike technology has been changing fast, and you’ll still find a lot of blogs dated from only a couple of years ago saying that you can only extend the range through regenerative braking for up to 10 percent and that generally self-charging e-bike technology is not possible. We are changing this with the VELLO BIKE+ as it allows up to 100% recharging while riding the bike. The energy with this new system is harvested as before by braking and pedaling, just that it now also converts mechanical energy into electrical energy thanks to the Integrated Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS). In that way, additional energy is released to recharge the light integrated lithium-ion battery. Through this new technology, VELLO BIKE+ all-in-one changes the motor map automatically and continuously in order to keep the battery charged. The motor assistance and the cutoff speed both depend on the battery charge, the input from the pedals (speed-torque) and the road slope.Choose from different assistance levels to get the extra push you need with the 250W motor. It is electrically-assisted when you want it to be. Unlike most electric bikes, it is still easy to pedal even with the power assistance turned off.You can ride up to 15 miles per hour (25 km/hour) for unlimited mileage in ""self-charging mode"", or in ""turbo mode"" for approx. 30 miles (50 km) on a full charge without any effort. As soon as you stop pedaling, the motor will stop pushing. The generated power depends on several factors including the bike speed, the pedaling speed, the road slope and the selected power mode. Plug in the charger after you use the bike in ""turbo mode"" only.The charger is for free and always comes complementary together with your bike. The full charging time is 3 hours. By connecting your VELLO bike+ to your smart phone through Bluetooth, you can easily set the appropriate mode for the pedal assistance as well as plan bicycle routes.  CONNECT it to:
Lock the rear wheel making it very difficult to pedal and harder to steal (available when the batter charge is greater than 20%)

There’s just nothing quite like them and there’s nothing quite like ours. </p><p>Thanks to a successful Kickstarter campaign we have already paid for the moulds of the Rough Stuff wheels and battery case. We are still looking to reach £50k in order that we can meet minimum order  quantities to allow us to offer different coloured wheels. We have a great relationship with our manufacturers in China as well as feet on the ground over there. Our internal PCB’s, wireless control and technical aspects have all been tested extensively, not only by our team but you guys, our awesome customers in our current range of eboards. </p><p>We have feedback from all of our customers which have led us to this design. Skaters, long boarders and eboarder's have all chipped in to create exactly what the eboard market is missing.</p><p>The new elements of the new design are aesthetic and practical and so it’s essentially a re-design of a proven model. Many crowdfunding projects (particulary some US eboard ones) do succeed and reach their target but very often do not come to fruition as those running the campaign have very little manufacturing knowledge. So many projects fall down at this last hurdle with no prior knowledge of where to go at this point.</p><h3>Why the Flex-Eboard is different</h3><p>Lots of eboard manufacturers are moving towards integrated battery decks which is fine, but that's where the Flex-Eboard is different. An integrated battery means you lose the flexibility of the deck, plus you are stuck with one deck design. </p><p>Plus we have chosen not to move to Hub motors for a few reasons.</p><ul>
<li>They have poor torque whereas the Flex-Eboard is geared up in a 3:1 ratio.</li>
<li>They have a tiny thickness of PU wheel on the outside of the hub motor. This reduces the ride to a bone shaking experience on anything but a perfect surface.</li>
<li>Our customers can upgrade motors in the future when more powerful ones become available. No need for a whole new expensive hub motor. </li>
</ul><p>Our innovative battery case is flexible and 'bolt-on' style meaning you have a flexible more grounded ride and you aren't tied to a single design. It's really easy to swap the deck in the future and means that customisation is endless.</p><p>We've also developed Rough Stuff polyurethane wheels which are far more suitable for UK and European roads. We're not calling them 'Off-Road' wheels as our aim was to give a more comfortable ride on Multi-Terrain. Which for most people is poor quality tarmac and light gravel paths. We also wanted to offer the choice, so designed our wheels to fit a standard 35mm bearing and 6 prong sprocket so it can fit ABEC 11 Flywheels and many other brands too. </p><p>To date we have sold over 500 electric longboards and have our electronics perfected. So no teething problems or connection issues to worry about with our new design. We have it tested, re-tested and tested it again. Not on a bench in a workshop but by all of our current customers riding all over the world.</p><h3>Why we need your help </h3><p>In all manufacturing, there are discounts for larger quantities. With guaranteed orders at these quantities, we’ll be able to keep the price low and create supply chains to allow us to get the Flex-Eboard to customers around the world. We have finalised the Flex-Eboard design, formed partnerships and have a solid production plan in place. To ramp up production we need your help to pay for expensive moulds in order to produce on a mass scale. Then we can increase production and bring the costs down. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Thank you for all your support. We’re looking forward to seeing Flex-Eboard being ridden all around the world.</strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499179294/bp7wua5quwvpipyouak3.png"" src=""""/></strong></p><p> </p><h2>SAFETY</h2><p>The Flex-Eboard is an electric skateboard. You should learn at slow speeds in Fun mode before moving to Thrill Mode. Always wear a helmet and personal protective gear in case anything happens. Ride within your limits and read our full instruction manual before using the Flex-Eboard. </p><h2>LEGALITY</h2><p>Laws and regulations regarding electric vehicles, and electric skateboards, vary by country, state, county, and municipality, so please check the local legal status of this product before you ride it.</p><h2>FAQ's</h2><p><strong>Q: I am not living in the UK, can I buy a Flex-Eboard?</strong></p><p>A: We ship to the UK, EU Countries and the US. Check each pledge for the total shipping costs. </p><p><strong>Q: Can I use normal road style wheels on the Flex-Eboard?</strong></p><p>A: Yep, it's compatible with both flat road and our Rough Stuff Wheels. The sprockets mounts on to 35mm bearings and can fit on ABEC 11 Flywheels.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I mount the Rough Stuff Wheels on another eboard or board?</strong></p><p>A: Absolutely. Each set of Rough Stuff wheels comes with a 2 drive sprockets to mount on a standard 35mm bearing, as well as 2 belt drive covers.</p><p><strong>Q: Does my Flex-Eboard come with a warranty?</strong></p><p>A: Each Flex-Eboard comes with a 12 month warranty against manufacturers defects. For full warranty information check out our Warranty section at <a href=""http://www.slickrevolution.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.slickrevolution.co.uk</a></p><p><strong>Q: Is the Flex-Eboard waterproof?</strong></p><p>A: It's water resistant which means that you can ride on wet ground, however if water is splashing up then thats too wet. 5 minutes of drizzle to get home will be ok too. It is electrical at the end of the day so just be careful near water. </p><p><strong>Q: What could I do if my Flex-E runs out of battery?</strong></p><p>A: Just like a normal longboard or skateboard you can ride without power. There is some slight resistance from the motors but it isn't too much at all.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I bring the Flex-Eboard on aeroplanes or check-in?</strong></p><p>A: Since the recent issues with Hoverboards and Samsung Galaxy Note 7's most airlines are very cautious and as a general rule most will not allow batteries above 100Wh. The Flex-Eboard's batteries are 194Wh. </p><p><strong>Q: What is the return policy ?</strong></p><p>A: Don't worry! We have 14-Day Satisfaction Guaranteed.  We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchases. Orders are fully refundable at any time prior to shipping. If you’re not happy with the product within 14 days, simply return it back to us for a full refund. * Items returned for refund must be returned unused within 14 days from delivery. </p><p>Under no circumstances will we issue refunds after 14 days of delivery.</p><p>*Customers are responsible for shipping costs for all return claims and are subject to restocking fee of 20% if the eboard has been ridden or are not in store bought condition with packaging in new, sellable form.</p><p><strong>Q: What does the 12 month Warranty cover?</strong></p><p>A: Our twelve month warranty covers all manufacturers defects. If you have a problem with your Flex-eboard due to a manufacturers defect we will arrange pickup for free and repair the eboard as soon as we can within the UK, then send it back out to you. For other countries we will send out spare parts based on a diagnosis of the issue. We also offer a repair service for eboards which are damaged or broken due to user negligence or accidents.</p><p><strong>Q: What is the maximum user weight of the Flex-Eboard?</strong></p><p>A: 120kg or 265lbs is our recommended maximum user weight. </p><p><strong>Q:  I'm closer to the top end of the weight limit, will I get the same performance?</strong></p><p>A: Our performance spec's are based on an 80kg rider on smooth tarmac. If you weight heavier than this you won't achieve the same ranges or quite touch the top speed however with the torque of the 2 x 1200W motors riders up to 120kg won't be far off. </p><p><strong>Q: Where are the Flex-Eboards shipping from?</strong></p><p>A: The Flex-Eboard is manufactured in China after which they will be shipped to the UK. After further quality control checks by our team they will then be shipped to you, our awesome backers! Once they arrive in the UK shipping to the US and Europe will take around 2 weeks. </p><p><strong>Q: Once I have backed the Flex-Eboard, what happens then?</strong></p><p>A: We will keep you updated about production, manufacturing, shipping and all the important things that you want to know, right here on this page.</p><p><strong>Q: Ive pledged on Indiegogo, now what happens?</strong></p><p>A: We will be in touch to arrange shipping once the Flex-Eboard and Rough Stuff Wheels are ready.</p><p><strong>Q: What if theres a delay in production?</strong></p><p>A: We have built buffer periods into our predicted shipping time to allow for a delay at any stage from manufacture of the moulds to shipping. If however there is a delay we will notify you immediately and keep you well up to date on any change in the timescale.</p><p>-------------</p><h3>Risks and challenges</h3><p>Slick Revolution is prepared to begin production of the Flex-Eboard at the conclusion of this campaign, however, with the release of any product, there may be unforeseen obstacles that could prevent us from getting certain elements of the product just right. As we strive to provide you with the ultimate user experience and would not feel comfortable releasing any product until it is perfect, there is always the possibility of delays.</p><p>We promise to do our best to keep you as up to date as possible on any and all Flex-Eboard related developments and are working to reduce as many issues as possible before the Flex-Eboard and Rough Stuff Wheels official release.</p></div>","So what sets us apart from the rest?

There’s just nothing quite like them and there’s nothing quite like ours. Thanks to a successful Kickstarter campaign we have already paid for the moulds of the Rough Stuff wheels and battery case. We are still looking to reach £50k in order that we can meet minimum order  quantities to allow us to offer different coloured wheels. We have a great relationship with our manufacturers in China as well as feet on the ground over there. Our internal PCB’s, wireless control and technical aspects have all been tested extensively, not only by our team but you guys, our awesome customers in our current range of eboards. We have feedback from all of our customers which have led us to this design. Skaters, long boarders and eboarder's have all chipped in to create exactly what the eboard market is missing.The new elements of the new design are aesthetic and practical and so it’s essentially a re-design of a proven model. Many crowdfunding projects (particulary some US eboard ones) do succeed and reach their target but very often do not come to fruition as those running the campaign have very little manufacturing knowledge. So many projects fall down at this last hurdle with no prior knowledge of where to go at this point.Why the Flex-Eboard is differentLots of eboard manufacturers are moving towards integrated battery decks which is fine, but that's where the Flex-Eboard is different. An integrated battery means you lose the flexibility of the deck, plus you are stuck with one deck design. Plus we have chosen not to move to Hub motors for a few reasons.
They have poor torque whereas the Flex-Eboard is geared up in a 3:1 ratio.
They have a tiny thickness of PU wheel on the outside of the hub motor. This reduces the ride to a bone shaking experience on anything but a perfect surface.
Our customers can upgrade motors in the future when more powerful ones become available. No need for a whole new expensive hub motor. 
Our innovative battery case is flexible and 'bolt-on' style meaning you have a flexible more grounded ride and you aren't tied to a single design. It's really easy to swap the deck in the future and means that customisation is endless.We've also developed Rough Stuff polyurethane wheels which are far more suitable for UK and European roads. We're not calling them 'Off-Road' wheels as our aim was to give a more comfortable ride on Multi-Terrain. Which for most people is poor quality tarmac and light gravel paths. We also wanted to offer the choice, so designed our wheels to fit a standard 35mm bearing and 6 prong sprocket so it can fit ABEC 11 Flywheels and many other brands too. To date we have sold over 500 electric longboards and have our electronics perfected. So no teething problems or connection issues to worry about with our new design. We have it tested, re-tested and tested it again. Not on a bench in a workshop but by all of our current customers riding all over the world.Why we need your help In all manufacturing, there are discounts for larger quantities. With guaranteed orders at these quantities, we’ll be able to keep the price low and create supply chains to allow us to get the Flex-Eboard to customers around the world. We have finalised the Flex-Eboard design, formed partnerships and have a solid production plan in place. To ramp up production we need your help to pay for expensive moulds in order to produce on a mass scale. Then we can increase production and bring the costs down. Thank you for all your support. We’re looking forward to seeing Flex-Eboard being ridden all around the world. SAFETYThe Flex-Eboard is an electric skateboard. You should learn at slow speeds in Fun mode before moving to Thrill Mode. Always wear a helmet and personal protective gear in case anything happens. Ride within your limits and read our full instruction manual before using the Flex-Eboard. LEGALITYLaws and regulations regarding electric vehicles, and electric skateboards, vary by country, state, county, and municipality, so please check the local legal status of this product before you ride it.FAQ'sQ: I am not living in the UK, can I buy a Flex-Eboard?A: We ship to the UK, EU Countries and the US. Check each pledge for the total shipping costs. Q: Can I use normal road style wheels on the Flex-Eboard?A: Yep, it's compatible with both flat road and our Rough Stuff Wheels. The sprockets mounts on to 35mm bearings and can fit on ABEC 11 Flywheels.Q: Can I mount the Rough Stuff Wheels on another eboard or board?A: Absolutely. Each set of Rough Stuff wheels comes with a 2 drive sprockets to mount on a standard 35mm bearing, as well as 2 belt drive covers.Q: Does my Flex-Eboard come with a warranty?A: Each Flex-Eboard comes with a 12 month warranty against manufacturers defects. For full warranty information check out our Warranty section at www.slickrevolution.co.ukQ: Is the Flex-Eboard waterproof?A: It's water resistant which means that you can ride on wet ground, however if water is splashing up then thats too wet. 5 minutes of drizzle to get home will be ok too. It is electrical at the end of the day so just be careful near water. Q: What could I do if my Flex-E runs out of battery?A: Just like a normal longboard or skateboard you can ride without power. There is some slight resistance from the motors but it isn't too much at all.Q: Can I bring the Flex-Eboard on aeroplanes or check-in?A: Since the recent issues with Hoverboards and Samsung Galaxy Note 7's most airlines are very cautious and as a general rule most will not allow batteries above 100Wh. The Flex-Eboard's batteries are 194Wh. Q: What is the return policy ?A: Don't worry! We have 14-Day Satisfaction Guaranteed.  We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchases. Orders are fully refundable at any time prior to shipping. If you’re not happy with the product within 14 days, simply return it back to us for a full refund. * Items returned for refund must be returned unused within 14 days from delivery. Under no circumstances will we issue refunds after 14 days of delivery.*Customers are responsible for shipping costs for all return claims and are subject to restocking fee of 20% if the eboard has been ridden or are not in store bought condition with packaging in new, sellable form.Q: What does the 12 month Warranty cover?A: Our twelve month warranty covers all manufacturers defects. If you have a problem with your Flex-eboard due to a manufacturers defect we will arrange pickup for free and repair the eboard as soon as we can within the UK, then send it back out to you. For other countries we will send out spare parts based on a diagnosis of the issue. We also offer a repair service for eboards which are damaged or broken due to user negligence or accidents.Q: What is the maximum user weight of the Flex-Eboard?A: 120kg or 265lbs is our recommended maximum user weight. Q:  I'm closer to the top end of the weight limit, will I get the same performance?A: Our performance spec's are based on an 80kg rider on smooth tarmac. If you weight heavier than this you won't achieve the same ranges or quite touch the top speed however with the torque of the 2 x 1200W motors riders up to 120kg won't be far off. Q: Where are the Flex-Eboards shipping from?A: The Flex-Eboard is manufactured in China after which they will be shipped to the UK. After further quality control checks by our team they will then be shipped to you, our awesome backers! Once they arrive in the UK shipping to the US and Europe will take around 2 weeks. Q: Once I have backed the Flex-Eboard, what happens then?A: We will keep you updated about production, manufacturing, shipping and all the important things that you want to know, right here on this page.Q: Ive pledged on Indiegogo, now what happens?A: We will be in touch to arrange shipping once the Flex-Eboard and Rough Stuff Wheels are ready.Q: What if theres a delay in production?A: We have built buffer periods into our predicted shipping time to allow for a delay at any stage from manufacture of the moulds to shipping. If however there is a delay we will notify you immediately and keep you well up to date on any change in the timescale.-------------Risks and challengesSlick Revolution is prepared to begin production of the Flex-Eboard at the conclusion of this campaign, however, with the release of any product, there may be unforeseen obstacles that could prevent us from getting certain elements of the product just right. As we strive to provide you with the ultimate user experience and would not feel comfortable releasing any product until it is perfect, there is always the possibility of delays.We promise to do our best to keep you as up to date as possible on any and all Flex-Eboard related developments and are working to reduce as many issues as possible before the Flex-Eboard and Rough Stuff Wheels official release.",26.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We need to raise $3000 to pay off an auto loan for a vehicle that we haven't had possession of for 14 months due to a three vehicle accident.  These beautiful children are being driven in a vehicle which places them in danger each time they put on their seat belts.</p>
<p><strong>OUR STORY</strong></p>
<p>My children and I were in a three vehicle accident in late 2011, and didn't have insurance because we were struggling to keep up with our bills.  Since the accident, we have been driving our children in a 2004 Pontiac Sunfire that is not safe for my daughters because of the lack of space and safety features for a small car (my oldest daughter isn't in a booster seat - which is illegal).  We are not even sure that this current vehicle will pass the Virginia safety inspection.  Unfortunately, we still have to make the monthly payments and keep full collision insurance  (over $600/mo.) on a minivan that is sitting in a junkyard.</p>
<p>We have been struggling with so many others since the economy collapsed in late 2008. My wife and I were both laid off within six weeks of each other and had to move from Michigan to Virginia for our family's survival. We both are considered underemployed, but we keep our heads high because we work hard and view the last few years as ""bumps in the road"". </p>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>1. We need to raise $3000 to pay off the current loan. No amount is too small.</p>
<p>2. Paying off this loan will allow us to use our tax refund as a down payment on a safer vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>What you get in return</strong></p>
<p>1.  We have a few perks to offer, these perks were originally given to me as gifts.  The estimated arrival time is just that; I will send you the perk you chose in a very timely manner.</p>
<p>2. You will know that you are helping three girls get into a vehicle that won't endanger their lives every time they travel.</p>
<p>3. Your generosity will allow my family to increase our giving to others in need. We always help those in need in any way that we can (food, money, free babysitting for mothers who work at night).  I recently gave gift cards that I received from work to someone who has no heat and water, even though we really could have used them for gas/groceries.</p>

<p>Veterans supporting veterans! Our members support our troops
stateside, the sandbox, and wherever else as necessary. Our Club members have
and are serving in Iraq, Afghanistan and other locations worldwide as either
members of the military, civil service or civilian contractors.  If you support the United States, her soldiers,
and the power of healing after war time then support our project!  The interaction alone offers a mix of unconditional trust,
bonding, love, healing and affection, helping the active duty or veteran rider affected by war to heal on
the open road.</p>
<p>Veterans helping veterans to heal! Please show your support and
enlist others in our mission to honor and empower veterans helping wounded
warriors to heal through motorcycle riding. 
Motorcycles provide a unique program of open air freedom on the road,
calming scenery, passion for traveling and brotherhood.  Our service to the nation is rooted in
loyalty, selfless service, integrity and honor, the same values found in our
motorcycle brotherhood.</p>
<p>Many veterans confront obstacles as they transition into
civilian life, and today's veterans and wounded veterans are meeting multiple
obstacles including, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and physical
injuries.  Your efforts will raise funds
to help our military veteran motorcycle club aid and assist wounded veterans to heal.  Saluting Veteran motorcycle riders
and the bold statement each veteran makes to the world, our MC helps
veterans move onward. Please help us make a difference in the lives of military
veteran motorcyclists.</p>
<p>What We Need:</p>
<p>1) We need a four thousand (4,000) square foot concrete
parking lot to park motorcycles before and after therapeutic riding.  4,000 sqft = 74 cubic yards at 6 inches depth
* $75 per yard = $5,550</p>
<p>2) We need an eight foot security fence to limit access
during closed hours.  41 (8 foot
sections) * $60 each = $2,460</p>
<p>3) We need electrical services installed by a licensed
electrician. Three cost estimates at $1,700 for parts, supplies and labor.</p>
<p>4) We need a camera security system for 24 hour surveillance
of the premises.  Cost at Best Buy and
Tiger Direct $290</p>
<p>*If you don’t reach your entire goal, funds will fund a
smaller parking lot.</p>
<p>The Impact:  Your contribution
will empower veterans to help heal wounded veterans affected by war to bond and
heal by guiding them down the road to success while leaving wounds in the rear
view mirrors of their iron horses.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help: 
Please spread the word on facebook, email and shout out to your friends
about helping veterans help veterans heal. You can use the Indiegogo share

The first glance brings to mind the past days of the 30s and 40s. In those times things were designed to be beautiful, functional and everlasting. This idea inspired us through all stages of design.You'll feel motorcycle sensibilities without a license or registration. First was the idea to create an electric bike that would be characterized by unique and beautiful form.  Our inspiration dates back to the most amazing times of motorization full bloom. We combine it with aviation stylistics and engineering.  The AVIONICS V1 spring looks like an aerofoil and hangs on the front of the frame head. It is made of manually polished stainless steel completed with a wooden saddle.  AVIONICS V1 is a raw, spartan piece of equipment.Its main task is to bring joy! AVIONICS V1 has a rich soul. It is not just another piece of steel coming from the assembly line. It is created in small workshops by passionate beauty lovers, who see their work as a sort of mission, not just a duty. Their respect for nature, art, and technology is obvious in every element of their work.Avionics V1 is the future without noise and exhaust. Freedom of movement in harmony with nature.The heart of AVIONICS V1 is electronics. Our e-bike deserves the best, that’s why we equipped it with sine-wave controller. This solution is used in electric motorcycles and means advanced on-board computer. It is a fully customizable, high-end, FOC controller offering full torque from zero RPM, regenerative braking, and noiseless operation.The battery must be strong and reliable. No matter what the e-bike looks like – its battery makes it useful. Our electrical engineers took on the challenge of battery design and at the same time, the rest of our team took care of the frame and wooden elements production. Everything had to match. There was no space for mistakes. There was no compromise – design and functionality had to come together.  As a standard, each AVIONICS V1 will receive a 8A charger. It will allow a full battery charge in three hours. Have enough power to climb any hill.  Chrome plated headlightPowered by Cree®XLamp XM-L LED bulbs.

<p>Riding the LEIF captures the exhilaration, mechanics and feel of snowboarding. The same snowboarding body movements produce the same result and ride on pavement.</p>
<p>Carving on the LEIF allows the you to lean hard into turns and cut across the pavement. Sliding on the LEIF feels as though the board is cutting through the pavement like a freshly-groomed mountain slope.</p>

<br/><p>Q: What is the difference between the LEIF and other electric skateboards?</p>
<p>A: The LEIF rides just like a snowboard - which means it is able to ride sideways, forwards, backwards or any direction the rider directs the board. Since the board has two motors, it is now possible to ride like a snowboard across flat ground or even uphill.</p>
<p>Q: How does the LEIF ride like a snowboard?</p>
<p>A: The LEIF allows the rider to slide and carve with the same mechanics and feel found in snowboarding. Snowboarders find the LEIF familiar, since the same body movements produce the same style of ride.</p>
<p>Carving on the LEIF allows the rider to lean hard into turns and cut across the pavement. Sliding on the LEIF feels as though the board is cutting through the pavement like a freshly-groomed ski slope.</p>
<p>Q: How fast does the LEIF go?</p>
<p>A: The LEIF can reach speeds up to 20mph using a wireless remote. There is no minimum speed to ride the LEIF, so the rider can move at their own pace.</p>
<p>Q: How does the rider stop?</p>
<p>A: The LEIF is able to stop just like a snowboard - by sliding and using the friction of the outside wheels just like the edge of a snowboard.</p>
<p>Q: How far does the LEIF go on one charge?</p>
<p>A: The final prototype will have a riding range of no less than 8 miles, allowing the majority of commuters to snowboard all the way their destination before re-charging - which only takes one hour.</p>
<p>Q: How can I get my own LEIF?</p>
<p>A: Special pricing will be available on the LEIF IndieGoGo page until December 27th. After that, reserve orders will be taken and fulfilled at retail pricing (about $1,500) after the Kickstarter product run has been delivered. </p>

If you missed out on the crowdfunding campaign, you can still pre-order your LEIF here.
Every snowboarder knows the pain of taking that last run -- having to wait until the next vacation or season to ride again. At LEIF, we dreamed of a future where snowboarding was not confined to the snow and mountains, but accessible to everyone, anywhere.

Now, you can practice your switch riding, carving and sliding - all year long!

""LEIF's skateboard is insanely fun and surprisingly easy. Even though I've never snowboarded before, I think I can get the hang of this and carve through the streets"" The Verge
""Its unique hardware appears to create a ride that's about as fast and flowy as you can have while standing up on hot asphalt."" Gizmag
""So, whether you're a snowboarder, skater, surfer or a Segway user who's looking for a bit more style, the LEIF should probably be on your radar."" Engadget

The LEIF is your snowboard away from the mountain.
Riding the LEIF captures the exhilaration, mechanics and feel of snowboarding. The same snowboarding body movements produce the same result and ride on pavement.
Carving on the LEIF allows the you to lean hard into turns and cut across the pavement. Sliding on the LEIF feels as though the board is cutting through the pavement like a freshly-groomed mountain slope.



Slide to a stop just like a snowboard.
Control braking using the same intuitive process found in snowboarding - no mechanical brake system required. Safe, intuitive and confident stopping power.

Ride Sideways at 20mph.

The incredible freedom of movement of a snowboard is what you get while riding the LEIF on your city streets.



Ergonomic wireless remote control.

The LEIF is controlled by a wireless remote that won't fall out of your hand. The simplicity of the thumb slider will let you know exactly how much power is being sent to the LEIF at any given time - keeping you cruising at your speed.




No hiking or lift ticket required.
With the LEIF, you have the snowboard, the mountain and the chairlift. Ride with a group of friends, or set out on your own quest with everything you need to get where you're going - and get back home.
From city streets, to bike lanes to country roads - now you can ride all year long.



The LEIF is easy to learn.
Snowboarders will find the LEIF familiar and easy to pick up. Here's a video of one Instagram fan's experience on his first moments on the LEIF: 

Turn your streets into your mountain.
We have developed a fully functioning prototype, allowing you to ride your streets like a snowboard. Control your speed up to 20 mph, with the power to blast through slides, climb hills, carve big turns and stop on a dime.
Our innovative power system is designed to deliver power in any direction, giving you the freedom to ride forward, backwards, sideways, and even uphill.

We have <b>completed the final prototype for both Surge and Ampere</b>; there will be no need for changes for any aspect of our bikes. You can be assured that there will be no hiccups or events that will delay shipment.</p>

<h2><b>Technical</b></h2>
<p><b>Is there a warranty?</b></p>
<p>Shocke Bikes provides a 1 year warranty on Surge and Ampere that covers electrical and frame.</p>
<p><b>What is the recommended rider's height for Ampere?</b></p>
<p>Ampere is recommended for riders who are between 5'4"" - 6'2"".</p>
<p><b>What is the recommended rider's height for Surge?</b></p>
<p>Surge is recommended for riders who are between 5'6"" - 6'4"".</p>
<p><b>What is the rider weight limit?</b></p>
<p>Maximum recommended weight is 120kg (265lbs).</p>
<p><b>How much does Ampere and Surge weigh?</b></p>
<p>Approximately 21.5 kg (47.5 lbs) including the battery for both Surge and Ampere.</p>
<p><b>What about leaving Surge/Ampere out in the rain?</b></p>
<p>The motor and battery are adequately sealed from the rain, and are thus protected.</p>
<p><b>Do I need a license?</b></p>
<p>No. Surge and Ampere's motors are programmed to go no more than 32 km/hr (20 mph) on throttle mode alone (no pedaling), and therefore do not require a license to operate in Canada/ USA. Local bylaw may vary, so please check the bylaw before operation.</p>
<p><b>Do I have to pedal?</b></p>
<p><b></b>
</p>
<p>No.
Surge and Ampere can operate by simply applying the thumb throttle without
pedaling. However, in order to get exercise and extend the range of the
battery, we highly recommend that you pedal as well.</p>
<b>Can
I ride Surge/Ampere as a regular bicycle, without the electric power? <br/></b><p></p>
<p>Yes, and it is very easy to switch back and forth. For example, you may
use the power only when you are going up hills and turn it off for level ground
and downhill riding to save battery power.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>Is
the battery replaceable?</h4>
<p>Most
definitely. The battery is very easy to take out and swap with a new one.</p>
<strong>Does Surge and Ampere come assembled?</strong>
<p>You
will receive your new Surge and Ampere 80% assembled. All you will need to do
is twist and tighten the handlebars, tighten the front wheel, plug in the seat
and pedals, and tighten them. The shipping container would be much larger (think of
the handlebars and pedals in place) with 100% assembly, so shipping the eBike
only 80% assembled allows us to cut costs and pass the savings to you. We will provide an installation and operation manual.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>How
many charges can I get out of a battery?</h4>
<p>Shocke
Bikes uses Samsung lithium-ion battery technology. Each battery will provide
approximately 1000 “full” charges. The battery has no memory effect, so if you
recharge the battery when it is only 50% depleted, that counts as only half a
charge. The amount of charges will also be impacted by factors such as
temperature.</p>
<h4>What
is the range I can get from a single charge?</h4>
<p>You
can expect about 45 miles (70 km) on a single charge for Surge or Ampere, and
often times you might go even further. If you only use the throttle, you can
expect Surge and Ampere to have a 22 miles (35 km) range. Range will also be impacted by
other factors, such as battery capacity, hills, wind resistance and your size.</p>

Simply put, Ampere and Surge are our ways
to cater to the diversity of cyclists out there. Ampere is a Dutch style
step-through, propelled by a 350W rear hub motor; Surge is a 700c performance
hybrid, propelled by a 350W mid-drive motor.      Both electric bicycles come with a variety of motor assistance modes, and a battery that provides a superior range for your everyday activities. Hop on and bring out your inner explorer!What's right for me?





We designed our electric bicycles to look, well, more like regular bicycles, discarding all superfluous components. The result? Electric bicycles that even the purists rave about.    It's all in the battery!
We designed our electric
bicycles centered around the heart of the vehicle, the battery. Our bicycles
boast an industry leading in-frame integrated battery design that makes
charging and replacing simple and practical.
    
  
Adjust to your liking.
Ampere and Surge come equipped with adjustable stems, so that you can adjust them to suit your needs, whether you're a speedster or a casual rider.
                             Get out there!
Go further than you ever have,
and faster, too. With a 70 km range (45 miles), Ampere and Surge are equipped with pedal assist
to help you get from point A to Z. The 350W motor carries both Surge and Ampere at 32
km/h (20 mph), powered by a 36V high energy-density lithium-ion battery. Long distances
and challenging landscapes never seemed like a piece of cake!     


Be in total control.

Ampere and Surge are equipped with a carefully designed thumb throttle and a 7-speed gear changer at your fingertips so that you can unleash and regulate power on demand. This is complemented with premium disc brakes on the front and rear wheels for Ampere and premium electric bike designed v-brakes on the front and rear wheels for Surge.
 
    



Smart, too. 
Surge and Ampere come equipped
with a LCD backlit display that indicates speed, distance traveled, motor
assistance level, battery voltage, and much more. Challenge yourself every time
you ride and beat your old record like a boss.

 

Light it up!
To ensure safety during night rides, Ampere and Surge come equipped with wireless turn signal lights and laser illuminated lanes. The wireless controller is at your fingertips so that you can keep your hands on the bar instead of in the air. Ride with confidence knowing that you will be seen in the darkest conditions!

Risks and challenges
We have begun small batch manufacturing by leveraging our assets. We need your help to streamline our production and assembly process in order to increase production capacity; and this costs money. There are certainly challenges we may face during the streamlining phase of our project, after its been successfully funded. Fear not however, because our team has made several contingency plans for every roadblock on the way. 

We have thought of every potential obstacle we may face so that you don’t have to. We are ready to face challenges that are thrown at us and we will give our 100% to follow through even when faced with the toughest of these challenges. Even if for some reason we cannot deliver, we promise to be completely transparent and keep our backers informed and up-to-date on our progress. The range of professional competencies and experience our team has under its belt will undoubtedly Shocke you into a believer!
What makes us different is that we have completed all our supplier sourcing and product testing in advance. We have completed the final prototype for both Surge and Ampere; there will be no need for changes for any aspect of our bikes. You can be assured that there will be no hiccups or events that will delay shipment.
The team at Shocke Bikes have the experience and know-how in order to fulfill our set timeline. We were able to deliver on our previous campaign on time and without any issues. All of our previous backers were ecstatic about their bicycles. and we are sure you will love your Surge and/or Ampere.


Thank you!
Over the past year, we have worked very hard to bring our concept of Surge and Ampere into a prototype. Please spread the word, join the revolution, and help make Surge and Ampere a reality for cyclists everywhere.
It is only through your support that we can reach our fundraising goal of $40,000 and build a large production run of bicycles. 
Thank you so very much!
Hasan & the Shocke Bikes team



Shocke Bikes was founded in 2014 with the goal of bringing affordable high quality electric bicycles to North America. We want cycling to be a fun activity to a wide range of people, regardless of age, ability and gender.
   

Last year, through the support of hundreds of amazing people, we brought you Spark,the most versatile electric bicycle, to the market. We are proud to mention that we delivered the bicycle on time with all that we promised, and more. 
Since then we have made amazing connections with hundreds of people, and also learned a lot from our mistakes. Not only have we applied these lessons to Spark, but also to Ampere and Surge, bringing you two all-new urban electric bicycles like no other.

<h4 style=""text-align: center;font-weight: normal;color: #B20000;"">MEET ECLIPSE, THE NEXT GENERATION OF REVOLIGHTS</h4>
<p>Incorporating user feedback, Eclipse is the continuation of our quest to create higher safety standards for night time bike riding and making Revolights the most visible and functional bicycle lighting system on the market.                                                 </p>
<hr style=""border-color: #CCCCCC;""/>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;font-weight: normal;color: #B20000;"">EASIER TO INSTALL, EASIER TO USE</h4>
<p>We've made the installation of Revolights much easier with Eclipse. By eliminating cables and introducing a new rechargeable snap-in battery, the lights now have a streamlined, low-profile design.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444885694/jd1kxkuc1okg6ln4rx3u.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Eclipse now integrates the rechargeable battery directly in the rings themselves, thereby making the on/off switch more accessible and removing any need for cables and parts on the spokes or in the hub.                                                                                                                         </p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0122/8442/t/15/assets/skieo.gif?11033935160076617729"" src="""" style=""width: 100%;""/>
</div><div style=""text-align: justify;color: #444444;""> <p>It only takes a few minutes to install the lights. We are confident that anyone with any level of bicycle knowledge can get Revolights installed onto a bike. We also provide support through a number of avenues: with a detailed instruction book, instruction videos, our hotline, live chat and email.                </p>

<h4 style=""text-align: center;font-weight: normal;color: #B20000;"">SETTING A NEW STANDARD</h4>
<p>Traditional bike lights focus heavily on forward path illumination, use only a small blinking red light for rear visibility, and provide little to no side visibility. This leaves cyclists vulnerable and drivers straining to see them.</p>
<p>Our approach to bicycle lighting is different. Eclipse is the only 360º bicycle lighting solution that provides a legal headlight, functional brake light, and unmatched side visibility.                                                                                                                                                     </p>

Now with the added technology in Eclipse+, an entirely new dimension of functionality is possible. Eclipse+ will be a different model than Eclipse and will include bluetooth connectivity, new functions, and integrations with the Revolights App.                                                                                                                </div><div style=""text-align: justify;color: #444444;"">The Revolights App is currently still in development, but we’ve planned out a set of key features aimed at enhancing your commute, which you'll be able to access through the Revolights App on smart phones as well as a number of wearables with Eclipse+. The app will be compatible with Apple and Android devices and we will ideally add support for other platforms as well going forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </div><div style=""text-align: justify;color: #444444;"">While more features are in planning, the combination of Revolights App and Eclipse+ will give you access to a new dimension of functionality, such as:                                                                                                                                </div><div style=""text-align: justify;color: #444444;"">

LIGHTING THE WAY TO A SMARTER BICYCLE

Hello Indiegogo! It’s us, Revolights - great to meet you! We have some big things to share with you and we want to invite you to join us in making the roads safer for riders and drivers alike.
We're here on Indiegogo to bring to life a connected edition of our brand new Revolights Eclipse, called Eclipse+. With the Eclipse+ we've been able to make our lighting system smarter than ever before. Eclipse+ offers the same great functionality as Eclipse, but also adds Bluetooth connectivity to enable awesome new features through the new Revolights App.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 

IN THE PRESS

PRODUCT FEATURES
                                                                                                  
                                                        

MEET ECLIPSE, THE NEXT GENERATION OF REVOLIGHTS
Incorporating user feedback, Eclipse is the continuation of our quest to create higher safety standards for night time bike riding and making Revolights the most visible and functional bicycle lighting system on the market.                                                 

EASIER TO INSTALL, EASIER TO USE
We've made the installation of Revolights much easier with Eclipse. By eliminating cables and introducing a new rechargeable snap-in battery, the lights now have a streamlined, low-profile design.
 

Eclipse now integrates the rechargeable battery directly in the rings themselves, thereby making the on/off switch more accessible and removing any need for cables and parts on the spokes or in the hub.                                                                                                                          
 It only takes a few minutes to install the lights. We are confident that anyone with any level of bicycle knowledge can get Revolights installed onto a bike. We also provide support through a number of avenues: with a detailed instruction book, instruction videos, our hotline, live chat and email.                
 

SETTING A NEW STANDARD
Traditional bike lights focus heavily on forward path illumination, use only a small blinking red light for rear visibility, and provide little to no side visibility. This leaves cyclists vulnerable and drivers straining to see them.
Our approach to bicycle lighting is different. Eclipse is the only 360º bicycle lighting solution that provides a legal headlight, functional brake light, and unmatched side visibility.                                                                                                                                                     

  

MEET ECLIPSE+ AND THE REVOLIGHTS APPEclipse+ is our long awaited connected version of the Revolights product line. Now with the added technology in Eclipse+, an entirely new dimension of functionality is possible. Eclipse+ will be a different model than Eclipse and will include bluetooth connectivity, new functions, and integrations with the Revolights App.                                                                                                                The Revolights App is currently still in development, but we’ve planned out a set of key features aimed at enhancing your commute, which you'll be able to access through the Revolights App on smart phones as well as a number of wearables with Eclipse+. The app will be compatible with Apple and Android devices and we will ideally add support for other platforms as well going forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    While more features are in planning, the combination of Revolights App and Eclipse+ will give you access to a new dimension of functionality, such as:

RIDE TRACKINGWith the App, we will have a tailored set of ride tracking features. You’ll be able to track your distance, miles per hour, compete in challenges, and set goals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

COMMUTER TOOLSWe’ve also included new tools on the Revolights App to help make sure your commute goes smoothly. For instance, the Revolights App includes an intelligent weather forecast that helps to remind you to bring a coat in case it rains later or let you know that it’ll be sunny for the entire ride.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

SMARTER LIGHTSThe Revolights App now enables a whole new set of features that add even more functionality to the lights. With the Revolights App, you’ll be able to check your battery life and remotely turn on/off the lights. By sensing the time of day, your lights can also automatically turn on when you need light, like when you are about to ride at night or when the sun is setting.                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

TURN SIGNALSSince our first version we’ve received countless requests for turn signals and now with Eclipse+, we’re thrilled to be offering this functionality. You’ll be able to indicate which way you’re turning through our handlebar mounted control pad, through the app, or through gesture recognition with a supported smart watch. On activation, the rear light will indicate the direction on the respective side through blinking full circle.

HOW IT WORKS

The patented Revolights design consists of four narrow rings of LEDs, two white and two red, which mount directly to the front and rear wheels of your bicycle with the help of four spoke clips per wheel. The lights are powered by a USB-rechargeable battery that snaps directly into the rings. 
                                 .
Each wheel consists of 24 equally spaced bright LEDs, with 8 on at any given moment.  A fork-mounted magnet and an integrated accelerometer provide speed and orientation data to the rings, allowing the LEDs to illuminate only when oriented at the front or rear of the bicycle.                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                      By constantly tracking your wheel speed, Revolights is able to detect when you hit the brakes and alert traffic with a first of it’s kind brake light. Once a change in speed is sensed the red will flash at a rapid rate informing tailing traffic that you are decreasing speed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Unlike traditional spotlight style headlights, Revolights patented design creates a spread of light, lighting up the ground as well as elevated objects like street signs. The forward projecting headlight also meets all requirements to be recognized as a legal headlight in the U.S.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

CAMPAIGN
 What is the difference between Eclipse and Eclipse+?
FEATURES
How long is the battery life? 4 hours and they are recharged via USB.How bright is the headlight? There are a total of 24 LEDs on each wheel, 8 of which of are lit up at any given moment. Each LED is rated at over 35 lumens, but since our LEDs are continually rotating and lumens are a unit of flux (light/area) the most accurate description would be: Revolights brightness = 8 LEDs x 35 lumens each.What is the weight of Revolights? The complete weight is 11 oz per wheel.How are Revolights installed? Revolights have four ball-and-socket brackets that snap onto your spokes for easy attachment.How are Revolights theft resistant? Preventing thievery was an important consideration during the design phase. Because Revolights consist of a solid-ring body welded together during fabrication, the wheel must be removed from the bike in order to remove the Revolights. When you lock up your bike and wheels, you’re also locking up your Revolights.
COMPATIBILITY
What size wheels do Revolights fit? 700c wheels with a tire width of 38mm or less, spoke counts that are multiples of four, and have a front fork/rear chainstay opening is 40mm or more. Revolights for 700c/27inch wheels will also fit a 29"" tire, however generally the tires are quite wide (the max we support is 38mm). So depending on tires size you have they may block the ability for the lights to act as a headlight and taillight, but you will still have side visibility.Will Revolights fit with 700c wheels that have a tire width that is wider than 38mm? Revolights will still fit a tire width of 38mm or more but the tire will block the ability for the lights to act as a headlight and taillight, but you will still have side visibility.Will Revolights work with fenders? Revolights will work with fenders. However, if you have a rear fender the rear projection of light will be partially blocked from directly behind depending on how long the fenders are but the sides will still be completely visible.Are Revolights compatible with disc brakes? Revolights are compatible with disc brakes.Can Revolights handle wet and snow conditions? We went to great lengths to design Revolights to stand up to wet conditions. The electronics are fully sealed effectively isolating them from the environment. That said, exposure to salt or alkaline dust on the roads creates issues for most electronics, Revolights included. Lithium batteries can also slow their discharge rate during long-term exposure to extreme cold.

<p>When you get off your bike I LOCK IT measures the distance to your smartphone. As soon as you walk away from your bike I LOCK IT will move a 64 mm² thick stainless steel bolt through the rear wheel. This immobilizes your bike and prevents theft.</p>
<p>With I LOCK IT you don't have to pull out your keys or press any buttons. You can just walk away and be sure your bike is safe. </p>
<p>While automatic locking is a great feature you can also lock your bike by using your smartphone or by pressing the button on I LOCK IT. This gives you the flexibility to choose how you want to lock your bike.</p>

<p>Once in general proximity to your bike I LOCK IT automatically connects to your smartphone. And once you get closer to your bike it will automatically unlock for you.</p>
<p>No need to search for your keys. Just get on your bike and ride.</p>
<p>And if you just pass by your bike I LOCK IT will automatically unlock and lock again. So your bike will even be safe if you don't use it.</p>

<p>We build I LOCK IT with strong and durable materials to prevent your bike from being stolen. And to give you an extra layer of security we also added an alarm feature. The alarm works just like your car alarm and is automatically activated when I LOCK IT is locked.</p>
<p>If the alarm is active and someone tries to lift up your bike or tries to cut the locking bolt I LOCK IT will recognize this and set off a 110 dB loud alarm. This will scare the thief away and raise the attention of anyone in the area.</p>

<p>Additional to the acoustic alarm I LOCK IT will send a notification to your smartphone* if the alarm gets activated. So if you are in a shop or cafe nearby you can still react and protect your bike.</p>
<p>*Using Bluetooth technology notifications are possible in a range of up to 100 m/ 330 feet. </p>

<p>I LOCK IT uses smartphones to authenticate the user, so no need to think about keys.</p>

<p>I LOCK IT with its integrated alarm offers high security for your bike. But sometimes you might want to leave your bike for a longer time and secure it with a fixed object.  </p>
<p>That's why we created a special cable which can be easily plugged into I LOCK IT. Plugging the cable in is easy, fast and no extra lock is required.</p>
<p>Now bike thieves would have to break the lock and the cable. All while the loud alarm attracts everybody's attention. </p>
<p>The plug-in cable has a diameter of 10 mm / 0.4"" and a length of 90 cm / 35"".</p>
<p><b>Update: </b>New plug-in chain is now also available. The chain has a length of 80 cm / 31"" and weighs 700 g / 1,5 lbs.</p>

</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<br/>1. Measure the distance from your rear bike rim to the top of the tire (or the fender). If the distance is less than 106 mm / 4.1 inches check step 2.</div>

<p>Sobald du von deinem Fahrrad absteigst beginnt I LOCK IT damit die Distanz zu deinem Smartphone zu ermitteln. Bewegst du dich nun von deinem Fahrrad weg verriegelt I LOCK IT dein Hinterrad mit einem 64 mm² starken Schließbolzen aus rostfreiem Edelstahl. Dies verhindert, dass jemand mit deinem Fahrrad wegfahren kann.</p>
<p>MIT I LOCK IT musst du weder deinen Schlüssel suchen, noch irgendwelche Knöpfe betätigen. Du kannst dich einfach von deinem Fahrrad weg bewegen und dir sicher sein, dass es abgeschlossen ist.</p>
<p>Um dir mehr Flexibilität zu bieten kannst du I LOCK IT auch durch dein Smartphone oder den I LOCK IT Taster verriegeln. Dies ermöglicht dir eine Benutzung nach deinen Vorstellungen.</p>

<p>Und falls du mal an deinem Fahrrad vorbei gehst, ohne es zu benutzen dann schließt I LOCK IT automatisch auf und wieder zu. Dein Fahrrad ist also immer sicher, auch wenn du es nicht benutzt.</p>

<p>I LOCK IT wird aus langlebigen und widerstandsfähigen Materialien gefertigt, um dein Fahrrad vor Dieben zu schützen. Für einen zusätzlichen Schutz haben wir zudem eine Alarmanlage integriert. Der Alarm funktioniert wie deine Alarmanlage im Auto und ist automatisch aktiv, sobald I LOCK IT dein Fahrrad abgeschlossen hat.</p>
<p>Ist der Alarm aktiv und jemand versucht dein Fahrrad weg zu tragen oder den Schließbolzen zu durchtrennen löst I LOCK IT einen 110 dB lauten Alarm aus. Dies schreckt den Dieb ab und alarmiert jeden der sich in der Nähe befindet.</p>

</div>","I LOCK IT is a fully automatic smart bike lock that is fixed to your bike frame. It locks and unlocks your bike automatically using Bluetooth low energy technology. 
So no more pulling out your keys and struggling with your bike lock, you can just leave your bike and be sure it's safe.
I LOCK IT lets you enjoy life without the need to think about keys or bike locks. Just get on your bike and ride. And if you want to stop somewhere you can just leave your bike and be sure it's safe. Making sure your bike is safe has never been easier.


  

I LOCK IT offers many different features to help protect your bike: 


When you get off your bike I LOCK IT measures the distance to your smartphone. As soon as you walk away from your bike I LOCK IT will move a 64 mm² thick stainless steel bolt through the rear wheel. This immobilizes your bike and prevents theft.
With I LOCK IT you don't have to pull out your keys or press any buttons. You can just walk away and be sure your bike is safe. 
While automatic locking is a great feature you can also lock your bike by using your smartphone or by pressing the button on I LOCK IT. This gives you the flexibility to choose how you want to lock your bike.

  

 

  


Once in general proximity to your bike I LOCK IT automatically connects to your smartphone. And once you get closer to your bike it will automatically unlock for you.
No need to search for your keys. Just get on your bike and ride.
And if you just pass by your bike I LOCK IT will automatically unlock and lock again. So your bike will even be safe if you don't use it.



  



We build I LOCK IT with strong and durable materials to prevent your bike from being stolen. And to give you an extra layer of security we also added an alarm feature. The alarm works just like your car alarm and is automatically activated when I LOCK IT is locked.
If the alarm is active and someone tries to lift up your bike or tries to cut the locking bolt I LOCK IT will recognize this and set off a 110 dB loud alarm. This will scare the thief away and raise the attention of anyone in the area.

  

Additional to the acoustic alarm I LOCK IT will send a notification to your smartphone* if the alarm gets activated. So if you are in a shop or cafe nearby you can still react and protect your bike.
*Using Bluetooth technology notifications are possible in a range of up to 100 m/ 330 feet. 

  

I LOCK IT uses smartphones to authenticate the user, so no need to think about keys.
Using Bluetooth low energy technology the I LOCK IT app is compatible with iOS (5+) and Android (4.4+) devices. And once the app is running you never have to pull your smartphone out of your pocket again.

  

 
You don't have a smartphone or you simply don't want to take it with you riding? We've got you covered.
The optional I LOCK IT key fob works independent of a smartphone and also offers you automatic locking and unlocking. Additionally, you can lock and unlock I LOCK IT by pressing the key fob button.
With an integrated acoustic alarm, the key fob also offers theft notifications.



  

 
Forgot your phone or your battery died? Just enter your customized 8-digit code and I LOCK IT will unlock for you. The code can be easily customized in the I LOCK IT smartphone app.
And to lock your bike after you are done riding you just have to press the button on I LOCK IT.






 

 You want to let your friends or family use your bike, but you're not around to give them the key? 

With the I LOCK IT App you can easily share your bike with just a couple of clicks. Sharing your bike has never been easier.

  

 
I LOCK IT with its integrated alarm offers high security for your bike. But sometimes you might want to leave your bike for a longer time and secure it with a fixed object.  
That's why we created a special cable which can be easily plugged into I LOCK IT. Plugging the cable in is easy, fast and no extra lock is required.
Now bike thieves would have to break the lock and the cable. All while the loud alarm attracts everybody's attention. 
The plug-in cable has a diameter of 10 mm / 0.4"" and a length of 90 cm / 35"".
Update: New plug-in chain is now also available. The chain has a length of 80 cm / 31"" and weighs 700 g / 1,5 lbs.

  

 



Are you always forgetting where you left your bike? From now on the I LOCK IT App will make sure you don't have to search anymore. 
Every time you are done using your bike the I LOCK IT App will save the last position you left your bike at. So next time you want to go for a ride, just check your app and know where your bike is.
Note: I LOCK IT doesn't have an integrated GPS so tracking your bike in case it got stolen is currently not possible.


  

The basic configuration of I LOCK IT is set to fit most users needs.  But if you prefer your own settings the I LOCK IT App lets you customize many of the functions to fit your needs.

The following functions can be enabled and disabled:

Auto-unlocking
Auto-locking 
Alarm & theft notifications
Tracking
Click Code unlocking

When the auto-unlocking or auto-locking functions are active you can also change the proximity for locking and unlocking.


  

 

  

 

  

  



  

 


Update: new dimensions for new I LOCK IT version as seen in the update 


  

I LOCK IT is compatible with most bikes. To see if I LOCK IT fits your bike just follow these two easy steps:




1. Measure the distance from your rear bike rim to the top of the tire (or the fender). If the distance is less than 106 mm / 4.1 inches check step 2.





2. Measure how thick the tire is. If it's less than 64 mm / 2.5 inches I LOCK IT will fit your bike.




 


Your bike doesn't fit those measurements? Please send us a message to info@ilockit.bike and tell us your bike model. This way we can double check if there is another possibility to fit I LOCK IT to your bike.


  


I LOCK IT can be installed with a few quick steps. Just watch the videos below to see how it's done.

For bikes with mounting holes:



 



For bikes without mounting holes:



 The adapters used in the video for bikes without mounting holes are called ""trelock zr 20"". They are widely available online. Other adapters for wheel locks will most likely work as well.



  

 

  

 



 

  

The name of the company behind I LOCK IT is haveltec. Haveltec is a young startup which develops products that make life easier and more comfortable. To achieve this we use the latest technology in a way that it allows a simple and outstanding user experience.

I LOCK IT ist ein vollautomatisches, smartes Fahrradschloss welches fest mit deinem Fahrradrahmen verbunden ist. Es verriegelt und entriegelt dein Fahrrad automatisch durch die Verwendung von Bluetooth Low Energy Technologie.
Mit I LOCK IT musst du keinen Schlüssel in der Hosentasche suchen und dich nicht mehr über dein sperriges Fahrradschloss ärgern. Stattdessen kannst du einfach dein Fahrrad abstellen und du weißt, dass es gesichert ist.
I LOCK IT lässt dich das Leben genießen, ohne über Fahrradschlösser und Schlüssel nachdenken zu müssen. Du kannst einfach aufsteigen und losfahren. Und wenn du irgendwo anhältst kannst du einfach dein Fahrrad abstellen, ohne dich um irgendwas kümmern zu müssen. Dein Fahrrad zu sichern war noch nie so einfach.


  

I LOCK IT bietet dir viele verschiedene Funktionen welche dabei helfen dein Fahrrad zu schützen:








  

Sobald du von deinem Fahrrad absteigst beginnt I LOCK IT damit die Distanz zu deinem Smartphone zu ermitteln. Bewegst du dich nun von deinem Fahrrad weg verriegelt I LOCK IT dein Hinterrad mit einem 64 mm² starken Schließbolzen aus rostfreiem Edelstahl. Dies verhindert, dass jemand mit deinem Fahrrad wegfahren kann.
MIT I LOCK IT musst du weder deinen Schlüssel suchen, noch irgendwelche Knöpfe betätigen. Du kannst dich einfach von deinem Fahrrad weg bewegen und dir sicher sein, dass es abgeschlossen ist.
Um dir mehr Flexibilität zu bieten kannst du I LOCK IT auch durch dein Smartphone oder den I LOCK IT Taster verriegeln. Dies ermöglicht dir eine Benutzung nach deinen Vorstellungen.

 


  

Sobald du in der Umgebung deines Fahrrads bist stellt I LOCK IT automatisch eine Verbindung zu deinem Smartphone her. Und sobald du dich nun auf dein Fahrrad zubewegst wird dein Fahrrad automatisch entriegelt.
Keine Suche nach dem Schlüssel mehr. Einfach aufsteigen und losfahren.
Und falls du mal an deinem Fahrrad vorbei gehst, ohne es zu benutzen dann schließt I LOCK IT automatisch auf und wieder zu. Dein Fahrrad ist also immer sicher, auch wenn du es nicht benutzt.

  


I LOCK IT wird aus langlebigen und widerstandsfähigen Materialien gefertigt, um dein Fahrrad vor Dieben zu schützen. Für einen zusätzlichen Schutz haben wir zudem eine Alarmanlage integriert. Der Alarm funktioniert wie deine Alarmanlage im Auto und ist automatisch aktiv, sobald I LOCK IT dein Fahrrad abgeschlossen hat.
Ist der Alarm aktiv und jemand versucht dein Fahrrad weg zu tragen oder den Schließbolzen zu durchtrennen löst I LOCK IT einen 110 dB lauten Alarm aus. Dies schreckt den Dieb ab und alarmiert jeden der sich in der Nähe befindet.

  

Zusätzlich zum akustischen Alarm sendet I LOCK IT dir eine Benachrichtigung auf dein Smartphone* sobald der Alarm aktiviert wird. Wenn du also im Supermarkt oder im Café nebenan bist kannst du zusätzlich reagieren und nach deinem Fahrrad sehen.
*Durch die Benutzung von Bluetooth Technologie sind Benachrichtigungen in einem Umkreis von max. 100 m möglich.

  

I LOCK IT benutzt dein Smartphone, um dich zu authentifizieren, du musst also nicht an deinen Schlüssel denken.
Durch die Benutzung von Bluetooth Low Energy ist die I LOCK IT App mit iOS (5+) und Android (4.4+) Geräten kompatibel. Sobald die App einmal aktiv ist musst du dein Smartphone nicht mehr aus deiner Tasche holen.

 


  

Du besitzt kein Smartphone oder willst es einfach nicht zum Fahrradfahren mitnehmen? Wir haben eine Lösung für dich.
Der optionale I LOCK IT Handsender funktioniert unabhängig von einem Smartphone und ermöglicht dir ebenfalls das automatische Verriegeln und Entriegeln deines Fahrrades.

  

Du hast dein Smartphone vergessen oder der Akku ist leer? Gib einfach deinen 8-stelligen Code ein und I LOCK IT schließt für dich auf. Der Code kann ganz einfach in der I LOCK IT Smartphone App konfiguriert werden. Und wenn du deine Fahrt beendet hast kannst du ganz einfach den Taster nochmals betätigen und I LOCK IT schließt wieder ab.

Wenn das automatisches Aufschließen oder Abschließen aktiv ist kann zudem der Abstand hierfür konfiguriert werden.


 


  

  

 



Update: neue Dimensionen für überarbeitete I LOCK IT Version wie im Update vorgestellt.

 

  

I LOCK IT passt an die meisten Fahrräder. Um zu sehen ob es auch an deins passt kannst du ganz einfach die folgenden zwei Schritte durchführen:
1.	Messe die Distanz zwischen der Unterkannte deiner Hinterradfelge und der Oberkante deines Rades (oder Schutzblechs). Ist die Distanz geringer als 106 mm dann überprüfe bitte den zweiten Schritt.




2.	Messe wie dick dein Reifen ist. Ist diese Distanz geringer als 64 mm dann passt I LOCK IT an dein Fahrrad.




I LOCK IT scheint nicht an dein Fahrrad zu passen? Schick uns bitte eine Nachricht an info@ilockit.bike, nenne uns dein Fahrrad Model und wir prüfen, ob I LOCK IT eventuell anders installiert werden kann.


  

I LOCK IT kann mit ein paar einfachen Schritten am Fahrrad installiert werden. Schau dir einfach die Videos an, um zu sehen wie es funktioniert.
•	Für Fahrräder mit Befestigungslöcher für Rahmenschlösser



Für Fahrräder ohne Befestigungslöcher



Die im Video für Fahrräder ohne Befestigungslöcher benutzten Adapter haben die Bezeichnung „trelock zr 20“. Diese sind in vielen Onlineshops erhältlich. Andere Adapter für Rahmenschlösser können ebenfalls mit I LOCK IT kompatibel sein.

<p><br/><br/><strong>Juiced Bikes</strong> is a California-based company offering innovative and top-performing electric mobility products at an accessible, practical price. By using a direct-to-consumer distribution model, Juiced eliminates redundancy in an otherwise outdated supply chain to create a more affordable purchasing path for its customers. </p>
<p>The company was founded in 2009 by Tora Harris who graduated from Princeton University with a degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Harris is a record-breaking high jump champion, five-time American Champion, and a 2004 Olympian. His passionate commitment to academic pursuits and athletic competition is now devoted to developing high performance personal mobility products that take customers on a life-changing ride. </p>
<p>Originally established as an importer of Lithium-Ion batteries, Juiced Bikes quickly progressed to developing electric bikes with the inventive and functional ODK Utility e-bike launching in 2010. Juiced products are designed, engineered, and supported by a team in San Diego, California and produced to exacting quality specifications. We take enormous pride in setting performance standards for range, quality, durability, affordability, and service support for the global electric bike industry. With a fierce commitment to utilizing advanced technologies to optimally distribute and support our products, Juiced ensures an efficient, reliable and trusted connection with our customers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569227933/yk4lfbqrkfcbjb6a3ihn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>TORA HARRIS<br/>FOUNDER &amp; CEO </strong></p>
<p>Tora Harris is the founder of Juiced Bikes, an industry leader in electric bicycle design, manufacturing, sales, and distribution. Tora has led Juiced since its beginnings in 2009 as a Li-Ion battery pack manufacturer, releasing his first in-house designed bike in 2011.  His vehicle designs have set high standards for the e-bike industry, many of which have yet to be met by competitors:</p>
<p> <strong>   2014 </strong>   ODK U500 Cargo Bike - 48V 32Ah (1.5kWh) battery  pack</p>
<p>    <strong>2015  </strong>  CrossCurrent - First high-performance e-bike under $1500</p>
<p><strong>    2017 </strong>   HyperFat HF1000 - First production e-bike with a 1000W MAC motor    </p>
<p><strong>    2019 </strong>    CrossCurrent S2 - First and only company to use  52V battery platform across the entire e-bike portfolio</p>
<p>Under Tora’s leadership, Juiced Bikes transitioned to a direct-to-consumer distribution model in January 2017, dramatically reducing consumer pricing for high-performance e-bikes, while improving the efficiency of the product development process from ideation to launch. Fiercely committed to providing riders with the highest quality e-bikes at an affordable price, Tora strategically utilized a crowdfunding campaign in the Summer of 2018 to release the company’s line of super-premium Scrambler electric bikes. The success of the campaign, speed of order fulfillment, top-rated customer satisfaction, and the high degree of transparency delivered to backers throughout production are all impressive examples of the company’s dedication to exceeding the expectations of their loyal customers and supporters.  </p>
<p>A fluent Mandarin speaker, Tora spends a great deal of time in China working directly with his design, engineering, and manufacturing teams. He is uniquely positioned to access relevant technology as soon as it’s available, and with capabilities to develop new innovations that don’t yet exist. </p>
<p>Tora was a 4-time All American high jumper at Princeton, winning the high jump at NCAA Outdoor Championship in 2002.  He graduated in 2002 with a BSE in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and embarked upon a successful professional athletic career after graduation. Tora won 4 US National Championships in high jump and competed on the US Olympic team in 2004 in Athens, Greece.  Tora retired from international athletics in 2012 to exclusively focus on leading the rapid growth of the Juiced Bikes organization. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>

Juiced Bikes is a California-based company offering innovative and top-performing electric mobility products at an accessible, practical price. By using a direct-to-consumer distribution model, Juiced eliminates redundancy in an otherwise outdated supply chain to create a more affordable purchasing path for its customers. 
The company was founded in 2009 by Tora Harris who graduated from Princeton University with a degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Harris is a record-breaking high jump champion, five-time American Champion, and a 2004 Olympian. His passionate commitment to academic pursuits and athletic competition is now devoted to developing high performance personal mobility products that take customers on a life-changing ride. 
Originally established as an importer of Lithium-Ion batteries, Juiced Bikes quickly progressed to developing electric bikes with the inventive and functional ODK Utility e-bike launching in 2010. Juiced products are designed, engineered, and supported by a team in San Diego, California and produced to exacting quality specifications. We take enormous pride in setting performance standards for range, quality, durability, affordability, and service support for the global electric bike industry. With a fierce commitment to utilizing advanced technologies to optimally distribute and support our products, Juiced ensures an efficient, reliable and trusted connection with our customers.

TORA HARRISFOUNDER & CEO 
Tora Harris is the founder of Juiced Bikes, an industry leader in electric bicycle design, manufacturing, sales, and distribution. Tora has led Juiced since its beginnings in 2009 as a Li-Ion battery pack manufacturer, releasing his first in-house designed bike in 2011.  His vehicle designs have set high standards for the e-bike industry, many of which have yet to be met by competitors:
    2014    ODK U500 Cargo Bike - 48V 32Ah (1.5kWh) battery  pack
    2015    CrossCurrent - First high-performance e-bike under $1500
    2017    HyperFat HF1000 - First production e-bike with a 1000W MAC motor    
    2019     CrossCurrent S2 - First and only company to use  52V battery platform across the entire e-bike portfolio
Under Tora’s leadership, Juiced Bikes transitioned to a direct-to-consumer distribution model in January 2017, dramatically reducing consumer pricing for high-performance e-bikes, while improving the efficiency of the product development process from ideation to launch. Fiercely committed to providing riders with the highest quality e-bikes at an affordable price, Tora strategically utilized a crowdfunding campaign in the Summer of 2018 to release the company’s line of super-premium Scrambler electric bikes. The success of the campaign, speed of order fulfillment, top-rated customer satisfaction, and the high degree of transparency delivered to backers throughout production are all impressive examples of the company’s dedication to exceeding the expectations of their loyal customers and supporters.  
A fluent Mandarin speaker, Tora spends a great deal of time in China working directly with his design, engineering, and manufacturing teams. He is uniquely positioned to access relevant technology as soon as it’s available, and with capabilities to develop new innovations that don’t yet exist. 
Tora was a 4-time All American high jumper at Princeton, winning the high jump at NCAA Outdoor Championship in 2002.  He graduated in 2002 with a BSE in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, and embarked upon a successful professional athletic career after graduation. Tora won 4 US National Championships in high jump and competed on the US Olympic team in 2004 in Athens, Greece.  Tora retired from international athletics in 2012 to exclusively focus on leading the rapid growth of the Juiced Bikes organization. The rest, as they say, is history.

Problem 
①Fossil fuels dependency 


The limits of growth is actually happing. Around 2020, more than 8 billion in the world can not live since the food and the human resource is gone. Especially, the oil will be gone in 40 years. In the long term, human being will move to the sustainable 
civilization. Energy is civilization base and driving power.


In the energy sector, Asia will be a big consumer of the oil. Also major consumption o f the oil is used in the transportation sector. Thus, it will be valuable to make the transportation alternative way.
②Poverty 


In Asia,there are 1.7 billion people who are living on less than 2 USD a day. In many cases, the kind of people work at the local public transportation driver. Specifically, roughly 10 % of the Philippines people is working at this industry. Our electric mobility can double their income.
③Air pollution





This is the situation in Vietnam. 16000 people die because of the air pollutions in Vietnam 2007 (AIT). Also,5000 people die because of the air pollutions in the Philippines in 2010  ADB). According to the date, Asia will be more CO2 emissions place due to the economic&population growth. We need to stop this with our innovative product.
Our challenge for problem
We have been already developing the electric three wheelers in the Philippines.


We have done the feasible study around Asia with this mobility so we modify the design to meet the requirement. The final design will be like below.

We would like to develop this and expand this mobility around Asia.
Your supports help us

We appreciate your  support. We will use your perk for the mass production type of the development cost. We can develop the model and expand this around Asia  if you support us.

are very few people who realise how many things have to be taken into
consideration before launching a new product like Citylite and if they did most
people would never even start, even though they had a great idea. Luckily there
are people who not only have great ideas but also have the energy, courage and
belief to carry it through. One of these people is Lars Beck, the man behind
Citylite.</span><p></p>
<p></p><h2>Compact bicycle lights without brackets</h2><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It’s
actually 20 years ago since Lars Beck first got the idea for a compact set of
bicycle lights that could snap directly onto the bicycle without requiring a
bracket. He approached some of the leading companies within the bicycle
industry and ended up selling the design to one of the major players in the
bicycle market. Unfortunately the company put the product in the draw. So what
do you do if you believe that you have a brilliant idea that you want to see on
the market. You take a deep breath and push on. That’s what Lars Beck did
anyway and eventually managed to get the product into production and launch it
in several countries in Europe. But his troubles were far from over and a
competition clause put the adventure on hold. Lars fought hard for several
years to keep hold of his patents and that is why Lars now again is on his way
out into the world with his bicycle lights – a simple idea that makes life
easier and safer for all cyclists and this is at a time when the bicycle is
more popular than ever, both at home and around the world.</span></p>
<p></p><h2>A brilliant idea and a lump of plasticine</h2><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">One could write many words about all those years
of hard work on Citylite. But if one should mention the key elements in the
journey that Lars has travelled, then it started with a lump of plasticine
which he rode around with on his handlebar. He knew he had got a brilliant
idea, but how could he take it further?</span></p>
<p></p><h2>Ups and downs</h2><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The little lump of plasticine was the beginning
of an adventure that really has had its ups and downs. Lars wanted to study
product design but this meant that he first had to learn to draw. He spent
several years improving this talent and eventually applied to the Danish Design
School, but didnt pass the entry exam. Instead he applied to several design
courses abroad and in the end chose to study Product Design &amp; Manufacture
at a university in England. This has obviously given him key knowhow within the
field of product development and manufacturing.</span><p></p>
<p></p><h2>The right contacts</h2><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-weight: normal;"">A
brilliant idea is one thing, financing and production is something else. But
when you have a passion for something there’s always a solution. Lars began
looking for investors for his project and through a number of coincidences
brought him to Deloitte and Touche Corporate Finance in Southampton, England.
They were so convinced of his idea that they assisted him in writing a business
plan and soon Lars was negotiating with some of the largest companies in the
bicycle business. The future was looking bright, literally! But then, as it
happens all too often with good ideas, it was bought and filed away on
strategic grounds. However, that wasn’t much help to Lars, he wanted to see his
idea on the market.</span></p>
<p></p><h2>Patents and provisions</h2><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A brilliant idea can quickly get buried in
legalities and economics. In principle, Lars owned the rights to his own
product but the company that had bought the rights but never actually
produced it objected. Lars spent the next five years fighting to keep his
patents in place while taking on a number of different jobs that had nothing to
do with design. He always kept a prototype of Citylite in his pocket so that he
could remind himself why he was there at times of despair.</span></p>
<p></p><h2>Back on his bike and on the road again</h2><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A couple of years ago Lars succeeded in finally
getting his project back on track with a new and ultimate version called
Citylite. Finally the world’s most compact set of bicycle lights will soon be
lighting the way for cyclists in cities all over the world. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It has been a dream for many years but having
overcome a number of challenges along the way it began to be a reality again
from 2010 and in this connection Lars would like to say thank you to those
people who have shown their belief in him and have been willing to support and
assist him in realizing his dream come true without any promise of an immediate
return. Their support and effort has made all the difference.</span></p><br/><h2>The Unending War of Vehicles VS. Bicyclists</h2><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Throughout most of the world, cops on the scene of accidents immediately and invariably, assume
the cyclist is at fault! Bicycle riders have reason to fear for their lives. In
America, The New York Times, in a study of accidents involving a bicycle
and a vehicle, asked “Is it O.K. to Kill Cyclists?” Google “cyclist + accident”
and you will find that cops on the scene of accidents immediately and
invariably, assume the cyclist is at fault! </span><br/></p>
<p>Bicycle
riders have reason to fear for their lives. </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><h2>The Need For Bicycle Lighting So You Can See - And Be Seen! </h2><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">For
whatever reason, this proven antipathy against bicycle riders by drivers become
even more perilous in the dark streets of metropolitan areas, especially noted
and reported in New York City since the implementation of their CityBike
program. No doubt some of the conflict is caused by bicyclists disregarding
traffic laws, but there is a distinct, almost criminal disregard by government
to greatly improve bicycle safety by making it mandatory for bicyclists to have
a proper lighting system when riding at night.</span><br/></p>

<p>Citylite is a truly international team of
individuals. Founded in Denmark, our team includes experts in different fields
incl. low-energy circuitry, light and optics, tool making, ultra-sonic welding,
located in the Germany, Holland, Ireland, United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>Over the years, our team has worked for
world-class companies, including HP, Duracell, Samsung, Sony, Procter &amp;
Gamble to name just a few. A testimony to the team’s knowhow and abilities. Our
team has more than 30 years of experience with consumer product design.</p>
<p>Each team member has a real passion for Citylite
and we obviously all enjoy riding our bikes.</p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h2>Project Status<br/>
</h2><p>
</p><p>To produce Citylite I have
set up production in Denmark so that I can have full control with the
manufacturing process and the quality. Therefore I can proudly say that
Citylite is Danish design, engineered, manufactured and assembled in Denmark.</p>
<p>I have successfully completed my pilot run and proved the manufacturing process and I can therefore
confidently say that it can be done, that I can do it and that your funds will
not be wasted.</p>
<p>Because new product development
and mass manufacture is a risky business during the early stages, spending <i>your</i> money before having proved that it
can actually be made into a real product, would not be fair. Therefore I have
already developed and covered the costs of the initial soft tooling required to
prove the design and the ability to manufacture and assemble the product successfully. I developed the initial injection molds in aluminum because this material is
considerably cheaper than fully hardened steel that is needed for mass
manufacture. The downside is that the aluminum molds can only make a limited
number of lights before losing their tolerances. </p>
<p>What you see in the pictures
are actual injection molded samples, not prototypes made from 3D printing –
this is the real thing!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/214681/files/20131121125902-status.jpg?1385067542"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>I am now ready to confidently deliver Citylites to you and as soon as I meet the Indiegogo funding goal I will start production of the exclusive
limited editions for all of you.</p>
<h2><br/></h2><h2>Funding Budget</h2><p>
</p><p>I have been working on this Ying &amp; Yang design concept for many years
now, but to make Citylite available for everyone around the world at a
reasonable price, I need to go into mass production. Citylite is now finally
ready and I am therefore seeking to crowd source demand upfront through
Indiegogo.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help fund:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full hardened steel
     production tooling for mass manufacture</li>
<li>Development of a USB
     chargeable version</li>
<li>Large component orders</li>

</p><p>During the last 14 months Citylite has been recognized and validated by
design and industry experts around the world - Proof of concept and a testimony
to its functionality, performance and high design quality.</p>
<p>All together Citylite has won 7 international design and innovation

competition clause put the adventure on hold. Lars fought hard for several
years to keep hold of his patents and that is why Lars now again is on his way
out into the world with his bicycle lights – a simple idea that makes life
easier and safer for all cyclists and this is at a time when the bicycle is
more popular than ever, both at home and around the world.
A brilliant idea and a lump of plasticineOne could write many words about all those years
of hard work on Citylite. But if one should mention the key elements in the
journey that Lars has travelled, then it started with a lump of plasticine
which he rode around with on his handlebar. He knew he had got a brilliant
idea, but how could he take it further?
Ups and downsThe little lump of plasticine was the beginning
of an adventure that really has had its ups and downs. Lars wanted to study
product design but this meant that he first had to learn to draw. He spent
several years improving this talent and eventually applied to the Danish Design
School, but didnt pass the entry exam. Instead he applied to several design
courses abroad and in the end chose to study Product Design & Manufacture
at a university in England. This has obviously given him key knowhow within the
field of product development and manufacturing.
The right contactsA
brilliant idea is one thing, financing and production is something else. But
when you have a passion for something there’s always a solution. Lars began
looking for investors for his project and through a number of coincidences
brought him to Deloitte and Touche Corporate Finance in Southampton, England.
They were so convinced of his idea that they assisted him in writing a business
plan and soon Lars was negotiating with some of the largest companies in the
bicycle business. The future was looking bright, literally! But then, as it
happens all too often with good ideas, it was bought and filed away on
strategic grounds. However, that wasn’t much help to Lars, he wanted to see his
idea on the market.
Patents and provisionsA brilliant idea can quickly get buried in
legalities and economics. In principle, Lars owned the rights to his own
product but the company that had bought the rights but never actually
produced it objected. Lars spent the next five years fighting to keep his
patents in place while taking on a number of different jobs that had nothing to
do with design. He always kept a prototype of Citylite in his pocket so that he
could remind himself why he was there at times of despair.
Back on his bike and on the road againA couple of years ago Lars succeeded in finally
getting his project back on track with a new and ultimate version called
Citylite. Finally the world’s most compact set of bicycle lights will soon be
lighting the way for cyclists in cities all over the world. 
It has been a dream for many years but having
overcome a number of challenges along the way it began to be a reality again
from 2010 and in this connection Lars would like to say thank you to those
people who have shown their belief in him and have been willing to support and
assist him in realizing his dream come true without any promise of an immediate
return. Their support and effort has made all the difference.The Unending War of Vehicles VS. BicyclistsThroughout most of the world, cops on the scene of accidents immediately and invariably, assume
the cyclist is at fault! Bicycle riders have reason to fear for their lives. In
America, The New York Times, in a study of accidents involving a bicycle
and a vehicle, asked “Is it O.K. to Kill Cyclists?” Google “cyclist + accident”
and you will find that cops on the scene of accidents immediately and
invariably, assume the cyclist is at fault! 
Bicycle
riders have reason to fear for their lives. 
The Need For Bicycle Lighting So You Can See - And Be Seen! For
whatever reason, this proven antipathy against bicycle riders by drivers become
even more perilous in the dark streets of metropolitan areas, especially noted
and reported in New York City since the implementation of their CityBike
program. No doubt some of the conflict is caused by bicyclists disregarding
traffic laws, but there is a distinct, almost criminal disregard by government
to greatly improve bicycle safety by making it mandatory for bicyclists to have
a proper lighting system when riding at night.

A closer look at the perksThe Citylite Team
Citylite is a truly international team of
individuals. Founded in Denmark, our team includes experts in different fields
incl. low-energy circuitry, light and optics, tool making, ultra-sonic welding,
located in the Germany, Holland, Ireland, United Kingdom and the United States.
Over the years, our team has worked for
world-class companies, including HP, Duracell, Samsung, Sony, Procter &
Gamble to name just a few. A testimony to the team’s knowhow and abilities. Our
team has more than 30 years of experience with consumer product design.
Each team member has a real passion for Citylite
and we obviously all enjoy riding our bikes.Project Status

To produce Citylite I have
set up production in Denmark so that I can have full control with the
manufacturing process and the quality. Therefore I can proudly say that
Citylite is Danish design, engineered, manufactured and assembled in Denmark.
I have successfully completed my pilot run and proved the manufacturing process and I can therefore
confidently say that it can be done, that I can do it and that your funds will
not be wasted.
Because new product development
and mass manufacture is a risky business during the early stages, spending your money before having proved that it
can actually be made into a real product, would not be fair. Therefore I have
already developed and covered the costs of the initial soft tooling required to
prove the design and the ability to manufacture and assemble the product successfully. I developed the initial injection molds in aluminum because this material is
considerably cheaper than fully hardened steel that is needed for mass
manufacture. The downside is that the aluminum molds can only make a limited
number of lights before losing their tolerances. 
What you see in the pictures
are actual injection molded samples, not prototypes made from 3D printing –
this is the real thing!I am now ready to confidently deliver Citylites to you and as soon as I meet the Indiegogo funding goal I will start production of the exclusive
limited editions for all of you.
Funding Budget
I have been working on this Ying & Yang design concept for many years
now, but to make Citylite available for everyone around the world at a
reasonable price, I need to go into mass production. Citylite is now finally
ready and I am therefore seeking to crowd source demand upfront through
Indiegogo.
Your contribution will help fund:

Full hardened steel
     production tooling for mass manufacture
Development of a USB
     chargeable version
Large component orders
Global approvals
Research into different
     surfaces and materials
Ultrasonic welding horn in
     Titanium
Development of Organic
     pulsing pattern for the flashing modes
And the winner is... Citylite
During the last 14 months Citylite has been recognized and validated by
design and industry experts around the world - Proof of concept and a testimony
to its functionality, performance and high design quality.
All together Citylite has won 7 international design and innovation
competitions during the last 24 months and has in this connection been
evaluated by more than 250 independent jury members from 58 different
countries made up of internationally renowned designers, entrepreneurs and
academics.
iF Product Design Gold Award 2013 – also known as
the Design Oscar - Best of the Best
""With this product, there are many things that come together here that
work really well. It addresses an important safety topic and offers bicyclists
a novel solution. It is so intelligent that the light comes on automatically
and it remembers the users preferred switch mode i.e. on a constant or flashing
setting. It knows you are using it so it does what you expect it to do. It
immediately explains its function. So many things in design are used beautifully
in a single product that I think functionality design-wise absolutely surprised

<p>We have been refining our production prototype since the concept was first conceived 2 years ago.  We have tested the prototypes on over 170 riders ranging in age from 16 to 74 (see our Facebook fan page for the Test Riders gallery <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ReveloBikes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Revel Bikes""><strong>https://www.facebook.com/ReveloElectric</strong></a>).  Everyone was able to ride successfully on their very first try.</p>
<p>The design intent of the LIFEbike was to make it easy to maintain, easy to ride, great looking, lightweight, strong, safe, and contain common parts that are easy to replace. From our prototypes, we have completed our first manufacturing 3D model and have located a bike manufacturer in Canada to work with us.  </p>
<p>The first prototypes were hand-built by Henry and we look forward to putting the first manufactured prototypes through rigorous testing this summer.</p>

<p><em>From Henry:</em></p>
<p>My passion lies within the intersection of human interaction, mobility systems and urban development.  With the emergence of the electric bike technology, I became a strong proponent of electric bikes as an immediately available, green and sustainable transportation option, especially for urban environments.</p>
<p>After a 20-year career in Information Technology, I decided to pursue my true passion to become an Industrial Designer and completed my degree from OCADU in 2011.  As a 35-year bicycle enthusiast and urban commuter, I focused my thesis project on the transportation needs of the urban commuter and created the LIFEbike. </p>
<p>Realizing how empowering LIFEbike can be for so many, I founded Revelo Bikes Inc. in 2012 with a mission to create innovative, fun and highly usable personal electric vehicles that inspire and empower others to live life more fully. </p>
<p>As a child immigrant to Canada, I am especially proud to present the LIFEbike as a designed-in-Canada solution and can’t wait to watch it revolutionize urban commuting around the world.</p>
<p>Revelo Bikes Inc. is a new Canadian company dedicated to revolutionizing personal transportation and we have received generous support from MaRS, OCE, OCADU, and Venture Start to help guide us through our development.</p>

We have been refining our production prototype since the concept was first conceived 2 years ago.  We have tested the prototypes on over 170 riders ranging in age from 16 to 74 (see our Facebook fan page for the Test Riders gallery https://www.facebook.com/ReveloElectric).  Everyone was able to ride successfully on their very first try.
The design intent of the LIFEbike was to make it easy to maintain, easy to ride, great looking, lightweight, strong, safe, and contain common parts that are easy to replace. From our prototypes, we have completed our first manufacturing 3D model and have located a bike manufacturer in Canada to work with us.  
The first prototypes were hand-built by Henry and we look forward to putting the first manufactured prototypes through rigorous testing this summer.
The costs to get us to production are extensive and this is where we need your help. We are aiming to get the first limited edition LIFEbikes out this September.
Whenever Henry rides the LIFEbike, people always stop him and ask, ""That's cool! Where can I get one?"" With your help, we can complete the testing of our final prototypes and get them in the hands of happy riders like you very soon!

We are a team with a mission to revolutionize personal transportation with clean and efficient electric transportation alternatives that give people more fun and freedom.  We hope game changing designs like our LIFEbike will encourage more people to adopt greener modes of transportation, thus helping relieve our cities of congestion and empowering them to better explore and connect with their surroundings.

From Henry:
My passion lies within the intersection of human interaction, mobility systems and urban development.  With the emergence of the electric bike technology, I became a strong proponent of electric bikes as an immediately available, green and sustainable transportation option, especially for urban environments.
After a 20-year career in Information Technology, I decided to pursue my true passion to become an Industrial Designer and completed my degree from OCADU in 2011.  As a 35-year bicycle enthusiast and urban commuter, I focused my thesis project on the transportation needs of the urban commuter and created the LIFEbike. 
Realizing how empowering LIFEbike can be for so many, I founded Revelo Bikes Inc. in 2012 with a mission to create innovative, fun and highly usable personal electric vehicles that inspire and empower others to live life more fully. 
As a child immigrant to Canada, I am especially proud to present the LIFEbike as a designed-in-Canada solution and can’t wait to watch it revolutionize urban commuting around the world.
Revelo Bikes Inc. is a new Canadian company dedicated to revolutionizing personal transportation and we have received generous support from MaRS, OCE, OCADU, and Venture Start to help guide us through our development.

 

For all our supporters, we would like to engage you for your input as we further develop the LIFEbike.  We’ve already received enquiries and interest for the LIFEbike from around the world and for all types of use. We’ve been asked by major academic and industrial campuses to offer the LIFEbike as a campus bike; we’ve been asked by seniors who see this as a manageable, trusted, personal transportation companion; busy families see this as an affordable ""2nd car;"" others with mobility and balance concerns have suggested a tricycle version of the LIFEbike. 
With your contribution, we invite you to add your voice to this conversation as there is much impact that the LIFEbike can make, to lives, to communities, and to cities. 
Together, we can help reduce congestion, encourage the use of a greener form of transportation, and empower individuals by providing greater personal mobility.
""Gas prices continue to rise and people are looking for alternative methods of transportation.  The world continues to become a green, sustainable society and the LIFEbike is a perfect fit -  The Crowdfund Mafia ""
Thank you!

<p>Electricity is an essential
part of our lives which we cannot do without. Usually the source is from the
grid! But what if there is a grid failure? Or no grid at all? There are many
alternatives, from renewable sources such as sun and wind but MOST COMMONLY ,
used in 99% cases, is a GENERATOR.</p>

<h4><b>P-Gen working principle.</b></h4>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F5PxPPmn5NLA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5PxPPmn5NLA&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F5PxPPmn5NLA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>The basic principle, is that
engine runs at full efficiency, which is at full power, and all the generated
energy is stored in the Lithium battery. From there, DC current is converted by
Inverter to AC current 110/230V.  Current is always present and stored
energy used only as much as it is needed. Therefore, absolutely no fuel is
wasted when there is low or no load at all, and we achieve nearly 100% fuel to electricity
efficiency.</p>
<p>Due to a nature of electricity
consumption, electrical appliances demand current at different rate. For
example a washing machine, when it is in Stand-By consumes very little current,
when it heats up water inside it might consume up to 5 kW but only for a short
period of time, and in the working cycle it might demand from 0,2 to 1kW.</p>
<p>The Generator must maintain
maximum current otherwise it will stall and to do this it uses fuel, which is
being wasted as heat and exhaust. Rarely are you using all your devices at
once. The normal overall load is about 0,1-0,3 kW, which is equivalent to a
working TV, internet router and some lighting. Only when you prepare food, do
your laundry or Hoover the house, the load is about 1-5 kW, but still for short
periods of time 10-15 min, the rest of the time it is not more than 0,5 kW.
Which means you need all generator's power for not more than 1 hour a day, the
rest of the time you don't.</p>
<p>P-Gen ELIMINATES fuel consumption on the low load, which will save about 90% of the fuel, providing electricity 24/7 for household needs.  </p>

<p>We at <a href=""http://pgen.pluspower.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pluspower</a> team of dedicated engineers, specializing in cutting edge power
electronics and innovative solutions for energy efficiency. We are full cycle
engineering company, where we design our systems from physics and materials, to
circuit boards and high/low level software. Our specialty is AC/DC and DC/AC
converters, Lithium battery management systems (BMS), including large voltage
and large capacity industrial batteries assembly and controllers which manage
converters and BMS. We have over 10 patents on generator optimization systems
and high frequency planar transformers, which allow us to build high
power converters about 1/5 size of what available on the market, with
efficiency of 97%-98%. </p>
<p>Mostly, we do large optimization systems for villages which live off
diesel generators. There are many isolated settlements in Siberia with about
100-300 inhabitants, where local ""GRID"" is powered by generator. Our
systems reduce the amount of consumed fuel by about 2 times
in the winter, the period of very high load, and  about 10 times in the summer.</p>
<p>When we have finished developing our latest and smallest version of 5 kW
inverter (DC/AC converter), we thought, why cannot our technology be used on a
small scale basis? There are millions of people out there, who don't have any
electricity at all, or have suffered from natural disasters or just want to
have cottage in the middle of nowhere. Why can't they have proper permanent
supply of electricity, which would not consume much fuel and electricity cost
would be not much more than off the grid, or even cheaper?</p>
</div>
<h4>What we need?</h4>
<p>We have finished developing all the ""difficult"" parts of the system: automatic engine control, permanent magnet alternator, active rectifier,  solid 70V 20Ah lithium battery, BMS for that battery, 5 kW inverter and controller with TFT display to manage all that.</p>
<p>The product contains some
expensive parts, the inverter, Lithium battery, alternator, and engine. We are
engineering and development company and we outsource our production. To obtain
cost effective individually made parts, we must:</p>

<h3>Global impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We are not just
raising money for the commercial implementation of a good engineering idea but
providing a much needed product with global demand.</p>
<p>Take a look at <a href=""https://maps.google.com/gallery/details?id=z4f-ZuCLmiKg.kJJhjWiuu4X4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Earth at night Google maps</a> . What do you see? Some would
say ""light pollution"", well in some large cities this might be the
case. However, from the electrification point of view, it would be clear, that
only about 20% of the world has direct access to centralized electric grid. </p>
<p>In
South America, Africa, the Near and Middle East where there have been and are
wars the infrastructure is totally destroyed. These are highly populated areas
where people don't have a constant source of electricity. Additionally, where
there natural disasters hundreds of thousands of people are left without
electricity and homes.</p>
<p>There a many fund raising
campaigns, where people gather money for humanitarian causes, like health,
education, natural disaster aid. How is it possible to educate children for
example, when you have electricity for only an hour or two a day? Or what kind
of health aid there could be, if people simple don't have fridges or coolers to
store medicine?</p>
<p>We are great believers in alternative power, we <span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">have </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">even</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> added solar panels connection to P-Gen. But for now, the most accessible source of energy is Gasoline, and people use  it to make electricity. In a portable generator market 97% is made up of petrol driven
generators. As this is the most popular source of portable electricity today, why not make it cheap,efficient and more ecological?</span></p>
<p>Every year about 15 million
portable generator sets sold worldwide. All this adds to pollution and other
sorts of ecological consequences, like engine oil spills. Let's make our
contribution, and bring more efficient and cheap electricity, where it is now
needed and while we wait for new sources of electric energy become worldwide
available.</p>

<h3>Questions &amp; Answers</h3>
<p><b>Q: What type of load can I connect to P-Gen</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A: Any type of load could be connected, provide it's starting currents are not higher 7000VA, which is nearly all household appliances.</span></p>
<p><b>Q: How much gasoline it will use, if i use it 24/7 for my house.</b></p>
<p>A: From our statistics, we know that on average, household consumes about 6-9 kWhours a day. Provided that power of engine is 3kW, it will work for about 1-3 hours a day, Which is about 1-3 liter of gasoline. BUT, if you use less electricity, the amount of gasoline consumed will be less accordingly.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can I connect to P-Gen some sensitive equipment like computers, TV,       Hi-End music equipment etc.</b></p>
<p>A: YES. P-Gen generates absolutely <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">sinusoidal voltage, with nearly absence of any distortions. The quality of generated electricity exceeds the quality you get off the grid, therefore any sensitive electronics could be powered.</span></p>
<p><b>Q: Can I use it for commercial purposes? To power my shop for example.</b></p>
<p>A: If your commercial consumer, will consume within 12  kWhours of electricity a day, then it is no problem. This product designed for household usage, and it is not intended for commercial consumers. <b>BUT</b>, you can parallel few P-Gens to increase total output, and daily electricity consumption.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can I leave P-Gen working unattended for long time?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes, you can. If total electricity consumption over long period of time, within the capacity of tank, which is 25 liters, or about 83 kWhours. If P-Gen runs out of gasoline, it will automatically switch off. </p>
<p><b>Q: Is there a remote control possibility?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes, if you have Wi-Fi,  the remote control and monitoring is possible, where you can keep track of it's current state. If you don't have Wi-Fi Internet, there is a 3G modem option, which reveals full remote administration potential, indeed with mobile networks present. A convenient iOS, Android and Windows, monitoring software will be available.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: How do I control P-Gen remotely?</b></p>
<p>A: There are 3 way to do it. 1) you make P-Gen a hotpoint, and connect to it directly via Wi-Fi. 2) P-Gen connects to your Wi-Fi router and you connect to it via Internet/Intranet. 3) Using a 3G module, you can connect to it via mobile Internet. Though you must have a separate SIM card for P-Gen. P-Gen has a 128bit encryption and proprietary communication protocol, which will secure your save connection.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is there any additional control functions of P-Gen</b><br/></p>
<p>A: Yes. Scheduler will allow to set precise time when P-Gen outputs power, so you can plan any remote powering strategy. With installation of UPS module, you can plan when and how much energy must be consumed from the grind,  when to charge and discharge battery, and presence of solar module will expand scheduling possibilities even further. We will provide a full update on the new features.<br/></p>
<p><b>Q: Can I use it as UPS?</b></p>
<p>A: YES. With addition of UPS module (will retail for about 700USD), P-Gen will become On-Line 5kVA UPS. You don't need ATS or anything else. While grid is present, electricity will be supplied from there, when grid goes down, engine will be used to power your needs.</p>
<p><b>Q: I would like to use photo-voltaic solar panels to reduce fuel consumption.</b></p>
<p>A: With addition of MPPT solar module (will retail for about 400 USD), which fits inside the enclosure, You can connect up to 4 X 300W photo-voltaic panels. P-Gen has built in 1,2kWh Lithium battery, and inverter. System will preliminary use the energy from panels, and switching engine only in case of solar power shortage. If you live in sunny region, an additional battery could be installed (also fits inside), to increase solar energy storage.<br/></p>
<p><b>Q: How save is P-Gen?</b></p>
<p>A: P-Gen absolutely safe. All parts are manufactured from nonflammable materials. There are several internal fuses to protect battery from short circuit. Lithium battery is equipped with sophisticated active battery management system, which prevents it from overcharging. Battery does not burn, explode, produce Hydrogen or any harmful gases. Output has full galvanic isolation, therefore it could be earthed and RCD installed at consumer side for additional safety. At the end of lifetime it could be utilised as standard electronics. LiFePo4 battery does not require special utilisation as it is a household class rubbish.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: How do I maintain it?</b></p>
<p>A: P-Gen will inform you when and what to do. Usually it will be filter and oil change, which is not a big trouble. There are no serviceable parts inside except engine. Used engine will be a mass market engine from one of the popular and reliable manufacturers. Therefore you can service it in any motor shop. Although all P-Gens will undergo stress tests, if it fails in the warranty period, and the problem could not be solved though our resolution center, we will ship new spare parts or generator itself. And indeed we will work for internations partnership with servece centers for a better convenience of our customers.</p>

</div></div>","A new portable generator set that is very efficient, provides a constant source of
electricity and consumes 10 times less fuel!
Electricity is an essential
part of our lives which we cannot do without. Usually the source is from the
grid! But what if there is a grid failure? Or no grid at all? There are many
alternatives, from renewable sources such as sun and wind but MOST COMMONLY ,
used in 99% cases, is a GENERATOR.

Are there any
enhancements possible to a Generator? YES, and quite dramatic! 








P-Gen is used as a
constant source of electricity, no matter for what purpose. As a backup, or
autonomous power supply, you will always have needed electricity at the lowest
cost which is possible to achieve from a generator - even cheaper than
from stationary big diesel generators, and sometimes the grid. Now you can
power anything on the 24/7 basis, and do not worry about fuel, or generator
maintenance. And if little electricity used - little gasoline consumed, no matter over what period of time.









А perk example


HOW MUCH IT WILL COST?
Normally it would retail for about 2000 USD.  But for the purpose of fundraising, we will ship it at a discounted price of 1450 USD  including international shipping (All additional taxation and local charges apply). The supplied version will include generator according to it's specifications. Additional features such as WiFi monitoring and UPS expansion will be included in 2000 USD perk and above. A WiFI and UPS features, could be purchased separately for about $100 and $700 accordingly. A 3G and MPPT solar controller will be available when we reach stretch goals. And if we don't reach stretch goals, they still will be available but with delay of about 6 months.

P-Gen working principle.

The basic principle, is that
engine runs at full efficiency, which is at full power, and all the generated
energy is stored in the Lithium battery. From there, DC current is converted by
Inverter to AC current 110/230V.  Current is always present and stored
energy used only as much as it is needed. Therefore, absolutely no fuel is
wasted when there is low or no load at all, and we achieve nearly 100% fuel to electricity
efficiency.
Due to a nature of electricity
consumption, electrical appliances demand current at different rate. For
example a washing machine, when it is in Stand-By consumes very little current,
when it heats up water inside it might consume up to 5 kW but only for a short
period of time, and in the working cycle it might demand from 0,2 to 1kW.
The Generator must maintain
maximum current otherwise it will stall and to do this it uses fuel, which is
being wasted as heat and exhaust. Rarely are you using all your devices at
once. The normal overall load is about 0,1-0,3 kW, which is equivalent to a
working TV, internet router and some lighting. Only when you prepare food, do
your laundry or Hoover the house, the load is about 1-5 kW, but still for short
periods of time 10-15 min, the rest of the time it is not more than 0,5 kW.
Which means you need all generator's power for not more than 1 hour a day, the
rest of the time you don't.
P-Gen ELIMINATES fuel consumption on the low load, which will save about 90% of the fuel, providing electricity 24/7 for household needs.  
Who we are & What we need?


Who we are



We at Pluspower team of dedicated engineers, specializing in cutting edge power
electronics and innovative solutions for energy efficiency. We are full cycle
engineering company, where we design our systems from physics and materials, to
circuit boards and high/low level software. Our specialty is AC/DC and DC/AC
converters, Lithium battery management systems (BMS), including large voltage
and large capacity industrial batteries assembly and controllers which manage
converters and BMS. We have over 10 patents on generator optimization systems
and high frequency planar transformers, which allow us to build high
power converters about 1/5 size of what available on the market, with
efficiency of 97%-98%. 
Mostly, we do large optimization systems for villages which live off
diesel generators. There are many isolated settlements in Siberia with about
100-300 inhabitants, where local ""GRID"" is powered by generator. Our
systems reduce the amount of consumed fuel by about 2 times
in the winter, the period of very high load, and  about 10 times in the summer.
When we have finished developing our latest and smallest version of 5 kW
inverter (DC/AC converter), we thought, why cannot our technology be used on a
small scale basis? There are millions of people out there, who don't have any
electricity at all, or have suffered from natural disasters or just want to
have cottage in the middle of nowhere. Why can't they have proper permanent
supply of electricity, which would not consume much fuel and electricity cost
would be not much more than off the grid, or even cheaper?

What we need?
We have finished developing all the ""difficult"" parts of the system: automatic engine control, permanent magnet alternator, active rectifier,  solid 70V 20Ah lithium battery, BMS for that battery, 5 kW inverter and controller with TFT display to manage all that.
The product contains some
expensive parts, the inverter, Lithium battery, alternator, and engine. We are
engineering and development company and we outsource our production. To obtain
cost effective individually made parts, we must:




Pay for production line setup at manufacturer.


Place a quantity order to achieve a good price.



And that's where we need your help. If we get advance orders for the P-Gen, we will be able to make first mass series of it. And not just deliver it to our contributors, with this we can attract funding, establish production, and make P-Gen widely available.



Global impact

We are not just
raising money for the commercial implementation of a good engineering idea but
providing a much needed product with global demand.
Take a look at Earth at night Google maps . What do you see? Some would
say ""light pollution"", well in some large cities this might be the
case. However, from the electrification point of view, it would be clear, that
only about 20% of the world has direct access to centralized electric grid. 
In
South America, Africa, the Near and Middle East where there have been and are
wars the infrastructure is totally destroyed. These are highly populated areas
where people don't have a constant source of electricity. Additionally, where
there natural disasters hundreds of thousands of people are left without
electricity and homes.
There a many fund raising
campaigns, where people gather money for humanitarian causes, like health,
education, natural disaster aid. How is it possible to educate children for
example, when you have electricity for only an hour or two a day? Or what kind
of health aid there could be, if people simple don't have fridges or coolers to
store medicine?
We are great believers in alternative power, we  have even added solar panels connection to P-Gen. But for now, the most accessible source of energy is Gasoline, and people use  it to make electricity. In a portable generator market 97% is made up of petrol driven
generators. As this is the most popular source of portable electricity today, why not make it cheap,efficient and more ecological?
Every year about 15 million
portable generator sets sold worldwide. All this adds to pollution and other
sorts of ecological consequences, like engine oil spills. Let's make our
contribution, and bring more efficient and cheap electricity, where it is now
needed and while we wait for new sources of electric energy become worldwide
available.


Stretch Goals:




Risks & Challenges
 We have great experience in outsource production, as we have developed and manufactured our products for over 4 years now. We have established strong connections with some of the best (from our point of view) manufacturers in East Asia where main parts and electronics are manufactured.


Most of the electronic components we use, come from world leading manufacturers, such as STMicroelectronics, Cree, Infineon,  Magnetics, Kemet, United Chemi-Con etc. We aim at a world class product of the highest quality.

The key ingredient is the Lithium
LiFePo4 battery which is custom made in Russia. One of the biggest
industrial Lithium battery manufacturers in the World is a Russian
company Liotech.
In close collaboration with Liotech we have developed a custom 70V 20Ah
battery, which will be produced specially for P-Gen. We are technical developer
and producer of battery management systems (BMS) for their batteries.




  
Lithium battery prototype.
In our campaign, we are being realistic, and give terms in which we will definitely accomplish production and be able to ship P-Gen to our contributors.
We are professional engineering company, and always stand behind our words and promises. If we fail to ship P-Gen before August 2015, we will make a full refund (less commissions) to anyone who will ask for it and has contributed 1450 USD and above.
To keep you up to date, we will post at least 3 updates a week on our manufacturing progress and once a week new photos of developed parts, serial prototypes and software. Also we will answer all incoming questions, and post additional Q&A if they arise.
Other Ways You Can Help If you can contribute not with money but with an act, that will be valued. If you can spread the word, re-post or promote our campaign in any way, you are most welcome. This would be remunerated on a commercial basis, see our Referral Contest.

Questions & Answers
Q: What type of load can I connect to P-Gen
A: Any type of load could be connected, provide it's starting currents are not higher 7000VA, which is nearly all household appliances.
Q: How much gasoline it will use, if i use it 24/7 for my house.
A: From our statistics, we know that on average, household consumes about 6-9 kWhours a day. Provided that power of engine is 3kW, it will work for about 1-3 hours a day, Which is about 1-3 liter of gasoline. BUT, if you use less electricity, the amount of gasoline consumed will be less accordingly.
Q: Can I connect to P-Gen some sensitive equipment like computers, TV,       Hi-End music equipment etc.
A: YES. P-Gen generates absolutely sinusoidal voltage, with nearly absence of any distortions. The quality of generated electricity exceeds the quality you get off the grid, therefore any sensitive electronics could be powered.
Q: Can I use it for commercial purposes? To power my shop for example.
A: If your commercial consumer, will consume within 12  kWhours of electricity a day, then it is no problem. This product designed for household usage, and it is not intended for commercial consumers. BUT, you can parallel few P-Gens to increase total output, and daily electricity consumption.
Q: Can I leave P-Gen working unattended for long time?
A: Yes, you can. If total electricity consumption over long period of time, within the capacity of tank, which is 25 liters, or about 83 kWhours. If P-Gen runs out of gasoline, it will automatically switch off. 
Q: Is there a remote control possibility?
A: Yes, if you have Wi-Fi,  the remote control and monitoring is possible, where you can keep track of it's current state. If you don't have Wi-Fi Internet, there is a 3G modem option, which reveals full remote administration potential, indeed with mobile networks present. A convenient iOS, Android and Windows, monitoring software will be available.

Q: How do I control P-Gen remotely?
A: There are 3 way to do it. 1) you make P-Gen a hotpoint, and connect to it directly via Wi-Fi. 2) P-Gen connects to your Wi-Fi router and you connect to it via Internet/Intranet. 3) Using a 3G module, you can connect to it via mobile Internet. Though you must have a separate SIM card for P-Gen. P-Gen has a 128bit encryption and proprietary communication protocol, which will secure your save connection.
Q: Is there any additional control functions of P-Gen
A: Yes. Scheduler will allow to set precise time when P-Gen outputs power, so you can plan any remote powering strategy. With installation of UPS module, you can plan when and how much energy must be consumed from the grind,  when to charge and discharge battery, and presence of solar module will expand scheduling possibilities even further. We will provide a full update on the new features.
Q: Can I use it as UPS?
A: YES. With addition of UPS module (will retail for about 700USD), P-Gen will become On-Line 5kVA UPS. You don't need ATS or anything else. While grid is present, electricity will be supplied from there, when grid goes down, engine will be used to power your needs.
Q: I would like to use photo-voltaic solar panels to reduce fuel consumption.
A: With addition of MPPT solar module (will retail for about 400 USD), which fits inside the enclosure, You can connect up to 4 X 300W photo-voltaic panels. P-Gen has built in 1,2kWh Lithium battery, and inverter. System will preliminary use the energy from panels, and switching engine only in case of solar power shortage. If you live in sunny region, an additional battery could be installed (also fits inside), to increase solar energy storage.

As you can see, no profit will be made from this campaign - it is simply one aim to get the Yes Campaign noticed on the roads.  For donations over £1, such as £5, £10, £20 etc will get you up to 20 Car Stickers depending on how much you donate. If you wish to only receive a certain amount of car stickers which is less than the allocated from your donation, please let me know by either Commenting or Emailing me at youyesyetindy@gmail.com.The perks are simply a Car Sticker, which will come in a standard envelope addressed to the shipping address you provide us with.Even if we do not reach our goal, the campaign will still go ahead and you will receive your car sticker.  The ImpactImagine driving along the motorway and the car in front of you has a Yes Car Sticker, imagine going to the shopping centre and passing multiple cars in the car park with Yes Sticker... the impact from people seeing your sticker will be momentous. With less than 4 months to go, we can really the Yes message out there and show people that Scotland supports an Independent Scotland. This will not only be a good advert to Undecided/No's but a morale boost to fellow Yes voters, who will be delighted to see another supporter of the Yes campaign, you may even get chatting with each other about the campaign.So let's make it happen, we have 35 days to get 1000 Yes Stickers out into your own, friends and families car windows and advertise the message of Yes.Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you can't financially contribute to the ""1000 Car Stickers For Yes"" campaign, it doesn't mean you can't make a difference. Share us with your friends and family, via Yes Groups, Social Media sites and by using the IndieGogo Sharing tools... a share is just as good as a purchase! Once again, thanks for reading my pitch and I hope you will be able to contribute to the success of 1000 Car Stickers For Yes.Here's to a fantastic summer of Yes, and a win in September.Many Thanks,Rory Watson18.9 Indy Scot Radio & 1000 Car Stickers For Yes.",1.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>Together with FIBERTEK®, we developed proprietary methods and technologies to stack the T1000 military-grade carbon fiber. Every bike frame stacks 207 folded layers, which ultimately leads to a phenomenally light 1.2kg frame. It weighs in at a mere half of a normal bike, thanks to its carbon-fiber frame, front fork, and seat <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">post.</span></p>

<p>We knew the SpeedX frame just had to use single-piece technology for better stress distribution performance. Our efforts were rewarded with front-fork comfort that beats many of the world’s leading bike frames.We subject a new bike to nearly 300 production and testing processes, including stiffness testing on key frame parts to ensure the bike’s stiffness.</p>

</div></div>","Undistracted Pleasure. This is what SpeedX Leopard is all about. Riding is an activity that touches people’s mind. Riders want to be integrated with the bike, in each own rhythm, in fluency, without distraction. Leopard is ready to give the rider the ultimate road experience.






Built with aesthetics and performance in mind.The Leopard will surpass your every riding need: whether for intense training and competition or a Sunday spin with friends, it offers unparalleled comfort and enjoyment.
























Everything that the Smart Control replaces; lights, GPS & cycling computer.


More than a year ago we set ourselves an incredible mission. We wanted to combine carbon fiber and technology in a bike in an aerodynamic way like never done before. After 1560 sketches, 12 different prototypes and one year of our time we present you: The SpeedX Leopard.











Imagine a bike with a brain – taking care of everything except the cycling. That’s just what we made SpeedX Smart Control to do. It records your ride data and provides you with professional analysis in real-time with its built-in 2.4” inch screen. We designed XCoach specifically to prepare professional training courses – with interesting tasks and challenges, as well as global ranking tables.





RECORDS 12 TYPES OF CYCLING DATA 
Connect with SpeedX Smart Control with any ANT+ compatible device. Our bike has built-in sensors, we measure your performance based on the following 12 points:








 
800KM ULTRA-LONG BATTERY LIFE
With our innovative low-power GPS system our Smart Control can track and record your data for up to 800km or 40 hours. It only takes up to 30 minutes for a full charge. 















Together with FIBERTEK®, we developed proprietary methods and technologies to stack the T1000 military-grade carbon fiber. Every bike frame stacks 207 folded layers, which ultimately leads to a phenomenally light 1.2kg frame. It weighs in at a mere half of a normal bike, thanks to its carbon-fiber frame, front fork, and seat post.


We knew the SpeedX frame just had to use single-piece technology for better stress distribution performance. Our efforts were rewarded with front-fork comfort that beats many of the world’s leading bike frames.We subject a new bike to nearly 300 production and testing processes, including stiffness testing on key frame parts to ensure the bike’s stiffness.







We’ve improved both aesthetics and performance by cleverly hiding the brake cables in the front fork, reducing air resistance and maximising style. 






SpeedX is the third bicycle brand in the world to achieve full-integrated wiring. The other two bicycles with full-integrated wiring cost considerably more -  $5999 (TREK Madone 9.2) and $8200 (Specialized Venge Pro ViAS).


 






After more than eight months of prototyping the brakes, we found that the most aerodynamic way is putting the brakes behind the front fork.




We’ve hidden the brake behind the front fork, making it look more aerodynamic than ever.



We partnered together with design firm Frog to give Leopard a stylish, simple and daring look.








The Leopard boasts a simple, sleek look, matched only by the excellence of its riding experience. We thought long and hard about our choice of a race-ready SHIMANO 105 drivetrain, TRP fully internal brakes and a T1000 carbon fiber frame, front fork and seatpost.










The Leopard will surpass your every riding need: whether for intense training and competition or a Sunday spin with friends, it offers unparalleled comfort and enjoyment. 











We believe in our bike and you should too. We offer lifetime replacement warranty for the bikeframe. Ride in more comfort knowing that we that we have your back!










Every SpeedX customer enjoys a 7 days-no-questions-asked return and 30 days free exchange. Ride in even more comfort knowing that the SpeedX comes with a lifetime frame replacement guarantee.  











We’ve created a unique Smart Bike Fitting System to provide every rider with the best possible bike-fit. Just take a photo and upload it – the Smart Bike Fitting System will do the rest for you, automatically selecting the most suitable model, frame, handle bars and stem. Everything can be handled by the SpeedX Smart Bike Fitting System – no more worrying about which size is right for you.

<h1><strong>Intro</strong></h1>
<p>I am making a 39.75"" x 10"" longboard that folds up. As part of my project, I am also making a Quick Release Kingpin (see pic below).  So if it seems as though we are doing two products in one, We are! This board fits into all kinds of lockers, laptop backpacks, bear caves, and people's hearts with room to spare.  If our goal number seems low to you, we are not crazy.  Please read our goals section for the details.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""Board Folded Inside Locker"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/219/550/27ac9cac13baf29e980af883ff89fc6c_large.JPG?1350791010"" src="""" style=""""/>Board Folded Inside Locker</div>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> If you get this board, people will stop you to ask you about it.</p>
<h1><strong>Storytime</strong></h1>
<p>One day my brother that was visiting from California decided he wanted a board to ride on while at his college campus out in Ca. While, he loved the smoother ride of a longboard, he claimed he just had no where to stash it during class.  So, he got a frankenstein (shortboard w/ longboard wheels and trucks) instead.</p>
<p>In that moment, it became clear that while I love carrying my giant longboard into class, not eveyone does.  So, this board was designed for him.  He loved it. Then, I wanted to have one. I loved it. And now, I want to share it with everyone. You will love it.</p>
<h1><strong>Benefits</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Kingpin</strong></p>
<p>I have designed a fun quick release kingpin.  While these Quick Release Kingpins are an essential part of our Urban Sloop board, they are also quite handy on just about any board.  They are especially useful on mini cruisers 'cause they are often the difference that allows you to actually zip your backpack. </p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""Quick Release Kingpin"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/210/152/ca891fd3114e0913771404980d55ff0d_large.jpg?1350338108"" src="""" style=""""/>Quick Release Kingpin</div>
<p>  </p>
<p>1) STORAGE - Whether on Mini cruisers, Sloops, or just regular longboards, quick release kingpins allow riders to remove their hangers which makes storing boards easier.  </p>
<p>2) TENSION - Our specialized kingpins allow you to adjust the tension on your bushings anywhere without tools.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""Quick Release Specialized Kingpin"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/201/851/a6d05cd321f8563e163c8333b54ee104_large.JPG?1349904241"" src="""" style=""""/>Quick Release Specialized Kingpin</div>
<p>3) HANGER FLIP - When you don't need a tool, You can flip your hanger at any time.  </p>
<p>4) HANGER SWITCH - with hangers this easy to remove you can just take an extra set of hangers with a different length or wheel set-up around with you.  That way you can switch from hard sliding wheels to soft cruising wheels in a snap.</p>
<p><strong>Board</strong></p>
<p>It is important to remember that this board is meant to be a different kind of board.  This board is not simply a longboard that folds.  It is its own creature - with its own maneuvers and feel.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/219/509/7502809dc90f54303b5ffcb58c77fd60_large.JPG?1350788923"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>1) GREAT RIDE - People love the flex and the feel of this deck.  You can not get this kind of feel on a 1 piece deck and definitely not on a little plastic board.</p>
<p>2) SIZE MATTERS - This board can be stowed many places by folding it with the wheels still attached.  It can be stored almost anywhere (including most backpacks) when the wheels are removed.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/201/808/1e4338d9187fdf309f64a51ee59d3b01_large.jpg?1349903444"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>3) SECURITY - The number one reason that people I know used to ride longboards but then stopped, ""My board was stolen.""  Storing a board isn't just about convenience, it is about security too.</p>
<p>4) DIFFERENT MANEUVERS - You can do things on this deck that you can not on a 1 piece deck.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/201/812/0066e84b74c0ad25f12bf10f95b567e7_large.jpg?1349903562"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<h1><strong>Goal</strong></h1>
<p>My goal has always been to get at least 50 of these boards out to the public. To make it to this point, I have had to work in my backyard and, call in many favors from friends and family.  To make this project go to the next level, I need some support from everyone out there. Hopefully, through the miracle of indiegogo, we can do it. $5,000 Total is the initial goal.</p>

</div></div>","Intro
I am making a 39.75"" x 10"" longboard that folds up. As part of my project, I am also making a Quick Release Kingpin (see pic below).  So if it seems as though we are doing two products in one, We are! This board fits into all kinds of lockers, laptop backpacks, bear caves, and people's hearts with room to spare.  If our goal number seems low to you, we are not crazy.  Please read our goals section for the details.

Board Folded Inside Locker
WARNING: If you get this board, people will stop you to ask you about it.
Storytime
One day my brother that was visiting from California decided he wanted a board to ride on while at his college campus out in Ca. While, he loved the smoother ride of a longboard, he claimed he just had no where to stash it during class.  So, he got a frankenstein (shortboard w/ longboard wheels and trucks) instead.
In that moment, it became clear that while I love carrying my giant longboard into class, not eveyone does.  So, this board was designed for him.  He loved it. Then, I wanted to have one. I loved it. And now, I want to share it with everyone. You will love it.
Benefits
Kingpin
I have designed a fun quick release kingpin.  While these Quick Release Kingpins are an essential part of our Urban Sloop board, they are also quite handy on just about any board.  They are especially useful on mini cruisers 'cause they are often the difference that allows you to actually zip your backpack. 

Quick Release Kingpin
  
1) STORAGE - Whether on Mini cruisers, Sloops, or just regular longboards, quick release kingpins allow riders to remove their hangers which makes storing boards easier.  
2) TENSION - Our specialized kingpins allow you to adjust the tension on your bushings anywhere without tools.

Quick Release Specialized Kingpin
3) HANGER FLIP - When you don't need a tool, You can flip your hanger at any time.  
4) HANGER SWITCH - with hangers this easy to remove you can just take an extra set of hangers with a different length or wheel set-up around with you.  That way you can switch from hard sliding wheels to soft cruising wheels in a snap.
Board
It is important to remember that this board is meant to be a different kind of board.  This board is not simply a longboard that folds.  It is its own creature - with its own maneuvers and feel.

1) GREAT RIDE - People love the flex and the feel of this deck.  You can not get this kind of feel on a 1 piece deck and definitely not on a little plastic board.
2) SIZE MATTERS - This board can be stowed many places by folding it with the wheels still attached.  It can be stored almost anywhere (including most backpacks) when the wheels are removed.

3) SECURITY - The number one reason that people I know used to ride longboards but then stopped, ""My board was stolen.""  Storing a board isn't just about convenience, it is about security too.
4) DIFFERENT MANEUVERS - You can do things on this deck that you can not on a 1 piece deck.

Goal
My goal has always been to get at least 50 of these boards out to the public. To make it to this point, I have had to work in my backyard and, call in many favors from friends and family.  To make this project go to the next level, I need some support from everyone out there. Hopefully, through the miracle of indiegogo, we can do it. $5,000 Total is the initial goal.
Due to the timing of our project, we are dividing our fundraising efforts into two parts.  The first part will end on December 7th so that we can deliver our prototype backer benefits in time for the Holiday season.  Then, we will immediately repost the project to gather the remaining amount.

Bottom View
Stretch Goals
10K -All boards will have Indiegogo # laser etched on their board
20K -Aluminum support Plates become available
40K - Screws passing through metal plates will be countersunk
60K - Drop-thru model will become available
80K - Center Handle will be contoured to fit a hand
100K - Metal will be recessed to be flush with wood
120K - ???
By the stretch goals set, you can probably tell that we have some big plans in store for our board design.  While monetary goals are cool, the real goal here is to get some nasty boards to the people that want them.  The attainment of our stretch goals will be based on the total amount raised in both fundraising efforts.
 

Allocation of Funds
The majority of money will go towards parts and labor.  However, there are many other expenses to be considered.  Some of the money will go toward the costly patenting process.  Depending on the final number of backers, some money may need to go toward getting a new worksite.  If any funds are left over after those are covered, I would like to invest it in the website.
 
Note
The warning at the top is not a joke.  Whenever I ride my board, people ask me all kinds of questions.  So, if you get this board be prepared to talk to strangers.  Also not a joke - don't take their candy.

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Advanced resins bonding carbon fibers, formed in a high temperature and pressure mold. A detailed history on the materials can be found searching '<b>forged composites</b>' which is a trademark of the co-developers.   Used for defense projects and elite cars and clubs, this family of materials allows for extremely rapid production and the cost per pound is now economically viable.   In plain english.  We heat and squeeze high end materials, the part pops out in about 8 minutes.  Sanding, prep and paint.  <span><br/></span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">All forged carbon parts are made in the USA, mating parts are mixed CofO.</span><div><br/></div>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Axle options:<br/>1. Road<br/>2. Road disc, Mountain narrow<br/>3. Boost, Mountain wide<br/>4. Fat bike (these axles are not in stock today, but soon)</span></p>

<br/></span>Background:</h3>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Is there a market for reasonably light, reasonably priced carbon fiber cranks and stems? </b> Could this be a start of a new chapter, one where we can really pursue solving a pet peeve.  <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Better bikes for all shapes and sizes of people.   <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>If you are a six foot tall guy, you have a world of choices in this massive industry.  If you are shopping for a kid, short adult or even the elderly/others with physical limitations the choices are usually nothing, something exotic, or something that doesn't fit right.<span><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span><br/></span>Want to know more?  Head on over to our temporary website: </span><a href=""http://www.carbon.bike/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">www.carbon</a>.bike </p>
<br/>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></p>
<h3 style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The funding obviously pays for cost of goods.  It also gets things going with clear expectations for the backer and for us.  As of today,  320 cranks/stems  can be made a month. <span><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If there is a great response, we can deliver in an organized manner.  A waiting period for mating parts to manufacture and ship, and then domestic anodizing turn around. The pipeline was already tested.  That was important for us to make sure we could deliver.  We have raw part pictures on </span><a href=""www.facebook.com/usa.carbon"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Facebook</a><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">.</span></p>

<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">The Impact</span><br/></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Ideally, the impact will be an option for quality parts that are reasonably priced and represent a great value for the weight saved.</p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If (when!) this launch is successful, the other things we have ready are: Aluminum tubeless rims 28h, disc only for 20"", 24"", 26"" ready to manufacture off shore- <i>samples approved</i>.  An 11-38t extremely light Cassette for a sweet 1x10 drive train -<i>samples approved</i>.  We have started exploring seat post and bars, however, through axle 20"", 24"", 26"" mountain/folding/recumbent <b>disc </b>forks (ready to cut tools!) would be our next major in house focus. Then bike frames.<br/></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The ideal goal is bringing a 20"" bike to inter-bike.  If you are really serious about getting kids hooked, there is a real difference in having them ride a two wheeled rocket, or trying to keep up with a bike that weighs half their body weight.  We would cut 30% of the weight or more, and be only mildly more expensive than the current 'serious' (26lbs EEK!) offerings on the market.  <span><br/></span><br/>After that, 24"", 26"" and then we will reasses.  Forged carbon trike/ recumbent frames, hitch racks and more. The big companies not chasing the smaller markets is understandable, but there should be some lighter options.  The question is, can we provide those options and get the word out fast enough to make a real go at this.  Will there be demand for a blend of weight savings and pricing not currently offered? Indiegogo presented the best option to find out.</p>

<p>El peso ligero. Precio competitivo.</p>
<p>En el ciclismo, esta es una combinación verdaderamente inusual.</p>
<p>¿Cómo funciona Indiegogo:</p>
<p>Su tarjeta de crédito será debitada en el final de la campaña 12 de mayo de, el año 2016 21:59 PDT. Vamos a empezar a enviar los pedidos de inmediato, primero en llegar, primero en ser servido.</p>

<p>Qué estamos haciendo:</p>
<p>Bielas carbono forjado. Nuestros manivelas son un sólido forjado ""compuesto estructural"" por medio de la fibra de carbono cortada reforzado compuesto de moldeo de resina de éster vinílico.</p>
<p>Manivelas no son gloriosos, pero son importantes. La mayoría de los atajos para ahorrar dinero en las especificaciones de fábrica y construcción personalizada involucrar a la manivela. ""Barato"" y manivelas ""pesados"" se utilizan en bicicletas que cuestan varios miles de dólares. Más a menudo que no las bielas son forjadas de aluminio. Nos gusta la versión de carbono forjado mejor. Simplemente la fuerza de bielas de aluminio, a una densidad del material inferior.</p>
<p>Disponible en los siguientes longitudes:</p>
<p>140, 142.5, 145, 147.5</p>
<p>150, 152.5, 155, 157.5</p>

<p>El tallo más rápido del oeste. Un producto necesario para nuestros planes a largo plazo y un producto ideal para la fabricación de carbono forjado. Un vástago completa puede hacerse en minutos. Incluso aluminio forjado tallos por lo general requieren algún mecanizado secundario. Estamos bastante seguros de que hacemos la materia prima más rápida de la Parte, el tallo en el ciclismo. Actualmente disponible en 40mm, 50mm y 60mm.</p>
<p>Cómo se hace:</p>
<p>fibras de carbono resinas de unión avanzada, formados en una alta temperatura y la presión del molde. Una historia detallada de los materiales puede ser encontrado buscando 'composites' forjadas, que es una marca comercial de los co-desarrolladores. Se utiliza para proyectos de defensa y coches de élite y clubes, esta familia de productos permite la producción extremadamente rápido y el costo por libra ahora es económicamente viable. En la llanura Inglés. Calentamos y exprimir materiales de gama alta, la parte se sale en unos 8 minutos. Lijado, preparación y pintura.</p>
<p>Todas las piezas forjadas de carbono se hacen en los EE.UU., el apareamiento partes se mezclan C de O.</p>

<p>La atención a los detalles:</p>
<p>Tipo 3 anodizado de capa dura se utiliza en los platos de aluminio y se aplica en los EE.UU. para las piezas más largas, poniéndose podemos proporcionar. También se utiliza en las tazas y los ejes roscados BSA.</p>
<p>Toda la pintura usada en el carbono forjado proviene de la industria del arma de fuego. Extremadamente resistente y está disponible en muchos colores, nos pareció que era la mejor manera de terminar un gran producto.</p>
<p>Todos los insertos de rosca Actualmente acero inoxidable.</p>

<p>¿Hay un mercado para manivelas razonablemente ligero, fibra de carbono a precios razonables y tallos? Podría ser esto el comienzo de un nuevo capítulo, uno en el que realmente puede perseguir la solución de un motivo favorito.</p>
<p>Mejores bicicletas para todas las formas y tamaños de las personas.</p>
<p>Si usted es un hombre de seis pies de altura, tiene un mundo de opciones en esta industria masiva. Si usted está comprando para un niño, adulto o corta hasta los ancianos / otros con limitaciones físicas, las opciones son generalmente nada, algo exótico, o algo que no encaja bien.</p>
<p>¿Quiere saber más? Jefe de más a nuestra página web temporal: <a href=""http://www.carbon.bike"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.carbon.bike</a></p>
<p>Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes</p>
<p>La financiación obviamente paga por el costo de los bienes. También hace que funcione con las expectativas claras para el soporte y para nosotros. Al día de hoy, 320 manivelas / tallos se pueden hacer de un mes. </p>
<p>Si hay una gran respuesta, podemos entregar de una manera organizada. Un período de espera para las partes de acoplamiento a la fabricación y envío, y luego anodizado doméstica vuelta. La tubería ya fue probado. Eso era importante para nosotros para asegurarse de que podía ofrecer. Tenemos imágenes de piezas en bruto en Facebook.</p>
<p>El impacto</p>
<p>Idealmente, el impacto será una opción para la calidad de las piezas que tienen un precio razonable y representan un gran valor para el ahorro de peso.</p>
<p>If (! Cuando) este lanzamiento tiene éxito, las otras cosas que tenemos preparados son: 28h sin cámara de aire de aluminio llantas, discos sólo para 20 "", 24"", 26 ""listo para la fabricación de muestras playeros aprobó un casete 11-38t extremadamente ligero. 1x10 para un tren de transmisión dulce -samples aprobado.

<p>Después de eso, 24 "", 26"" y luego vamos a reasses. Triciclo forjado de carbono / marcos reclinadas, bastidores de enganche y más. Las grandes empresas no persiguen a los mercados más pequeños es comprensible, pero no debe haber algunas opciones más ligeras. La pregunta es, ¿podemos proporcionar esas opciones y correr la voz lo suficientemente rápido para hacer un intento real en esto. Habrá demanda de una mezcla de ahorro de peso y el precio no ofrece actualmente? Indiegogo presentó la mejor opción para averiguar.</p>

<p>Quello che stiamo facendo:</p>
<p>Manovelle carbonio forgiato. Le nostre manovelle sono un pieno forgiato ""composito strutturale"" utilizzando fibra di carbonio rinforzata tritato vinilestere resina composto di stampaggio.</p>
<p>Pedivelle non sono gloriosi, ma sono importanti. La maggior parte dei tasti di scelta rapida per risparmiare sulle specifiche di fabbrica e personalizzato costruisce coinvolgere la manovella. ""Economico"" e manovelle ""pesante"" sono utilizzati sulle moto che costano diverse migliaia di dollari. Il più delle volte queste manovelle sono forgiati in alluminio. Ci piace la versione in carbonio forgiato meglio. Semplicemente la forza di pedivelle in alluminio, con una densità di materiale inferiore.</p>
<p>Disponibile in queste lunghezze:</p>
<p>140, 142,5, 145, 147,5</p>
<p>150, 152.5, 155, 157.5</p>

<p>Lo stelo più veloce del west. Un prodotto necessario per i nostri piani a lungo termine e un prodotto ideale per la produzione di carbonio forgiato. Uno stelo completo può essere fatto in pochi minuti. Anche in alluminio forgiato steli di solito richiedono un po 'di lavorazione secondaria. Siamo abbastanza certi che facciamo il, materia prima più veloce a parte, stelo in bicicletta. Attualmente disponibile in 40 mm, 50 mm e 60 mm.</p>
<p>Come si fa:</p>
<p>fibre di carbonio avanzate resine leganti, formate in una temperatura elevata e muffa pressione. Una storia dettagliata sui materiali possono essere trovati cercando ""compositi forgiati ', che è un marchio di fabbrica dei co-sviluppatori. Utilizzato per progetti di difesa e auto d'elite e club, questa famiglia di materiali permette una produzione estremamente rapido e il costo per libbra è ora economicamente sostenibile. In parole povere. Noi calore e spremere materiali di fascia alta, la parte salta fuori in circa 8 minuti. Levigatura, preparazione e vernice.</p>
<p>Tutte le parti in carbonio forgiato sono realizzate in USA, accoppiamento parti sono mescolati COFO.</p>

<p>Tipo 3 duro cappotto anodizzazione viene utilizzato sulle corone in alluminio ed è applicato negli Stati Uniti per le parti più lungo che indossano possiamo fornire. E 'utilizzato anche sulle coppe e gli assi filettati BSA.</p>
<p>Tutta la vernice utilizzata sul carbonio forgiato viene dall'industria da fuoco. Estremamente resistente e disponibile in molti colori, ci siamo sentiti questo era il modo migliore per finire un grande prodotto.</p>
<p>Tutti gli inserti filettati sono attualmente in acciaio inox.</p>
<p>l'estrazione del bullone della manovella viene gestito con un anello interno, non un bullone secondo filettato.</p>
<p>Crankbolts produzione sono 10mm, nessun adattatore esadecimale necessario.</p>
<p>Installazione video verranno caricati durante il ritardo tra il momento finisce la campagna e il denaro viene trasferito a noi, che è di circa 15 giorni secondo IndieGoGo.</p>

<p>Se (! Quando) questo lancio ha successo, le altre cose che abbiamo pronti sono: alluminio tubeless cerchi in 28h, disco solo per 20 "", 24"", 26 "", pronti per la produzione off campioni shore- approvato un 11-38t Cassette estremamente leggero. per un dolce catena cinematica 1x10 -samples approvato. Abbiamo iniziato ad esplorare postale e barre di sicurezza, tuttavia, perno passante da 20 "", 24"", 26 ""/ pieghevole / forcelle dischi reclinate di montagna (pronto a tagliare gli strumenti!) sarebbe il nostro prossimo grande in casa messa a fuoco. Poi telai di bicicletta.</p>
<p>L'obiettivo ideale è portare un ""moto da 20 a tra-bike. Se siete veramente seri su come ottenere i bambini agganciati, c'è una vera differenza nell'avere loro giro di due razzo ruote, o cercando di tenere il passo con una moto che pesa la metà del loro il peso corporeo. avremmo taglio del 30% del peso o più, ed essere solo leggermente più costoso rispetto alla corrente 'grave' (EEK 26kg!) le offerte presenti sul mercato.</p>
<p>Dopo di che, 24 "", 26"" e poi ci reasses. trike forgiatura carbonio / telai reclinate, rastrelliere intoppo e altro ancora. Le grandi aziende non inseguono i mercati più piccoli è comprensibile, ma non ci dovrebbero essere alcune opzioni più leggere. La domanda è: possiamo fornire queste opzioni e ottenere la parola abbastanza veloce per fare un vero e proprio andare a questo. Ci sarà la domanda di una miscela di risparmio di peso e prezzi non sono attualmente offerto? Indiegogo presentato l'opzione migliore per scoprire.</p>

<p>Was machst du:</p>
<p>Geschmiedete Carbon-Kurbeln. Unsere Kurbeln sind eine solide geschmiedete ""strukturelle Verbund"" mit gehackter Kohlefaser Vinylesterharz-Formmasse verstärkt.</p>
<p>Kurbeln sind nicht herrlich, aber sie sind wichtig. Die meisten Abkürzungen Geld auf Werksdaten zu speichern und eigene Builds die Kurbel einzubeziehen. ""Billig"" und ""Heavy"" Kurbeln auf dem Fahrrad verwendet werden, mehrere tausend Dollar kosten. Mehr als oft nicht sind diese Kurbeln Aluminium geschmiedet. Wir mögen die geschmiedete Carbon-Version besser. Einfach die Festigkeit von Aluminium Kurbeln, bei einer niedrigeren Materialdichte.</p>
<p>Erhältlich in den Längen:</p>
<p>140, 142,5, 145, 147,5</p>

<p>Der schnellste Stamm im Westen. Ein notwendiges Produkt für unsere langfristigen Pläne und ein ideales Produkt für geschmiedetem Kohlenstoffherstellung. Eine komplette Stamm kann in wenigen Minuten durchgeführt werden. Auch aus geschmiedetem Aluminium in der Regel Stiele einige sekundäre Bearbeitung erfordern. Wir sind ziemlich sicher, dass wir das schnellste, Rohstoff machen im Radsport zu trennen, einzudämmen. Derzeit verfügbar in 40mm, 50mm und 60mm.</p>
<p>Wie es gemacht wird:</p>
<p>Erweiterte Harze Bindungs ​​Kohlefasern, in einer Hochtemperatur- und Hochdruckform ausgebildet ist. Eine ausführliche Geschichte über die Materialien können nach 'geschmiedete Composites' gefunden werden, die eine Marke der Co-Entwickler ist. Verwendet für Verteidigungsprojekte und Elite-Autos und Clubs erlaubt diese Familie von Materialien für extrem schnelle Produktion und die Kosten pro Pfund ist jetzt wirtschaftlich. In einfachem Englisch. Wir heizen und High-End-Materialien drücken, öffnet sich das Teil in ca. 8 Minuten aus. Schleifen, Vorbereitungs- und Farbe.</p>
<p>Alle geschmiedetem Kohlenstoffteile werden in den USA hergestellt Teile Paarung sind COFO gemischt.</p>

<p>Aufmerksamkeit auf die Details:</p>
<p>Typ 3 Hartbeschichtung Eloxieren wird auf den Aluminiumkettenblätter verwendet und ist in den USA für die längste Verschleißteile angewendet wir liefern können. Es wird auch auf die BSA Gewinde cups und Achsen verwendet.</p>
<p>Alle Farbe auf dem geschmiedeten Kohlenstoff verwendet wird, stammt aus der Firearm Industrie. Extrem robust und in vielen Farben erhältlich, fühlten wir uns dies der beste Weg, ein gutes Produkt zu erledigen war.</p>
<p>Alle Gewindeeinsätze sind derzeit Edelstahl.</p>
<p>Kurbelschraube Extraktion mit einem Innenring, nicht ein zweites Gewindebolzen behandelt.</p>
<p>Die Produktion Tretlager-Schrauben sind 10mm, kein Hex-Adapter benötigt.</p>

<p>4. Fat Fahrrad (diese Achsen sind heute nicht auf Lager, aber bald)</p>
<p>Passen Sie jeden Kettenblatt, die mit SRAM GXP kompatibel ist.</p>
<p>Wir arbeiten eng mit Ihnen zusammen, bevor Sie kurbeln den richtigen Sitz mit dem Fahrrad, um sicherzustellen, versenden. Es wird auch eine Option zu ""leihen"" Werkzeuge sein. Dies kann nicht durch Indiegogo behandelt werden, da eine Zahlung gesammelt werden, dann wieder einmal Werkzeuge zurückgegeben werden.

<p>Gibt es einen Markt für erstaunlich leicht, preiswerte Kohlefaser Kurbeln und Stiele? Könnte dies der Beginn eines neuen Kapitels sein, ein, wo wir ein Haustier ärgern Lösung wirklich verfolgen können.</p>
<p>Bessere Fahrräder für alle Formen und Größen von Menschen.</p>
<p>Wenn Sie ein sechs Meter großer Kerl sind, haben Sie eine Welt von Möglichkeiten in dieser massiven Industrie. Wenn Sie für ein Kind, kurz Erwachsenen oder sogar ältere / andere mit körperlichen Einschränkungen Einkaufen sind die Entscheidungen in der Regel nichts, etwas exotisch, oder etwas, das nicht richtig passen.</p>
<p>Wollen Sie mehr wissen? Leiter auf mehr als auf unserer temporären Website: <a href=""http://www.carbon.bike"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.carbon.bike</a></p>
<p>Was wir brauchen und was Sie erhalten</p>
<p>Die Finanzierung zahlt offensichtlich für Kosten von Waren. Es wird auch Dinge mit klaren Erwartungen für das backer und für uns geht. Ab heute können 320 Kurbeln / Stiele pro Monat vorgenommen werden. </p>
<p>Wenn es eine große Resonanz ist, können wir in einer organisierten Art und Weise liefern. Eine Wartezeit für die Paarung Teile herzustellen und Schiff, und dann Haus Eloxieren umdrehen. Die Pipeline wurde bereits getestet. Das war für uns wichtig, um sicherzustellen, dass wir liefern können. Wir haben Rohteil Bilder auf Facebook.</p>
<p>Der Aufprall</p>
<p>Idealerweise werden die Auswirkungen eine Option für hochwertige Teile sein, die preiswert sind und einen großen Wert für das Gewicht gespart darstellen.</p>
<p>Wenn (! Wenn) diese erfolgreich gestartet ist, sind die anderen Dinge, die wir haben bereit: Aluminium Tubeless-Felgen 28h, Scheibe nur für 20 "", 24"", 26 ""bereit Ufer- Proben genehmigt herzustellen off Ein 11-38t extrem leichte Cassette. für eine süße 1x10 Antriebsstrang -Proben zugelassen.

Dann Fahrradrahmen.</p>
<p>Das ideale Ziel bringt ein 20 ""Rad zu inter Fahrrad. Wenn Sie wirklich ernsthaft über Kinder bekommen süchtig, gibt es einen wirklichen Unterschied in mit ihnen zwei Rädern Rakete reiten, oder versuchen, mit dem Fahrrad zu halten, dass die Hälfte wiegt ihre Körpergewicht. Wir würden schneiden 30% des Gewichts oder mehr, und nur leicht teurer als die aktuelle ""schwerwiegend"" sein (26 £ EEK!) Angebote auf dem Markt.</p>
<p>Danach, 24 "", 26"" und dann werden wir reasses. Die geschmiedeten Kohlenstoff-Trike / Liegerahmen, hitch-Racks und mehr. Die großen Unternehmen, die nicht jagen die kleineren Märkte ist verständlich, aber es sollte einige leichtere Alternativen sein. Die Frage ist, können wir diese Optionen zur Verfügung stellen und das Wort aus schnell genug, um einen echten Sprung auf diese zu machen. Wird es für eine Mischung von Gewichtseinsparungen und Preis derzeit nicht angeboten gefragt sein? Indiegogo stellte die beste Option, um herauszufinden.</p>

<p>Ce que nous faisons:</p>
<p>Manivelles carbone forgé. Nos manivelles sont forgé ""composite structurel"" solide en utilisant la fibre de carbone hachées renforcé vinylester résine composé de moulage.</p>
<p>Manivelles ne sont pas glorieux, mais ils sont importants. La plupart des raccourcis pour économiser de l'argent sur les spécifications de l'usine et la coutume construit impliquent la manivelle. ""Cheap"" et manivelles ""lourds"" sont utilisés sur des vélos qui coûtent plusieurs milliers de dollars. Plus souvent qu'autrement, ces manivelles sont en aluminium forgé. Nous aimons la version en carbone forgé mieux. Il suffit de la force de manivelles en aluminium, à une densité inférieure matériau.</p>

<p>La tige la plus rapide dans l'ouest. Un produit nécessaire à nos plans à long terme et un produit idéal pour la fabrication de carbone forgé. Une tige complète peut être réalisée en quelques minutes. Même en aluminium forgé tiges nécessitent généralement des travaux d'usinage secondaire. Nous sommes à peu près certain que nous faisons le plus rapide, la matière première pour la pièce, de la tige dans le cyclisme. Actuellement disponible en 40mm, 50mm et 60mm.</p>
<p>Comment ça se fait:</p>
<p>des fibres de carbone des résines de liaison avancée, formés dans une haute température et moule de pression. Une histoire détaillée des matériaux peut être trouvé la recherche «composites forgés» qui est une marque de commerce des co-développeurs. Utilisé pour des projets de défense et les voitures d'élite et des clubs, cette famille de produits permet une production extrêmement rapide et le coût par livre est maintenant économiquement viable. En langage clair. Nous chauffons et presser des matériaux haut de gamme, la partie apparaît dans environ 8 minutes. Ponçage, préparation et de la peinture.</p>

<p>Toutes les peintures utilisées sur le carbone forgé provient de l'industrie des armes à feu. Extrêmement résistant et disponible en plusieurs couleurs, nous avons senti c'était la meilleure façon de terminer un excellent produit.</p>
<p>Tous les inserts filetés sont actuellement en acier inoxydable.</p>
<p>extraction de boulon de manivelle est manipulé avec un anneau interne, pas un second boulon fileté.</p>
<p>Crankbolts de production sont 10mm, aucun adaptateur hex nécessaire.</p>

The basics:The manufacturing cost of forging, the weight reduction of carbon fiber.  Light weight.  Competitive pricing.  In cycling, this is a truly unusual combination. 
What we are doing:Forged Carbon Cranks.  Our cranks are a solid forged ""structural composite""  using chopped carbon fiber reinforced Vinyl Ester resin molding compound. Cranks are not glorious, but they are important.  Most shortcuts to save money on factory specs and custom builds involve the crank.  ""Cheap"" and ""Heavy"" cranks are used on bikes costing several thousand dollars.  More often than not those cranks are forged aluminum. We like the forged carbon version better.  Simply the strength of aluminum cranks, at a lower material density.  Available in these lengths: 
140, 142.5, 145, 147.5150, 152.5, 155, 157.5160, 162.5, 165, 167.5170, 172.5, 175, 177.5


 



The fastest stem in the west.  A necessary product for our long term plans and an ideal product for forged carbon manufacturing.  A complete stem can be made in minutes.  Even forged aluminum stems usually require some secondary machining. We are fairly certain we make the fastest, raw material to part, stem in cycling. Currently available in 40mm, 50mm and 60mm.  
How it is done:
Advanced resins bonding carbon fibers, formed in a high temperature and pressure mold. A detailed history on the materials can be found searching 'forged composites' which is a trademark of the co-developers.   Used for defense projects and elite cars and clubs, this family of materials allows for extremely rapid production and the cost per pound is now economically viable.   In plain english.  We heat and squeeze high end materials, the part pops out in about 8 minutes.  Sanding, prep and paint.  All forged carbon parts are made in the USA, mating parts are mixed CofO.


Color accents require double processing of the most expensive labor step.Standard is all armored black.


Attention to the details:


Type 3 hard coat anodizing is used on the aluminum chainrings and is applied in the USA for the longest wearing parts we can provide.  It is also used on the BSA threaded cups and axles.

All paint used on the forged carbon comes from the Firearm industry.  Extremely tough and available in many colors, we felt this was the best way to finish off a great product.
All thread inserts are currently stainless steel.Crank bolt extraction is handled with an internal ring, not a second threaded bolt.Production Crankbolts are 10mm, no hex adapter needed.Installation videos will be loaded during the delay from the time the campaign ends and the money is transfered to us which is about 15 days according to indiegogo.





Weights:
Cranksets are weighed using a 156 Q axle, preload ring and spacers, with paint and screws.  Chainrings and bottom brackets are weighed seperately.140mm,  142.5mm,  145mm 365g; 147.5mm 375g;
150mm,  152.5mm,  155mm 385g;  157.5mm 395g;
160mm,  162.5mm,  165mm 415g;  167.5mm 425g;
170mm,  172.5mm,  175mm 435g;  177.5mm 445g;

Road 110BCD spider, forged carbon with stainless eyelets.  Chainrings not included.  Chainring Logo photoshop'd out.
A few more things on the cranksets:Will they fit your ______ bike?  Yes.  Unless you have something incredibly odd.Cranksets are sold as crank arms, your choice of length, and your choice of axle which will determine the Q-Factor.  Add a single ring or a spider for road double, mountain double or mountain triple.  Add the right bottom bracket or adapter.
Axle options:1. Road2. Road disc, Mountain narrow3. Boost, Mountain wide4. Fat bike (these axles are not in stock today, but soon)
Fit any chainring that is compatible with SRAM GXP.
We will work closely with you before your cranks ship to ensure a proper fit with your bike.  There will also be an option to 'borrow' tools.  This can't be handled through indiegogo, as a payment will be collected, then returned once tools are returned.  The cost to borrow all necessary bottom bracket tools is the price of return shipping.  This is only available with crank perk.
Watch facebook for real world weights in comparison pictures.




Background:
Is there a market for reasonably light, reasonably priced carbon fiber cranks and stems?  Could this be a start of a new chapter, one where we can really pursue solving a pet peeve.  Better bikes for all shapes and sizes of people.   If you are a six foot tall guy, you have a world of choices in this massive industry.  If you are shopping for a kid, short adult or even the elderly/others with physical limitations the choices are usually nothing, something exotic, or something that doesn't fit right.Want to know more?  Head on over to our temporary website: www.carbon.bike 


What We Need & What You Get
The funding obviously pays for cost of goods.  It also gets things going with clear expectations for the backer and for us.  As of today,  320 cranks/stems  can be made a month. If there is a great response, we can deliver in an organized manner.  A waiting period for mating parts to manufacture and ship, and then domestic anodizing turn around. The pipeline was already tested.  That was important for us to make sure we could deliver.  We have raw part pictures on Facebook.

The Impact
Ideally, the impact will be an option for quality parts that are reasonably priced and represent a great value for the weight saved.
If (when!) this launch is successful, the other things we have ready are: Aluminum tubeless rims 28h, disc only for 20"", 24"", 26"" ready to manufacture off shore- samples approved.  An 11-38t extremely light Cassette for a sweet 1x10 drive train -samples approved.  We have started exploring seat post and bars, however, through axle 20"", 24"", 26"" mountain/folding/recumbent disc forks (ready to cut tools!) would be our next major in house focus. Then bike frames.
The ideal goal is bringing a 20"" bike to inter-bike.  If you are really serious about getting kids hooked, there is a real difference in having them ride a two wheeled rocket, or trying to keep up with a bike that weighs half their body weight.  We would cut 30% of the weight or more, and be only mildly more expensive than the current 'serious' (26lbs EEK!) offerings on the market.  After that, 24"", 26"" and then we will reasses.  Forged carbon trike/ recumbent frames, hitch racks and more. The big companies not chasing the smaller markets is understandable, but there should be some lighter options.  The question is, can we provide those options and get the word out fast enough to make a real go at this.  Will there be demand for a blend of weight savings and pricing not currently offered? Indiegogo presented the best option to find out.



Other Ways You Can Help

Even if you are not in the market for cranks or stems, please share on Facebook etc Innovation and alternate solutions are never a bad thing.  Thank you!
P.S.


Raw wet part, after sanding and tumbling.  In order for the best paint bonding the parts are then roughed up.  A clear gelcoat might be nice, but it is not nearly the protection the firearm coating is and gel is 5 times heavier.  The look is unique for these types of materials.  
First generation 140mm Cranks, and the bike that started this journey. 34t Chainring.

Second generation cranks, we have full tooling on these.But we decided to relocate some weight,  shed about 20g per arm and change some aspects of the tooling for smoother manufacturing.  32t chainring.Third and final crank arms.  All tooling is finished, ready to produce.

50mm stem in use.  We are not selling the caps yet. We want to overmold the screw so it looks cleaner.

This bike is in the middle of an overhaul.  40mm stem bolted up.

Qué estamos haciendo:
Bielas carbono forjado. Nuestros manivelas son un sólido forjado ""compuesto estructural"" por medio de la fibra de carbono cortada reforzado compuesto de moldeo de resina de éster vinílico.
Manivelas no son gloriosos, pero son importantes. La mayoría de los atajos para ahorrar dinero en las especificaciones de fábrica y construcción personalizada involucrar a la manivela. ""Barato"" y manivelas ""pesados"" se utilizan en bicicletas que cuestan varios miles de dólares. Más a menudo que no las bielas son forjadas de aluminio. Nos gusta la versión de carbono forjado mejor. Simplemente la fuerza de bielas de aluminio, a una densidad del material inferior.
Disponible en los siguientes longitudes:
140, 142.5, 145, 147.5

El tallo más rápido del oeste. Un producto necesario para nuestros planes a largo plazo y un producto ideal para la fabricación de carbono forjado. Un vástago completa puede hacerse en minutos. Incluso aluminio forjado tallos por lo general requieren algún mecanizado secundario. Estamos bastante seguros de que hacemos la materia prima más rápida de la Parte, el tallo en el ciclismo. Actualmente disponible en 40mm, 50mm y 60mm.
Cómo se hace:
fibras de carbono resinas de unión avanzada, formados en una alta temperatura y la presión del molde. Una historia detallada de los materiales puede ser encontrado buscando 'composites' forjadas, que es una marca comercial de los co-desarrolladores. Se utiliza para proyectos de defensa y coches de élite y clubes, esta familia de productos permite la producción extremadamente rápido y el costo por libra ahora es económicamente viable. En la llanura Inglés. Calentamos y exprimir materiales de gama alta, la parte se sale en unos 8 minutos. Lijado, preparación y pintura.
Todas las piezas forjadas de carbono se hacen en los EE.UU., el apareamiento partes se mezclan C de O.


acentos de color requieren el doble de procesamiento de la etapa de la mano de obra más cara.
Estándar es todo negro blindado.
La atención a los detalles:
Tipo 3 anodizado de capa dura se utiliza en los platos de aluminio y se aplica en los EE.UU. para las piezas más largas, poniéndose podemos proporcionar. También se utiliza en las tazas y los ejes roscados BSA.
Toda la pintura usada en el carbono forjado proviene de la industria del arma de fuego. Extremadamente resistente y está disponible en muchos colores, nos pareció que era la mejor manera de terminar un gran producto.
Todos los insertos de rosca Actualmente acero inoxidable.
extracción de tornillo de la biela se maneja con un anillo interno, no un perno roscado segundo.
Crankbolts de producción son de 10 mm, sin adaptador hexagonal necesario.

Unas cuantas más cosas sobre las bielas:
Van a adaptarse a su ______ bicicleta? Sí. A menos que tenga algo increíblemente extraño.
Bielas se venden como brazos de manivela, su elección de longitud, y su elección de los ejes que van a determinar el Q-Factor. Añadir un solo anillo o una araña de doble carretera, montaña doble o el triple de montaña. Añadir el soporte inferior derecha o adaptador.
Opciones de ejes:
1. camino
2. disco de carretera, montaña estrecha
3. Impulso, amplia Montaña
4. bicicleta de grasa (estos ejes no están en la acción de hoy, pero pronto)
Adaptarse a cualquier plato que sea compatible con SRAM GXP.
Vamos a trabajar estrechamente con usted antes de que sus manivelas enviar a asegurar un ajuste apropiado con su bicicleta. También habrá una opción para las herramientas de ""tomar prestado"". Esto no puede ser manejado a través IndieGoGo, tal como se recoge un pago, y luego regresó una vez que se devuelven herramientas. El costo de pedir prestado todas las herramientas necesarias pedalier es el precio de envío de devolución. Esto sólo está disponible con el beneficio adicional de manivela.

Fondo:
¿Hay un mercado para manivelas razonablemente ligero, fibra de carbono a precios razonables y tallos? Podría ser esto el comienzo de un nuevo capítulo, uno en el que realmente puede perseguir la solución de un motivo favorito.
Mejores bicicletas para todas las formas y tamaños de las personas.
Si usted es un hombre de seis pies de altura, tiene un mundo de opciones en esta industria masiva. Si usted está comprando para un niño, adulto o corta hasta los ancianos / otros con limitaciones físicas, las opciones son generalmente nada, algo exótico, o algo que no encaja bien.
¿Quiere saber más? Jefe de más a nuestra página web temporal: www.carbon.bike
Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes
La financiación obviamente paga por el costo de los bienes. También hace que funcione con las expectativas claras para el soporte y para nosotros. Al día de hoy, 320 manivelas / tallos se pueden hacer de un mes. 
Si hay una gran respuesta, podemos entregar de una manera organizada. Un período de espera para las partes de acoplamiento a la fabricación y envío, y luego anodizado doméstica vuelta. La tubería ya fue probado. Eso era importante para nosotros para asegurarse de que podía ofrecer. Tenemos imágenes de piezas en bruto en Facebook.
El impacto
Idealmente, el impacto será una opción para la calidad de las piezas que tienen un precio razonable y representan un gran valor para el ahorro de peso.
If (! Cuando) este lanzamiento tiene éxito, las otras cosas que tenemos preparados son: 28h sin cámara de aire de aluminio llantas, discos sólo para 20 "", 24"", 26 ""listo para la fabricación de muestras playeros aprobó un casete 11-38t extremadamente ligero. 1x10 para un tren de transmisión dulce -samples aprobado. Hemos comenzado a explorar la tija del sillín y bares, sin embargo, a través del eje 20 "", 24"", 26 ""montaña / plegado / horquillas de disco yacentes (listo para cortar herramientas!) sería nuestro próximo gran en el enfoque casa. A continuación, cuadros de bicicleta.
El objetivo ideal está trayendo una ""bicicleta de 20 a inter-bicicleta. Si usted es realmente serio acerca de hacer que los niños enganchados, hay una diferencia real en disponer de ellos montan dos cohete con ruedas, o tratando de mantenerse al día con una moto que pesa la mitad de su peso corporal. Nos recorte del 30% del peso o más, y ser sólo ligeramente más caro que el actual ""grave"" (EEK 26 libras!) ofertas en el mercado.
Después de eso, 24 "", 26"" y luego vamos a reasses. Triciclo forjado de carbono / marcos reclinadas, bastidores de enganche y más. Las grandes empresas no persiguen a los mercados más pequeños es comprensible, pero no debe haber algunas opciones más ligeras. La pregunta es, ¿podemos proporcionar esas opciones y correr la voz lo suficientemente rápido para hacer un intento real en esto. Habrá demanda de una mezcla de ahorro de peso y el precio no ofrece actualmente? Indiegogo presentó la mejor opción para averiguar.
Puedes ayudar de otras formas
Incluso si usted no está en el mercado para manivelas o tallos, por favor, compartir en Facebook, etc.
Innovación y soluciones alternativas no son nunca una mala cosa. ¡Gracias!

Le basi:
Il costo di produzione di forgiatura, la riduzione del peso della fibra di carbonio.
Il peso leggero. Prezzi competitivi.
Nel ciclismo, si tratta di una combinazione davvero insolito.
Come Indiegogo funziona:
La carta di credito sarà addebitata al termine della campagna 12 mag 2016 21:59 PDT. Inizieremo ordini di spedizione subito, primo arrivato, primo servito.
Pagare una tassa di spedizione per manovelle più alcun movimento centrale e o corona.
Spedizione in tutto il mondo da DHL.

Quello che stiamo facendo:
Manovelle carbonio forgiato. Le nostre manovelle sono un pieno forgiato ""composito strutturale"" utilizzando fibra di carbonio rinforzata tritato vinilestere resina composto di stampaggio.
Pedivelle non sono gloriosi, ma sono importanti. La maggior parte dei tasti di scelta rapida per risparmiare sulle specifiche di fabbrica e personalizzato costruisce coinvolgere la manovella. ""Economico"" e manovelle ""pesante"" sono utilizzati sulle moto che costano diverse migliaia di dollari. Il più delle volte queste manovelle sono forgiati in alluminio. Ci piace la versione in carbonio forgiato meglio. Semplicemente la forza di pedivelle in alluminio, con una densità di materiale inferiore.
Disponibile in queste lunghezze:
140, 142,5, 145, 147,5
150, 152.5, 155, 157.5
160, 162,5, 165, 167,5
170, 172.5, 175, 177,5

Lo stelo più veloce del west. Un prodotto necessario per i nostri piani a lungo termine e un prodotto ideale per la produzione di carbonio forgiato. Uno stelo completo può essere fatto in pochi minuti. Anche in alluminio forgiato steli di solito richiedono un po 'di lavorazione secondaria. Siamo abbastanza certi che facciamo il, materia prima più veloce a parte, stelo in bicicletta. Attualmente disponibile in 40 mm, 50 mm e 60 mm.
Come si fa:
fibre di carbonio avanzate resine leganti, formate in una temperatura elevata e muffa pressione. Una storia dettagliata sui materiali possono essere trovati cercando ""compositi forgiati ', che è un marchio di fabbrica dei co-sviluppatori. Utilizzato per progetti di difesa e auto d'elite e club, questa famiglia di materiali permette una produzione estremamente rapido e il costo per libbra è ora economicamente sostenibile. In parole povere. Noi calore e spremere materiali di fascia alta, la parte salta fuori in circa 8 minuti. Levigatura, preparazione e vernice.
Tutte le parti in carbonio forgiato sono realizzate in USA, accoppiamento parti sono mescolati COFO.



accenti di colore richiedono doppia elaborazione del passo del lavoro più costoso.
Standard è tutto nero blindato.
L'attenzione ai dettagli:
Tipo 3 duro cappotto anodizzazione viene utilizzato sulle corone in alluminio ed è applicato negli Stati Uniti per le parti più lungo che indossano possiamo fornire. E 'utilizzato anche sulle coppe e gli assi filettati BSA.
Tutta la vernice utilizzata sul carbonio forgiato viene dall'industria da fuoco. Estremamente resistente e disponibile in molti colori, ci siamo sentiti questo era il modo migliore per finire un grande prodotto.
Tutti gli inserti filettati sono attualmente in acciaio inox.
l'estrazione del bullone della manovella viene gestito con un anello interno, non un bullone secondo filettato.
Crankbolts produzione sono 10mm, nessun adattatore esadecimale necessario.
Installazione video verranno caricati durante il ritardo tra il momento finisce la campagna e il denaro viene trasferito a noi, che è di circa 15 giorni secondo IndieGoGo.
pesi:
Guarniture vengono pesati con un 156 Q asse, anello di precarico e distanziali, con vernice e viti. Corone e movimenti centrali sono pesati separatamente.

Un paio di cose sulle guarniture:
Saranno in grado di misura il vostro ______ moto? Sì. Se non avete qualcosa di incredibilmente strano.
Guarniture sono venduti come pedivelle, la scelta di lunghezza, e la vostra scelta di asse che determineranno il Q-Factor. Aggiungere un singolo anello o un ragno per il doppio su strada, montagna doppia o tripla di montagna. Aggiungere la staffa in basso a destra o adattatore.
Opzioni asse:
1. Strada
2. disco Road, montagna stretta
3. Boost, Montagna larga
4. bicicletta Fat (questi assi non sono in azione oggi, ma ben presto)
Montare ogni corona che è compatibile con SRAM GXP.
Lavoreremo a stretto contatto con voi davanti ai vostri pedivelle nave per assicurare una misura adeguata con la bicicletta. Ci sarà anche la possibilità di prendere in prestito strumenti ''. Questo non può essere gestita tramite IndieGoGo, come un pagamento saranno raccolti, poi ritornò una volta gli strumenti vengono restituiti. Il costo di prendere in prestito tutti i necessari strumenti movimento centrale è il prezzo del trasporto di ritorno. Questo è disponibile solo con manovella vantaggio.

Guarda facebook per i pesi del mondo reale in immagini di confronto.


Sfondo:
Esiste un mercato per, pedivelle in fibra di carbonio a prezzi ragionevoli ragionevolmente leggeri e steli? Questo potrebbe essere un inizio di un nuovo capitolo, quello in cui possiamo realmente perseguire la soluzione di un piccolo cruccio.
Meglio biciclette per tutte le forme e dimensioni delle persone.
Se sei un ragazzo alto sei piedi, si ha un mondo di scelte in questo settore massiccia. Se siete di shopping per un bambino, adulto o breve anche gli anziani / altri con limitazioni fisiche le scelte sono di solito nulla, qualcosa di esotico, o qualcosa che non va bene a destra.
Voglio sapere di più? Capo su oltre al nostro sito temporaneo: www.carbon.bike
Quello che ci serve e che cosa ottenete
Il finanziamento paga ovviamente per il costo delle merci. Si ottiene anche le cose con chiare aspettative per il sostenitore e per noi. Ad oggi, 320 manovelle / steli possono essere fatte un mese. 
Se c'è una grande risposta, siamo in grado di consegnare in maniera organizzata. Un periodo di attesa per le parti di accoppiamento per la produzione e la nave, e poi anodizzazione interna girarsi. Il gasdotto è stato già testato. E 'stato importante per noi per assicurarsi che siamo riusciti a fornire. Abbiamo immagini crude parte su Facebook.
L'impatto
Idealmente, l'impatto sarà un'opzione per componenti di qualità che sono a prezzi ragionevoli e rappresentano un grande valore per il peso risparmiato.
Se (! Quando) questo lancio ha successo, le altre cose che abbiamo pronti sono: alluminio tubeless cerchi in 28h, disco solo per 20 "", 24"", 26 "", pronti per la produzione off campioni shore- approvato un 11-38t Cassette estremamente leggero. per un dolce catena cinematica 1x10 -samples approvato. Abbiamo iniziato ad esplorare postale e barre di sicurezza, tuttavia, perno passante da 20 "", 24"", 26 ""/ pieghevole / forcelle dischi reclinate di montagna (pronto a tagliare gli strumenti!) sarebbe il nostro prossimo grande in casa messa a fuoco. Poi telai di bicicletta.
L'obiettivo ideale è portare un ""moto da 20 a tra-bike. Se siete veramente seri su come ottenere i bambini agganciati, c'è una vera differenza nell'avere loro giro di due razzo ruote, o cercando di tenere il passo con una moto che pesa la metà del loro il peso corporeo. avremmo taglio del 30% del peso o più, ed essere solo leggermente più costoso rispetto alla corrente 'grave' (EEK 26kg!) le offerte presenti sul mercato.
Dopo di che, 24 "", 26"" e poi ci reasses. trike forgiatura carbonio / telai reclinate, rastrelliere intoppo e altro ancora. Le grandi aziende non inseguono i mercati più piccoli è comprensibile, ma non ci dovrebbero essere alcune opzioni più leggere. La domanda è: possiamo fornire queste opzioni e ottenere la parola abbastanza veloce per fare un vero e proprio andare a questo. Ci sarà la domanda di una miscela di risparmio di peso e prezzi non sono attualmente offerto? Indiegogo presentato l'opzione migliore per scoprire.
Altri modi per aiutare
Anche se non siete nel mercato per manovelle o gambi, si prega di condividere su Facebook, ecc
L'innovazione e soluzioni alternative non sono mai una cosa negativa. Grazie!

Die Grundlagen:
Die Herstellungskosten des Schmiedens, der Gewichtsreduzierung von Kohlefaser.
Geringes Gewicht. Wettbewerbsfähige Preisanpassung.
Beim Radfahren ist dies eine wirklich ungewöhnliche Kombination.
Wie Indiegogo funktioniert:
Ihre Kreditkarte wird am Ende der Kampagne 12. Mai 2016 21.59 Uhr PDT berechnet. Wir werden Versandaufträge sofort, wer zuerst kommt, mahlt zuerst beginnen.
Pay ein Lieferkosten für Kurbeln zuzüglich Tretlager und oder Kettenblatt.
Versand weltweit durch DHL.

Was machst du:
Geschmiedete Carbon-Kurbeln. Unsere Kurbeln sind eine solide geschmiedete ""strukturelle Verbund"" mit gehackter Kohlefaser Vinylesterharz-Formmasse verstärkt.
Kurbeln sind nicht herrlich, aber sie sind wichtig. Die meisten Abkürzungen Geld auf Werksdaten zu speichern und eigene Builds die Kurbel einzubeziehen. ""Billig"" und ""Heavy"" Kurbeln auf dem Fahrrad verwendet werden, mehrere tausend Dollar kosten. Mehr als oft nicht sind diese Kurbeln Aluminium geschmiedet. Wir mögen die geschmiedete Carbon-Version besser. Einfach die Festigkeit von Aluminium Kurbeln, bei einer niedrigeren Materialdichte.
Erhältlich in den Längen:
140, 142,5, 145, 147,5
150, 152,5, 155, 157,5
160, 162,5, 165, 167,5
170, 172,5, 175, 177,5

Der schnellste Stamm im Westen. Ein notwendiges Produkt für unsere langfristigen Pläne und ein ideales Produkt für geschmiedetem Kohlenstoffherstellung. Eine komplette Stamm kann in wenigen Minuten durchgeführt werden. Auch aus geschmiedetem Aluminium in der Regel Stiele einige sekundäre Bearbeitung erfordern. Wir sind ziemlich sicher, dass wir das schnellste, Rohstoff machen im Radsport zu trennen, einzudämmen. Derzeit verfügbar in 40mm, 50mm und 60mm.
Wie es gemacht wird:
Erweiterte Harze Bindungs ​​Kohlefasern, in einer Hochtemperatur- und Hochdruckform ausgebildet ist. Eine ausführliche Geschichte über die Materialien können nach 'geschmiedete Composites' gefunden werden, die eine Marke der Co-Entwickler ist. Verwendet für Verteidigungsprojekte und Elite-Autos und Clubs erlaubt diese Familie von Materialien für extrem schnelle Produktion und die Kosten pro Pfund ist jetzt wirtschaftlich. In einfachem Englisch. Wir heizen und High-End-Materialien drücken, öffnet sich das Teil in ca. 8 Minuten aus. Schleifen, Vorbereitungs- und Farbe.
Alle geschmiedetem Kohlenstoffteile werden in den USA hergestellt Teile Paarung sind COFO gemischt.
Farbakzente setzen Doppel Verarbeitung der teuersten Arbeitsschritt.
Standard ist alle gepanzerten schwarz.
Aufmerksamkeit auf die Details:
Typ 3 Hartbeschichtung Eloxieren wird auf den Aluminiumkettenblätter verwendet und ist in den USA für die längste Verschleißteile angewendet wir liefern können. Es wird auch auf die BSA Gewinde cups und Achsen verwendet.
Alle Farbe auf dem geschmiedeten Kohlenstoff verwendet wird, stammt aus der Firearm Industrie. Extrem robust und in vielen Farben erhältlich, fühlten wir uns dies der beste Weg, ein gutes Produkt zu erledigen war.
Alle Gewindeeinsätze sind derzeit Edelstahl.
Kurbelschraube Extraktion mit einem Innenring, nicht ein zweites Gewindebolzen behandelt.
Die Produktion Tretlager-Schrauben sind 10mm, kein Hex-Adapter benötigt.
Installationsvideos werden während der Verzögerung von dem Zeitpunkt geladen werden, die Kampagne beendet und das Geld an uns übertragen, das ist ungefähr 15 Tage nach Indiegogo.
Gewichte:
Kurbeln werden gewogen, um eine 156 Q-Achse, Vorbelastungsring und Abstandshalter verwenden, mit Farbe und Schrauben. Kettenblätter und Tretlager werden separat gewogen.

Noch ein paar Dinge, auf die Kurbeln:
Werden sie passen Ihre ______ Fahrrad? Ja. Es sei denn, Sie haben etwas unglaublich seltsam.
Kurbeln als Kurbelarme, Ihre Wahl der Länge und Ihrer Wahl der Achse verkauft, die den Q-Faktor bestimmen. Fügen Sie einen einzigen Ring oder eine Spinne für den Straßendoppel, Berg Doppel- oder Berg verdreifachen. Fügen Sie den rechten Tretlager oder Adapter.
Axle Optionen:
1. Straßen
2. Straßen Scheibe, Berg schmal
3. Boost, Berg breit
4. Fat Fahrrad (diese Achsen sind heute nicht auf Lager, aber bald)
Passen Sie jeden Kettenblatt, die mit SRAM GXP kompatibel ist.
Wir arbeiten eng mit Ihnen zusammen, bevor Sie kurbeln den richtigen Sitz mit dem Fahrrad, um sicherzustellen, versenden. Es wird auch eine Option zu ""leihen"" Werkzeuge sein. Dies kann nicht durch Indiegogo behandelt werden, da eine Zahlung gesammelt werden, dann wieder einmal Werkzeuge zurückgegeben werden. Die Kosten für alle notwendigen Tretlager Werkzeuge zu leihen ist der Preis für die Rücksendung. Dies ist nur mit Kurbel Vergünstigung erhältlich.

Beobachten Facebook für reale Welt Gewichte im Vergleichsbilder.


Hintergrund:
Gibt es einen Markt für erstaunlich leicht, preiswerte Kohlefaser Kurbeln und Stiele? Könnte dies der Beginn eines neuen Kapitels sein, ein, wo wir ein Haustier ärgern Lösung wirklich verfolgen können.
Bessere Fahrräder für alle Formen und Größen von Menschen.
Wenn Sie ein sechs Meter großer Kerl sind, haben Sie eine Welt von Möglichkeiten in dieser massiven Industrie. Wenn Sie für ein Kind, kurz Erwachsenen oder sogar ältere / andere mit körperlichen Einschränkungen Einkaufen sind die Entscheidungen in der Regel nichts, etwas exotisch, oder etwas, das nicht richtig passen.
Wollen Sie mehr wissen? Leiter auf mehr als auf unserer temporären Website: www.carbon.bike
Was wir brauchen und was Sie erhalten
Die Finanzierung zahlt offensichtlich für Kosten von Waren. Es wird auch Dinge mit klaren Erwartungen für das backer und für uns geht. Ab heute können 320 Kurbeln / Stiele pro Monat vorgenommen werden. 
Wenn es eine große Resonanz ist, können wir in einer organisierten Art und Weise liefern. Eine Wartezeit für die Paarung Teile herzustellen und Schiff, und dann Haus Eloxieren umdrehen. Die Pipeline wurde bereits getestet. Das war für uns wichtig, um sicherzustellen, dass wir liefern können. Wir haben Rohteil Bilder auf Facebook.
Der Aufprall
Idealerweise werden die Auswirkungen eine Option für hochwertige Teile sein, die preiswert sind und einen großen Wert für das Gewicht gespart darstellen.
Wenn (! Wenn) diese erfolgreich gestartet ist, sind die anderen Dinge, die wir haben bereit: Aluminium Tubeless-Felgen 28h, Scheibe nur für 20 "", 24"", 26 ""bereit Ufer- Proben genehmigt herzustellen off Ein 11-38t extrem leichte Cassette. für eine süße 1x10 Antriebsstrang -Proben zugelassen. Wir haben die Erkundung Sattelstütze und Bars begann jedoch durch Achse 20 "", 24"", 26 ""berg / Falz- / Liegerad Scheibe Gabeln (ready Werkzeuge zu schneiden!) würde unsere nächste große sein im Haus Fokus. Dann Fahrradrahmen.
Das ideale Ziel bringt ein 20 ""Rad zu inter Fahrrad. Wenn Sie wirklich ernsthaft über Kinder bekommen süchtig, gibt es einen wirklichen Unterschied in mit ihnen zwei Rädern Rakete reiten, oder versuchen, mit dem Fahrrad zu halten, dass die Hälfte wiegt ihre Körpergewicht. Wir würden schneiden 30% des Gewichts oder mehr, und nur leicht teurer als die aktuelle ""schwerwiegend"" sein (26 £ EEK!) Angebote auf dem Markt.
Danach, 24 "", 26"" und dann werden wir reasses. Die geschmiedeten Kohlenstoff-Trike / Liegerahmen, hitch-Racks und mehr. Die großen Unternehmen, die nicht jagen die kleineren Märkte ist verständlich, aber es sollte einige leichtere Alternativen sein. Die Frage ist, können wir diese Optionen zur Verfügung stellen und das Wort aus schnell genug, um einen echten Sprung auf diese zu machen. Wird es für eine Mischung von Gewichtseinsparungen und Preis derzeit nicht angeboten gefragt sein? Indiegogo stellte die beste Option, um herauszufinden.
Andere Möglichkeiten, wie Sie helfen können
Auch wenn Sie nicht auf dem Markt für Kurbeln sind oder Stängeln, teilen Sie bitte auf Facebook usw.
Innovation und alternative Lösungen sind nie eine schlechte Sache. Vielen Dank!
P. S.

Raw Nassteil, nach dem Schleifen und Taumeln. Um für die beste Farbe Bindung werden die Teile dann aufgeraut. Eine klare Gelcoat wäre schön, aber es ist bei weitem nicht der Schutz der Feuerwaffe Beschichtung und Gel ist 5-mal schwerer. Der Look ist einzigartig für diese Art von Materialien.

Die erste Generation von 140mm Kurbeln, und das Motorrad, das diese Reise begann.
34t Kettenblattschraubenset.


Zweite Generation Kurbeln, haben wir volle Werkzeug auf diesen.

Aber wir beschlossen, etwas Gewicht zu verlagern, Schuppen etwa 20 g pro Arm und einige Aspekte der für glattere Fertigungswerkzeugen ändern. 32t Kettenblatt.
Dritte und letzte Kurbelarme. Alle Werkzeuge ist abgeschlossen, bereit zu produzieren.

50mm im Einsatz einzudämmen. Wir verkaufen nicht die Kappen noch.
Wir wollen die Schraube zu überspritzen, damit es sauberer aussieht.

Dieses Rad ist in der Mitte einer Überholung. 40mm Schaft verschraubt werden.

Les bases:
Le coût de fabrication de forgeage, la réduction de poids de fibre de carbone.
Poids léger. Des prix compétitifs.
En cyclisme, ceci est une combinaison vraiment inhabituelle.
Comment fonctionne Indiegogo:
Votre carte de crédit sera débitée à la fin de la campagne le 12 mai 2016 21:59 PDT. Nous allons commencer l'expédition des commandes tout de suite, premier arrivé, premier servi.
Payez un frais d'expédition pour manivelles plus tout pédalier et ou plateau.
Livraison dans le monde entier par DHL.

Ce que nous faisons:
Manivelles carbone forgé. Nos manivelles sont forgé ""composite structurel"" solide en utilisant la fibre de carbone hachées renforcé vinylester résine composé de moulage.
Manivelles ne sont pas glorieux, mais ils sont importants. La plupart des raccourcis pour économiser de l'argent sur les spécifications de l'usine et la coutume construit impliquent la manivelle. ""Cheap"" et manivelles ""lourds"" sont utilisés sur des vélos qui coûtent plusieurs milliers de dollars. Plus souvent qu'autrement, ces manivelles sont en aluminium forgé. Nous aimons la version en carbone forgé mieux. Il suffit de la force de manivelles en aluminium, à une densité inférieure matériau.
Disponible dans les longueurs:
140, 142.5, 145, 147.5
150, 152.5, 155, 157.5
160, 162.5, 165, 167.5
170, 172,5, 175, 177,5

La tige la plus rapide dans l'ouest. Un produit nécessaire à nos plans à long terme et un produit idéal pour la fabrication de carbone forgé. Une tige complète peut être réalisée en quelques minutes. Même en aluminium forgé tiges nécessitent généralement des travaux d'usinage secondaire. Nous sommes à peu près certain que nous faisons le plus rapide, la matière première pour la pièce, de la tige dans le cyclisme. Actuellement disponible en 40mm, 50mm et 60mm.
Comment ça se fait:
des fibres de carbone des résines de liaison avancée, formés dans une haute température et moule de pression. Une histoire détaillée des matériaux peut être trouvé la recherche «composites forgés» qui est une marque de commerce des co-développeurs. Utilisé pour des projets de défense et les voitures d'élite et des clubs, cette famille de produits permet une production extrêmement rapide et le coût par livre est maintenant économiquement viable. En langage clair. Nous chauffons et presser des matériaux haut de gamme, la partie apparaît dans environ 8 minutes. Ponçage, préparation et de la peinture.
Toutes les pièces de carbone forgées sont faites aux Etats-Unis, l'accouplement des parties sont mélangées COFO.
accents de couleur exigent à double traitement de l'étape du travail le plus cher.
Standard est tout noir blindé.
Attention aux détails:
Type 3 revêtement dur anodisation est utilisé sur les plateaux en aluminium et est appliqué aux Etats-Unis pour les parties la plus longue portant que nous pouvons fournir. Il est également utilisé sur les tasses et les essieux BSA filetées.
Toutes les peintures utilisées sur le carbone forgé provient de l'industrie des armes à feu. Extrêmement résistant et disponible en plusieurs couleurs, nous avons senti c'était la meilleure façon de terminer un excellent produit.
Tous les inserts filetés sont actuellement en acier inoxydable.
extraction de boulon de manivelle est manipulé avec un anneau interne, pas un second boulon fileté.
Crankbolts de production sont 10mm, aucun adaptateur hex nécessaire.
Vidéos d'installation seront chargés pendant le délai à partir du moment de la campagne se termine et l'argent est transféré à nous, qui est d'environ 15 jours selon Indiegogo.
poids:
Pédaliers sont pesés à l'aide d'un 156 essieu Q, anneau et entretoises précharge, avec de la peinture et des vis. Plateaux et supports inférieurs sont pesés séparément.

Un peu plus de choses sur les pédaliers:
Vont-ils adapter à votre ______ vélo? Oui. Sauf si vous avez quelque chose d'incroyablement bizarre.
Pédaliers sont vendus comme bras de manivelle, votre choix de la longueur, et votre choix de l'essieu qui détermineront le Q-Factor. Ajouter un anneau simple ou une araignée pour double route, montagne double ou triple montagne. Ajouter le support ou l'adaptateur en bas à droite.
Options d'essieux:
1. route
2. disque Road, Montagne étroite
3. Boost, Montagne large
4. Fat vélo (ces axes ne sont pas en stock aujourd'hui, mais bientôt)
Monter tout plateau qui est compatible avec SRAM GXP.
Nous allons travailler en étroite collaboration avec vous avant vos manivelles expédier à assurer un bon ajustement avec votre vélo. Il y aura également une option d'outils «d'emprunt». Cela ne peut pas être manipulé par Indiegogo, comme un paiement sera prélevé, puis retourné une fois les outils sont retournés. Le coût d'emprunter tous les outils nécessaires de pédalier est le prix de l'expédition de retour. Ceci est uniquement disponible avec manivelle Perk.

Contexte:
Y at-il un marché pour raisonnablement légers, à des prix raisonnables manivelles en fibre de carbone et des tiges? Serait-ce un début d'un nouveau chapitre, celui où nous pouvons vraiment poursuivre la résolution d'une bête noire.
De meilleurs vélos pour toutes les formes et tailles de personnes.
Si vous êtes un gars de six pieds de haut, vous avez un monde de choix dans cette industrie massive. Si vous magasinez pour un enfant, à court adulte ou même les personnes âgées / autres avec des limitations physiques, les choix sont généralement rien, quelque chose d'exotique, ou quelque chose qui ne correspond pas à droite.
Veulent en savoir plus? Rendez-vous sur notre site Web temporaire: www.carbon.bike
Ce que nous devons et ce que vous obtenez
Le financement paie évidemment pour le coût des marchandises. Il obtient également les choses avec des attentes claires pour le bailleur de fonds et pour nous. En date d'aujourd'hui, 320 manivelles / tiges peuvent être faites un mois. 
S'il y a une grande réponse, nous pouvons livrer de manière organisée. Une période d'attente pour les pièces d'accouplement pour la fabrication et le navire, puis anodisation domestique tourner autour. Le pipeline a déjà été testé. Cela est important pour nous de nous assurer que nous pourrions offrir. Nous avons premières images partielles sur Facebook.
L'impact
Idéalement, l'impact sera une option pour les pièces de qualité à des prix raisonnables et représentent une grande valeur pour le poids enregistré.
Si (! Quand) ce lancement est réussi, les autres choses que nous avons prêts sont: Aluminium tubeless jantes 28h, disque uniquement pour 20 "", 24"", 26 ""prêt à fabriquer des échantillons hors de rivage approuvés Une 11-38t cassette extrêmement léger. pour une douce 1x10 train d'entraînement -samples approuvé. Nous avons commencé à explorer la tige de selle et des barres, cependant, par essieu 20 "", 24"", 26 ""/ pliage / fourches de disques gisants de montagne (prêt à couper les outils!) serait notre prochain grand dans la maison mise au point. Puis cadres de vélo.
L'objectif idéal apporte un «vélo 20 à inter-vélo. Si vous êtes vraiment sérieux au sujet des enfants accrochés, il y a une réelle différence dans les avoir rouler deux roquettes sur roues, ou en essayant de suivre avec un vélo qui pèse la moitié de leur poids corporel. Nous réduirions de 30% du poids ou plus, et être seulement légèrement plus cher que le «sérieux» actuel (26lbs EEK!) des offres sur le marché.
Après cela, 24 "", 26"" et puis nous reasses. Forgé trike de carbone / cadres gisants, racks d'attelage et plus. Les grandes entreprises ne chassaient plus petits marchés est compréhensible, mais il devrait y avoir quelques options plus légères. La question est, peut-on fournir ces options et obtenir le mot assez rapide pour faire un aller réel à ce. Y aura demande pour un mélange d'économies de poids et de prix pas actuellement offert? Indiegogo présenté la meilleure option pour le savoir.
D'autre façons que tu peut aider
Même si vous n'êtes pas sur le marché des manivelles ou des tiges, s'il vous plaît partager sur Facebook etc
Innovation et solutions de rechange ne sont jamais une mauvaise chose. Je vous remercie!
