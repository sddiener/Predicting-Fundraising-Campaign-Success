<p>Hi, my name is Reyhan Sofraci, creative designer and founder of Qiss Qiss...</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">I have always dreamed of creating my own line of swimwear. I have spent the last years thinking about it and now the adventure restarts with Qiss Qiss.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Qiss Qiss is a contemporary swimwear brand that we want to establish as a lifestyle of its own.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This year we would love to enter the Swim Week in Miami to showcase our new Qiss Qiss collection.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We have many rewards to offer, just look at the column on your right! Here's a photo of our sexy Qiss Qiss tank top!</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">This event is the most important fashion week for the swim industry in North America, anyone and everyone in the swim industry is there. Attending this event would be a great opportunity to meet with great stylists and buyers and get our stuff out there!</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We feel that a swim culture in this category is missing.  We all love to be flirtatious and have a joie de vivre and who better to share that feeling with other than other swim and life lovers like ourselves. Running on the beach, jumping into the sand, dancing with the fun sounds of famous DJ's on great catamarans, lakes and beaches, laughing, loving, remembering why we are alive, that's what its all about. . .</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Launching a new line of swimwear requires a lot of work... from designing the swimsuits to doing the photo shoots and most importantly preparing for the fashion show presentations in July... All we have achieved until today has only been made possible with the support of our family, friends, colleagues and all the people believing in our projects. I have always believed that achieving great projects can only be done with a team.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We have already done a small test run of the watches, so the factory has been proven for quality and timeframes, and both are excellent. The only issue we foresee is if the campaign goes through the roof and the volumes we need to make far exceed the levels we had envisaged. This is a great problem to have should it arise, and we will keep on top of the factory daily to keep up with the extra demand should this occur and try to minimise any delays wherever possible.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We have run the numbers thoroughly, and we are confident of delivering all of our promises, on time. Having worked on CrowdFunding campaigns in the past, we know how to account for all of the usual unforeseen expenses, time-sappers and issues, and thus we believe that the whole journey should go without a hitch.</p>

Every backer of our campaign, will have the option of having their name on our website forever on our ""Thank You Wall"" to all of those who helped launch our business..!
(you can of course remain anonymous if you wish too)





Risks & Challenges
We have already done a small test run of the watches, so the factory has been proven for quality and timeframes, and both are excellent. The only issue we foresee is if the campaign goes through the roof and the volumes we need to make far exceed the levels we had envisaged. This is a great problem to have should it arise, and we will keep on top of the factory daily to keep up with the extra demand should this occur and try to minimise any delays wherever possible.
We have run the numbers thoroughly, and we are confident of delivering all of our promises, on time. Having worked on CrowdFunding campaigns in the past, we know how to account for all of the usual unforeseen expenses, time-sappers and issues, and thus we believe that the whole journey should go without a hitch.

</h3>
<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">At the heart of the DAHU ski boot is a flexible molded polyurethane boot, fitted with a waterproof membrane and a real rubber sole, making them exceptionally comfortable for your feet. Boots that you can wear all day long in the ski resort for walking, hiking, driving, shopping and even clubbing. A stylish boot that combines both urban and ski resort looks.</span></div>
<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As you arrive on the slopes, you just need to slip on the exoskeleton, an external shell with a rigid sole combined with two articulated spoilers: one at the rear that grips your heel and the other at the front that you close around your foot. The two spoilers clip together and lock perfectly using a system with two buckles. You get the same performance as a traditional ski boot, but DAHU combines this with vastly superior comfort and perfect control over your skis.</span></div>

<h3>The DAHU Ski boots</h3>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Performance</b> : Available in two different flex patterns (medium and hard) and with various interfaces between the snow boots and hard exoskeletons, the DAHU ski boots give you the same performance as your traditional ski boots.</li>
<li>
<b>Comfort</b> : Equipped with a waterproof and breathable membrane and Primaloft's thermal insulation, your feet will finally feel comfortable in ski boots. Your feet are not imprisoned in a rigid shell and breathe better and the inner Sidas sole can even be replaced by an orthopedic one for high-end customization.</li>
<li>
<b>Fashion</b> : DAHU's microfiber and exoskeleton offers great possibilities in terms of design keeping up with fashion on the high street and on the slopes</li>
<li>
<b>Weight</b> : With an average weight of 2.2 kg per boot, DAHU offers some of the lightest boots on the market</li>
<li>
<b>Cost </b>: Buying separate ski boots and snow boots of the same quality will cost you approximately 715€, that is 125€ more than DAHU Ski boots</li>

The DAHU boot is a hybrid between a plastic ski boot and a soft winter boot. The soft boot can be used for all kinds of winter activities, and once it is inserted into the exoskeleton, the DAHU becomes a ski boot meeting all requirements of the ski industry, delivering full performance on the slope. All parts and functions as well as the interface connection are very well designed and crafted – and easy to operate.

A revolutionary product, that combines a high performance skiing experience with all other winter activities such as snowshoe hiking, sledding or such a little walk through the village after a nice skiing day. All that, without having to change shoes and with great comfort. I have tried these shoes on personally, and it feels amazing. Technically the concept works perfectly, and I can’t feel any difference to other shoes in its range regarding its stiffness and quality. For people who are looking for high level of comfort while skiing, but who don’t want to miss out on performance, I can strongly recommend this new innovative ski boot."" <b>Hans-Martin Heierling  </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">(</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Coming from a family with over 125 years of experience in the ski boot industry and today the oldest ski boot manufacture worldwide, Hans-Martin Heierling is today one of the best known ski boot fitting specialists.

<h3>How it all began ?</h3>
<div>
<p>What is a skier's life really like today? Don't say that your feet have never suffered after being squashed all day inside your ski boots with their tough shell.</p>
<p>We have all dreamed of taking off our ski boots, if only a moment when they stop for lunch, go shopping at the end of the day or to go for a drink after the slopes, and only to put them back on if they really had to? Everybody or almost everybody has been there, including Nicolas Frey, the founder of DAHU Sports Company.</p>
<p>DAHU's story began in 2009 when the wife of Nicolas Frey could not find any ski boots that did not hurt her feet, even after trying top of the line injected boots that were molded to fit them. But, where most of us accept defeat, he saw an opportunity to develop something different, something revolutionary: ""We needed to completely rethink the design of modern ski boots."" he explains. He started to design the first prototypes on paper and to put them together in his garage.</p>
<p>A trained designer with a passion for winter sports, he began the task with no preconceptions and followed his instinct. However, the task proved to be far from simple. Trying to find the right compromise between rigidity and flexibility, safety and comfort, performance and style... Reinventing something whose design has not changed for 40 years. A real hunt for the ideal ski boot began until the goal was reached after four long years of development. The legend became a reality!</p>
<p>What was once just a dream became a vision; and from this vision the dream took shape: DAHU was brought to life!</p>
<br/>
</div>
<h3>Why the name ""DAHU"" ?</h3>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/962645/files/20141027064907-Standard.png?1414417747"" src="""" style=""""/></p>DAHU... is the name of a wild animal that is said to have evolved shorter legs on one side to suit the slopes of the Swiss mountains...
<p>Of course, this is nothing but a legend...</p>
<p>Now, DAHU is also the name of the perfect ski boots, so advanced and innovative that they offer high performance on your skis, are comfortable, stylish and suited for walking, hiking, driving and much more.</p>
<p>And this is the reality...</p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What is DAHU's vision ?</h3>
<p>DAHU's vision is to shake and change the ski market forever, exactly like carving skis did in the 1990s.</p>
<p>The time is over now when skiers had to suffer to practice their favorite sport and leisure. All together, we can put a term to this ignominy and give a new youth to winter sports.</p>
<p>After selling almost 1'000 pairs in Europe during last Winter 2013/14, we need your help to grow more and offer the first ski boots bringing together performance and comfort.</p>

</div></div>","How does it work ?

At the heart of the DAHU ski boot is a flexible molded polyurethane boot, fitted with a waterproof membrane and a real rubber sole, making them exceptionally comfortable for your feet. Boots that you can wear all day long in the ski resort for walking, hiking, driving, shopping and even clubbing. A stylish boot that combines both urban and ski resort looks.
As you arrive on the slopes, you just need to slip on the exoskeleton, an external shell with a rigid sole combined with two articulated spoilers: one at the rear that grips your heel and the other at the front that you close around your foot. The two spoilers clip together and lock perfectly using a system with two buckles. You get the same performance as a traditional ski boot, but DAHU combines this with vastly superior comfort and perfect control over your skis.





The DAHU Ski boots



Performance : Available in two different flex patterns (medium and hard) and with various interfaces between the snow boots and hard exoskeletons, the DAHU ski boots give you the same performance as your traditional ski boots.

Comfort : Equipped with a waterproof and breathable membrane and Primaloft's thermal insulation, your feet will finally feel comfortable in ski boots. Your feet are not imprisoned in a rigid shell and breathe better and the inner Sidas sole can even be replaced by an orthopedic one for high-end customization.

Fashion : DAHU's microfiber and exoskeleton offers great possibilities in terms of design keeping up with fashion on the high street and on the slopes

Weight : With an average weight of 2.2 kg per boot, DAHU offers some of the lightest boots on the market

Cost : Buying separate ski boots and snow boots of the same quality will cost you approximately 715€, that is 125€ more than DAHU Ski boots



What's inside ?



Grilamid L Polyamide 12 used for the exoskeletons
Microfiber with high reistance to flexing, abrasion and water
Waterproof and breathable membrane
Primaloft ECO FOOTWEAR thermal insulation

PU memory foam for optimized comfort inside the boots

Sidas inner soles specially designed for winter sports
Real vulcanized rubber soles



Already 3 highly coveted Awards : ISPO & Red Dot

ISPO Award - Product of the Year 2014/15

""Even though modern ski boots have become high-tech products with many fascinating functional solutions, many people are unhappy about these bulky and stiff hardshells on their feet when it comes to general comfort – especially when walking or standing once the skis are taken off. The DAHU boot is a hybrid between a plastic ski boot and a soft winter boot. The soft boot can be used for all kinds of winter activities, and once it is inserted into the exoskeleton, the DAHU becomes a ski boot meeting all requirements of the ski industry, delivering full performance on the slope. All parts and functions as well as the interface connection are very well designed and crafted – and easy to operate. The jury agreed that DAHU deserves to be the Overall Winner with this very sophisticated and fully developed product that has the potential to revolutionize the ski boot market."" Wolfgang Greiner, Publisher SkiPresse Germany & Member of the ISPO Jury


Red Dot Award - Product Design 2014

Top 100 Swiss Start-ups : 28th rank 









What professionals say about DAHU ?

""When I first saw this ski boot at the ISPO Winter Show 2013, I was convinced that this product has a bright future ahead of it. A revolutionary product, that combines a high performance skiing experience with all other winter activities such as snowshoe hiking, sledding or such a little walk through the village after a nice skiing day. All that, without having to change shoes and with great comfort. I have tried these shoes on personally, and it feels amazing. Technically the concept works perfectly, and I can’t feel any difference to other shoes in its range regarding its stiffness and quality. For people who are looking for high level of comfort while skiing, but who don’t want to miss out on performance, I can strongly recommend this new innovative ski boot."" Hans-Martin Heierling  (Coming from a family with over 125 years of experience in the ski boot industry and today the oldest ski boot manufacture worldwide, Hans-Martin Heierling is today one of the best known ski boot fitting specialists. Many World Cup Stars such as Didier Cuche, Bode Miller, Ivica Kostelic, Lindsey Vonn or Tina Maze already used his expertise and knowledge to enhance their performance on the snow.)  http://www.heierling.ch

How it all began ?

What is a skier's life really like today? Don't say that your feet have never suffered after being squashed all day inside your ski boots with their tough shell.
We have all dreamed of taking off our ski boots, if only a moment when they stop for lunch, go shopping at the end of the day or to go for a drink after the slopes, and only to put them back on if they really had to? Everybody or almost everybody has been there, including Nicolas Frey, the founder of DAHU Sports Company.
DAHU's story began in 2009 when the wife of Nicolas Frey could not find any ski boots that did not hurt her feet, even after trying top of the line injected boots that were molded to fit them. But, where most of us accept defeat, he saw an opportunity to develop something different, something revolutionary: ""We needed to completely rethink the design of modern ski boots."" he explains. He started to design the first prototypes on paper and to put them together in his garage.
A trained designer with a passion for winter sports, he began the task with no preconceptions and followed his instinct. However, the task proved to be far from simple. Trying to find the right compromise between rigidity and flexibility, safety and comfort, performance and style... Reinventing something whose design has not changed for 40 years. A real hunt for the ideal ski boot began until the goal was reached after four long years of development. The legend became a reality!
What was once just a dream became a vision; and from this vision the dream took shape: DAHU was brought to life!


Why the name ""DAHU"" ?

DAHU... is the name of a wild animal that is said to have evolved shorter legs on one side to suit the slopes of the Swiss mountains...
Of course, this is nothing but a legend...
Now, DAHU is also the name of the perfect ski boots, so advanced and innovative that they offer high performance on your skis, are comfortable, stylish and suited for walking, hiking, driving and much more.
And this is the reality...


What is DAHU's vision ?
DAHU's vision is to shake and change the ski market forever, exactly like carving skis did in the 1990s.
The time is over now when skiers had to suffer to practice their favorite sport and leisure. All together, we can put a term to this ignominy and give a new youth to winter sports.
After selling almost 1'000 pairs in Europe during last Winter 2013/14, we need your help to grow more and offer the first ski boots bringing together performance and comfort.





Why DAHU is looking for funds on Indiegogo ?

Today, we are expecting to gather 500'000 € in order to cover our operational costs during this second season on the market and if, our target is exceeded, to already start the developments of new innovative products that we have in mind.

<br/><p></p></span><p></p></span></span></span></span></div>","Having to take trains and buses everyday and walk the last mile to destination has always made us wonder, what if we can also be on wheels for that last part of the journey? This has lead us to look into various means of lightweight personal wheels.
Aren't there already electric scooters out in the market? Yes there are. However, we have all 3 very important attributes that would make a scooter really desirable. If you do not want to embarass yourself by dragging a heavy, unsightly scooter to work, with the battery depleting halfway during your trip, our GP Board is the solution. It is:
1) Lightweight - Being lightweight and compact, it folds up effortlessly, while being durable for everyday use.
2) One charge - One charge brings you 10 km, easily to your nearest station and back. Just charge every night after getting home and you'll be ready for your next ride.
3) Responsive - Accelerator and brake buttons right at your fingertips to allow for faster response to situations, ensuring a safe ride!
Manufacturing this scooter is expensive, especially when we demand the best quality for our product. Also, we understand the pain of walking to train stations in the morning when we are barely even awake. 
Therefore, alleviate your morning blues by waking up later, enjoying a nutritious breakfast, scooting your way to the train station or bus stops quickly and stylishly,and of course get to your destination punctually.
Your pledges will help in making joyous mornings possible for you and others!
And now... the product that makes travelling a fun one

Powered by a brushless motor and li-ion battery pack
Foldable to bring up to a train or buses.


How bad can a weekday be when even what you step on looks so cool?

<h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">Australian women’s wear designed specifically for you, crowd-sourced and
delivered without the expensive price tag!</h3>
<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">Here's our
story:</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We’ve spent
many frustrating years looking for garments that fit our body types. </span>We didn’t
think we were alone, so we asked many women what they found the most
frustrating when buying clothing. It seemed unanimous, FIT.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">After
listening to Women everywhere, we created a way to fit women of various body
types with garments we love.  We wanted to get closer to the people who
buy them, and sell them at an affordable price.</span></p>
<h4 style=""text-align: justify;"">Here’s how
we're doing it:</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Australian
Designed with Sizing Variations</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">For the last
six months, we have been working tirelessly to redefine standard women’s sizes.
We started with the sizing, developing a range of bust sizes and height
variations and then followed with the design to ensure that our sizing system
would work with each garment to give the best fit possible. With a core
range of classic basics to build a solid base for your wardrobe, we are
offering you the Classic Annie Business Shirt for just $99.00. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Crowd-sourced</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Other
fashion brands guess what their customers want, we’re letting you decide. We
have designed a complete collection from the perfectly fitted shirt to
suiting and dresses and you have the ultimate word in what gets produced.
 If we can raise the capital we need, we will produce the shirts and
with further funding we will be able to produce the suiting and dresses.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Delivered to
you at wholesale</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Most quality
shirts cost around $150.00 and sometimes you even have to have these altered to
fit properly. We are selling our designed-to-fit Classic Annie Shirt for
$99.00, shipped directly to you. International orders will incur an additional
$10.00 shipping fee and this can be paid via the $1 perk by changing the amount
to $10.00. To expedite orders, please use the paypal option for your contribution. </span></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Our

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Fashion has
been a labour of love. We wanted clothes that fitted us.  We wanted
clothing that was going to make us look and feel good, regardless of our frame.
We found that we were not alone and expanded our ideas and created our unique
sizing system. Enabling more people to have the same experience of
designed-to-fit clothing with off the shelf pricing. Nothing will change, that
because it’s the brand we’ve built.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In the

a tapered waist and French cuffs.  Not too tight and not too loose, a
timeless cut that will never go out of style.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>Fabric</i> – For all of our shirts we are using fine

quantities. (A major reason why most brands don't offer such choice!) Once we
raise enough funds, we will advise you that these have become available.  </span></p>

<h3> WHO AM I?</h3>
<p>So here's the low down. My name is Irene Fonda Varkis aka FONDA. I received my Masters Degree in Fashion Design from The Istituto Marangoni in Milan, Italy. After graduating I continued to travel and work abroad as a freelance designer. After I did this, that and the other, I returned home to Florida to begin my work on/as FONDA.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today and I have a screen-printing shop and design studio with my partner. What can I say? I love the message tee.</p>
<h3>WHAT AM I DOING?</h3>
<p>I plan to present my first collection this year for FONDA.                               </p>
<h3>Abierta  Spring / Summer 2014</h3>
<p>The word Abierta means open in Spanish and pretty simply that is what I am now.</p>
<p><em>      Abierta~Just a street girl with an old world soul.    </em></p>
<h3>WHAT IS FONDA?</h3>
<p>FONDA is a womens ready-to-wear label that will show collections that specialize in attire for warmer climate locations. ~<em>Imagine Resort wear year round.</em></p>
<h3>WHAT IS FONDA ALL ABOUT?</h3>
<p>FONDA is urban chic with a rush of femininity. Prints that make you feel like you're on vacation and fabrics that blend luxury and comfort. Pieces that not only look great but are also easy to wear, lightweight and breathable. Perfect for year-round tropical climate. ~<em>We're talking Pima Cottons &amp; Linen blends.</em></p>
<h3>WHAT DO I NEED?</h3>
<p>I'm doing this project for two reasons. To raise funding to help with the production of my samples and to make new friends. A simple like or follow is great help too! Like FONDA on Facebook, Follow @ivfonda on Twitter, and check out FONDA on Tumblr at biglovefonda.tumblr.com</p>
<h3>HOW MUCH FUNDING DO I NEED AND WHERE WILL IT GO?</h3>
<p>I'm asking for $4000.00 and it's pretty simple where it's going. Here's the breakdown-</p>
<ul>
<li>$2850    Sampling Materials ~Specifically Custom Printed Fabrics.</li>
<li>$750      Cost of products for Limited Edition Weekender Collection.</li>
<li>$350      Indiegogo Fee.</li>

<h3>WHAT WILL I DO AFTER THE MONEY IS SPENT?</h3>
<p>Once my samples are made I will begin the hunt! This is where I start approaching specialty shops and boutiques to carry my collection. I've even got a few eagerly waiting for a preview. I'll also be holding viewing parties and attending trade shows.</p>
<h3>WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU?</h3>
<p>I promise to keep in touch if you do too. Like I said earlier, this project isn't just about raising necessary funds, it's also about FONDA making new friends! And Indiegogo is a great platform to do so!  Like FONDA on Facebook, follow @ivfonda on Twitter, and check out FONDA on Tumblr at biglovefonda.tumblr.com</p>
<h3>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>I have been working in the realm of design and production for a while now- so luckily I understand how this process works. I know there will be many last minute details, unexpected delays, expenses and obstacles. I will rely on my commitment to my work, my experience and the strong community I have built with fellow creatives.      </p>
<p>Our primary risk is meeting the timeline for shipping orders. If we significantly exceed our funding expectations we wil bring in the necessary resources to expedite the production and shipping process. And we will keep you informed of our progress if unexpected delays are encountered.</p>

<p> </p></div>","WHO AM I?
So here's the low down. My name is Irene Fonda Varkis aka FONDA. I received my Masters Degree in Fashion Design from The Istituto Marangoni in Milan, Italy. After graduating I continued to travel and work abroad as a freelance designer. After I did this, that and the other, I returned home to Florida to begin my work on/as FONDA.
Fast-forward to today and I have a screen-printing shop and design studio with my partner. What can I say? I love the message tee.
WHAT AM I DOING?
I plan to present my first collection this year for FONDA.                               
Abierta  Spring / Summer 2014
The word Abierta means open in Spanish and pretty simply that is what I am now.
      Abierta~Just a street girl with an old world soul.    
WHAT IS FONDA?
FONDA is a womens ready-to-wear label that will show collections that specialize in attire for warmer climate locations. ~Imagine Resort wear year round.
WHAT IS FONDA ALL ABOUT?
FONDA is urban chic with a rush of femininity. Prints that make you feel like you're on vacation and fabrics that blend luxury and comfort. Pieces that not only look great but are also easy to wear, lightweight and breathable. Perfect for year-round tropical climate. ~We're talking Pima Cottons & Linen blends.
WHAT DO I NEED?
I'm doing this project for two reasons. To raise funding to help with the production of my samples and to make new friends. A simple like or follow is great help too! Like FONDA on Facebook, Follow @ivfonda on Twitter, and check out FONDA on Tumblr at biglovefonda.tumblr.com
HOW MUCH FUNDING DO I NEED AND WHERE WILL IT GO?
I'm asking for $4000.00 and it's pretty simple where it's going. Here's the breakdown-

$2850    Sampling Materials ~Specifically Custom Printed Fabrics.
$750      Cost of products for Limited Edition Weekender Collection.
$350      Indiegogo Fee.
WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?

I have already begun researching equipment and locations to support increased production. Additionally I have also begun researching manufacturing facilities I could potentially contract with. With my previous business, I learned how to formulate recipes that are scalable, and made sure BLUE TAX product recipes could keep up with my ambition to make BLUE TAX big.The most unpredictable challenge right now is COVID-19. I am aware of my suppliers' inventory for my ingredients and materials, as well as extended shipping and delivery times. I have set reward delivery times with this in mind and will plan ahead to ensure on time delivery of rewards. And, of course, I will keep my backers informed of any changes that may happen along our journey together.",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

I am working everyday to be part of the future of fashion.</div>
<h3><strong>THE CAMPAIGN</strong></h3>
<p>This campaign is to raise funds to create and launch the Spring/Summer 2014 Collection to be shown in fashion weeks this next fall, and to be shown to buyers and stores for wider distribution, which will then perpetuate company growth.  These funds will also be used to plan and execute fashion show events in both LA and NYC.  I am working and collaborating with successful professionals in various sectors of the industry to guide and assist me to ensure maximum success via this campaign. </p>

<h3><strong>HOW I GOT HERE</strong></h3>
<div>I grew up in Seattle, WA after being adopted by my incredible parents, raised alongside my amazing brothers and sisters, and with a feeling that anything is possible.  I have always felt like there is more for me in the world. A way to positively affect people and make a difference.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I served a two year mission in South America and then came back to study at Brigham Young University where I majored in Humanities and Art History Studies and minored in Spanish.  All the while working in banking and finance.  I knew I had to do something different with my life. I looked into may creative careers and found fashion to be the answer.  Fashion is something we all partake in and it can generate the same level of awe and happiness as any piece of art in a museum. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I wanted to create and share a product with people that would inspire them, give them a voice, and make the everyday a little bit better. I left Utah and moved to Los Angeles and started my design career at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising.  After finishing the program and my first couple collections I was accepted into the advanced design program, but had a six month break before starting. A friend suggested I apply to Project Runway on Facebook and posted the application on my Facebook page.  I filled it out, made a DVD and sent it in. I had no idea I would make it to NYC and on to the 9th season of the show.  It was a whirlwind of incredible times with the bestest of friends.  I may not have won but I was voted back on by my peers whom I love very much.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After the show, I returned to LA and started the advanced design program all the while creating multiple collections and attending fashion weeks all over the country. I have since been working for major design companies and now know I have something unique and special to offer the world.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>A MILLION THANK YOUS</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thank you for believing in me, for giving me hope and for being a supportive friend.  You mean the world to me and I will never forget the generosity of others.  To give back is one of the greatest gifts and I hope to give back all the days of my life.</div>

<p>We are <b>Abhati Suisse</b>, a Swiss-Indian collaboration.
</p>
<p><b>Abhati</b> natural products are
developed with our minds on the earth, an eye for beauty, and our hearts in the
right place, to improve health, sanitation, and education.</p>
<p>Our initial product launch is <b>One Hand Washes the

<p><b>One Hand Washes the Other</b> is developed
with nature in mind, from the ingredients to the packaging and ultimately to

colorants and are free of chemical preservatives, petroleum derivatives, and

<p>Your skin will be cleansed, pampered, and receive
“peak” protection from the herbal extracts of plants native to the Indian
Himalayas and the Swiss Alps.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Your donation will help launch this product.</b></p>
<p><b>Your product purchase will help buy toilets for
schools that have none.</b></p>
<p><b>The dirty facts on poor sanitation</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>4 out of 10 people worldwide or 2.5
billion, have no proper place to poop</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>public defecation leads to disease,
epidemics and social exclusion</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>diarrhea, a result of poor sanitation,
causes 1 death every 20 seconds</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>sanitation can reduce contamination
and resulting deaths by 37.5%</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>hand washing alone reduces deaths by
35%</p>
<p><b>Our first product</b></p>
<p>Since
proper hand washing promotes hygiene and health, we thought it appropriate to
launch the <b>Abhati</b> <b>“Beauty with Dignity” campaign</b> with
our hand wash solution<b> One Hand Washes
the Other. </b>Your donation is needed to kick start our first production
batch run and distribution.</p>
<p><b>Our progress so far</b></p>
<p>Besides
the R&amp;D for the most awesome skin care line in bi-cultural cooperation, we
are currently in talks with a major international retail chain in Switzerland
to distribute our first product. Contacts have also been established to a few
other potential retail chains abroad, which have shown interest in supporting
Abhati.</p>
<p><strong>FAQ Abhati Suisse: Background and Future</strong></p>
<p><strong>Who is the founder and what's her motivation?</strong></p>
<p>My name is Anju Rupal. I was born in London to parents of Indian
heritage. Raised in the UK, with an Indian-British upbringing, I first went to
India at the age of 22. That was more than 20 years ago; I was walking on the
streets of Mumbai, when a young<br/>
woman named Sita, with 2 children, nudged me from behind on the shoulder. When<br/>
I turned to her, she looked at me with shame in her eyes and asked me, in her
urgency, to look after her two children while she sought a quiet place to go to the toilet.<br/>
This moment and the expression on that woman’s face have stayed with me ever<br/>
since, It has been my inspiration in founding Abhati.</p>
<p>I worked many years as a policy and social worker with
victims of domestic violence in the UK &amp; Switzerland. As an entrepreneur, I can look back on more than 10 years of experience. I'm a global
citizen; a Swiss wife and mother of 2. And I recently founded an emergency
walk-in clinic for children in Zurich Bahnhofstrasse and was on the board of an
NGO called Weforest.</p>
<p><strong>Who else is involved?</strong></p>
<p>Divya Kalra, Campaign Manager, brings 8 years of project management
&amp; supply chain optimization experience to the table. She has an IT
background and holds an MBA. She is well connected in India and Switzerland.
Her commitment to Abhati is a matter of heart and soul.</p>
<p>Belinda Fleischmann, Focuses on building strategic alliances
between commercial, philanthropic and NGO communities. She specializes in the
fields of water, health, education and clean energy. Belinda serves as an
Advisor for the World Toilet Organization, which focuses on health, dignity and
well-being for all through sustainable sanitation. She holds an MSc in
Urbanization &amp; Development from the London School of Economics &amp;
Political Science.</p>
<p><strong>What is the meaning of Abhati?</strong></p>
<p>Abhati is an old Sanskrit (Ancient Indian language) word, which means
""shine"" or ""illuminate your soul"". </p>
<p></p>

<p>
<b>Abhati Suisse</b> has succeeded in attracting followers with pertinent skills

<p></p>
<p><strong>What is unique about Abhati's approach?</strong></p>
<p>To create awareness and break taboos.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Education:</b></p>
<p>Our <b>“One Hand Washes the Other”</b> school curriculum will outline the way
to effective hand washing and its benefits in preventing disease and deaths.
The goal here is to inspire a change in behavior towards ending public
defecation and creating good hand washing practices.</p>
<p><b>Installation:</b></p>
<p>We partner with trusted NGO's like Sulabh International to install the toilets needed in
schools. Our strategy is to create local partnerships, community ownership, and
long-term infrastructure maintenance.</p>
<p><b>Which schools is Abhati targeting for Sanitation?</b></p>

We have targeted schools in India for phase one.<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>

The dirty facts on poor sanitation
· 
4 out of 10 people worldwide or 2.5
billion, have no proper place to poop
· 
public defecation leads to disease,
epidemics and social exclusion
· 
diarrhea, a result of poor sanitation,
causes 1 death every 20 seconds
· 
sanitation can reduce contamination
and resulting deaths by 37.5%
· 
hand washing alone reduces deaths by
35%
Our first product
Since
proper hand washing promotes hygiene and health, we thought it appropriate to
launch the Abhati “Beauty with Dignity” campaign with
our hand wash solution One Hand Washes
the Other. Your donation is needed to kick start our first production
batch run and distribution.
Our progress so far
Besides
the R&D for the most awesome skin care line in bi-cultural cooperation, we
are currently in talks with a major international retail chain in Switzerland
to distribute our first product. Contacts have also been established to a few
other potential retail chains abroad, which have shown interest in supporting
Abhati.
FAQ Abhati Suisse: Background and Future
Who is the founder and what's her motivation?
My name is Anju Rupal. I was born in London to parents of Indian
heritage. Raised in the UK, with an Indian-British upbringing, I first went to
India at the age of 22. That was more than 20 years ago; I was walking on the
streets of Mumbai, when a young
woman named Sita, with 2 children, nudged me from behind on the shoulder. When
I turned to her, she looked at me with shame in her eyes and asked me, in her
urgency, to look after her two children while she sought a quiet place to go to the toilet.
This moment and the expression on that woman’s face have stayed with me ever
since, It has been my inspiration in founding Abhati.
I worked many years as a policy and social worker with
victims of domestic violence in the UK & Switzerland. As an entrepreneur, I can look back on more than 10 years of experience. I'm a global
citizen; a Swiss wife and mother of 2. And I recently founded an emergency
walk-in clinic for children in Zurich Bahnhofstrasse and was on the board of an
NGO called Weforest.
Who else is involved?
Divya Kalra, Campaign Manager, brings 8 years of project management
& supply chain optimization experience to the table. She has an IT
background and holds an MBA. She is well connected in India and Switzerland.
Her commitment to Abhati is a matter of heart and soul.
Belinda Fleischmann, Focuses on building strategic alliances
between commercial, philanthropic and NGO communities. She specializes in the
fields of water, health, education and clean energy. Belinda serves as an
Advisor for the World Toilet Organization, which focuses on health, dignity and
well-being for all through sustainable sanitation. She holds an MSc in
Urbanization & Development from the London School of Economics &
Political Science.
What is the meaning of Abhati?
Abhati is an old Sanskrit (Ancient Indian language) word, which means
""shine"" or ""illuminate your soul"".

Profound, designer jewelry <em>…for him.</em></strong></h3>
<p>As a man, it's been difficult finding the type of jewelry truly reflective of the style and character I feel accurately portrays the innermost me. I was constantly searching for more aggressive, more attractive, more meaningful representations of who I am and want to be, to no avail. Frustration led me to start sketching and designing in pursuit of my perfect piece.</p>
<p>I wanted a piece that screamed, ""I am Strong! I am Wise! I am Powerful!"" Being a Leo, a Lion served as the perfect symbol of strength and power. My wife, strangely being named, Wisdom, served as my inspiration to sculpt a strong, seductive female guardian. Together, they embodied the idea, Leo's Wisdom, which stands for Kingship, Power, and Wisdom.</p>
<p>I hand-built my prototypes, carved my samples, and combined the perfect balance of precious stone, precious metals, and Earth to create the first Leo's Wisdom necklace, <strong><em>The Guarded Sovereign</em></strong>.</p>
<p><img alt=""Leo's Wisdom® Signature Guarded Sovereign I"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i904.photobucket.com/albums/ac241/sinsation84/LeosWisdom/LW_Sig.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Leo's Wisdom® Signature - Guarded Sovereign I""/></p>
<p>Surprisingly, my ideas and unique style garnered overwhelming responses. Whether I went to the gym, for a jog, or even to the supermarket, I was constantly flagged down by men and women alike asking me the same questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where on Earth did you find such a piece?</li>
<li>
<img alt=""Leo's Wisdom® Lion's Den"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i904.photobucket.com/albums/ac241/sinsation84/LeosWisdom/LW_LD.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Leo's Wisdom® Lion's Den""/>How can I get one myself?</li>
</ul>
<p>I designed a few more pieces for myself and, though they were never intended for sale, ended up selling them right off my neck. We realized there was a strong desire for such powerful and reflective jewelry. Each creation had strong meaning and significance in relation to music, truth, spirituality, and expression. Every Leo's Wisdom piece exudes its own personality while embodying yours. Leo's Wisdom is a King in its own domain.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>The Issue</h3>
<p>Leo's Wisdom is comprised of fine gems, Sterling Silver, and stones straight from the Earth. Owning a Leo's Wisdom piece is an instantly gratifying source of pride. It's like wearing a crown around your neck. Realizing this, I decided to offer my pieces to the world. But there was a big problem. I only had one of each design because I was making them by hand in my tiny shop in the attic of my home. I had no way to replicate my one-of-a-kind prototypes, and it takes an incredible amount of time, resources, and money to generate just one piece. This not only drives up cost, it also drives down the ability to offer my designs on more than a first-come, first-served basis.</p>

<h3>Keep The Swan Swimming II</h3>
The original Indiegogo campaign did an amazing job of raising the needed funds for Lawyers, The ID scanner, and fines. We even had enough to pay a few bills, but we have a few more. Rent still needs to be payed, we still need to keep the heat on so the pipes don't freeze, and we need to keep the lights on. Plus alot of you didn't find out about our efforts until the campaign had ended, so here's your chance to help too.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>PERKS we have a few things left over from the Original Campaign</h3>
<p>We aren't asking for something for nothing, we want you to be proud of our local pub, fly the Swan colors, put your name on the bar, curate the jukebox, throw a party, or just have that warm fuzzy feeling of helping out.</p>
<ul>
<li>For a donation of $20, you're invited to a series of Donor Only parties, with some of the best musicians the Hudson Valley has to offer - reggae, blues, jazz, acoustic rock, and more.</li>
<li>The Package, You get a limited edition T-shirt, an Invite to the Parties, and your first draft beer, plus the great feeling of keeping a Tivoli Landmark open. All for $50</li>
<li>Ever wish your favorite albums were on the Swan's Jukebox? Well here is your chance. Pick your top 20, we'll add them to the Juke for a Month, your top 5 will stay on for a year, maybe longer, or It's cold up here in New York. With that in Mind we are adding a Bat Swan Hoodie, along with an Invite to the Donor only shows, and your first draft beer, once we reopen, as always. $75</li>
<li>Dinner for 2, including your first drink, and any one of the great shows the Swan presents throughout the year. The perfect date night. All for $100</li>
<li>Are you a REAL music fan? For a minimum donation of $150 you get a pass to see every show, for a year, just flash your pass (and your 21 over ID, we don’t want to go through this again) and you’re in.</li>
<li>Want to own a piece of the Swan? For a donation of $250 we’ll put your name or the name of someone you’d like to honor, on a Brass Plaque and mount it on the edge of the bar.</li>
<li>Not enough to be a face in the crowd? Do you want to be THE HOST of the party? For $500 you can be the presenter of the night, your choice of a Band or DJ, you introduce them, you get some drink tickets, after expenses, you might even make some money.</li>
<li>That sounds good, but you’d rather have a private party for 50 friends, no door charge, a great band or DJ, and a keg of your choice? Donate $1000 and that dream can come true.</li>
<li>Trying to plan a wedding, fundraiser, or big birthday or anniversary bash? How about the food, beer and wine, venue, MC/officiator, and lots of other details and expenses? For $5000 we will provide those things for 50 people.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>We know a lot of you’ want to just give something back to the place that has given you so much, theses perks are just our way of thanking you for loving us. Unlike many crowd source fund raising, even if we don’t reach our full goal your donations will still help us. We have a few other things we can try to again serve you, but they are last resorts.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I have had the Swan for 8 years now, most businesses of this type fail within the first year or two. We have a huge overhead, many bills, but we are in it because we love our community of friends and think we offer a place that is unique and a place that brings people together. We have faced rough patches before, and we’ve weathered them. Please help us keep swimming, and enjoy the clear skies on the Swan’s patio again this spring and summer. If you can’t help us monetarily, please help by spreading the word of this campaign. Tell your friends that you’ve met at the Swan, or partied with at the Swan. I try to stay in contact with as many of the past and present customers as I am able. If I see a name or face I recognize on Face Book, I send a Friend request, because I believe the people I’ve met through the Swan, and through all of my endeavors are more than just customers, We ARE friends and in many ways, an extended family. Indiegogo has numerous share tools, please take advantage of them and let everyone who might make a difference, no matter how small, know about our campaign. I’d love to thank each of you face to face, until then please accept my heartfelt thanks.</p>

Questions</p><p><strong>Q: Why is there an uneven number of socks in a pack?</strong></p><p>A: SOLOSOCKS™ come in packs of 5 or 7 single socks that are designed to match. The socks come in an uneven number to underline the fact that there are NO PAIRS. But don’t worry. You will loose a sock eventually, and when you do you will be left with an even number!</p><p><strong>Q: I live in Copenhagen. Can I pick up my socks myself?</strong></p><p>A: No. However, we will personally deliver them to you and thank you for backing us.</p><p><strong>Q: What cotton is used for SOLOSOCKS™?</strong></p><p>A: We only use the finest GOTS-certified organic combed cotton. Combed cotton is a specially processed cotton where the short fibers of cotton are eliminated to increase the quality, softness and durability of the cotton. </p><p><strong>Q: What is a hand linked toe seam?</strong></p><p>A: The toe part of an ordinary sock is usually sewn by a sewing machine, which normally makes the toe seam thicker and inconvenient. Hand-linking is a demanding technique where each single thread on the toe and the sock foot are linked manually. It makes toe seam totally flat and comfortable. Usually, this work is done by professional workers. The paradox about the manual hand-linking technique is that it can be harmful for the professional worker’s eyes. For SOLOSOCKS™ we have chosen ultra modern Italian machines that provide machinery hand-linking. As such we managed to avoid the harm but kept the hand-linking quality.</p><p><strong>Q: Are SOLOSOCKS™ quality controlled? </strong></p><p>A: SOLOSOCKS™ undergo various quality control processes of our own and some external vendors and institutions. We choose only European certified suppliers, which means all production steps from cotton production to yarn and dying processes are periodically controlled by the relevant institutions and authorities.</p><p><strong>Q: How should I wash my SOLOSOCKS™?</strong></p><p>A: SOLOSOCKS™ are made of finest organic combed cotton. Natural cotton feels more convenient, however, demands careful treatment. Your SOLOSOCKS™ should not be washed with temperature over 40C. </p><p><strong>Q: How and where are SOLOSOCKS™ manufactured? </strong></p><p>A: SOLOSOCKS™ are produced with the state of the art Italian Lonati machines in Istanbul, the sock capital of Europe! Turkey has some of the finest combed cotton, good reliable factories, and is located in Europe. Most of the socks headed for Europe are produced there. </p><p><strong>Q: Who designed SOLOSOCKS™? </strong></p><p>A: The SOLOSOCKS™ have been designed by various talented Danish designers under Anna Sofie Weinell’s leadership. Anna Sofie is an experienced Fashion Designer with a degree from Copenhagen School of Design and Technology. </p><p><strong>Q: What kind of warranty do you offer?   </strong></p><p>A: No matter how good the quality is, socks will always be socks and eventually they will be worn out. This means that we can’t offer a warranty. We do however have a return policy. </p><p><strong>Q: What is your returns policy?</strong></p><p>A: This is the ""SOLOSOCKS-promise"": We are so confident that you will love your new SOLOSOCKS™ so much, that we offer you a 14 days’ money back guarantee after you have received them (if you are not satisfied).</p><p><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/solosocks-no-pairs-just-solos-design-fashion/payments/new?nonperk_amt=10"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486640122/kwgn3aoqlzvim4earnms.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p><p>Getting a product like this from the mind of the designer into the hands of backers involves a great deal of hard work, planning and coordination between designer, manufacturer, and logistics in order to deliver on schedule.</p><p>In recognition of this, we have been working closely with the production personnel for more than three years, refining the specifications and ironing out the technical challenges and complexities involved in transitioning from drawing board ideas to full-scale manufacturing.</p><p>We already have two collections out on the market as of now.

A Short Introduction
It’s a simple solution to a frustrating problem for parents and caretakers of young children.  It allows you to gain their attention without line of sight, or without shouting out their name; especially in noisy environments where your voice can be quickly drowned out.

The Tapping Bracelet is a small silicone bracelet (in all sorts of fun colors) that can be worn by a child. The bracelet contains a tiny vibrating motor, similar to the one in your cell phone.  The bracelet is paired with a small keychain sized remote control.  When the button on the remote is pressed, it sends a silent vibration to the bracelet, ‘tapping’ them on the wrist from a distance

The Girl Who Inspired The Tapping Bracelet
In the video, I talk about a friend who’s daughter is completely hearing impaired. Her name is Alexah. This is her ;)
She’s a rambunctious young girl who doesn’t let her exceptions keep her from enjoying her childhood to the fullest.


Endlessly Useful
The Tapping Bracelet can be used in lots of ways.  You’re bounded only by your imagination.  Here are just a few ways the Tapping Bracelet can help improve your life:
 
At The Playground
Let your kids play their hearts out on the monkey bars.  When it’s time to go; instead of yelling over the laughter, clanging of the big toy and shouts from other parents, press the button on your remote and silently let your children know to come back.  The other parent’s will think you’re psychic!
 
At The Park
Your kids start to get a little too far away for their own good.  When you realize they’re out of ear shot, you send a vibration to their wrist and let them know to come back a bit.  No more chasing them down!
 
At The Game
It gets noisy at the stadium.  Trying to call out to someone just a few rows away becomes nearly impossible.  A simple way to get someone’s attention is to tap them on the wrist, with the push of a button.  No more stepping on toes to exit your rows!
 
At The Store
You do your own thing while your (older) children do their own thing.  When it's time to go you push the button and they know it's time to meet up at a designated location.    Say goodbye to the cell phone juggling, or text message flurries!

At Home
The kids are outside playing and you want them to come inside, all you have to do is push the button on the remote and it will send a vibration to the bracelet that your child is wearing and they will know that you need them to come inside.   No more yelling out the kitchen window.  Save your breath for the food fights!

How Long Will It Take?

Because we've put in so much of the leg work already for large scale manufacturing, we can start producing bracelets as soon as funding is complete!  We can't wait to put Tapping Bracelets into the hands of those who will benefit from our technology.

<div data-caption=""Urban elastic belt compared to a traditional leather belt."" data-id=""28781952""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1598473870/b0zi3cnjlfrmzqcofoos.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Urban elastic belt compared to a traditional leather belt.</strong></p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The traditional leather belt is an age-old wardrobe staple. But, anyone who has ever worn one knows it is not without its flaws. The stiff and unforgiving material can dig into and pinch the skin. Plus, you’ll see cracks, ridges, wear and tear within days of use.</p>
<div data-caption=""Durability of a traditional belt."" data-id=""28781975""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/028/781/975/983bd3c6659327472ab6c1c5f10d3646_original.GIF?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1587319607&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=834e17d99ade849a7814c2a079d6cede"" src=""""/><figcaption><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Durability of a traditional belt</strong></p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">At Xpand, we’re all about moving smarter. We believe everyday items should work with you, not against you. That’s why we designed the Urban Belt.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The secret is in the materials. After years of testing elastic fabrics, we’ve found the perfect fit. The belt strap is made from a zero-memory elastic, meaning it won’t sag or lose its tension with wear. The tension and fit will last no matter what the day brings. Plus, you’ll hardly notice the lightweight fabric, so you can focus on what matters most.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our buckle is made from a premium plastic called, PA66 GF30. To put it simply, it is an amazing material with some awesome abilities. It is a highly durable plastic which we have put to the test to ensure we are providing our backers with nothing but the very best. Our buckle also has UV protection and weather resistant properties. We do understand that plastic is a very valuable source and should not be abused but, we have chosen this material so that your buckle is built to last! Inside the buckle are 2 N64 grade magnets. To simplify, these magnets are highly durable and provide the perfect amount of pressure to secure the buckle and be released at the users choice.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Here at Xpand we have been in the elastics game for a while now so we can tell a good elastic when we see one. The manufacturer and process we are working with are amongst the best we have ever seen and know that the product will not leave any backer feeling disappointed. Our elastic is zero-memory, meaning it will not lose its tension or start to sag after continued and constant usage. The material's stretch provides the perfect combination of security and comfort. This belt strap will blow your mind and leave you feeling like you're wearing your comfiest sweatpants.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">The standout feature of the Urban belt is its adjustment system. Using the buckle wings, the elastic belt can be held securely underneath and pulled outwardly to release and adjust in a snap.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">To re-secure, simply pinch the strap and pull underneath the wings or wiggle the strap underneath one wing at a time.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The two part magnetic buckle can be separated by sliding the front in an upwards direction or pulling the two parts away from each other.</p>
<div data-caption=""Quick release magnetic buckle."" data-id=""28817782""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1598473875/d2iu7cu1sangdxbnwxfx.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Quick-release magnetic buckle</strong></p></figcaption></figure></div>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span>Hidden Mode</span></strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Oh and did we mention that there is also a hidden way to wear the belt to avoid seeing the tail of the belt? Threading the belt from the front to the back allows you to hide the excess on the inside offering a super clean look. Also included with the belt is our excess ring which is an optional piece for you to wear to secure the excess even tighter.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Colours</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We designed the Urban belt to provide our customer with the ability to separate the buckle from the strap. With five available strap colours to choose from, you’ll find something to suit any outfit or style.</p>
<div data-id=""29855103""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1598473880/rxsyoeotxtzhum1wnqeg.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div> <p>The belt straps are available in five colours:</p>

<li><span>Navy Blazer</span></li>
<li><span>Ivy Green</span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">At Xpand we believe that everyone should have the option of creating their own style, so making a belt that the customer can customize was of the utmost importance. This is unlike existing elastic belt companies that force you to buy a whole new belt and buckle if you want a different colour.</p>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">How we did it</h1>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We started by researching and gathering all the information we could on existing products. We thought about all the ways these products fell short. Then we got to work on making them better. Our mission was simple. Create a quality elastic belt that is designed for everyone to use everyday.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We began exploring standard methods of attachment like male and female clips, or loop and hole style systems but kept running into the same problem. The belt would be difficult to adjust. The project seemed to be nearing an end when our designer made a break through. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">He put two Xpand Original No-Tie Lace Anchors back-to-back to make a double-sided version. He wrapped it around his waist and it worked as a belt. We made an upscaled 3D model and, just like that, we had a proof-of-concept. From there, Xpand’s Urban belt was born.</p>

<h1><span>FAQ</span></h1>
<ul><li><span>How much is shipping? Do you ship worldwide?</span></li></ul>
<p>The Urban will be available for Worldwide shipping. Each order comes with FREE worldwide shipping!</p>
<ul><li> <span>What do I do with the excess?</span> </li></ul>
<p>There is a sliding material ring loop that can be used to help secure the excess. Your pant belt loops are also helpful for this!</p>
<ul><li> <span>What if I'm exactly a size 30, 35 or 40?</span> </li></ul>

The Problem 
Urban elastic belt compared to a traditional leather belt.
The traditional leather belt is an age-old wardrobe staple. But, anyone who has ever worn one knows it is not without its flaws. The stiff and unforgiving material can dig into and pinch the skin. Plus, you’ll see cracks, ridges, wear and tear within days of use.
Durability of a traditional belt
At Xpand, we’re all about moving smarter. We believe everyday items should work with you, not against you. That’s why we designed the Urban Belt.
The secret is in the materials. After years of testing elastic fabrics, we’ve found the perfect fit. The belt strap is made from a zero-memory elastic, meaning it won’t sag or lose its tension with wear. The tension and fit will last no matter what the day brings. Plus, you’ll hardly notice the lightweight fabric, so you can focus on what matters most.
Secure elastic comfort Materials
Belt Buckle

Durable
 UV Protection 
 Weather Resistant 

Our buckle is made from a premium plastic called, PA66 GF30. To put it simply, it is an amazing material with some awesome abilities. It is a highly durable plastic which we have put to the test to ensure we are providing our backers with nothing but the very best. Our buckle also has UV protection and weather resistant properties. We do understand that plastic is a very valuable source and should not be abused but, we have chosen this material so that your buckle is built to last! Inside the buckle are 2 N64 grade magnets. To simplify, these magnets are highly durable and provide the perfect amount of pressure to secure the buckle and be released at the users choice.
We use only the best N64 grade magnets
Elastic Belt Straps

 Zero-memory elastic 
 Machine-washable 
 Comfort & Security 

Here at Xpand we have been in the elastics game for a while now so we can tell a good elastic when we see one. The manufacturer and process we are working with are amongst the best we have ever seen and know that the product will not leave any backer feeling disappointed. Our elastic is zero-memory, meaning it will not lose its tension or start to sag after continued and constant usage. The material's stretch provides the perfect combination of security and comfort. This belt strap will blow your mind and leave you feeling like you're wearing your comfiest sweatpants.
Elastic comfort, and security

 How it works
Normal Mode
The standout feature of the Urban belt is its adjustment system. Using the buckle wings, the elastic belt can be held securely underneath and pulled outwardly to release and adjust in a snap.
To re-secure, simply pinch the strap and pull underneath the wings or wiggle the strap underneath one wing at a time.
The two part magnetic buckle can be separated by sliding the front in an upwards direction or pulling the two parts away from each other.
Quick-release magnetic buckle
 
Hidden Mode
Oh and did we mention that there is also a hidden way to wear the belt to avoid seeing the tail of the belt? Threading the belt from the front to the back allows you to hide the excess on the inside offering a super clean look. Also included with the belt is our excess ring which is an optional piece for you to wear to secure the excess even tighter.

 
Hidden Mode - excess tucked on the inside
 
Normal Mode - excess on the outside.
 
Hidden mode, no belt excess!
 
Normal mode with the sliding excess ring
Colours
We designed the Urban belt to provide our customer with the ability to separate the buckle from the strap. With five available strap colours to choose from, you’ll find something to suit any outfit or style.
 The belt straps are available in five colours:

Black
Cool Gray
Brown Stone
Navy Blazer
Ivy Green

At Xpand we believe that everyone should have the option of creating their own style, so making a belt that the customer can customize was of the utmost importance. This is unlike existing elastic belt companies that force you to buy a whole new belt and buckle if you want a different colour.
5 colours to choose from

Versatility
At Xpand, we believe your everyday products should work harder for you. That’s why we built versatility into the Urban design. Whether you’re headed to a business meeting downtown, working from home, or a hike outside of the city, the Urban is down for the ride.

Any outfit or style you want
 Compact Design
Our elastic fabric isn’t just highly wearable, it’s also extremely compact. The Urban folds down 3x smaller than a traditional belt, making it perfect for storage and urban explorers.
 The Urban Belt packs down to be 3 times smaller than traditional belts
A clean design to take with you wherever you go

Your new golfing and everyday essential
How we did it
We started by researching and gathering all the information we could on existing products. We thought about all the ways these products fell short. Then we got to work on making them better. Our mission was simple. Create a quality elastic belt that is designed for everyone to use everyday.
We began exploring standard methods of attachment like male and female clips, or loop and hole style systems but kept running into the same problem. The belt would be difficult to adjust. The project seemed to be nearing an end when our designer made a break through. 
Original no-tie lace anchor belt prototype 1
He put two Xpand Original No-Tie Lace Anchors back-to-back to make a double-sided version. He wrapped it around his waist and it worked as a belt. We made an upscaled 3D model and, just like that, we had a proof-of-concept. From there, Xpand’s Urban belt was born.

FAQ
How much is shipping? Do you ship worldwide?

 What do I do with the excess?

<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>The Project we are looking to start is a new product line for Home Combat Magazine. We are looking to ""repurpose,"" if you will, old Military Duffel bags into new, Every Day Carry book bags. These book bags will be fully functional, and will be a huge asset in your Every Day life, whether it is carrying your lap top and files to and from work, or perhaps your lunch and books to and from school this back pack will be there for you. The bags will feature a pocket for a hydration bladder so you will always have water with you wherever you go. There will be a pocket on each one of the shoulder straps as well so that you can carry credentials right where you need them, and your cell phone too!</p>
<p>Each one of these bags will be unique, and will tell their own tale. Be it a duffel bag that has just come back from Iraq or Afghanistan, or perhaps a duffel that sat away in a veterans clsoet for many years, these bags will tell the tale of those Service Members lives. We hope, that in giving these bags new lives and new purpose, that we can share part of their history with you, and help write them a new one.</p>
<p>**UPDATE!**</p>
<p>We have now added three options for the bags, called the Basic, Standard, and Advanced models! The basic model of the bag will have no flap and side pockets, but will be $20 cheaper than the standard model! The standard model comes with the flap and side pockets, and will be estimated at $80 per bag to start, and the advanced model will have The flap, side pockets, and a hidden compartment for a concealed carry pistol, and will be $20 more than the standard bag.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need only a small sum- $750 to get started. This will allow us to purchase enough Duffel Bags, Thread, Buckles, Webbing, and Foam Support to be able to fabricate enough prototypes to send to be reviewed, tested, and ultimately judged. We are seeking to fabricate at least four prototypes to sent out to various soldiers and companies around the United States for their judgement. Once the prototypes are deemed worthy, we will be able to start full time production. As we stated in the video, the cost is very low, but we strive to only provide the best to our readers and customers. If each duffel bag costs us $20 to purchase, and the buckles, webbing, and support are another $30, that is $50 per bag to make.The $750 we seek will allow us the four protoypes, and then six production models ready for sale or donation.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: Helvetica;""></span></p>
<p>The iPhone is one of the coolest gadgets ever invented. It’s super-portable, intelligent and really puts the ‘smart’ in smart-phone. Most people who own one never go anywhere without it (and we’re talking about anywhere). The problem is that today’s’ consumer also has a ton of other stuff that they take everywhere they go as well. Cash, credit cards, keys, sunglasses and more. Wouldn’t it be convenient if, when you grabbed your iPhone on the way out of the house, everything else was already attached to it or stored with it? That would sure cut down on forgetting your most important things when you go out, wouldn’t it? That’s why we made the Tigdi, an iPhone wallet that protects your iPhone and holds all your other important stuff at the same time.</p></span><p></p>

The iPhone is one of the coolest gadgets ever invented. It’s super-portable, intelligent and really puts the ‘smart’ in smart-phone. Most people who own one never go anywhere without it (and we’re talking about anywhere). The problem is that today’s’ consumer also has a ton of other stuff that they take everywhere they go as well. Cash, credit cards, keys, sunglasses and more. Wouldn’t it be convenient if, when you grabbed your iPhone on the way out of the house, everything else was already attached to it or stored with it? That would sure cut down on forgetting your most important things when you go out, wouldn’t it? That’s why we made the Tigdi, an iPhone wallet that protects your iPhone and holds all your other important stuff at the same time.

Why the Tigdi is better:
 We studied tons of other iPhone wallets to see what we liked, what worked and, most importantly, what was missing. We looked for convenience and protection most of all and, after we were done studying the other iPhone wallets on the market, we designed the Tigdi to do everything they could do and much more.

 
Q: What is a TIGDI 1.0 & a TIGDI 2.0
  A:  The Tigdi 1.0 is a classic wallet+case. Compatible with iPhone 4/4s/5           The Tigdi 2.0 is a wallet+sleeve version which you can use like a regular wallet, or add another phone in the back. Compatible with iPhone 4/4s/5 Pictured below if the Tigdi 1.0 and 2.0



Find My iPhone = Find My Wallet=Find My things
  It’s a grab-and-go solution for your iPhone that will keep you organized, cut down on lost items and keep everything in one easy to use and ultra-convenient place.

Easy Access:
Opening up the inner wallet is a one-hand job. Answering a phone call is also a breeze. One finger take out card.

Cash and tickets：
   There is plenty of room for the storage of cash and is suitable for many country currencies and perfect place to store a ticket,

 The Tigdi of style.

It’s a wallet that looks like no other and a case that keeps your iPhone from looking like everyone else’s.

Supper Fit
The Tigdi case is a very thing fit, but never too thin to easily get lost.

Your phone is safe in a tigdi.
Protect your iPhone between two layers of genuine leather covers.It feels great in your hand.Tigdi 2.0
Material and Manufacuring

Hi!  My name is Grace Rose and aside from all my ten-year-old activities, I also design clothes.  I was born in New Orleans, Louisiana and moved to L.A. after hurricane Katrina.  I like to say that I'm from New Orleans and go to school in Los Angeles.  Since L.A. is where all my doctors are, it's important that I'm out here for clinics and to be sure that I'm staying healthy.  I have Cystic Fibrosis. 


Having CF is no fun.  I want to find a cure for me and all those who have to deal with this.  That's what made me think of creating a clothing line that gives back to Cystic Fibrosis research.  This is how I got the idea for Rosie G!

I created this clothing line based on my love of the two cities I call home.  It's ""beach meets bayou"".  I designed my first dress when I was just two-years-old with the help of my mom who's also a designer.

These two-panel dresses are great for warm weather and comfort.  I also designed them so you can be unique and choose your own style and mix up the panels - you decide which one goes on top! 

The name ""Rosie G"" came from my alter ego.  When I put on my lip gloss and get dressed up, I like to sing and dance in the mirror and I call this person Rosie G!  My doctors say that singing is really good for my lungs...lucky me!



All my clothes are super comfortable and they're all made here in the USA!



Back my new
fashion line and help create a more exciting, colorful and confident world for kids.  

Because

<h3><span style=""background-color: initial;"">What Makes R.G.B. Unique?</span></h3> <span style=""background-color: initial;"">-A Ratchet Belt</span><div>Let's look at our co-founder Lance W, 6""00 tall and waist size 42"", spend his 8 hours a day in the office.  All of his belts, the luxury dress belt, the Amish hand made belt, and R.G.B. CA King fit perfectly and tightly. Lance can carry anything on the belt, IWB, OWB, cell phone, wallet, EDCs, etc. </div>
<div>Lance always has business lunch with his colleagues and clients. After a good meal and a Starbucks double shot espresso, his effective waist size increases to 42 1/4"".  With his luxury belt and Amish belt, Lance has to either suffer from the pain of over tightness if he sticks to the 42"" hole, or walk around the office with his saggy pants if he relax the belt to the 43"" hole. R.G.B. solves this problem by using the ratchet system to achieve the 1/4"" adjustment. With a simple click, Lance can adjust R.G.B. to 42 1/4"" and keep focusing on the important things instead of his pants.</div>

<h3>-A Reinforced Belt</h3>
<div>Lance W, loves all his 3 belts and wear them in turn. His EDCs and CCW are quite heavy and as a result, his luxury belt and Amish belt die after 7 months of daily usage. The Amish belt become saggy and stretched. The luxury belt is completely folded over. R.G.B.  survives by reinforcing the leather with another layer of ""liquid steel"" polymer. See how solid R.G.B. is after the reinforcement, it can even carry 3 people standing on top!</div> <a href=""http://s58.photobucket.com/user/wang2yn84/media/ezgif.com-video-to-gif_zpsoxym74f3.gif.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""R.G.B. hold 3 people photo ezgif.com-video-to-gif_zpsoxym74f3.gif"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g263/wang2yn84/ezgif.com-video-to-gif_zpsoxym74f3.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></a><h3> </h3>

What Makes R.G.B. Unique? -A Ratchet BeltLet's look at our co-founder Lance W, 6""00 tall and waist size 42"", spend his 8 hours a day in the office.  All of his belts, the luxury dress belt, the Amish hand made belt, and R.G.B. CA King fit perfectly and tightly. Lance can carry anything on the belt, IWB, OWB, cell phone, wallet, EDCs, etc. 
Lance always has business lunch with his colleagues and clients. After a good meal and a Starbucks double shot espresso, his effective waist size increases to 42 1/4"".  With his luxury belt and Amish belt, Lance has to either suffer from the pain of over tightness if he sticks to the 42"" hole, or walk around the office with his saggy pants if he relax the belt to the 43"" hole. R.G.B. solves this problem by using the ratchet system to achieve the 1/4"" adjustment. With a simple click, Lance can adjust R.G.B. to 42 1/4"" and keep focusing on the important things instead of his pants.
 

 

 
 


 
-A Reinforced Belt
Lance W, loves all his 3 belts and wear them in turn. His EDCs and CCW are quite heavy and as a result, his luxury belt and Amish belt die after 7 months of daily usage. The Amish belt become saggy and stretched. The luxury belt is completely folded over. R.G.B.  survives by reinforcing the leather with another layer of ""liquid steel"" polymer. See how solid R.G.B. is after the reinforcement, it can even carry 3 people standing on top!  
-A Reinforced Ratchet Belt
This is R.G.B.! Decent as a dress belt, solid as a carry belt!

</div></div>","A Fashion Essential
In the City of London, on the pulse of the time, we developed a special fabric for our pocket squares that represent the merger between fashion and functionality. Every pocket square is two sided, one side is formal, the other one will style your casual look. Wherever you go, to the office or for afterwork drinks, this revolutionary pocket square has it all.What is more, our unique fabric enables you to clean the surface of your electronic devices easily. You can wear it on you - in a classy way. Remember, the difference is always in the detail!
This petite piece of fabric can express your personality without having to purchase an entire closet worth of different suits. Our unique designs allow you to adjust your style to any occasion. For men there are just two possibilities to stand out from the crowd: Either a nice wristwatch or a smart pocket square. Since we are no watchmakers...the latter it shall be!

The Fabric

Our pocket squares are made from a unique material that we call TONY, which we developed after conducting extensive research. Through our dedication to perfection we managed to combine two often controversial features - function and aesthetics. As a result, our smart pocket squares are capable of cleaning your smartphone, tablet or any other delicate surface. Your electronic devices and sunglasses need a cleaning several times a day, using a specifically developed fabric, our pocket squares can easily wipe away unwanted distraction from your screens. Their elegant design compliments your outfit at the same time - all in one. We use just the finest and most elegant materials and with our eye for detail we craft the most stylish piece of accessory.




The Perfect Gift
Each pocket square is designed with passion and attention to detail and wrapped in an elegant packaging because a revolutionary product deserves an outstanding presentation as well. It is important for us that the overall picture gives you the feeling of durability when you first get your hands on it. Therefore, our pocket squares represent the perfect gift for your beloved ones.

The Story Behind The Campaign



Our team was formed at Cass Business School where we decided to start up a business and develop a stylish product that would represent a merger between two crucial things essential for a person living in an urban environment. In our case, combining fashion and functionality was a challenge - and we were eager to accept it. In large cities it is sometimes hard to stand out of the crowd and you never know what the current day may bring. So after days and nights of nerve-racking discussions we found a solution by launching a product that we, and also our friends and colleagues, were excited about. Due to close contacts to the textile industry we are able to have our hands on the product from the very first moment, starting from development and production until the delivery to your doorstep.

<strong><span style=""color: dodgerblue;"">BlueFox is the world's first automatic electronic safety bracelet that helps prevent drowning.</span></strong> <br/>
</h3><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The BlueFox bracelet is fully automatic and consists of 2 main
components that are mounted on a bracelet: an electronic base and an alarm
module. The permanent measurement of depth and time in the water makes the
bracelet a personal protector for swimmers of all ages. In an emergency
situation – in this case the pre-programmed parameters of depth and time are
exceeded – the alarm module will be disconnected from the bracelet and a
balloon that instantly inflates (filling with gas) is forced to the water’s surface.
Right after the alarm module with the balloon has reached the surface it alerts
people in and around the water with a very loud (100 dB) acoustic signal. When
using BlueFox in public/commercial pools, the alarm-signal from the
Balloon can be sent to an external receiver unit and then the alarm can be transferred to
any existing alarm system or to a
Walkie-Talkie.</p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456934065/nwegzaxlvnxklucei4vq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></span></p><p>BlueFox can be programmed individually depending on the
swimming ability or the age of a person. For example: the programming
parameters of the bracelet for a six-year-old non-swimmer might be 1.6 ft.
(50 cm)/15 sec. An alarm will be released as soon as the child exceeds the
preset depth (counted from the water-surface) and a duration of 15 seconds. For
an adult or experienced swimmer, the parameters will be set at a higher level, for
example 2.6 ft. (80 cm) and a longer duration of maybe 20 seconds. This allows
the swimmer to jump into the water, to dive, to swim laps etc. without getting
a false alarm. Whereas if you want to protect a toddler who should not even be
close to the water, the unit will be programmed with 5cm/5 seconds which
ensures that an alarm will be triggered immediately when the toddler falls into
the water. BlueFox is developed and produced in Switzerland and carries the
label: <strong style=""background-color: initial;"">SWISS MADE</strong><span style=""background-color: initial;"">. </span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The technology of BlueFox is protected by a  </span><strong style=""background-color: initial;"">worldwide patent application. </strong></p><p><strong style=""background-color: initial;"">                     <strong>Example Programming of BlueFox 50 cm / 15 seconds:</strong></strong></p><p><strong style=""background-color: initial;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446113034/kxlcflurfcueocznxfrw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p><div>

</div></div>","BlueFox is the world's first automatic electronic safety bracelet that helps prevent drowning. 
The BlueFox bracelet is fully automatic and consists of 2 main
components that are mounted on a bracelet: an electronic base and an alarm
module. The permanent measurement of depth and time in the water makes the
bracelet a personal protector for swimmers of all ages. In an emergency
situation – in this case the pre-programmed parameters of depth and time are
exceeded – the alarm module will be disconnected from the bracelet and a
balloon that instantly inflates (filling with gas) is forced to the water’s surface.
Right after the alarm module with the balloon has reached the surface it alerts
people in and around the water with a very loud (100 dB) acoustic signal. When
using BlueFox in public/commercial pools, the alarm-signal from the
Balloon can be sent to an external receiver unit and then the alarm can be transferred to
any existing alarm system or to a
Walkie-Talkie. BlueFox can be programmed individually depending on the
swimming ability or the age of a person. For example: the programming
parameters of the bracelet for a six-year-old non-swimmer might be 1.6 ft.
(50 cm)/15 sec. An alarm will be released as soon as the child exceeds the
preset depth (counted from the water-surface) and a duration of 15 seconds. For
an adult or experienced swimmer, the parameters will be set at a higher level, for
example 2.6 ft. (80 cm) and a longer duration of maybe 20 seconds. This allows
the swimmer to jump into the water, to dive, to swim laps etc. without getting
a false alarm. Whereas if you want to protect a toddler who should not even be
close to the water, the unit will be programmed with 5cm/5 seconds which
ensures that an alarm will be triggered immediately when the toddler falls into
the water. BlueFox is developed and produced in Switzerland and carries the
label: SWISS MADE. The technology of BlueFox is protected by a  worldwide patent application.                      Example Programming of BlueFox 50 cm / 15 seconds:

Why did we develop the BlueFox ST1 anti-drowning bracelet?
With BlueFox we want to help prevent drowning and near-drowning by giving an early alarm when somebody is in trouble. Drowning is not the violent, splashing, call for help that most people expect. Drowning is almost always a deceptively quiet, silent and invisible event. The waving, splashing, and yelling that dramatic conditioning (television) prepares us to look for is rarely seen in real life. Drowning is the second leading cause of accidental injury-related death among children ages 1 to 14, with a lot of drowning accidents happening close to parents or other adults. The problem is being able to recognize in time when somebody is drowning. Not only can children drown, it can happen to anybody in the water, even professional swimmers.

But keep in mind, BlueFox is intended to complement lifeguards, not replace them or reduce their responsibilities or vigilance. BlueFox does not save people from drowning – lifeguards do. Under no circumstances should the presence or use of BlueFox result in the reduction or modification of lifeguard staffing or duties as required by regulation or normal practices.

</p><p>Reusable
Bag with SafeSak liners</p>
<p>Hi, I live in Austin Texas and like many
other cities in the world, city leaders have been trying different ways to deal
with the number one consumer item in the world, plastic grocery bags. In the
United States we use <b><i>~100 Billion </i></b>one time use <b>plastic
grocery bags every year </b>and with only 2% recycled coupled with
estimated 400 years to break down each one, they have become a huge problem.
Some cities are dealing with the problem by banning their use outright or
attempting to collect a deposit for each plastic grocery bag used. Other cities
have attempted to encourage the use of reusable bags which has created the
potential for unwanted contamination inside those bags. Recent Universities of
Arizona and Pennsylvania studies have found in random inspections of reusable
grocery bags, that several types of bacteria were present
including Salmonella &amp; E-coli bacteria. SafeSak's do not allow for any
cross contamination and they biodegrade without leaving any hazardous chemicals
in the soil.</p>
<p>I am going to use the Indiegogo funding (which
after Rewards should be about half of what was raised) to refine the bag design
and order the final version of the SafeSak. I will also redesign the clips and
tailor marketing and promotional material to store requirements I plan on
rapidly expanding the brand while testing customer satisfaction results in
concert with a large national grocery chain while developing better pricing on
the bags themselves. SafeSak is protected by the US Patent and international
offices but I may add to those with a redesign of the clips. My goal is to have
SafeSak in a store near you by 1st quarter 2014.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>PREFACE</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Rape is about as wrong as it gets. The only one responsible for a rape is the rapist and AR Wear will not solve the fundamental problem that rape exists in our world. Only by raising awareness and education, as well as bringing rapists to justice, can we all hope to eventually accomplish the goal of eliminating rape as a threat to both women and men. Meanwhile, as long as sexual predators continue to populate our world, AR Wear would like to provide products to women and girls that will offer better protection against some attempted rapes while the work of changing society's rape culture moves forward.<br/></p>
<h3>OUR STORY         <br/>
</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">         **Please refer to ""Updates"" for additional information posted since campaign launch**</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">      **NOTE: While we have reached our goal, we are appreciative of all additional donations**<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We developed this product so that women and girls could have more power to control the outcome of a sexual assault. We wanted to offer some peace of mind in situations that cause feelings of apprehension, such as going out on a blind date, taking an evening run, “clubbing”, traveling in unfamiliar countries, and any other activity that might make one anxious about the possibility of an assault.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Although we believe that self-defense skills can help to resist an attempted assault, they cannot be used in all situations and will not always be effective. Other tools of self-defense currently available are also not effective in many common settings of sexual assault. Products such as pepper spray, tear gas, stun guns, etc. require that the potential victim be very alert and might be taken away to use against her.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We read <a href=""http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/3925/4925HomeComputer/Rape%20myths/10-Year%20Update.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">studies</a> reviewing the statistics of resisting assault, whether by forceful or non-forceful means. We learned that resistance increases the chance of avoiding a completed rape without making the victim more likely to be physically injured. We concluded that an item of clothing that creates an effective barrier layer can allow women and girls to passively resist an attacker, in addition to any other form of resistance they may be able to carry out at the time of an assault.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/113908/files/20131005002037-2.jpg?1380957637"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our goal is to offer a wide range of wearable items, which will include assorted types and styles of underwear, running shorts, traveling shorts, etc., suitable for different situations and the styles of individual users. The challenge was to design products that can be worn comfortably while still being able to frustrate an assault effectively. The garments must be very difficult for someone else to remove by either force or stealth (in situations where the victim cannot resist because she has had too much to drink, was drugged, or is asleep).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">They need to be resistant to pulling, tearing and cutting while being comfortable to wear during normal activities and, as in the case of underwear, fit smoothly under form-fitting outer clothing</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/113917/files/20131005002328-6.JPG?1380957808"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Since we did not find a single material that fulfilled these requirements, our solution was to strengthen specific elements of our garments using an innovative skeletal structure which allows them to remain soft and ergonomic. The waist, thighs, and central panels are protected with specially designed, cut resistant straps and webbing. Once the waist girth has been adjusted and secured with its unique locking device, the garment cannot be pulled down. Since a female’s waist measurement is generally less than that of her pelvic area, the waist strap can be locked at a comfortable position and still prevent unwanted removal of the garment. The thigh straps, after an initial adjustment by the wearer, prevent the leg openings from being lifted or shifted to the sides by someone else. The center panels are connected to both the waist and thigh straps to create a unified protective skeletal structure.</p>
<p></p>

<h3>WHY ARE WE ON INDIEGOGO?</h3>
<p>We are here for several reasons:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">- We need your financial support so that we can finalize prototypes that can be production ready.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">- We need to know that other people believe that this product line should exist.</p>

AR Wear - A clothing line offering wearable protection for when things go wrong.



PREFACE
Rape is about as wrong as it gets. The only one responsible for a rape is the rapist and AR Wear will not solve the fundamental problem that rape exists in our world. Only by raising awareness and education, as well as bringing rapists to justice, can we all hope to eventually accomplish the goal of eliminating rape as a threat to both women and men. Meanwhile, as long as sexual predators continue to populate our world, AR Wear would like to provide products to women and girls that will offer better protection against some attempted rapes while the work of changing society's rape culture moves forward.
OUR STORY         

         **Please refer to ""Updates"" for additional information posted since campaign launch**
      **NOTE: While we have reached our goal, we are appreciative of all additional donations**
We developed this product so that women and girls could have more power to control the outcome of a sexual assault. We wanted to offer some peace of mind in situations that cause feelings of apprehension, such as going out on a blind date, taking an evening run, “clubbing”, traveling in unfamiliar countries, and any other activity that might make one anxious about the possibility of an assault.
Although we believe that self-defense skills can help to resist an attempted assault, they cannot be used in all situations and will not always be effective. Other tools of self-defense currently available are also not effective in many common settings of sexual assault. Products such as pepper spray, tear gas, stun guns, etc. require that the potential victim be very alert and might be taken away to use against her.
We read studies reviewing the statistics of resisting assault, whether by forceful or non-forceful means. We learned that resistance increases the chance of avoiding a completed rape without making the victim more likely to be physically injured. We concluded that an item of clothing that creates an effective barrier layer can allow women and girls to passively resist an attacker, in addition to any other form of resistance they may be able to carry out at the time of an assault.






Our goal is to offer a wide range of wearable items, which will include assorted types and styles of underwear, running shorts, traveling shorts, etc., suitable for different situations and the styles of individual users. The challenge was to design products that can be worn comfortably while still being able to frustrate an assault effectively. The garments must be very difficult for someone else to remove by either force or stealth (in situations where the victim cannot resist because she has had too much to drink, was drugged, or is asleep).
They need to be resistant to pulling, tearing and cutting while being comfortable to wear during normal activities and, as in the case of underwear, fit smoothly under form-fitting outer clothing



Since we did not find a single material that fulfilled these requirements, our solution was to strengthen specific elements of our garments using an innovative skeletal structure which allows them to remain soft and ergonomic. The waist, thighs, and central panels are protected with specially designed, cut resistant straps and webbing. Once the waist girth has been adjusted and secured with its unique locking device, the garment cannot be pulled down. Since a female’s waist measurement is generally less than that of her pelvic area, the waist strap can be locked at a comfortable position and still prevent unwanted removal of the garment. The thigh straps, after an initial adjustment by the wearer, prevent the leg openings from being lifted or shifted to the sides by someone else. The center panels are connected to both the waist and thigh straps to create a unified protective skeletal structure.



WHY ARE WE ON INDIEGOGO?
We are here for several reasons:
- We need your financial support so that we can finalize prototypes that can be production ready.
- We need to know that other people believe that this product line should exist.
We feel very strongly about women’s safety and believe that we have successfully combined technology and fashion to help solve a problem that has not been adequately addressed in our society. We hope to work with organizations that combat violence against women and which offer support to those who have been violated.
No product alone can solve the problem of violence against women. Nevertheless, a woman or girl who is wearing one of our garments will be sending a clear message to her would-be assailant that she is NOT consenting. We believe that this undeniable message can help to prevent a significant number of rapes.
REWARDS
We have agonized over the subject of rewards for our supporters. We cannot in good conscience predict when our garments will be in production (see ""Forecast & Challenges”) so feel that it would be unrealistic to offer the actual product as a reward. July 2014 (listed as our estimated delivery date) is when we hope to have our final prototype ready. Other customary rewards, such as key chains, stickers, t-shirts or hats, seem inappropriate considering the seriousness of our message and product line. We hope that our supporters will agree that all funds raised here should go towards making this project a success, rather than spending a portion on unrelated rewards, so that we can launch a product line that will let women and girls, as well as concerned loved ones, worry less and feel more secure.
FORECAST & CHALLENGES  
After several years of research, development, and testing, we have submitted a patent application and produced prototypes of the designs presented in our video. These are “concept prototypes”. Our next step, which we are hoping to fund here, is to finalize prototypes that are production-ready, while we simultaneously continue to develop additional styles and variations.

The way it works is that each Radiation Shield™ product is embedded with a lead metal layer, which <strong>acts as a blocking agent against dangers electromagnetic waves</strong>. Another product which uses Lead, is an Xray apron which the doctors make you wear while performing an Xray on your body, so your body won’t get exposed to harmful rays. The Radiation Shield™ patent pending technology works exactly in the same way. So while you store your smartphone in your pocket have the Radiation Shield™ Case installed on your smartphone. Make sure that the case side is sitting inside your pocket,  closer to your body side, to maximize the Radiation Shield™ efficiency. This way the screen side is towards the outside surrounding, which still enables cellphone reception to take place, but clock that radiation from your body side.<br/>On top of the lead layer there is another clear layer is embedded on top of the lead layer to avoid direct contact with the lead layer. In simpler words, <strong>the lead layer keeps radiation away from you and clear layer keeps led layer away from you</strong>. Despite of the presence of two layers in this case, it does not cause your smart gadget to stop sending or receiving data. In simpler words, you can use or work on your smart gadget behind double protective layers without any problem. Moreover, <strong>the Radiation Shield™ doesn’t have any harmful effect on the performance of your smart gadget</strong>. Your smart gadget will work with normal speed.</p><h3><strong>The Radiation Shield Dual Function </strong></h3><p>Radiation Shield serves 2 functional purposes. The main purpose of this smart gadget case is to block hazardous radiations. <strong>The Radiation Shield™ redistributes electromagnetic waves and sends them away from your body.</strong> It doesn’t interfere with the signals and your smart gadget’s antenna continues to work normally.<br/>The secondary purpose, and not less important is that it can be used as a regular smart gadget case, as it protects your gadgets from daily grind and the occasional falls to the floor.</p><h3>

Inspired
by an alternative way of life, modern Pinups and the spirit of a real rebel the name, which is a neologism
of the words “ADORABLE“ and “REBEL”, came up.



After
numerous creations finally our graceful STALLION
was born. The STALLION represents the spirit of ADOREBEL. It stands for an
alternative lifestyle and exceptional people who are passionate to express
their wild side. 
ADOREBEL
is a sense of life representing freedom, self-will and authenticity. 
For
the starting phase we designed three T-Shirts which give a first impression of what
you can expect for the future.
Since it is important to us that our clothes are
manufactured under human conditions we decided to produce our Tees with
controlled and certified manufacturers.STALLION V1 - UNTAMED FORCE


The ""STALLION V1"" is an expressive V-Neck Tee made of fine cotton, refined with our ADOREBEL Logo of high-quality soft flock on the breast and a flocked ADOREBEL letterng on the left arm.

We reveiced the most brilliant result at all Pin-up T-Shirts with high resolution and wthout a foreign body feeling through the combination of synthetic fibre and sublimation print.
ADOREBEL T-SHIRTS ARE UNISEX!

The authenticity of our Pin-up T-Shirts is guaranteed by a
special code in the neck bend and a laser engraving in a high-quality dog tag.
ADOREBEL DOG TAG

Each Pin-up T-Shirt includes a DOG TAG made of stainless steel which is engraved with a unique code, our ADOREBEL lettering and the prominent Logo.The code is your guarantee, that only the stated amount of the chosen design had been produced.If you chose the DOG TAG Perk solely, you will get it without the unique code, which refers to the associated Pin-up T-Shirt, but only with the ADOREBEL Lettering on the one side and the Logo on the other.

Slickynotes are brightly colored, thin sheets of double-sided paper. Use any writing instrument on the colored side (just like traditional sticky notes) or flip to use with a dry erase marker! Erase and reuse as often as you like: one pad of Slickynotes lasts much longer than the old stickynotes. They're good for your wallet and for the Earth. </p><p></p><p>Now you can have a whiteboard anywhere. Slickynotes stick to
smooth surfaces like glass, doors, desks, wallpaper, drywall and more. Their stable
electrostatic charge lets them stick for weeks (not just minutes or hours), but
because they’re not made with harmful glues or adhesives, they’re also incredibly
easy to slide around your work surface.

</div></div>","Meet the first innovation in sticky notes in over 40 years! Slickynotes are brightly colored, thin sheets of double-sided paper. Use any writing instrument on the colored side (just like traditional sticky notes) or flip to use with a dry erase marker! Erase and reuse as often as you like: one pad of Slickynotes lasts much longer than the old stickynotes. They're good for your wallet and for the Earth. Now you can have a whiteboard anywhere. Slickynotes stick to
smooth surfaces like glass, doors, desks, wallpaper, drywall and more. Their stable
electrostatic charge lets them stick for weeks (not just minutes or hours), but
because they’re not made with harmful glues or adhesives, they’re also incredibly
easy to slide around your work surface. Slickynotes move as fast as your ideas!                  With $10K, we’ll purchase a printer that will let us add
color to the paper in house and reduce production costs by 40%. Printing in
house will also let us reduce the retail cost of Slickynotes, making them more
affordable. Our mission is to make sure everyone can upgrade their old sticky
notes to a product that is environmental friendly, innovative and
reusable. My name is Nelson Pizarro. I founded EcoStatic, Inc. with my
children because we wanted to make Slickynotes as an eco-friendly alternative
to sticky notes. Slickynotes are made right here in the United States, and our
family-run company is committed social, environmental and economic
sustainability. 
Socially, we pay our employees a fair, living wage and
provide above-standard benefits. In addition, we’re committed to sharing our
expertise and financial success in the communities across our commodity
chains. Environmentally, we source our products from environmentally
responsible manufacturers, foster the recycling of our products and promote
sustainable business practices everywhere we do business. Economically, we
strive to price our products to make them broadly accessible, while providing
the income necessary to meet our commitments to our families and those of our
employees—all while investing in the future of our business.                                                       

Slickynotes are double sided, reusable on one side and come in all shapes and sizes. Slickynotes can be used with any writing implement and will stick to any smooth, dry surface. Slickynotes have a stable electrostatic charge that lasts for days. You can stick, re-stick and slide them around. 













Shipping within the United States has been included within the
perk cost. International shipping will be calculated depending on your
location. Towards the end of the campaign we will be reaching out to our wonderful international customers and sending them the estimated shipping cost for their
purchase.

Get a FREE pair of Sets when you share this campaign with your friends! Details here





Sets are custom sunglasses with interchangeable side arms and are guaranteed for life.  The unique design of our frames allow you to quickly and easily change color combinations to customize your sunglasses however you want, whenever you want.

Our classic frame style comes with polarized lenses and is offered at a special
Indiegogo campaign price of $45 with free U.S. shipping.  Pre-order your very
first pair of Sets today by selecting from one of our perks to the right!













Our quick release, stainless steel hinge design allows
you to change color combinations in a matter of seconds to
customize your sunglasses for any situation.  No tools required - changing
side arms is done with the push of a button. 










We designed Sets with everyone in mind: Want to own the
perfect pair of sunglasses to match any outfit?  Want to show support for your favorite sports team through a great
pair of sunglasses?  Simply want to have
the freedom to create the perfect pair of sunglasses without
having to spend a fortune?  Sets has you
covered with just one pair and your choice of side arm colors.  



We spent more than one year sourcing
materials from around the world until we found the perfect combination to
create a durable, reliable pair of sunglasses with the versatility to customize them again and again.






The Hinge: Made from stainless steel and has the polished look of a standard sunglasses hinge yet gives you the
freedom to detach and change side arm colors. 
The Frames: We use a high quality injection
molded polycarbonate material that creates a durable, lightweight frame.  Our 100% original, classic frame style is
inspired by the Wayfarer design and gives you the look and feel you’d
expect from higher priced sunglasses.
The Lenses: Polarized and UV 400
protection lets you see the world in rich, vivid colors while protecting your
eyes from harmful UV light.  We also
included a dual-sided scratch resistant coating to protect your Sets from any
of life’s adventures.
Simply put, Sets are built to last and designed to go
wherever you may take them. And the best part, every pair of Sets
comes with a lifetime guarantee.


  


Sets' Indiegogo launch collection offers 12 frames in unisex
fit and 12 different interchangeable side colors.  Every pair of Sets
purchased on Indiegogo comes with at least one additional pair of side arms to
ensure you can create your perfect look.
You will choose your color combinations at the end of the campaign.  We can customize lens color on any frame for only $5 more.  


We're committed to giving back to ocean conservation efforts around the globe, and believe strongly in our mission.  Every pair purchased helps to protect and save vital marine life,  such as sea turtles, dolphins, sharks, and whales.

1) Choose from one of the perks on the right to pre-order Sets at the special Indiegogo discount price.

FabLab Hub has also worked with Cameron Naramore who writes for 3DPrinter.net.  Cameron is wheelchair-bound and has been trying to use 3D Printing to make robotic arms.  And then there is the inspiring story of Raul Krauthausen, shown below, who 3D Printed portable ramps for his wheelchair.  Raul is just one example of how Digital Fabrication represents the Democratization of Manufacturing, giving opportunity to everyone.So, we just knew we had to help get 3D Printers, supplies, scanners, and other tools to these awesome makers!  That's where you come in!What We Need & What You GetHere's what we're going to do...FabLab Hub will raise funds to buy as much as we can in printers, suppliers, 3D Scanners and other tools for these inspiring makers.  We have local FabLabs that can serve as facilitators and provide space where needed.Our first goal is to get Mike Norton in Maine, who we mentioned above, a Desktop 3D Printer and some material.  We'd also supply training, and if we raise enough funds, perhaps a 3D Scanner.  How sophisticated a machine we can purchase will be dependent upon how much we raise.  We're thinking at a minimum it will cost us $3,000 to outfit Mike properly, train him, and give him enough material to be able to print for 6 months.Then we'd like to use the balance of the funds to help Cameron Naramore with his robotic arm R&D project.  Other makers are also in the wings!Any amount we raise can get these special makers started, but the higher the amount, the more people we can help!Special RewardsWhile all our rewards are great, we wanted to talk a little bit about these special rewards.Mike Norton WheelChair People Buttons         Whether the Angel, Weed Smoker, Wedding Couple, Wounded Warrior, Warrior King, or other fun image, you're sure to find 2 Buttons right for your message!$25 REWARD:  eBook3D PRINTING FOR THE REST OF USEver felt like getting into 3D Printing is too complicated to understand?  We know how you feel.  Although we've worked in Digital Fabrication since 1986, we do a lot of workshops and have seen how intimidating some of the work, especially CAD, can be to anyone new to 3D Printing.  But no more! Anybody off the street can jump into 3D Printing with some simple projects, and then refine skills as you progress.Here's the Table of Contents of the 150 page eBook:

<p class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">We added a store credit perk so that you can use it towards purchasing future dress designs when we have more options and size choices.</p>
<p class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>THE DREAM:</strong></span><strong> </strong>Three summers ago, I sat on the beach skimming through an old magazine. I flipped to a page where I discovered the story of Eileen Fisher's company and learned that she started her clothing line with a mere $350 and a driven heart. It was in that very moment that I felt stirring in my heart to chase after my dreams of designing a line of dresses for girls. I have spent the last three years studying different dress designs, trends, color combinations, and styles.</p>
<p class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">WHY DRESSES?</span>: </strong>For as long as I can remember, I spent many days of my childhood running barefoot through the grass wearing dresses and hair bows. There was always something so comforting about the breeze blowing and the joy and giggles I had. I recall spending many long hours twirling as I watched my dress spin and dance in the wind. </p>
<div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;"">
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">MY MISSION:</span> </strong>I currently make and sell hair accessories for girls + wedding parties in my studio in North Carolina, but would love to follow my dreams and expand the line to dresses. I carefully selected a company that would be able to create my designs with care and love. Each dress is handmade using beautiful fabric and of the utmost high quality. I wanted to ensure that these dresses would last for many hours of outdoor play, laughter, and twirling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>THE DRESSES:</strong></span></p>
<p>I have designed four different dresses each available in different sizes. The dresses are ONLY available in the sizes that are listed. IF for some reason, this ends up exceeding the necessary funds, there is a possibility each dress will be available in more sizes.</p>

</div></div>","**an update** 
We added a store credit perk so that you can use it towards purchasing future dress designs when we have more options and size choices.
THE DREAM: Three summers ago, I sat on the beach skimming through an old magazine. I flipped to a page where I discovered the story of Eileen Fisher's company and learned that she started her clothing line with a mere $350 and a driven heart. It was in that very moment that I felt stirring in my heart to chase after my dreams of designing a line of dresses for girls. I have spent the last three years studying different dress designs, trends, color combinations, and styles.
WHY DRESSES?: For as long as I can remember, I spent many days of my childhood running barefoot through the grass wearing dresses and hair bows. There was always something so comforting about the breeze blowing and the joy and giggles I had. I recall spending many long hours twirling as I watched my dress spin and dance in the wind. 

MY MISSION: I currently make and sell hair accessories for girls + wedding parties in my studio in North Carolina, but would love to follow my dreams and expand the line to dresses. I carefully selected a company that would be able to create my designs with care and love. Each dress is handmade using beautiful fabric and of the utmost high quality. I wanted to ensure that these dresses would last for many hours of outdoor play, laughter, and twirling.
 
THE DRESSES:
I have designed four different dresses each available in different sizes. The dresses are ONLY available in the sizes that are listed. IF for some reason, this ends up exceeding the necessary funds, there is a possibility each dress will be available in more sizes.
 

 

 
The Katy comes with a polka dot/baby pink gem clip or a pink polka dot basic bow. If needed, it will come on a croquet headband.
 

 
The Stacey comes with a polka dot/baby pink gem clip or a basic white bow. If needed, it will come with a croquet headband.

 
 
 
The Kate comes with either a green/pink gem clip or green polka dot basic bow.
 


 

 
The Cheryl comes with either a baby pink/white gem clip or a white basic bow. 
 

YOUR CONTRIBUTION: The money that you donate to this project will go directly toward funding the first line of dresses. Each of the four dresses is a sample I received that I carefully studied and examined to ensure that its high quality and durable . Since I started as a handmade accessory designer, I am committed to ensuring that each dress is 100% handmade with love and care.
I CAN ONLY DO IT WITH YOUR HELP! Your donations will cover the costs of getting the the first batch of dresses produced, where I’ll send them to you!
While the line will only start with the four dresses shown above; there are a few more dresses designs in the works. So the more money=the more dress designs.
This is where you come in! I would love for your daughters or the special little girls in your life to be the first to wear my products and be a part of my story. But more than that, I would love for you to be a part of my journey towards making this dream a reality. Anything you can help to get the word out there would mean the world to me!

<b>Zachary Howell with Zachary/Nathaniel    </b>
</div><p>Zachary Howell was born and raised in Raleigh,
NC. With Southern roots he grew up in the pageant environment. His sister was a
huge influence on his design career. After he saw his sister’s wedding dress go
from sketch to reality, he knew then that being a designer was his dream.
Zachary pursued his dreams by going to Savannah College of Art and Design.
After graduating in November of 2013, he has shown as FW ’14 collection at
Charleston Fashion Week as an emerging designer. Now a day he is doing personal
clientele work as well as designing his FW’15 collection as well as building his
business in Savannah, GA where he calls home. </p><div>
<p>Zachary
Howell's attributed design philosophy can easily be described as a Dark
Paradise. Taking influence and inspiration from various psychoses of the mind,
and dysfunctions that twist the norms into their exaggerated forms. Twisting
seamed lines around the body, his specific brand of evening wear finds itself
emerging from the locked away secrets, kept hidden from the rest of world. A
woman twisted from her Bacchic excesses is his muse, she exists within her own
world centered within the comforts of the world known to the majority. </p>
<p>For
this collection Zachary, introspectively, referenced his interests in
tragedies, and traumatic instances in history that have shaped many
psychological archetypes in the human mind. <a href=""http://www.zacharynathaniel.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.zacharynathaniel.com</a></p>

Our Project includes five extremely talented designers that have an opportunity of a lifetime.  Each designer has taken their own path to this current crossroad.  Each have their own unique style.  They are ready for the next step in their careers.  The opportunity is available, wrapped in ribbon, but it's up to you to help make Paris Fashion Week a true reality...their Christmas morning.Your contribution will assist with:

Meet Your Designers  

Zachary Howell with Zachary/Nathaniel    
Zachary Howell was born and raised in Raleigh,
NC. With Southern roots he grew up in the pageant environment. His sister was a
huge influence on his design career. After he saw his sister’s wedding dress go
from sketch to reality, he knew then that being a designer was his dream.
Zachary pursued his dreams by going to Savannah College of Art and Design.
After graduating in November of 2013, he has shown as FW ’14 collection at
Charleston Fashion Week as an emerging designer. Now a day he is doing personal
clientele work as well as designing his FW’15 collection as well as building his
business in Savannah, GA where he calls home. 
Zachary
Howell's attributed design philosophy can easily be described as a Dark
Paradise. Taking influence and inspiration from various psychoses of the mind,
and dysfunctions that twist the norms into their exaggerated forms. Twisting
seamed lines around the body, his specific brand of evening wear finds itself
emerging from the locked away secrets, kept hidden from the rest of world. A
woman twisted from her Bacchic excesses is his muse, she exists within her own
world centered within the comforts of the world known to the majority. 
For
this collection Zachary, introspectively, referenced his interests in
tragedies, and traumatic instances in history that have shaped many
psychological archetypes in the human mind. www.zacharynathaniel.com

Each pocket watch has been named after a Royal Flying Corps airfield used during the First World War.Named after the Royal Flying Corp's airfield in Doncaster, Yorkshire. The Lufbery Doncaster has a brushed stainless steel case and a white dial.Named after the Royal Flying Corp's airfield in Montrose, Scotland. The Lufbery Montrose has a matte black case and a black dial.Named after the Royal Flying Corps airfield at Shoreham, on the south coast of England.

</div><p><b>My Story</b></p>
<p>Have you ever thought how your designed suite dress or pants was
born and made, or who created it and how? Maybe you did, more likely you did
not. Like everything else, there is a story behind it. And it is not a pretty
one,</p>
<p>For a few years, I was the
CEO of a fashion &amp; retail company. I was surprised to see that the people
in charge for fashion designing are far away from the glamour of the fashion world,
as I would expect. They were more like the back stage workers rather than the
actors on the stage. For me it came as a surprise. Fashion designers do the
hard work behind the curtain but on numerous occasions receive no credit.  </p>
<p>It turns out that being a
fashion designer is much more than difficult than you might imagine. Young designers
spend most of their time fighting for their professional and business survival.
Not glamorous at all.</p>
<p>Over time, I met many designers,
all young, talented and very passionate about their work struggling to survive
with limited chances if any. <b><i>At some point, it hit me - there is a market
failure in the fashion market, one that no one cares about.</i></b></p>
<p><b>Like climbing the
Everest </b></p>
<p>Being a designer is not a
conscious decision, it's a passion, and it comes from the heart. Designers do
not choose that line of work to become rich and make tons of money. Mostly, like
other artists they crave for recognition. Driven by an Inner passion to create
and become famous as result of their own creation</p>
<p>Once graduating, a fashion
designer has two options. </p>
<p>Do it on his own or work
for someone else. </p>
<p>Working for someone else as
employees too turns them into small screws in a big machine. Something that
kills the spirit of an artist and a designer. Instead of Creating and designing,
the work turns into preforming and producing, following briefs and rules.
Usually it comes along with minimum wage and the death of the dream as it fades
away.</p>
<p>The second option is to
become independent, only independency in the fashion industry is almost missioning
impossible. Any independent business is hard. However, in a business such as Fashion
designing were the owner is actually the business itself doing all by himself,
it is twice as difficult</p>
<p>Being independent in the
fashion design business Is a one man show requiring a fashion designer to do
all on their own , weather they have the knowledge or not :  </p>

Have you ever thought how your designed suite dress or pants was
born and made, or who created it and how? Maybe you did, more likely you did
not. Like everything else, there is a story behind it. And it is not a pretty
one,
For a few years, I was the
CEO of a fashion & retail company. I was surprised to see that the people
in charge for fashion designing are far away from the glamour of the fashion world,
as I would expect. They were more like the back stage workers rather than the
actors on the stage. For me it came as a surprise. Fashion designers do the
hard work behind the curtain but on numerous occasions receive no credit.  
It turns out that being a
fashion designer is much more than difficult than you might imagine. Young designers
spend most of their time fighting for their professional and business survival.
Not glamorous at all.
Over time, I met many designers,
all young, talented and very passionate about their work struggling to survive
with limited chances if any. At some point, it hit me - there is a market
failure in the fashion market, one that no one cares about.
Like climbing the
Everest 
Being a designer is not a
conscious decision, it's a passion, and it comes from the heart. Designers do
not choose that line of work to become rich and make tons of money. Mostly, like
other artists they crave for recognition. Driven by an Inner passion to create
and become famous as result of their own creation
Once graduating, a fashion
designer has two options. 
Do it on his own or work
for someone else. 
Working for someone else as
employees too turns them into small screws in a big machine. Something that
kills the spirit of an artist and a designer. Instead of Creating and designing,
the work turns into preforming and producing, following briefs and rules.
Usually it comes along with minimum wage and the death of the dream as it fades
away.
The second option is to
become independent, only independency in the fashion industry is almost missioning
impossible. Any independent business is hard. However, in a business such as Fashion
designing were the owner is actually the business itself doing all by himself,
it is twice as difficult
Being independent in the
fashion design business Is a one man show requiring a fashion designer to do
all on their own , weather they have the knowledge or not :  
· 
Plan · 
Invent
the collection · 
Design · 
Produce · 
ship · 
Sell · 
Build
Price · 
Market
· 
Advertise · 
Build
a brand......

It is too much for most
people even if they own all of the knowhow, which most people do not.  Especially when they are young, only just
graduated. No wonder it's hard to succeed as an independent fashion
designer.  One can be a great fashion designer but still struggle when it
comes to inventory, cash flow, pricing and other aspects of the business and
thus, fail.  
So young people, creative,
passionate and filled with dreams find out real fast that there options in life
are… a bit gloomy
They suffer, but we suffer
too
This situation makes all of
us lose. There are more global leading strong brands than local unique ones. We
all pay more for expensive brands, getting more or less the same outfits as
thousands of others around the globe. We get less creativity, hardy no
innovation, smaller variety and, we pay more. Not to mention the fact that we
kill the spirits of those young creative passionate people that have less freedom,
if any at all, to create.
Freshionup.com started as a

It is understandable as it is really personal. for some people it involves vegan materials and no animal testing, for other it's organic fabrics and recycled materials and for others it comes down to fair practices or reduced environmental impact.<br/><br/>For me ethical fashion is fashion done the right way, with maximum benefit for the people making them and the ones wearing them, as well as minimum impact to the environment.<br/><br/>It is actually a simple idea and yes, it might get difficult in practice but some bands like Toms, Monkee Genes,  Bottletop and many more manage to make it a reality. I believe that their amazing products deserve to be seen and that the big industry players can learn a lot from them. I want to give them exposure and by buying ethical fashion products, you are using your voice in one of the smartest way when it comes down to fashion choices.

Being a small startup, I don't often have the opportunity to advertise my website and get exposure. With this event, thousands of people will get to discover the Selectablestyle Experience in just one weekend and I want to make this experience the best it can be. If it all goes well this could be a fantastic chance to make months of work finally pay off by having my work and the brands I support seen in the best light possible.At Makegood, Selectablestyle will have a large booth, which I need to fill up with ethical fashion brands' products, posters, cards, devices and goodies.The walls will have popping elements and visitors will be invited to go through a journey of what Selectablestyle offers and why ethical fashion brands need to be chosen over less ethical brands.








Why Indiegogo
I need to raise £654.00 to cover the cost of printing (posters, vinyls, experience cards and business cards, press leaflets), insurances, other materials (such as paint, MDF, DIY material), furnitures (shelves, see-through boxes, decorative objects), and the campaign fees for indiegogo and the payments provider.The Indiegogo Campaign will release enough funding to make Selectablestyle Makegood showcase the best it can be, and if successful, it may help me develop future avenues for the website.Understanding CostsIn case it goes really wellIf we exceed the initial funding target, I will set stretch goals that will allow me to improve the ethical fashion guide and continue developing it. I will be able to purchase an amazing template for the blog to turn it into a community and I will be able to fund specific website new features such as an ethical fashion map.In case it does not go so wellIf I don't reach my goal I will be really, really sad, and so will be my display at Makegood Festival. I will have to downgrade my display and use what I have raised for a flat poster. I wont be able to display the products in the best light but will do my best to do them justice and I will be really thankful to those who helped make it happen.Why is ethical fashion important?
The definition of ethical fashion might seem a little bit vague for many people. It is understandable as it is really personal. for some people it involves vegan materials and no animal testing, for other it's organic fabrics and recycled materials and for others it comes down to fair practices or reduced environmental impact.For me ethical fashion is fashion done the right way, with maximum benefit for the people making them and the ones wearing them, as well as minimum impact to the environment.It is actually a simple idea and yes, it might get difficult in practice but some bands like Toms, Monkee Genes,  Bottletop and many more manage to make it a reality. I believe that their amazing products deserve to be seen and that the big industry players can learn a lot from them. I want to give them exposure and by buying ethical fashion products, you are using your voice in one of the smartest way when it comes down to fashion choices. Be bold, embark on the Selectablestyle train and let's fill this world with better products, better jobs and better lives.Other ways you can help

<p><b><i></i></b></p>
<p>We decided it was time
to add pizazz to the functionality of today’s iPhone cases! Inspired by
the modern watch craze, we created the InDent Watchcase by working closely with
designers to integrate a self-contained watch into the back cover of an iPhone
case. This beautifully designed watch piece makes it easier to check the time
without having to turn on your phone, which just wastes valuable phone battery
and interrupts your social or business meetings. Now you can check the time
whenever you want because the InDent Watchcase is not only beautiful and
stylish, it also expands the functionality of your phone case!</p>
<p>The InDent Watchcase
comes with many distinctive and beautiful design options within 5 different
collections: Nature, Spiritual, Classic Clocks and the Designer Collections .
You may contribute to our campaign and receive one or more of these designs in the Perks section of our campaign. We will be expanding on these as we grow! </p>
<p>Once you receive your
InDent Watchcase, please let us know what you think. We also welcome any design
and functionality ideas that you may have. Thanks for your time and interest in
the InDent Watchcase!</p>

Why the InDent Watchcase?  

We decided it was time
to add pizazz to the functionality of today’s iPhone cases! Inspired by
the modern watch craze, we created the InDent Watchcase by working closely with
designers to integrate a self-contained watch into the back cover of an iPhone
case. This beautifully designed watch piece makes it easier to check the time
without having to turn on your phone, which just wastes valuable phone battery
and interrupts your social or business meetings. Now you can check the time
whenever you want because the InDent Watchcase is not only beautiful and
stylish, it also expands the functionality of your phone case!
The InDent Watchcase
comes with many distinctive and beautiful design options within 5 different
collections: Nature, Spiritual, Classic Clocks and the Designer Collections .
You may contribute to our campaign and receive one or more of these designs in the Perks section of our campaign. We will be expanding on these as we grow! 
Once you receive your
InDent Watchcase, please let us know what you think. We also welcome any design
and functionality ideas that you may have. Thanks for your time and interest in
the InDent Watchcase!

Let’s talk about how Sykla brings a fresh perspective to making smart watches.</span></p><p></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello! My name is Reza, and
I am the founder of Sykla. I have always loved technology and new innovations.
I have been involved with a few different tech start-ups throughout my career,
so I am no stranger to the manufacturing and development process. That’s why I
was so excited last year when we started to see smart watch technology evolve
and begin to gain mass adoption. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1082501/files/20141208220435-image1.jpg?1418105075"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><p>However I looked at the
smart watches available and honestly could <b>never</b>
see myself wearing any of those oversized computers in public. They were
hideous! As the year went on I was tired of seeing release after release of the
same old smart watches that didn't inspire or look beautiful like the beloved classic
timepieces from Tag Heuer, Hamilton or Nomos. The art of watch making was never
about packing as many FEATURES into your watch that you can fit, so why do
smart watch manufacturers feel the need to compete on features – camera, wifi,
3G, memory cards, video playback, etc, etc, etc.</p>
<p>I loved the idea of a smart
watch where I can quickly and at a glance see who’s calling without having to
remove my huge and lovely Samsung Note from my pocket.  But the smart
watches on the market were… <b>ugly</b>.
 And usually you need to press a button or shake your arm furiously to see
the time which impedes the main purpose of wearing a watch.  Why can’t we have a beautiful and artistic
time piece that just happens to be SMART?</p>
<p><b>Enter the Sykla Model ONE.  </b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1082507/files/20141208220527-image2.jpg?1418105127"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Sykla Model ONE was thoughtfully
designed by our experienced manufacturing partner from the ground up to be an elegant
time piece that you will LOVE to show off on your wrist. From the sharp and
bold lines reminiscent of a luxury sports car, to the soft and supple band that
whiffs of the familiar and pleasant scent of genuine leather – the Model ONE is
a fine time instrument that you will find yourself admiring throughout the day.
You will need to get used to receiving compliments and questions from all your
peers.  </p>
<p>The most unique thing about
our Sykla Model ONE is that it’s always ON. Just glance down at your watch and
you’ll see the time, no fussing about. We are confident that you will quickly
find the watch as a useful and dependable companion, and you’ll soon wonder how
you ever lived without it. </p>

Have you ever asked
yourself - Why are all the current smart

The past four years we have been everything from fiber nerds to computer geeks to our friends' personal seamstresses, and it is finally our time to show the world how we bring it all together in one fantastic fashion show and exhibition. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Our budget for the show is $15,000 which seems like a lot, but when you break it down it's really a bargain. This price tag includes the catwalk, runway set up and take down, lights, reception, exhibition displays, photography, hair and makeup, music, decorations, programs, tiny cookies for our models to eat backstage...and other supplies. We like to think of ourselves as crafty people, but even we can't build a stage and do electrical work... which is where you come in!</p>
<p>Based on the level of donation, we have perks from tickets to the show to screen printed canvas bags made by yours truly and even tours of the College of Textiles. From the hand looms older than our textile designers to the windowless dungeon studio that our fashion designers call home, you could see where all the magic happens! You can even support us by coming to our show on April 18th at 7 PM at the NC State College of Textiles and meet all of our parents. </p>

<p>Indian salt-farmers live in very poor conditions. Firstly, producing salt is a tough job. Farmers have to pump up seawater from the sea onto their fields. To do this, they mainly use hand pumps. Imagine using a hand pump for about eight hours...everyday!</p>
<p>Next to that, salt farmers receive extremely low prices for their salt. Since large-scale factories are rising, farmers are forced to sell their salt to exploiting salt traders. These traders offer a little as € 0.002 for one kilogram! The salt farmers have no opportunity to sell their salt to other outlets, because they have no clue how to do this. So, that’s why we’re gonna help them!</p>

<p>India’s middle and upper class is developing rapidly. These modern-minded consumers want to buy trendy products, but at the moment they can only get old-fashioned 1 kg salt bags. Which actually is a great opportunity for us! Our aim is to launch the first modern fair-trade salt brand in India: Chakardi. We will package our salt in trendy bags, sprinklers and grinders and sell it for a higher price. With the profit we generate, we can pay the farmers a fair price for their salt. Also, we will finance locally developed wind- and solar pumps, which will reduce the drudgery of the farmers.</p>

<p class=""Normaal1"">Our first 3,000 bags have already been produced and sold! Within 3 days, we sold all our salt at an Indian Food Fair. Now, we want to take this project to the next step.

<h3><b>Wer ich bin:</b></h3>
<p>Meine Name ist Volker Lux, ich bin 45 Jahre alt und Vater von 2 Kindern. <br/>Seit Weihnachten 1984 gehört meine Leidenschaft dem Skate-Sport. Auf <a href=""http://www.subvert.de/DIY-or-DIE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.subvert.de/DIY-or-DIE</a> erfahrt Ihr mehr, was ich seit 1986 ehrenamtlich auf die Beine gestellt habe. 2004 habe ich subVert gegründet, um zu dem Ehrenamt ein Gewerbe hinzuzufügen, um meine Tätigkeit finanzieren zu können. Meine Mission ist es, mindestens eine familienfreundliche Skatehalle für den Hamburger Raum zu schaffen. </p>
<p>Bis dahin versuche ich, Hallen temporär für den Rollsport verfügbar zu machen <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448905816/og77yqvqh6pdtxenxhpk.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">(</span><a href=""www.subvert.de/skareco-skatehall"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">2013-2015 im Oberhafen</a><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">, (</span><a href=""https://www.nordstarter.org/skatehalle"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">Anschubfinanzierung über mein erstes erfolgreiches Crowdfunding</a><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">projekt!) und ab sofort </span><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/skarecoskatehall/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></a><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/skarecoskatehall/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">Rindermarkthalle St. Pauli (Parkdeck)</a><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">)</span></p>
<h3>Worum es geht:</h3>
<p>Skateboard-Angebote an Schulen - davon träumen nicht nur die Kids von Hamburg und Umland, auch bei den Lehrern kommt das mobile Angebot super an, mit Anfragen aus allen drei Nachbarländern.<br/>Allein dafür lohnt sich das SkateSchoolMobil (ein Transporter voller Leih-Boards, Rampen und Schoner), aber wir haben weit mehr vor: Schon jetzt geben wir neben regelmäßigen Schulstunden auch einzeln buchbare Anfänger-Kurse und bieten Skate-Geburtstage an.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448906421/kerj1q172wnkjwruwurf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Das SkateSchool Mobil soll auch Skate-Vereinen und -Gruppen eine starke Stütze für die Durchführung von Contests oder anderen Skate-Events sein. Nicht nur durch Stellen von Infrastruktur (Soundanlage, Generator, Tische, Zelte, Pavillons etc.) sondern auch mit mobilen Rampen.
<p></p>
<h3>Was wir schon geschafft haben:</h3>Vor 2 Jahren starteten wir ein <a href=""https://vimeo.com/102290427"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">erstes Crowdfundingprojekt</a> für das Mobil, bei dem am Ende knapp 4.000 Euro fehlten. Wir konnten durch die erfolgsunabhängige <a href=""https://vimeo.com/107239739"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spende von Abasto</a> die Arbeit aufnehmen mit einem alten Transporter. <br/>Wir geben in Schulen regelmäßige Skateboard-Ateliers und einmalige bzw. sich jährlich wiederholende Workshops bei Jugendzentren oder Kunsthallen mit einem Aktionsradius von über 400 Kilometern - denn so ein Angebot gibt es bundesweit viel zu selten!</div><div>

Kids beim allerersten Workshop gleich den Drop-In beizubringen, macht mir größte Freude - und erfüllt die Kids mit Stolz. Das funktioniert mit ihren Eltern übrigens genau so gut ;-) (Foto: Bina Engel, sichtweise)


Wer ich bin:
Meine Name ist Volker Lux, ich bin 45 Jahre alt und Vater von 2 Kindern. Seit Weihnachten 1984 gehört meine Leidenschaft dem Skate-Sport. Auf http://www.subvert.de/DIY-or-DIE erfahrt Ihr mehr, was ich seit 1986 ehrenamtlich auf die Beine gestellt habe. 2004 habe ich subVert gegründet, um zu dem Ehrenamt ein Gewerbe hinzuzufügen, um meine Tätigkeit finanzieren zu können. Meine Mission ist es, mindestens eine familienfreundliche Skatehalle für den Hamburger Raum zu schaffen. 
Bis dahin versuche ich, Hallen temporär für den Rollsport verfügbar zu machen (2013-2015 im Oberhafen, (Anschubfinanzierung über mein erstes erfolgreiches Crowdfundingprojekt!) und ab sofort Rindermarkthalle St. Pauli (Parkdeck))
Worum es geht:
Skateboard-Angebote an Schulen - davon träumen nicht nur die Kids von Hamburg und Umland, auch bei den Lehrern kommt das mobile Angebot super an, mit Anfragen aus allen drei Nachbarländern.Allein dafür lohnt sich das SkateSchoolMobil (ein Transporter voller Leih-Boards, Rampen und Schoner), aber wir haben weit mehr vor: Schon jetzt geben wir neben regelmäßigen Schulstunden auch einzeln buchbare Anfänger-Kurse und bieten Skate-Geburtstage an.

Das SkateSchool Mobil soll auch Skate-Vereinen und -Gruppen eine starke Stütze für die Durchführung von Contests oder anderen Skate-Events sein. Nicht nur durch Stellen von Infrastruktur (Soundanlage, Generator, Tische, Zelte, Pavillons etc.) sondern auch mit mobilen Rampen.

Was wir schon geschafft haben:Vor 2 Jahren starteten wir ein erstes Crowdfundingprojekt für das Mobil, bei dem am Ende knapp 4.000 Euro fehlten. Wir konnten durch die erfolgsunabhängige Spende von Abasto die Arbeit aufnehmen mit einem alten Transporter. Wir geben in Schulen regelmäßige Skateboard-Ateliers und einmalige bzw. sich jährlich wiederholende Workshops bei Jugendzentren oder Kunsthallen mit einem Aktionsradius von über 400 Kilometern - denn so ein Angebot gibt es bundesweit viel zu selten!
Bei unseren Workshops spielen auch Balanceboards eine immer größere Rolle, erst recht in Schulen, in denen uns die Sporthalle nicht zur Verfügung steht und wir uns bei Regen auf ein Klassenzimmer beschränken müssen. Balanceboarding ist der perfekte Indoor-Sport für jedermann, fördert die Konzentration und verbessert Schulleistungen. Ihr könnt die subVert-B-Boards, custom-made in Hamburg, als Perk kaufen.
Wir konnten ""Mok"", den 11-fachen Freestyle-Weltmeister für unsere Arbeit gewinnen, der bei unseren Workshops und Mitmach-Aktionen, wie hier beim Kinderfest in Pinneberg ab und zu Shows fährt, um die Kids zu Höchstleistungen zu motivieren. Er bleibt in unseren Reihen und ist für Shows + Workshops buchbar, deren Erlös dem SkateSchoolMobil zu gute kommt. Danke, Mok!




Der alte Ducato wird im Januar nicht mehr über den TÜV kommen. Zudem brauchen wir ein Gefährt, welches weiteren Anforderungen gerecht werden muss:
Es braucht eine stärkere Anhängerkupplung, denn es wurde uns eine mobile Halfpipe angeboten, die man noch so gerade mit einem 3,5-Tonner ziehen kann (und in nur 2 Stunden komplett aufbauen kann). Wir brauchen mehr Sitzplätze für ein stärkeres Team. Bei Tageseinsätzen soll das (Wohn-)Mobil Rückzugsort für's Team sein. Und bei abseits liegenden Skateparks, die wir mit unseren Workshops beleben, werden wir auch oft nach einer Toilette gefragt, die wir dann dabei hätten.

Aber es wäre schade um die mobile Halfpipe, auf die wir dann ganz verzichten müssten, und regelmässige Kurse in Schulen wären nur noch möglich, wenn sich die Schulen Boards anschaffen.
Die Folgen
 Das SkateSchool-Mobil ist deshalb bei Sportlehrern und Pädagogen so beliebt, weil es die Kids motiviert, sich zu bewegen. Bewegung und Balance kommen in Zeiten von Playstation, Tablets und Smartphone zu kurz.

us and our sunglasses
Sirius
Attire is an eco-conscious brand born in Vancouver, British Columbia.
We have created the first bamboo sunglasses fused with genuine
semi-precious stones to enhance the stylish and earthy nature of our
product. We equally care about quality and comfort as well, which
is why our lenses are 400 UVA/UVB protected, have a polarization class of 3,
and the temples are equipped with flex hinges to fit any head size! They are also super lightweight so you'll forget that you're even wearing them. Follow us on: Instagram   Facebook  Twitter  YouTube

Our Sunglasses


















Instant
& free international shipping*
We
went through multiple stages of design and quality testing to
ensure we were satisfied with the end result. We are ecstatic with what we have which is why we have nearly 300 pairs
available to ship starting August 22! We
have allocated up to $25 of free shipping per package but in some rare
circumstances this
amount may go over – if so we will let you know in order to add on
to your reward.
Each
country, state, and province may or may not have it's own taxes or
duties associated with importing sunglasses. We can't keep track of
it all but usually small & light shipment should be nil or nominal or so we
hope! =)

Every
pair is one of a kind
Due
to the fact that both the frames and stones are natural, each pair will slightly differ from the pictures. We take this in as a positive as each stone
has it's own unique design!

Lenses
Our 400 UVA/UVB protected & polarized lenses (class 3) have been tested by a third party locally and certified in all tests under the USA (FDA), Australian/NZ, and European standards.
Unique
Lifetime Warranty
If
there are any manufacturer defects which cause it to break within the first year we will
accept a return on the product and refund the full value. After the
one year warranty, if you decide you don't want the sunglasses anymore we will credit 20% of your purchase price against a new pair if they
are in good condition. If they break in any way after 1 year we will
credit it at 15% value towards a new pair. The warranties are subject to returning the product back to us so we can do something cool with them.
Non-profit support
$1 from every pair sold, or shout-out reward purchased, will go towards one or more of the Plan Canada matched gifts seen below:
http://plancanada.ca/GiftsofHope/products/33-Matched-gifts/
We support the matched gifts program because donations are matched by various government, corporate and foundation organizations. Every dollar that we give can be leveraged 2x - 15x depending on what cause we support.

Packaging
In order to be a little more environmentally friendly we are sending the sunglasses contained in 100% recycled cardboard case which you may recycle instantly. Our pouches are made from a jute and cotton blend and the internal lining is 100% satin silk.

 


Design

During the design process we went thru several prototypes and experimented with different stones to achieve our desired look. Quite a few designs didn't make the cut while some are on the back burner for future models!

<h2>What makes CROSSKIX different from the competition?</h2>
<p>Below is a chart showing the advantages of CROSSKIX as compared to the one brand that dominates this category. We wanted to fill the void in this category for a more Sportier shoe that can be used in so many more ways than just a slip-on. Please review below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/435/025/bfe6c31c3f2ab0ff006722348559053c_large.jpg?1362903963"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>CROSSKIX are made with separate Upper and Outsole components which allow for greater flexibility and a ""real"" shoe feel.</strong></p>

<h1>Our Story.</h1>
<p>Let's face it....there is really ONLY one brand out there that dominates the EVA (soft foam composite) footwear category (as you have seen in the video). We all know who that is. But if you're like MANY other folks, you've probably have said to yourself...""they're comfortable, but I wouldn't be caught with them on!""</p>
<p><img alt=""shoe in mulch"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/425/537/24a095d6d39dcac2c41e3ca4ae76734d_large.jpg?1362533523"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>So, our goal was to design a shoe that EVERYONE can PROUDLY wear for multiple uses and of course...look GOOD while doing it. We believe there's definitely a void in this category for a more sportier, stylish, and functional shoe. So, we've spent over 4 years designing, redesigning, testing, retesting, producing sample after sample and have finally come up with a shoe that all men, women, and kids just can't wait to get their feet into. Our focus groups have unanimously voted on what you see.</p>
<p>We're committed to producing top quality footwear for the demanding consumer that cares about price, style, and functionality. We let YOU decide what you want in a multi-purpose athletic shoe. </p>
<h1>About the shoe.</h1>
<p>Crosskix are made with the highest grade of EVA (ethylyn vinyl acetate) material. It is basically a soft foam composite that is commonly used as midsoles in running and basketball shoes. Most people can identify the material simply by the brand c***s (we prefer not to be mentioned in the same breath simply because our shoe is much more superior in the way it is constructed, function and quality).</p>
<p><img alt=""shoe in grass"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/410/754/104bb9bcce4c76edd2eaf6e3fc14fadd_large.jpg?1361953655"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>They are VERY lightweight (only 7.5oz for size 11). The outsole and uppers are SEPARATE molds (not like the competition that is made with just ONE mold). This allows the shoe greater flexibility and to wear like a fabric made shoe. </p>
<p>The shoe also has stylish air vents that allow your feet to stay dry and cool. These same vents also act as drain holes for water to exit the shoe. This means that you can wear your Crosskix while washing your car, walking on the beach, or at the swimming pool. There are specially placed drain holes located in the heel of the footbed that allows water to flow outside of the shoe quickly and easily.</p>
<h2>Experience</h2>
<p><span>We have been in the athletic apparel industry over 10 years and in footwear for over 4. Collectively, our team has over 30 years in footwear design and manufacturing.

What is CROSSKIX?
A SUPERIOR alternative in soft foam composite (EVA) footwear and a Hybrid footwear for multiple uses. It is by far the most technical shoe in the EVA footwear category.
""CROSS"" is the short term for ""crossover"" and ""KIX"" is for ""kicks"" which is slang for shoes (a term typically used by young adults).
 
             CHOOSE from 8 STOCK COLORWAYS

What makes CROSSKIX different from the competition?
Below is a chart showing the advantages of CROSSKIX as compared to the one brand that dominates this category. We wanted to fill the void in this category for a more Sportier shoe that can be used in so many more ways than just a slip-on. Please review below.
 


Why CROSSKIX?

multiple uses - leisure, recreation, casual, and work
stylish AIR VENTS throughout to keep your feet cool & dry
soft and contour footbed for a comfortable fit
strategically located water vents for use IN and OUT of the water
PRE and POST foot recovery features (after playing sports)
EASY cleaning
100% RECYCLABLE - for playgrounds, track & field, basketball courts, etc.
fashion forward styling
 

 
CROSSKIX are made with separate Upper and Outsole components which allow for greater flexibility and a ""real"" shoe feel.

Our Story.
Let's face it....there is really ONLY one brand out there that dominates the EVA (soft foam composite) footwear category (as you have seen in the video). We all know who that is. But if you're like MANY other folks, you've probably have said to yourself...""they're comfortable, but I wouldn't be caught with them on!""

So, our goal was to design a shoe that EVERYONE can PROUDLY wear for multiple uses and of course...look GOOD while doing it. We believe there's definitely a void in this category for a more sportier, stylish, and functional shoe. So, we've spent over 4 years designing, redesigning, testing, retesting, producing sample after sample and have finally come up with a shoe that all men, women, and kids just can't wait to get their feet into. Our focus groups have unanimously voted on what you see.
We're committed to producing top quality footwear for the demanding consumer that cares about price, style, and functionality. We let YOU decide what you want in a multi-purpose athletic shoe. 
About the shoe.
Crosskix are made with the highest grade of EVA (ethylyn vinyl acetate) material. It is basically a soft foam composite that is commonly used as midsoles in running and basketball shoes. Most people can identify the material simply by the brand c***s (we prefer not to be mentioned in the same breath simply because our shoe is much more superior in the way it is constructed, function and quality).

They are VERY lightweight (only 7.5oz for size 11). The outsole and uppers are SEPARATE molds (not like the competition that is made with just ONE mold). This allows the shoe greater flexibility and to wear like a fabric made shoe. 
The shoe also has stylish air vents that allow your feet to stay dry and cool. These same vents also act as drain holes for water to exit the shoe. This means that you can wear your Crosskix while washing your car, walking on the beach, or at the swimming pool. There are specially placed drain holes located in the heel of the footbed that allows water to flow outside of the shoe quickly and easily.
Experience
We have been in the athletic apparel industry over 10 years and in footwear for over 4. Collectively, our team has over 30 years in footwear design and manufacturing. During the 4 years, we've actually developed 3 other designs and samples. All of which did not make the cut for design but more importantly - functionality. 
What is the money being used for?
All of the funds raised will be used to produce the MOLDS for sizes 3-13 and of course, our opening order. We also will use part of the funds to finalize packaging options.
Our 5 YEAR GUARANTEE!
We are very confident about our quality that if any part of your CROSSKIX becomes defective under normal use, we will gladly replace it with a NEW pair! Simply follow our return policy procedure by sending us a clear image of the defective area and we will send you an authorization code. Normal wear and tear does not qualify.
Because we are proud supporters of STAND UP 2 CANCER!
For all Pleasure Pink colorways selected, 10% of all proceeds will be donated to a Cancer Research Agency (yet to be determined IF we get funded). Most of us know someone that has been or is affected by this awful disease. Lets all support this cause and STAND UP TO CANCER

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Short Summary</span>
</h3>
<h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span>
</h3>
<p>We, Tune
and Ulla Johansen, have invented a fire shelter that you can survive in during
a bush fire. The fire shelter is tested above and beyond the Australian
standards. Other shelters already on the market have either not been tested, or
only tested to the Australian standard.</p>
<p>It is
hard to believe that in 2016 we can send people to the moon but still have
not protected ourselves against the very real and increasing threat of bush
fires, even though more and more people live in rural areas. When you live in a rural area it is important to ensure that you and your family will be safe in the event of a bush fire. </p>
<p>People loose their lives when caught in bush fires that are out of control, it just happened recently.This is avoidable through the use of non-toxic materials that has been used and tested over
many years. Pumice is a natural insulator and we know it works, we are
basically using nature’s own product to fight nature.<br/></p>

</div> <p>
</p>
<p>Our hope
is that through this Indiegogo campaign, we will raise sufficient funds to obtain the Australian Standard Approval, technical drawings for the assembly of the fire shelter
and further research. We aim for a simple and easy structure
that is easy to build.</p>

<em><em><em><em><i>

<p>
</p>
<p>This fire shelter has the potential to save lives in the bush fire zones, therefore it
is important for us to get our product to the market as soon as possible.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>
<p>
</p>
<p>Every
dollar raised through this campaign is valued and all funds will go to Safety
of the World, helping us to get this life saving fire shelter to the market. In
return we will reward you with interesting photos and video footage from the test
burn, as well as a sizable discount if you wish to place an order for our fire
shelter. If we do not reach the full funding, we will start with obtaining the Australian
Standard Approval. It is expensive but we are confident that our fire shelters can easily pass the test as it has already proven that our fire shelter works.</p>

<p></p>
<p><u></u></p>
<p><u>What we
have done</u></p>
<p>Build the fire shelter in full (we do not believe you can say people can survive simply by
testing a wall which is all the Australian Standards test require).</p>
<p>Tested to
above 1000°C with steady internal temperatures (refer to the test results in the graphs
below).</p>
<p>Invented
a heat and fire proof door for the shelter.</p>
<p>Installed
a small window (3 cm) to be used to check if the fire has passed and avoid the spread of panic in the room.</p>
<p>Tested
the fire shelter in real life with a simulated bush fire around the shelter
conducted by the Samsonvale Rural Fire Brigade, and measurements were recorded by a independent third party, Queensland University of Technology (QUT).</p>
<p><u>What we
know</u></p>
<p>We know a
bush fire on average runs for approximately 15 minutes and reach temperatures
between 250°C and 450°C.</p>
<p>Firestorms
reach above 1000°C for approximately 5 minutes and often travel at speeds between 120km/h and 140km/h.</p>
<p><u>Australian
Standards require</u></p>
<p>The Australian Standards require: </p>
<p>The testing of only one wall 3X3m with one fire door and one window</p>
<p>A fire proof door, with no requirement for it to be heat proof ( Our door is not only fire proof but also heat proof)</p>
<p>Reach
1000°C for 3 minutes only</p>
<p>As you
can see we have tested our fire shelter above and beyond the Australian
standards. We completed the test with exceptional results (see graphs
below). It was a combined effort from the Samsonvale Rural Fire Brigade, Queensland
University of Technology (QUT) and Safety of the World to ensure both accurate
and independent data collection.</p>

We, Tune
and Ulla Johansen, have invented a fire shelter that you can survive in during
a bush fire. The fire shelter is tested above and beyond the Australian
standards. Other shelters already on the market have either not been tested, or
only tested to the Australian standard.
It is
hard to believe that in 2016 we can send people to the moon but still have
not protected ourselves against the very real and increasing threat of bush
fires, even though more and more people live in rural areas. When you live in a rural area it is important to ensure that you and your family will be safe in the event of a bush fire. 
People loose their lives when caught in bush fires that are out of control, it just happened recently.This is avoidable through the use of non-toxic materials that has been used and tested over
many years. Pumice is a natural insulator and we know it works, we are
basically using nature’s own product to fight nature.


 

Our hope
is that through this Indiegogo campaign, we will raise sufficient funds to obtain the Australian Standard Approval, technical drawings for the assembly of the fire shelter
and further research. We aim for a simple and easy structure
that is easy to build.

This fire shelter has the potential to save lives in the bush fire zones, therefore it
is important for us to get our product to the market as soon as possible.

What We Need & What You Get



Every
dollar raised through this campaign is valued and all funds will go to Safety
of the World, helping us to get this life saving fire shelter to the market. In
return we will reward you with interesting photos and video footage from the test
burn, as well as a sizable discount if you wish to place an order for our fire
shelter. If we do not reach the full funding, we will start with obtaining the Australian
Standard Approval. It is expensive but we are confident that our fire shelters can easily pass the test as it has already proven that our fire shelter works.





What we
have done
Build the fire shelter in full (we do not believe you can say people can survive simply by
testing a wall which is all the Australian Standards test require).
Tested to
above 1000°C with steady internal temperatures (refer to the test results in the graphs
below).
Invented
a heat and fire proof door for the shelter.
Installed
a small window (3 cm) to be used to check if the fire has passed and avoid the spread of panic in the room.
Tested
the fire shelter in real life with a simulated bush fire around the shelter
conducted by the Samsonvale Rural Fire Brigade, and measurements were recorded by a independent third party, Queensland University of Technology (QUT).
What we
know
We know a
bush fire on average runs for approximately 15 minutes and reach temperatures
between 250°C and 450°C.
Firestorms
reach above 1000°C for approximately 5 minutes and often travel at speeds between 120km/h and 140km/h.
Australian
Standards require
The Australian Standards require: 
The testing of only one wall 3X3m with one fire door and one window
A fire proof door, with no requirement for it to be heat proof ( Our door is not only fire proof but also heat proof)
Reach
1000°C for 3 minutes only
As you
can see we have tested our fire shelter above and beyond the Australian
standards. We completed the test with exceptional results (see graphs
below). It was a combined effort from the Samsonvale Rural Fire Brigade, Queensland
University of Technology (QUT) and Safety of the World to ensure both accurate
and independent data collection.

Three graphs of our test results.

External
Temperatures



On the External
Temperature graph you can see we reach above 1000°C and the test ran
for 135 minutes. 

Internal
Wall



On the graph for the internal walls you can see the
temperature is stable at 20°C for approximately 20 minutes, there after the
temperature increases with 5°C in the next 20 minutes (bush fires run for
approximately 15 minutes, and a fire storm approximately for 5 minutes). The temperature

the 18 minutes, this only happened because the door was closed from the outside
and thereby allowed a leak as it was not under pressure from the inside. This
will not happen if the door is closed from inside which is how the shelter is the desinged to be used. 
Internal vs ExternalThis graph shows the huge difference on the
internal and external temperatures over the whole test period.Interview with first officer in front of fire shelter, just after test burning.Even
though we have exceptional results in our test burn, we would like to conduct further research into how to make a home fire proof, using our fire and heat

it more accessible to everyone living in a bush fire zone. It has been a long process (we have been working full time on this product for more than 2 years) and we are now at the point where we need funding to bring it further.

is that everyone living in a bush fire zone in Australia as well as the USA can
get a fire shelter and not have to fear for their or their families’ life if
they get caught in a bush fire.

Building the shelter


The
Fire Shelter has a few extra features worthwhile mentioning: 
- Double
roof layer structure to withstand falling debris
 -
Custom designed steel door that is the first on the market to be both heat AND
fireproof
 - Window designed with glass utilised in atomic reactors to withstand
temperatures of over 1600°C
 -

The fire shelter kit includes:


- The
steel for the frame
- The
building blocks
- 1 small window (additional available for purchase)
- The
breathable air tanks and masks (supplied for 6 people, with additional available for purchase) 
-
Materials for the door 
- Roof

 Risks & Challenges



Even the
most perfect projects face risk and challenges.
- The
biggest challenge and risk for us is that we do not obtain adequate funding to
keep our project going.  
- The next
challenge will be the Australian Standard, and regulations. 
- Convince
the media, politicians and the Australian Standard Board that the standards for building fire shelters should be raised as our shelter exceed the current standards. In our fire shelter people trapped in a bush fire can survive if they follow the directions provided with the shelter. 
- A user-friendly
manual must also be made to avoid incorrect construction and allow shelters to
perform as well as tested.
These are
some of the risks and challenges we can overcome with your support.

Works on a one motion lock and unlock function and protects against scratches while giving full access to the tracker display.Made with the highest quality Nickel Free, Hypoallergenic Brass and coated in 14K Gold and Palladium, Bellafit is a stunning piece of jewelry of the highest quality, pushing the boundaries of style and fitness wearables. In the ideation phase of our project, we considered designing something that concealed the tracker. Ultimately however, we realized that owning a fitness tracker gives the wearer a sense of pride. It's a statement about health and fitness goals, and we didn't want to compromise that. We wanted our design to complement the fitness tracker, not conceal it.

 
Art for your wrist
We have designed Bellafit to be a gorgeous piece of sleek yet structural jewelry. It can even be worn without your fitness tracker. The spacious dimensions of the Bellafit ensure it feels light and comfortable for the wearer, with or without the fitness tracker.

 Easy to wearBellafit can be put on and taken off with just a flick of one hand so you don't have to fuss when you're heading back to the office after your lunchtime workout. Accessible displayView your display and check your steps at any time while wearing your Bellafit.  3 ColorsBellafit is available in three timeless metallic hues, giving the wearer a multitude of style and color combinations to choose from.   3 ModelsIn order to make sure Bellafit suits the widest range of fitness trackers possible we have developed 3 different models:Choose Your ModelThe three Bellafit models, work with 23 trackers on the market as of the start of this campaign. Follow our guide below and match your fitness tracker to the Bellafit for you. Choose Your SizeWe offer Bellafit in two sizes, Small and Large. To know which size is right for you, download and print our size band below. Make sure to adjust the size band based on how you like to wear your tracker.  If the arrow lands on the S bar, then the small will best suit you. If it lands on the L bar, then the large size will best suit.KEY: Make sure to print the size band at 100%, otherwise you will not get an accurate result for your Bellafit size.  Choose the reward for you from the list below. Once the campaign is over, you will select details such as size, color, model etc and you will be given an additional chance to add rewards or extras via a very easy to use survey.The BELLAFIT If you've read this far you know what this reward is. Back this on InDemand and get the best discounts on our Retail Price. No need to worry about color, model or size now. You will be able to select all that on our survey after the campaign ends. We will make this process really simple.The Gift PackageWe haven't forgotten the boys. For all you adoring husbands, fathers, sons, boyfriends, brothers etc, this reward is for you.

This reward comes with special packaging and a greeting card that reads ""I thought about you, I hope you love this"".The BundlesYou can't get enough of Bellafit and you want one in every color, or 3 in every color. Most likely though, you have a bunch of friends who also want a Bellafit. Or you have a Retail Store and you have very savvy customers who would adore a Bellafit. Our Bundle rewards are for you guys.We hope you love Bellafit as much as we're enjoying this journey. Just in case you can't get enough, check out some color combinations we had fun with over the last few months.We started thinking about Bellafit in February 2015, but it wasn't until last year when we met the supremely talented Angie Kim, that we really started to zone in on the design. Bellafit today complements the wearable device, fits a large variety of fitness trackers, is easy to put on and take off and still, remains a truly iconic design.One year of design exploration, engineering, prototyping, refining later and the result is the structural, artistic, sleek and polished design you see today.Karen Whelan: CEO. 5 years’ experience in online marketing, international shipping and product development, Karen is currently working at a leading technology company based in Luxembourg.“My favourite part about working on the Bellafit project has been working with this team. They’re totally nuts. One day, I’ll share the outtakes from our videoshoot with Angie, or the screenshots I’ve taken of Carlos' attempts at ""bluesteel"" on one of our million video calls, or a list of the “that’s what she said” jokes that Julien manages to insert into every single business call. But until that time comes, just see them as superstars in their fields of expertise! They work so hard, they are warm, kind people.”  Carlos Martin: Advisor. Carlos worked in Shenzhen for almost 10 years as a product engineer, and is currently working at PCH Lime Lab in San Francisco. He has almost 20 years of experience of bringing products from design to manufacturing.  ¨When my friend Karen told me about her idea I didn´t hesitate to help her bringing her dream product to market.

<h3>The Problems</h3>
<p>The founder of K.O.M. Apparel looked at the current cycling apparel market and saw three problems; </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Design</strong><ul><li>Current cycling apparel brands are out of touch when it comes to designing product for riders. Design are repetitive and unoriginal, and where is the riders input? Custom designs are possible, but when custom orders are created, quality is often sacrificed to balance design costs, and customers must often meet unreasonable and unrealistic minimum order quantity rules. </li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Cost</strong><ul><li>Cycling apparel in general is expensive, especially as the quality of the product increases. Top and bottom pairs (kits) can reach $500+ dollars when reaching the long lasting and comfort level of professional apparel. Part of this cost is due to companies forecasting and carrying stock of their items, needing to then sell certain quantities at certain prices in order to maintain profit. Forecasting is difficult, and incurs costs then passed onto the customer.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Purpose</strong><ul><li>Not only is cycling apparel expensive, but for what purpose? To pay company salaries and go back into the company to sponsor professional teams with new toys? Customers should know their purchase is going towards more than that, and corporate entities should be held to higher socially conscious standards than profit in their sales.</li></ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Our Solutions</h3>
<p>Problems are opportunities for innovation, and that's exactly how K.O.M. Apparel approached improving the cycling apparel market for the consumer. The relationship we will hold with the customer is unlike any other cycling apparel brand, and we kept that ideal close to heart when developing our company's solutions;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Design</strong><ul><li>Get users in on the design process! With our model, apparel designs are provided by the users in a crowdsourcing platform. Customers submit designs, and their vote will also determine which kit is put into production. No longer will the opinions of corporate heads and acclaimed designers solely speak for the people.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Cost</strong><ul><li>One of our largest advantages is never carrying regular stock of our custom apparel. Everything is pre sold, meaning we will never forecast and order a quantity of product ahead of time, that we then need to sell in order to assure profit. As a result, no costs are incurred by storing and stocking custom apparel.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Purpose</strong><ul><li>Not only is our apparel high quality and less expensive because of our business model, but our apparel can be purchased for a reason beyond consumerism. K.O.M. Apparel prides itself in maintaining numerous partnerships with nonprofit organizations, allowing users to donate a dedicated portion of proceeds from their purchase to a partner of their choice. Beyond revenue and profitability, our brand offers a social aspect as well.</li></ul>
</li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We have secured a manufacturer, tested our supply chain, and brought real product to real people. Up until this point, financing efforts have been through the bootstrapping efforts of our founder, and now we're asking for your help. This campaign holds the goal of $10,000, and we have some very specific places your contribution will go. Our last barriers to full scale market entry are all about improving user experience. Final packaging and labeling goods, a space to safely hold our product before final shipment to customers, and our e-commerce costs are all specifically budgeted items your contribution makes possible.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Packaging &amp; labeling, printed goods</strong><ul><li>As our company's full launch approaches, our absolute goal is to provide the best user experience possible. Beyond our standards of customer service and revolutionary customer relationship formation, we believe in providing for you down to the finest details. These details include the last touches of handwritten letters, beautiful tags, and other printed goods to be included in users shipments.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Workspace</strong><ul><li>As highlighted in our problem solutions, K.O.M. Apparel has eliminated the need for true product warehouses and storage facilities. We are proud of the savings this allows us to provide riders. We do, however, still need one small facility to assure product quality and allow the hand packaging of purchases by our staff.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>E-commerce</strong> <ul><li>K.O.M. Apparel is an entirely e-commerce based brand, meaning we maintain no physical storefront for our business. As a result, we are able to provide for a significantly larger population of riders, and implement our process of crowdsourcing and user voting. The funds of our founders have allowed the development of our e-commerce platform, and it is your final contribution that will allow our full scale, public launch.</li></ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Those are the specific places your backing will go, all in our mission to provide high quality cycling apparel with a personally designed touch and give users a reason for their purchase other than corporate profit. Crowdsourcing designs, user voting, and partnerships with nonprofit organizations to donate a percentage of proceeds - that's what we're about, and that's what you make possible.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>As campaign backers, you have a variety of rewards and perks to select, ranging from ""immortality"" to full apparel packages, and even the opportunity to collaborate and design the first public kit of K.O.M. Apparel.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">1. <strong>Immortality (of sorts)</strong></p>
<ul><li>Immortality?! A public page of our website will forever be dedicated to the backers of this campaign, filled with their names, eternalizing them for all of time. Backers of this reward will also receive a handwritten letter from the Founder of K.O.M. Apparel.</li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">2. <strong>Nonprofit Donation &amp; Cap</strong></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>So, why back us? We give our users a voice in the product and design they receive, and not only do we give our users a voice, but users can feel incredibly positive in the voice they have with K.O.M. Apparel. More than with any other company, the opinion of our customers is heard, and due to the contributions their purchase makes to our nonprofit partners, is an opinion worth voicing. Help us become a reality, and know you helped a University of Wisconsin - Whitewater student realize his dream of providing riders with high quality, crowdsource designed cycling apparel while donating to meaningful nonprofit causes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any startup, there are associated risks and challenges with our progress. Our goal from the beginning has be to eliminate and minimize the risks and challenges our team will face, and we have with great success. Manufacturing logistics, gender differences in our apparel lines, ease of website use, and nonprofit partnerships all came with associated hurdles (or barricades, you cyclocross junkies) our founder overcame.  At K.O.M. Apparel, we believe one of our biggest challenges to be brand outreach and user engagement. Putting our name onto the radar of riders is of the utmost importance, and it is what will allow our entire crowdsourcing and donation platform to thrive. Luckily, in talking with incredible mentors available at the University of Wisconsin - Whitewater, and such successful crowdsourcing business founders as Henry Schwartz at <a href=""https://www.mobcraftbeer.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MobCraft Beer</a>, our team is confident in our ability to meet these challenges. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We mentioned a potential challenge of user engagement, and that's where you come in. Whether you can or are willing to donate, sharing our campaign and brand is something everyone can take part in. If you believe in our movement, take a moment to share, tweet, forward, link... anything our campaign. At the top of this campaign page, Indiegogo features simple to use sharing tools.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you, and we at K.O.M. Apparel are eager to begin our progress together.</strong></p>

WorkspaceAs highlighted in our problem solutions, K.O.M. Apparel has eliminated the need for true product warehouses and storage facilities. We are proud of the savings this allows us to provide riders. We do, however, still need one small facility to assure product quality and allow the hand packaging of purchases by our staff.


E-commerce K.O.M. Apparel is an entirely e-commerce based brand, meaning we maintain no physical storefront for our business. As a result, we are able to provide for a significantly larger population of riders, and implement our process of crowdsourcing and user voting. The funds of our founders have allowed the development of our e-commerce platform, and it is your final contribution that will allow our full scale, public launch.


Those are the specific places your backing will go, all in our mission to provide high quality cycling apparel with a personally designed touch and give users a reason for their purchase other than corporate profit. Crowdsourcing designs, user voting, and partnerships with nonprofit organizations to donate a percentage of proceeds - that's what we're about, and that's what you make possible.
What You Get
As campaign backers, you have a variety of rewards and perks to select, ranging from ""immortality"" to full apparel packages, and even the opportunity to collaborate and design the first public kit of K.O.M. Apparel.
1. Immortality (of sorts)
Immortality?! A public page of our website will forever be dedicated to the backers of this campaign, filled with their names, eternalizing them for all of time. Backers of this reward will also receive a handwritten letter from the Founder of K.O.M. Apparel.
2. Nonprofit Donation & Cap
Aligning with our nonprofit partnerships, select this reward and donate to Back on My Feet. This organization provides employment and stable housing opportunities to the homeless through running. Also, you will receive a limited edition K.O.M. Apparel cycling cap.
​
3. Patch, Drink, Snack and Strava
Make us work for it! Receive an iron-on patch, a snack from Barnana, and 1lb of coffee provided by Stone Creek Coffee. Also, for every backer of this level, our founder will ride 2 miles, and prove it to you through Strava. Yes, we know it's about to be winter in Wisconsin... Ride on!Noah Stamsta's Strava

Also, we'll make a donation to the nonprofit organization Back on My Feet, helping it's members move their lives towards stable housing and employment ($25).
11. Collaborator's Package
This is the big one. You will work directly with K.O.M. Apparel to create one of the designs for the Public Launch of our brand. Collaboration, plus everything listed in the ""One of Everything, Please"" package. Also, we'll get you a pair of custom, handpainted Fizik R1B's, handpainted by Simon Fellows of Artful Kicks.

The Impact
So, why back us? We give our users a voice in the product and design they receive, and not only do we give our users a voice, but users can feel incredibly positive in the voice they have with K.O.M. Apparel. More than with any other company, the opinion of our customers is heard, and due to the contributions their purchase makes to our nonprofit partners, is an opinion worth voicing. Help us become a reality, and know you helped a University of Wisconsin - Whitewater student realize his dream of providing riders with high quality, crowdsource designed cycling apparel while donating to meaningful nonprofit causes.

Risks & Challenges
As with any startup, there are associated risks and challenges with our progress. Our goal from the beginning has be to eliminate and minimize the risks and challenges our team will face, and we have with great success. Manufacturing logistics, gender differences in our apparel lines, ease of website use, and nonprofit partnerships all came with associated hurdles (or barricades, you cyclocross junkies) our founder overcame.  At K.O.M. Apparel, we believe one of our biggest challenges to be brand outreach and user engagement. Putting our name onto the radar of riders is of the utmost importance, and it is what will allow our entire crowdsourcing and donation platform to thrive. Luckily, in talking with incredible mentors available at the University of Wisconsin - Whitewater, and such successful crowdsourcing business founders as Henry Schwartz at MobCraft Beer, our team is confident in our ability to meet these challenges. 

Other Ways You Can Help
We mentioned a potential challenge of user engagement, and that's where you come in. Whether you can or are willing to donate, sharing our campaign and brand is something everyone can take part in. If you believe in our movement, take a moment to share, tweet, forward, link... anything our campaign. At the top of this campaign page, Indiegogo features simple to use sharing tools.
Thank you, and we at K.O.M. Apparel are eager to begin our progress together.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> <b>- BAMBOO and EBONY WOOD: </b>Each watch features an all natural bamboo or ebony wood case that is rich in texture. No watch is exactly the same.</p>
<p><b>- </b><b>GENUINE LEATHER: </b>Each watch features a high quality, genuine leather band.</p>
<p><b>- STYLISH yet UNIQUE: </b>Our watches were designed to fit right in with the latest fashion trends and styles, while at the same time, stand out from all the other watches out there. It's a beautiful paradox.</p>
<p><b>- COMFORTABLE:</b> Wood and leather are extremely light weight. Each watch weighs less than one ounce and the leather band form fits to your wrist for a customized fit. </p>
<p><b>- DURABLE: </b>Neither wood nor leather wears the other down. They work together in perfect harmony to create a lightweight, yet durable time piece. </p>
<p><b>- ON TIME: </b>With the help of an experienced watchmaker, we selected a high quality and accurate Japanese quartz movement to ensure that you and your watch are always on time. </p>
<p>-<b>WE NEED YOUR HELP: </b>We've lined up a manufacture and have had samples made. In order to enter production we need to order the watches in huge quantities. This means we need lots of money to make the first order... which two full time students don't have. By pre-ordering a watch today, you can help us raise the money we need to purchase the raw materials and enter into production.</p>
<p><b>-ELITE LUNOWEAR MEMBER: </b>Anyone who backs us by pledging $45 or more will receive this Elite Status. With this status you will receive 20% off lunowear products for life (any product purchased from our website).</p>

<p>Nearly a century ago, my great-grandfather lost his leg in a saw mill accident. Devastated by the loss of his leg and terrified about how he would provide for his family, he thought all was lost. At the time, watchmaking was a rare, but highly needed skill. With the need for local watchmakers, the state of Utah paid to have my great-grandfather trained and certified to work on a variety of time pieces. With his newly acquired skill his family not only got by, they thrived. He became a very successful and well known watchmaker. His son (my grandfather) took over the family business when his father retired. That experience with my great grandfather instilled in my family an undying passion and gratitude for the trade of watchmaking. </p>

<p>(My grandfather, Calvin)                                            (My great-grandfather, Wilfred)</p>
<p>Growing up I spent hours in awe watching my grandfather work on watches in his shop. Every year for my birthday, I would flip through my grandfathers catalogs and pick out a watch, which my grandparents would then get me as a gift. I've acquired quite the collection over the years. Before this project began, I was looking at my watch collection and thought ""whats next?"" I wanted something different than anything I had. After some time searching, I decided I needed to add a wooden watch to the collection. After months of looking, I couldn't find the wood watch I had in mind, so I approached my grandfather with my situation and we decided to create it with some help from a good friend of mine. </p>
<p>Watches were something I had developed a passion for, but I knew very little about watch design. I had a good idea as to what I wanted the outcome to be like (look, price etc) but that was strictly cosmetic. I knew very little about watch movements, crystals, bands, cases etc. Calvin (my grandfather) was instrumental in the design process. He helped us design an incredibly reliable and affordable time piece. Without Calvin, there would only be an idea and sketches of what could be.

<p>The idea started not as a business venture, but as a result of looking for a wooden watch for personal use. We found several options, but none that met our high expectations. A year and a half ago we noticed the need for a better looking and more affordable wood watch. We hit the drawing board.</p>
<p>-The Paper-</p>
<p>After doing a lot of research with current products, we had a pretty good idea of what we wanted the watch to have. We put together a rough sketch of the idea and labeled the main parts. We knew we wanted the finished product to have a wood case and leather band. We came up with a checklist of things we wanted the finished watch to accomplish. We wanted to make sure the watch was affordable yet maintain a high standard of quality. The design had to be aesthetically pleasing. Of course, the watch had to keep accurate time. We wanted the watch to be slim and simplistic. We had a pretty good idea as to what we wanted the
final product to look like, but that was strictly cosmetic. We knew very little
about what went into making a quality watch. We knew we would need a
professionals help so I immediately went to my grandfather to seek his advice. Once we had a few rough sketches and the main details on paper and the processional help we needed, it was time to find a manufacturer who could turn this idea and sketch into a reality.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">-The Manufacturer-</span></p>
<p>We spent weeks researching different manufacturers. We came up with a list of manufacturers that would be able to create what we had in mind. After an extensive process of sifting though manufacturers, we finally selected one. We then sought out companies who had experience working with them and found nothing but positive feedback. We are proud to say that all the research paid off and we have found a very reliable manufacturer that produces high quality products. With a manufacturer lined up, the detailed design was next. <br/></p>
<p>-The Design-</p>
<p>Our manufacturer presented their capabilities to us. They showed us the extensive options they had to offer for the customization of the watches. We literally had hundreds of options at our fingertips. We were very excited to get going on our designs, to say the least! For each watch we selected the case, case-back, case size, wood type, band material and band size, buckle type, movement, glass type, bezel, stitching and stitching color, crown, etc. No detail was left untouched. Throughout the whole process we worked hand in hand with Calvin, my grandfather. This was a thrill for us all. For us, we were designing or first watches. For Calvin, he was designing most likely his last watch ever. Our manufacturer had several different
movement, crystal, and watch dimension options to choose from. I had no idea
what the differences were between them. We all agreed that the goal was to create a
reliable and durable, yet affordable time piece. My grandfather was the brain behind making
that happen. He helped us select the Miyota 2035 Japanese Quartz Movement to use for each of our watches. With our manufacturer, we started with a conceptual graphic design for each watch. We spent weeks changing and fine tuning the graphics until we were satisfied. We then gave our manufacture the ""thumbs-up"" to create the first round of samples. Once the first samples were done we fine tuned them some more, making some minor changes. After months in the design process, we took a step back and couldn't help but smile. They looked GREAT!</p>
<p>-The Test-</p>
<p>Once we got our samples Calvin was the best partner you could ever have. He took the watches apart to verify the quality of each component. After 50+ years as a watchmaker, he has incredibly high expectations for a timepiece. They got his approval on every level. Once they passed the integrity check, it was time to really put them to the test. We spent a year testing our watches to ensure they could keep up with our active lifestyle. It has been over a year now and each of our watches have met our every expectation. When we got our watches, we were excited to make them available to the world but we didn't feel right selling them until we gave them a thorough test. We can say with complete confidence, we are offering a quality product. We stand by our watches 100%.</p>
<p>-Why Our Watches-</p>
<p>With the wide variety of watches available in the world (both wood and steel) the question arises, ""why should I buy this one when there are similar looking watches out there"". Our answer is simple, Ours are different. As mentioned above, we spent months focusing on the small and seemingly insignificant details. It is the small things that all come together to create a masterpiece. We feel that is the case with our watch designs, we hope you agree! With the help from a reputable life-long watchmaker, we used affordable and high quality components for our watches. They are built to last without breaking the bank. We have throughly tested and inspected our watches. We stand by them 100%. We hope people are just as thrilled with our customer service as they are with our watches. We are offering a 1 year warranty for any manufacturer defects. We will work with you on a case by case basis to repair or replace your watches, should any issue arise. We also have big plans for the future of our brand. We are looking forward to a bright future of innovative and quality products. We know we couldn't make this happen without our backers.

<p>We've created a time piece that fits right in with minimalist type fashion accessories, while still being <b>unique</b> and <b>different</b>. Our watches feature a sleek and simple all natural <b>bamboo</b> or <b>ebony</b> wood case with a genuine <b>leather</b> band. This construction accomplished several things:</p>
<p><b>-Fashionable-</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1430559/files/20150430160440-6638a8811b4e1985f8be19b83c0b2cf9_original.jpg?1430435080"" src=""""/></p>

<p>With the combination of wood and leather, each watch weighs less than one ounce. The genuine leather band forms to your wrist for a customized fit. </p>
<p><b>-Durable-</b></p>

<p>Leather wears well over time. Ebony wood is extremely dense and bamboo is incredibly flexible which creates a durable case that will be long lasting. Wood and leather complement each other nicely and neither one wears the other down.</p>
<p>*Each wood case has a water resistant/protective finish so moisture from splashing during hand washing or rain isn't an issue, but they are not submersible.  We strongly recommend avoiding any contact with water.</p>
<p>-<b>Unique</b>-</p>

</div>
<div><b>Update and info on our switch from Kickstarter to Indiegogo:</b></div>
<div>
<p>As the days have passed we have gathered more information.</p>
<p>Some background info:<br/>How watch manufacturing works, and now it has worked for the last 30+ years, is when one wants to design a watch, they reach out to a watch manufacture. From there, they design a watch with readily available components (e.g. movement, case, case dimensions, case material, crystal type, band material, band dimensions, hands, face, numbers, dial, bezel etc) and finish it off with their brand logo. This is how the vast majority of watch companies manufacture watches, with the exception of brands like Rolex. They manufacture their own watches, which is in part why they are so expensive. Keep in mind, we are selling ours for $45.</p>
<p>Anyways, this is what we did with my grandfather on board helping us pick quality and reliable components. Unfortunately, when designing a watch with readily available components, anyone (including your manufacturer) can design the same or similar watch. Unfortunately many people, including Kickstarter, didn't take the time to do their homework and claimed we were ""scamming"" people by buying wholesale watches and reselling them for a profit. NOT THE CASE! We have all the files and information we need to prove otherwise. You'll also notice that you can't find anything similar to many of our other watches.</p>
<p>Case in point:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/High-Quality-stainless-steel-watch-Japan_1752889935.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.alibaba.com/…/High-Quality-stainless-steel-watch…</a></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.nixon.com/us/en/product/48-20-chrono-A486.html?sku=A4862052-00"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nixon.com/us/en/product/48-20-chrono-A486.html…</a></p>
<p>It is the ""same watch"" with minor differences. Does this mean Nixon didn't design their watches? No, it means they used readily available components that anyone has access to which inevitably leads to being able to find similar looking watches on the internet.</p>
<p>You can do this same process with ANY watch on kickstarter. If you take a few minutes to look for their watch on the internet, especially Alibaba, you will find their watch. The wood and leather watch industry is much smaller so you will find similar watches easier, but if you look closely for similar steel watches, you'll find them no problem.</p>
<p>This is what the critics of our campaign and Kickstarter failed to understand. All Kickstarter would have had to do is ask and we could have sent them over all our design files and conversations with our manufacture that took place well over a year ago. This is what Indiegogo did and we resolved the issue.</p>
<p>I hope this can clear up some of the misconceptions going around.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for all of the support!</p>

 - BAMBOO and EBONY WOOD: Each watch features an all natural bamboo or ebony wood case that is rich in texture. No watch is exactly the same.
- GENUINE LEATHER: Each watch features a high quality, genuine leather band.
- STYLISH yet UNIQUE: Our watches were designed to fit right in with the latest fashion trends and styles, while at the same time, stand out from all the other watches out there. It's a beautiful paradox.
- COMFORTABLE: Wood and leather are extremely light weight. Each watch weighs less than one ounce and the leather band form fits to your wrist for a customized fit. 
- DURABLE: Neither wood nor leather wears the other down. They work together in perfect harmony to create a lightweight, yet durable time piece. 
- ON TIME: With the help of an experienced watchmaker, we selected a high quality and accurate Japanese quartz movement to ensure that you and your watch are always on time. 
-WE NEED YOUR HELP: We've lined up a manufacture and have had samples made. In order to enter production we need to order the watches in huge quantities. This means we need lots of money to make the first order... which two full time students don't have. By pre-ordering a watch today, you can help us raise the money we need to purchase the raw materials and enter into production.
-ELITE LUNOWEAR MEMBER: Anyone who backs us by pledging $45 or more will receive this Elite Status. With this status you will receive 20% off lunowear products for life (any product purchased from our website).






















Our men's watches are slightly bigger then our women's watches, which is really the only thing that makes them ""men's watches"" or ""women's watches"". Many women choose to wear a men's watch and visa versa. You do you!





Nearly a century ago, my great-grandfather lost his leg in a saw mill accident. Devastated by the loss of his leg and terrified about how he would provide for his family, he thought all was lost. At the time, watchmaking was a rare, but highly needed skill. With the need for local watchmakers, the state of Utah paid to have my great-grandfather trained and certified to work on a variety of time pieces. With his newly acquired skill his family not only got by, they thrived. He became a very successful and well known watchmaker. His son (my grandfather) took over the family business when his father retired. That experience with my great grandfather instilled in my family an undying passion and gratitude for the trade of watchmaking. 

(My grandfather, Calvin)                                            (My great-grandfather, Wilfred)
Growing up I spent hours in awe watching my grandfather work on watches in his shop. Every year for my birthday, I would flip through my grandfathers catalogs and pick out a watch, which my grandparents would then get me as a gift. I've acquired quite the collection over the years. Before this project began, I was looking at my watch collection and thought ""whats next?"" I wanted something different than anything I had. After some time searching, I decided I needed to add a wooden watch to the collection. After months of looking, I couldn't find the wood watch I had in mind, so I approached my grandfather with my situation and we decided to create it with some help from a good friend of mine. 
Watches were something I had developed a passion for, but I knew very little about watch design. I had a good idea as to what I wanted the outcome to be like (look, price etc) but that was strictly cosmetic. I knew very little about watch movements, crystals, bands, cases etc. Calvin (my grandfather) was instrumental in the design process. He helped us design an incredibly reliable and affordable time piece. Without Calvin, there would only be an idea and sketches of what could be. His true passion lies in old pocket watches with a jeweled mechanical movement, but he loves any unique time piece. He was thrilled to get involved with the project.

Any great product starts with an idea and slowly evolves into a finished product. LunoWear Watches were no different. -The Idea-
The idea started not as a business venture, but as a result of looking for a wooden watch for personal use. We found several options, but none that met our high expectations. A year and a half ago we noticed the need for a better looking and more affordable wood watch. We hit the drawing board.

-Unique-

A wooden watch isn't something you see every day. In and of itself it's unique but each wood case has a slightly different pattern, thus every watch is different from the next.
-Represent-

We chose to use bamboo and ebony wood for our watch cases. Ebony wood is very dense. In fact, it's so dense it sinks in water. With wood, dense = durable, so we knew we could count on it to last.


Bamboo is also very durable. It is extremely flexible which means the wood will ""micro-flex"" rather then crack or break if dropped or bumped.

Both woods offer a unique textured look that stands out. 

Once we got our first samples of watches, we couldn't wait to put them through the ringer to see if they would pass the lifestyle test. We threw everything we could think of at them... and they passed with flying colors.
We used the watches doing all the activities we do on regular basis to make sure they wouldn't hold us back. We used them biking (and crashing), rock climbing, fly fishing, hiking, golfing, playing tennis and of course, work and school.

NOT THE CASE! We have all the files and information we need to prove otherwise. You'll also notice that you can't find anything similar to many of our other watches.
Case in point:
http://www.alibaba.com/…/High-Quality-stainless-steel-watch…
http://www.nixon.com/us/en/product/48-20-chrono-A486.html…
It is the ""same watch"" with minor differences. Does this mean Nixon didn't design their watches? No, it means they used readily available components that anyone has access to which inevitably leads to being able to find similar looking watches on the internet.
You can do this same process with ANY watch on kickstarter. If you take a few minutes to look for their watch on the internet, especially Alibaba, you will find their watch. The wood and leather watch industry is much smaller so you will find similar watches easier, but if you look closely for similar steel watches, you'll find them no problem.
This is what the critics of our campaign and Kickstarter failed to understand. All Kickstarter would have had to do is ask and we could have sent them over all our design files and conversations with our manufacture that took place well over a year ago. This is what Indiegogo did and we resolved the issue.
I hope this can clear up some of the misconceptions going around.
Thank you so much for all of the support!

<p>The idea of KOURA started in April 2020 in the middle of Covid-19 pandemic. People were afraid of this new threat and did not want to move around or meet others. We wanted to help people feel safer and do our part to make the world a little bit better place for all of us. We worked days and nights besides our day jobs to make Koura happen. Two months later the product sample was ready. The journey has just began, please help us to continue it.</p>

<p>We are looking for backers to enable us to launch KOURA. Currently we are in prototype phase and the funding will help us buy production molds, set up production and launch Koura. We take all the support we can get, but ideally are looking for 50.000 euros to do this. In return we give our backers generous discounts for pre-ordering Koura.

<h3>Phil·o·me·la</h3>
<p>In Greek mythology, Philomela was a woman who was sexually assaulted by her sister’s husband, who then cut her tongue out to keep her from talking. So she wove a tapestry that depicted the story of what had happened to her, and presented it to the gods in a request for justice. The gods granted her request, and turned Philomela and her sister into a nightingale and a starling, so that they could fly away and be free. Philomela will be the name of our new line, because it embodies the story of our artisans, who had their voices taken away but now are given a chance to fly free.</p>
<p>You read that right—<strong>we're starting a new line! </strong>After looking closely at market trends and profit models, we realized that in order for Imagine Goods to thrive, we need to tap into the ethical goods market with more upscale goods. Don't worry—the items you know and love won't go anywhere. We're going to continue making the popular Imagine Goods items, and we're going to continue offering them to you at affordable prices. But in addition to those, our new line will be targeting a different demographic—one that brings a higher profit margin so that we can grow Imagine Goods and employ more survivors.</p>
<p>The Phil·o·me·la line will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple, classic, luxury dresses, blouses, and skirts</li>
<li>Fair-trade certified</li>
<li>B Corp certified</li>
<li>Fabrics that are hand-woven using all-natural dyes </li>
</ul>
<p>And, of course, all handmade by EMPOWERED SURVIVORS OF TRAFFICKING, like all Imagine Goods products!</p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>In order to get started, we need just $10,000 for:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pattern cutter to create unique, beautiful pieces </li>
<li>Excellent photography to showcase Phil·o·me·la to a luxury market</li>
<li>Website, promotional materials, &amp; branding</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we can raise just $10,000 to start Phil·o·me·la, we can provide, in the FIRST year, the following for 5 artisans!</p>
<ul>
<li>A thriving wage</li>
<li>On-site child care</li>
<li>Mental &amp; physical health care</li>
<li>Continuing education</li>
<li>Family-style lunch</li>

<h3>Why We Do What We Do</h3>
<p>We've been traveling to Cambodia for 11 years now, working with several organizations that provide services to survivors of trafficking. And we've heard one thing over and over again. In order for true, lasting societal change, SURVIVORS NEED JOBS. When an artisan receives empowering work in the employment center, whole extended families' lives are changed: now, instead of begging or living in a brothel with mom, a child can be in a safe, on-site child care, next to an empowered and employed mom. </p>

Social enterprises focus on a triple bottom line:  people, planet, and profit. Upon completion of the Crowdfunding phase of the competition, 5 ideas will be chosen to move on to the Live Pitch, during which the contestants will present their ideas to a panel of judges, with winners receiving a package of cash and pro-bono prizes.

Part of my the requirements to graduate from SCAD  is a completion of a senior project.  As a Fashion Design major our senior project is to design a collection of six outfits.  Not only are we to come up with a themed concept, but actually realize it.  This includes raising money for the raw materials to produce my six garments, raw materials for the person I am collaborating for the accessories, and buying shoes for the models to wear for the Senior Fashion Show that is held for the public.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Exposed is a collection that was initially inspired by shattered glass and the way it cracks. This past year during winter finals my car was broken into and they completely shattered the glass of my car. Not only did the glass break into several beautiful shapes, colors, and reflections; but also it gave me a life realization. As I worked on the collection and talked with others, the meaning developed into something more personal. This project was going to be a way to express my emotions about all the bad things and the people I have lost involving shattered glass.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before, I just found beauty in the shattered glass in the colors and shapes, but I found the beauty in the story that these cracks would tell. Ever since I was little everything bad that has happened in my life has involved shattered glass and the deaths of 20 of my closest friends in car accidents since my sophomore year of high school. Since I didn't expect any of these moments to happen, they did ... thus my inspiration found me. But the collection is not meant to be dark, it meant to take those lost moments and make them beautiful. It is meant to celebrate the life of the ones who I have lost and to possibly have emotional closure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While thinking about all of these factors, I finally realized I was trying to expose myself. Trying to expose my vulnerability; to shed the armor of emotions I have been hiding behind for years; to final reveal the emotional secrets that I have kept hidden for so long. Thus my journey for self-revelation and healing began.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My ideal goal is to raise $8000.00 to $10,000 to properly produce my vision.  Upon Completion of my senior requirements I would like to showcase my work to show others how art can be part of a healing process.  I have already starting reaching out to the public about this idea, I would also like to take my collection to high schools to encourage students to follow their dreams and how they can turn tragedy into a positive energy.  Let them know if they put their mind to it they can accomplish whatever they want.</p>
<p>Any contribution means a lot, but helping me spread the word about my collection would be greatly appreciated!</p>

The event is scheduled for June 2016 in Kansas City, Missouri.</p>
<p>The Paradiso staff was formed by members of the Kansas City, Columbia, and St. Louis communities in order to bring together the Japanese Fashion enthusiasts in the state of Missouri.

<p>We believe that the EGL community in the United States should be a safe place for all of its members, and that there should be more events by Lolitas, for Lolitas (and oujis and mori girls too, of course!) We aspire to be a catalyst in the movement to bring the communities of the Midwest closer together so that we may all share our love of Japanese Street Fashion with one another in a caring, supportive environment.</p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign, you'll help us lay the foundation for what is sure to be an enchanting event, with guest speakers, vendors, a fashion show and tea. Additionally, by banding together to crowd fund our campaign, you'll prove that EGL enthusiasts are passionate enough to host their own, independent events outside of the umbrella of anime and media conventions that have over shadowed our interests in the past.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Million Monkey Clothing has been operating since March of 2010.  We currently only sell our products via our website, Facebook, and at events that we set up at.  Our brand has gotten an incredible amount of positive feedback; however, we always have customers ask about our ""STORE"".  Since the economy has taken a dive it has been difficult for entrepeneurs to open brick and mortar stores.  Our plan is to renovate a Ford E-350 Step Van that we already own and transform it into a mobile store so we can take our products to our customers.  The marketing strategy with a brick and mortar store is to create a plan to drive traffic into your store, but with a mobile store we go to customers.  We not only want to take our products to our customer, we want to create an experience for them as well.  The money from the campaign will help us renovate the van with a vehicle wrap, new engine (so we can travel the nation without worries), new tires, store fixtures to display our products, sound system, generator, appropriate licensing, and the cost to modify the side of the truck so it opens up and doubles as a stage for performances!  Our goal is to be able to display and unveil the truck at an annual event we participate in called Sneaks Up.  The event is on April 29, 2012 in San Antonio, Texas.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Part of our vision is to help individuals chase their dreams and become one out of a million.  With the success that this truck will bring us, we will be fortunate enough to help our sponsored artist on a monetary level so they can reach their dreams.  Million Monkey also plans on being involved in our community and giving back.  With the truck we will be able to park it at events such as Habitat for Humanties and donate a portion of our procedes to that non profit.  Not only will it bring awareness to the non profit, but we can raise money for them as well. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our campaign goal is $30,000!!!  Here is where the money is going(remember this is going to be a mobile store with an experience of a lifetime):  Vehicle graphics wrap-5,000, new tires-1,000, side body modification-5,000, fixtures/shelving-3,000, appropriate licensing-500, music/lighting equipment-3,000, generator-1,500, engine-2,500, misc flooring and diamond plating and racks-6,000.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So here's what's in it for you:  Donation amounts followed by incentives</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Million Monkey Clothing has been operating since March of 2010.  We currently only sell our products via our website, Facebook, and at events that we set up at.  Our brand has gotten an incredible amount of positive feedback; however, we always have customers ask about our ""STORE"".  Since the economy has taken a dive it has been difficult for entrepeneurs to open brick and mortar stores.  Our plan is to renovate a Ford E-350 Step Van that we already own and transform it into a mobile store so we can take our products to our customers.  The marketing strategy with a brick and mortar store is to create a plan to drive traffic into your store, but with a mobile store we go to customers.  We not only want to take our products to our customer, we want to create an experience for them as well.  The money from the campaign will help us renovate the van with a vehicle wrap, new engine (so we can travel the nation without worries), new tires, store fixtures to display our products, sound system, generator, appropriate licensing, and the cost to modify the side of the truck so it opens up and doubles as a stage for performances!  Our goal is to be able to display and unveil the truck at an annual event we participate in called Sneaks Up.  The event is on April 29, 2012 in San Antonio, Texas.



The Impact
Part of our vision is to help individuals chase their dreams and become one out of a million.  With the success that this truck will bring us, we will be fortunate enough to help our sponsored artist on a monetary level so they can reach their dreams.  Million Monkey also plans on being involved in our community and giving back.  With the truck we will be able to park it at events such as Habitat for Humanties and donate a portion of our procedes to that non profit.  Not only will it bring awareness to the non profit, but we can raise money for them as well. 


What We Need & What You Get
Our campaign goal is $30,000!!!  Here is where the money is going(remember this is going to be a mobile store with an experience of a lifetime):  Vehicle graphics wrap-5,000, new tires-1,000, side body modification-5,000, fixtures/shelving-3,000, appropriate licensing-500, music/lighting equipment-3,000, generator-1,500, engine-2,500, misc flooring and diamond plating and racks-6,000.  

So here's what's in it for you:  Donation amounts followed by incentives

$10-Button/Sticker set
$25-Million Monkey logo tee* + Silicon bracelet + Button/Sticker set
$50-Two Million Monkey tees from our current series* + Silicon bracelet + Button/Sticker set

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<ul><li>My name is Dara Jendayi. I am a 21 year old senior at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Fl. I am a full-time student at FAU, a part-time student at the Art Institute of Ft. Lauderdale , and I work as a team member of the amazing tech designer and manufacturer, <a href=""http://www.theankit.com,"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.theankit.com,</a> I am a team member of Organo Gold, I give sewing lessons on school day evenings, and I work on my clothing line and brand, Jendayi, daily. I am an Artist. I write both spoken word poetry and ghost write music, so I am back and forth to the studio often as well. I perform at events where I can share my art of spoken word; it is a serious passion of mine. I am a busy individual, but I am extremely passionate and relentless with my work ethic. I do freelance gigs whenever I can fit them into my schedule because I can use every extra dollar and quality networking opportunity I can get. I am also very passionate about children, so I keep them in mind as I develop my brand. I run a charity through Jendayi for Shriner's Hospital for Children. I also make sure Jendayi is always something young people can look up to. I have done children's collections and having four- year-olds walking in my clothing always reminds me that they are always looking and absorbing what we put out. I make it mandatory, before anything else, that my models are role models, from how they project themselves on social media, to how they carry themselves in person, to the goals they set for themselves, because what is within, is seen without. I am on a mission to change the world through all my art--with my words, my actions, my wardrobe, and clothing line as I set new precedents and show young people that positivity can be  popular. I am passionate about leadership and ownership. We must protect the art we create, we must positively impact with our gifts, and we must have ownership of what we create and not let anyone take what we are passionate about and merely turn it into  dollars for themselves .</li></ul>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;"">My campaign's purpose is to gain the funds necessary to get crucial things completed for the brand to begin to run more efficiently. This includes the relaunch of my Web site and raising money for the Jendayi fashion event happening in January 2015 (dates subject to shift to February 2015) in Miami, Florida. This event will debut my first ever male collection, it will showcase other budding designers, and it will highlight many young hard working artists. This show will be a direct benefit to the designers and artists being recognized by allowing them to showcase their work to a large audience,  and will also benefit three charities: Haiti- Delivering protein packs to the citizens of Haiti promoting health and the elimination of malnutrition, The Entrepreneurial Academy- A new curriculum started by Gershom Faulkner of St. Petersburg, Fl. that teaches young individuals the ins and outs of entrepreneurship and gives them resources to start their own businesses and a third one TBD. This campaign is extremely important to me because I began Jendayi at age 16. I have been working on Jendayi throughout school, jobs, and throughout my teenage  years and it has grown tremendously from where it began. I am not only the designer (design &amp; construction) of Jendayi's clothing but I also do all my own photography, hair, makeup, styling, marketing, outreach, finances, charity, and all other business aspects of the brand. Due to my budget and resources, I had to learn how to do every aspect of the brand so I could achieve the quality and image I wanted and do it at a pace that I was satisfied with. After I launched my official site in 2012 I started a blog on the site where I did a weekly feature called #WorkingWednedays. This feature garnered over 1000 views a week. On Working Wednesdays I featured young, hard-working individuals, such as Jerome Fulton a college student who, in spite of both parents being deceased, has averaged a 3.9 GPA and is  working with a fortune  500 company. Working Wednesdays was extremely important because not only did it give these hard-working young people some well deserved recognition but young people from all over the country wanted to share their stories with me. I had college students come up to me and tell me they recently got another job so they could be featured. It was a beautiful movement and the relaunching of the site needs to happen so Working Wednesdays can continue! I just hired my first employee (Sept, 9, 2014), and I am taking full advantage of all her skills. She is a mother of a beautiful 7 year old girl. She is eager to chase her dreams of breaking into the fashion world, and she sees the vision and brand of Jendayi as her way in.   Although I am a broke college student, with the typical college student budget expenses of bills, books, fees, etc... I am willing to spend my very last penny to accomplish my dreams</span><ul>
<li>Jendayi is not a typical fashion brand. Jendayi was created as a tool to positively impact society with a specific focus on youth. Art, whether it be music, drawings, poetry, fashion, or photography, always has a huge audience, so imagine what would happen if we projected positivity and core values like self-love, faith in self, and work ethic through our art forms- we could change lives, thus changing the world! With your contributions, you are doing just that! When someone wears the Jendayi logo, it is not just a pretty word. Jendayi means faithful and the business message is Stay True to You, and this is what we need to do as individuals. I know a lot of young girls that personally tell me that they actually want to get into more artistic things instead of going to parties all the time, but they have no one to go to museums with and their friends do not support their desires to switch up their lifestyle, so these girls (and guys have expressed this to me as well) continue with their status quo ways due to lack of support. It is easy to say, drop all your friends and do it on your own and go to these places alone, but that is very hard. Jendayi promotes that strength required to branch out and be your true self. Jendayi shows how no desire, dream, or passion is easily achieved, but with faith, patience, and hard work it can be achieved. With every item purchased, every contribution, every ounce of support, Jendayi grows and we are able to spread these amazing, vivifying, world-changing values with more and more people!</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The first $1000 dollars of contributions will be dedicated to the technical side of Jendayi, this includes domain repurchasing, site relaunching (which will include the relaunch of the JendayiBLOG!!!). Any extra money from those designated funds will be for my charity, Shriner's Hospital for Children in Tampa, Fl.  The other sum of contributions goes 100% to the event that will be the debut of the new Jendayi collections as well as the charity benefit for the multiple fundraisers. This will be a huge event. I am in need of more funds than requested here, but I know this will be a good start to get the ball rolling and get the proper venue reserved for the event. More sponsors will be requested even after this campaign, as we want to be able to give a great amount to all the charities, and have the proper decor, hosts, etc. Another awesome aspect to this event will be the out of town guests coming in to enjoy the event. I am working to find a great hotel to sponsor a discounted rate so I will be able to offer the out of town guests a complimentary 2-night stay in Miami, Florida the weekend of the event. These guests will be responsible for their travel so I definitely want to provide a nice stay for them free of charge. Out of town guests will include some young people who will be a part of the entrepreneurial academy, young business owners who will be contributing their services to the event, and many others.</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Every single contributor will be put in a raffle, we will randomly select a lucky winner who will be able to bring a guest to stay in Miami, Fl. at the hotel (tbd) for the weekend of the event, as well as be VIP guests! </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Every $100 contributor will be shipped a Jendayi Signature Shirt as well as some great Jendayi extras like stickers and accessories! </span><br/>

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-weight: bold;"">This event will impact many young, hardworking, talented individuals working to get their name and talent exposed.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-weight: bold;"">Success Track</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Two years in a row I have been able to break the record for attendance at my fashion shows at Florida Atlantic University. I was able to change the annual talent show, Live at IVAN, into a fashion show my sophomore year. At that event I created the largest, most attended housing program ever. Last year I began a fashion group at FAU and to end the year I put on a huge fashion show. This event was the biggest fashion show ever at FAU, surpassing 300 guests. I assisted with every fashion event at FAU last school year, as my track record spoke, and all other organizations wanted that outcome at their event. </li>
<li>At age 16, I produced my first fashion show in St. Petersburg, Fl., titled STRUT. STRUT had over 30 young models from ages 3 to 26 traveling from as far as Orlando to participate in the show as models. This event was held at Nova 535, in downtown St. Pete. Aveda Hair School sponsored all the hair and make up, courtesy of school owner, Mr. Petrillo. Volunteer photographers came to take images for the event and my immediate family played a big role in providing time to complete this event. Designers from Tampa and St. Pete came to showcase their lines and with the successful completion of the event, I was able to form long-lasting relationships with very important people, such as the owner of Nova 535, Michael Novilla.</li>
<li> My event coordinating skills are solid and I have created a good network of individuals that can help with multiple aspects of the event. I have a huge vision for Jendayi, therefore I would never release something, be a part of something, or produce something that is not 100% representative of my brand and all it stands for! Following my last show at FAU, people look at me now as a respected designer and event coordinator. There are lots of people who attended the last show and are looking forward to this one, as well as people who were unable to attend and heard the reviews and are looking forward to this upcoming event! </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px;"">With Jendayi there is a risk of a lack of appeal to the targeted audience. There is always a risk that me as a young person, could get distracted or overwhelmed and have a breakdown preventing me from producing the event I explained. As any event, there is always a risk of a lack of attendance, </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px;"">I am qualified 100% to eliminate and/or minimize all these risks, and your contributions will help me do so. With proper funding I am able to bring in individuals to work in their respective fields of expertise so I can focus on the clothing and the event coordinating. I will be able to outsource help for certain aspects of the event as well, eliminating the risk of me getting overwhelmed and not producing the high quality event I envision. When it comes to the risk of Jendayi lacking appeal, I have become very big on research. Research partnered with my keen eye and ability to create new appealing trends, has helped eliminate about 90% of that risk. Unparalleled work ethic and excellence are a habit for me. I have overcome many hurdles, and I can't imagine any that could stop me at this point. </span></p>

I was volunteering at the Special Olympics when I saw a little girl and her dad walking side by side. The little girl was discouraged repeatedly telling her dad that she couldn’t do it. The father looks down and tells the little girl you’ve done this before, you can’t give up now. He continues to encourage her as they walk up the street to the next event she was competing in. No matter what the little girl would say, the father had something positive to say and eventually changed her mind. The little girl once discouraged, was now feeling optimistic. This was just one in many instances that I had the opportunity of experiencing. During my time helping at the Special Olympics, I learned the power of optimism. We ourselves go through ups and downs but those athletes taught me that despite adversity that everything will be okay. They didn’t have to say this but being around them it was understood they lived it. </p><p>This experienced happen at a strange part of my life. During this time I was going through some issues of my own. The summer of your freshman year you’re still unsure of many things and you’re just looking for an identity. Through the experiences that I’ve shared I really connected with those athletes of the Special Olympics. I wanted to give back but I just didn’t know how until a friend suggested spreading what I’d learned, which was the power of Optimism. The hardest part was finding a way to do so until that same friend suggested T-shirts. His reason being was that to spread Optimism you have to find a way to make it part of individuals daily lives. </p><p>In a world today where optimism is needed most we want to make a difference. We believe you represent yourself in someway by the brands you wear and represent. MoAp is believing in yourself, being you and achieving what you want to achieve through positivity and being optimistic.

<p></p></div>","As Featured In:Short Summary
 MoAp, is about telling a story and making a difference, as we support many charitable organizations through the sales of our products.Our StoryThis project started during the summer of 2012. I was volunteering at the Special Olympics when I saw a little girl and her dad walking side by side. The little girl was discouraged repeatedly telling her dad that she couldn’t do it. The father looks down and tells the little girl you’ve done this before, you can’t give up now. He continues to encourage her as they walk up the street to the next event she was competing in. No matter what the little girl would say, the father had something positive to say and eventually changed her mind. The little girl once discouraged, was now feeling optimistic. This was just one in many instances that I had the opportunity of experiencing. During my time helping at the Special Olympics, I learned the power of optimism. We ourselves go through ups and downs but those athletes taught me that despite adversity that everything will be okay. They didn’t have to say this but being around them it was understood they lived it. This experienced happen at a strange part of my life. During this time I was going through some issues of my own. The summer of your freshman year you’re still unsure of many things and you’re just looking for an identity. Through the experiences that I’ve shared I really connected with those athletes of the Special Olympics. I wanted to give back but I just didn’t know how until a friend suggested spreading what I’d learned, which was the power of Optimism. The hardest part was finding a way to do so until that same friend suggested T-shirts. His reason being was that to spread Optimism you have to find a way to make it part of individuals daily lives. In a world today where optimism is needed most we want to make a difference. We believe you represent yourself in someway by the brands you wear and represent. MoAp is believing in yourself, being you and achieving what you want to achieve through positivity and being optimistic. When you wear our products you know with the good conscience that a portion of sales will fund organizations that empower children.Since Then..Everyone has moments in their life that change them; that little girl changed my life. It set me on a path to try and give back. Now I have a wonderful team around me that all strive to change the world and create a high quality product that we can all be proud of. From our Creative Director and our first designer to our interns we have had great people working on making you look good while we all make a huge impact.We have worked long nights for the past 8 months and are so proud to have an excellent product, a great partnership, and we are ready to make a difference. All we need is YOU!Our Concern:MoAp came out of passion to encourage others by creating a brand that only focused on spreading positive energy or spreading the power of optimism while giving back. That passion allowed me to realize somethings: Things We Noticed:  1. When we looked at the retail market we seen a lot of negativity. Many of the shirts and other products in the market had phrases such as “SWAG”, “Dope”, or “Middle-fingers”.We wanted to change the negative market. We believe you represent yourself in someway by the brands you wear and represent. Product Demand:The demand for our products has risen greatly, but we're still small - too small in fact. Our demand has outstripped our ability to keep up, and our ability to keep our customers supplied with the great products in a timely fashion. After support from individuals such as John Legend, Gabrielle Giffords, Common, and Daymond John (from shark tank and founder of FUBU) our demand has increased significantly.Now, we need to grow, which is a great thing because that is what we set out to do and also to prove that manufacturing in America is still possible, and not only that, it can create jobs over and over again.What We Need & What You Get Why Indiegogo?Ultimately all of the money here is going to help build momentum for MoAp and will be helping us launch our first complete line of t-shirts! In order to do that we need our first production run and we need to start distributing so you can help spread the word about MoAp.First, we want to offer a wider variety of designs. We currently are limited to what we can afford to stock through our supplier -- and even though we're selling shirts, we have to immediately turn around and put that money into new inventory of our existing designs. We can't make minimum orders of new designs and still have stock of all men's and women's sizes. Second, we want to offer our shirts in a variety of fits. Our supplier only prints shirts on a Basic Short-Sleeve cut for Men, and a Basic Slim-fit cut for women. BORING! We want to offer our designs on Fashion Fit shirts and V-Necks, which is impossible through the existing supplier network out there. Finally, and most importantly, we want to support more organizations. When you wear our products you know with the good conscience that a portion of sales will fund organizations that empower children. Why Our Shirts Rock?What Our Shirts Fund? Through shirt sales, we fund non-profits providing opportunities to children worldwide. Having worked in business development, we know that each non-profit partner will have unique needs and goals; so we structure shirt sales around meeting those specific needs.Packaging Here's how this works: you contribute, and at the end of this campaign, we go into production and then ship you your awesome ""perk"" (in most cases, a shirt).

<p><b>THE STORY BEHIND THE STRAPS</b></p>
<p>My name is Jon Yeazel, and I wear a lot of suits. One day, almost a year and a half ago, I was looking for the perfect watch strap as a finishing touch for my outfit. It didn’t exist.</p>
<p>I wanted to keep the watch face, but replace the strap with something other than your standard black or brown leather. I tried NATO straps in different materials and colors, but they didn’t feel right. I tried fabric watchbands with lugs, but they were too hard to change on a regular basis because they require tools. I wanted a strap that would look, feel and impress as much as the suits I was wearing, but be just as durable as the more traditional leather options. After scouring the planet for just such a strap it became clear that if I wanted my version of a perfect watch strap I was going to have to make it myself.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>THE JOURNEY TO GET HERE</b></p>
<p>210 East Oak is the conclusion of over a year of research, development and iterative design into the creation of a luxury suiting watch strap that’s easy to change, gorgeous and guaranteed to impress. Designed in house in our Chicago studio, each 210 East Oak luxury suiting watch band is made with luxury suiting fabric and a patented quick-release mechanism that makes selecting the perfect strap a more difficult task than actually changing it. In order to make this a reality, we partnered with two of the most prestigious manufacturers on the planet, Holland &amp; Sherry and Hadley-Roma.</p>
<p><b>OUR PARTNERS AND MANUFACTURERS</b></p>
<p>For almost two centuries, Holland &amp; Sherry has been supplying some of the finest cloths in the world to prestigious tailors and luxury brands. The Savile Row staple is our exclusive partner for this release because of their exquisite collection of fabrics, the gorgeous patterns and their high-end construction. For the manufacturing itself, we turned to Florida based manufacturer Hadley-Roma, ""America's Watch Attachment Company."" Hadley-Roma has been making the parts that attach your watch face to your wrist for over a century. We're absolutely certain that, with over 300 years of experience between the two of them, our manufacturing partners are the perfect fit to make the perfect watch strap under the 210 East Oak label.</p>

My name is Jon Yeazel, and I wear a lot of suits. One day, almost a year and a half ago, I was looking for the perfect watch strap as a finishing touch for my outfit. It didn’t exist.
I wanted to keep the watch face, but replace the strap with something other than your standard black or brown leather. I tried NATO straps in different materials and colors, but they didn’t feel right. I tried fabric watchbands with lugs, but they were too hard to change on a regular basis because they require tools. I wanted a strap that would look, feel and impress as much as the suits I was wearing, but be just as durable as the more traditional leather options. After scouring the planet for just such a strap it became clear that if I wanted my version of a perfect watch strap I was going to have to make it myself.

THE JOURNEY TO GET HERE
210 East Oak is the conclusion of over a year of research, development and iterative design into the creation of a luxury suiting watch strap that’s easy to change, gorgeous and guaranteed to impress. Designed in house in our Chicago studio, each 210 East Oak luxury suiting watch band is made with luxury suiting fabric and a patented quick-release mechanism that makes selecting the perfect strap a more difficult task than actually changing it. In order to make this a reality, we partnered with two of the most prestigious manufacturers on the planet, Holland & Sherry and Hadley-Roma.
OUR PARTNERS AND MANUFACTURERS
For almost two centuries, Holland & Sherry has been supplying some of the finest cloths in the world to prestigious tailors and luxury brands. The Savile Row staple is our exclusive partner for this release because of their exquisite collection of fabrics, the gorgeous patterns and their high-end construction. For the manufacturing itself, we turned to Florida based manufacturer Hadley-Roma, ""America's Watch Attachment Company."" Hadley-Roma has been making the parts that attach your watch face to your wrist for over a century. We're absolutely certain that, with over 300 years of experience between the two of them, our manufacturing partners are the perfect fit to make the perfect watch strap under the 210 East Oak label.



ABOUT THE COLLECTIONThere are a lot of things that make the original, quick-release suiting fabric watch straps from 210 East Oak special. They're going to initially be available in sixteen different patterns, conveniently named for the cities that inspired them. 


You can change the straps multiple times a day if the mood suits because of the quick-release strap mechanism. They're made with high quality materials like wool suiting fabrics, genuine leather and stainless steel and constructed with a turned-edge stitching technique that's so labor intensive it's all but extinct.

<p>
</p>
<p><b>THE PRODUCT</b></p>
<p>The FlatTops™
camera system is a portable, autonomous, wireless IP security camera for
outdoor applications. It consists of a state of the art 2 megapixel, 360 degree
IP Camera housed in a uniquely designed environmentally protective enclosure
which provides a 360 degree unencumbered field of view. In addition, the
FlatTops™ system incorporates an integrated photovoltaic panel and lithium
polymer battery cartridge that can provide electrical supply to operate the
system in conditions of low light or even in total darkness.</p>
<p>The
FlatTops™ camera system supports encrypted WiFi network connections and can
stream real time video to any supported network, including IP based
infrastructure and AdHoc Peer to Peer network structures.</p>
<p>Additionally,
the system can be configured to record imagery directly onto internal SD card
and can store up to a 14 day loop of continuous video whilst simultaneously
streaming video to a remote network or operating entirely isolated from a
network connection.</p>
<p>Stored
video recordings can be accessed remotely at any time using an encrypted WiFi
network connection or in situations of totally isolated operation, these
recordings can be rapidly downloaded using a laptop computer, tablet or
smartphone. For example a security officer or park ranger could simply download
the data from a series of remotely situated FlatTops™ camera devices from their
car every couple of weeks even if there was no permanent WiFi network
established in the area.</p>

</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The
objective of the project was to design a versatile IP camera based security
product that was portable and fully autonomous.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The system
had to be very quick and easy to install without requiring any physical
connections for electrical supply or data communication.</p>
<p>Additionally,
the system needed to be able to be set up as a temporary or semi-permanent installation
yet at the same time be relatively tamper proof, and offer advanced features and
accessibility from mobile devices such as smart phones, tablets etc. as well as
conventional PCs.</p>
<p>Data
communication was a relatively easy problem to solve through the use of WiFi
which is a well-established and reliable technology. Solar power was the
obvious choice for provision of electrical supply. However, many significant
difficulties existed in realizing an effective system utilizing solar power.
Although IP security cameras have relatively low power consumption which is
well within the capabilities of a medium-size solar panel, it must be
remembered that full sunlight is only available for a relatively short time
each day. Even in good conditions, a solar panel will only average about four
hours of peak performance over a 24-hour period.</p>
<p>Obviously,
batteries can be used to store energy during times of low light or night.
However, when you factor in all of the inefficiencies and energy losses
resulting from transferring energy to and from a battery bank as well as
providing DC voltage conversion and stabilisation in addition to non-optimal
alignment of the photovoltaic array with respect to the sun then the minimum
requirements for the solar panel become significantly higher than that of the
camera system alone.</p>
<p>Recent
developments in high-efficiency solar cells in combination with low-power, low
voltage IP camera technology has made this project a feasible reality.</p>

<p><b>APPLICATIONS</b></p>
<p><strong></strong></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FtS3uyHD9Ne4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DtS3uyHD9Ne4&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FtS3uyHD9Ne4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>The
IP security camera represents a great step forward in the field of video-based
security. It offers significant advantages over its CCTV predecessor. In
particular its inherent ability to be monitored remotely via internet protocol
wired and wireless networks, utilising a diverse range of platform independent
software.<span>  Additionally, its ability to
stream real-time video imagery to mobile devices such as smart phones has
changed the paradigm of the security industry from one of service provider
based monitored security to one of user monitored security.</span></p>
<p>However
for all of its obvious advantages, outdoor IP security cameras are still in the
domain of government organisations and large scale commercial security
installations. </p>
<p>The
objectives of the FlatTops™ project is to deliver the performance of a hi-tech
permanent camera installation in a low cost, user installable package that is
both easy and quick to install and configure.</p>
<p>Because
of its inherent ease of setup, in addition to the security of the
semi-permanent mounting, the FlatTops™ camera system has a multitude of
immediate applications that many people would not have even considered.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><p><b>House</b></p></li></ul>
<p>Imagine
you are going on a trip and you want to make sure that the garden and swimming
pool are being taken care of while you're away.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul><li><p><b>Worksite</b></p></li></ul>
<p>Imagine
you have hired contractors for a renovation on your house. You come home from
work to find they have done the job totally incorrectly. Without any clear
evidence of what really happened in your absence, what started out as a simple
renovation could quickly turn into a legal and insurance nightmare.</p>
<p>Additionally,
theft of building materials is a major problem with small to medium size sites.
The FlatTops™ security system can provide a powerful theft deterrent for a
fraction of the cost of a full time security guard.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul><li><p><b>Events</b></p></li></ul>
<p>Imagine
that you are arranging an outdoor event with lots of people. An IP security
camera installation can complement ground staff and assist in providing both a
safe and lawful environment. Drugs, alcohol, violence all of these things are
much less likely to occur when somebody knows they are close to a camera.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul><li><p><b>Liability</b></p></li></ul>
<p>Liability
is a major concern for just about everybody nowadays. Having this type of
recording security system would be a great benefit to many organisations. For
example, in the case an accident, injury, damage or theft occurring in a
parking lot. Simply being able to show evidence of what really occurred could
solve many disputes and possibly also assist police in apprehending those responsible.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul><li><p><b>Schoolyard</b></p></li></ul>
<p>Imagine
you are operating a school or day care centre. There have been reports of
people loitering in the vicinity of the playground and the local park where the
children play. There are parents with obvious concerns about the situation, but
what can you do ? Setting up a temporary IP security camera goes a long way to
both alleviating the parent’s concerns and also in assisting local police in
identifying and apprehending any wrongdoer before something serious occurs.
With this system, all this can be achieved for a fraction of the cost of
appointing security personnel.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><p><b>Wilderness</b></p></li></ul>
<p>Park
Rangers or security guards could benefit from the placement of camera devices
in areas where problems such as illegal camping or damage to protected areas
and/ or trespassing is a frequent occurrence. FlatTops™ camera units could be
placed in hidden locations, even attached to trees. Recorded video files could
be periodically accessed and downloaded remotely by WiFi from the comfort of a
vehicle, without ever having to touch the camera device. Given that the
FlatTops™ camera system is solar powered and totally maintenance free it could
remain attached to a tree or other remote site indefinitely.</p>

<p>Various
colour schemes are available for the base, mast, and head sections of the FlatTops™
camera system. Some parts of the camera system are specifically allocated as
matt black to reduce internal reflections.</p>
<p>Plain
colours and simple combinations of colours are included as standard. Tri-colour
combinations such as camouflage colour schemes cost slightly more because they
must be stencilled, painted and baked three times as opposed to just once for
the simple colour schemes.</p>
<p>Custom
colour schemes are possible for no additional cost with the purchase of 10 or
more units as outlined in the <b>perks</b>
section. Additionally we are happy to work with contributors in the development
of a custom colour scheme of your making and can provide you with CAD
renderings of your desired colours &amp; patterns.</p>

THE PRODUCT
The FlatTops™
camera system is a portable, autonomous, wireless IP security camera for
outdoor applications. It consists of a state of the art 2 megapixel, 360 degree
IP Camera housed in a uniquely designed environmentally protective enclosure
which provides a 360 degree unencumbered field of view. In addition, the
FlatTops™ system incorporates an integrated photovoltaic panel and lithium
polymer battery cartridge that can provide electrical supply to operate the
system in conditions of low light or even in total darkness.
The
FlatTops™ camera system supports encrypted WiFi network connections and can
stream real time video to any supported network, including IP based
infrastructure and AdHoc Peer to Peer network structures.
Additionally,
the system can be configured to record imagery directly onto internal SD card
and can store up to a 14 day loop of continuous video whilst simultaneously
streaming video to a remote network or operating entirely isolated from a
network connection.
Stored
video recordings can be accessed remotely at any time using an encrypted WiFi
network connection or in situations of totally isolated operation, these
recordings can be rapidly downloaded using a laptop computer, tablet or
smartphone. For example a security officer or park ranger could simply download
the data from a series of remotely situated FlatTops™ camera devices from their
car every couple of weeks even if there was no permanent WiFi network
established in the area.


THE
PROJECT


The
objective of the project was to design a versatile IP camera based security
product that was portable and fully autonomous.
The system
had to be very quick and easy to install without requiring any physical
connections for electrical supply or data communication.
Additionally,
the system needed to be able to be set up as a temporary or semi-permanent installation
yet at the same time be relatively tamper proof, and offer advanced features and
accessibility from mobile devices such as smart phones, tablets etc. as well as
conventional PCs.
Data
communication was a relatively easy problem to solve through the use of WiFi
which is a well-established and reliable technology. Solar power was the
obvious choice for provision of electrical supply. However, many significant
difficulties existed in realizing an effective system utilizing solar power.
Although IP security cameras have relatively low power consumption which is
well within the capabilities of a medium-size solar panel, it must be
remembered that full sunlight is only available for a relatively short time
each day. Even in good conditions, a solar panel will only average about four
hours of peak performance over a 24-hour period.
Obviously,
batteries can be used to store energy during times of low light or night.
However, when you factor in all of the inefficiencies and energy losses
resulting from transferring energy to and from a battery bank as well as
providing DC voltage conversion and stabilisation in addition to non-optimal
alignment of the photovoltaic array with respect to the sun then the minimum
requirements for the solar panel become significantly higher than that of the
camera system alone.
Recent
developments in high-efficiency solar cells in combination with low-power, low
voltage IP camera technology has made this project a feasible reality.



APPLICATIONS

The
IP security camera represents a great step forward in the field of video-based
security. It offers significant advantages over its CCTV predecessor. In
particular its inherent ability to be monitored remotely via internet protocol
wired and wireless networks, utilising a diverse range of platform independent
software.  Additionally, its ability to
stream real-time video imagery to mobile devices such as smart phones has
changed the paradigm of the security industry from one of service provider
based monitored security to one of user monitored security.
However
for all of its obvious advantages, outdoor IP security cameras are still in the
domain of government organisations and large scale commercial security
installations. 
The
objectives of the FlatTops™ project is to deliver the performance of a hi-tech
permanent camera installation in a low cost, user installable package that is
both easy and quick to install and configure.
Because
of its inherent ease of setup, in addition to the security of the
semi-permanent mounting, the FlatTops™ camera system has a multitude of
immediate applications that many people would not have even considered.


House
Imagine
you are going on a trip and you want to make sure that the garden and swimming
pool are being taken care of while you're away.

Worksite
Imagine
you have hired contractors for a renovation on your house. You come home from
work to find they have done the job totally incorrectly. Without any clear
evidence of what really happened in your absence, what started out as a simple
renovation could quickly turn into a legal and insurance nightmare.
Additionally,
theft of building materials is a major problem with small to medium size sites.
The FlatTops™ security system can provide a powerful theft deterrent for a
fraction of the cost of a full time security guard.

Events
Imagine
that you are arranging an outdoor event with lots of people. An IP security
camera installation can complement ground staff and assist in providing both a
safe and lawful environment. Drugs, alcohol, violence all of these things are
much less likely to occur when somebody knows they are close to a camera.

Liability
Liability
is a major concern for just about everybody nowadays. Having this type of
recording security system would be a great benefit to many organisations. For
example, in the case an accident, injury, damage or theft occurring in a
parking lot. Simply being able to show evidence of what really occurred could
solve many disputes and possibly also assist police in apprehending those responsible.

Schoolyard
Imagine
you are operating a school or day care centre. There have been reports of
people loitering in the vicinity of the playground and the local park where the
children play. There are parents with obvious concerns about the situation, but
what can you do ? Setting up a temporary IP security camera goes a long way to
both alleviating the parent’s concerns and also in assisting local police in
identifying and apprehending any wrongdoer before something serious occurs.
With this system, all this can be achieved for a fraction of the cost of
appointing security personnel.


Wilderness
Park
Rangers or security guards could benefit from the placement of camera devices
in areas where problems such as illegal camping or damage to protected areas
and/ or trespassing is a frequent occurrence. FlatTops™ camera units could be
placed in hidden locations, even attached to trees. Recorded video files could
be periodically accessed and downloaded remotely by WiFi from the comfort of a
vehicle, without ever having to touch the camera device. Given that the
FlatTops™ camera system is solar powered and totally maintenance free it could
remain attached to a tree or other remote site indefinitely.



OPTIONAL
BASES

The FlatTops™ system
features a range of different interchangeable bases which are appropriate for
different situations.
The
product will be first launched with the versatile cylindrical “Picket Base” as
standard but other alternative bases can be easily retrofitted when they become
available through the FlatTops™ online store.

The
full range of bases that are envisaged are:

Tube Base:  For permanent mounting in concrete
Picket Base:  For semi-permanent mounting in soil
or sand
Weighted Base:  For temporary or portable applications
Flange Base:  For attachment to solid horizontal
surfaces 
Clamp Base:  For attachment to tubular structures
or solid vertical surfaces



COLOUR
SCHEMES



Various
colour schemes are available for the base, mast, and head sections of the FlatTops™
camera system. Some parts of the camera system are specifically allocated as
matt black to reduce internal reflections.
Plain
colours and simple combinations of colours are included as standard. Tri-colour
combinations such as camouflage colour schemes cost slightly more because they
must be stencilled, painted and baked three times as opposed to just once for
the simple colour schemes.
Custom
colour schemes are possible for no additional cost with the purchase of 10 or
more units as outlined in the perks
section. Additionally we are happy to work with contributors in the development
of a custom colour scheme of your making and can provide you with CAD
renderings of your desired colours & patterns.
To
use the Interactive colour selector on the website, first select the scene using the media icons on the media selector strip
and then flip through the colour choices
using the page selector controls on the lower portion of the screen.

Our program is made unique by its adherence not to the passing on of time-honored design methods, but marked by its spunk and devotion to raising the standards of the future. We are the future — we are the first graduating class.Because we are the first Product Design class at Drexel University, there is no precedent for how our senior show should be done. As such, we are creating this show from the ground up. We are responsible for organizing as well as fundraising. The money we raise will go towards event catering, promotions, poster printing, exhibition furniture, material costs, and putting the last finishing touches on our projects to make sure they really stand out.Alexa Forney: SpoonfulExploring the role of product design in social change, this project investigates using self-sufficient skills to improve the quality of life in low-income populations. In the wake of twelve months of original qualitative research, Spoonful attempts to democratize access to information and specialized ingredients in a population with limited budgets and limited access to technology, utilizing micro-kits to disseminate recipes and valuable information on self-sufficient habits.Bradley Seigel: A New DeskI set out on my senior project to redesign the office desk for more efficient and productive use. This modular flat-pack desk can be made out of many materials to fit any work space. For people that mainly use a computer, the desk can act more as a bookcase with shelves than a desk with drawers. For people that use a desktop computer, it can be rearranged to accommodate that efficiently as well. It can also be made out a wide range of materials.Nnaemeke Offodile: Helping Arthritic HandsMy goal is to lend a helping hand and provide both a product and a system that will change the realities of those with arthritis and allow them to live a less painful life. My system and product will incorporate proven methods of Arthritic treatments such as, moist heat therapy, cold therapy, massaging and stretching. The combination of these four methods will be delivered to all potential users through my product in a way that is easy to use, simple to understand, unobtrusive and, most importantly, designed with the user in mind.Jingqiao Wang: Design for Sports InjuryMy design concept delivers the right information for pre-professional soccer players to know exactly what they need to do and how to do them correctly in order to prevent injuries, improve their abilities to play soccer, and eventually help them to become better soccer players.Jacob Beadenkopf: DIY Shoes, no tools requiredBy creating a design for a shoe that can be assembled without need of any specialized tools and can be constructed out of any fabric, the ability to makes shoes for oneself is made available to many. Additionally, a visual design language has been established that can communicate the design and instructions with minimal written language, making it widely accessible. The final design is intended to allow those in need to make shoes for themselves, and to give those who are not in need an opportunity to reflect on their place in consumer society.Jordann Smith: Supporum, Helping Substance Abusers’ Loved OnesAddiction is a family disease that has been growing rapidly throughout our nation, but most people know little about it and are victim to the stigmas associated with addiction.  More methods are being created to help the addict, but addict’s loved ones have little to no options to cope. “Supporum” is a system that helps substance abusers’ loved ones learn about their illness, connect with others in similar situations, and heal through achieving self-empowerment.Mary DiPesa: Collaborative Space for Developing Neighborhood in South PhillyPoint Breeze, a historically underprivileged neighborhood in South Philadelphia, is approaching a breakthrough. This area needs a reliable community centered environment for sharing and implementing ideas. Utilizing a range of conceptual design and mixed media production, my thesis asks and attempts to answer questions like: What happens to human evolution when our built environments shift?Megan Peaslee: Reading with ArthritisInspired by people suffering with Rheumatoid Arthritis, this project tackles the issue of being unable to enjoy reading due to the effects of this disease.  This solution is inspired by a quilt and folds into a triangle, creating stand for a variety of books.  Along with supporting the weight of the book, the Acute Reader has features that aid in keeping the book open and turning the pages.Nick Kovacs: Musical Medicine ProjectMusic has been used as a healing force for centuries. Today Music Therapy is effective in treating people with a variety of developmental delays through the use of musical group exercises.  Therapists lead these group exercises to help improve patients focus, motor and social skills. Music therapists still use traditional music instruments, which are not designed for the severely mentally and physically handicapped.

The Story
Articulate started in 2013 when we launched our first Kickstarter project and it featured Men's inspired wallets. Due to the support, we have been able to continually sell this product through our website (www.articulatelifestyle.com). With the accessory market being saturated, it was our goal to come out with ideas that combined functionality, affordability and quality design. Our female inspired clutch falls right into what we are setting out to do; provide individuals with a product that is innovative and highly functional, all while adding a little bit of style to your everyday look.


We wanted this clutch to be:
- Stylish while also minimalist 
- Versatile with attention to design detailing
- Interchangeable
- Highly Functional
- RFID Blocking  (Learn more about RFID below)

<p>I started Violaceous Latex in April 2010. I bought a few meters of latex, made a couple of outfits for myself to go out in, got lots of lovely comments and asking where to buy... Then I set up my business without a real start up fund, working from a tiny table in my living room. Violaceous grew fast which I was really pleased with but the market it now very competitive and I would love to expand with new and exciting ideas!</p>

<h2><strong>What Violaceous Latex is looking for?</strong></h2>
<p>I am looking for £1500 to purchase a reliable new desk top laser cutter. </p>
<p>I would use the laser cutter to produce a new range of garments and accessories. This would be for latex and other materials too. </p>
<p>If the full target isn't reached the funds will go towards stocking more latex and getting the latex laser cut elsewhere. However it is more cost effective for my company to own a machine as Violaceous latex would be able to create any ideas with a much shorter waiting time and cost.</p>

<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>I run Violaceous Latex on my own and it can be very hard work. It’s not always very profitable as latex is expensive and testing new ideas can also be expensive too. Having my own machine would make the cost of producing new items with laser cut applique would be far more cost effective and in return will mean I can produce garments at a lower cost, as hand cutting is very time consuming and not always perfectly accurate with intricate designs, not to mention can be painful on your fingers and wrist!</p>

<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>Don't worry if you are unable to donate towards this fund, you can help in other ways too. </p>
<p>I would be very thankful if you could share this campaign with your friends, family via Facebook, twitter and other networking sites :)</p>

<h2>The Mobile Power System You did not Find in CES 2013</h2>
<p>Modern life has forced us to accept mobile devices as one of the most important accessory of our daily life.  Everywhere you go, you will find people staring at cell phone or tablet PC.  Even down at the beach, smart phone and tablet PC are a must besides beer and chips nowadays.</p>
<p>As we depend on mobile devices more and more, portable backup power source becomes indispensable more and more too.  Mobile devices runs on battery power.  It always runs out when you just need that little bit more.</p>
<p>JuiceCan(e) now comes to the rescue. Unlike most of the standard backup batteries which only serve its basic function of providing extra power when needed, JuiceCan(e) is colorful and fashionable by design; simply add more cans to become the cane for extending usage time; and replaceable utility cap to create application flexibility.</p>
<h1>Aesthetic Design</h1>
<p>JuiceCan(e) is not only colorful, but also fashionable.  A single JuiceCan is small in size, <span>7.5 fl oz can size, 7 oz. weight;</span> easy to hold in your hand.  Easy to carry in handbag for all occasions.<br/> JuiceCan comes in 7 natural fruit colors: milk<span class=""notranslate"">-white/ blackberry-black/ cherry-red/ strawberry-pink/ blueberry-blue/ aloe-green/ lemon-yellow.  Each standalone JuiceCan is noticeable by color. <br/> Turning single JuiceCan into JuiceCane can be as easy as making a twist.  </span><span class=""notranslate"">When multiple units connected, it becomes a very visible JuiceCane like sugarcane.</span></p>

The Mobile Power System You did not Find in CES 2013
Modern life has forced us to accept mobile devices as one of the most important accessory of our daily life.  Everywhere you go, you will find people staring at cell phone or tablet PC.  Even down at the beach, smart phone and tablet PC are a must besides beer and chips nowadays.
As we depend on mobile devices more and more, portable backup power source becomes indispensable more and more too.  Mobile devices runs on battery power.  It always runs out when you just need that little bit more.
JuiceCan(e) now comes to the rescue. Unlike most of the standard backup batteries which only serve its basic function of providing extra power when needed, JuiceCan(e) is colorful and fashionable by design; simply add more cans to become the cane for extending usage time; and replaceable utility cap to create application flexibility.
Aesthetic Design
JuiceCan(e) is not only colorful, but also fashionable.  A single JuiceCan is small in size, 7.5 fl oz can size, 7 oz. weight; easy to hold in your hand.  Easy to carry in handbag for all occasions. JuiceCan comes in 7 natural fruit colors: milk-white/ blackberry-black/ cherry-red/ strawberry-pink/ blueberry-blue/ aloe-green/ lemon-yellow.  Each standalone JuiceCan is noticeable by color.  Turning single JuiceCan into JuiceCane can be as easy as making a twist.  When multiple units connected, it becomes a very visible JuiceCane like sugarcane.

 

Functional Design
Each JuiceCan carries 7800mAh capacity;  enough to support 3 charges of iPhone5, or 2 charges of iPad.
Simply connect multiple JuiceCans will create a larger capacity power source to meet the longer capacity needs.



The standard removable Utility cap equips with two USB output ports, one micro USB charging port, and a 2.3W LED flashlight.  It can charge 2 mobile devices at the same time.  And also good to provide 200 hours of LED lighting.
 
Fun and Easy Technology
AMP design team has made this product with more fun and easy to use.  By adding more JuiceCans, not only it builds the fun of color match, but also increases the usage capacity of the battery.  Buy a few of the JuiceCans for all your family members.  Each JuiceCan will provide the simple function of the personal mobile backup power source.  When family get together, combine all units and create a JuiceCane to meet the large capacity demand.
Making the Best even Better
AMP Tech is in the process of designing more functional removable utility caps.  To name a few below: 1.  Warm and Romatic Lampshades:


2.  Body Massager
 3.  BlueTooth speaker
 4.  12V DC inverter for light car appliance

In short, JuiceCan(e) is a well-designed product with great creativity.  JuiceCan(e) proves that technology can be colorful and fashionable too.  Ease of use is definitely a must for all classes of users.  The removable utility cap creates the flexibility for all other features next to come. 


Lightning Reward (iPhone 5 not included):



Lightning to USB cable (8-pin),
Wall charger adapter (110V AC to 5V DC)

<p>Hi everyone! My name is Jacque and I am a senior at the University of Kansas. I created LIONESS <a href=""http://www.shoplioness.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.shoplioness.com/</a> last November for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was in college, lost, and completely broke. </li>
<li>I taught myself graphic design, html, and photography for my fashion blog (<a href=""http://www.the-lion-kingdom.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.the-lion-kingdom.com/</a>) and was spending hours on end sprucing it up and thrifting for my own closet.</li>
<li>I decided to take what I loved to do anyway and find a way to continue while making money for school!</li>
</ul>
<p> My campaign goal is to continue expanding LIONESS with new clothing, along with more vintage pieces. I will always love the 90's for it's pioneering spirit and presence of color in entertainment, so I will always keep the vintage pieces 90s, but I want LIONESS to be more than just that. I want it to be an affordable shop for girls who are a little bit on the quirky side and don't quite fit the Forever21 mold.  Girls who are fierce, fashionable, and fearless! Oh and money conscious because I definitely am haha.</p>
<p>And to be quite honest, LIONESS is doing as well as it can right now, but it's becoming too expensive for me to run in general let alone expand...but I have hope! Here's some items I would love to add:</p>

The money from this campaign will go to buying new merchandise, both new and vintage, along with buying some Google ad space.
