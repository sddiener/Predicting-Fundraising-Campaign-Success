This is a Flex Funding campaign, so even if we don't reach our goal of covering tuition for twelve campers, your contribution will still allow girls to attend rock camp for free. In exchange, we have some pretty sweet rock camp merch to send you, including buttons, T-shirts, and the very last hand printed QCRC schwag bags from the 2014 session! </p>

<h3><b>Get to Know my Project:</b></h3>
<p>I am launching my first solo E.P. titled “When it All Falls
Down.”  </p>
<p>In life, there are hard lessons, trials and seasons that everyone at some point in their lives wrestle with, some longer than others, and some at different stages or levels.  Loss - Grief - Disappointment - Doubt - The feeling of failure or the empty feeling of loneliness that each of these bring. </p>
<p>In this project, I really focus on writing into those places that hit a deep place of raw emotion and reflection. I write and sing about the need of hope, searching for revival, and <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">in the midst of these attacks to the heart; finding it.   </span></p>

<p>My prayer in faith is that the songs reflect a style of
writing that connects with many different people from many walks of
life and many different things, and meet them right where they are at.</p>

We have been a band for 5 years and  played many shows in LA and Orange County area. You have probably  seen our front women on shows like American Idol, Americas Got Talent and The X Factor. We now have an opportunity to record a full length album with Joel piper, Mikey Doling, and Dave Fortman as the producers - as well as tour the record. But we are an unsigned band MEANING we have no funding and we have to pay for everything on our own. This is difficult to do when we all work minimum wage jobs. We also really wanted to involve everyone that has been supporting us and anyone that would like to become a part of what we're doing. Together we can create some amazing things. The album is going to cost about 20,000. We Will want  to tour the record so we are going to need transportation. Our final cost will be 40,000 to make this happen. We have all decided that this is going to be our last shot to try to make this happen as we need to go to college and get started on our lives. So we are asking our friends &amp; fans to help us chase our dreams ONE LAST TIME and help us get a great album recorded for you and come to a city near you. We really need your support to make this happen and would really appreciate any help. We have awesome gifts for everyone that donates. Anything will help and, again, we really appreciate your time for reading this.

We now have an opportunity to record a full length album with Joel piper, Mikey Doling, and Dave Fortman as the producers - as well as tour the record. But we are an unsigned band MEANING we have no funding and we have to pay for everything on our own. This is difficult to do when we all work minimum wage jobs. We also really wanted to involve everyone that has been supporting us and anyone that would like to become a part of what we're doing. Together we can create some amazing things. The album is going to cost about 20,000. We Will want  to tour the record so we are going to need transportation. Our final cost will be 40,000 to make this happen. We have all decided that this is going to be our last shot to try to make this happen as we need to go to college and get started on our lives. So we are asking our friends & fans to help us chase our dreams ONE LAST TIME and help us get a great album recorded for you and come to a city near you. We really need your support to make this happen and would really appreciate any help. We have awesome gifts for everyone that donates. Anything will help and, again, we really appreciate your time for reading this.

</p><p><b>A little about Litha
Symphony Orchestra</b></p>
<p>Through invigorating
interpretations from the symphonic literature, as well as arrangements of works
realized anew, the Litha Symphony Orchestra is committed to bringing the
excitement and energy of summer to its audiences and musicians alike. We are
New York's Premier Summer Ensemble. </p>
<p>Litha Symphony Orchestra
was founded in the spring of 2012 by a group of musicians who wanted to create
a summer outlet for performing classical orchestral music in the New York
Metropolitan area during the summer, which is traditionally an off-season for
most musicians and orchestras in the area. As the full orchestra performs
mostly during the summer, the orchestra chose to use the name Litha after the
goddess of the summer solstice as the signature name for the organization. Maestro
Eric Hayslett has been at the helm of the orchestra since the premier season,
where he has led the orchestra through three full seasons featuring a variety
of orchestral hits. </p>
<p><b>Help us finance Litha
Symphony Orchestra!</b></p>
<p>It takes a whole lot of
hard work, conviction and determination to keep the Litha Symphony Orchestra
going each year. However, this is not enough! LSO needs a budget of $5,500 this
year to cover all expenses. Expenses are categorized as follows: Artist fees,
Artist travel and Accommodation expenses, Venue rentals, Promotion and
Advertising expenses, Technical expenses (sound, lighting, etc.), and much more.

<div>      We are extremely proud of where we come from. All of the Red Ember musicians stem from the same area. When we first got together to make music, we noticed a uniquely level plane we artistically find together, and Kentucky has a whole lot to do with it. Our inspirational home is rooted in the past and reaching for the brightest future; proudly creating bluegrass just as easily as powerhouse original bands from genres that couldn't be more diverse. This is not something that is easily nor frequently portrayed in contemporary pop culture, on the contrary, Kentucky can easily become the target or criticism and stereotypes, while the truth is so beautifully layered in our hearts and minds. We want to represent ourselves and our home in the proudest light, while showing through our music a universal vein in all people. We will put our true selves into this album, with an honest frame grounded in our upbringing, and solidified in the driving passions from Red Ember's members as a whole. In the end, we will show that even if your geographic home is different from ours, there is a undeniable universality between you and us, To keep ourselves close to our inspiration, all artist involved in this album, and all we do visually and beyond will be local artists. Made in Kentucky, by Kentuckians, for the world.<br/>

<p>We are Rebirth::Collective, an Antwerp (BE) based large jazz ensemble formed in 2010. In March 2016 we will release our second album ‘Raincheck’ wich will feature the famous Dutch guitar-player Jesse Van Ruller. This album will celebrate Billy Strayhorns 100th birthday.</p>
<p>Our previous release received very positive reactions of both public and press. But for our upcoming album, we want to take it a little bit further. We expanded from 8 to 9, and we invited Jesse Van Ruller as a guest soloist. </p>
<p>To make this ambitious project become reality, we have started a crowdfunding campaign of wich you can be part. Together with you we can realize this album! When we reach our goal of 4000EUR, we will be able to fund the recording, mixing, mastering and the musicians. </p>
<p>In exchange for your donations, you can receive a number of perks in return. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for your support!!!</p>
<p><b>About the project:</b></p>
<p>2015 will mark the year that one of the most original composers in jazz, Billy Strayhorn, would have celebrated his 100th birthday! Strayhorn helped produce a body of work that has no rival in originality and range—from unforgettable tunes and jazz melodies to orchestral suites and soundtracks. He was the sole composer of many classic compositions, including the Ellington theme song, “Take The ‘A’ Train,” and the widely recorded “Lush Life.” Rebirth::Collective will pay homage to this jazz giant with the help from an international icon of modern jazz guitar, Jesse Van Ruller.  Rebirth::Collective consists out of 6 horns and a rhythm section and therefore functions as a small bigband. These talented musicians form a powerful 9-piece ensemble and let the music evolve from sensitive ballads to burning uptempo music with deep grooving moments and exciting battles between the musicians. 50’s bop swings again, but this time with a contemporary drive.</p>
<p>They team up with Jesse van Ruller to do a fresh and innovating take on the Strayhorn songbook. Van Ruller won the Thelonious Monk Competition in Washington in 1995. The jury, consisting of Pat Metheny, John Scofield, Jim Hall, Pat Martino and Mark Whitfield, was of the opinion that van Ruller is one of the most promising talents of his time. Since then he has been recognized worldwide as one of the leading voices on his instrument and has performed with numerous renowned musicians and ensembles amongst which are George Duke, Joe Lovano, Pat Metheny, Peter Erskine, Mike Stern, Tom Harrell, Philip Catherine, Toots Thielemans, the Roy Hargrove Quintet, Christian McBride, Seamus Blake, Metropole Orchestra, Asko Ensemble, WDR Big Band, Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and the Berliner Philharmoniker.</p>
<p>The album tracks are:</p>
<p>01-Isfahan</p>
<p>02-UMMG</p>
<p>03-Chelsea Bridge</p>
<p>04-Raincheck</p>
<p>05-Johnny Come Lately</p>
<p>06-Lush Life</p>

We are Rebirth::Collective, an Antwerp (BE) based large jazz ensemble formed in 2010. In March 2016 we will release our second album ‘Raincheck’ wich will feature the famous Dutch guitar-player Jesse Van Ruller. This album will celebrate Billy Strayhorns 100th birthday.
Our previous release received very positive reactions of both public and press. But for our upcoming album, we want to take it a little bit further. We expanded from 8 to 9, and we invited Jesse Van Ruller as a guest soloist. 
To make this ambitious project become reality, we have started a crowdfunding campaign of wich you can be part. Together with you we can realize this album! When we reach our goal of 4000EUR, we will be able to fund the recording, mixing, mastering and the musicians. 
In exchange for your donations, you can receive a number of perks in return. 
Thank you so much for your support!!!
About the project:
2015 will mark the year that one of the most original composers in jazz, Billy Strayhorn, would have celebrated his 100th birthday! Strayhorn helped produce a body of work that has no rival in originality and range—from unforgettable tunes and jazz melodies to orchestral suites and soundtracks. He was the sole composer of many classic compositions, including the Ellington theme song, “Take The ‘A’ Train,” and the widely recorded “Lush Life.” Rebirth::Collective will pay homage to this jazz giant with the help from an international icon of modern jazz guitar, Jesse Van Ruller.  Rebirth::Collective consists out of 6 horns and a rhythm section and therefore functions as a small bigband. These talented musicians form a powerful 9-piece ensemble and let the music evolve from sensitive ballads to burning uptempo music with deep grooving moments and exciting battles between the musicians. 50’s bop swings again, but this time with a contemporary drive.
They team up with Jesse van Ruller to do a fresh and innovating take on the Strayhorn songbook. Van Ruller won the Thelonious Monk Competition in Washington in 1995. The jury, consisting of Pat Metheny, John Scofield, Jim Hall, Pat Martino and Mark Whitfield, was of the opinion that van Ruller is one of the most promising talents of his time. Since then he has been recognized worldwide as one of the leading voices on his instrument and has performed with numerous renowned musicians and ensembles amongst which are George Duke, Joe Lovano, Pat Metheny, Peter Erskine, Mike Stern, Tom Harrell, Philip Catherine, Toots Thielemans, the Roy Hargrove Quintet, Christian McBride, Seamus Blake, Metropole Orchestra, Asko Ensemble, WDR Big Band, Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and the Berliner Philharmoniker.
The album tracks are:
01-Isfahan
02-UMMG
03-Chelsea Bridge
04-Raincheck
05-Johnny Come Lately
06-Lush Life
07-Satin Dollhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWTRV0Uc-XA

In 2004, BRL pioneered one of the country’s first Hip Hop Therapy programs to utilize the process of creating positive hip hop music to engage at-promise youth in meaningful mental health services.  The success of BRL’s Hip Hop Therapy model is widely documented and has served youth in Oakland, San Francisco, and the South Bronx, New York. We equip marginalized youth with:





tools for success in school and in life


positive coping strategies


conflict resolution skills


avenues for creative expression


supportive networks


Since 2004, BRL has blossomed into an emerging social enterprise. As the foremost provider of Hip Hop Therapy, BRL is well positioned to meet the growing demand from systems of care for innovative programs that reduce stigma and promote wellness and recovery, especially among boys and young men of color. BRLHQ will serve as a center for this work.  We need your support to make this vital work happen.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, we're Brandon and Rob, otherwise known as the alternative rock band Chair Warriors. We've been performing around Montreal, Quebec since 2009 and have had our share of triumphs and challenges along the way. We signed with an indie record label and released our first EP <i>A Thousand Words</i> in 2012, but things <strike>went to shit</strike> didn't really work out. Fast forward three years and after lots of tireless struggling we're finally free from the shackles of our contract and ready to record again!</p>
<p>We're hoping this new EP will be the fresh start that we've been waiting for. We've come a long way over the past few years and it has shown in our music. Earlier this year we released a one-off single called ""Liars"" (highlighting some of our experiences with the music industry so far), but we have six new songs written, demoed and ready to be recorded properly!</p>We need you to help us get this project off the ground and fuel our new found independence. We are truly more inspired and motivated than ever to share our music with the world and we want you to become part of our journey from this point forward. After all, we've already come this far. Why not join us the rest of the way?<br/> <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We're asking for $5,000 to cover the cost of recording, mixing and mastering six songs. Our studio time is already reserved with Kevin Jardine of Uplift Recording Studio, so there's no turning back now. Leftover funds will be put towards pressing CDs and creating cool and stylish merch like t-shirts, sweaters and caps.</p>
<p>Our perks will include physical copies of the new EP, both signed and unsigned, as well as copies of our first EP A Thousand Words, merch products and a few more surprises.</p>
<p>It would be great to reach our goal, but if we don't...Rob will have to sell his car. This bad boy is getting done one way or another ;)<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have a plan and nothing is going to get in our way. After finishing this EP we will:</p>
<p>1) Make it available across all major digital platforms (iTunes, Amazon, all major streaming services, etc.) through TuneCore. There will also be a small 500-1000 copy run of physical CDs made to be sold at shows (and to be sent out as perks of course).<br/></p>
<p>2) Focus heavily on promoting the album online via social media, using behind-the-scenes content and music videos to push songs and expand the target audience.</p>
<p>3) Tour Eastern Canada (primarily Quebec and Ontario) in collaboration with our good friends at Landmark Events and Sincop8ed Noize Inc.</p>
<p>4) Produce videos for several songs with Front To Back Video Productions, which has already worked with us on the “Liars” video. The founder is Chris Kells, bassist of Century Media band The Agonist.</p>
<p>5) Secure support on stations historically supportive of the band: university radio stations CJLO (Concordia) and CKUT (McGill) plus commercial station CHOM 97.7, specifically the highly-respected ""Montreal Rocks"" show with Jay Walker, and 99.9 The Buzz “Homebrew” (covering Burlington, Plattsburgh, Montreal).<br/></p>Sounds great, right? Well we need YOU to help us take the first step in this long-term project of ours.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We won't pretend like this is going to be easy. We paid for our first EP out of pocket only to watch it rot away on the shelves without a proper marketing plan or support of any kind from our record label. But this time will be different.</p>
<p>With your help to cover the costs of recording, we'll be able to invest more time, money and energy into promoting our EP and making sure it's heard by as many people as possible. Using our ever-growing social media presence (by the way, follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram) to generate buzz for the release and hype for the subsequent music videos, we'll be able to reach more fans than ever. We now have what it takes to give our music a fighting chance to survive out 
there in the wasteland that is our contemporary musical landscape. </p>
<p>The Bottom Line: We've faced enough adversity to know the level of dedication it takes to bring a quality piece of music into the world. The recording studio is a high pressure environment, but we've been there, done that, and now we just want to do it our way; bigger and better with more tools in our arsenal. <br/></p>

<p>Just as a young Miles Davis was mentored by Dizzy Gillespie, he 
similarly mentored a 26-year old burgeoning young Robert Irving III in 
1979. In-kind, Irving has been nurturing the next generation of young 
jazz players since 2007 as a professional mentor with the Jazz Institute
 of Chicago.  Last May 2014, near the time of Irving's annual Miles Davis birthday tribute (normally performed with alums from the Davis band), Irving's wife, <b>Laurence d'Estival Irving</b> insisted that it was time for Robert to give his mentees the same performance experiences that he received from Miles by making them an actual part of his band.  <b>Laurence d'Estival Irving</b>'s brilliant Idea soon evolved into a creative concept that gave birth to the group, ""Generations"" as a vehicle 
to both, showcase these extraordinary young musicians, while creating a workshop for the development of expansive new music composed and arranged by Robert Irving III for the group.
</p>Irving says,  ""This campaign is important to me because, despite my long resume in the 
music business, most of my work has been behind the scenes in support of
 other artists and as a youth mentor. As a result, I have only two official releases under my 
own name in a 30-year career.  In this sense, this project is my ""coming 
out"" of sorts... I'm a late-bloomer.  Generations is a dream band for me because of the 
high level of musicianship of the players and their willingness to 
explore beyond traditional or even contemporary forms of jazz 
expressionism. My compositions often defy categorization and can be 
challenging to execute, but these young musicians work exceptionally 
hard to interpret my ideas while also bringing their own unique personal
 artistic spirit to the music.” The personnel of Generations is more
 than qualified to do this:<br/><br/><br/><h3>BAND MEMBERS<br/>
</h3>
<p>Irving’s spouse, Group Co-Creator/Conceptualist/Producer and alto saxophonist, <b>Laurence d'Estival Irving</b>, who is a native of Paris, has performed 
with George Clinton, Fred Wesley 
and Pee Wee Ellis, Archie Shepp, David Murray and Roy Ayers. Drummer, <b>Charles “Rick” Heath IV</b> (Irving’s cousin) is 
currently a member of the Ramsey Lewis Group and performs with Dee 
Dee Bridgewater, Philip Bailey (EW&amp;F) and played the Oprah Winfrey musical production of The Color 
Purple. Generations bassist, <b>Emma Dayhuff </b>is a recording engineer and 
producer of recordings for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in addition to
 being in high demand as a bassist across genres from jazz to country music. 
Guitarist, <b>Scott Hesse</b> is a music educator who has performed 
internationally with Dee Alexander’s Evolution Ensemble, Stafford James 
String Ensemble and the Victor Garcia Organ Group. The two Jazz 
Institute mentees of Robert Irving III, tenor saxophonist, <b>Irvin 
Pierce </b>(age 20) and  soprano saxophonist/flutist, <b>Rajiv Halim </b>(age 24) are both leading their own groups as highly recognized 
‘young jazz lions’ who have been compared to John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley respectively. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>PRESS<br/>
</h3>
<b>Chicago Tribune columnist Howard Reich</b> recently wrote, ""<i>You can 
perceive the beauty and ingenuity of Irving's music whenever he places 
his fingertips on the keyboard, his voicing and chord constructions as 
surprising as they are expressive... this (Generations) could be his 
next major vehicle, if so, it could be a fascinating one...""  <br/>""...Irving's spouse moved from Paris to Chicago in July and soon became a key figure in the band...""<br/><br/></i><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>IN TUNE</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434762753/pdnvcycrm9zghn4nvswv.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 205.481px; height: 108px;""/></p>
<br/>Irving 
offers, “Another thing that makes this group unique is our tuning 
system. We <i><b>tune at the frequency of 432 hertz </b></i>rather than the western 
standard of 440 hz. There is extensive research that shows that 432 hz 
promotes a sense of well-being and balance, whereas 440 hz. creates 
tension. Living in a world that is so much on edge, anything that can possibly make even a small difference in reducing stress, should be embraced and explored.” Fans of Robert Irving III Generations invariably comment that they were 
‘blessed’ by the sound and harmonic expansiveness of the band. For this 
reason the band’s performance experience has been dubbed as “jazz 
church.” <br/><br/><b><i>This earlier incarnation of the band features Bob Davis on guitar.  The tune,<br/>""Every Today"" is inspired by the idea that, in some, African cultures, there is<br/>no words or concept for yesterday or tomorrow... all is one continuous today!</i></b><br/><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fvideoseries%3Flist%3DPLW6aBHohemgzBc12C8MhOkftwCKaDGTE0&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZpEwih3blhw%26list%3DPLW6aBHohemgzBc12C8MhOkftwCKaDGTE0&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FZpEwih3blhw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>STATUS AND PLAN<br/>
</h3>Robert Irving III Generations debut CD project is in the 
pre-production stage with 14-original compositions in development.  The 
band plans to pre-release the debut CD to  Indiegogo supporters and to local audiences during their Chicago Jazz Festival 
Performance at Millennium Park on September 6, 2015 at 3:30 pm on the Von Freeman Pavilion Stage.  An national release will follow two months later (as a three month pre-marketing lead time is needed for national releases). In order to fulfill this release schedule the group will need to begin recording immediately at the end date of this Indiegogo campaign.<br/><h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Win/Win Proposal<br/>
</h3>
</div><div>
<ul> <li>
<b>PROJECT OVERVIEW: </b>The record industry we once knew no longer exists, and so alternative funding platforms fill the void allowing artists to continue creating works of value and to deliver that value creation to the world.  85% of the minimum campaign goal is earmarked for hard cost of: studio production include tracking, editing, mixing and mastering; toward video archiving, photography, graphic design and art concepts for the CD and supporting website and towards manufacturing (CD's and Download cards... Vinyl pressing is on our wish list if we exceed the goals), marketing (media campaign managed by a publicist, advertising etc.) and promotion (radio campaign conducted by professional  radio promoter) and subsequent promotional performance support.  Additional hard costs include fulfillment expenses (cost of mailing product to:  print media, radio, Indiegogo supporters, and the fulfillment of perks that require travel and/or other associated costs). Only 15% is to be allocated for musician fees and only if we reach the minimum goal.   <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>A PEEK AT PERKS:</b> Everyone who gives receives something.  We are excited to offer many <b>unique, generous and useful perk packages</b>. Some of these are designed for Universities (Master's Classes), Individual Students (which you can gift) and Businesses  (Corporate Sponsorship).  Even if you select ""Unconditional Giving"" you get the satisfaction of truly making a difference in the sharing of new music with the world... music that has been uplifting audiences during every performance.</li>
</ul>
<ul> <li>
<b>DISASTER PLAN:</b> If we don't reach our minimum goal, the funds received will be used to complete the first steps of the production process with the alternative goal of doing a digital only release with other ""must have"" items to be decided upon based on the resources that are available.  <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<b>OVER-THE-TOP-BONUS PLAN:</b>  Because we've been developing enough music for two CD's, it is more cost 
effective to record all the music in one project and thus have enough to
 eventually release a subsequent CD (depending on resources). This <b>second CD </b>will be also be 
<b>pre-released in the Spring of 2016 to all contributors</b> with at no additional cost if we reach 
the  required threshold. Exceeding our goals will also allow the band to produce music videos and multi-media content for live performances. We will provide more detailed updates throughout the campaign.  <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact of Your Gift</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Recording a CD is like taking all this collective value creation and putting it into a <i><b>time capsule that’s available for Generations to come</b></i>.  Your gift helps to <b>make history and make you a part of creating the jazz legacies!</b>  A central part of the concept of the group is about <i><b>mentoring young jazz musicians and giving them a voice and a vehicle for expression</b></i>.  From time to time we invite other incredible young players to sub for the regular band members to expand the generational experience.   It is the participation of each contributor, no matter how large or small, that makes all this possible.  </p>
<p><br/></p>

However, if you are on a tight budget for the next thirty days, you can, nevertheless, help us get the word out to others via email, phone conversations and social media using the 'share tools"" provided here on Indiegogo.  <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434768210/avfibbvapc4mxy2ock4j.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Robert Irving III-Generations, led by 9-year Miles Davis collaborator, formed less than one-year ago, has rapidly grown in popularity and demand throughout the Chicagoland area.  Having recently completed a two-month run at the legendary Andy's Jazz Club, the group will, with your help, record this debut CD for pre-release on the band's one-year anniversary at their scheduled performance at the Chicago Jazz Festival on September 6, 2015 at 3:30pm at Millennium Park on the Von Freeman Pavilion Stage.

PERSONNEL
The bandleader, Robert Irving III pianist/composer/producer, is a 
recipient of the 2015 Chicago Music Awards Lifetime Achievement Award, and a nine year collaborator with Miles Davis and his wife, Paris France native, alto saxophonist, Laurence 
d’Estival Irving is group Co-Creator and Conceptualist/Producer. The band includes Rajiv Halim-soprano sax/flute, Irvin Pierce-tenor 
sax, Scott Hesse-guitar, acoustic & electric 
bass/vocals, Emma Dayhuff and Charles Heath-drums, 


BIO
Robert Irving III served as Miles Davis pianist/keyboardist
 and who proved to be his longest collaborator as a composer, arranger, 
producer and musical director (from 1979 to 1988).  As a musician and as producer of five Grammy Award nominated 
projects, Irving worked closely with numerous music greats including, 
Carlos Santana, Wayne Shorter, Ramsey Lewis, Billy Joel, Terri Lyne 
Carrington, Diane Reeves, David Murray, Doudou N'Diaye Rose, Regina 
Carter, Gary Bartz, Pharaoh Sanders, John Scofield, Kirk Whalum, Sting, 
Grover Washington Jr, Nona Hendricks, George Duke, Patrice Rushen, Nancy
 Wilson, Branford Marsalis, Roy Ayers, R. Kelly and also served as musical 
director for  the group, Sister Sledge, for trumpeter, Donald 
Bryd  and for The Last Poets (40th Anniversary in Paris, France),Check Out This Short Documentary Video To Learn More About The Group!STORY
Just as a young Miles Davis was mentored by Dizzy Gillespie, he 
similarly mentored a 26-year old burgeoning young Robert Irving III in 
1979. In-kind, Irving has been nurturing the next generation of young 
jazz players since 2007 as a professional mentor with the Jazz Institute
 of Chicago.  Last May 2014, near the time of Irving's annual Miles Davis birthday tribute (normally performed with alums from the Davis band), Irving's wife, Laurence d'Estival Irving insisted that it was time for Robert to give his mentees the same performance experiences that he received from Miles by making them an actual part of his band.  Laurence d'Estival Irving's brilliant Idea soon evolved into a creative concept that gave birth to the group, ""Generations"" as a vehicle 
to both, showcase these extraordinary young musicians, while creating a workshop for the development of expansive new music composed and arranged by Robert Irving III for the group.
Irving says,  ""This campaign is important to me because, despite my long resume in the 
music business, most of my work has been behind the scenes in support of
 other artists and as a youth mentor. As a result, I have only two official releases under my 
own name in a 30-year career.  In this sense, this project is my ""coming 
out"" of sorts... I'm a late-bloomer.  Generations is a dream band for me because of the 
high level of musicianship of the players and their willingness to 
explore beyond traditional or even contemporary forms of jazz 
expressionism. My compositions often defy categorization and can be 
challenging to execute, but these young musicians work exceptionally 
hard to interpret my ideas while also bringing their own unique personal
 artistic spirit to the music.” The personnel of Generations is more
 than qualified to do this:BAND MEMBERS

Irving’s spouse, Group Co-Creator/Conceptualist/Producer and alto saxophonist, Laurence d'Estival Irving, who is a native of Paris, has performed 
with George Clinton, Fred Wesley 
and Pee Wee Ellis, Archie Shepp, David Murray and Roy Ayers. Drummer, Charles “Rick” Heath IV (Irving’s cousin) is 
currently a member of the Ramsey Lewis Group and performs with Dee 
Dee Bridgewater, Philip Bailey (EW&F) and played the Oprah Winfrey musical production of The Color 
Purple. Generations bassist, Emma Dayhuff is a recording engineer and 
producer of recordings for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in addition to
 being in high demand as a bassist across genres from jazz to country music. 
Guitarist, Scott Hesse is a music educator who has performed 
internationally with Dee Alexander’s Evolution Ensemble, Stafford James 
String Ensemble and the Victor Garcia Organ Group. The two Jazz 
Institute mentees of Robert Irving III, tenor saxophonist, Irvin 
Pierce (age 20) and  soprano saxophonist/flutist, Rajiv Halim (age 24) are both leading their own groups as highly recognized 
‘young jazz lions’ who have been compared to John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley respectively. 


PRESS

Chicago Tribune columnist Howard Reich recently wrote, ""You can 
perceive the beauty and ingenuity of Irving's music whenever he places 
his fingertips on the keyboard, his voicing and chord constructions as 
surprising as they are expressive... this (Generations) could be his 
next major vehicle, if so, it could be a fascinating one...""  ""...Irving's spouse moved from Paris to Chicago in July and soon became a key figure in the band...""

IN TUNE

Irving 
offers, “Another thing that makes this group unique is our tuning 
system. We tune at the frequency of 432 hertz rather than the western 
standard of 440 hz. There is extensive research that shows that 432 hz 
promotes a sense of well-being and balance, whereas 440 hz. creates 
tension. Living in a world that is so much on edge, anything that can possibly make even a small difference in reducing stress, should be embraced and explored.” Fans of Robert Irving III Generations invariably comment that they were 
‘blessed’ by the sound and harmonic expansiveness of the band. For this 
reason the band’s performance experience has been dubbed as “jazz 
church.” This earlier incarnation of the band features Bob Davis on guitar.  The tune,""Every Today"" is inspired by the idea that, in some, African cultures, there isno words or concept for yesterday or tomorrow... all is one continuous today!

STATUS AND PLAN
Robert Irving III Generations debut CD project is in the 
pre-production stage with 14-original compositions in development.  The 
band plans to pre-release the debut CD to  Indiegogo supporters and to local audiences during their Chicago Jazz Festival 
Performance at Millennium Park on September 6, 2015 at 3:30 pm on the Von Freeman Pavilion Stage.  An national release will follow two months later (as a three month pre-marketing lead time is needed for national releases). In order to fulfill this release schedule the group will need to begin recording immediately at the end date of this Indiegogo campaign.
Win/Win Proposal


 
PROJECT OVERVIEW: The record industry we once knew no longer exists, and so alternative funding platforms fill the void allowing artists to continue creating works of value and to deliver that value creation to the world.  85% of the minimum campaign goal is earmarked for hard cost of: studio production include tracking, editing, mixing and mastering; toward video archiving, photography, graphic design and art concepts for the CD and supporting website and towards manufacturing (CD's and Download cards... Vinyl pressing is on our wish list if we exceed the goals), marketing (media campaign managed by a publicist, advertising etc.) and promotion (radio campaign conducted by professional  radio promoter) and subsequent promotional performance support.  Additional hard costs include fulfillment expenses (cost of mailing product to:  print media, radio, Indiegogo supporters, and the fulfillment of perks that require travel and/or other associated costs). Only 15% is to be allocated for musician fees and only if we reach the minimum goal.   


A PEEK AT PERKS: Everyone who gives receives something.  We are excited to offer many unique, generous and useful perk packages. Some of these are designed for Universities (Master's Classes), Individual Students (which you can gift) and Businesses  (Corporate Sponsorship).  Even if you select ""Unconditional Giving"" you get the satisfaction of truly making a difference in the sharing of new music with the world... music that has been uplifting audiences during every performance.

 
DISASTER PLAN: If we don't reach our minimum goal, the funds received will be used to complete the first steps of the production process with the alternative goal of doing a digital only release with other ""must have"" items to be decided upon based on the resources that are available.  



 
OVER-THE-TOP-BONUS PLAN:  Because we've been developing enough music for two CD's, it is more cost 
effective to record all the music in one project and thus have enough to
 eventually release a subsequent CD (depending on resources). This second CD will be also be 
pre-released in the Spring of 2016 to all contributors with at no additional cost if we reach 
the  required threshold. Exceeding our goals will also allow the band to produce music videos and multi-media content for live performances. We will provide more detailed updates throughout the campaign.  




The Impact of Your Gift


Recording a CD is like taking all this collective value creation and putting it into a time capsule that’s available for Generations to come.  Your gift helps to make history and make you a part of creating the jazz legacies!  A central part of the concept of the group is about mentoring young jazz musicians and giving them a voice and a vehicle for expression.  From time to time we invite other incredible young players to sub for the regular band members to expand the generational experience.   It is the participation of each contributor, no matter how large or small, that makes all this possible.  

    Other Ways You Can HelpIf you have read this far, of course, you are interested in our project. However, if you are on a tight budget for the next thirty days, you can, nevertheless, help us get the word out to others via email, phone conversations and social media using the 'share tools"" provided here on Indiegogo.  
                     We truly thank you for your support of our campaign!!!!!!!

My family history extends back four generations in the Sunshine State. I grew up listening to stories about how my family coped with living in a place that most people considered the edge of civilization at the time. In many ways, the state has been shaped by the persistence and stamina of those who chose to live in an environment that was challenging to say the least. Today, Florida is primarily known as a vacation destination but underlying the tourist economy is a whole universe of historical stories that are virtually unknown. My goal as a singer/songwriter is to document this rich heritage of Florida in an entertaining and engaging way that will appeal to listeners no matter where they live.  </span><br/></p></div>
<p></p>
<h1><b>The Project</b></h1><p></p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The genesis for the project started over a year ago when I was reflecting on my musical goals. Up to this point my music had been primarily focused on writing and performing music in church. I had a full time career spanning nearly 20 years and had produced 2 CDs and a single, and had a few of my religious songs published. I felt that I had accomplished a lot but still wanted to push my musical boundaries beyond the box I had made for myself. So, I began to research some of the stories about Florida that I had heard as a child and write songs about those stories. </span><br/></p><div>
</div><div>My first two songs about Florida history were: </div><div>
<b>""City of Hawkinsville""</b> &amp; <b>""I Think of You""</b>
</div><div>
<div>Based upon the enthusiasm of my small circle of fans, I knew those two songs were going to be the beginning of my first Folk music project. In March of 2015, I began a Kickstarter Campaign to raise money. </div>
<div>The campaign was technically a failure since it did not reach the intended goal of $10,000. However, three important things happened as a result:</div>
<div>1. The 63 backers contributed anyway.<br/>
</div>
<div>2. I was able to connect with producer, Nick Coetzee, owner of Rain Music Studio. <a href=""http://www.rainmusic.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.rainmusic.org</a>
</div>
<div>3. I was able to book and afford recording time at Nashville's prestigious Watershed Recording Studio.  <a href=""http://watershedrecording.wix.com/watershedrecordingstudio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://watershedrecording.wix.com/watershedrecordingstudio</a>
</div>
<div>These developments were an important milestone in my career as an artist  because for the first time my music was being arranged/produced by some of the best musicians in the world. Here is the list:</div>
<div>
<b>Mark Burchfield</b>, Bass; <b>Wanda Vick Burchfield</b>, Guitar, Dobro, Banjo, Fiddle; <b>Nick Coetzee,</b> piano; <b>Ken Lewis</b>, percussion, drums; <b>Jim Deneen</b>, recording engineer; <b>Ben Smith</b>, assistant recording engineer.</div>
<div>Googling any one of those names will bring up a comprehensive who's-who list of nationally known Country, Rock, Pop and Christian artists.</div>
<div>
<h1>How You Can Help</h1>
<div>So far, I have accomplished a lot. Ten songs are recorded and they sound awesome! However, the CD still needs to be professionally mixed down. I will be using <b>Grammy Award </b>winner, <b>Ronnie Brookshire,</b> to create amazing mixes. In addition, mastering, CD artwork, photos and physical production of the CDs still need to be paid out. In truth the $5,000 goal I have set will only cover about 1/2 of the remaining costs associated with this project. There are a wide variety of perks to choose from. Based upon my experience from the previous campaign, small amounts do add up quickly. Please take a look at the perks and choose one that fits your budget.

My name is George Lower. I'm a singer/songwriter who has a passion for the culture and history of the great state of Florida. My family history extends back four generations in the Sunshine State. I grew up listening to stories about how my family coped with living in a place that most people considered the edge of civilization at the time. In many ways, the state has been shaped by the persistence and stamina of those who chose to live in an environment that was challenging to say the least. Today, Florida is primarily known as a vacation destination but underlying the tourist economy is a whole universe of historical stories that are virtually unknown. My goal as a singer/songwriter is to document this rich heritage of Florida in an entertaining and engaging way that will appeal to listeners no matter where they live.  

The ProjectThe genesis for the project started over a year ago when I was reflecting on my musical goals. Up to this point my music had been primarily focused on writing and performing music in church. I had a full time career spanning nearly 20 years and had produced 2 CDs and a single, and had a few of my religious songs published. I felt that I had accomplished a lot but still wanted to push my musical boundaries beyond the box I had made for myself. So, I began to research some of the stories about Florida that I had heard as a child and write songs about those stories. 
My first two songs about Florida history were: 
""City of Hawkinsville"" & ""I Think of You""

Based upon the enthusiasm of my small circle of fans, I knew those two songs were going to be the beginning of my first Folk music project. In March of 2015, I began a Kickstarter Campaign to raise money. 
The campaign was technically a failure since it did not reach the intended goal of $10,000. However, three important things happened as a result:
1. The 63 backers contributed anyway.

2. I was able to connect with producer, Nick Coetzee, owner of Rain Music Studio. www.rainmusic.org

3. I was able to book and afford recording time at Nashville's prestigious Watershed Recording Studio.  http://watershedrecording.wix.com/watershedrecordingstudio

These developments were an important milestone in my career as an artist  because for the first time my music was being arranged/produced by some of the best musicians in the world. Here is the list:

Mark Burchfield, Bass; Wanda Vick Burchfield, Guitar, Dobro, Banjo, Fiddle; Nick Coetzee, piano; Ken Lewis, percussion, drums; Jim Deneen, recording engineer; Ben Smith, assistant recording engineer.
Googling any one of those names will bring up a comprehensive who's-who list of nationally known Country, Rock, Pop and Christian artists.

How You Can Help
So far, I have accomplished a lot. Ten songs are recorded and they sound awesome! However, the CD still needs to be professionally mixed down. I will be using Grammy Award winner, Ronnie Brookshire, to create amazing mixes. In addition, mastering, CD artwork, photos and physical production of the CDs still need to be paid out. In truth the $5,000 goal I have set will only cover about 1/2 of the remaining costs associated with this project. There are a wide variety of perks to choose from. Based upon my experience from the previous campaign, small amounts do add up quickly. Please take a look at the perks and choose one that fits your budget. Then click the link and back my project today!

</div>
<p></p><div align=""justify""> Hi, I am <b>Guillaume Cazenave</b> and for more than 15 years, I've been writing <b>novels</b>, <b>short stories</b> and <b>screenplays</b>. I also <b>illustrate books</b>, direct <b>short films and commercials</b>, and most importantly, I make <b>records</b>. Composing music seduces and fulfills me. I can express myself <b>freely</b> without artistic boundaries, allowing my creativity free reign.</div>
<p></p><div align=""justify""> However, the last few years were almost exclusively dedicated to film production (a man’s got to eat!) and it’s been 9 years since my last record “<b>Second System Syndrome</b>” was released. But since late 2013 I’ve decided to stop producing films and instead focus exclusively on music. After more than 4 years of work, I have finally finished my 5th album, “<b>the Odd Galant</b>”, but to be honest, it feels like the 1st one. I invested <b>so much of myself</b> in it, way more than I ever did before.</div>
<p></p>
<p></p><div align=""justify""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438620144/ymhwhr8tlc3msmw3wdva.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p><div align=""justify"">“The Odd Galant A-M” is based on a <b>particular concept</b>. The letters A and M refer to the 13 tracks composing the album. The 1st song is called A, the 2nd  B, the 3rd C and the last one is called M. As you can guess there will be another album released in a few months and it will be called “<b>The Odd Gallant N-Z</b>”, to finish the <b>alphabet</b>. But why are the titles of the songs letters of the alphabet? The lyrics of each song push the concept further. The lyrics in song A all start with an A (Almost, Again, Always, Alone… ), the ones in the song B all start with the letter B (Breathe, Before, Becoming…) and so on…The aim was to orientate the texts towards obvious themes whilst simplifying the writing process and listening experience.  However writing the songs proved really difficult. But at the end, I think that it <b>served the project</b>: I had to work harder than ever and <b>pushed through my limits</b>. And for the 1st time since I began to compose music, I am entirely satisfied with the work. It took a lot of time and sweat but I am very happy with the result. Now that I have started the whole project, the second album “N-Z” will be released soon (not in 9 years time!) and it will be, I hope, very surprising.</div>
<p></p><div align=""justify"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438897207/kbofgmuwmcsag7ubyptq.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 417.425742574257px; height: 255px;""/><br/>
</div>
<p></p><div align=""justify"">Let’s talk about the <b>title</b> now: “The Odd Gallant”. The idea of this title is to evoke the idea that we are all motivated by the need to seduce. However, our culture, education, and social conventions can often make <b>seduction</b> appear weird and odd. This can also be true for artistic pieces. “A-M” is based on this idea. Its music tries to seduce but still remains odd and a bit difficult to understand sometimes. It is after a few listens, I think, that it will reveal its true nature. I leave it to you to discover it, if you‘re curious, adventurous and interested. Now, a quick word about my influences: it goes from the eccentricity of <b>Devin Townsend</b> and the versatility of <b>Mike Patton</b> to the cold precision of <b>King Crimson</b>. Some atmospheres will remind you of <b>Gong</b>, <b>Magma</b> and the inevitable <b>Pink Floyd</b>.</div>

<p></p><div align=""justify""><b>The Indiegogo campaign:</b></div>
<p></p><div align=""justify"">Today, the album is <b>FINISHED</b>. The next steps are the <b>pressing</b>, the <b>manufacturing</b> and the <b>duplicating</b> of the album, as well as the promotion. At the beginning and unlike my other albums, I didn’t want to associate with a distributor. Indeed I thought that a digital version of it was more appropriate. I wanted to sell the record via <b>Cd Baby</b> so that it would be available on Amazon, iTunes, Google play, etc. As the work on the album progressed, it became important and necessary to me to offer that album in a <b>physical version</b>, as I thought it would offer the listener the best experience. “A-M” is a <b>concept album</b> and it made more sense for it to exist properly; with a beautiful booklet and in a nice case. For a piece whose main theme is seduction it was paramount to offer a closer and more concrete interaction with the listener. The budget planned for the project at the beginning was way under the one needed at the end: this is why I’m running this Indiegogo campaign today. I invite you to watch the <b>presentation video</b> above. There, I explain the goals and advantages of that crowd funding.</div>
<p></p><div align=""justify"">Your money will be used to pay for:</div>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>The first pressing</b> of the album “The Odd Galant A-M” in a <b>digifile format</b> (500 copies), cost <b>$1250</b>
</li>
<li>
<b>The promotional costs</b> (press, leaflets, t-shirts, posters…), cost <b>1000$</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p><div align=""justify"">If the money collected is more than the amount expected, any extras will go towards the <b>making of the second album</b> (guests, recording, mastering…) But with the limit of <b>150%</b> (so 3,375$). <b>Everything above will be given to the charity Asperger Aide</b>, a beautiful charity fighting to inform and sensitize people, authorities and institutions about the <b>Asperger Syndrome</b>. And finally the use of Indiegogo makes the <b>whole process transparent and honest</b> which convinced me even more. </div>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p></p><div align=""justify"">About the perks: they are really <b>simple</b> because I wanted things to be clear. The only perk which could be a bit surprising is the <b>70$</b> one as I offer you the opportunity to <b>appear in the booklet</b> of the second album as well as credited.

<h3></h3>
</div><p>Bonjour,</p>
<p></p><div align=""justify"">Je m’appelle <b>Guillaume Cazenave</b>, j’habite en France et, depuis plus de 15 ans, j’écris des <b>romans</b>, des <b>nouvelles</b>, des<b> scénarios</b>, j’illustre des <b>livres</b>, je réalise des <b>courts métrages</b> ou des <b>films publicitaires</b> et, surtout, je compose et produis des <b>disques</b>… En toute franchise, c’est cette dernière activité qui me séduit et me comble le plus, de
loin, car contrairement aux autres précitées, qui souvent s’apparentent à des «commandes»,
c’est la seule (avec peut-être les romans ?) dans laquelle je peux m’exprimer
<b>librement</b>, sans limite « artistique », et où ma créativité et mes
compétences s’expriment au mieux.</div>
<p></p><div align=""justify"">Pour autant, les dernières années étaient presque
exclusivement consacrées à des projets audiovisuels (alimentaires) et 9 ans se
sont écoulés depuis <b>Second System Syndrome</b>, mon précédent projet musical personnel. Or depuis fin 2013, j’ai décidé de mettre un terme aux activités professionnelles liées à l’audiovisuel afin de me consacrer uniquement à la musique. Et, après plus de 4 ans de production, je viens enfin de terminer mon dernier album, <b>The Odd Gallant - AM</b>, et j’en suis le plus soulagé des hommes. AM est mon cinquième disque mais j’ai presque l’impression qu’il s’agit du premier tant j’ai surmultiplié <b>les efforts</b> pour parvenir à l’achever.
</div>
<p></p>
<p></p><div align=""justify""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438620144/ymhwhr8tlc3msmw3wdva.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p><div align=""justify"">Il faut dire, « The Odd Gallant – AM » fonctionne
selon un principe plutôt… <b>particulier</b>. Les lettres « AM » font référence aux
13 morceaux qui composent le disque. Le premier morceau s’appelle A, le deuxième
B, le troisième C, et le dernier a pour titre « M ». Comme vous le
devinez, un autre album sortira dans quelques mois et, parce qu’il sera
constitué des morceaux N à Z, il complètera AM pour proposer un « <b>alphabet
complet</b> » de morceaux. Ce second album s’appellera, évidemment, « <b>NZ</b> ».
Mais pourquoi donc les « chansons » de ce projet
ont pour titre les lettres de l’alphabet ? » Pour une raison simple,
c’est que les textes de ces chansons repoussent le concept un peu plus loin.
Voyez : les mots employés et chantés dans le morceau A commencent tous par
la lettre A (almost, again, always, alone…), ceux de la lettre B par la lettre
B (Breathe, before, becoming…), etc. L’objectif était d’orienter les textes vers
des thèmes évidents tout en permettant de simplifier le travail d’écriture et
de compréhension. Autant l’avouer, le calcul était mauvais et l’écriture de ce
disque s’est avérée, de fait, très compliquée. Mais au final je considère que cette
contrainte a été <b>profitable</b> au projet et à la proposition musicale que je vous
fais : j’ai dû m’acharner comme un diable pour <b>dépasser mes limites</b>. Et
pour la première fois depuis que je compose des disques, je suis entièrement satisfait
du travail accompli. Certes il aura fallu du temps, BEAUCOUP de temps et de
sueur, mais je ne regrette pas une seconde… Et puis, de toute façon, maintenant que je suis sur ma lancée, NZ arrivera très prochainement (PAS DU TOUT DANS 9 ans), et il
sera – j’ose espérer – encore plus surprenant.</div>
<p></p><div align=""justify"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438897207/kbofgmuwmcsag7ubyptq.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 417.425742574257px; height: 255px;""/><br/>
</div>
<p></p><div align=""justify"">Parlons un peu du choix du <b>titre</b> : « The Odd
Gallant ». C'est-à-dire, le « galant étrange ». Ces deux termes
inaugurent donc une « nouvelle série » puisque j’envisage de signer
sous cette appellation tous mes prochains disques, et pas seulement AM et NZ. L’idée
de ce « nom », c’est d’évoquer le fait que nous sommes tous des « êtres
motivés par le besoin de séduire autrui (et donc soi-même)» mais que notre
culture, notre éducation, notre savoir et quantité de conventions sociales font
en sorte qu’aux yeux d’autrui, tout comportement lié à la <b>séduction</b> peut paraître
le plus souvent « étrange » ou « bizarre ». Et ce constat
s’applique aussi aux œuvres artistiques car elles véhiculent aussi cet objectif
de séduction. « AM » est impulsé par cette idée fondatrice. Sa
musique cherche à séduire, elle n’en est pas moins bizarre, étrange… ce qui la rend,
peut-être, difficile à décrypter. Et c’est après quelques écoutes, je
crois, qu’elle révèle sa vraie nature. Je vous laisse découvrir cela, si vous
êtes intéressés, et aventureux… Quant aux influences, elle sont nombreuses et  réunissent, pour les plus récentes, l’excentricité de <strong>Devin Townsend</strong>, la précision froide de <strong>King Crimson</strong> ou encore la versatilité de <strong>Mike Patton</strong>, sans oublier peut-être certaines atmosphères qui peuvent évoquer des groupes tels que <strong>Gong</strong>, <strong>Magma</strong> ou encore l’inévitable <strong>Pink Floyd.</strong> </div>

<br/>
<p></p><div align=""justify""><b>La campagne Indiegogo :</b></div>
<p></p><div align=""justify"">À ce jour, l’album est <b>TERMINÉ</b>. Composé, enregistré,
mixé et masterisé. Les prochaines étapes concernent donc le <b>pressage/duplication</b>
et la <b>promotion</b> du disque. Au commencement de ce projet, et à la différence de mes
autres albums, je ne souhaitais pas  m’associer
à un distributeur. La raison en était simple : seule une diffusion
numérique me semblait appropriée. J’avais donc dans l’idée de faire
commercialiser l’album via <b>Cd Baby</b>, ou autre prestataire de ce type, de façon à
ce que le disque soit disponible sur Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, et toutes les plateformes principales
consacrées à la musique digitale. À l’époque, les coûts associés à un disque
physique me paraissait évitable. Or, au fur et à mesure que le projet se
développait, il m’est apparu important et même nécessaire de proposer le disque
dans une <b>version physique </b>parce que c’est dans ce format-là que la découverte
de la musique serait la plus confortable et donc la meilleure. « AM »
est un <b>album concept</b> et il m’a semblé approprié qu’il existe réellement, avec
un beau livret, dans un beau boîtier concret. En toute modestie, pour une « œuvre »
dont le thème principal s’articule autour de la séduction, il était presque
inévitable, finalement, d’assurer une proximité physique avec un éventuel
auditeur charmé. Vous comprenez donc : le budget prévu au départ était
bien moindre que celui envisagé à l’arrivée. D’où le recourt à une campagne
Indiegogo. À ce propos, je vous invite à visualiser la <b>vidéo</b> de présentation ci-dessus, j’y explique davantage l’intérêt et les objectifs de ce financement participatif. </div>
<p></p><div align=""justify"">L’argent collecté servira donc à financer :</div>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
le <b>premier pressage</b> de « The Odd
Gallant – AM » en format <b>digifile</b> (500 copies). Coût : <b>1250$.</b>
</li>
<li>
les <b>frais promotionnels</b> (envois presse, flyers, t-shirt, posters, etc.). Coût estimé :
<b>1000$</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div align=""justify"">Si la somme réunie dépasse le montant sollicité, le bénéfice sera alors employé dans la <b>production du deuxième disque</b> (guests, enregistrements, mastering).
Mais jusqu’à une <b>limite de 150%</b> (donc : 3375$). Au-delà, <b>tout excédent
sera reversé à l’association Asperger Aide</b>, magnifique association qui se bat
corps et âmes pour sensibiliser le grand public, les Autorités et les Institutions
au <b>Syndrome d’Asperger</b>. Le recourt à une campagne Indiegogo permet de réaliser
ce « process » dans la <b>plus grande transparence</b>. C’est aussi ce qui m’a
convaincu.</div>
<p></p>
<div align=""justify""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438895513/lzhyfyyzu9t7ldk1qgbv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<br/>
<p></p><div align=""justify"">À propos des contreparties, elles sont <b>simples</b> car je ne voulais pas surcharger et alourdir la campagne par des multiples propositions, qui auraient pu être « anecdotiques ». La seule qui
soit un peu surprenante est celle annoncée à <b>70$</b> puisque je vous propose d’intégrer
la<b> silhouette de votre visage</b> dans les livrets du prochain disque, NZ, en plus
de vous y créditer. Voici un aperçu du rendu tel qu’il est dans l’artwork de

 Hi, I am Guillaume Cazenave and for more than 15 years, I've been writing novels, short stories and screenplays. I also illustrate books, direct short films and commercials, and most importantly, I make records. Composing music seduces and fulfills me. I can express myself freely without artistic boundaries, allowing my creativity free reign.
 However, the last few years were almost exclusively dedicated to film production (a man’s got to eat!) and it’s been 9 years since my last record “Second System Syndrome” was released. But since late 2013 I’ve decided to stop producing films and instead focus exclusively on music. After more than 4 years of work, I have finally finished my 5th album, “the Odd Galant”, but to be honest, it feels like the 1st one. I invested so much of myself in it, way more than I ever did before.



“The Odd Galant A-M” is based on a particular concept. The letters A and M refer to the 13 tracks composing the album. The 1st song is called A, the 2nd  B, the 3rd C and the last one is called M. As you can guess there will be another album released in a few months and it will be called “The Odd Gallant N-Z”, to finish the alphabet. But why are the titles of the songs letters of the alphabet? The lyrics of each song push the concept further. The lyrics in song A all start with an A (Almost, Again, Always, Alone… ), the ones in the song B all start with the letter B (Breathe, Before, Becoming…) and so on…The aim was to orientate the texts towards obvious themes whilst simplifying the writing process and listening experience.  However writing the songs proved really difficult. But at the end, I think that it served the project: I had to work harder than ever and pushed through my limits. And for the 1st time since I began to compose music, I am entirely satisfied with the work. It took a lot of time and sweat but I am very happy with the result. Now that I have started the whole project, the second album “N-Z” will be released soon (not in 9 years time!) and it will be, I hope, very surprising.



Let’s talk about the title now: “The Odd Gallant”. The idea of this title is to evoke the idea that we are all motivated by the need to seduce. However, our culture, education, and social conventions can often make seduction appear weird and odd. This can also be true for artistic pieces. “A-M” is based on this idea. Its music tries to seduce but still remains odd and a bit difficult to understand sometimes. It is after a few listens, I think, that it will reveal its true nature. I leave it to you to discover it, if you‘re curious, adventurous and interested. Now, a quick word about my influences: it goes from the eccentricity of Devin Townsend and the versatility of Mike Patton to the cold precision of King Crimson. Some atmospheres will remind you of Gong, Magma and the inevitable Pink Floyd.



The Indiegogo campaign:
Today, the album is FINISHED. The next steps are the pressing, the manufacturing and the duplicating of the album, as well as the promotion. At the beginning and unlike my other albums, I didn’t want to associate with a distributor. Indeed I thought that a digital version of it was more appropriate. I wanted to sell the record via Cd Baby so that it would be available on Amazon, iTunes, Google play, etc. As the work on the album progressed, it became important and necessary to me to offer that album in a physical version, as I thought it would offer the listener the best experience. “A-M” is a concept album and it made more sense for it to exist properly; with a beautiful booklet and in a nice case. For a piece whose main theme is seduction it was paramount to offer a closer and more concrete interaction with the listener. The budget planned for the project at the beginning was way under the one needed at the end: this is why I’m running this Indiegogo campaign today. I invite you to watch the presentation video above. There, I explain the goals and advantages of that crowd funding.
Your money will be used to pay for:



The first pressing of the album “The Odd Galant A-M” in a digifile format (500 copies), cost $1250


The promotional costs (press, leaflets, t-shirts, posters…), cost 1000$.


If the money collected is more than the amount expected, any extras will go towards the making of the second album (guests, recording, mastering…) But with the limit of 150% (so 3,375$). Everything above will be given to the charity Asperger Aide, a beautiful charity fighting to inform and sensitize people, authorities and institutions about the Asperger Syndrome. And finally the use of Indiegogo makes the whole process transparent and honest which convinced me even more. 



About the perks: they are really simple because I wanted things to be clear. The only perk which could be a bit surprising is the 70$ one as I offer you the opportunity to appear in the booklet of the second album as well as credited. Here is how it will look like:



The T-shirt looks like this:


To finish, I invite you to watch the video presentation, if you haven’t watched it already. And below, you can discover the teaser of the album:



You can as well listen to the first extract of the album, the song “C”. It is available on Soundcloud and on the website of The Odd Gallant. Of course you can share those links, songs and videos on any social network. :)
Please, do not hesitate to contact me (contacts details above), I’ll be more than happy to answer to your e-mails, questions and comments.

 Thank you so much for your interest in this project. And thanks to everybody who has been supporting me for the past few years and who keep on doing so in such an honorable way.

With a lot of respect, and with all my energy,
With Regards,
Guillaume Cazenave,

French


Bonjour,
Je m’appelle Guillaume Cazenave, j’habite en France et, depuis plus de 15 ans, j’écris des romans, des nouvelles, des scénarios, j’illustre des livres, je réalise des courts métrages ou des films publicitaires et, surtout, je compose et produis des disques… En toute franchise, c’est cette dernière activité qui me séduit et me comble le plus, de
loin, car contrairement aux autres précitées, qui souvent s’apparentent à des «commandes»,
c’est la seule (avec peut-être les romans ?) dans laquelle je peux m’exprimer
librement, sans limite « artistique », et où ma créativité et mes
compétences s’expriment au mieux.
Pour autant, les dernières années étaient presque
exclusivement consacrées à des projets audiovisuels (alimentaires) et 9 ans se
sont écoulés depuis Second System Syndrome, mon précédent projet musical personnel. Or depuis fin 2013, j’ai décidé de mettre un terme aux activités professionnelles liées à l’audiovisuel afin de me consacrer uniquement à la musique. Et, après plus de 4 ans de production, je viens enfin de terminer mon dernier album, The Odd Gallant - AM, et j’en suis le plus soulagé des hommes. AM est mon cinquième disque mais j’ai presque l’impression qu’il s’agit du premier tant j’ai surmultiplié les efforts pour parvenir à l’achever.




Il faut dire, « The Odd Gallant – AM » fonctionne
selon un principe plutôt… particulier. Les lettres « AM » font référence aux
13 morceaux qui composent le disque. Le premier morceau s’appelle A, le deuxième
B, le troisième C, et le dernier a pour titre « M ». Comme vous le
devinez, un autre album sortira dans quelques mois et, parce qu’il sera
constitué des morceaux N à Z, il complètera AM pour proposer un « alphabet
complet » de morceaux. Ce second album s’appellera, évidemment, « NZ ».
Mais pourquoi donc les « chansons » de ce projet
ont pour titre les lettres de l’alphabet ? » Pour une raison simple,
c’est que les textes de ces chansons repoussent le concept un peu plus loin.
Voyez : les mots employés et chantés dans le morceau A commencent tous par
la lettre A (almost, again, always, alone…), ceux de la lettre B par la lettre
B (Breathe, before, becoming…), etc. L’objectif était d’orienter les textes vers
des thèmes évidents tout en permettant de simplifier le travail d’écriture et
de compréhension. Autant l’avouer, le calcul était mauvais et l’écriture de ce
disque s’est avérée, de fait, très compliquée. Mais au final je considère que cette
contrainte a été profitable au projet et à la proposition musicale que je vous
fais : j’ai dû m’acharner comme un diable pour dépasser mes limites. Et
pour la première fois depuis que je compose des disques, je suis entièrement satisfait
du travail accompli. Certes il aura fallu du temps, BEAUCOUP de temps et de
sueur, mais je ne regrette pas une seconde… Et puis, de toute façon, maintenant que je suis sur ma lancée, NZ arrivera très prochainement (PAS DU TOUT DANS 9 ans), et il
sera – j’ose espérer – encore plus surprenant.



Parlons un peu du choix du titre : « The Odd
Gallant ». C'est-à-dire, le « galant étrange ». Ces deux termes
inaugurent donc une « nouvelle série » puisque j’envisage de signer
sous cette appellation tous mes prochains disques, et pas seulement AM et NZ. L’idée
de ce « nom », c’est d’évoquer le fait que nous sommes tous des « êtres
motivés par le besoin de séduire autrui (et donc soi-même)» mais que notre
culture, notre éducation, notre savoir et quantité de conventions sociales font
en sorte qu’aux yeux d’autrui, tout comportement lié à la séduction peut paraître
le plus souvent « étrange » ou « bizarre ». Et ce constat
s’applique aussi aux œuvres artistiques car elles véhiculent aussi cet objectif
de séduction. « AM » est impulsé par cette idée fondatrice. Sa
musique cherche à séduire, elle n’en est pas moins bizarre, étrange… ce qui la rend,
peut-être, difficile à décrypter. Et c’est après quelques écoutes, je
crois, qu’elle révèle sa vraie nature. Je vous laisse découvrir cela, si vous
êtes intéressés, et aventureux… Quant aux influences, elle sont nombreuses et  réunissent, pour les plus récentes, l’excentricité de Devin Townsend, la précision froide de King Crimson ou encore la versatilité de Mike Patton, sans oublier peut-être certaines atmosphères qui peuvent évoquer des groupes tels que Gong, Magma ou encore l’inévitable Pink Floyd. 



La campagne Indiegogo :
À ce jour, l’album est TERMINÉ. Composé, enregistré,
mixé et masterisé. Les prochaines étapes concernent donc le pressage/duplication
et la promotion du disque. Au commencement de ce projet, et à la différence de mes
autres albums, je ne souhaitais pas  m’associer
à un distributeur. La raison en était simple : seule une diffusion
numérique me semblait appropriée. J’avais donc dans l’idée de faire
commercialiser l’album via Cd Baby, ou autre prestataire de ce type, de façon à
ce que le disque soit disponible sur Amazon, iTunes, Google Play, et toutes les plateformes principales
consacrées à la musique digitale. À l’époque, les coûts associés à un disque
physique me paraissait évitable. Or, au fur et à mesure que le projet se
développait, il m’est apparu important et même nécessaire de proposer le disque
dans une version physique parce que c’est dans ce format-là que la découverte
de la musique serait la plus confortable et donc la meilleure. « AM »
est un album concept et il m’a semblé approprié qu’il existe réellement, avec
un beau livret, dans un beau boîtier concret. En toute modestie, pour une « œuvre »
dont le thème principal s’articule autour de la séduction, il était presque
inévitable, finalement, d’assurer une proximité physique avec un éventuel
auditeur charmé. Vous comprenez donc : le budget prévu au départ était
bien moindre que celui envisagé à l’arrivée. D’où le recourt à une campagne
Indiegogo. À ce propos, je vous invite à visualiser la vidéo de présentation ci-dessus, j’y explique davantage l’intérêt et les objectifs de ce financement participatif. 
L’argent collecté servira donc à financer :



le premier pressage de « The Odd
Gallant – AM » en format digifile (500 copies). Coût : 1250$.


les frais promotionnels (envois presse, flyers, t-shirt, posters, etc.). Coût estimé :
1000$




Si la somme réunie dépasse le montant sollicité, le bénéfice sera alors employé dans la production du deuxième disque (guests, enregistrements, mastering).
Mais jusqu’à une limite de 150% (donc : 3375$). Au-delà, tout excédent
sera reversé à l’association Asperger Aide, magnifique association qui se bat
corps et âmes pour sensibiliser le grand public, les Autorités et les Institutions
au Syndrome d’Asperger. Le recourt à une campagne Indiegogo permet de réaliser
ce « process » dans la plus grande transparence. C’est aussi ce qui m’a
convaincu.



À propos des contreparties, elles sont simples car je ne voulais pas surcharger et alourdir la campagne par des multiples propositions, qui auraient pu être « anecdotiques ». La seule qui
soit un peu surprenante est celle annoncée à 70$ puisque je vous propose d’intégrer
la silhouette de votre visage dans les livrets du prochain disque, NZ, en plus
de vous y créditer. Voici un aperçu du rendu tel qu’il est dans l’artwork de
AM :



Le T-shirt ressemble à ça :

<p>Once upon a time there lived three boys. One of
them lived in Dusseldorf, Germany, the second one - in Barcelona, Spain, and
the third boy could not even say where he was from, because countries changed
their names, and the third boy was moving constantly; so that he had no notion
of where his homeland was.</p>
<p>The long and the short of it was that after a
while the boys became musicians.</p>
<p>They didn’t use social networks. They had heard about each
other but never met until that summer. And they met once, these boys. Unhappy
they were, for none of them were doingwhat they wanted. And the first boy
said ‘I’m a good soundengineer, and I want to join an
independent music project’. The second one said ‘I’m playing bass guitar well’.
And I said – by the way, I was the third boy - ‘I’m so tired of performing and
I have a lot of musical material, so we could create something interesting in
the studio’. The third boy showed his new song, and the first and the second
boys liked it.</p>
<p>And everyone went home: the
first went to Germany, the second - to Spain, and the third went to the North.
Since then, they’ve been writing songs together, even though they cannot see
each other.</p>
<p>Perhaps not all of this was
exactly as I wrote. But it was almost like this. The story happened three
months ago.</p>

<p>I act under the pseudonym Paul Yatt.</p>
<p>You probably can break your tongue if you try to
pronounce my real name. I worry for your good health, so you may call me Paul
or Pavel - which one you like more. However, all of my solo works were released
and will be released under the name of Paul Yatt.</p>
<p>I'm 26 now and I've been making music for most
of my life. As a musician I mostly prefer guitar as main instrument, but I’m
good in playing keyboards and drums, too. I worked as a session musician,
arranger and composer and spent a lot of time in studios. I participated in
more than 200 performances – pop, rock, jazz, classical, but none of these
projects were mine. Now I'm starting a new musical project. And this is the
project this campaign is dedicated for.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443622767/o8ag9uvvsoktyfsk6bhk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Doesn't matter what instruments you're playing.
If you call yourself a musician, you should learn to see musical canvas first.
It took me years to understand this simple fact.</p>
<p>I often ask myself: why am I starting to create
my own material today? What was it, stopping me for all these years? Probably I
was not ready to be creative in the sense that I feel it.</p>
<p>I thought that the music band is just like a
football team. It’s like you’re waiting for the moment when your next movement
may help the common cause. I thought: “Do you have a guitar in your hands?
Well, don’t stand like a chair, play something already! Are you going to stand
the whole song with a guitar to play one note at the end of the song? “.</p>
<p>It was a totally wrong concept.</p>
<p>I’m recording another song right now and I’m
going to stand the whole song with a guitar to play one note at the end of the
song. Just because the song needs this. Just because the sound made before this
moment brings musical canvas to nothing.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444028054/sim21sapljsdeegeo0h2.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>There were many things that I didn't understand
immediately. I did not see that the voice is not just a means of conveying
text, but it is another musical instrument. Or the fact that you should sing
only about things you know well. You know, some modern songs about love were
written in the way like authors knew nothing about love. It makes me sad.</p>
<p>What is ‘Wawawa’ song about? You might think
that it is just a sort of joke, but it isn’t.  There are places you can go
to jail more easily than have a cigarette. Believe me, I know what I’m talking
about.</p>

<p>The most annoying thing I’ve ever heard during
my session musician career is “Dude, it sounds good, but not for our style.
They will not understand this”. Not for our style. Not for our format. Not for
our listeners.</p>
<p>I’m fed with this. I suggest to play with no
rules. No formats, no style frames. My listeners are the same as I am. All the
people are the same as we are. That is what about our album will be.</p>
<p>If we all, being children of different cultures,
hear the same things on this album I will consider our mission accomplished. I
promise to do my best for this.</p>

<p>We are not going to earn money for ourselves with
this campaign. But we have a clear view about the costs needed for creating a
good recording, because we all have been working in this area for a long time.</p>
<p>And it costs much more than we’re raising with
this campaign. Anyway, we invest our own money to this project, but our
financial resources are not unlimited. We cannot finish the work without your
help.</p>
<p>We have no illusions about our exclusivity.
There are a lot of good independent bands today, but you can help grow another
one.</p>

ton propre matériel que maintenant? Qu'est-ce qui t’avait arrêté pendant toutes

<p>Il y a beaucoup de choses que je ne comprenais pas immédiatement. Je ne
savais pas que la voix est non seulement un moyen de communiquer le texte, mais
un instrument de musique. Je ne savais pas qu’on ne pouvait chanter que sur ce
qu’on connaissait bien. Savez-vous que beaucoup de chansons d'amour modernes
sont écrits comme si leurs auteurs ne savent rien sur l'amour. Et c’est triste.</p>
<p>Quel est le sens de la chanson ""Wawawa""? Vous pourriez penser que
ceci est juste une blague, mais ce n’est pas le cas. Il y a des endroits où
aller en prison est plus facile que de fumer une cigarette. Croyez-moi, je sais

Einer von ihnen
lebte in Düsseldorf, Deutschland, der zweite - in Barcelona, Spanien, und der
dritte, der dritte konnte selbst nicht sagen, woher er kommt , da der Junge so
oft umgezogen hatte, dass der Begriff Heimatsland für ihn nicht mehr

<p>Lang oder kurz, aber die drei Jungs sind
erwachsen geworden und wurden Musiker.</p>
<p>Sie benutzen keine sozialen Netzwerke. Sie
hörten von einander, aber haben sich bis zu diesem Sommer noch nie getroffen.
So trafen sie sich, die Jungs. Der Erste sagte: ""Ich arbeite schon lange als
Tontechniker und würde mich gerne zu einem eigenständigen Projekt anschließen"".
Der Zweite sagte: ""Ich bin ein guter E-Bassist"". Und ich sagte – weil ich der
Dritte in dieser Gruppe war: ""Jungs, ich bin von Auftritten erschöpft, und habe
so viel Material, dass wir etwas Eigenständiges im Studio aufnehmen könnten"".
Der Dritte zeigte ihnen seinen Song und es gefiel den beiden.</p>
<p>So gingen sie nach Hause, der Erste nach
Deutschland, der Zweite nach Spanien und der Dritte - nach Norden. Seitdem

Instrument Du spielst. Nennst Du dich ein Musiker? So, das Erste, was Du dann
lernen musst, ist das Sehen der musikalischen Leinwand. Ich brauchte Jahre, um
diese einfache Tatsache zu verstehen.</p>
<p>Ich frage mich oft: Warum hast du erst jetzt
angefangen, sich mit eigenem Material zu beschäftigen? Was hielt dich all diese
Jahre zurück? Ich glaube, dass ich zu Kreativität in der Einsicht, die ich
jetzt habe, noch nicht bereit war.</p>
<p>Früher dachte ich, dass eine Band - so etwas
wie eine Fußballmannschaft ist. Es wäre so, als würdest du  einen Moment erwarten, in dem dein Einsatz die
ganze Mannschaft nach vorne bringt. Ich dachte: ""Du hast eine Gitarre in
der Hand, nicht wahr? Dann steh doch nicht so rum, als wärst du nur ein
Möbelstück, spiel etwas! Oder hast du vor, das ganze Lied mit der Gitarre zu
stehen, um nur am Ende eine Note zu spielen? "".</p>
<p>Das war ein absolut falsches Konzept.</p>
<p>Jetzt nehme ich einen anderen Song auf. Und
diesmal werde ich den ganzen Song mit der Gitarre stehen, um eine einzige Note
am Ende zu spielen. Einfach, weil der Song das so verlangt. Einfach, weil ein
zuvorkommender Ton die musikalische Leinwand zerreißen würde.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444028054/sim21sapljsdeegeo0h2.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>Es gibt viele Dinge, die ich nicht gleich
verstanden habe. Mir war es nicht bewusst, dass die Stimme - nicht nur  Kommunikationsmittel ist, sondern auch ein
Musikinstrument. Ich verstand nicht, dass man nur darüber  singen kann, was man gut kennt. Wissen Sie,
viele moderne Liebeslieder sind so geschrieben, als wüssten ihre Verfasser
nichts über die Liebe. Und das ist traurig.</p>

Worüber ist  Lied ""Wawawa""? Man könnte denken,
dass dies nur ein Spaß sei, aber es ist nicht so. Es gibt Orte, wo es einfacher
ist, ins Gefängnis zu gelangen, als eine Zigarette zu rauchen. Glauben Sie mir,
ich weiß, worüber ich rede.<br/><p></p><p></p><div>

<p>Die lästigste Phrase, die ich hörte, als ich
als Session-Spieler arbeitete, war: ""Mann, das klingt toll, aber das ist
nicht unser Stil. Die werden es nicht verstehen. "" Nicht für u<span>nseren Stil. Nicht für
unseren Format. Nicht für unsere Zuhörer.</span></p>
<p>Ich habe es satt. Ich schlage vor, ohne Regeln

ich. Alle Menschen sind gleich, wie wir. Darüber wird dieses Album sein.</p>
<p>Wenn wir alle, als Kinder unterschiedlicher

</div></div>","Once upon a time there lived three boys. One of
them lived in Dusseldorf, Germany, the second one - in Barcelona, Spain, and
the third boy could not even say where he was from, because countries changed
their names, and the third boy was moving constantly; so that he had no notion
of where his homeland was.
The long and the short of it was that after a
while the boys became musicians.
They didn’t use social networks. They had heard about each
other but never met until that summer. And they met once, these boys. Unhappy
they were, for none of them were doingwhat they wanted. And the first boy
said ‘I’m a good soundengineer, and I want to join an
independent music project’. The second one said ‘I’m playing bass guitar well’.
And I said – by the way, I was the third boy - ‘I’m so tired of performing and
I have a lot of musical material, so we could create something interesting in
the studio’. The third boy showed his new song, and the first and the second
boys liked it.
And everyone went home: the
first went to Germany, the second - to Spain, and the third went to the North.
Since then, they’ve been writing songs together, even though they cannot see
each other.
Perhaps not all of this was
exactly as I wrote. But it was almost like this. The story happened three
months ago.





I act under the pseudonym Paul Yatt.
You probably can break your tongue if you try to
pronounce my real name. I worry for your good health, so you may call me Paul
or Pavel - which one you like more. However, all of my solo works were released
and will be released under the name of Paul Yatt.
I'm 26 now and I've been making music for most
of my life. As a musician I mostly prefer guitar as main instrument, but I’m
good in playing keyboards and drums, too. I worked as a session musician,
arranger and composer and spent a lot of time in studios. I participated in
more than 200 performances – pop, rock, jazz, classical, but none of these
projects were mine. Now I'm starting a new musical project. And this is the
project this campaign is dedicated for.



Doesn't matter what instruments you're playing.
If you call yourself a musician, you should learn to see musical canvas first.
It took me years to understand this simple fact.
I often ask myself: why am I starting to create
my own material today? What was it, stopping me for all these years? Probably I
was not ready to be creative in the sense that I feel it.
I thought that the music band is just like a
football team. It’s like you’re waiting for the moment when your next movement
may help the common cause. I thought: “Do you have a guitar in your hands?
Well, don’t stand like a chair, play something already! Are you going to stand
the whole song with a guitar to play one note at the end of the song? “.
It was a totally wrong concept.
I’m recording another song right now and I’m
going to stand the whole song with a guitar to play one note at the end of the
song. Just because the song needs this. Just because the sound made before this
moment brings musical canvas to nothing.


There were many things that I didn't understand
immediately. I did not see that the voice is not just a means of conveying
text, but it is another musical instrument. Or the fact that you should sing
only about things you know well. You know, some modern songs about love were
written in the way like authors knew nothing about love. It makes me sad.
What is ‘Wawawa’ song about? You might think
that it is just a sort of joke, but it isn’t.  There are places you can go
to jail more easily than have a cigarette. Believe me, I know what I’m talking
about.









The most annoying thing I’ve ever heard during
my session musician career is “Dude, it sounds good, but not for our style.
They will not understand this”. Not for our style. Not for our format. Not for
our listeners.
I’m fed with this. I suggest to play with no
rules. No formats, no style frames. My listeners are the same as I am. All the
people are the same as we are. That is what about our album will be.
If we all, being children of different cultures,
hear the same things on this album I will consider our mission accomplished. I
promise to do my best for this.




















We are not going to earn money for ourselves with
this campaign. But we have a clear view about the costs needed for creating a
good recording, because we all have been working in this area for a long time.
And it costs much more than we’re raising with
this campaign. Anyway, we invest our own money to this project, but our
financial resources are not unlimited. We cannot finish the work without your
help.
We have no illusions about our exclusivity.
There are a lot of good independent bands today, but you can help grow another
one.



Il était
une fois trois garçons. Un d'entre eux vivait à Düsseldorf, en Allemagne, le
deuxième - à Barcelone, en Espagne, et le troisième ne pouvait même pas dire d’où

chanson et elle a plu au premier et au deuxième.

se sont rentrés chez eux, l’un est allé en Allemagne, l’autre - en Espagne et

ne se voyaient pas.

que musicien, je suis un guitariste avant tout, mais je suis aussi un bon
batteur et claviériste. Je travaille en tant que musicien de session, arrangeur
et compositeur, j’avais passé beaucoup de temps dans les studios
d'enregistrement. J’ai participé à plus de 200 concerts - pop, rock, jazz,
classique - mais aucun de ces projets était le mien. Récemment j’ai commencé à
travailler sur mon propre projet musical. Cette campagne lui est consacré.
Il n'y a pas d'importance quel instrument vous jouez. Si vous vous appelez
un musicien, la première chose que vous devez apprendre, c’est de voir la toile
musicale. Il m'a fallu des années pour comprendre ce fait simple.
Je me demande souvent: «Pourquoi n’as-tu commencé de travailler sur
ton propre matériel que maintenant? Qu'est-ce qui t’avait arrêté pendant toutes
ces années?» Je suppose que je n’étais pas prêt à faire preuve de créativité
dans le sens que j’en vois maintenant.
Avant, je pensais que le groupe était quelque chose comme une équipe de
football. Tu bouges les membres en prévision du moment où ton prochain
mouvement peut aider la cause commune. Je pensais : «Tu as une guitare
dans tes mains, non? Eh bien, joue quelque chose! Ou tu vas te tenir droit toute la chanson avec une guitare pour
jouer juste une note à la fin?»
C’était un concept absolument erroné.
Maintenant, je suis en train d’écrire une autre chanson. Et je vais rester
toute la chanson avec une guitare dans mes mains pour jouer juste une note à la
fin. Tout simplement parce que la chanson l’exige. Tout simplement parce qu’un son
venu en premier va frapper toute la toile musicale.
Il y a beaucoup de choses que je ne comprenais pas immédiatement. Je ne
savais pas que la voix est non seulement un moyen de communiquer le texte, mais
un instrument de musique. Je ne savais pas qu’on ne pouvait chanter que sur ce
qu’on connaissait bien. Savez-vous que beaucoup de chansons d'amour modernes
sont écrits comme si leurs auteurs ne savent rien sur l'amour. Et c’est triste.
Quel est le sens de la chanson ""Wawawa""? Vous pourriez penser que
ceci est juste une blague, mais ce n’est pas le cas. Il y a des endroits où
aller en prison est plus facile que de fumer une cigarette. Croyez-moi, je sais
de quoi je parle.


Une phrase la plus pénible pour moi, c’est celle que j’ai entendu quand je
travaillais en tant que musicien de session : «Mec, ça sonne bien,
mais pas pour notre style. On ne nous comprendrait pas». Pas pour notre
style. Pas pour notre format. Pas pour notre publique.
J’en ai assez. Je suggère de jouer sans règles. Sans aucun format, sans limitations
de style. Mon publique est le même que moi. Tous sont les mêmes que nous
sommes. Voilà est l’idée principale de cet album.
Si chacun d'entre nous, comme on est tous les enfants des cultures
différentes, entendait la même chose sur cet album, je considérerais ma mission
accomplie. Et je promets de faire tout mon possible pour le faire.On ne va pas faire de l'argent avec cette campagne pour nous-mêmes. Mais on a une idée claire des coûts nécessaires pour créer
l'enregistrement de haute qualité parce qu’on a tous beaucoup travaillé dans ce
domaine.
Cela coûte beaucoup plus que nous prévoyons de lever avec cette campagne.
En tout cas, nous investissons notre propre argent dans ce projet, mais nos
ressources ne sont pas illimitées. Sans votre aide, nous ne pourrions pas accomplir
ce travail.
On ne fait pas d'illusions sur notre exclusivité. Il y a plusieurs excellents
projets de musique indépendante et vous pouvez aider à se faire développer un
de plus.


Es waren einmal drei Jungs. Einer von ihnen
lebte in Düsseldorf, Deutschland, der zweite - in Barcelona, Spanien, und der
dritte, der dritte konnte selbst nicht sagen, woher er kommt , da der Junge so
oft umgezogen hatte, dass der Begriff Heimatsland für ihn nicht mehr
existierte.
Lang oder kurz, aber die drei Jungs sind
erwachsen geworden und wurden Musiker.
Sie benutzen keine sozialen Netzwerke. Sie
hörten von einander, aber haben sich bis zu diesem Sommer noch nie getroffen.
So trafen sie sich, die Jungs. Der Erste sagte: ""Ich arbeite schon lange als
Tontechniker und würde mich gerne zu einem eigenständigen Projekt anschließen"".
Der Zweite sagte: ""Ich bin ein guter E-Bassist"". Und ich sagte – weil ich der
Dritte in dieser Gruppe war: ""Jungs, ich bin von Auftritten erschöpft, und habe
so viel Material, dass wir etwas Eigenständiges im Studio aufnehmen könnten"".
Der Dritte zeigte ihnen seinen Song und es gefiel den beiden.
So gingen sie nach Hause, der Erste nach
Deutschland, der Zweite nach Spanien und der Dritte - nach Norden. Seitdem
nehmen sie zusammen Songs auf,  obwohl
die einander nicht sehen.
Vielleicht war es alles nicht so, wie ich es
beschrieben habe. Aber es war fast so.
Und dies geschah vor drei Monaten.Ich arbeite unter dem Pseudonym Paul Yatt.
Sie würden sich die Zunge brechen, wenn Sie versuchen würden, meinen richtigen
Nahmen auszusprechen. Da mir aber Ihre Gesundheit nicht egal ist, können Sie
mich einfach Paul oder Pavel nennen, je nachdem, was Ihnen mehr gefällt. Wie
auch immer, sind alle meine Werke unter dem Namen Paul Yatt rausgekommen, und
es wird auch so weiter.
Ich bin 26 Jahre alt und mache den größten
Teil meines Lebens Musik. Als Musiker bin Ich in erster Linie ein Gitarrist, aber ich bin
auch ein guter Schlagzeuger
und Keyboarder. Ich arbeitete als Session-Musiker, Arrangeur und Komponist und
verbrachte viel meiner Zeit in Tonstudios. Ich nahm an mehr als 200
Aufführungen teil - Pop, Rock, Jazz, Klassik - aber keines dieser Projekte war
von mir. Und nun begann ich die Arbeit an meinem eigenen Musik-Projekt. Diesem
Projekt ist diese Kampagne gewidmet.Es spielt überhaupt keine Rolle, welches
Instrument Du spielst. Nennst Du dich ein Musiker? So, das Erste, was Du dann
lernen musst, ist das Sehen der musikalischen Leinwand. Ich brauchte Jahre, um
diese einfache Tatsache zu verstehen.
Ich frage mich oft: Warum hast du erst jetzt
angefangen, sich mit eigenem Material zu beschäftigen? Was hielt dich all diese
Jahre zurück? Ich glaube, dass ich zu Kreativität in der Einsicht, die ich
jetzt habe, noch nicht bereit war.
Früher dachte ich, dass eine Band - so etwas
wie eine Fußballmannschaft ist. Es wäre so, als würdest du  einen Moment erwarten, in dem dein Einsatz die
ganze Mannschaft nach vorne bringt. Ich dachte: ""Du hast eine Gitarre in
der Hand, nicht wahr? Dann steh doch nicht so rum, als wärst du nur ein
Möbelstück, spiel etwas! Oder hast du vor, das ganze Lied mit der Gitarre zu
stehen, um nur am Ende eine Note zu spielen? "".
Das war ein absolut falsches Konzept.
Jetzt nehme ich einen anderen Song auf. Und
diesmal werde ich den ganzen Song mit der Gitarre stehen, um eine einzige Note
am Ende zu spielen. Einfach, weil der Song das so verlangt. Einfach, weil ein
zuvorkommender Ton die musikalische Leinwand zerreißen würde.
Es gibt viele Dinge, die ich nicht gleich
verstanden habe. Mir war es nicht bewusst, dass die Stimme - nicht nur  Kommunikationsmittel ist, sondern auch ein
Musikinstrument. Ich verstand nicht, dass man nur darüber  singen kann, was man gut kennt. Wissen Sie,
viele moderne Liebeslieder sind so geschrieben, als wüssten ihre Verfasser
nichts über die Liebe. Und das ist traurig.

Worüber ist  Lied ""Wawawa""? Man könnte denken,
dass dies nur ein Spaß sei, aber es ist nicht so. Es gibt Orte, wo es einfacher
ist, ins Gefängnis zu gelangen, als eine Zigarette zu rauchen. Glauben Sie mir,
ich weiß, worüber ich rede.


Die lästigste Phrase, die ich hörte, als ich
als Session-Spieler arbeitete, war: ""Mann, das klingt toll, aber das ist
nicht unser Stil. Die werden es nicht verstehen. "" Nicht für unseren Stil. Nicht für
unseren Format. Nicht für unsere Zuhörer.
Ich habe es satt. Ich schlage vor, ohne Regeln
zu spielen. Kein Format, keine Stileinschränkungen. Meine Zuhörer sind so, wie
ich. Alle Menschen sind gleich, wie wir. Darüber wird dieses Album sein.
Wenn wir alle, als Kinder unterschiedlicher
Kulturen, das Gleiche aus dem Album raushören - dann ist meine Mission erfüllt.
Und ich verspreche, alles Mögliche dafür zu tun.















Mit dieser Kampagne wollen wir kein Geld verdienen. Aber wir haben eine klare Vorstellung davon, welche
Kosten erforderlich sind, um eine hochwertige Aufnahmen zu erstellen, weil wir
alle schon lange in diesem Bereich tätig sind. 
Und es kostet viel mehr, als wir planen, mit
dieser Kampagne zu sammeln.  In jedem
Fall,  investieren wir eigenes Geld in
das Projekt, doch sind unsere Ressourcen nicht unbegrenzt. Ohne Ihre Hilfe
können wir die Arbeit nicht vollenden.
Wir haben keine Illusionen, was unsere
Exklusivität angeht. Es gibt viele großartige selbstständige Musikprojekte, und
Sie können einem dieser Projekte helfen, sich zu entwickeln.",51.0,3,"1 Campaign

</h3>
<p>Hello fans, friends, and music
lovers,</p>
<p>I am back in the studio recording my 5th studio album and am looking forward to sharing my journey during this
next musical project with you.</p>
<p>Our lives are marked by milestones<span>-special moments in time. As a
musician, I give myself to those <b>Moments </b>through my life energy which is
embodied through my melodies, lyrics and chords to stir the audience’s soul.
One comment I make at every concert is how <b>music moves people! </b>It is truly the universal language.</span></p>
<p><b>Moments</b> also define us as individuals. On this upcoming album, I
will be sharing some of my life’s most memorable experiences to date to create
an uplifting, positive and engaging listening experience for people of all
ages. That aspect of my music, and how I live my life day to day will never
change, and that's a promise I keep to myself, my family and all those around
me. My life mantra is: </p>
<p><b>B</b><b>alance<span>, Energy, Laughter, Love, (B.E.L.L.) the 4 key
ingredients to strive for to achieve a Limitless
life!</span></b></p>
<p><b><u>About
this album:</u></b></p>
<p>As with my past work, this new album
will put a groove into your step and a smile on your face. We’ll be serving up
an eclectic mix of smooth, funky, edgy and infectious contemporary instrumental
grooves. Featuring a stellar line up of my local Toronto band members, studio musicians
and special guest artists from the contemporary jazz, pop and world music scene,
like: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Grammy nominee and Soul Train Award winning co-producer <b>Nate
Harasim</b></p></li>
<li><p>Multiple Juno and Canadian Smooth Jazz Award winner <b>Gabriel
Mark Hasselbach</b></p></li>
<li><p>World Guitarist extraordinaire <b>Steve Oliver</b></p></li>
<li><p>And more special guest collaborations (TBA), so stay tuned
for more exciting artist announcements!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>With Contemporary Pop, Jazz, World,
Latin, Acoustic, Electric guitar overtones, a couple of new vocal based songs I
have written, this new album will achieve a fresh mix of exciting music and
finely-crafted songs recorded live in the studio with the amazing musicians
mentioned above. </p>
<p>Our goal is to create musical <b>Moments</b>
to share with you and that you will enjoy for years to come! </p>
<p><b><u>Why I need your help and support:</u></b></p>
<p>The music
industry has undergone radical changes in recent years. Record companies no
longer fund new albums, because the revenue from music sales has essentially
dried up.<b> As an independent recording artist with no record company support,
album costs are my responsibility from start to finish, so I need to raise the funds
required to cover recording/production /studio musician costs for this new
album, which will be released in late Fall, 2015. </b></p>
<p><b>My funding target is $15,000, </b>which after deducting cost of
perks and Indiegogo fees will leave me with just enough to get this project
done. That may sound like a lot of money, but you’d be surprised how quickly it
gets consumed during the album-making process and every penny needs to be spent
wisely for maximum benefit.</p>

<p><b>You can help by pledging your
support.</b> I have
created some perks/incentives to encourage your support. The more you give, the
more you get! From CDs, posters, unique <b>Rob Tardik </b>merchandise, private guitar
lessons, live in house concerts, <b>Rob Tardik </b>concert tickets, album credits all

</p><p><b>About So Roots</b></p>
<p>
</p><p></p><p>     “I want to capture a point in time and let people forever live in that same moment,”-Pono Patoc.</p>
<p>     SO ROOTS is now spreading their special moment in time with the world. Originally formed by a group of friends in high school from Honolulu, Hawaii, what started off as a monthly meeting about music they loved, soon turned into something much greater. Their music has let them travel to different places and meet new people everyday. Opening for bands such as Morgan Heritage, The Green, The Steppas, Maoli, The Hot Rain Band, The Jimmy Weeks Project, and many more. The young band is zealous to see what the future has in store for them.</p>
<p>     MALAMA(PONO)MAIKALANI ADRIAN PATOC, lead vocalist and keyboardist of So Roots, is finally paving his own way through the reggae scene. Performing as a keyboardist with many artists/bands including The Jimmy Weeks Project, Kiwini, Siaosi, Jah Maoli, Leilani Wolfgramm, and Iakopo to name a few, his drive and persistence has taken So Roots music far beyond what anyone has anticipated. KLANDON FETAUI and LAPANA IERIKO, the heartbeat of the band, is not only musically talented but extremely driven to accomplish their goals. Their presence has boosted So Roots progression tremendously.</p>
<p>     The success of So Roots thus far has been accomplished through hard work and perseverance. Independently releasing their music, “Still Love You” was their introduction to the world in 2013. They then released “Try”(featuring Rod Da Fire)  in early 2014. Both singles would later appear on their debut EP <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/so-roots-ep/id908486575"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>So Roots</i></a> that was released on September 18, 2014 with no expectations of hitting the charts. The six-track EP topped at number three on the iTunes reggae charts. Multiple songs from the EP received tremendous attention from several local radio stations.</p><p><br/></p><p>For more information visit us at <a href=""http://www.sorootsband.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sorootsband.com</a></p><p></p><p></p></div>","So Roots Fall Tour 2015

     “I want to capture a point in time and let people forever live in that same moment,”-Pono Patoc.
     SO ROOTS is now spreading their special moment in time with the world. Originally formed by a group of friends in high school from Honolulu, Hawaii, what started off as a monthly meeting about music they loved, soon turned into something much greater. Their music has let them travel to different places and meet new people everyday. Opening for bands such as Morgan Heritage, The Green, The Steppas, Maoli, The Hot Rain Band, The Jimmy Weeks Project, and many more. The young band is zealous to see what the future has in store for them.
     MALAMA(PONO)MAIKALANI ADRIAN PATOC, lead vocalist and keyboardist of So Roots, is finally paving his own way through the reggae scene. Performing as a keyboardist with many artists/bands including The Jimmy Weeks Project, Kiwini, Siaosi, Jah Maoli, Leilani Wolfgramm, and Iakopo to name a few, his drive and persistence has taken So Roots music far beyond what anyone has anticipated. KLANDON FETAUI and LAPANA IERIKO, the heartbeat of the band, is not only musically talented but extremely driven to accomplish their goals. Their presence has boosted So Roots progression tremendously.
     The success of So Roots thus far has been accomplished through hard work and perseverance. Independently releasing their music, “Still Love You” was their introduction to the world in 2013. They then released “Try”(featuring Rod Da Fire)  in early 2014. Both singles would later appear on their debut EP So Roots that was released on September 18, 2014 with no expectations of hitting the charts. The six-track EP topped at number three on the iTunes reggae charts. Multiple songs from the EP received tremendous attention from several local radio stations.For more information visit us at www.sorootsband.com",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I'm Jeremy Holtom and I head a small team who will manage our campaign that include my partner Michelle, also a talented artist and our two children Abi and Vicki aged fifteen and sixteen. I'm a music producer, mentor, business consultant, concert pianist, songwriter, lead vocalist and keyboard player and main writer for several bands signed to our record label Beyond Reality Music. I'm a poet, an artist, direct produce and edit some of our music videos one of which was featured on Classic FM TV for several years, a published author and an inspirational speaker. I also cook!!  I also own an anarchic record company, a publishing company, a mentoring company and a classic car company and the cars are loaned to those who choose to work with me as a mentor and guardian angel to follow their dreams. </span><br/>

I'm Jeremy Holtom and I head a small team who will manage our campaign that include my partner Michelle, also a talented artist and our two children Abi and Vicki aged fifteen and sixteen. I'm a music producer, mentor, business consultant, concert pianist, songwriter, lead vocalist and keyboard player and main writer for several bands signed to our record label Beyond Reality Music. I'm a poet, an artist, direct produce and edit some of our music videos one of which was featured on Classic FM TV for several years, a published author and an inspirational speaker. I also cook!!  I also own an anarchic record company, a publishing company, a mentoring company and a classic car company and the cars are loaned to those who choose to work with me as a mentor and guardian angel to follow their dreams. 


For twenty four years until the age of forty four I was one of the countries leading financial advisers until I sold up to pursue my own dreams, free my own heart and show others how to leave the mind numbing and life wasting illusion of corporate security and the illusion of safety. 

I deliberately chose to walk the riskiest path from 2002 in order to show others the way by leading from the front. Life is too short to play safe and be imprisoned by fear and the quest for a security that does not exist for we cannot fight fate and could be dead tomorrow!  


I have sunk every penny into my dreams, mortgaged everything up to the hilt. I have fended off bailiffs, fought off people who tried to make me bankrupt and gone to the very edges of losing my home which I have lived in for thirty years and bought at the age of 26 as a derelict shell.  Indeed you may have seen me in Channel Four's Posh Pawn in May 2014 when I played poker with my mortgage company raising £26,000 by pawning my prized Steinway concert grand piano which you can see in the video in classical and rock music mode to clear off my mortgage arrears two days before being evicted like in the film Field Of Dreams with Kevin Costner 



If you are going to achieve a dream there is only one right road and its risky, sometimes scary and very empowering and you have to be in the right places at the right time. What doesn't kill you really does make you much stronger. If you believe and never give up one day you will win when you have learned all you must to be the person you were meant to be.

Now after painting for ten years and releasing alot of ground breaking high energy music two things have come together. My first London art exhibition between 23rd September and 7th October this year at a gallery called Shamineh in Hampstead which has hosted some great exhibitions including one by Storm Thorgerson who painted several album covers for rock band Pink Floyd and the launch of our most powerful song Free Your Heart clips of which you can hear at the end of the video above.

You'll get a fuller picture of me from the video which is a little longer than usual. Its a short thirteen minute documentary introducing my paintings, videos, my classical and rock side, a bit about me and my family and two clips of Free Your Heart.
The artwork for Free Your Heart




The main facts are in the first four minutes or so but take the time to watch it all. Its a more interesting way to use thirteen minutes than watching most stuff on television and you'll understand me better!


 My aim is simple. To put the passion, inspiration and colour back into the world and sweep away many of the rules, regulations and the idea that things should be done a certain way. I want to inspire you all to break free and follow your hearts for all our dreams are possible! Help me to bring this about...

What I  am Looking For And the Amazing Things You Get For Supporting Me:


IF A THOUSAND PEOPLE EACH CHIP IN £20  MY TARGET WILL BE MET- EVERY LITTLE HELPS!


I am looking to raise a minimum of £20,000 by getting as many people involved as possible from people with very little to alot.  There are amazing perks at every level which will give you great music introducing you to the very different way we produce music (no Simon Cowell or manufactured music here). At £250 you'll get the chance to borrow my Mustang GT, come on a Creativity Day with me and receive a mentoring session to get you thinking about your own dreams and how to achieve them. You'll also pick up all the perks from lower levels of support. 


If you are a high roller who's prepared to back me for thousands well there are some great rewards for backing me for you too including the chance to receive some of my best paintings amongst your reward.


If 1,000 people each chip in £20 then the target will be met.

AN INSPIRATIONAL TALK GIVEN BY JEREMY TO A GROUP OF BUSINESS PEOPLE IN BLETCHLEY PARK IN NOVEMBER 2014 COMPLETE WITH MUSIC AND MESSAGES






There is a particularly attractive package at £20 to encourage people to push the boat out a little further that is worth upwards of £50. If you  are thinking about chipping in £5 or £10 well I'm encouraging you to take a small risk to push to £20 and rewarding you for taking it because when you start taking risks you have started walking to your dreams and started to free your own heart.



I want you to take the first step and the first slight risk on the journey to your own dreams. This provides two albums including our groundbreaking concept album about confronting fears and going for your dreams, Grim Reaper.....And Other Imaginary Fears which is sold in HMV, a classic single and a special signed and numbered limited edition pre- release copy of Free Your Heart with at least four tracks on it.


I promise you that you will pick up some luck by doing it and a proportion of those who push to £20 will get some  special ad hoc rewards from me that I won't tell you about now but for sure people that get them will tell the world!


I particularly want music lovers who have relatively little to buy real CD'S rather than downloads to benefit from this and be inspired by the music they receive!




The Grim Reaper video made at Eastnor Castle in Herefordshire in 2011 that has attracted more than 31,000 views on youtube. 

The video was directed by Peter Thomas who appeared in Vincent Price's most controversial film in the 1960's, Witchfinder General. Peter also plays the Priest in our video and does the menacing voiceover at the start of the video and song!


If we raise my target figure then the money will provide the following:

producing limited edition prints
Cost of printing invitations to private views and previews and

Hire of van to take pictures to and from  the exhibition

OILS





For Free Your Heart

Producing a video
Manufacture of CD'S
Hire of PR company and a plugger
Publicity photos
Fees for the performers
Paying the designer of the finished artwork
Producing posters. tee shirts and other publicity

Should I raise more than the target then I will use it to inject money into our record company, to fund the rest of the album on which Free Your Heart will appear, to fund a classical release called Reflections, hire staff to move forward and potentially get back my beautiful piano from the pawn brokers. I will also produce the next edition of my book about my journey called Messages From Beyond Reality and use some of the money to finance a classical piano tour.

If we raise less then the art exhibition is the first priority so we will have to delay the release of Free Your Heart.

THE PERKS

I really believe in sharing and helping to free everyone so the perks are all about that. You can support me from £5 upwards and you'll not only get music, tee shirts, copies of my book and DVD'S of an inspirational talk  and other goodies but potentially the opportunity to borrow fantastic cars, come on creativity weekends at my home, gain help from me to start journeying to your own dreams and even come and paint at my home or have me give  a private piano recital for you and your friends. You'll potentially get limited edition prints and original pieces of art for your home or office.  There really is something to inspire everyone whether you help with a little or alot!!

Help Me Change The World


We have all been boxed in by rules, too much education by regulations and how things should be done that we have lost sight of real creativity and originality. Without these things there is no chance of getting out of the financial mess the world has got into. I want to change this and free us all to be the people we want to be living as we want without busy bodies and politicians telling us how we should live! I want to help everyone to believe in themselves and what's possible.

I worked incredibly hard for twenty four years building a business in financial services that became one of the best in the country. I dealt with everyone from rock stars and famous actors to plumbers and people doing ordinary jobs. I learned how to manage and motivate people, how to sell and how to change people's thinking.

In 2002 after planning how I would do it for several years I sold my business for a substantial sum and walked away from security and safety and a large income to pursue my dreams. Within a year I had formed a record company. After eight years I had taken two clients of my mentoring company from wage slaves to membership of the Sunday Times Fastrack 100 Index which meant they ran two of the 100 fastest growing companies in the country. Both became multi millionaires.

I have become incredibly resourceful, a powerful negotiator and learned how to live right on the edge and use all my resources both personal and financial to greatest effect.

I have appeared in two prime time documentaries on National Television, on local and national radio and battles I have fought have been reported in national and local media. Google me and you will find out more.

I have been a supporter and spokesperson in the original petrol price campaign appearing on sky news. I have supported the metric martyrs financially who have been fighting for the retention of all things British. I have taken on the VAT authorities in the courts and fought test cases against speed cameras. By supporting me you will give me a bigger voice and a much higher profile to use the knowledge I have gained to really fight for a better, saner world for us all! 


Risks that I have taken and overcome



I have literally risked everything I have ever made as I knew I would have to to achieve  my dreams. It is one step at a time on the journey up the mountain. I have gained, wisdom, insight and an ability to think in a completely free and massively out of the box way. This I believe means that I will achieve my biggest goals and usher in a new age of freedom, individuality, creativity and new ways of thinking to take us all forward to a brave and more inspiring world!   
Even if you have very little you can still help!

To gain some really nice and unique perks starts with just five pounds. However even if you can't find this you can still help by spreading the word and using all the sharing tools available. Tell me if you have helped because I will remember and some of those who help in other ways than financial will find that I still give them a thank you in some way.
Even if you can't chip in this time there will be other opportunities down the road and I will enhance any perks if you have helped this time.

<p>A new album created in a different
direction by building the foundations for our future.</p>
<p>Shifting Tracks is an alternative
indie-pop/rock band from Mobile, AL. Over the past three years we’ve worked hard
to remain loyal to our fans and release an album every year filled with as much
music as we could afford to put on a record. Well now we are ready to carry on
this tradition and put out a fourth but instead of going that traditional route
we want to record this 15 song album in its entirety.</p>
<p>Recording, mixing, and mastering an
album can be very expensive and it only gets more costly with every song we put
on a record. Our projected expenses by those traditional means would be about
$10,000 which we found out is more than the cost to finish the studio we are
already building for ourselves. So we thought, instead of asking for help to
make one album let’s ask for help to build the foundations for all our future
albums to come! It will be like every album is a personally crafted musical
letter from us to you.</p>

</p>
<p>With no budget or income, I carried my guitar, a handy-cam,
my song (“If You Want”) and my vision with me, few years ago, starting off in
Lebanon, with the goal of singing my peace song in three cities. This vision was
only the beginning of what would become an ultimate journey that had me
traveling in over forty countries worldwide, delivering motivational speeches
at UN headquarters, universities, TV and radio stations, getting acknowledged
as a human rights, justice and peace activist, and getting the title of
“Ambassador for Peace” from UN-Affiliated Organizations.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">What's Next?</span><br/></p>
<p>Recently, I asked myself, “what’s next?” With a lot of hard
work, I managed to release two albums and few singles, including tracks in
English, Arabic, and Armenian, and I have worked extensively on my upcoming

<p></p></div>","Peter Jam: How it All Began... 

With no budget or income, I carried my guitar, a handy-cam,
my song (“If You Want”) and my vision with me, few years ago, starting off in
Lebanon, with the goal of singing my peace song in three cities. This vision was
only the beginning of what would become an ultimate journey that had me
traveling in over forty countries worldwide, delivering motivational speeches
at UN headquarters, universities, TV and radio stations, getting acknowledged
as a human rights, justice and peace activist, and getting the title of
“Ambassador for Peace” from UN-Affiliated Organizations.
What's Next?
Recently, I asked myself, “what’s next?” With a lot of hard
work, I managed to release two albums and few singles, including tracks in
English, Arabic, and Armenian, and I have worked extensively on my upcoming
book. I have accomplished my
EuropePeaceTour and am currently in the United States with the willpower to
keep on sharing my positive message through the power of music, art, and speech. Upon meditating on what’s coming up, I decided to launch this project which is

What is Needed:
The funding for the audio and visual production of ""We All Need"". The song will be recorded in the form of a marching band and choir.

Moreover, an important component of this project is the video/DVD that will document the journey and bring out the voices and images of the people joining together to make music. The budget includes travel expenses (tickets/accommodation). The peace-building tour will also include sessions for children and youth in music, peace education and non-violent communication.

<p>I've been asked, time and time again... ""When are you going to record a new album?"" I wish there was a simple answer to this, because I would have recorded one YESTERDAY. Being the perfectionist that I am, the thought of launching an album production haphazardly, just concerns me. It's gotta be good!</p>
<p>But plain and simple, a new recording project entails respectable costs... and being a recording artist with no major record label to provide finances during the creation process, even when making the most frugal efforts to make it happen, can be somewhat daunting. Very frustrating indeed!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495072838/edsghwwpudpndyk1blyu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>And... LIFE just seemed to get in the way, as it often does, and one year led into three... and so on. Other duties and responsibilities were priority... raising our daughter especially. But all along this goal continued to weigh heavier and heavier on my mind. Next thing I knew... nearly EIGHT years had passed.</p>
<p>However meanwhile, the past few years HAVE been pretty exciting! I've been blessed with the experiences of performing in New York City, Las Vegas, Hollywood, Los Angeles, Chinatown and several other cities. I have met and worked with some really amazing people. </p>
<p><strong>Below is a highlights video of several of these incredible memories and moments...</strong></p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/liZHY-QaGUc?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>I've had the privilege of enjoying other performance opportunities in the meantime... usually with an instrumental trio or using background tracks. Always fun. But all along that undying urge to step things up and record a new and better album continued to taunt and frustrate me! IT WAS TIME TO RECORD A FOLLOWUP ALBUM.</p>
<p>So now it´s 2017 and the voice in my head is screaming ""Time to make a move J-E-B! Time to suck it up and ask for help."" So, I am humbly reaching out to you today to seek your sponsorship with my next album project, which has been in the planning stages for the past 3 years, and a new corner to turn which I am most excited about!

</div></div>","I've been asked, time and time again... ""When are you going to record a new album?"" I wish there was a simple answer to this, because I would have recorded one YESTERDAY. Being the perfectionist that I am, the thought of launching an album production haphazardly, just concerns me. It's gotta be good!
But plain and simple, a new recording project entails respectable costs... and being a recording artist with no major record label to provide finances during the creation process, even when making the most frugal efforts to make it happen, can be somewhat daunting. Very frustrating indeed!

And... LIFE just seemed to get in the way, as it often does, and one year led into three... and so on. Other duties and responsibilities were priority... raising our daughter especially. But all along this goal continued to weigh heavier and heavier on my mind. Next thing I knew... nearly EIGHT years had passed.
However meanwhile, the past few years HAVE been pretty exciting! I've been blessed with the experiences of performing in New York City, Las Vegas, Hollywood, Los Angeles, Chinatown and several other cities. I have met and worked with some really amazing people. 
Below is a highlights video of several of these incredible memories and moments...

I've had the privilege of enjoying other performance opportunities in the meantime... usually with an instrumental trio or using background tracks. Always fun. But all along that undying urge to step things up and record a new and better album continued to taunt and frustrate me! IT WAS TIME TO RECORD A FOLLOWUP ALBUM.
So now it´s 2017 and the voice in my head is screaming ""Time to make a move J-E-B! Time to suck it up and ask for help."" So, I am humbly reaching out to you today to seek your sponsorship with my next album project, which has been in the planning stages for the past 3 years, and a new corner to turn which I am most excited about! In my own J-E-B style, this time around I pay homage to the great pop sounds of the late sixties (some amazing music). Not strictly big band and the Great American Songbook and such, but rather, the slightly more mainstream of classic 1960's radio pop hits.

<div><br/></div><div>
<b>Who am I?</b><br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div><div>Hello, my name is Peter Hudler, I am a classical educated cellist from Vienna/Austria. After my studies both in Vienna and Salzburg with some of the finest Austrian musicians I have been working the last years in various classical music formations, as a freelancer and fully employed, including Camerata Salzburg, the Irish Chamber Orchestra, the Danish Chamber Players and others. Here's a short clip for you: </div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div></div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FPNyiBFcnNso%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DPNyiBFcnNso&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FPNyiBFcnNso%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><div><br/></div>
<div>Recently I have discovered my wish to develop myself more and embrace new musical styles and concepts and my first adventure lead me into <i>the world of Jazz and Cross Over. </i>
</div>
<div>And here I am, with a<i> full evening Jazz and Cross-Over program for Cello Solo,</i> diverse and virtuosic, tender and powerful, depicting the great range of colors and characters  the cello offers, that urgently needs to be promoted and spread amongst the people! </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>What's the idea of the campaign?</b></div>
<div><br/></div><div>The idea is: To make <i>a  professional studio recording of this program</i> to help this project to grow. For getting concerts, gigs or tours, the most important thing is to be able to present a very good and professionally made recording. Plus: It is a great opportunity for myself to be able to work in a studio because in these situations every musician simply has to perform and work at their absolute best. </div>
<div>In any case it will warm my heart to give birth to this album and it will hopefully also warm yours, with the passionate and soothing qualities of the cello that come out so greatly with this kind of music!</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>I shall be very grateful for your donations! I have also made a list of exclusive and personal rewards for you and your generosity will be known to the people who buy this album! <br/>
</div>
<div>In case we don't reach the goal, I will at least make a shorter demo recording of 2 or 3 pieces, which would turn out to be much cheaper as the studio and postproduction time is payed by hour. <br/>
</div><div>In case we exceed the goal, there will be more time to record than planned and/or I can print more CDs. </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>Why do we need this recording?</b></div>
<div><br/></div><div>So why do we need this album?  I have chosen the music to this program very carefully and it's supposed to have a strong impact also regarded as a whole concept, from the first note to the last. Cello in Jazz has a long history, anyway many of the pieces I chose have never been recorded yet even though they definitely deserve it. </div><div>As a musician I am always searching to grasp a deep understanding of the music, to reach the essence of the piece, its character and I try to convey this to the audience. A good performance is for me when I feel free to play from my heart and touch my audience, to move the people and reach their hearts. It's a lot about communication and about some kind of urge to tell the audience what this music is, what it is about, and to experience it together.</div><div>With this program I hope I can connect the depth of the music, how I feel and know it as a classical musician with the power and vitality of Cross Over and Jazz, that I can communicate to you the rich and colorful variety of characters in this music with the understanding of a classical trained musician. </div><div><br/></div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458685632/xd1o7ga564w7bvz3vgb6.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 443.1297169811321px;height: 483px;""/></p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<b>What else is there to know? </b><br/>
</div><div><br/></div><div>One very special piece I have arranged myself and I would like to record it together with a friend of mine, Nikolaus Wagner, an Austrian pianist. This will be the only non-solo piece. Originally for Saxophone and Piano, <i>Erwin Schulhoff's jazzy ""Hot Sonata""</i> I arranged to be played on the cello and it works surprisingly well like this! So this is going to be a WORLD PREMIERE RECORDING of a piece by a composer whose worth and talent was underestimated for decades. </div><div>As an additional Bonus Track I have chosen another special piece. Looking for  ""archaic""music, I found the most archaic, oldest piece of music ever to be written down in the history of mankind. It was written on a stone in Latakia/Syria 1400 BC. Originally played on the Lyra, I will record this ""Hurrian Hymn"" to the goddess Nikkal, wife of the moon god, on the cello, for THE FIRST TIME as well, trying to invoke the spirit of the Lyra, of the goddess Nikkal and a very very ancient time. </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div><div>
<b>Let me sum it up.</b><br/>
</div><div><br/></div><div>I have been dreaming of doing this for quite some while now, and the only thing that has been in the way of realizing this project has been the financial pressure I am under as a freelancing musican, who has no fix income and has to find concerts and projects by himself every month. With this recording I can make a huge step of getting my music out to the people and become more established as a Cellist and musician in a new field and a new genre and bring this beautiful music out to the people.</div><div><br/></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>You don't have any money to spare?</b></div><div><br/></div><div>In case you cannot help financially (and I am the first one to understand this) you can also support this project by spreading the word and sharing this campaign with your network, friends, family and colleagues. Indiegogo provides all the tools for you to do that.</div><div><br/></div><div>Thank you very much and I hope you will enjoy the outcome of this project/campaign!</div><div><br/></div><div>Peter<br/>

Nachdem ich am Konservatorium Wien und am Mozarteum Salzburg studiert habe, war ich in den letzten Jahren in verschiedenen Ensembles und Orchestern tätig, freischaffend und auch angestellt, ua. bei der Camerata Salzburg, beim Irish Chamber Orchestra und bei den Danish Chamber Players.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Im letzten Jahr habe ich begonnen mich auch für andere Stile und Genres zu interessieren und meine erste Entdeckungsreise hat mich in die Welt der Jazz und des Cross Over geführt.</span></p>
<p>Also habe ich, mit sehr viel Freude, aber mir auch der Herausforderung bewusst,  ein abendfüllendes Programm zusammengestellt mit den verschiedensten Stücken für Cello, fast alle solo, die, wie ich hoffe, auf kontrastreiche Weise die vielfältigen Farben, Charaktere und Spielweisen darstellen, die man auf dem Cello mit dieser Musik darstellen kann. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Was ist die Idee der Kampagne?</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>Meine Idee ist: Ich möchte eine professionelle Studioaufnahme von diesem Programm machen, um diesem Projekt Auftrieb zu verleihen. Einerseits ist es wichtig, ausgezeichnete Tonmaterialien zu haben, um Engagements zu bekommen, andererseits finde ich das Programm selbst wertvoll und ganz sicherlich eine Bereicherung für Zuhörer und hoffentlich auch für Cellisten, die abseits vorgegebener Wege gehen wollen!</p>

</div></div>","Hier klicken für deutsche Version!Join Peter's quest to record a Jazz- and Crossover Cello-Album!

Who am I?

Hello, my name is Peter Hudler, I am a classical educated cellist from Vienna/Austria. After my studies both in Vienna and Salzburg with some of the finest Austrian musicians I have been working the last years in various classical music formations, as a freelancer and fully employed, including Camerata Salzburg, the Irish Chamber Orchestra, the Danish Chamber Players and others. Here's a short clip for you: 
Recently I have discovered my wish to develop myself more and embrace new musical styles and concepts and my first adventure lead me into the world of Jazz and Cross Over. 

And here I am, with a full evening Jazz and Cross-Over program for Cello Solo, diverse and virtuosic, tender and powerful, depicting the great range of colors and characters  the cello offers, that urgently needs to be promoted and spread amongst the people! 
What's the idea of the campaign?
The idea is: To make a  professional studio recording of this program to help this project to grow. For getting concerts, gigs or tours, the most important thing is to be able to present a very good and professionally made recording. Plus: It is a great opportunity for myself to be able to work in a studio because in these situations every musician simply has to perform and work at their absolute best. 
In any case it will warm my heart to give birth to this album and it will hopefully also warm yours, with the passionate and soothing qualities of the cello that come out so greatly with this kind of music!
What's going to be on the album?Here's the program - not yet in its final order - like I intend to record it on the album: 
Erwin Schulhoff: Hot SonataPhillip Glass: OrbitNikolai Kapustin: Introduktion und ScherzinoLucio Amanti: Jazz SuiteErik Friedlander: Night WhiteGiovanni Sollima: LamentatioMark o’Connor: Appalachian WaltzSvane Henryson: Black RunMark Summer: Julie-OMark Summer: Kalimba

Bonus Track: Hurrian Hymn #6
What will it cost?
And here is what it costs to produce this kind of recording: 
recording time/studio, 19 hours:                             1235  EURpost production, 19 hours:                                         1235  EURpiano tuning:                                                                        92 EURCD layout, booklet design                                            600 EURCD production (500 pieces)                                        590 EUR                              musicians                                                                           300 EURadministration costs                                                      300 EURTOTAL                                                                               4352 EUR

I shall be very grateful for your donations! I have also made a list of exclusive and personal rewards for you and your generosity will be known to the people who buy this album! 

In case we don't reach the goal, I will at least make a shorter demo recording of 2 or 3 pieces, which would turn out to be much cheaper as the studio and postproduction time is payed by hour. 
In case we exceed the goal, there will be more time to record than planned and/or I can print more CDs. 
Why do we need this recording?
So why do we need this album?  I have chosen the music to this program very carefully and it's supposed to have a strong impact also regarded as a whole concept, from the first note to the last. Cello in Jazz has a long history, anyway many of the pieces I chose have never been recorded yet even though they definitely deserve it. As a musician I am always searching to grasp a deep understanding of the music, to reach the essence of the piece, its character and I try to convey this to the audience. A good performance is for me when I feel free to play from my heart and touch my audience, to move the people and reach their hearts. It's a lot about communication and about some kind of urge to tell the audience what this music is, what it is about, and to experience it together.With this program I hope I can connect the depth of the music, how I feel and know it as a classical musician with the power and vitality of Cross Over and Jazz, that I can communicate to you the rich and colorful variety of characters in this music with the understanding of a classical trained musician. 



What else is there to know? 
One very special piece I have arranged myself and I would like to record it together with a friend of mine, Nikolaus Wagner, an Austrian pianist. This will be the only non-solo piece. Originally for Saxophone and Piano, Erwin Schulhoff's jazzy ""Hot Sonata"" I arranged to be played on the cello and it works surprisingly well like this! So this is going to be a WORLD PREMIERE RECORDING of a piece by a composer whose worth and talent was underestimated for decades. As an additional Bonus Track I have chosen another special piece. Looking for  ""archaic""music, I found the most archaic, oldest piece of music ever to be written down in the history of mankind. It was written on a stone in Latakia/Syria 1400 BC. Originally played on the Lyra, I will record this ""Hurrian Hymn"" to the goddess Nikkal, wife of the moon god, on the cello, for THE FIRST TIME as well, trying to invoke the spirit of the Lyra, of the goddess Nikkal and a very very ancient time. 

Let me sum it up.
I have been dreaming of doing this for quite some while now, and the only thing that has been in the way of realizing this project has been the financial pressure I am under as a freelancing musican, who has no fix income and has to find concerts and projects by himself every month. With this recording I can make a huge step of getting my music out to the people and become more established as a Cellist and musician in a new field and a new genre and bring this beautiful music out to the people.You don't have any money to spare?In case you cannot help financially (and I am the first one to understand this) you can also support this project by spreading the word and sharing this campaign with your network, friends, family and colleagues. Indiegogo provides all the tools for you to do that.Thank you very much and I hope you will enjoy the outcome of this project/campaign!Peter


 Deutsche Version

Unterstütze Peter's Studio-Aufnahme eines Jazz und Cross Over Cello Albums!


Hallo, mein Name ist Peter Hudler, ich bin ein klassisch ausgebildeter Cellist aus Wien/Österreich. Nachdem ich am Konservatorium Wien und am Mozarteum Salzburg studiert habe, war ich in den letzten Jahren in verschiedenen Ensembles und Orchestern tätig, freischaffend und auch angestellt, ua. bei der Camerata Salzburg, beim Irish Chamber Orchestra und bei den Danish Chamber Players. Hier ein kleiner Clip: 





Im letzten Jahr habe ich begonnen mich auch für andere Stile und Genres zu interessieren und meine erste Entdeckungsreise hat mich in die Welt der Jazz und des Cross Over geführt.
Also habe ich, mit sehr viel Freude, aber mir auch der Herausforderung bewusst,  ein abendfüllendes Programm zusammengestellt mit den verschiedensten Stücken für Cello, fast alle solo, die, wie ich hoffe, auf kontrastreiche Weise die vielfältigen Farben, Charaktere und Spielweisen darstellen, die man auf dem Cello mit dieser Musik darstellen kann. 

Was ist die Idee der Kampagne?

Meine Idee ist: Ich möchte eine professionelle Studioaufnahme von diesem Programm machen, um diesem Projekt Auftrieb zu verleihen. Einerseits ist es wichtig, ausgezeichnete Tonmaterialien zu haben, um Engagements zu bekommen, andererseits finde ich das Programm selbst wertvoll und ganz sicherlich eine Bereicherung für Zuhörer und hoffentlich auch für Cellisten, die abseits vorgegebener Wege gehen wollen!




Was wird auf der CD sein? 
Hier das Programm, wie ich es gerne aufnehmen möchte: 
Erwin Schulhoff: Hot SonataPhillip Glass: OrbitNikolai Kapustin: Introduktion und ScherzinoLucio Amanti: Jazz SuiteErik Friedlander: Night WhiteGiovanni Sollima: LamentatioMark o’Connor: Appalachian WaltzSvane Henryson: Black RunMark Summer: Julie-OMark Summer: KalimbaBonus Track: Hurrian Hymn #6

Was sind die Kosten? 

Und das ist der Kostenvoranschlag für das Projekt: 
Aufnahmezeit im Studio 19h:                             1235 EURNachbearbeitung 19h:                                           1235 EURKlavierstimmung:                                                        92 EURCD layout, booklet design                                      600 EURCD Produktion (500 Stück)                                   590 EUR                                        Musiker                                                                         300 EURAdministration                                                           300 EUR
SUMME                                                                       4352 EUR

Ich wäre sehr dankbar für einen Beitrag zu diesem Projekt! Ich habe natürlich exklusive und persönliche Geschenke („perks“) ausgewählt, und grössere Spenden werden im Booklet als Sponsor angeführt! 
Wenn wir das angestrebte Ziel nicht erreichen, werde ich einfach weniger Zeit im Studio verbringen und zumindest einige Nummern aufnehmen. Wenn mehr reinkommt, können wir auch mehr aufnehmen bzw. genauer. 

Warum so ein Programm aufnehmen? 

Ich habe lange an der Zusammenstellung dieses Programms gearbeitet und viel recherchiert und gesucht und ich hoffe dass es als Gesamtkonzept eine gute Wirkung hat und Sinn macht. 
Das Cello hat im Jazz eine lange Geschichte, trotzdem sind viele der Stücke, die ich ausgesucht habe, noch nie aufgenommen worden, oder selten, obwohl sie es verdienen. 
Das Interessante am Jazz und Cross Over ist für mich, dass ich einerseits mein Verständnis und meine Suche nach Tiefe und Struktur, wie ich es aus der klassischen Musik kenne, einbringen kann und andererseits die Möglichkeit habe, frei zu spielen, mich mit der mehr archaischen Kraft dieses Genres zu verbinden und das hat mir als Musiker sehr geholfen und neue Potentiale in mir zum Vorschein gebracht. Ich hoffe natürlich, dass auch die Zuhörer dieses Erfrischende und Belebende, das ich empfunden habe, spüren werden können!



Noch etwas?

Ein Stück ist etwas sehr besonderes, einerseits weil es das einzige ist, bei dem ich mit Klavier zusammen spielen werde, mit meinem Freund und Kollegen Klaus Wagne, andererseits weil ich es selbst arrangiert habe und es in dieser Form definitiv die allererste Aufnahme sein wird: Erwin Schulhoffs „Hot Sonata“ ist ursprünglich für Altsaxophon und Klavier geschrieben worden, ein jazziges Stück in klassischer Sonatenform, das auf dem Cello sehr gut klingt!
Als „Bonus Track“ möchte ich ein ganz spezielles Stück aufnehmen, und zwar das älteste jemals geschriebene Musikstück, aus dem Jahr 1400 vor Christus. Ursprünglich für Lyra geschrieben, habe ich diese aus dem heutigen Syrien stammende Stück für das Cello transponiert, um mit diesem „Hurrian Hymn“ die Mondgöttin Nikkal  heraufzubeschwören und den Geist der Lyra und einer lang vergangenen Zeit auf dem Cello zu erwecken.

Zusammenfassend… 

Ich habe mich lange darauf gefreut und mir gewünscht, dieses Projekt voranzubringen und bisher ist es nur am Geld gescheitert, da ich als freischaffender Musiker nicht immer die höchsten Gagen bekomme.
Mit dieser Aufnahme wäre mir sehr geholfen, da sie mir neue Türen öffnen würde in einem Genre und einer Szene, die mir bisher verschlossen war. 

Kein Geld? 

Wenn Sie kein Geld spenden können oder wollen, würde ich bitten, die Kampagne zu teilen, mit Familenmitgliedern, facebook-Freunden etc., damit möglichst viele Menschen davon hören. Indiegogo stellt dafür die nötigen Mittel zur Verfügung! Abgesehen davon hilft auch ein ganz kleiner Betrag (1 Euro) der Kampagne weiter, weil je mehr Leute involviert sind, desto präsenter wird die Kampagne auf dieser Seite!

We will be offering some super cool perks and prizes as incentives for your donations! We can't do this without all of you. You guys have been here to help us since day 1, and we already know your contributions are the only thing making this record possible for us. This is your music! Help us get it out there!We love you ALL!--Love Brooklyn",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Sleep Signals is an independent, nationally touring rock band from Minneapolis, MN. We are returning to the studio in April to record our third release and we need your help to make it happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise at least $10,000 USD for this album to cover the cost of recording, mixing, mastering, artwork, pressing, and distribution. We have already invested over $6,000 of our own money into the first single from the record (I'll Save You), that we released as a precursor for the album on 1/27/17. Your pledge helps us make this new album a reality!</p>
<p>We have a bunch of awesome limited-time perks in return for your contribution!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Without label support, we are fully responsible for all of the costs related to putting out a new record. With your help, we can release this new album, put out a new music video, and get back out onto the road to tour!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always risks and challenges to creating a new album. This is the third studio album we have written and we wrote over 40 candidates for this new record. We are deeply involved into the process of moving the record forward already and we have already recorded, mixed, and mastered one of the five tracks. Nothing will stop us from finishing this album!</p>

<p>**Please email me at karalockwood9@gmail.com with any questions as the email attached to this campaign is my old one. Thanks :) ** </p>
<h3>Who is Kara?</h3>
<p>I am a blossoming young folk rock indie artist who in many ways is just beginning to step into my potential. I wrote first my EP ""Free Child"" <a href=""https://karalockwood.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://karalockwood.bandcamp.com</a> and had it was recorded and produced by Jim Kwan at the Creativ Music Centre in North Vancouver. Now after several shows in the Vancouver area, 1 Cross Canada Tour and my debut EP under my belt, I am ready to take my music to the next level. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This campaign is for you and about you, my fans, supporters and future fans and supporters! With out you I could not make this happen! I have 6 songs written and ready to go, dates set in May at Blue Light Studio and the Lovely Bre McDaniel <a href=""http://www.bremcdaniel.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.bremcdaniel.com</a> will be doing my album artwork! </p>
<p> </p>
<p> With your help I will be able to fund this musical project that has been close to my heart for years. Together we will build a strong family and community around my music that will stretch from sea to shining sea. My heart is to connect with people through the music and that's really what it's about! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What I'm Asking For and What You Get in Return</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>So to bring this project to life I need your help! I am asking for $8000 + to make this happen. And I know asking is not always easy but most things worth doing in life aren't always quick and easy. So your contributions will go towards the following costs: </p>
<p><strong>Production and Studio Time</strong>: $6500</p>
<p><strong>Outside Musicians to come into the studio</strong>: $900</p>
<p><strong>Album Design and Artwork</strong>: $500</p>
<p><strong>Mastering</strong>: $450</p>
<p><strong>Printing of 300 CD's</strong> : $1000 </p>
<p>The project will come close to 10,000 to make, but I am leaving some room for me to fund it as well through my work, shows, busking and other misc ventures. Together we can make ""Creative Heart"" happen!</p>
<p>Of course I won't leave you hanging! In return for your generous donations you will get some amazing perks! Please see the right side bar for the list of what you can get. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe we were not put on this earth to go about life on our own. Creating art and music is a community effort. We weren't meant to hide ourselves and our art in our rooms and closets. So this is me putting myself out there and asking you to come on this journey with me. You will help me get my art out there to the people that need to hear it.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>It Won't All Be Easy but I'm Committed! </h3>
<p>Putting yourself out there, asking for help and being vulnerable are not at all easy!  However I know I can't pursue and live my musical calling without your help. My commitment to you and this campaign is to be all in. I will treat it as a 2nd job and will seek to frequently update as well as post pictures and videos. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Tight on Money But Still Want to Help? </h3>
<p>I recognize that everyone is at different levels financially in their lives. Not everyone can contribute financially to this project. If you can't then no problem! You can help me by spreading the word through social media (see the sharing buttons at the top right of the campaign), word of mouth, email and other platforms. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Thanks from the bottom of my 'creative heart' and I can't wait to go on this journey and share this album with you! </strong></p>

<p>Jenna Syde &amp; The Watchers need the help of our Watcher Army members to tour across the U.S. in the summer of 2017</p>
<p>We are Jenna Syde &amp; The Watchers, a 5 piece, female fronted, hard rock act from Hollywood, California</p>
<p>We have a new album we want to play for the public but touring funds are short when you are a small, independent band.</p>
<p>With your contribution we will be able to keep touring cost out of our own pockets which means we can: Pay for our van rental, sleeping arrangements, gas, food and still be able to pay our bills and feed our families when we come home.</p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>We are hoping to hit a total of $6000 by the end of our campaign. $2500 goes to van rental, $1000 to gas, $500 food, $1000 for motels, $1000 for emergency expenses, example.... van breakdown, medical issues, equipment breakdown or stolen gear.</p>
<p>Our perks range from personal video thank yous to signed musical gear and all are sent our with an extra piece of swag you can only get from this campaign.</p>
<p>if we don't meet our goal we will still use the funds we have raised to help us along the way but of course we will have to pull some cash out of our own pockets ( because when we set out to do something we freaking do it no matter what!)</p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>The impact of your contribution means we get to spread our music to a much wider audience and grow our bands fan base in places we wouldn't normally be able to reach.</p>
<p>In this day and age where people sit on their phones and computers all day we believe that live music, art, and performances are the last thing that truly bring us all together.</p>
<p>Our summer campaign two years ago nearly doubled our fan base and our music was able to reach people all across the west coast and south west from ages 5-85 years old.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you cant help.</p>
<p>even if you cant afford to contribute just getting the word out and making some noise about our campaign is a huge help!</p>
<p>You can share our indiegogo campaign through all social media platforms, text, email and even your own blogs.</p>

<p><strong>WHO AM I AND THE JOURNEY SO FAR</strong></p>
<p>I’m Yasmin Kadi - an independent singer song-writer chosen by <strong>BBC Introducing</strong> as ""some of London's best new music"" and whose debut EP went to <strong>No.1 on iTunes</strong> Ireland in 2014. My music style is a mix of Afrobeats &amp; Pop.</p>
<p>I've performed alongside the likes of <strong>Paloma Faith at the 02 Forum</strong>, headlined WOW Festival at the <strong>Royal Festival Hall</strong> Southbank London and played many festivals around the UK. I wrote and sang the top line melody for an episode in the American TV Series <strong>“Tyrant”</strong> staring <strong>Chris Noth</strong> aka <strong>Mr. Big</strong>. I've also performed live on several <strong>BBC Radio Shows,</strong> worked for the likes of <strong>BBC TV</strong>, <strong>Channel 4, Virgin Media, Universal Channel</strong> etc. and have had national radio play in Ireland, the UK and Sierra Leone in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>After my Debut EP charted at No.1 on iTunes Ireland, it lead me onto a UK tour with <strong>MOBO Award</strong> winning Hip Hop veteran <strong>Roots Manuva</strong>. While I was on tour, the makers of <strong>“Guitar Hero Live” </strong>(the video game) saw me and I landed the lead female role in the band <strong>“Vivid Screamz”</strong> in the game while I’m also in the boss level.</p>
<p>All of these experiences reassured me that I don’t have to change and become someone else in order to be successful, so now I am independently recording and releasing my debut album <strong>""No Drama"".</strong></p>
<p>The creation of this album is even more important now than ever because it promotes us as individuals and is about us <strong>embracing our true selves with all our ""flaws""</strong>. There is so much pressure in our society to look and be like all the girls and boys on TV. But <strong>no two people are alike, not even identical twins who are a division of the same egg.</strong></p>
<p>So help me stay true to myself and my artistry. To make great music without copying some other popular artist, without plugging things I don't believe in, without promoting the temporary, shallow, self-obsessed unrealistic picture perfect world we live in - which leads to anxiety about our true selves. <strong>Let’s get back to the music:</strong> lyrics you can sing to that actually mean something, melody that makes you want to dance and embracing our differences.</p>
<p>Stay true to yourself! You don't have to join the system! Create, Live, Love, Laugh and <strong>JUST B U</strong> :)</p>

I’m Yasmin Kadi - an independent singer song-writer chosen by BBC Introducing as ""some of London's best new music"" and whose debut EP went to No.1 on iTunes Ireland in 2014. My music style is a mix of Afrobeats & Pop.
I've performed alongside the likes of Paloma Faith at the 02 Forum, headlined WOW Festival at the Royal Festival Hall Southbank London and played many festivals around the UK. I wrote and sang the top line melody for an episode in the American TV Series “Tyrant” staring Chris Noth aka Mr. Big. I've also performed live on several BBC Radio Shows, worked for the likes of BBC TV, Channel 4, Virgin Media, Universal Channel etc. and have had national radio play in Ireland, the UK and Sierra Leone in the last 12 months.
After my Debut EP charted at No.1 on iTunes Ireland, it lead me onto a UK tour with MOBO Award winning Hip Hop veteran Roots Manuva. While I was on tour, the makers of “Guitar Hero Live” (the video game) saw me and I landed the lead female role in the band “Vivid Screamz” in the game while I’m also in the boss level.
All of these experiences reassured me that I don’t have to change and become someone else in order to be successful, so now I am independently recording and releasing my debut album ""No Drama"".
The creation of this album is even more important now than ever because it promotes us as individuals and is about us embracing our true selves with all our ""flaws"". There is so much pressure in our society to look and be like all the girls and boys on TV. But no two people are alike, not even identical twins who are a division of the same egg.
So help me stay true to myself and my artistry. To make great music without copying some other popular artist, without plugging things I don't believe in, without promoting the temporary, shallow, self-obsessed unrealistic picture perfect world we live in - which leads to anxiety about our true selves. Let’s get back to the music: lyrics you can sing to that actually mean something, melody that makes you want to dance and embracing our differences.
Stay true to yourself! You don't have to join the system! Create, Live, Love, Laugh and JUST B U :)
SOME OF THE SPECIAL PERKS

</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Do you love a good story?</b></span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Do you enjoy listening to great music?</b></span></p>
<p><b>Do you ever wish the book you were reading came with a
soundtrack, just like a movie?</b></p>
<p><b>Do you think reading skills and arts education are
important?</b></p>
<p>What if I told you there was a way to bring all of those
things together in a fun, engaging way?</p>
<p>Would you be interested, intrigued, want to know more?</p>
<p>Well, we’re creating a series of multimedia projects to
do just that.</p>
<p><b>The current project is an H.P. Lovecraft short story,
“The Music of Erich Zann”. </b>It’s a tale about a student’s encounter with an old
string player whose music opens a portal to another dimension. </p>
<p>Hi, I’m Mike, I’m a composer, and in case you’ve never
met one before, yes, we do exist. I say that because most people don’t really
know much about new, or for lack of a better name, 21<sup>st</sup>.century
classical music. And, if they’re aware of it at all, usually say they haven’t
heard it, and, wouldn’t like or understand it. The reality is that it is around
us all the time in the background of commercials, in movies, and on TV. </p>
<p>One of my goals with this series is to bring new music <b>out of the background</b>, making it the lead
character in telling stories. There are several reasons I’m passionate about doing
this:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">It draws new audiences to 21</span><sup style=""background-color: initial;"">st</sup><span style=""background-color: initial;"">
century music:</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">using
the story as a guide through the music eliminates the intimidation factor; kind
of like having GPS to guide you when you’re traveling somewhere new.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">It helps audiences understand how to listen to
new music, (something that, due to budget cuts in education, among other
things, is often not taught in schools anymore)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">It also works in the reverse, giving new readers
something to guide them through the text of the story, as well as adding an
additional layer of sensory experience for avid readers</span><br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>In today’s world we are used to consuming information in
a multimedia platform. As a result, fewer people are actually reading books.
Still, reading is an important skill, and projects like this encourage reading,
and enhance reader’s skill levels. </p>
<p>This project also provides an alternative to the
“horrible movie adaptation”. I know you’ve all been there: the book you love
gets turned into a film, you go to see it, and walk out of the theater
thinking, “Wow, that really sucked.” Well, with this format, you are actually
reading the story.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, although these projects may look like
movies on the surface, they are much more than that. The music can be performed
live and can stand alone as a concert work, and, the visual track is optional. The
music was written to follow the text of the story and allow time for the story
to unfold.</p>
<p>There are real advantages to this format. Someone could
easily replace the current visual track and:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">tell the story with dance, puppets, or anything
else, or</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">create a whole new visual track to accompany the
music, (really useful for those studying visual arts)</span><br/>

<p>“The Music of Erich Zann” is a story about a musician and
the power of music. What better way to tell this story than through music?!
And, did I mention it is an H. P. Lovecraft story? How cool is that?  Lovecraft has a huge fan base, and if you are

<p>So, whether you are an H. P. Lovecraft fan, you believe in

<p>Thank You!!!</p>
<br/><p></p></div>","Do you love a good story?Do you enjoy listening to great music?
Do you ever wish the book you were reading came with a
soundtrack, just like a movie?
Do you think reading skills and arts education are
important?
What if I told you there was a way to bring all of those
things together in a fun, engaging way?
Would you be interested, intrigued, want to know more?
Well, we’re creating a series of multimedia projects to
do just that.
The current project is an H.P. Lovecraft short story,
“The Music of Erich Zann”. It’s a tale about a student’s encounter with an old
string player whose music opens a portal to another dimension. 
Hi, I’m Mike, I’m a composer, and in case you’ve never
met one before, yes, we do exist. I say that because most people don’t really
know much about new, or for lack of a better name, 21st.century
classical music. And, if they’re aware of it at all, usually say they haven’t
heard it, and, wouldn’t like or understand it. The reality is that it is around
us all the time in the background of commercials, in movies, and on TV. 
One of my goals with this series is to bring new music out of the background, making it the lead
character in telling stories. There are several reasons I’m passionate about doing
this:

It draws new audiences to 21st
century music:


using
the story as a guide through the music eliminates the intimidation factor; kind
of like having GPS to guide you when you’re traveling somewhere new.


It helps audiences understand how to listen to
new music, (something that, due to budget cuts in education, among other
things, is often not taught in schools anymore)


It also works in the reverse, giving new readers
something to guide them through the text of the story, as well as adding an
additional layer of sensory experience for avid readers


In today’s world we are used to consuming information in
a multimedia platform. As a result, fewer people are actually reading books.
Still, reading is an important skill, and projects like this encourage reading,
and enhance reader’s skill levels. 
This project also provides an alternative to the
“horrible movie adaptation”. I know you’ve all been there: the book you love
gets turned into a film, you go to see it, and walk out of the theater
thinking, “Wow, that really sucked.” Well, with this format, you are actually
reading the story.
Make no mistake, although these projects may look like
movies on the surface, they are much more than that. The music can be performed
live and can stand alone as a concert work, and, the visual track is optional. The
music was written to follow the text of the story and allow time for the story
to unfold.
There are real advantages to this format. Someone could
easily replace the current visual track and:


tell the story with dance, puppets, or anything
else, or


create a whole new visual track to accompany the
music, (really useful for those studying visual arts)


The possibilities are endless. 
This has been a dream of mine to do something like this since
college. Back then the technology wasn’t available, and the tools
that were available were prohibitively expensive. Now technology has advanced,
and our vision can become a reality. The world has caught up with our dreams, and
it is time to bring them to life.

<h3>An Album Thirty Years In The Making....</h3>
<div>A true story you won't believe.</div> <p></p>
<p>Thirty years ago, when Rise And Run began its journey in and out and back into my life, we had a handful of bands that we really looked up to. Two of these bands were The Waterboys and Hothouse Flowers, two amazingly fiery and passionate bands that were the best of everything I liked in music. The Waterboys were UK based (soon to relocate to Ireland) and Hothouse Flowers were from Ireland.</p>
<p>Along the way, amazingly, I became friends with Mike Scott and then Steve Wickham from The Waterboys— Steve and I have even written and recorded together a few times over the past fifteen years or so. I never approached Liam o Maonlai of Hothouse Flowers until just a couple of weeks ago, and I was overjoyed that he responded to me.</p>
<p>When I told him about the project I was working on, he expressed interest but said he didn't have any recording equipment at hand. We continued to talk, and a day or so later, I got a cryptic message from Liam: do you know anybody in NY? I thought about it and answered, ""I've never been to New York.

<p>Well, soon I got a message back from Liam: <br/>""I'm going to be in Bedford next Monday and Tuesday.""</p>
<p>I thought, surely someone is playing around with me, this can't be true. <br/>Then from Liam: ""Do you know Tom O'Brien?""</p>
<p>Well, aside from the name sounding a bit like Tim Bryant, I'd never heard it before. I don't know anyone but Mitch in New York. So I get to Mitch, catch him up on this preposterous tale, and ask him, ""Do you know someone named Tom O'Brien?""</p>
<p>And Mitch answers,""The architect?""</p>
<p>And I say, ""Heck if I know, I don't know him!""</p>
<p>So I go back to Liam and I say, ""The architect?""</p>
<p>And Liam answers back, ""Yes! The same!""</p>
<p>So it transpires that Liam flew into New York on Monday to spend a couple of days in little Bedford (about half the size of Nacogdoches) with his architect friend Tom O'Brien, whom my friend Mitch knows.... and Tom and Mitch are both friends with a guy named John Lissauer who owns a really cool studio built inside an old barn, just minutes away from Tom's house.</p>
<p>And John Lissauer is a really nice guy (who recorded a bunch of Leonard Cohen's best albums, as well as Loudon Wainwright, Bette Midler and many others) who just so happened to have nothing scheduled for Tuesday morning, the time that Liam asked for, so Mitch picked Liam up and took him to the studio to play tin whistle and bodhran on the song Black Pig and sing along on one called Salvation.</p>
<p>The interesting part about that is, I wrote Salvation twenty years ago with Hothouse Flowers in my mind as I did. Truthfully. (Not too difficult to believe, really, as it does sound a bit like them.)</p>
<p>So today, I heard Liam o Maonlai of Hothouse Flowers sing along on my song. It's going to be a duet, Liam and me. I heard him play his whistle and bodhran and some other tuned percussion instrument on my (other) song, a song on which Steve Wickham already plays a blazing fiddle. Steve, Liam, and me. Unbelievable.</p>
<p>Liam, Mitch and John evidently had a great time in the studio this morning. And I was there in spirit, getting a continual feed of photos and snippets of sounds from Mitch as it all went down. John had all my notes on the songs, and he did an outstanding job of creating the perfect space for things to happen.</p>
<p>Thirty years after Rise And Run's first album, twenty years after the golden days when we wrote the songs that were recorded today, Rise And Run is back with Steve Wickham and Liam o Maonlai along for the ride. And it's not just them.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago, my childhood best friend Brad Busby, his brother Todd Busby, my future ex-wife Melanie Barnett and I went into a recording studio and made our very first album.

An Album Thirty Years In The Making....
A true story you won't believe. 
Thirty years ago, when Rise And Run began its journey in and out and back into my life, we had a handful of bands that we really looked up to. Two of these bands were The Waterboys and Hothouse Flowers, two amazingly fiery and passionate bands that were the best of everything I liked in music. The Waterboys were UK based (soon to relocate to Ireland) and Hothouse Flowers were from Ireland.
Along the way, amazingly, I became friends with Mike Scott and then Steve Wickham from The Waterboys— Steve and I have even written and recorded together a few times over the past fifteen years or so. I never approached Liam o Maonlai of Hothouse Flowers until just a couple of weeks ago, and I was overjoyed that he responded to me.
When I told him about the project I was working on, he expressed interest but said he didn't have any recording equipment at hand. We continued to talk, and a day or so later, I got a cryptic message from Liam: do you know anybody in NY? I thought about it and answered, ""I've never been to New York. I have one good friend up there— Mitch Horn— but he's about an hour outside the city, in a little town called Bedford.""
Well, soon I got a message back from Liam: ""I'm going to be in Bedford next Monday and Tuesday.""
I thought, surely someone is playing around with me, this can't be true. Then from Liam: ""Do you know Tom O'Brien?""
Well, aside from the name sounding a bit like Tim Bryant, I'd never heard it before. I don't know anyone but Mitch in New York. So I get to Mitch, catch him up on this preposterous tale, and ask him, ""Do you know someone named Tom O'Brien?""
And Mitch answers,""The architect?""
And I say, ""Heck if I know, I don't know him!""
So I go back to Liam and I say, ""The architect?""
And Liam answers back, ""Yes! The same!""
So it transpires that Liam flew into New York on Monday to spend a couple of days in little Bedford (about half the size of Nacogdoches) with his architect friend Tom O'Brien, whom my friend Mitch knows.... and Tom and Mitch are both friends with a guy named John Lissauer who owns a really cool studio built inside an old barn, just minutes away from Tom's house.
And John Lissauer is a really nice guy (who recorded a bunch of Leonard Cohen's best albums, as well as Loudon Wainwright, Bette Midler and many others) who just so happened to have nothing scheduled for Tuesday morning, the time that Liam asked for, so Mitch picked Liam up and took him to the studio to play tin whistle and bodhran on the song Black Pig and sing along on one called Salvation.
The interesting part about that is, I wrote Salvation twenty years ago with Hothouse Flowers in my mind as I did. Truthfully. (Not too difficult to believe, really, as it does sound a bit like them.)
So today, I heard Liam o Maonlai of Hothouse Flowers sing along on my song. It's going to be a duet, Liam and me. I heard him play his whistle and bodhran and some other tuned percussion instrument on my (other) song, a song on which Steve Wickham already plays a blazing fiddle. Steve, Liam, and me. Unbelievable.
Liam, Mitch and John evidently had a great time in the studio this morning. And I was there in spirit, getting a continual feed of photos and snippets of sounds from Mitch as it all went down. John had all my notes on the songs, and he did an outstanding job of creating the perfect space for things to happen.
Thirty years after Rise And Run's first album, twenty years after the golden days when we wrote the songs that were recorded today, Rise And Run is back with Steve Wickham and Liam o Maonlai along for the ride. And it's not just them.
As Liam said, it's just mad, all the connections. We all sensed it. This was meant to be. Maybe today was meant to be for twenty years, I don't know. To paraphrase the late, great Curtis Mayfield, Serendipity is strong in here.
Rise and Run. Rock and Roll.

<div>My name is Jonny and I have been a small town musician in Quinte,Ontario for the past ten plus years. I am currently working on a new album set to release the summer of 2016. This project means so much to me not only because I am finally pulling back the curtains and giving people honest, raw music but I also get to make a difference in the lives of many others fighting something I've personally battled with my last 24 years. My mother was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis at 16, she's been paralyzed, blind, weak and strong but she's always remained a phenomenal mother. She is my biggest fan and this album is for her, and those like her who suffer day in and day out without any answers. I asked myself while creating this album how I could make an impact beyond just the music and this is why I stand in front of you today. </div> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; what you get</h3>
<div>- I am looking to fundraise a total of $10,000 to totally fund the album. This amount will take care of the production of the album itself, three studio musicians, the physical copies of the album printed, wrapped and signed. The music videos and promotional photo shoots to bring you the best product possible. I am offering a wide range of packages in exchange for your donations. Everything from signed copies of the album, to live cover songs of your request and EVEN booking me to perform at the  private event of your choice. In planning this fundraiser I decided that a total of 20% of ALL fundraising generated through this campaign will be donated directly to the Multiple Sclerosis society of Canada. From what I've explained you can understand that this album is going to cost a great amount and I am just one guy. If the campaign does not reach it's goal I may need to push the release date of the album back, but I believe that we can do this, together. Believe in my dream, pre-order your copy or package and let's Fight M.S together. </div>
<div>With this campaign everyone wins, you get a guaranteed copy of a new country artist. I get the funding to bring you the best possible product and together we get to impact the lives of millions by furthering research. I am a small town boy with a population under 50,000. You've allowed me to travel the province playing my music, you've watched my videos over a quarter million times, you voted for me in nation-wide contests and made me a winner. Let me give something back to you, something you can carry with you on your next journey. Let's make this album fly!</div>

Finite Automata got it's start in Pensacola Florida as a one man side project by Mod Eschar (Dom Price). Over the years they've fought tooth and nail to bring their twisted and hard hitting flavor of old-meets-new electro-industrial to the fold of industrial music scene.The early showsHaving done small mini-tours over the years and having been plagued with line-up changes and setbacks, it was not until the release of Recurse and subsequent move to Atlanta, Georgia where we began to gain traction. Today Finite Automata consists of vocalist/songwriter/producer Mod Eschar, keyboardist Scott Storey (formerly of Skabdriver and Voodoo Velkro), and guitarist Damian Turner of Atlanta based EctoProxy. A taste of things to come. We are hard at work on our next release! And will be playing material from ""Dogma Eye"" on tour!Now is the moment we've been waiting for. The next phase of a journey we started almost 10 years ago. Our first multi-week national tour, as special guests for God Module! We'll be hitting 12 cities (with more being added as we speak) throughout the South, the East, and the Midwest. We live for the stage. It's where Finite Automata truly belongs. We are performance artists first, and this is what we want to help bring back to live industrial. A sensory onslaught that harkens back to the early days when industrial music was more than just an art form.... it was a statement. The Breakdown:We will of course be able to recoup some of the costs on tour with some merch sales, however Mod, Damian, and Scott will be putting in over $3000 of their own personal money to make this happen. There is no label backing us financially, no external revenue. Just us, and whatever we can scrounge together ourselves to make this happen, to finally bring our statement to you in person.... and we are going to do it regardless of whether or not we get fully funded.... because we are driven to do it, and we must. However before we embark on our long journey, we want to give you a chance to be part of the next chapter.Here's the breakdown of the costs:$1400 for direct tour costs which have to be paid upfront.$1000 for merch pressings to help us eat and get lodging on the road.$600 for fuel and toll costsHere's our Itinerary so far:5.27 Orlando FL - Bombshell's Tavern5.31 Atlanta, GA - Club Famous6.01 Richmond, VA - Fall Out6.02 Washington, D.C. - Tropicalia6.03 Wilmington, DE - Bar XIII6.04 New York City, NY - Smack!

 I’ve always thought of jazz as being the language of imagination and 
freedom— a conversational, fluid melding of ideas. This piece features a
 jazz trio (tenor saxophone, trombone, and double bass), set against the
 backdrop of an orchestra. The first movement of Blueprint opens with 
some precise, dancing Balkan rhythms, which set the tone and reveal the 
architecture of the work. The second movement begins as a slow 
meditation (taking its inspiration from the evocative quote by poet 
Kahlil Gibran, above), and builds toward a climax—“melting into the 
sun”—the idea of the release of the spirit from the body. The third 
movement mirrors the first movement in its exuberant rhythmic drive, and
 also draws a bit of inspiration for its raw melodic language from the 
delta blues. This was an incredibly fun piece to write, and I’d like to 
acknowledge with thanks the trio of musicians involved in the premiere: 
Brent Mah (tenor saxophone), Jim Hopson (trombone), and Graham Clark 
(double bass).<br/>_______<br/><br/>We really appreciate your donation to support bringing this exciting piece to life!  Even if you can't afford a monetary donation to the project, we'd love it if you could help spread the word!  Hope to see you at the premiere, too!<br/><br/>Musically yours,<br/><br/>Elizabeth, Brent, Jim, and Graham<br/>

sun”—the idea of the release of the spirit from the body. The third 
movement mirrors the first movement in its exuberant rhythmic drive, and
 also draws a bit of inspiration for its raw melodic language from the 
delta blues. This was an incredibly fun piece to write, and I’d like to 
acknowledge with thanks the trio of musicians involved in the premiere: 
Brent Mah (tenor saxophone), Jim Hopson (trombone), and Graham Clark 
(double bass)._______We really appreciate your donation to support bringing this exciting piece to life!  Even if you can't afford a monetary donation to the project, we'd love it if you could help spread the word!  Hope to see you at the premiere, too!Musically yours,Elizabeth, Brent, Jim, and Graham",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Benny Wise is from the UK, he's lived in Vancouver booking and producing local shows now for five years and has made more friends than some people make in a lifetime. The 2015 Revival Festival lineup was 100% curated by him - and everyone involved volunteered their time and efforts simply because they love and believe in Benny. The event was an enormous success, but not without financial loss which Benny took the brunt of.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, I'm Stephen Cox. I've been playing bass and writing music for over 15 years. For most of that time, I have dreamed of having my own album. ""Transitions,"" will not only be a work of art to share with friends and family, it is also a key to countless opportunities! It will allow me to get radio play, T.V. placement, shows out of state and possibly even the country, and it will let other artists know why they should hire me for their projects and shows. By contributing to this, you are propelling my career forward, as well as helping to support the other musicians, photographer(s) and sound engineers involved in this project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to achieve this goal, I need to pay a lot of people: The musicians, the audio engineer, the mastering engineer, the manufacturers of the CDs, the graphic arts designer, the online music distributors, the photographer of the cover art (Drew Stawin)...It ends up being a lot of money! $5,000 is an estimate of all of these costs, but it may cost more depending on unforeseen obstacles.</p>
<p>If you help me achieve this goal, there are many cool rewards you will receive including your name on the album Acknowledgements, a copy of the cd, and even a private house concert!</p>
<p>If the entire goal is not met, I will still finish the album! I am willing to do whatever it takes to complete this project! </p>

</div><p>I am <strong>Jaynee Thorne</strong>. I’ve lived in the Los Angeles area since 1962, an import from Roslyn, New York. The Beatles opened my ears to music in 1964. My maternal grandfather was a popular songwriter of the late 1920’s. My paternal grandmother was an opera singer.<strong> Music was in my blood</strong>. For most  of my musical endeavors, I have enjoyed being a harmony singer. I love feeling the resonance of other singers' voices in my chest. This album will force me to take center stage, a place not really in my comfort zone.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THIS ALBUM IS DEDICATED TO MY PARENTS AND MY GRANDPARENTS WHO GAVE ME THE GIFT OF MUSIC! ... And to the community of musicians and friends who now have BECOME my family.</strong></p><p>Music became very important to me in my pre-teen years, when the dysfunction of family life and changes in life became difficult for me to cope with. I began writing when my best friend died from leukemia, and I performed a song I wrote for her at our Junior High School graduation.  I witnessed the power of music as the attendees of the graduation cried during my performance. I knew then, the significance of music, and the healing power of writing <strong>positive</strong> songs.</p><p>We are all a product of DNA and environment. We are also a product of our parents' beliefs and fears, along with the exact way we are all hard-wired. Bottom line, my desire to follow my heart in music lost out to putting a roof over my head. A practical decision. One that I am not ashamed of making. However, as I am getting older, I see that <strong>I need to put my music in physical form…</strong> and <strong>MAKE AN ALBUM</strong>.  Up to this point in my life, I have succeeded in some things, but taking the time, money and courage to record my music has not come to fruition for over forty-something years. Thus, the title of this project… <strong>“The Forty-Something First Album.”</strong> I see that I have not been able to do this alone. I need the support of those who care for me to keep me focused; to help me follow through on this most important journey – <strong>making an album</strong>.

However, as I am getting older, I see that I need to put my music in physical form… and MAKE AN ALBUM.  Up to this point in my life, I have succeeded in some things, but taking the time, money and courage to record my music has not come to fruition for over forty-something years. Thus, the title of this project… “The Forty-Something First Album.” I see that I have not been able to do this alone. I need the support of those who care for me to keep me focused; to help me follow through on this most important journey – making an album. Music IS important - for its own artistic sake... even if it doesn’t pay the mortgage.   Where does your contribution go?Everyone needs to know this and it's important that you understand the details in what it takes to make an album. Until I started to go in the studio, and started the process of recording the album, I didn’t even know how much goes into this process. The album itself will take many dozens of hours of studio time alone. After the album is recorded, the mixing process begins, then mastering makes the recordings ready for the CD manufacturing.Your contributions will cover all of these aspects of this project:
Producing the album
Mixing and Mastering the album
The Musicians in the studio
The Musicians promoting the album
Pressing and packaging of CD's 
Paying for the cover art
Shipping the album to YOU
Shipping the album to radio stations
Shipping the album along with other materials to festivals
Promoting the album
Paying the Indiegogo fee

 

 


  The Impact:Music is a powerful healer. I hope that those who listen to my music feel moved and inspired by the lyrics and dance to the melodies! I hope my vulnerability and honesty will help others see that they are not alone in their experiences.Risks & Challenges:The risk that a songwriter takes is feeling vulnerable when they write a song that reveals a lot about themselves. But that is what writing music is about! My songs are cathartic. I've had to let go of feeling fearful and let myself and others see all aspects of my heart. That is what music is: what feelings would sound like. The only risk in this project, is not doing it… not being willing to allow creativity to come through. This album will get finished. I see this project becoming fully funded and blessed by all who join in its manifestation. Those who need to hear this music ...will… just as the Universe works.Other Ways You Can Help:I understand money can be tight. Whether or not contributing to the campaign is feasible, there are other ways you can be a valuable part of the “Forty-Something First Album” project. HELP SPREAD THE WORD about this campaign by sharing the link, telling your friends, and thereby ultimately assisting us in reaching our goal! Thank you for your love!I so look forward to making this magical journey with you! Thank you for being a part of this moment in my life.   ….Jaynee Leslie Beauvais and Jaynee singing with the Severin Browne band. Penny Nichols, Jaynee Thorne, Severin Browne and Janice Smith at Summersongs West. A song collage of my grandfather, Billy Stone.",10.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jordi Baizan.  I am a singer-songwriter, writer, and public speaker.  I have had an amazing journey in the last 10 years since I got back into music after a long hiatus. It started with playing covers for friends and family and has grown to three records released in the last 6 years with my band, QandA.  We are playing all over Texas to growing audiences and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>But now I have the opportunity to take things to a whole new level.  Our four great kids are grown and off pursuing their own dreams.  My wife Carmen and I are experiencing the freedom of the empty nest! This new flexibility gives me the opportunity to travel as a solo artist in a way that I cannot travel with a full band.  My vision is to travel the United States and beyond to help and inspire people to be their best selves by sharing myself through my music, writing and public speaking.  It is a childhood dream come true!</p>
<p>My mission is to do more, much more, but I cannot do it without you. With you as my partner and with a great deal of hard work and investment on my part,  I will release my first solo record in early 2017 and go from doing 6 live events in 2016 as Jordi Baizan to 60 live events in 2017.  Live events are solo shows or speaking engagements.   I will also produce and release new videos, songs, blog posts and speaking presentations that will inspire and serve those that are gracious enough to listen and engage.</p>
<p>I am humbled by the wonderful feedback and support that you guys have always given me in the past.  Together, we can continue to produce great music and content, reach out to people across the globe, and inspire them with the best that I can give.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For this campaign, we need a total of $10,000.  These funds will help me to release my first solo record, provide marketing support, and engage potential fans with a new website and quality video.  Not only will you make a tremendous impact on the success of our mission, but you will enjoy some really cool rewards and experiences that include advance copies of the new record, unique merchandise, private concerts in your own home, behind the scenes access, and, if we achieve the campaign goal, a live video stream concert for everyone who partners with me on this project!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By joining Team Jordi, you will make a massive difference.  Here is more detail on how the resources from this campaign will be used to create and connect more than ever before.</p>
<p>There are basically three things that we need in order to accomplish our 2017 goals:</p>
<p>1) Smart Marketing to expose our work to those who might be interested.  I will travel to Industry conferences like the Southwest Regional Folk Alliance, International Folk Alliance, and Far West Folk Alliance to perform for and network with venue owners, booking agents, industry professionals, and fellow artists.  We will do some targeted Facebook advertising for live events and/or to get people to our website.  We will do some radio promotion to get our music to new fans.  Finally, I  will enter songwriting competitions and festivals to increase exposure and recognition of the work.</p>
<p>2)  Website and Video to involve those who want to know more using the power of multimedia to create connection.  We will build a new website and create videos to involve those that want to know more and give them the opportunity to sign up for the email list, attend or book a live event, or buy the new record.</p>
<p>3)  Quality Content to bring value to the community and create the resources to grow the mission.  We will release my first solo record, Like the First Time.  These songs are inspired by loving relationships,  the triumph of the human spirit in the face of tragedy, the beauty of nature, how our decisions give us the power to shape our destiny,  and the importance of family and where I grew up.  To listen to the title track and read about what moved me to write it, <a href=""http://jordibaizan.com/index.php/2016/09/20/is-this-the-last-time/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CLICK HERE</a>. I am honored that this project was recorded and produced in Nashville by the brilliant Ren Renfree.  The songs are taken to a whole other level by a short list of amazing players including Lloyd Maines, (Dobro and Slide Guitar), Chris Gage (Accordion), John Pointer (Cello), Peter ""Ren"" Renfree (Guitar, Mandolin, Bass and Percussion) and Steve Thomas (Fiddle).  We had so much fun and I believe you will enjoy the record as much as we got a kick out of making it! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is a great deal of work ahead, and many challenges that we do not foresee.  I might find that there are areas in which I need to improve as an artist, writer, or speaker to reach my full potential.   Some of our efforts might not have the impact we expected or desired.  </p>
<p>To combat these challenges, I have committed to spending my time primarily on the creative side of the mission, on improving my craft.  I have also brought on a very experienced team to manage the business side of the mission.  They are Ren and Andi Renfree of Aren Creative and Charlie Stewart of Handshake Management.  Their experience in all areas of the music industry will help me to avoid common pitfalls and make good strategic and tactical decisions every step of the way.  They will also handle the details that bog down so many artists such as booking, promotion, website management, networking, and so much more.  They are as passionate as I am about the vision and mission.   We hope you will bring your own passion to the campaign and partner with us today!</p>

<h2><u><i><strong>The Project</strong></i></u></h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Joshuah Noah Snel, I'm an aspiring artist trying to fulfill my goal of creating and releasing my first ever studio album! I was born and raised in Redding, a small town in northern California, and since birth have always desired to add my artistic innovative mark to the world. I recently moved to Southern California in order to further pursue my passions and gain a successful career. I'm here on Indiegogo to promote and gather support for just that! With your help, I can finally be able to share my music and passion on a significantly larger scale. Having a complete album is not only a magnificent accomplishment for myself and my supporters but, also gives a stronger value towards my career when finding venues to perform at for the future touring I intend to do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong><u><i>How You Can Help!</i></u></strong></h3>
<p>The goal is to raise $1,600 for the creation of the album. All the money raised will go directly into paying for the the total cost of the process and make of the album. If the $1,600 goal is exceeded, the rest of the money will go towards making  professional music videos for the album or a community help foundation of my choosing. The sooner the goal is met, the faster I can bring you a fresh palate of music for you to listen to! A shared win win project that helps  make my dream become a reality and provides you with an engaging heart felt body of music. Let's do this!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We're a four piece stoner rock band based in Trondheim, Norway. On 1st September 2015 we released ""Down With the Sun"", our first full length album, on Nasoni Records. It was all good fun, but we want to make an even better album this time. We have already signed a deal with All Good Clean Records, and are set for release of a 7"" single this spring and the full album in autumn.</p>
<p>The deal is a split kind of deal, so we pay some of the pressings and all of the mixing and mastering, plus artwork. Now, that's a decent amount of money we currently don't have, as everything was spent on the recordings.</p>
<p>What we found when releasing the first album was an incredible supportive audience ranging from countries like Russia in east to Brazil in west and many in between. Asking anyone for money isn't something you really wanna do, but maybe it can be a bit of a win-win as we think this album is a much stronger and more complete album than the last one. </p>
<p>So what if no one contributes here? Well, we have to have a plan for that, and that's pretty much applying for every penny (or krone) we can in different funds and organisations. Most likely, that won't be enough anyways. So the album will have to be put off for a while, and the whole process basically put on pause until we all have regular incomes or something like that.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What am I paying for?</h3>
<p>Okay, let's break it down to the details of this puzzle:</p>
<p>The recordings set us back about £2500, and that's what we had from gigs + selling albums and merch.</p>
<p>Coming up we have three main outcome posts to overcome:</p>
<ul style=""margin-left:80px;"">
<li>Pressing: £750 (our share of a given total amount, split with record company)</li>
<li>Mixing: £1800</li>
<li>Mastering: £900</li>
<li>Artwork: £500</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>Total: £3950</u></strong></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
We're a four piece stoner rock band based in Trondheim, Norway. On 1st September 2015 we released ""Down With the Sun"", our first full length album, on Nasoni Records. It was all good fun, but we want to make an even better album this time. We have already signed a deal with All Good Clean Records, and are set for release of a 7"" single this spring and the full album in autumn.
The deal is a split kind of deal, so we pay some of the pressings and all of the mixing and mastering, plus artwork. Now, that's a decent amount of money we currently don't have, as everything was spent on the recordings.
What we found when releasing the first album was an incredible supportive audience ranging from countries like Russia in east to Brazil in west and many in between. Asking anyone for money isn't something you really wanna do, but maybe it can be a bit of a win-win as we think this album is a much stronger and more complete album than the last one. 
So what if no one contributes here? Well, we have to have a plan for that, and that's pretty much applying for every penny (or krone) we can in different funds and organisations. Most likely, that won't be enough anyways. So the album will have to be put off for a while, and the whole process basically put on pause until we all have regular incomes or something like that.

What am I paying for?
Okay, let's break it down to the details of this puzzle:
The recordings set us back about £2500, and that's what we had from gigs + selling albums and merch.
Coming up we have three main outcome posts to overcome:

Pressing: £750 (our share of a given total amount, split with record company)
Mixing: £1800
Mastering: £900
Artwork: £500

Total: £3950
We haven't included the merch here, that's gonna have to come later. The sums are approximate, but pretty realistic with the amounts coming from the people involved in these processes.
Okay. We're nothing without our fans/listeners. We so desperately want to give you this, and would have gladly given it all to you for free! But turns out the music business wants its money beforehand and do not give a shit about your little songs unless they sell out Wembley on a Sunday. So we figured we'd turn to the people who listen to, and buy, these songs we put out and ask the biggest of favours: Let's make this album happen together!!
No matter if we reach our goal or not, every penny we get will be put into getting this album out. And should we surpass the amount, then we'll make merch. And if we drastically surpass the amount, we're heading straight out to Europe to play the autumn of 2017!

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>My name is <strong>Lottie</strong>, and I'm making a record. I'm a Nashville based singer-songwriter, writing and singing what I call <strong>soul-infused Americana</strong>. With this donation-driven crowd funding campaign, I am inviting my fans and patrons to embark on the indescribable journey it is to make a record, and thus, to be an integral part of creating this work of art that I've been meticulously crafting for the past two and a half years. By donating, you are essentially <strong>making my purpose and musical calling in life become a possibility</strong>, and I, for one, happen to think that that's pretty amazing!</p>
<p>Where my  last release, <i>Leaving the Labyrinth</i>, was melancholy, <strong>this new one is triumphant</strong>. Where the last record showed the view from the trenches, this next record shows what happened when I finally made it out. Where <i>Leaving</i> emanated Alison Krauss, Judy Collins and Joni Mitchell, this new work channels <strong>Margo Price</strong>, <strong>Susan Tedeschi</strong> and <strong>Bonnie Raitt</strong>, with a splash of those beautifully sad hues that colored my last release.</p>
<p>The growth that my songwriting and I have gone through since that last record could never have been a possibility without the <strong>support and honest feedback from you</strong>, the fans. In that sense, you really are an essential part of the fabric that makes up my new work and sound in general, so I want to welcome all of you in helping me finish what you've helped me start. <strong>I couldn't have done it without you</strong>, and I honestly couldn't imagine doing this record any other way. Please donate today and experience, with me, the breathtaking views from the other side. Thank you so much, <strong>I love you</strong>!</p>
<p>Lottie</p>

<h3>How could a record possibly cost $26,800?</h3>
<p>Believe it or not, $26,800 is a modest number compared to the cost of many records made these days, especially major label records, which can run into the hundreds of thousands when everything's all said and done. So think about it like this! <strong>All I need to complete my goal, is for 268 of you amazing and lovely people to donate just $100. </strong>That's it! Sounds a little more doable now, right? Here's a more detailed picture of where your money will be going:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$17,500</strong> = 6 musicians for 12 songs at $100 per musician per song + $500 per day for 12 days for the studio rental + $3,000 in producer fees for the amazing guys behind the music + $1,300 for professional audio mixing</li>
<li>
<strong>$900</strong> = mastering of 12 songs at $75 per song</li>
<li>
<strong>$4,000</strong> = manufacturing cost of CDs and 12"" vinyl records</li>
<li>
<strong>$2,000</strong> = photos, artwork, and album cover design</li>
<li><p><strong>$24,400</strong> x <strong>IndieGoGo's 10% fee</strong> = $24,400 + $2,440 = <strong>$26,840</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your generosity and support in helping me reach my goals for this project will be <strong>well rewarded</strong>, because with every donation, you guys receive all kinds of backer-exclusive perk packages! The more you donate, the cooler your rewards get. Some of these <strong>backer-exclusive perks</strong> include an inside view into the creative and record-making process, unreleased songs, exclusive live and behind-the-scenes footage, an hour in the recording studio with me and my production team, and even private concert packages in your very own living room.</p>
<p>Should I not reach my funding goal, I'll do my best to make this record in the most professional way possible, but it will be much more difficult to produce these songs in the way that I envision them, and will take me much longer to complete as I try and save up the money this project will require. Should I somehow raise more than my goal, any extra funds will go towards distribution, publicity, marketing, and advertising for the new record, as well as costs to put a national tour together after the record is released.</p>
<h3>So Why Do I Make Music?</h3>
<p>You may be asking yourself why, exactly, it is that I continue to pursue a fickle and uncertain future in a field where I'm honestly losing far more money than I am making for the first 5 to 10 years, at minimum. The short and honest answer to that question is this: <strong>I don't have a choice</strong>, and <strong>there is no ""Plan B""</strong>. This is it, and I'm going to pursue my God-given purpose and calling in this life until there is simply nothing left for me to give, and nowhere else to go but up.</p>
<p>Far too long I ignored that voice in my head, beckoning  me to pursue my dream of a successful career in music, and eventually, that voice became louder and louder as the days rolled by, until it was an undeniable, torturous scream that I simply couldn't ignore any longer. My fears of vulnerability and rejection had finally been overpowered by my innate<i><strong> need to create music</strong></i>, so I picked up my pen and my guitar, and <strong>I started to write</strong>. </p>
<p>You see, <strong>I know something about keeping feelings in because I have done it my whole life</strong>, and eventually, those feelings begin to eat you from the inside out. Writing and singing about the sadness and hardships in my life is healing for me, and I hope to help others by saying to them in my music, <strong>I've been there too. I know how you feel. You are not alone.</strong></p>
<p> With my music, <strong>I strive to share a message of kindness, strength, and love</strong> to those in need. Music has been my rock and steadfast companion throughout my entire life because music says to its listeners, ""You are not alone. Someone else has been there before. You will get through this."" Love and acceptance are said to be the two things that we as human beings ultimately must have, and sometimes it seems like those two things are hard to come by. <strong>Music gives us hope</strong> during those dark times, or it gives solace by saying that someone else has gone through what we're going through. In that sense, <strong>music is power, </strong>and if I have the power to make someone feel even just a little bit better and less alone because of a song of mine that they can relate to, then I've done a small part in making the world a better place. <strong>Music is my gift to the world</strong>, and my ultimate goal is just to share it with a willing and responsive audience that will use my words however they need, to get where they're going.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In addition to helping me spread a message of love and kindness through the power of music,  you are, by donating, giving me the opportunity to fulfill another creative calling of mine by allowing me to become what I call a <strong>""warrior of the arts,""</strong> specifically music. It is my belief that good music,<strong> music that has both substance <i>and</i> appeal</strong>, is dying a slow and painful death, due to the new and ever-evolving mechanics of the music industry that hardly, if ever, benefit the artists and songwriters who work so tirelessly to create the music you know and love. Simply put, because of ever more common music streaming services that pay artists a mere $0.00058 or less per song play, there is virtually no money to be made for independent artists such as myself, until a certain threshold has been crossed, and oddly enough, this threshold is extraordinarily difficult to cross without proper funding. It's a catch-22, as you all can imagine. There's a definite ""chicken or the egg"" dilemma, and it is a problem that I face head-on every single day. So, in addition to fulfilling my own creative musical needs and aspirations by recording this new record, my hope is that with more visibility in the public eye that results from a very successful record release, I can fulfill my intentions of <strong>advocating for all musicians and artists in every way necessary</strong> to insight real change and ensure that we are, one day, paid fairly.</p>

<h3><i>Who I am and Why I'm Here</i></h3>
<p>My name's Leslie McKee and I'm an independent Christian music artist, worship leader, musician, and roster artist with <a href=""https://creativesoulrecords.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Creative Soul Records</a>.  I'm super excited to let you know that I've been working on my first full-length recording project!  It's actually been in the works for some time now, but like I said, life comes at us and it has come at me full on for the past few years.  There have been many times I've felt like giving up, but I've come out on the other side alive and full of hope, and in turn, want to encourage others to hold on.  I've pretty much lived out 2 Corinthians 4: 8-10: <i>We are pressed on every side by troubles, but we are not crushed.  We are perplexed, but not driven to despair.  We are hunted down, but never abandoned by God.  We get knocked down, but we are not destroyed.  Through suffering, our bodies continue to share in the death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus may also be seen in our bodies. </i></p>
<p><i>​</i>I've teamed up with Eric Copeland of Creative Soul Records to create the best product possible for you.  He has a heart for giving voice to  independent artists, helps us to reach our creative goals and equips us to do the work God has created us to do.  For this project, he has put together a team of the best players in Nashville.  We have put together an incredible track list  of songs, including songs that I have co-written, songs from other writer-friends, and songs that were acquired through Word Records.  In addition to the amazing players and producers I've worked with on this project, I've also had the opportunity to work with incredible vocal producers.  I want to tell you so much more about all these people that were involved and the process of getting to this point, but I'm going to save that for an update that will follow soon.  The album is going to be amazing and will show quite a different side of me than what was heard on my debut EP, <i>True to You</i>.  </p>
<p>I've been overwhelmed by the support and encouragement of family, friends, and fans since stepping out in ministry, and I would like to invite you to partner with me on getting these songs of hope out to the world. <i> <strong>Together, we can make a difference!</strong></i></p>
<h3><i>So...how can you be involved?</i></h3>
<p>That's a great question and I have a couple answers for you.  One way to help is to offer prayer support.  Prayer is such a vital part in all aspects of this kind of undertaking: from choosing and writing songs, to petitioning for the means to complete it, and to getting the finished product into the hands of people who need to hear the message of the songs.  </p>
<p>Another way to help is to contribute financially to the project.  The overall cost of the album will be around $25,000.  I've set a goal of $5000 to help see us through the end of production.  We've been able to track the songs with the band and I've recently been able to cut vocals and do a photo shoot.  Now we're in the home stretch!  The songs need to be mixed and mastered, album artwork needs to be done, and lastly,  the CDs will be sent off for duplication.  </p>
<p>Perhaps you're not able to contribute but you'd still like to show your support. Social media is a great way to get news out quickly to a lot of people.  Please consider sharing this with your friends on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.  </p>
<h3><i>What's in it for you?</i></h3>
<p>We are putting together some great perks for you as a way to say thank you for your support. You'll be the <i>first</i> to hear of updates as they're available.  Plus, you'll experience joy in knowing your contribution will help in sharing music that will influence and make a difference in the lives of others.    </p>
<h3><i>What happens to any additional funds that are raised? </i></h3>
<p>We had some songs that didn't make the cut on this CD, so there is talk of doing an EP to follow-up within a year of this album release.  Funds could go toward production on the EP, production on video for some of the songs, promotion and marketing of the new songs, and/or toward touring expenses for sharing the new songs.  </p>
<h3><i>Risks &amp; Challenges</i></h3>
<p>It is not easy for me to ask for financial support and doing so creates a sense of vulnerability.  It's easy to feel that there are so many other worthy causes out there for people to contribute to, why would they choose to help me meet my goal?  </p>
<p>I'm launching this campaign as we enter into the Thanksgiving and Christmas seasons which may cause decreased visibility of the campaign.  </p>
<p>My response to both concerns is prayer and trusting that God hasn't brought me this far to abandon me, but rather plans to do great things through the message of the songs. </p>

My name's Leslie McKee and I'm an independent Christian music artist, worship leader, musician, and roster artist with Creative Soul Records.  I'm super excited to let you know that I've been working on my first full-length recording project!  It's actually been in the works for some time now, but like I said, life comes at us and it has come at me full on for the past few years.  There have been many times I've felt like giving up, but I've come out on the other side alive and full of hope, and in turn, want to encourage others to hold on.  I've pretty much lived out 2 Corinthians 4: 8-10: We are pressed on every side by troubles, but we are not crushed.  We are perplexed, but not driven to despair.  We are hunted down, but never abandoned by God.  We get knocked down, but we are not destroyed.  Through suffering, our bodies continue to share in the death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus may also be seen in our bodies. 
​I've teamed up with Eric Copeland of Creative Soul Records to create the best product possible for you.  He has a heart for giving voice to  independent artists, helps us to reach our creative goals and equips us to do the work God has created us to do.  For this project, he has put together a team of the best players in Nashville.  We have put together an incredible track list  of songs, including songs that I have co-written, songs from other writer-friends, and songs that were acquired through Word Records.  In addition to the amazing players and producers I've worked with on this project, I've also had the opportunity to work with incredible vocal producers.  I want to tell you so much more about all these people that were involved and the process of getting to this point, but I'm going to save that for an update that will follow soon.  The album is going to be amazing and will show quite a different side of me than what was heard on my debut EP, True to You.  
I've been overwhelmed by the support and encouragement of family, friends, and fans since stepping out in ministry, and I would like to invite you to partner with me on getting these songs of hope out to the world.  Together, we can make a difference!
So...how can you be involved?
That's a great question and I have a couple answers for you.  One way to help is to offer prayer support.  Prayer is such a vital part in all aspects of this kind of undertaking: from choosing and writing songs, to petitioning for the means to complete it, and to getting the finished product into the hands of people who need to hear the message of the songs.  
Another way to help is to contribute financially to the project.  The overall cost of the album will be around $25,000.  I've set a goal of $5000 to help see us through the end of production.  We've been able to track the songs with the band and I've recently been able to cut vocals and do a photo shoot.  Now we're in the home stretch!  The songs need to be mixed and mastered, album artwork needs to be done, and lastly,  the CDs will be sent off for duplication.  
Perhaps you're not able to contribute but you'd still like to show your support. Social media is a great way to get news out quickly to a lot of people.  Please consider sharing this with your friends on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.  
What's in it for you?
We are putting together some great perks for you as a way to say thank you for your support. You'll be the first to hear of updates as they're available.  Plus, you'll experience joy in knowing your contribution will help in sharing music that will influence and make a difference in the lives of others.    
What happens to any additional funds that are raised? 
We had some songs that didn't make the cut on this CD, so there is talk of doing an EP to follow-up within a year of this album release.  Funds could go toward production on the EP, production on video for some of the songs, promotion and marketing of the new songs, and/or toward touring expenses for sharing the new songs.  
Risks & Challenges
It is not easy for me to ask for financial support and doing so creates a sense of vulnerability.  It's easy to feel that there are so many other worthy causes out there for people to contribute to, why would they choose to help me meet my goal?  
I'm launching this campaign as we enter into the Thanksgiving and Christmas seasons which may cause decreased visibility of the campaign.  
My response to both concerns is prayer and trusting that God hasn't brought me this far to abandon me, but rather plans to do great things through the message of the songs. 

Closing thoughts
Thank you so much for stopping by my page and for supporting this project in whatever way you have chosen.  Please feel free to visit my website for more information about what I do, to read my blog posts, or to listen to songs from my EP.  I'd also love to have you join me on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.   

~ Leslie

<h2><strong>AMERICANA!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Pegasus: The Orchestra</strong> is dedicated to bringing ""symphony hall"" sounds to intimate venues, making full-bodied orchestral arrangements accessible to everyone. On <strong>April 12, 2018</strong>, we will present three American masterpieces that everyone loves and recognizes: <strong>Copland's Appalachian Spring</strong>, <strong>Barber's</strong> incredibly moving and poignant <strong>Adagio for Strings</strong>, and the premiere of <strong>Karen Hakobyan's arrangement of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue</strong>. At its largest, our ensemble will be eighteen-strong.</p>
<h2><strong>FLEET FOR FLIGHT</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The good news: </strong> We are compact.  In our largest configuration, <strong>Pegasus: The Orchestra</strong> stands at 35 members.  We are flexible.  We can perform works as duos, trios, septets, octets, string orchestras, winds, all the way up to full orchestra.  We do NOT require a huge venue.  This keeps costs low.  We have top-notch principal players whom we feature in our chamber series, fulfilling our mission to give rising musicians a platform for artistic expression and plenty of opportunities to perform.  We have a composer-arranger as our founder, artistic director, and principal conductor:  Karen Hakobyan is the resident musician who can take a piece by George Gershwin and create the special arrangement for a Pegasus ensemble to take on the road and share with American cities and American citizens in them in venues where orchestral music of this caliber and on this level is rarely heard.  </p>
<h3><strong><i>Yes.</i></strong></h3>
<p><strong>We want to take AMERICANA! on the road.</strong>  Jersey City is its birthplace, and we need your help to launch it on April 12th.  <strong><u>The first $12,000 of our budget will accomplish April.</u> </strong>It will pay for licensing, score rentals, honoraria for the orchestra, promotion, and staffing.  But here is our vision:  we have created this program specifically with bringing it to more and more people as our goal.</p>
<p>Mana Contemporary is also in Chicago and Miami.  We have hopes to expand the Music Residency to those two cities.  It is a plan right now, not yet a reality, because even though the buildings are there, and we may soon have pianos in those buildings, there is the logistical reality of transporting an orchestra still to cope with.  </p>
<p><strong><i>That's where you come in.</i></strong></p>
<p>We've also heard from a presenter with a venue in Philadelphia.  He's ready and willing to collaborate with Pegasus.  Boston.  California.  Connecticut.  New York. Southhampton.  The potential exists for us to have an extensive road trip, bringing world-class performances in a scaled-down orchestra to small venues at a reduced cost in each of these states and cities.</p>
<p>For that, we need the other <strong>$36,000*</strong> just to get a leg up.  It won't cover all our costs, but our partners in these other cities will be meeting us halfway in many cases.  Some are presenters who can provide the venue, or accommodation, or both, but may not be able to pay the orchestra, or the transportation.  Each situation is different, but each and every partnership has a similar goal and objective:  we want to bring affordable and accessible world class performances to people, neighborhoods, and venues where they don't currently exist.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>The first $5K we see donated after our April 12th budget is met and spent will be allocated to hiring a </strong>project-based <strong>grant-writer. Your donations will fuel our long-term prospects for thriving as well as this short-term project.</strong>
</h3>

<p><i>*Just a footnote, for a little perspective.  A concert that was recently planned for Carnegie Hall had a budget of $50K for publicity.  That's right.  One concert, one evening, $50K just for the publicity budget, which did not, incidentally, include television; just print, online, radio, and email.  We're looking for $50K to help us fund a TOUR.  Multiple performances in multiple cities.</i></p>

<h2>MUSIC EDUCATION &amp; AMERICANA!​</h2>
<p>There is something else, VERY important, that we want to do in the course of our <strong>AMERICANA</strong>! rollout, and in ALL our endeavors as Pegasus expands its projects and horizons:  we want to be able to invite buses full of schoolchildren in each and every city we visit or occupy (in the case of our residencies) and their teachers and families to visit us in our musical home.  We want them to see us at work, and not only for formal performances, but we'd like to have schoolchildren come to working rehearsals to see how an orchestra puts a concert together, how a conductor works from a score, how each member of the orchestra is integral to the whole.  We would like to make this a formal lecture-rehearsal-performance series, designed to inspire, inform, and enlarge the hearts and minds of young people in our communities.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;""><i>It isn't part of this project or fundraiser today, but we want to share with you our larger vision, just so you know that we have no plans to go anywhere anytime soon:  As Pegasus grows and gains its footing here in Jersey City and perhaps in Chicago and Miami, we hope very much to get started on much more extensive youth programming than what we just described.  We have a dream.  We would like to have a fully functional professional youth orchestra some day.  Help us now with our short-term goal, and you will be helping us on our way toward this long-horizon goal, too.  The more we do now, the more momentum we build, the more visibility we have, the more people know about us, the sooner that can happen.</i></p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>SUPPORTING EMERGING COMPOSERS WITH AMERICANA PART II!</h2>
<p>For <strong>AMERICANA PART II</strong> we are right here, right now announcing <strong>a call for works by living American composers</strong>.  The composer who wins will have their music premiered in the Fall program, which will include music by Bernstein.  </p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2><strong><u>LOOKING FOR MORE?  WHO WE ARE.</u></strong></h2>
<p><strong>We are Pegasus: The Orchestra</strong>, a New York-based professional orchestra  currently in residence at Mana Contemporary, with an <strong>Orchestra Series</strong>, a<strong> Chamber Series</strong>, a <strong>Piano Series</strong>, and plans for <strong>World Music</strong>,<strong> Jazz</strong>, and<strong> Music Education </strong>on the boards.*</p>
<p>We have ambitious plans because we believe <i>passionately</i> that</p>
<ul>
<li>rising musicians must be empowered with artistic freedom and ample opportunity to perform;</li>
<li>artists should have an environment that fosters creative thought and expression to promote innovative repertoire and showcase world premieres;</li>
<li>music can weave a strong community fabric when we bring musicians and audiences having diverse cultural backgrounds together;</li>
<li>youth need and deserve music education, and that music education is integral to human education;</li>
<li>music has the power to promote humanity and equality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ambitious plans, yes, and ambitious budgets.  But not backbreaking budgets.  Not the kind of budgets that call for $50-and-up-ticket prices.  In fact, it is also our deeply felt hope to make as many of our performances free or close-to-free as possible, so that anyone who wants to hear highest level performances of superb music may do so.  That is why we are asking for your help.  We cannot do this without your support, and we know you are with us.  Musicians need to perform, communities need world-class music, and kids need music education.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:120px;""><strong>We are deeply honored and grateful to Mana Contemporary for granting us this Residency.  It is offering us the possibility to realize our vision, and our vision is big, and it is a little different.  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522205199/kgjyxyiiawjvg2zhmz3w.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">We are not different for the sake of being different.  Quite the contrary.  Each of us is a quintessentially professional musician, has studied in conservatory, and has performance credits, often internationally.  We perform at the very highest level.  We dress professionally.  Our venue is professionally equipped.  There is not one iota of “funk” in what we present.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">What we <strong><i>do</i></strong> suggest, however, is that our audience need not feel it must also be professional.  We want our doors to be open to everyone in the communities we play in, whatever their means, whatever their backgrounds.  We want people to feel comfortable at our events.  It sounds simple and easy, but it definitely is not.  It will take time to build relationships with our neighbors, to build trust and rapport.  <i>To build trust with you, our donors.</i>  We are asking you to give us a chance to begin that process.  Just a head-start.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">We are not sold on the “outreach” model, where concerts are brought in as some kind of charitable event.  As we proposed above, we want to weave a community fabric with music as the catalyst; a human fabric where music brings human beings together who might otherwise never meet, never be in the same space together, and makes it possible for them to relate to each other in new and powerful ways.  We want to do this often, on an ongoing basis. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">And when we take our programs on the road, we want to create the same atmosphere of communion with local neighborhoods, whether we are performing in a Mana Contemporary residency in Chicago or Miami, or in a venue where we’ve been invited in some other city or state.  We don’t just want to reach out (there? that’s already better than outreach, isn’t it?), but we want everyone to feel they can reach<i> in––</i>to us.  Our doors are open and our music is available to any and all who want to hear it, and in intimate, comfortable, affordable surroundings.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">A friend in our circle once said, “We artists, we really believe that we can save the world.”  Well, maybe not quite, but close; something like that!  One of Margaret Mead’s most compelling quotes was: <i>“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.”</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">We don’t doubt it.</p>
<p>We have been in existence since just October 2017, and in this short time, have already had three sold-out performances, launched a piano series, a chamber series, and an orchestra series.  Our performances have garnered positive media attention.  We are excited, our supporters are excited, and our vision of where we want to go is becoming clear.  It is also very clear that we need financial support.  But not as much as you might think.</p>

<h2><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>If we miss the boat, and don't raise $48,000 in this campaign, the consequences will be long-lasting.  Assuming we raise only enough to get us through April 12th, that means that our plans to bring <strong>AMERICANA! </strong>to cities like Chicago and Miami are not going to be realized.  Will Philadelphia, New York, or Connecticut be possible?  Only if the hosts can get grants to fund the entire concert, and that's a long shot.  These are collaborative opportunities.  And if we don't get a tour for <strong>AMERICANA!</strong> we are losing performance opportunities for our orchestra members, and failing to deliver on two core elements of our mission.  We don't want to go there.</p>
<p>And <strong>AMERICANA PART II</strong> will surely be in doubt.</p>
<p>We are going to promote this campaign vigorously, through every channel we can imagine.  Every member of <strong>Pegasus: The Orchestra </strong>will be asked to share it in their social media channels, and our staff are all doing the same.</p>
<h2><strong>You</strong></h2>
<p>We understand that not every person who has taken the time to read this campaign can contribute money.  Money is not the only thing of value in an effort like this.  We value your time, your thoughts, your perspectives, and your network of friends.  Please, let us know what you think about what we are doing.  Write to us. </p>

It isn't part of this project or fundraiser today, but we want to share with you our larger vision, just so you know that we have no plans to go anywhere anytime soon:  As Pegasus grows and gains its footing here in Jersey City and perhaps in Chicago and Miami, we hope very much to get started on much more extensive youth programming than what we just described.  We have a dream.  We would like to have a fully functional professional youth orchestra some day.  Help us now with our short-term goal, and you will be helping us on our way toward this long-horizon goal, too.  The more we do now, the more momentum we build, the more visibility we have, the more people know about us, the sooner that can happen.
 
SUPPORTING EMERGING COMPOSERS WITH AMERICANA PART II!
For AMERICANA PART II we are right here, right now announcing a call for works by living American composers.  The composer who wins will have their music premiered in the Fall program, which will include music by Bernstein.  
 
LOOKING FOR MORE?  WHO WE ARE.
We are Pegasus: The Orchestra, a New York-based professional orchestra  currently in residence at Mana Contemporary, with an Orchestra Series, a Chamber Series, a Piano Series, and plans for World Music, Jazz, and Music Education on the boards.*
We have ambitious plans because we believe passionately that

rising musicians must be empowered with artistic freedom and ample opportunity to perform;
artists should have an environment that fosters creative thought and expression to promote innovative repertoire and showcase world premieres;
music can weave a strong community fabric when we bring musicians and audiences having diverse cultural backgrounds together;
youth need and deserve music education, and that music education is integral to human education;
music has the power to promote humanity and equality.

Ambitious plans, yes, and ambitious budgets.  But not backbreaking budgets.  Not the kind of budgets that call for $50-and-up-ticket prices.  In fact, it is also our deeply felt hope to make as many of our performances free or close-to-free as possible, so that anyone who wants to hear highest level performances of superb music may do so.  That is why we are asking for your help.  We cannot do this without your support, and we know you are with us.  Musicians need to perform, communities need world-class music, and kids need music education.
We are deeply honored and grateful to Mana Contemporary for granting us this Residency.  It is offering us the possibility to realize our vision, and our vision is big, and it is a little different.  
We are not different for the sake of being different.  Quite the contrary.  Each of us is a quintessentially professional musician, has studied in conservatory, and has performance credits, often internationally.  We perform at the very highest level.  We dress professionally.  Our venue is professionally equipped.  There is not one iota of “funk” in what we present.
What we do suggest, however, is that our audience need not feel it must also be professional.  We want our doors to be open to everyone in the communities we play in, whatever their means, whatever their backgrounds.  We want people to feel comfortable at our events.  It sounds simple and easy, but it definitely is not.  It will take time to build relationships with our neighbors, to build trust and rapport.  To build trust with you, our donors.  We are asking you to give us a chance to begin that process.  Just a head-start.
We are not sold on the “outreach” model, where concerts are brought in as some kind of charitable event.  As we proposed above, we want to weave a community fabric with music as the catalyst; a human fabric where music brings human beings together who might otherwise never meet, never be in the same space together, and makes it possible for them to relate to each other in new and powerful ways.  We want to do this often, on an ongoing basis. 
And when we take our programs on the road, we want to create the same atmosphere of communion with local neighborhoods, whether we are performing in a Mana Contemporary residency in Chicago or Miami, or in a venue where we’ve been invited in some other city or state.  We don’t just want to reach out (there? that’s already better than outreach, isn’t it?), but we want everyone to feel they can reach in––to us.  Our doors are open and our music is available to any and all who want to hear it, and in intimate, comfortable, affordable surroundings.
A friend in our circle once said, “We artists, we really believe that we can save the world.”  Well, maybe not quite, but close; something like that!  One of Margaret Mead’s most compelling quotes was: “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.”
We don’t doubt it.
We have been in existence since just October 2017, and in this short time, have already had three sold-out performances, launched a piano series, a chamber series, and an orchestra series.  Our performances have garnered positive media attention.  We are excited, our supporters are excited, and our vision of where we want to go is becoming clear.  It is also very clear that we need financial support.  But not as much as you might think.

Risks & Challenges
If we miss the boat, and don't raise $48,000 in this campaign, the consequences will be long-lasting.  Assuming we raise only enough to get us through April 12th, that means that our plans to bring AMERICANA! to cities like Chicago and Miami are not going to be realized.  Will Philadelphia, New York, or Connecticut be possible?  Only if the hosts can get grants to fund the entire concert, and that's a long shot.  These are collaborative opportunities.  And if we don't get a tour for AMERICANA! we are losing performance opportunities for our orchestra members, and failing to deliver on two core elements of our mission.  We don't want to go there.
And AMERICANA PART II will surely be in doubt.
We are going to promote this campaign vigorously, through every channel we can imagine.  Every member of Pegasus: The Orchestra will be asked to share it in their social media channels, and our staff are all doing the same.
You
We understand that not every person who has taken the time to read this campaign can contribute money.  Money is not the only thing of value in an effort like this.  We value your time, your thoughts, your perspectives, and your network of friends.  Please, let us know what you think about what we are doing.  Write to us.

<h3>Who I am</h3>
<p>My name is Emile Janse and I have been playing music for healing for around 5 years now. I am 25 now and when I was almost 18, a good friend of mine introduced me to the Native American Flute. At that point my relationship to music became deeply entwined with my desire to experience blissful states of peace and tranquility. I played many kinds of indigenous and cultural flutes from around the world and in my early twenties I picked up the didgeridoo and began practicing Tuvan Throatsinging. After many years of self-teaching I have reached a proficiency that I share as a gift to groups of people.</p>
<p>This campaign is important to me because I want to put high quality sounds out that come from what I do and what I'm very good at bringing to the world. I have done many spontaneous youtube videos and facebook livestreams, but I've never sat down and really worked with the sound or had it produced such that someone or myself would want to listen to it over and over again. Creating and producing quality music is a real project, and I think it is worth it so people can experience what I do.</p>
<p>Contributors will help me achieve the creation of quality musical recordings particularly with the flute, handpan, didgeridoo, and overtone throatsinging. All of these instruments and musical practices I do very proficiently and have played for thousands of people around the bay area and California. to support me makes the gift of these sounds available to even more people, and also helps me unlock more ability to travel and play around the world because I can send people good demonstrations of what I do so they know it is a good idea to bring me over.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I need</h3>
<p>I am asking for $1,000 to pay 1 or 2 engineers (one being Nick Hart) and <a href=""https://outland.studio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Outland Recording Studio</a> who are willing to help me produce this in their free time, because it an interesting and different project. They are being so generous and I want to support them as much as possible for helping me record and produce this healing music. Anything over $1,000 will go to them as well.</p>
<p>For people that help fund this project I am offering private sound healing sessions with the didgeridoo, flute, frame drum, handpan, and voice. Or, private music lessons on the didgeridoo, flute, or throatsinging.</p>
<p>Anyone that contributes will also receive a link to download the music when it comes out.</p>
<p>Spread the word, grateful to anyone and everyone that is willing to share this campaign as well :)</p>

<p><strong>My Journey from the back-forty to Music City USA:</strong></p>
<p>On August 5th, 2012, I moved from my hometown of Latham, IL to Music City U.S.A. to chase my dream of being “Eric Burgett,” the country artist. My first step was to hunker down and learn to be the best songwriter I could be, so I bundled up my cornfield roots with my 2 hands on 88 keys, and I hit the ground running. While writing every day and being present in the Nashville community, I knew that maintaining a solid performance schedule was crucial, so I traveled back and forth between Tennessee and my Illinois territory playing county fairs, bars, college shows, and festivals.</p>
<p>After a few months of living in Nashville, I met Grammy-nominated producer Matt Mcclure and we immediately struck up a friendship amongst the numerous cold beer conversations and talks about songs I had been writing. In September 2017, I signed an artist management and production deal with Matt and his company “Bow to Stern Group” after having released my current single, “Town You Never Heard Of.” It has been a fun ride so far, and I am thrilled to follow up the single with my debut record that will consist of 10 very special songs I have poured my heart and soul into...but I need YOUR help!!!!</p>
<p><strong>So what’s happening now?</strong></p>
<p>I am recording my debut record! I know deep down that it’s the right moment to release these tunes to the world and keep them from collecting any more dust! When the songs are ready to rock, sometimes it’s hard to roll, due to financial constraints. “INDIEGOGO” is a crowdfunding site that has been responsible for aiding in the careers of creators like me, who have a passion for music. “INDIEGOGO” allows artists to fund their projects and minimize debt (hopefully all of it!), and in return, anyone who pledges will be rewarded based on his or her “tier of giving” (see the rewards to the right of the page). Most importantly, we are all in this TOGETHER, and YOU will be a cohesive part of the project. Following the release of my project, the music will live on forever, so your generous gift will keep on giving and will spark more momentum, as time goes on.</p>
<p>My dad has always said, “Surround yourself with good people,” and that’s exactly what I’ve done, ever since moving to Nashville. From friends and co-writers to my management team and my amazing wife (as of recent!!), Aimee (and our dog Nora :)), I believe I have a strong and supportive circle of people around me to really power this thing, upon a (fingers crossed!) successful Indiegogo campaign. </p>
<p><strong>The Music</strong></p>
<p>If you know me, you know my heart is full of back-forty skylines, sunsets, cornfield kisses, John Deere implements, hole-in-the-wall bars...it goes on and on and on...These songs are just the beginning of something bigger. I have written countless numbers of songs that I believe are ready to ROCK!</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>Through the Indiegogo platform, my goal is to raise $75,000 in 42 days to fund production, promotion, marketing, and branding of my debut 10-song record with my producer, Matt McClure. Everything will take place in Nashville, TN with the best people in the business (musicians, photographers, promoters, etc.) for the best fans in the world, YOU!!!  Upon finishing the record, it will be pressed and also available for download and streaming.  I know that $75,000 ain’t a small number, but with YOUR help, I have faith we can do it. From merchandise packages, truck bed concerts, and more, I can promise you a memorable reward in return for your generosity. </p>
<p><strong>My team and I have strategically planned our budgeting, based on recording, promoting, and delivering the final product with the money we raise.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></p>
<p>As with any fundraising project, there are risks and challenges. The amount of funding we raise will determine if the project will happen in a timely fashion. Our plan is to start recording in the Fall and have the project ready at the beginning of the year 2019. If we don't reach our goal of $75,000, the project will take longer to finish. Thankfully, the funds we DO raise will go towards the project and push it forward. When I release the project, no doubt it will have have a significant impact on my music career and will open more doors for me as an artist, which means I will be forever grateful for your support.</p>
<p>Throughout the recording process, you as a “backer” will receive ample updates on how the project is moving along. Most importantly, you as a “backer” will receive music BEFORE anyone else does, because, without YOU, none of this would be possible. As for the rewards, I will have a team behind me that will help me successfully get them to you in a timely fashion, following the close of the campaign!</p>
<p>I truly appreciate your consideration in donating to my project. I have poured my heart and soul into these tunes, and I hope they will mean as much to you as they do to me.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Eric Burgett</p>

<h3>So why are we doing this?</h3>
<p>1) Because...over the years, music has saved us. More than once. We aim to create wildly authentic music and tell honest stories that we can share with a world in desperate need of inspiration. </p>
<p>2) Because...we want to create community around the notion that beauty will save the world. We say that a lot. It’s a constant reminder to us to keep going because when someone is inspired, they change the world. There are so many stories we could tell about conversations had in the grocery, at the bank, running into someone, MAYBE YOU, at the park or in an email or card we’ve gotten, talking about the ways the music we’ve written and shared has affected you, moved you, given you space to wrestle with things or simply reminded you that you’re not alone. This is the spark. Those conversations and encounters are the fuel to make more music - you inspire us, music is born, you get inspired, you do something inspiring. The circle widens. Ever expanding.</p>
<p>3) Because...our band has several members. Members with jobs, kids, bills, they have never ending to do lists and full calendars. It’s extremely important to us as we all pour ourselves into this project, we ensure not only that we can share it with the world, BUT we want to take care of the community we’ve been building as we go.</p>

1) Because...over the years, music has saved us. More than once. We aim to create wildly authentic music and tell honest stories that we can share with a world in desperate need of inspiration. 
2) Because...we want to create community around the notion that beauty will save the world. We say that a lot. It’s a constant reminder to us to keep going because when someone is inspired, they change the world. There are so many stories we could tell about conversations had in the grocery, at the bank, running into someone, MAYBE YOU, at the park or in an email or card we’ve gotten, talking about the ways the music we’ve written and shared has affected you, moved you, given you space to wrestle with things or simply reminded you that you’re not alone. This is the spark. Those conversations and encounters are the fuel to make more music - you inspire us, music is born, you get inspired, you do something inspiring. The circle widens. Ever expanding.
3) Because...our band has several members. Members with jobs, kids, bills, they have never ending to do lists and full calendars. It’s extremely important to us as we all pour ourselves into this project, we ensure not only that we can share it with the world, BUT we want to take care of the community we’ve been building as we go.

So why are YOU doing this?
Your contributions will help us with costs like:
Audio mixing/audio mastering (currently in progress)
Song copywriting
Design (album art, t-shirt design, merch designs)
Printing CDs & Vinyl (album covers, discs)
Filming videos
Creating merchandise (t-shirts, mugs, hats, art etc.)

<p>SAXON MOON’S NEWEST CD, AWAKENING: Help us get it across the finish line.</p>
<p>Saxon Moon is back in the studio, putting the finishing touches on their latest CD,  AWAKENING, which promises to be their most amazing musical production yet.</p>
<p>We chose the title, AWAKENING, because Saxon Moon has gone thru some pretty significant transitions this past year, and we feel we are breathing new life into the band, starting with this CD. For AWAKENING, we chose more traditional Celtic, Irish, Nordic, and Medieval songs for you. And you are going to hear a lot of whistle and powerful drums with our own Saxon Moon twist.</p>
<p>In the past, we’ve always been able to finance our albums on our own, but 2017 presented many unexpected challenges for Saxon Moon, making it impossible to complete the CD on our own this time. In addition to the costs involved in this final stage of recording a CD, like CD artwork; getting the CD pressed; and production costs (production, sound engineering, mixing, mastering, etc.), we have equipment that needs improvements and repairs for live performances; musicians to pay; and merchandise that has to be ordered.</p>
<p>AWAKENING has been in the works for well over a year, and is finally ready for our fans. We believe it will be our best CD yet, and we are pretty sure you will agree with us on that! As independent musicians, the biggest challenge in putting out a new CD is funding. That’s where you come in. We need $8,000 to finish the CD and cover all the expenses we previously explained or we won’t be able to bring you awesome new music this year.  </p>
<p>So we are turning to our strongest supporters, our fans, to ask for contributions. We just can’t finish this CD without you. And supporting our campaign is your way of supporting independent music and musicians.</p>
<p>In exchange, Saxon Moon has put together some fun and exciting rewards for all of you to enjoy - Mega Merchandise Package; VIP Experience Package; Musical instruments from the band’s personal collection that were played live and on previous CD’s; VIP House Concert; and best of all, the “Executive Producer”! The guys donated a lot of their personal gear so there's A LOT of reward options. Please be sure to read them all!</p>
<p>We have only 30 days to pull this together and make it a reality. So please, help us finish this amazing music CD, and be a part of making it happen. We know Awakenings will become a reality with the support of our fans!</p>
<p><strong>*** Please message me for shipping rates outside of the USA. ***</strong></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We in URN® have felt extremely blessed by our fans over the span of our seventeen-year career as music is something that sustains us as people, and it allows to feel and express our personalities and allow us to connect with others that we might not be able to do otherwise.   Many of our fans have given us amazing feedback about our recent videos for some of our songs, expressing their appreciation for what some say is becoming a lost art form, and that they would like to see us produce more.</p>
<p>It is our mission statement in URN to provide our fans with the best possible products and experience when sharing in our music.    So we have been presented an incredible opportunity to raise the level of our production by working with Emmy Nominated make-up and special effects artist Cleve Hall, who many know from his own reality show MONSTER MAN on the SyFy Network. Besides creating FX for films, Mr Hall has worked with bands like KISS, Alice Cooper, Marilyn Manson, Insane Clown Posse, Tenaceous D, and DEVO, who actually wrote a song about him!</p>
<p>Seeking the creative opportunities available working with independent filmmakers and music acts, Mr. Hall has expressed a desire to produce/film a promotional video for our song ""Black Widow"" from our Epiphany album and we will be filming on location in Florida in April 2017.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As one can expect, when working with the caliber and talent of an artist known world wide for 40 years of creating the fantastic, the end result of the product will be far superior to all previous releases.   Some great feedback we received from fans is they would like to us to get even more visual in our story line in our song videos and Mr. Hall has an fantastic vision for how he wishes to achieve this.</p>
<p>With this campaign, we are seeking to help raise funds to defray/cover the cost of the materials that are needed for set construction and costume designs for this production.   This will allow for the vision to come to life as it will be in a dark fantasy-whimsical setting where we weave a tale of misdirected romance.  </p>
<p>For this campaign we have some special perks that for those who make contributions will receive special URN merchandise items with some only available from this campaign such as a collector t-shirt in a commemorative display box!</p>
<p>All proceeds from this campaign will go directly towards the production cost of this video production and for all those who contribute will also get an exclusive invite to a special advance viewing of a ""director's cut"" of the video before it released worldwide with our media partner High Road Publicity.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This video will also open for us additional opportunities to have our music marketed into major television and film productions and enhance our ability to produce another album for 2017 as many fans have indicated they are hoping to see a new one from us soon.</p>
<p>URN has been blessed in our past to have our music appear on major networks such as SyFy Channel, A&amp;E, and Discovery Channel.    The production of this video will allow for us to further develop these relationship and collaborations and in turn, allow us more opportunities to share interactively with you our fans.</p>

<strong>It's a community thing</strong> </h3><p>By using a crowd-funding website such as Indiegogo , the power is put in the hands of us artists.

<br/><b>The Music</b>
</h3><p>Those who already know the music have said it's like a balm for the soul. A typical example is a recent Shambala Festival, when one fan came to us after the show saying ""Thank you.

We write songs to warm you up. Songs to make you melt a little.  Songs that pick you up and envelop you in a musical ear hug. We love creating music and sharing these good feelings. We have played many gigs and festivals and reached people through music in our professional and musical lives. We now want to bring our gifts together to record one very special album.  

 

This is not just another folk record. 
We will be recording the album with the finest of Bristol's musicians. These recordings will then be flown to LA to receive production magic by cutting-edge virtual reality sound designer and producer John Hendicott. This is going to be a unique and beautiful creation and we cannot wait to make it happen. To make it, we need your help. To cover all basic costs of manufacturing and to pay all those involved fairly we need to raise a minimum of £7,000. The way crowdfunding works is perfect for this project. We are inviting you to pre-order the CD and choose from a number of our special gifts in return for your contribution.  Once ordered you'll be kept  up-to-date with our creative processes and progress, getting to share in the journey as much or as little as you wish.   
It's a community thing By using a crowd-funding website such as Indiegogo , the power is put in the hands of us artists. It's empowering, enabling us to be completely independent and taking away any reliance away on big business.  ""Indiegogo challenges the top-down model by affording artists the opportunity to make their case directly to the public. It's profoundly empowering."" Tanya Shaffer, Campaigner
The Music
Those who already know the music have said it's like a balm for the soul. A typical example is a recent Shambala Festival, when one fan came to us after the show saying ""Thank you.

<h2>""The Singer""</h2>
<p>Hi! Grizél here. I'm (very soon!) releasing an album that I'm really proud of, and I'm really looking forward to sharing it with you all. The album is rooted in Americana and Soul, and follows the journey of a young twenty-something Latina woman, as she searches for meaning and substance and ultimately finds it in the connection with those around her. </p>
<p>My hope is that this album helps you experience something within yourself-- maybe you'll laugh; maybe you'll cry. Maybe your heart will leap with joy. And maybe it will ache with sadness. And hey, maybe your experience is not life changing at all; you just simply enjoy the sounds for the sounds that they are. I see beauty in and welcome all of it.</p>
<h3>A Little About Me...</h3>
<p>I am from a small town in the beautiful Appalachian Mountains, called Johnson City, TN. Johnson City is home for me, and it is where I learned my love for the violin, singing, learning, playing, and writing. And since you asked, I also love playing volleyball. And animals. And when I laugh, most people cannot tell if I am laughing or crying. Because they sound almost exactly the same.</p>
<p>By day, I am a mental health therapist. And by night, I am singing, writing, and creating songs of the soul- both of others and myself. This lifestyle-- being a singer/songwriter therapist-- unfortunately means that I don't have a lot of extra cash lying around. So I'm asking if you would help make this dream become a reality. You will not be disappointed!</p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What you Get</h3>
<p>So I am in need of 8,000 dollars, y'all. I know. I dislike typing it as much as you probably dislike reading it. I have been raising most of it on my own through social media, but I think it is time to take a bigger step.</p>
<p>Where does the money go? All of the money goes toward the work that has been done, is still being done, and that will be done. That's vague. I know. Let me break it down for you.</p>
<p>The album has actually already been recorded by my producer, Mitch Dane. But, until I get the 8k, I will not be able to put that album into your hands. What I am trying to say is that producing the album takes a lot of hard work for my producer friend, Mitch. And until I can get it to him, I don't get to put the album on the iTunes, the Spotify, or the Wal-Mart. Catch my drift?  This is the BIG GOAL.</p>
<p>So, throughout this fundraiser, I'm hoping to incentivize you all with free giveaways, song covers, and other fun promotions. I really want everyone to be involved in this process as much as possible!</p>
<h3>Why Me?</h3>
<p>Yeah. I ask myself this question all the time too. Why would you give money to a girl you may hardly or not at all know? What makes her so different from the millions of other aspiring songwriters out there?</p>
<p>Valid question. I guess the best way for me to answer this is that- I am ready.</p>
<p>I am ready to get my stuff out there. I am ready to be vulnerable. I am ready to experience rejection. I am ready to experience life. I am ready to allow others into my story. I am ready for others to hear the stories that have touched my soul. I am ready for others to hear the amazing musicians that were part of this album.  I am ready for others to experience the excellence that is Mitch Dane. I am ready to be critiqued. I am ready to grow. I am ready to experience fullness in this thing called creativity.</p>
<p>That's it. I'm ready. I know my legs are ready to run. I know my mind is determined. I know my lungs are in good condition. But to finish well in this race, I'll need proper shoes. And having a few cheerleaders along the way would be nice. </p>
<p>That's where you come in.</p>
<p>This is not about “making it.” This is about experiencing the beauty that comes with creating music.</p>
<p>You all are the only way I can do this to my full potential.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Hopefully you have gained an understanding of what the goal is, and how I am striving to meet those goals. I am aware that there are definite hurdles and obstacles that are standing in my way-money being the biggest challenge.</p>
<p>I've invested some of my own money in this album. I'm moving out of my one bedroom apartment to live with a friend, so that I can put that future rent money toward this goal. I a, in the process of selling most of my belongings. I have also minimized my grocery list and don't eat anymore (I'M KIDDING. I shop at Aldi's). All of this to say: I've already made some sacrifices of my own, because this process is worth it.</p>
<p>And I want you to be a part of this. You can trust me to carry this effort out to fruition. WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I am TOTALLY aware that not everyone can contribute monetarily to this album. Finances are a stressful thing. But money isn't the only way to give. Sharing and spreading the word is something anyone can do! You can check out my Indiegogo page. You can share my work on social media. You can tell your plumber to check out this new up and coming musician you know. Anything and everything helps! So please: Tell all your friends. Tell all your enemies! I'm ready to make this dream happen! Who's with me?</p>

<h3>WELCOME TO <i>SINGEN UND SAGEN</i>!</h3>
<p>Greetings from Liza Malamut, Stephen Kennedy and Ben David Aronson, the production team for <i>Singen und Sagen: Music for Peace in a Time of War</i>.  We are all professional musicians and graduates of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York.  In addition to being performers and educators, we are all passionate early music lovers.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">One of the values we treasure most as musicians is to push ourselves not only to achieve the highest standards of professional excellence, but also to use our talents and passions to give back to our community in ways that only we can.  The concert program we are producing, </span><strong><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Singen und Sagen: Music for Peace in a Time of War</i></strong><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">, is a purely musical expression of our wish for peace and good will within our community and all over the world.  We have chosen the music of <strong>Michael Praetorius</strong>, renowned German composer of the seventeenth century, as the perfect embodiment of this wish.  The purpose of our campaign is to raise the remainder of the costs of production which we have not yet covered through our independent efforts.</span></p>
<p>The framework of our program is that of a universal musical sermon during a time of war and strife, based on Praetorius’s interpretation of Martin Luther’s instruction to <strong>“singen und sagen,”</strong> or <strong>“to sing and say.”</strong> In the preface to his <i>Polyhymnia Caduceatrix et Panegyrica</i>, Praetorius writes:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">“...it is not only appropriate to have a CONCIO, a good sermon, but also in addition the necessary CANTIO, good music and song...It is and remains God’s Word in the thinking of the mind, the singing of the voice, and also in the beating and playing upon instruments.”  </p>
<p>Polyhymnia contains some of the most sophisticated of all German sacred music. The collection’s publication date of <strong>1619</strong>, one year after the official beginning of the <strong>Thirty Years’ War</strong>, adds further poignancy to its lushness, as the subsequent years of strife and famine would decimate the forces needed to perform it in full.</p>
<p>To reflect this, pieces from Polyhymnia will be alternated with selected texts, both uplifting and sorrowful, that reflect this theme.  <strong>Nearly four hundred years after its publication, performing such elaborate and joyous music as that of Polyhymnia during times of darkness and despair remains an act of courage and optimism</strong>.</p>
<p>Because of the sheer size of the forces needed, Polyhymnia is seldom programmed in modern performances. However, the musical resources of Rochester, New York provide a rare opportunity to bring this special music, and everything it represents, to life.  The Christ Church Schola Cantorum and Consort, under the direction of Stephen Kennedy, is one of Rochester's  great musical and spiritual treasures.  <strong>On Saturday afternoon, November 11th 2017, along with students, faculty and alumni from the Eastman School of Music, special guest artists, and wonderful community musicians, the Schola will present a rare, free concert of fully orchestrated works from Polyhymnia.</strong></p>
<p>Polyhymnia requires a full instrumentarium of sackbuts, cornetti, violins, dulcians, viols, and more. This provides a special opportunity for students and community members in the city of Rochester to have a hands-on experience making music that is rarely performed even by professionals.  Prominent musicians in the field of early music will coach and perform alongside student instrumentalists. The concert will be an official event at the American Musicological Society's 2017 meeting, which guarantees a packed audience and exciting publicity.</p>
<p>The concert will make full use of the beautiful Christ Church sanctuary and its stunning Craighead-Saunders organ. The instruments, orchestration, pitch standards, and venue placement of the performance will adhere as closely as possible to Praetorius’s own specifications.</p>
<h2>IMPACT</h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong><i>Singen und Sagen</i> will be a fully immersive experience for the music students, Rochester community musicians, and professionals who have chosen to participate.</strong> The immediate impact of the project will serve a rough total of 40 individual students and community musicians. These musicians have already begun the hands-on work of immersing themselves in the music of Praetorius and late Renaissance performance practice to attain skills and knowledge they will apply not only to this concert, but also to future projects of their own.</span></p>
<p><strong>The long-term impact of this project will be much greater</strong>, and extends far beyond our desire to give back to the Rochester community with our individual talents. New performing editions of music from Polyhymnia have been made specifically for this event, but the playability of the music is such that the program can be adapted to suit varying musical resources and circumstances. This aspect of the project ensures that the program may be performed again and again, with diverse groups of instrumentalists and singers, and at a variety of venues. <strong>The creation of <i>Singen und Sagen</i> will result in a sustainable and flexible program that can be used and enjoyed for the benefit of countless communities — students, amateurs, and professionals — for the foreseeable future.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

</div></div>","WELCOME TO SINGEN UND SAGEN!
Greetings from Liza Malamut, Stephen Kennedy and Ben David Aronson, the production team for Singen und Sagen: Music for Peace in a Time of War.  We are all professional musicians and graduates of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York.  In addition to being performers and educators, we are all passionate early music lovers.
One of the values we treasure most as musicians is to push ourselves not only to achieve the highest standards of professional excellence, but also to use our talents and passions to give back to our community in ways that only we can.  The concert program we are producing, Singen und Sagen: Music for Peace in a Time of War, is a purely musical expression of our wish for peace and good will within our community and all over the world.  We have chosen the music of Michael Praetorius, renowned German composer of the seventeenth century, as the perfect embodiment of this wish.  The purpose of our campaign is to raise the remainder of the costs of production which we have not yet covered through our independent efforts.
The framework of our program is that of a universal musical sermon during a time of war and strife, based on Praetorius’s interpretation of Martin Luther’s instruction to “singen und sagen,” or “to sing and say.” In the preface to his Polyhymnia Caduceatrix et Panegyrica, Praetorius writes:
“...it is not only appropriate to have a CONCIO, a good sermon, but also in addition the necessary CANTIO, good music and song...It is and remains God’s Word in the thinking of the mind, the singing of the voice, and also in the beating and playing upon instruments.”  
Polyhymnia contains some of the most sophisticated of all German sacred music. The collection’s publication date of 1619, one year after the official beginning of the Thirty Years’ War, adds further poignancy to its lushness, as the subsequent years of strife and famine would decimate the forces needed to perform it in full.
To reflect this, pieces from Polyhymnia will be alternated with selected texts, both uplifting and sorrowful, that reflect this theme.  Nearly four hundred years after its publication, performing such elaborate and joyous music as that of Polyhymnia during times of darkness and despair remains an act of courage and optimism.
Because of the sheer size of the forces needed, Polyhymnia is seldom programmed in modern performances. However, the musical resources of Rochester, New York provide a rare opportunity to bring this special music, and everything it represents, to life.  The Christ Church Schola Cantorum and Consort, under the direction of Stephen Kennedy, is one of Rochester's  great musical and spiritual treasures.  On Saturday afternoon, November 11th 2017, along with students, faculty and alumni from the Eastman School of Music, special guest artists, and wonderful community musicians, the Schola will present a rare, free concert of fully orchestrated works from Polyhymnia.
Polyhymnia requires a full instrumentarium of sackbuts, cornetti, violins, dulcians, viols, and more. This provides a special opportunity for students and community members in the city of Rochester to have a hands-on experience making music that is rarely performed even by professionals.  Prominent musicians in the field of early music will coach and perform alongside student instrumentalists. The concert will be an official event at the American Musicological Society's 2017 meeting, which guarantees a packed audience and exciting publicity.
The concert will make full use of the beautiful Christ Church sanctuary and its stunning Craighead-Saunders organ. The instruments, orchestration, pitch standards, and venue placement of the performance will adhere as closely as possible to Praetorius’s own specifications.
IMPACT
Singen und Sagen will be a fully immersive experience for the music students, Rochester community musicians, and professionals who have chosen to participate. The immediate impact of the project will serve a rough total of 40 individual students and community musicians. These musicians have already begun the hands-on work of immersing themselves in the music of Praetorius and late Renaissance performance practice to attain skills and knowledge they will apply not only to this concert, but also to future projects of their own.
The long-term impact of this project will be much greater, and extends far beyond our desire to give back to the Rochester community with our individual talents. New performing editions of music from Polyhymnia have been made specifically for this event, but the playability of the music is such that the program can be adapted to suit varying musical resources and circumstances. This aspect of the project ensures that the program may be performed again and again, with diverse groups of instrumentalists and singers, and at a variety of venues. The creation of Singen und Sagen will result in a sustainable and flexible program that can be used and enjoyed for the benefit of countless communities — students, amateurs, and professionals — for the foreseeable future.

What We Need & What You Get
Through traditional grant writing and fundraising, we have raised nearly two thirds of the total funds we need to produce Singen und Sagen.  The additional $2,500 we need would be used for three specific purposes:

 Sponsorships and honorariums for guest professionals and volunteer performers.  We want to fully and generously express our gratitude to everyone lending us their time and talents to help bring our program to life.
Various standard production costs, including printing and distribution of complete performing editions to our many participating musicians.
Professional quality recording and video of our performance, to be used as a record of our efforts and to assist with future productions.

We are also offering some exciting musical perks.  A contribution could get you:

Your name printed in the official concert program
Programs autographed by the performers
A high quality video of the concert
Handwritten thank you notes
CDs featuring members of the Singen und Sagen performance
A free trombone (or sackbut!) lesson
A memorable outdoor performance by Liza (more details in the ""perks"" section)

What happens if we don't reach our funding goal?
Even if we do not reach our goal of $2500, the show will go on! Funds will be evenly distributed among the three purposes as described above.  On the other hand, if we exceed our goal, the extra funding will cover extraneous expenses associated with the project, as well as future costs associated with bringing Singen und Sagen to communities across the United States.

<h3>2 Albums Releasing in One Day</h3>
<p>It's been 2 years since I, The Hyphenate, have released a studio album, but to make up for it, I'm dropping 2 complete albums in one day.  I constantly make such a variety of music that and have a lot of new songs for both underground hip hop and mainstream hip hop fans. One album will cater more to the mainstream hip hop supporters and the other to the underground hip hop supporters.  What you get is 2 totally different sounding albums that captivate the entire spectrum of hip hop music while at the same time still maintaining the lyrical, insightful, thought provoking, and entertaining lyricism/song-writing you've come to expect from me.  The songs I have lined up for these albums are powerful, insightful, fun, charismatic, and moving.  This is my best work yet and your help on this project is going to attribute to making a great impact on, not just hip hop, but all people across the globe that this music will reach to.  Both albums will release on January 30th, 2018.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey! I’m Julie. And I’m Emily. We are the cofounders of Eclectic Comfort.</p>
<p>We started Eclectic Comfort from a desire to bring people together from our community, in our house, listening to and making music together. So we did that. Invited 30 people into our living room and had 5 artists play acoustic sets. No amplification, no overhead lighting. Just the people and the space and the time. That community has continued to grow and develop and we have been so amazed at the talent, creativity and generosity of the people that have been involved. We want to honour that and continue to help musicians and other creatives thrive.</p>
<p>Still with us? Awesome! Our goal is simple: to foster human connection and creative development in our community. We are launching an artist incubator and digital platform to not only showcase their musical talent but also provide support and direction to further their careers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance skill development</li>
<li>Branding and design</li>
<li>Web design and developement</li>
<li>Social media content development</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $20,000 in order to fully launch our digital platform and continue to help local artists grow. We know that this is not enough to last us a year - or even half of one - but it is enough for us to create all of our start up content for the first few months and get the word out! Better still, this will help us continue to run community events while we do so. This will also aid us in getting ourselves out there so that we are better positioned to receive grants in the future.</p>
<p>Your Unique Perks</p>
<ul>
<li>Cozy Coffee Mugs</li>
<li>Wooden Coasters</li>
<li>EC T-Shirts</li>
<li>EC Mystery Swag Bag</li>
<li>Eclectic Comfort in Your Own Home</li>
<li>Kitchen Tunes</li>
</ul>
<p>Every little bit counts. If we don't reach our total goal, we will use every dollar that comes through towards launching. We appreciate everyone's support and we know that even with a little boost, we will be able to go a long way.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are striving to foster human connection and creative development not only in our community but communities around the world. After receiving such positive feedback in Toronto over the past year we have tried the same thing in Denmark, Sweden and France and the response has been overwhelming. Our local community is becoming global. In order to continue to do that, we need some help from you to get started.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Content is a challenge. Businesses big or small have this problem. Once you have an idea, the creation of it requires a vast number of skills to execute. We believe we can overcome this challenge.</p>
<p>We are passionate about the creative industry and the people in our community. Emily is a special effects makeup artist working in film and television who is passionate about art, music and helping other people pursue their dreams. Julie is a musician and video producer for broadcast and online content who is passionate about connecting people to what they need and providing opportunities for creatives to do their best work. Our resident post production supervisor, Andrew Farlow, brings an enormous amount of experience and expertise on both audio and visual effects/editing. With design expertise from Adam Silcox-Vanwyk and cinematography from Justin Yaroski, we are well equipped to create the content required for this endeavour.</p>

<p><strong>SHORT SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>In a perfect world, I will reach my targeted goal of $5,000! But, if this isn’t the case and I fall short, this EP will be put on hold until additional funds can make up the difference, even if it takes an additional year or two. I am very determined and believe in my craft! </p>
<p>To clarify, I created a passion-project cover-EP entitled “Play On” which is available to stream in the above, embedded video (also, here: ) These five songs capture the vibe, emotion, and overall mood of the direction I am heading for with EP 2! With your help, I can bring my original content come to life, with a professional producer I have on board if I reach my goal!</p>
<p><strong>WHY I’M DOING THIS</strong></p>
<p>Recording music has always been a vital and integral part of who I am and how I choose to express myself. Now, I will get the chance to do so professionally, with material I’ve written myself. I have a strong desire to see a full EP of songs come to life, and allow others into an emotional and creative space that I am otherwise very protective over.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU’LL GET</strong></p>
<p>$5,000 is a tight, just slightly over-budgeted sum that will sufficiently fund this entire campaign. I know it is a large amount. Each track will cost about $945, which is $4,725 when multiplied by five. There will also be an additional photoshoot for this project, taxes included, making up the rest of the remaining funds.</p>
<p><u>Below is the list of perks, which can be found on the right.</u></p>
<p><i>$5 - digital copy of EP “”Play On” - five individual cover tracks already recorded, which can be heard in the embedded video above.</i></p>
<p><i>$10 - digital copy of the my “Play On” demo EP and a promise that when this next one is fully funded, it will be sent you as well.</i></p>
<p><i>$15 - thank you letter, digitally or physically sent (up to you!) (+ all of the above perks included).</i></p>
<p><i>$30 - handwritten lyrics and photo paper copies of my new single covers from “Play On” (+ all of the above perks included).</i></p>
<p><i>$80 - a half-hour online concert with you as my audience (via Skype or FaceTime!) (+ all of the above perks included). </i></p>
<p><strong>WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>The most challenging part of being an independent artist is almost always finding tangible methods of funding. I understand that not everybody can financially contribute to this campaign, which is why it would still help me out a lot if you shared this campaign through social media &amp; by word of mouth!
