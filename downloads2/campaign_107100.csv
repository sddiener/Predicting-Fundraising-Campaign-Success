<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>My name is Megan Rach and I’m the co-owner of the brand new children’s entertainment company, Acorns &amp; Dewdrops. I’m a recent graduate at a performing arts high school with a musical theatre focus. I am currently a freelance model and film actor in the Twin Cities. Aria May, the tree fairy, is currently a children’s author and performer.</p>
<p>Acorns and Dewdrops is a comedic series about two fairies who discover a ‘magic box’ (cell phone) and, after an attempt to return the box to its owner goes haywire, find themselves trapped in the human world with no money, no magic, and no idea how to get home. Here they will meet a new friend that shows them how fairies are famous here! Can Aria and Miri survive as children’s stars?</p>
<p>After writing a full season (12 episodes) I’m finally confident enough to get this project off the ground!</p>
<p>This goal is made to cover costs of film equipment rental, cast payment, advertisement and distribution, and helping launch our combined etsy page.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The money we raise fund our equipment rental or company hire (depending on funds raised). We will be able to grow our company and push the duo on to new and exciting things! Our goal is to be able to have a full crew and guest appearances from our fellow fairies!</p>
<p>If we don’t reach our full goal, the money will go towards whatever we can for film equipment and the rest will be used to advertising and funding our Etsy shop: A&amp;D: Wings and Things! Creating new and exciting products made by fairies, for fairies! (and fairies at heart).</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Our project will create a fun, family-friendly, comedy that everyone will enjoy! Similar to Netflix original <i>Girlboss</i>, and Disney’s <i>Enchanted</i>, we find the perfect combination of laughter, friendship, and music! (There’s a musical episode written and composed and waiting to be shown to the world!)</p> <p>If anything, our project will bring a smile to your face, and isn’t that what really matters in the end?</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Currently there are some obstacles that can make this project more difficult. While funding is always an issue, filming itself and creating a following are a few things that can make or break our project. But that’s okay!</p>
<p>Being a film actor, I have multiple connections with local film companies and upcoming directors that are willing to help in any way they can! I also am the executive assistant of <i>Zenoscope Productions</i>, popular for their short <i>Cured </i>and their upcoming Sci-fi thriller, <i>Evergreen</i>. I have access to help, insight, and local, fairly priced connections! We also have experience in social media marketing that will help us build a large and continuous following!</p> <p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Even if you can't donate, we'd love your support! Here's how you can help: </p>
<p>We are in development on an Acorns and Dewdrops online store. Our store will go live on <strong>Etsy</strong> August 1st. We are seeking partners who can advertise our store on your site.</p>

My name is Jason and I’ve been involved with summer camps since 1992. From Camper to Counsellor to Program Director, summer camp has always been a huge part of my life! And as you can see below, I've always been a fan of the ringer tee. Combining my love of summer camp and obsession with the '80s, I created CAMP COWABUNGA to bring the spirit of summer camp and classic '80s television into the homes of the new generation of kids (and future campers)!!Set during the 1980's, CAMP COWABUNGA is a live-action series for kids that takes place at a summer camp (think PEE-WEE'S PLAYHOUSE meets CAMP CARIBOO) and features a host of fun and zany camp staff as well as lovable wilderness animal friends (in puppet form)!!WHY THE '80s?Because, like summer camp, it's a simpler time without modern technologies to distract us from learning and growing. At CAMP COWABUNGA, we connect with nature and others around us.The look of CAMP COWABUNGA will reflect the simple, softer, slightly grainy and older look of children's television shows from the 1980's. The show will feel like it was made in that decade.In each episode, viewers will get to experience what life is like as a camper at CAMP COWABUNGA! You'll go to different activities, hang out at the Dining Hall, tell jokes with new friends, and sing songs around the camp fire.Last year I noticed that my 3-year-old nephew was binge-watching a bunch of videos on YouTube that offered nothing of substance. They weren’t creative and they weren’t educational. I was then reminded of all the wonderful shows I used to watch as a kid in the ‘80s (YOU CAN’T DO THAT ON TELEVISION, MR. DRESSUP, PEE-WEE’S PLAYHOUSE, TODAY’S SPECIAL, CAMP CARIBOO, and SHARON, LOIS & BRAM'S ELEPHANT SHOW) and thought that kids today deserved something similar to these shows we grew up on. They need to have FUN while LEARNING!There are a TON of animated shows out there for kids today… and, for some reason, a serious lack of live-action, educational shows. Now, I LOVE animation… but there’s just something about a live-action show (with REAL people and actual PUPPETS you can touch) that is so special. It’s a real world of it’s own. It's a world that kids want to escape to. And that's why I've created CAMP COWABUNGA.Last fall we filmed the pilot episode of CAMP COWABUNGA on location. It gave us an idea as to what this show could be. There are additional characters (both people and puppets) that we hope to add to the show to help round it out and make the world even bigger.WATCH THE PILOT below… and SHARE IT with friends & family with children! SPREAD THE WORD!! And let us know what you think! Although this is a low-budget production, we can’t do this alone. The cast & crew for the pilot episode volunteered their time, we shot it using two iPhones, we called in all sorts of favours… and it still cost a significant amount of money to produce. For the remaining episodes, we want to make sure everyone involved is compensated for their time and talent.Every child deserves the right to experience summer camp at least once. This show aims to teach kids some of the lessons we learn when away at summer camp. By donating to our campaign, you’re helping educate children through entertainment!The TARGET AUDIENCE for CAMP COWABUNGA is kids 4-8 years old (but kids younger and older - and adults - love it too!).

Check out this video of them at Christmas when they received their very own CAMP COWABUNGA T-Shirts!

These are HIGH QUALITY Canadian-Made Puppets that are a BIG part of the show (and Flip needs some friends).
Cast & Crew: Our cast and crew volunteered on the pilot, so we’d like to pay them (at least a little bit) for their time and continued commitment to the project. And for the series, we'll be adding several more people to both the Cast and Crew.

Little do the friends know they are being followed and stalked by far more dangerous people than high school girls on Instagram.</p><h3><u><strong>THE MAIN CHARACTERS (The Fab Five) </strong></u></h3><p><strong>GENNY WITH A G</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508276467/tze6jipdkwymarluzrbk.png"" src=""""/></p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_eRzVqxRTqNCWohmeAr8-A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxFRnZpPRPA&amp;t=12s</a> (click here to watch Genny's Bachelor Audition) </p><p>( 21, barely legal): Genny is the leader of her eclectic group of friends, the “A Broad Squad”. She changed her name because she felt Jenny with a J was too basic. Genny was the product of a one night stand, no literally “one nightstand”. Her father worked for Ikea and came to her mother’s home to help her set up one nightstand. They ended up doing some kind of nailing, but not the kind you’d expect. Genny changes herself to connect with other people due to her absent connection with her father. This is how she discovered her knack for method acting. Genny is a “yes” girl through and through and a 100% people pleaser. She dreams of being a famous actress and, as Dylan calls it, she dreams of being Kylie Jenner Plus. </p><p>Follow Genny on Insta at: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/_gennywithag_/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/_gennywithag_/</a></p><p><strong>KEANDRA</strong> (23, Think KEKE PALMER): Keandra has placed a lot of pressure on herself to be a human rights lawyer. She’s constantly talking about all the cases she works (aka she shows up to jury duty every week). Much to the disappointment of one of our characters named Matt, Keandra only dates men who make six figures and are eights. When Matt protests that he’s actually pretty good looking, Keandra explains that she means “eights on the Enneagram scale”. Keandra loves to smash men because they are a metaphor for patriarchy (she makes men yell the names of powerful women while they do it). Keandra has successfully argued her way out of every parking/speeding ticket she’s ever been given.</p><p><strong>DYLAN CON UN “D”</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509475511/xbo5bs7eholoxd3odccv.png"" src=""""/></p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZR_EQ5gzc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZR_EQ5gzc</a> (click here to watch one of Dylan’s monologues from our script)</p><p>(22): Dylan is both gay and Latin, but his biggest struggle is that he always needs to be the center of attention (Genny with a G is his biggest competition despite the fact that they’re BFF’s). He's constantly talking about all the ""shows"" he ""books"" (aka every Thursday he sings ""Defying Gravity"" on karaoke at a shitty dive bar to some crack heads, and a crusty woman who wears shirt that says""single and ready to mingle""). His grandmother has no idea he’s gay even though he had his own quinceañera. As a dance major, he’s just now realizing he can’t get paid to grind up on drag queens in WeHo for the rest of his life.</p><p>Follow Dylan on Insta at: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/leggsbenedicked/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/leggsbenedicked/</a> (content coming soon!)</p><p><strong>GINA (pronounced va<i>gina</i>)</strong> (22, Think REBEL WILSON): Gina is the only one of the group who literally does not care what anyone thinks of her. Gina is lesbian, but she also sometimes identifies as Bob (something she struggles with throughout the arc of the first season). The only thing that holds her back from traveling the world is that she’ll have to pay for two airplane seats. Gina’s hobbies include getting high, going to Taco Bell, and having spiritual awakenings brought on by drugs. Gina has no idea what she wants to do with her life due to lack of guidance from her parents: her mother who lives for five o’ clock showings of <i>Jeopardy</i>, and her father who is actually just an urn of an ashes with a name tag that says “Hello My Name is Earl”. Gina’s friends are like the family she never had.</p><p><strong>MARISSA (RIS)</strong> (22, Think BRENDA SONG): Marissa is the grounded one of the group, and the only one with her head on straight, besides Keandra. Marissa has been in a committed relationship with her boyfriend from high school for eight years (minus the two month break where she took too many Jell-O shots and had a threesome in the school chapel). Marissa is the only one who isn’t going abroad, because she’s the only one who is employed post grad. She has a marketing job lined up, which she took due to extreme pressure (from herself) to pay back her student loans. She is constantly looking at her friend’s “abroad” social media posts and getting major FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out).</p><h3><u><strong>SUPPORTING CHARACTERS (they don’t support the main characters at all)</strong></u></h3><p><strong>JENNY WITH A J</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508276789/su3srsbqvji2um0rn5p7.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>(22): Jenny with a J is Genny with a G’s arch nemesis. She is never spotted without her band of loyal followers who all have J’s embroidered on their Cher from <i>Clueless </i>like uniforms. Jenny’s daddy owns the largest junk food drink franchise in the world and yet she still can’t seem to pay her assistant (aka unpaid intern) Amy. Throughout the season Jenny always appears with a different inbred, tiny dog, but Jenny always pretends it’s the same one: Princess Snuffleoffogas. It turns out Jenny has a very similar affliction to Lennie from <i>Of Mice Of Men</i> where she thinks each dog is so cute that she smooshes it to death. While they are “abroad” Jenny sees a good opportunity to befriend a sad Marissa and turn her against Genny with a G and the rest of the squad.</p><p><strong>DONNA (Genny’s Mom)</strong> (42, Think JANE KRAKOWSKI): Donna and Genny, although mother and daughter, are highly competitive. Donna resents Genny for finding her way into Donna’s womb and not letting Donna live out her dream of being an actress/super model/ soft core porn star. She also resents Genny for ruining her vagina, which was once ""as tight as a pinhole”. She has spent most of Genny’s child support money on boob jobs and ten dollar psychics. Donna constantly reminds Genny not to do drugs because one time she, “had a seven day iowaska trip during which she thought she found Jesus, who actually just ended up being 'Jesus', a homeless man with syphilis from the Ralph’s parking lot across the street. And while syphilis is curable the scars of bad decisions are not…” Throughout their journey Genny must fake that she is traveling the world over weekly FaceTime dates with Donna. Little does Genny know (until episode three) that Donna harbors a dark secret of her own.</p><h3><u>WHY US? </u></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508277017/lp3gkfhfbf3cym6kpnpa.jpg"" src=""""/></p><ul>

Often times when production companies purchase a series or a script, it sits on a shelf and is never made, but with the new digital platforms creators are breaking the rules of old Hollywood and developing hugely successful content. We don’t just want to be writers. We want a chance to produce and act in our series. We are the millennial Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. There is a huge shift towards digital content, and many series utilizing platforms such as Netflix, Hulu or Amazon are becoming hits without having to go through the highly competitive old school studio system.

Little do the friends know they are being followed and stalked by far more dangerous people than high school girls on Instagram.THE MAIN CHARACTERS (The Fab Five) GENNY WITH A Ghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxFRnZpPRPA&t=12s (click here to watch Genny's Bachelor Audition) ( 21, barely legal): Genny is the leader of her eclectic group of friends, the “A Broad Squad”. She changed her name because she felt Jenny with a J was too basic. Genny was the product of a one night stand, no literally “one nightstand”. Her father worked for Ikea and came to her mother’s home to help her set up one nightstand. They ended up doing some kind of nailing, but not the kind you’d expect. Genny changes herself to connect with other people due to her absent connection with her father. This is how she discovered her knack for method acting. Genny is a “yes” girl through and through and a 100% people pleaser. She dreams of being a famous actress and, as Dylan calls it, she dreams of being Kylie Jenner Plus. Follow Genny on Insta at: https://www.instagram.com/_gennywithag_/KEANDRA (23, Think KEKE PALMER): Keandra has placed a lot of pressure on herself to be a human rights lawyer. She’s constantly talking about all the cases she works (aka she shows up to jury duty every week). Much to the disappointment of one of our characters named Matt, Keandra only dates men who make six figures and are eights. When Matt protests that he’s actually pretty good looking, Keandra explains that she means “eights on the Enneagram scale”. Keandra loves to smash men because they are a metaphor for patriarchy (she makes men yell the names of powerful women while they do it). Keandra has successfully argued her way out of every parking/speeding ticket she’s ever been given.DYLAN CON UN “D”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtZR_EQ5gzc (click here to watch one of Dylan’s monologues from our script)(22): Dylan is both gay and Latin, but his biggest struggle is that he always needs to be the center of attention (Genny with a G is his biggest competition despite the fact that they’re BFF’s). He's constantly talking about all the ""shows"" he ""books"" (aka every Thursday he sings ""Defying Gravity"" on karaoke at a shitty dive bar to some crack heads, and a crusty woman who wears shirt that says""single and ready to mingle""). His grandmother has no idea he’s gay even though he had his own quinceañera. As a dance major, he’s just now realizing he can’t get paid to grind up on drag queens in WeHo for the rest of his life.Follow Dylan on Insta at: https://www.instagram.com/leggsbenedicked/ (content coming soon!)GINA (pronounced vagina) (22, Think REBEL WILSON): Gina is the only one of the group who literally does not care what anyone thinks of her. Gina is lesbian, but she also sometimes identifies as Bob (something she struggles with throughout the arc of the first season). The only thing that holds her back from traveling the world is that she’ll have to pay for two airplane seats. Gina’s hobbies include getting high, going to Taco Bell, and having spiritual awakenings brought on by drugs. Gina has no idea what she wants to do with her life due to lack of guidance from her parents: her mother who lives for five o’ clock showings of Jeopardy, and her father who is actually just an urn of an ashes with a name tag that says “Hello My Name is Earl”. Gina’s friends are like the family she never had.MARISSA (RIS) (22, Think BRENDA SONG): Marissa is the grounded one of the group, and the only one with her head on straight, besides Keandra. Marissa has been in a committed relationship with her boyfriend from high school for eight years (minus the two month break where she took too many Jell-O shots and had a threesome in the school chapel). Marissa is the only one who isn’t going abroad, because she’s the only one who is employed post grad. She has a marketing job lined up, which she took due to extreme pressure (from herself) to pay back her student loans. She is constantly looking at her friend’s “abroad” social media posts and getting major FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out).SUPPORTING CHARACTERS (they don’t support the main characters at all)JENNY WITH A J(22): Jenny with a J is Genny with a G’s arch nemesis. She is never spotted without her band of loyal followers who all have J’s embroidered on their Cher from Clueless like uniforms. Jenny’s daddy owns the largest junk food drink franchise in the world and yet she still can’t seem to pay her assistant (aka unpaid intern) Amy. Throughout the season Jenny always appears with a different inbred, tiny dog, but Jenny always pretends it’s the same one: Princess Snuffleoffogas. It turns out Jenny has a very similar affliction to Lennie from Of Mice Of Men where she thinks each dog is so cute that she smooshes it to death. While they are “abroad” Jenny sees a good opportunity to befriend a sad Marissa and turn her against Genny with a G and the rest of the squad.DONNA (Genny’s Mom) (42, Think JANE KRAKOWSKI): Donna and Genny, although mother and daughter, are highly competitive. Donna resents Genny for finding her way into Donna’s womb and not letting Donna live out her dream of being an actress/super model/ soft core porn star. She also resents Genny for ruining her vagina, which was once ""as tight as a pinhole”. She has spent most of Genny’s child support money on boob jobs and ten dollar psychics. Donna constantly reminds Genny not to do drugs because one time she, “had a seven day iowaska trip during which she thought she found Jesus, who actually just ended up being 'Jesus', a homeless man with syphilis from the Ralph’s parking lot across the street. And while syphilis is curable the scars of bad decisions are not…” Throughout their journey Genny must fake that she is traveling the world over weekly FaceTime dates with Donna. Little does Genny know (until episode three) that Donna harbors a dark secret of her own.WHY US? 
We grew up in this world: faking our lives through the facade of social media.
Female factor: Hollywood still lacks strong female producers, directors, writers and a female voice, but it is looking to fill that void. 
Unique competitive advantage: we’ve already started to put our content on social media through The Eskimo Sisters’ social accounts.
WHY NOW?
Social media component: Relevant now as it's constantly changing. We also tie social media into our series in a very creative way (we don't want to reveal too much).
Diverse characters: There is a great desire now more than ever to showcase diverse voices and characters from different backgrounds and perspectives and this is something we care about. 
Abroad/ ""find yourself"" component: chasing the millennial dream of ""happiness"".
WHY THIS IDEA? Because we’re all sick of going to dinner and talking to someone looking down a screen. Because social media causes anxiety and depression and we want to expose what a facade it is.HIT SHOWS/ MOVIES SIMILAR IN TONE 
Girls
Broad City 
The Hangover 
House Bunny 
Sex in the City
But What Do We Have that They Don't?
Social media/self promotion component 
More diversity 
“Abroad” component
 A hook and engine (new social media post each week) 
Strong millennial feedback on our content
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS OURSELVES?As we state in our video, we are doing this ourselves because the Hollywood senior execs who have mentored us have encouraged us to do so. Often times when production companies purchase a series or a script, it sits on a shelf and is never made, but with the new digital platforms creators are breaking the rules of old Hollywood and developing hugely successful content. We don’t just want to be writers. We want a chance to produce and act in our series. We are the millennial Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. There is a huge shift towards digital content, and many series utilizing platforms such as Netflix, Hulu or Amazon are becoming hits without having to go through the highly competitive old school studio system. Below are two charts that can help you better to understand our thinking. Hit Shows That Began as Digital Series 

 Broad City (YouTube → Comedy Central) 

 Workaholics (YouTube → Comedy Central) 

 Whatever, Linda (YouTube → Vimeo → TV)

 Insecure (YouTube → HBO)
WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING?Above you can see exactly where the money is going. We want to raise $35,000 because Indiegogo takes a cut, and there are always extra travel, equipment, and insurance expenses that we may not foresee (something we experienced with our last project)!OUR DIGITSIf you have any questions please contact us at one of the email addresses listed below. Kendall: Kendall.milton@gmail.comLily: Lily@lilydrew.comNOTE: If you donate a certain amount, but prefer to receive a perk designated to a lower donation amount that is definitely an option, just let us know!",7.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>I've been writing since the age of 8. It started with song lyrics, then the dreaded essays for high school and college courses, then came my first book, a memoir titled <i>Not That Girl: A Tell-All Memoir</i>. After the release of my book which documents my struggles with abuse, heartache, and chasing my dream of becoming an actress while being a single mother, I knew that my story would one day become a television show.</p>
<p>I moved to Atlanta to pursue my dream of being an actress in July 2016 at the age of 26. With less than $800 to my name, my son and I started a new life in Georgia. A short while after being in Georgia, I found myself, unemployed, and emotionally broken. I applied to tons of jobs and nothing seemed to work out. I can't remember the exact day or time, but I felt God telling me to create my own series. I have always been one to go full-speed ahead when I believe in my vision and that is exactly what I did. In a little over three weeks, I had written my first draft of all eight of the Season One episodes. It hasn't been easy, but knowing that my son gets to see me pursue my dream that can give us a better life, despite the hardships,  and giving others the opportunity to pursue their dreams, makes me fight everyday to make Living Vee a success. The nights of no sleep and non stop work, the time my son has had to sacrifice playtime and cuddle time with me, the tears I have shed throughout this process, will all be worth it. Living Vee will relate to so many people and I cannot wait to see where God takes the Cast and Crew of Living Vee. In spite of everything, I have hope and I truly believe that there's nowhere to go but up from where I am. </p>
<p>On January 16, 2016 at 2:30am, I made a list of BIG entertainment goals. I was actually writing goals that I never thought would be obtainable but they sounded awesome. Number 20 on that list was ""Have my own show and be the Director."" A year and a half later, here I as the head of Living Vee.</p>

<h3 align=""center""><strong>About Us</strong></h3>
<p>This is it. After three seasons of our web series, we’re calling this the end of an era. This is the Final Season of MANBEAST. It only took us half-a-dozen years. But, we're here now for one more epic run and we need you!</p>
<p>My name is Brandon Aquino and I'm the creator of MANBEAST. I’m an aspiring comedy writer and director edging towards my big break in film and entertainment. Being the creator requires… uh, creativity? While my education in film has taught me the principles of the art, I push the boundaries and break the rules in my work. They're really just guidelines, if you ask me.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>How This Came About</strong></h3>
<p>The idea for MANBEAST sprouted many years ago between friends just talking about a buncha bullshit. I thought it would be a fun idea to make a show about our misadventures. From there, who would have guessed that our blunders would still be funny enough to write about and capture it on film. We’ve been very fortunate that many continue to find the humor, ironically, in our misfortunes after all these years.</p>
<p>With the help of a handful of people, we have been able to produce 15 episodes of MANBEAST. Each season shows more evolution in the writing, editing, acting, lighting - basically everything associated with the film making process has improved.

</div></div>","About Us
This is it. After three seasons of our web series, we’re calling this the end of an era. This is the Final Season of MANBEAST. It only took us half-a-dozen years. But, we're here now for one more epic run and we need you!
My name is Brandon Aquino and I'm the creator of MANBEAST. I’m an aspiring comedy writer and director edging towards my big break in film and entertainment. Being the creator requires… uh, creativity? While my education in film has taught me the principles of the art, I push the boundaries and break the rules in my work. They're really just guidelines, if you ask me.
 
How This Came About
The idea for MANBEAST sprouted many years ago between friends just talking about a buncha bullshit. I thought it would be a fun idea to make a show about our misadventures. From there, who would have guessed that our blunders would still be funny enough to write about and capture it on film. We’ve been very fortunate that many continue to find the humor, ironically, in our misfortunes after all these years.
With the help of a handful of people, we have been able to produce 15 episodes of MANBEAST. Each season shows more evolution in the writing, editing, acting, lighting - basically everything associated with the film making process has improved. Now, with the final season at hand, I believe this will be our swan song. A truly perfect farewell season that will launch the ultimate writing gig in television. We’ve already started writing the season and everything is going to end in a climactic twist. Dun dun dunnnn. I promise everything isn't a dream. No Jacob's Ladder shit here.
We’re asking you, for the final time, to support us with our last season. With your contribution, you can help us get the recognition by our fellow writers and the film community. We want more viewers, more film festival nominations, and of course, awards. Thanks!
 
What We Need & What You Get
Let me break it down for you and tell you where your money goes:
This season, we are aiming high because this project deserves it. With your support, let’s get to $5,000. The money will go towards a few areas. Take a look at my professional-looking graph I made to help you visualize our goal. It’s really a piece of pie to understand.

<p>The sex positive movement has been fantastic and empowering for women who choose to have sex and has even been suggested to be a potential factor for why millennials are choosing to say ‘no’ to sex.

<p>Contemporary stories that relate to the doe-eyed in-betweeners navigating adulthood blind and seeking love without sex, haven't existed in the media landscape. Your contributions, big and small, will go a long way towards helping us tell more of these stories and bringing them to bigger and wider screens around the world. </p>

<h3><strong>“They will pay… with rivers of blood!”</strong></h3>
<p>It may sound corny now, but if you grew up in the early 80s, those words turned every broomstick into a lethal katana. Martial Arts films dominated the American imagination, and kids everywhere devoured the canon. Many were lost to time. But one staple, one classic of the genre, kicks the most ass: Shogun Assassin. The bloodiest of them all. In humble tribute to Shogun Assassin, we warmly present <strong>WOLF</strong>, an original web series.</p>
<p>Set in present-day Las Vegas, <strong>WOLF</strong>, follows Judah <strong>WOLF</strong>, a dishonored ex-cop, searching the streets of Las Vegas with his 7-year-old daughter, Kikuyu <strong>WOLF</strong>, seeking bloody revenge on Korando Shinoda, the Yakuza boss responsible for his wife’s murder.</p>
<p>We, the producers of <strong>WOLF</strong>, want to offer a new generation a tale of revenge, loyalty, and honor. But we need bloodthirsty heroes to help!</p>
<p>We are raising $250,000 to create the highest quality web series.  You have watched the sizzle. That is just a taste of what the nine-episode series will be. Your awesome donations will go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nine quality episodes: 10-12 minutes each.</li>
<li>SAG Cast</li>
<li>Film Equipment</li>
<li>Set Design</li>

<p>WOLF presents and represents a healthy American tapestry. And we welcome everyone to contribute to this series. Your love and support means more than written words can express.  </p>

<h3>The Team</h3>
<p><strong>Sean Jackson - Writer/Director</strong></p>

<p><strong>Kiki Knowles - Producer</strong></p>
<p>Native Detroiter, KiKi Knowles is an independent film producer, who made her debut producing the web series sizzle <i>Wolf</i> directed by Sean Jackson. KiKi was first introduced to the industry as a child performing in stage productions across the Detroit Metropolitan Area. Her early training and background groomed her for the position to later serve as a manager for two of her children for several years propelling her into the film industry. </p>
<p>In addition to film, KiKi enjoys writing poetry and is set to release her first published work of art this year. She is a devoted wife and mother of 3 who loves to travel and has a passion for working with underprivileged children. Paying homage to her Detroit roots, KiKi and her spouse are currently working to create a group home for children and veterans in the heart of the city.</p>
<p><strong>Kathleen Shinn - Producer</strong></p>
<p>Kathleen Shinn has had an interest in fine art since high school, she enjoys working with all mediums including collage, acrylics and clay. In college she continued her love of fine art but her area of concentration was in healthcare. Equipped with her artistic capabilities and knowledge in nursing, Shinn was exposed to filmmaking as a set nurse/EMT and with that exposure, a new passion took over. With an interest in film and a background in Healthcare, she developed an interest in special effects makeup. Working with these skills she served as a special effects artist on films “Sweet Ninja Brown” and “Territory 8”. Her love of filmmaking grew over the next several years working alongside writer/director Sean Jackson. She has produced several short films such as “It’s Karma, Baby,” “Dying to Tell You,” “Sweet Ninja Brown,” “House Rules,” “The Nowheres,” “The Bay Laurel,” and feature film “Bubblegum &amp; Broken Fingers.” Shinn is writing her first screenplay and directed her first short film “Unintended”.<br/> </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>I, Roberta, want the impact of this show to be something you cannot wait to BINGE! I'll take a not often seen deep dive into ""toxic masculinity"". I believe that without vulnerable loving action you are left with half the story! Dr. Detox will have some comedic moments, but it is about real issues we face on the daily. The show will answer these sometimes catastrophic questions with laughter, and honesty: How do we as a community support men during the hardest times in their lives without eviscerating them? How do men &amp; women see themselves and support each other when their worlds are falling apart? How do we laugh at ourselves, and also get the help we need? <strong>No dragging allowed</strong>.</li>

</div></div>","Short Summary

Roberta, writer/director, has been in the film industry for over 25 years: programming film festivals, writing ""the bible"" for short filmmakers ""How To Make A Short Film: Secrets From A Sundance Programmer, and directing and producing over 50 film projects and TV pilots.
We are raising a modest amount of money to cover a 3 day production, focusing on keeping the number of locations, and characters manageable, and the STORY value high. We are creating a project that ensures you realize just how much this issue matters to you. We all want the space to laugh at ourselves and address the issues: Judgment suffocates growth.
Your contribution will support an exceptionally well crafted work, made by mostly women of color who believe in our collective ability to transform the pain and suffering we live with into a bright, funny, insightful story of real transformation. Women falter, men falter, and we owe it to ourselves to create a  bridge that leads to loving action with a drive to create real community. Your support means everything and Dr. Detox is a dream come true for this team!

<li>Professional grade production equipment rental (cameras, lighting, audio)</li>
<li>Costuming</li>
<li>Prop creation...Including a full-sized police box.</li>
<li>Original music score</li>

<p>As a part of this relaunch, The Beer Dabbler is kickstarting a brand new video department with a commitment of bringing our viewers exclusive video content that showcases all that the Midwest’s vibrant craft beer scene has to offer.

<p>Hello! I'm Lyralen Kaye and I want to tell you a little about Assigned Female at Birth, A Web Series about Some Bodies.</p>
<p>First, we've won best web series/new media in 6 film festivals since January of 2021!</p>
<p>We have thousands of views on YouTube.</p>
<p>In order to help this happen when we had a shortfall, Teddy Howland offered us matching funds in November of 2020. We hit our original goal of $1500 and went on to raise $4000 more to fund Season 2.</p>
<p>Season 3 is now in preproduction with an on line reading of the script scheduled for August 1. And for the first time, we will be incorporating higher end cameras and in-person shoots.</p>
<p>How did we do the series in the pandemic? The series itself was born out of our need to tell stories while keeping 100% safe about our health, AFAB necessitated a journey through cyber space into the hearts and minds of people across the United States, Canada, the UK, Australia and Mexico. We filmed everything remotely on smart phones with actors in their own homes and crew on zoom for 2 seasons.</p>
<p>The first two seasons were based on 32 interviews (I've now done 50+) with people who have been taught from birth that their bodies can never be good enough. Not able enough, not straight enough, not cis enough, not thin enough, not white enough, not gay enough, not femme enough, not butch enough, not young enough...the list goes on. All feel invisible—from the gender fluid Asian lesbian born with a fibular hemimelia disability to the blind ballet dancer, from the women fighting clinical depression to the rabbi on the spectrum who is also a cancer survivor, from the preschool teacher to the non-binary person with multiple personalities—they struggle to be seen. And whether the prejudice they fight is ableism or racism, homophobia or misogyny, whether they seek healing from #metoo issues, prejudice or disabilities they’ve had since birth, they reach for life with courage. They are bold, frightened , vulnerable and ridiculously strong.</p>
<p>They are, above all things, woke.</p>
<p>They are my people, my community, the only place I call home...and I want them to be that place for you too, no matter your gender or orientation, your ability or your age.</p>
<p>For too long, these stories have not been not heard anywhere in the mainstream, and besides the oppression that implies, it is a terrible loss, because having an outlier identity means you have to unpack what it means to be human in order to both survive and thrive. And then you have so much to teach, and so many ways to laugh at the absurdity and the pain of being human.</p>
<p>We are in a crucial time in history. Art and stories hold us to empathy, to a growing understanding, to an ability to connect.</p>
<p>This is a world changing project, and we want you to be part of it.</p>
<p>We also want to move beyond our first 2 seasons into a deeper ongoing examination of these lives, and to pay cast and crew equally, according to SAG-AFTRA guidelines, moving forward.</p>
<p>We believe this is crucially important.</p>
<p>Why? Because this project represents unheard voices telling human stories of struggling to accept the bodies in which they live...a struggle we all have in this culture. Because loving our bodies is a way to love the earth, to find peace...and art inspires empathy, compassion, passion, commitment to the core issues of our lives in a way political rhetoric approximates.</p>
<p>It's important because we, those of us creating this project, those of us interviewed for this project, are among the most at risk. It's important because telling our stories is a way to overcome our fear of being hurt and in doing so to love the world and offer connection to our communities.</p>
<p>It's important because we've been trolled on FB and YouTube since the very first day, and we want to sing against that hate.</p>
<p>It's important because you are part of this, and we are one world and one people.</p>

<p>I'm a push-the-envelope person, so as the writing moved along, I started asking directors of photography if we could film remotely and still create the illusion that characters were relating in the same world.

</div></div>","Hello! I'm Lyralen Kaye and I want to tell you a little about Assigned Female at Birth, A Web Series about Some Bodies.
First, we've won best web series/new media in 6 film festivals since January of 2021!
We have thousands of views on YouTube.
In order to help this happen when we had a shortfall, Teddy Howland offered us matching funds in November of 2020. We hit our original goal of $1500 and went on to raise $4000 more to fund Season 2.
Season 3 is now in preproduction with an on line reading of the script scheduled for August 1. And for the first time, we will be incorporating higher end cameras and in-person shoots.
How did we do the series in the pandemic? The series itself was born out of our need to tell stories while keeping 100% safe about our health, AFAB necessitated a journey through cyber space into the hearts and minds of people across the United States, Canada, the UK, Australia and Mexico. We filmed everything remotely on smart phones with actors in their own homes and crew on zoom for 2 seasons.
The first two seasons were based on 32 interviews (I've now done 50+) with people who have been taught from birth that their bodies can never be good enough. Not able enough, not straight enough, not cis enough, not thin enough, not white enough, not gay enough, not femme enough, not butch enough, not young enough...the list goes on. All feel invisible—from the gender fluid Asian lesbian born with a fibular hemimelia disability to the blind ballet dancer, from the women fighting clinical depression to the rabbi on the spectrum who is also a cancer survivor, from the preschool teacher to the non-binary person with multiple personalities—they struggle to be seen. And whether the prejudice they fight is ableism or racism, homophobia or misogyny, whether they seek healing from #metoo issues, prejudice or disabilities they’ve had since birth, they reach for life with courage. They are bold, frightened , vulnerable and ridiculously strong.
They are, above all things, woke.
They are my people, my community, the only place I call home...and I want them to be that place for you too, no matter your gender or orientation, your ability or your age.
For too long, these stories have not been not heard anywhere in the mainstream, and besides the oppression that implies, it is a terrible loss, because having an outlier identity means you have to unpack what it means to be human in order to both survive and thrive. And then you have so much to teach, and so many ways to laugh at the absurdity and the pain of being human.
We are in a crucial time in history. Art and stories hold us to empathy, to a growing understanding, to an ability to connect.
This is a world changing project, and we want you to be part of it.
We also want to move beyond our first 2 seasons into a deeper ongoing examination of these lives, and to pay cast and crew equally, according to SAG-AFTRA guidelines, moving forward.
We believe this is crucially important.
Why? Because this project represents unheard voices telling human stories of struggling to accept the bodies in which they live...a struggle we all have in this culture.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>It all begins with a legend, the Legend of the 46 Norman soldiers that with the help of Saint George killed 3000 Arabs in a single night in 1063. After that fateful night, Sicily became an easy conquest for the military forces of France. A fight between two great religions that brings back the conflict to our present days.</p>
<p>From this legend, this new Thermopylae, a new hero is born in Cerami: Serlon The Warlord!<br/>The French are more than happy at the court of Jerax, in the heart of Sicily, and celebrating.</p>

<p>It doesn’t take long for the infidels to be banished from the island. Benavert, emir of Syracuse, the last to fall, plotted against the Normans by sending Prince Ibrahim asking for armistice.</p>

<h3>HELLO</h3>
<p>Tony Tambi, Constance Ejuma and Bambadjan Bamba are the production team behind Con$equences; a web series that follows the lives of culturally diverse con artists. However, unlike other similarly themed shows, this one is anchored by reformed <i>Yahoo Boys</i> (think “Nigerian Prince” type email scams).</p>
<p>Most of us have either heard about or received solicitations from scammers like the <i>Yahoo Boys,</i> so as characters they are well known and intriguing, but never fully explored on TV, movies or in a web series. We want to change that, not only because it provides a different perspective of the immigrant experience in the US, but also because it makes for great storytelling!</p>
<p>Needless to say Con$equences isn’t just a web series about reformed con artists, it deals with familiar themes like love, friendship, betrayal, revenge, family and cultural identity.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey there, I'm Saycsar Fleurima (as many of you already know). I am working on this romantic thriller mini-series. We are currently recording our pilot and will update on here but this summer we would like to film and distribute the rest of this mini-series (around 8-10 episodes). With your help, you can springboard the career for a very talented group of SF Bay Area based young artists as well as be a part of the series yourself. Fiscal donations are not the only way you can help but even a dollar means a lot to us! We love volunteers/extras, locations, permission for locations/borrowing props and/or costumes, </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><u>Production Costs:</u></p>
<p>- supplies for building sets and props, </p>
<p>- insurance</p>
<p>- travel</p>
<p>- pay for actors and crew</p>
<p><u>Distribution:</u></p>
<p>- entrance fee for festivals</p>
<p>- set up for the soundtrack concert/premiere</p>
<p>- screening at local theaters</p>
<p>- DVD/Digital Copy</p>
<p>- rights for music and images</p>
<p><u>BY HELPING:</u></p>
<p>You may be listed as a producer, have a role as an extra, be a part of a series behind the scenes, receive tickets to the premiere and concert and a copy for yourself and other perks (T-Shirt, autograph poster, etc)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The cast and I are all a talented group of men and women from all kinds of background who are hoping that you can help springboard careers and support challenging, vibrant, unique art from SF Bay Area artists. I am in school for filmmaking but have been practicing my craft for close to ten years, rarely seeing myself do something else. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are hoping to make this as streamlined as possible but given the nature of the craft, we may not be able to stick to deadlines but we are of our word and will take that time to present something of quality. I'd rather have a project be delayed but done impeccably then presenting something half baked on time. We value transparency and will keep you up to date. We want to make this production a family affair! </p>
<p>As well, we may go over budget but hoping we don't. I am very confident in the ability of all of us and we will be able to make the difference. By helping out, you are opening the door for grander projects in the future - such as my next project a feature film. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the Word!</p>
<p>donate your volunteer time or a location/costumes/props! </p>
<p>Even a dollar is appreciated</p>

Stranger Magic is a production company founded by dear friends Yumna Khan and Nida Chowdhry. We make shows that capture the magic of everyday people around us.
We aim to create diverse, high-quality entertainment - think shows you'd watch on Netflix or HBO. We're not waiting for the shows we want to see - we're making them ourselves.  If the unflattering characters of Arrested Development met the visual style of Aziz Ansari's Master of None, you'd have Unfair & Ugly. We're making a show that feels real to us, full of complex human characters, each with their own sense of humor and challenges. The main storylines deal with love, careers, and generation gaps. Layered into the show are subjects like depression, racism, and gender bias.Our title Unfair & Ugly is a play on the skin whitening cream Fair & Lovely (yeah, that's a thing, and it's a $10 billion industry). We're told we aren't acceptable the way that we are. We have to change and hide who we are, and present these one-dimensional ""positive"" images of ourselves in response to the destructive narrative about us. Well, Unfair & Ugly isn't whitewashed. It's raw, real, and deeply human. It explores both the beautiful and less flattering aspects of our cultures through our own eyes. We don't need to be fair-skinned to be lovely, and we don't need to be saints or terrorists to be represented in the media.

<p>Delia and Giulia both work at the same comedy club in New York City, without really knowing each other. While Giulia has been working there as a waitress for a long time and is frustrated by it, Delia is new to the club as a performer and is excited about the chance to pursue her dream. Although their paths haven’t crossed yet, they seem to be unknowingly connected.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Let's talk about... </strong></i>Did you think we were gonna say sex? Not this time, baby! (JK, we have a love story in there, too). However, in the pilot episode we specifically wanted to talk about two current social issues:<i> The complexity of the US immigration process</i> and how difficult and soul-crushing it really can be to go through it; And <i>the growing epidemic that is perfectionism</i>. As a result of this unsatisfiable desire to be perfect, studies have shown that 19% of the millennial generation are suffering from depression – a lot more than previous generations. We want to shine a light on what it feels like to constantly combat socially prescribed perfectionism and why that makes it so hard to get your sh** together sometimes. And beyond that, how unintentionally funny a personal tragedy can be and how relatable irresponsible decisions are. It's comedy after all (haha; lol).</p>

<p>Craig is a New York based filmmaker with more than 10 years experience in the industry. Which means that besides having studied film production on both undergraduate and graduate levels at the University of Central Florida, he's done impressive things than we can fit into this sentence. New sentence: He's directed 6 films, earning him a total of 18 domestic and international awards; he's worked with industry brand names such as Lin Manuel Miranda, DJ Funkmaster Flex and Kenan Thompson; he's one of the keenest postproduction specialists in NYC; his first feature film The Drifter has been acquired by distributor Terror Films for worldwide digital release. Now he's directing Critically Ashamed and it honestly feels like the captain of the football team asked us to go to prom with him!</p>

<p>Ultimately, we want to turn Critically Ashamed into a full series. But for now, we are shooting our pilot episode, which we'll release as a 4-part mini series online (""High Maintenance"" style). Our goal is to deliver a show to our beloved audience (That's you! Hi! How you doin'?) that looks, feels, sounds like your favorite Netflix shows. Now you might wonder how we plan to accomplish that with only 10k. Here's how: Thanks to passionate supporters of our series we already have access to essential equipment (camera, lights, sound), some amazing locations, and stellar film professionals on board. So we just need a little more help from you, our beloved audience, to complete this project! So <strong>JOIN US!</strong></p>

<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $10.000 in 45 days. These funds will go towards more equipment and locations, insurance, cast and crew expenses, etc. If you're not a fan of words (boring and outdated am I rite) here's our budget breakdown in a pie chart for visual reference.</p>

<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The perks are to your right. You already figured that out, because you're smart. What you don't know yet is that every week we'll raffle off a special prize among every contributor. Prizes include: A pair of Critically Ashamed star Dominick Perrier's signed undies, a headshot session with our director Craig Calamis, a personalized roast from Usama Siddiquee and much more!</p>
<p><strong>If We Exceed Our Goal</strong></p>
<p>If we raise more than our initial goal, funds will go towards shooting additional scenes, festival submission fees, as well as getting the series out to a larger audience.</p>
<p><strong>If We Don't Reach Our Full Goal</strong></p>
<p>The support we have received so far for this project has been overwhelmingly positive, and because of that we have already been able to accomplish so much with -let's be real- so little. But hey, that's why we crowdfund, right? We are very confident we will reach our goal, and hopeful that we can go beyond that... In which case the sky is the limit! However, being the scrappy hard-working New Yorkers that we are, we are ready to shoot no matter what. We want this to be F***ING amazing. And it will be. We just don't wanna go Critically in Debt in doing so. </p>

Underneath the tough facade is a vulnerable woman, desperately wanting to connect to people, especially Jayme, who she's fallen for hard. But she's struggling to commit fully, not knowing how much time she has left in the country. As long her immigration status is pending, she's living a temporary life and that doesn't allow permanent connections.</p>

She’s always wanted to be an actress and has been in the city for five years, without much luck. She is funny and quick witted, but behind all that lies a big pile of insecurities. She has a big crush on her co-worker Josh, but is too shy to act on it. Her bedroom reflects what a nostalgic person she is, with lots of pictures and memorabilia from her childhood, especially high school which she considers to be her glory days.</p>

**Super Sexy Plot Summary**
Delia and Giulia both work at the same comedy club in New York City, without really knowing each other. While Giulia has been working there as a waitress for a long time and is frustrated by it, Delia is new to the club as a performer and is excited about the chance to pursue her dream. Although their paths haven’t crossed yet, they seem to be unknowingly connected.
 
Let's talk about... Did you think we were gonna say sex? Not this time, baby! (JK, we have a love story in there, too). However, in the pilot episode we specifically wanted to talk about two current social issues: The complexity of the US immigration process and how difficult and soul-crushing it really can be to go through it; And the growing epidemic that is perfectionism. As a result of this unsatisfiable desire to be perfect, studies have shown that 19% of the millennial generation are suffering from depression – a lot more than previous generations. We want to shine a light on what it feels like to constantly combat socially prescribed perfectionism and why that makes it so hard to get your sh** together sometimes. And beyond that, how unintentionally funny a personal tragedy can be and how relatable irresponsible decisions are. It's comedy after all (haha; lol).
Have you already seen everything on Netflix?! Yes? Then it's time to take a look at this!
  
Please allow us to introduce ourselves...
Hey guys! I'm Franca, your friendly alien of extraordinary ability (Yes, that is my legal status). Despite my 10 year career as a performer, it still took me a year to get my artist visa application approved. While the petition was pending, I couldn't leave the country and after my work permit expired I had to rely on friends and family to help me.. not die. When it was all over, and I realized therapy was too expensive, I wrote a screenplay based partially on my immigration struggle.
Ciao belli! This is Giuditta. For the longest time I was sure I had come up with the term ""quarter life crisis"" and to be honest I still claim it as mine as much as possible. Moving to the city at 25 after extensive theatre training and working in the field, I thought I had it made. I didn't. Crisis doesn't even begin I describe it. Coming from a high achieving scientist family in Italy while you still wait tables and try to confidently proclaim that ""I'm an actor"" takes a special kind of courage. And we all know how much courage it takes in New York. Art imitates life in hilariously tragic ways-this is my way. ​
 
THE DIRECTOR
Craig is a New York based filmmaker with more than 10 years experience in the industry. Which means that besides having studied film production on both undergraduate and graduate levels at the University of Central Florida, he's done impressive things than we can fit into this sentence. New sentence: He's directed 6 films, earning him a total of 18 domestic and international awards; he's worked with industry brand names such as Lin Manuel Miranda, DJ Funkmaster Flex and Kenan Thompson; he's one of the keenest postproduction specialists in NYC; his first feature film The Drifter has been acquired by distributor Terror Films for worldwide digital release. Now he's directing Critically Ashamed and it honestly feels like the captain of the football team asked us to go to prom with him!
 

Ultimately, we want to turn Critically Ashamed into a full series. But for now, we are shooting our pilot episode, which we'll release as a 4-part mini series online (""High Maintenance"" style). Our goal is to deliver a show to our beloved audience (That's you! Hi! How you doin'?) that looks, feels, sounds like your favorite Netflix shows. Now you might wonder how we plan to accomplish that with only 10k. Here's how: Thanks to passionate supporters of our series we already have access to essential equipment (camera, lights, sound), some amazing locations, and stellar film professionals on board. So we just need a little more help from you, our beloved audience, to complete this project! So JOIN US!



What We Need
Our goal is to raise $10.000 in 45 days. These funds will go towards more equipment and locations, insurance, cast and crew expenses, etc. If you're not a fan of words (boring and outdated am I rite) here's our budget breakdown in a pie chart for visual reference.

 
What You Get
The perks are to your right. You already figured that out, because you're smart. What you don't know yet is that every week we'll raffle off a special prize among every contributor. Prizes include: A pair of Critically Ashamed star Dominick Perrier's signed undies, a headshot session with our director Craig Calamis, a personalized roast from Usama Siddiquee and much more!
If We Exceed Our Goal
If we raise more than our initial goal, funds will go towards shooting additional scenes, festival submission fees, as well as getting the series out to a larger audience.
If We Don't Reach Our Full Goal
The support we have received so far for this project has been overwhelmingly positive, and because of that we have already been able to accomplish so much with -let's be real- so little. But hey, that's why we crowdfund, right? We are very confident we will reach our goal, and hopeful that we can go beyond that... In which case the sky is the limit! However, being the scrappy hard-working New Yorkers that we are, we are ready to shoot no matter what. We want this to be F***ING amazing. And it will be. We just don't wanna go Critically in Debt in doing so. 

 

We understand not everyone can contribute financially and are so grateful for any assistance you can give to spread the word. A tweet, a text, a blog item, a Facebook or Instagram post, anything you can do to share our campaign with your networks will be immeasurably helpful in helping us reach our goal. Share this campaign, share our videos, share our posts, share anything that isn't nailed to the floor!

Delia played by Franca Paschen
A stand up comedienne from Germany. Fiercely independent and a lovable dreamer at heart. She came to NYC on a student visa and is now in the process of applying for an artist one. Underneath the tough facade is a vulnerable woman, desperately wanting to connect to people, especially Jayme, who she's fallen for hard. But she's struggling to commit fully, not knowing how much time she has left in the country. As long her immigration status is pending, she's living a temporary life and that doesn't allow permanent connections.
 

Giulia played by Giuditta Lattanzi
Born and raised in Baltimore to Italian parents. Her Italian is on point but even when she speaks English, it’s rapid fire. She’s always wanted to be an actress and has been in the city for five years, without much luck. She is funny and quick witted, but behind all that lies a big pile of insecurities. She has a big crush on her co-worker Josh, but is too shy to act on it. Her bedroom reflects what a nostalgic person she is, with lots of pictures and memorabilia from her childhood, especially high school which she considers to be her glory days.

Jayme played by Chike Robinson
A musician and urbanite who has built himself a solid career over the last decade. He is talented, good looking and confident, with a heart of gold on the inside. He's been enjoying life and taking full advantage of what New York has to offer. He's never said no to temptation of any kind before, especially women. In Delia he has finally found his match and he wants to be the man he knows she deserves, but he is struggling to break his playboy habits.
 

 
Saleem played by Usama Siddiquee
An experienced comedian on his way to the top. As confident as he is on stage, in real life he doesn't see himself as the guy who gets the girl. He has feelings for Delia, who sees him as a good friend and mentor. He confesses his feelings to her, disguised as a joke, to test her reaction. When Delia hits rock bottom, he's the one to pick her back up, although he knows that he has landed in her friend zone.
 

 
Josh played by Dominick Perrier
The classic all American, good looking, midwest frat guy. He is dead set on making his last year in his 20’s count. He has a degree in nutrition but never actually used it. Years ago he moved to NYC on a dare and has never left. He is a drifter with no clear direction in life, but also annoyingly good and whatever he does. If he didn’t look the way he does, and have the personality he has, he would be homeless. He is loud, over sexual, and crass but also very sweet. Always ready for a good time.",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

I mean, who hasn’t taken an honest look at their life and seen at least one area where it comes up epically short?</p><p><strong>The idea sprang from a dinner conversation involving margaritas.</strong> Actually, a lot of margaritas. James and myself and a few others were reminiscing about a friend who, struggling with money and career setbacks, had recently and tragically taken his own life. I know, not a happy story. We realized as the night went on that several other acquaintances had done the same thing within the past few years. What was happening? All of these people were in their late 40’s and early 50’s. All of them were feeling hopeless about how their lives had turned out.</p><p><strong>But at the same time, we had other friends who we absolutely marveled at.</strong> These were people who recognized that the paths they had chosen for themselves when they were just kids out of school were not going to pan out. They needed new dreams, new careers. And so, well into their 40’s, they bravely shook things up and reinvented themselves, finding happiness and success as a result of the changes they made.</p><p><strong>Both of these are very different approaches to the same dilemma:</strong> What do you do when you realize that time is running short, the road behind you is longer than the road ahead, and your job, your marriage, your relationship with your kids, your life has not turned out at all the way you had hoped and planned when you were young?</p><p><strong>From this, The Disappointments was born.</strong> A comedy series with an edge about people in their 40’s and 50’s forced to deal with their circumstances, facing what they see as their failures and misfortunes, and taking action. Most of it ill-advised. Some of it straight-up disastrous. All in the hopes of turning their disappointing lives around.</p><p><strong>If this resonates with you and you’re moved to make a contribution, large or small, you’ll be helping us to meet the budget for a full season of The Disappointments; six episodes, each about 20 minutes long.</strong> The scripts are all written and polished and the entire team is ready to jump into production as soon as we have the funds. Over the next 45 days, you alone -- our backers -- have the power to bring this show to life.  </p><p><strong>What’s in it for you?</strong></p><p>Besides the satisfaction of getting a great show made? Plenty. We’ve dug deep to get creative with what we can offer our backers. Sure, you’ll see the standard crowdfunding perks that are tried and true. But we’ve also come up with some incentives that are fun and different and that you’ll see tie into the theme of the show.</p><p>We’re grateful for every single cent that comes our way. No amount is too small or too big!  And we look forward to expressing our gratitude through these incentives, and more!</p><p><strong>Why are we crowdfunding?</strong></p><p>The landscape of television and movies is constantly shifting, with streaming services leading the charge. Content is king and more and more people are bypassing the traditional routes, taking matters into their own hands. And the results can be astonishingly good. Our team has been inspired by filmmakers who have broken with the traditional paths to financing in order to protect their creative integrity. Coming directly to you the audience to crowdfund our budget allows us to do the same.</p><p>We’re thankful to be able to take this route as it gives us more creative freedom AND the honor of taking you on this journey with us, every step of the way. Our incentives will provide you with timely updates via email or Skype and even give a few lucky backers a chance to own a few props from the show that are featured prominently in the storyline.</p><p><strong>Where does your money go?</strong></p><p>Our team will be calling in every possible favor to keep our expenditures low -- everything from free locations to the cast raiding their closets for much of their own wardrobe -- but no matter how cost-effective and ingenious we are, there simply are some expenses that cannot be avoided.</p><p>The shoot will last approximately three weeks. During that time, we will need to cover the bills for lights, cameras, lenses, accessories, sound equipment and hard drives to store the footage. All costly items. Liability insurance is a must. It’s our obligation by law to make sure our cast and crew are always protected. There’s production design and wardrobe, extras, location rentals where needed and the transportation costs for equipment, cast and crew to get to these locations. Food is another necessity. Being on set can be an all-day affair and nobody wants to deal with a hangry actor or sound engineer. Healthy meals are crucial to keep our team functioning at 110 percent.</p><p>Our cast and crew are incredibly talented and we’re honored that they believe in our show and are willing to move Heaven and Earth to see it completed. We may not be able to pay them their going rate, but they need to be paid something in return for all their hard work. They have families to feed!  And puppies! Think of the puppies!</p><p>And then there’s post-production, another big ticket item. We could capture the most artistically framed shots and award-caliber performances, but it don’t mean a thing if we fail to put the same effort into editing, sound, music and color correction. This is what makes or breaks any show!</p><p>When everything is factored in, the number we’ve set for our campaign will allow us to make an entire season of “The Disappointments” for the lowest amount possible.</p><p>Down to the last person, we are a team dedicated to and passionate about storytelling. And “The Disappointments” is the story we all want to tell.</p><h3><strong>SOME OF THE CREATIVE TEAM</strong></h3><div>

<p>We consider it Art Coup #1 that Los Angeles artist Mark Goldberg has agreed to paint an original 36” x 48” moody seascape central to one of the storylines in the show. This a painting two characters fight over in the wake of the owner’s death. Upon completion of production, Goldberg’s piece will be shipped to whoever is lucky enough to claim it as a perk.</p>
<p>“Goldberg has harvested a prolific and diverse body of work. Enchantingly dream-like at times, his paintings are charged with emotional resonance, rife with moody symbolism... (He) has shifted from an exacting Realism to a more liberating Impressionism. His unconventional thematic color and compositional techniques have become part of his artistic statement. In doing so he confront us, quite literally, with the compelling message of his art...

</ul>
</div><p>And THANK YOU. From the bottom of our hearts. Your support means EVERYTHING!</p></div>","The Disappointments is an episodic comedy that we’ve been living and breathing for the past two years.In many ways we’ve been living it our entire lives: It’s more than a little autobiographical, which is where the biting humor and painfully relatable truths come from. I mean, who hasn’t taken an honest look at their life and seen at least one area where it comes up epically short?The idea sprang from a dinner conversation involving margaritas. Actually, a lot of margaritas. James and myself and a few others were reminiscing about a friend who, struggling with money and career setbacks, had recently and tragically taken his own life. I know, not a happy story. We realized as the night went on that several other acquaintances had done the same thing within the past few years. What was happening? All of these people were in their late 40’s and early 50’s. All of them were feeling hopeless about how their lives had turned out.But at the same time, we had other friends who we absolutely marveled at. These were people who recognized that the paths they had chosen for themselves when they were just kids out of school were not going to pan out. They needed new dreams, new careers. And so, well into their 40’s, they bravely shook things up and reinvented themselves, finding happiness and success as a result of the changes they made.Both of these are very different approaches to the same dilemma: What do you do when you realize that time is running short, the road behind you is longer than the road ahead, and your job, your marriage, your relationship with your kids, your life has not turned out at all the way you had hoped and planned when you were young?From this, The Disappointments was born. A comedy series with an edge about people in their 40’s and 50’s forced to deal with their circumstances, facing what they see as their failures and misfortunes, and taking action. Most of it ill-advised. Some of it straight-up disastrous. All in the hopes of turning their disappointing lives around.If this resonates with you and you’re moved to make a contribution, large or small, you’ll be helping us to meet the budget for a full season of The Disappointments; six episodes, each about 20 minutes long. The scripts are all written and polished and the entire team is ready to jump into production as soon as we have the funds. Over the next 45 days, you alone -- our backers -- have the power to bring this show to life.  What’s in it for you?Besides the satisfaction of getting a great show made? Plenty. We’ve dug deep to get creative with what we can offer our backers. Sure, you’ll see the standard crowdfunding perks that are tried and true. But we’ve also come up with some incentives that are fun and different and that you’ll see tie into the theme of the show.We’re grateful for every single cent that comes our way. No amount is too small or too big!  And we look forward to expressing our gratitude through these incentives, and more!Why are we crowdfunding?The landscape of television and movies is constantly shifting, with streaming services leading the charge. Content is king and more and more people are bypassing the traditional routes, taking matters into their own hands. And the results can be astonishingly good. Our team has been inspired by filmmakers who have broken with the traditional paths to financing in order to protect their creative integrity. Coming directly to you the audience to crowdfund our budget allows us to do the same.We’re thankful to be able to take this route as it gives us more creative freedom AND the honor of taking you on this journey with us, every step of the way. Our incentives will provide you with timely updates via email or Skype and even give a few lucky backers a chance to own a few props from the show that are featured prominently in the storyline.Where does your money go?Our team will be calling in every possible favor to keep our expenditures low -- everything from free locations to the cast raiding their closets for much of their own wardrobe -- but no matter how cost-effective and ingenious we are, there simply are some expenses that cannot be avoided.The shoot will last approximately three weeks. During that time, we will need to cover the bills for lights, cameras, lenses, accessories, sound equipment and hard drives to store the footage. All costly items. Liability insurance is a must. It’s our obligation by law to make sure our cast and crew are always protected. There’s production design and wardrobe, extras, location rentals where needed and the transportation costs for equipment, cast and crew to get to these locations. Food is another necessity. Being on set can be an all-day affair and nobody wants to deal with a hangry actor or sound engineer. Healthy meals are crucial to keep our team functioning at 110 percent.Our cast and crew are incredibly talented and we’re honored that they believe in our show and are willing to move Heaven and Earth to see it completed. We may not be able to pay them their going rate, but they need to be paid something in return for all their hard work. They have families to feed!  And puppies! Think of the puppies!And then there’s post-production, another big ticket item. We could capture the most artistically framed shots and award-caliber performances, but it don’t mean a thing if we fail to put the same effort into editing, sound, music and color correction. This is what makes or breaks any show!When everything is factored in, the number we’ve set for our campaign will allow us to make an entire season of “The Disappointments” for the lowest amount possible.Down to the last person, we are a team dedicated to and passionate about storytelling. And “The Disappointments” is the story we all want to tell.SOME OF THE CREATIVE TEAM

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I’m Daniel Nkoola, the writer/director of (Fake) 2018 XXL Freshman Class! If we are able to attend the NYC Web Fest, my cast and crew will have the opportunity to learn from and network with film industry practitioners/experts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our web series is a thoughtful, hilarious, and sneakily-touching commentary on what hip-hop is becoming, and who gets to be a part of it.</li>
<li>The story has resonated with both online viewers and festival judges. NYC Web Fest will give it a new platform and audience (including film producers, potential distributors, and network executives.)</li>
<li>The festival will also feature a series of panels with industry experts and practitioners; this has massive educational value for us as students.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need additional funding of roughly $4,000 to cover travel expenses for our cast &amp; crew to experience one of the most prestigious web series festivals, Web Fest, taking place in NYC. Our web series was 1 of 85 selected to be screened this year. The festival had submissions from over 12 countries. The costs will cover -- air travel, food, lodging, &amp; tickets to Web Fest.    </li>
<li>We have several perks that we are very excited to offer to the donors of the project! <ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>By focusing on web series and online content, NYC Web Fest celebrates and promotes inventive, up-and-coming filmmakers who tend to be neglected by traditional Hollywood gatekeepers.</li>
<li>In the same spirit of inclusion, (Fake) 2018 XXL Freshman Class is a tale of underdogs who go up against gatekeepers to claim a spot in a traditionally male-dominated genre of music.</li>
<li>A previous project of mine, If #Arthur was an Edgy Teen Drama, amassed over 3,500,000 views across Twitter and Facebook. This was my first indicator that the web might be a worthwhile nontraditional avenue for reaching an audience as an independent creator.</li>

<li>Our biggest obstacle is just getting to NYC all the way from Austin, Texas. We have budgeted the cheapest possible trip for the ten members of our cast and crew that are going.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Fast, comfort or gourmet--When it comes to American food, this country is best known for its array of culinary deliciousness. For example, the bacon cheeseburger at Greenwich Village Blossom’s has a lunchtime line around the block for its juicy, savory flavor. The chicken &amp; waffles at Crossroads Kitchen in LA will knock your socks off. The chimichanga at the Cheeze Factory in Wisconsin is hands down delicious. Not only are these dishes a delightful treat for your taste buds…they are also Vegan! Veggie Hunter will hunt for the best plant-based meals throughout America &amp; beyond. This includes restaurants, food trucks, street “no meats”, vegan bakeries, ice cream parlors and all! We will prove that meatless meals don’t lack in taste or adventure. Veggie Hunter will journey across the nation to interview owners, chefs…and sample the yummy food along the way.</p>
<p>Hosted by DJ CherishTheLuv &amp; Regina Mitchell, our goal is to highlight the plant-based food scene that is underrepresented. Veggie Hunter will fill the void and highlight the unique culinary art form involved with vegan meals. Many people are becoming meat reducers, creating a rapidly growing market for all things vegan. So much that restaurants are now changing their menus to offer vegan entrées. Veggie Hunter will hunt for these restaurants, sample the food &amp; be the ""go to"" show for vegans, vegetarians, meat reducers and foodies everywhere!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help. We are aiming to raise $5k or more to assist with season 2 of Veggie Hunter. With this donation you will help contribute to the expenses associated with each shoot.  In order to capture a wide-range of vegan eateries, we need your donation to help pay for equipment, location fees, crew and transportation costs.  We are a bare bones crew; limited to shooting within the surrounding area only. We want our viewers to have the complete vegan culinary experience. The more locations we cover, the more insane and delicious food we'll showcase to our viewers!</p>
<p>We are offering great perks in return for your generous contributions!   Perks include a thank you email with one of our favorite vegan recipes, shout out on social media, your name in the credits, Veggie Hunter t-shirt, an episode shout out by our fabulous show hosts and the opportunity to be a guest on the show!! That's right, we will have a special Fan Favorite episode just for you! We will interview  you at your favorite <strong>local</strong> vegan restaurant.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a huge misconception about vegan &amp; vegetarian food. Many believe that meatless meals are bland &amp; boring. We are here to prove them wrong!  We will show that vegan meals don't lack in taste or adventure!</p>
<p>We are facing challenges from our ability to cover all of the production costs needed for Season 2. Veggie Hunter is a food road show and getting around has been extremely challenging. We want to discover an array of locations and be the go to source for not just vegans and vegetarians, but foodies everywhere. This is why we need your help!</p>

Fast, comfort or gourmet--When it comes to American food, this country is best known for its array of culinary deliciousness. For example, the bacon cheeseburger at Greenwich Village Blossom’s has a lunchtime line around the block for its juicy, savory flavor. The chicken & waffles at Crossroads Kitchen in LA will knock your socks off. The chimichanga at the Cheeze Factory in Wisconsin is hands down delicious. Not only are these dishes a delightful treat for your taste buds…they are also Vegan! Veggie Hunter will hunt for the best plant-based meals throughout America & beyond. This includes restaurants, food trucks, street “no meats”, vegan bakeries, ice cream parlors and all! We will prove that meatless meals don’t lack in taste or adventure. Veggie Hunter will journey across the nation to interview owners, chefs…and sample the yummy food along the way.
Hosted by DJ CherishTheLuv & Regina Mitchell, our goal is to highlight the plant-based food scene that is underrepresented. Veggie Hunter will fill the void and highlight the unique culinary art form involved with vegan meals. Many people are becoming meat reducers, creating a rapidly growing market for all things vegan. So much that restaurants are now changing their menus to offer vegan entrées. Veggie Hunter will hunt for these restaurants, sample the food & be the ""go to"" show for vegans, vegetarians, meat reducers and foodies everywhere!

deal before the KL – BCN Trip Vlog starts, is that, if with your help we reach the goal to buy the stuff and motorcycle, to get ready for the next LYOS.TV trip, we will release 5 Chapters on the

Living in the Car</p><p> </p><p><strong>That means that it would be $ 1,111 usd per chapter.</strong></p><p>In this procedure you guys will be motivated to see more and more with actual results in

have more Indonesian chapters and the faster the KL-BCN will come to live.</p><p> </p><p>After this first goal, the crowd funding will be on Demand, meaning that it will continue so we can keep

expenses of many months with the weekly capsules on real time of the KL to BCN project.</p><p>After the “first season” with the 16 chapters, you will see that the main porpuse of LYOS.TV is to show reality…</p><p>Some chapters are about beautiful places, victories and summiting mountains… some about happy, relaxing and party times… some about failures… some others are sad and even about illness recoveries… learning at the end, that no matter what shit happens in our life... we have to get up again… yes, get up... always…</p><p><strong>The thing of LYOS.TV is showing you “travel life”… just as it is… with the goals, the dreams and the obstacles… with the ups and downs that we all have… because at the end, everybody knows that… life is not easy…</strong></p><p>So after the Indonesian Vlog, the real time travel capsules of the new Vlog will have a different format.</p><p>Each chapter of the fist Vlog resumed the story traveling time of months in 15 minutes.</p><p>Some were formed with 1 month of traveling, others with 2 months and another with 2 weeks… and even there is one chapter, done with 11 days of traveling time…</p><p>The new Video Blog format on weekly chapters to cover the Motorcycle Trip, will be that every Sunday, Lyos will grab the camera and tell you all what happened in the last week… from Monday to Sunday…</p><p>We think each chapter will be a 4 or 5 minutes video, illustrated with footage and photos… or maybe more with special edition and music.</p><p>But each chapter duration will depend on reality… on how entertaining were the places and the activities of that single week.</p><p>And the best thing in this new project, is that we can focus the chapters on more interesting details.</p><p>We will have seven days of storytelling in 5 minutes and we don´t have to rush taking away a lot of stuff and details, just to focus on the most amazing things of the trip…</p><p>And don´t get confused, the most amazing parts of the trip will be there... just this time the narration will get more detailed and personal…</p><p> </p><p><strong>A motorcycle trip from Kuala Lumpur to Barcelona by land… crossing 33 countries and some of the most

Spain... Video Blog from Kuala Lumpur to Barcelona, in which LYOS, a Video Producer/Climber/Explorer from Mexico, will be documenting everything that happens... We have to tell you the story really fast...Past:LYOS left Mexico 11 years ago and captured with his cameras 40 countries in 5 continents.In 2008 he started a Motorcycle Trip from KL to Madrid... but was interrupted by an Avalanche when he was climbing Mount Everest and canceled the trip...He did only 1/4 of the route...  Today:Now 9 years later, Lyos wants to finish that trip, documentating everything on weekly chapters on a Travel Vlog.So, this Crowd Funding is to get the trip started.Also you need to know what you will get for your money. For that, Lyos will upload the chapters of the Indonesian Vlog he did and edited to

But there are always some extra expenses and to make it easier, we will say $ 1,000 usd per month.2 Year Trip = 24 months = $ 24,000 usd daily travelling expenses.Cost of the second hand motorcycle and international Carnet de Passage papers, so the motorcycle can cross borders with Lyos = $ 5,000 usd.Cost of the Video and Action Cameras = $ 2,000 usd.Web Site to keep you informed with chapters and photos updated all the trip = $ 1,000 usd.Costs for Visas, Subtitling, Repairs, Indiegogo Fees and more = $ 1,000 usd.Total Cost of the 2 Year Vlog Trip from Kuala Lumpur to Barcelona = $ 33,000 usd. Doing this project on a budget trying to save money is important.$10 usd food and $10 usd accommodation, will force Lyos to maintain a simple more connected to the place and people´s day to day life.Meaning that sometimes he will have to share rooms in hostels, eat street food or bargain about any touristic service or expeditions on the trip…All these situations will force him to meet people and make new friends everywhere… making the stories of the trip richer and unique…  Since you don´t know what to expect of this motorcycle trip, we are dividing the funding of LYOS.TV new Vlog in 2 stages.The first stage is already this crowd funding from Indiegogo to start the Motorcycle Trip to Barcelona, asking for the first $ 5,555 usd. That´s just to cover the 2 principal costs:1. - Buying a second hand Chopper Motorcycle for = $ 3,555 usd2. - Buying the new Video Camera and the Action Camera for = $ 2,000 usd The prices for the cameras online and also in many electronic stores already checked in Kuala Lumpur, tells us that $ 2,000 usd are enough to cover the cost of buying them new.The second hand motorcycle price is more difficult to calculate.Lyos checked prices the last time he was in some places of Malaysia and KL, and a 5 year old Chopper was between $ 3,000 and $ 3,500 usdSo we will put the cost on $ 3,555 usd to make sure he can buy it and also because 555 is Lyos favorite number. He knows that reaching this first goal to buy this is not going to be easy…Also even a little bit harder if you guys don´t know what to expect about all the journey or if you are doubting if Lyos work is worth it or not.The only thing that we can do, if you didn´t watched it before, is show you the Chapter 1 of the first LYOS.TV project.A Video Blog of Indonesia in Spanish with English and French subtitles, totally produced and edited by Lyos.LYOS.TV - Chapter 01 – The Dream… This chapter and all the Indonesian Vlog, has no script or camera crew, is a Solo Trip filmed in 10 countries: Spain, England, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and the narrations are based in Indonesia, with chapters in Borneo, Sumatra, Java and Bali.  The story is exactly as it happened... without enough money, without rules and without plans… has 16 Chapters… and the list is here:1       The Dream…2       See You Later3       Return to Melbourne4       The Project5       Living in the Car6       Mount Cook Fall7       Sri Lanka Fix8       Philippines Fall9       A Better Year10     Exploring Borneo11      Sumatra Fall12     Thay Relyoaded13.1  Crossing to... Bali13.2  Macho Motorcycle Dream Trip13.3  The Immortal13.4   Ubud  All the chapters will be something between 14 - 15 minutes… but remember that the most important thing of this project, is the TRUTH.So, we will try to make the chapters duration as standard as possible, even though sometimes reality is way different than expected and we can´t control it.Still, we will never bore our viewers with a chapter that is longer than it should be… or so fast that you can´t enjoy it...So, the first deal before the KL – BCN Trip Vlog starts, is that, if with your help we reach the goal to buy the stuff and motorcycle, to get ready for the next LYOS.TV trip, we will release 5 Chapters on the $ 5,555 usd goal.You already have:Chapter 01 – The Dream… So after this is done, we will release:Chapter 02 - See You LaterChapter 03 - Return to MelbourneChapter 04 - The ProjectChapter 05 - Living in the Car That means that it would be $ 1,111 usd per chapter.In this procedure you guys will be motivated to see more and more with actual results in hand, while the real project that you are funding has not even started yet.Meaning that you are receiving and being part of 2 Vlogs for the funding of 1…This has to convince you to help us and spread this campaign with your friends, so later more people´s help will join us on the way to start the KL – BCN Vlog.The faster you fund and spread this project, the faster you will have more Indonesian chapters and the faster the KL-BCN will come to live. After this first goal, the crowd funding will be on Demand, meaning that it will continue so we can keep releasing the chapters 6, 7, 8, 9… and every $ 1,111 usd we will upload one more until reaching number 16.  When we reach that point, LYOS.TV will have $ 17,777 usd of funding… little more than half of the total money that it´s needed to start and finish the new $ 33,000 usd 2 year Vlog until BCN.Half of money is enough to cover the expenses of many months with the weekly capsules on real time of the KL to BCN project.After the “first season” with the 16 chapters, you will see that the main porpuse of LYOS.TV is to show reality…Some chapters are about beautiful places, victories and summiting mountains… some about happy, relaxing and party times… some about failures… some others are sad and even about illness recoveries… learning at the end, that no matter what shit happens in our life... we have to get up again… yes, get up... always…The thing of LYOS.TV is showing you “travel life”… just as it is… with the goals, the dreams and the obstacles… with the ups and downs that we all have… because at the end, everybody knows that… life is not easy…So after the Indonesian Vlog, the real time travel capsules of the new Vlog will have a different format.Each chapter of the fist Vlog resumed the story traveling time of months in 15 minutes.Some were formed with 1 month of traveling, others with 2 months and another with 2 weeks… and even there is one chapter, done with 11 days of traveling time…The new Video Blog format on weekly chapters to cover the Motorcycle Trip, will be that every Sunday, Lyos will grab the camera and tell you all what happened in the last week… from Monday to Sunday…We think each chapter will be a 4 or 5 minutes video, illustrated with footage and photos… or maybe more with special edition and music.But each chapter duration will depend on reality… on how entertaining were the places and the activities of that single week.And the best thing in this new project, is that we can focus the chapters on more interesting details.We will have seven days of storytelling in 5 minutes and we don´t have to rush taking away a lot of stuff and details, just to focus on the most amazing things of the trip…And don´t get confused, the most amazing parts of the trip will be there... just this time the narration will get more detailed and personal… A motorcycle trip from Kuala Lumpur to Barcelona by land… crossing 33 countries and some of the most difficult places in the world… alone… telling the story as it goes on a limited budget... trust LYOS.TV, we are sure it will be amazing and totally worth it.  The motorcycle gives a different perspective when you travel…It is freedom… and gives you the opportunity to get to the corners where no foreigner or even average locals go… just because we can… and just because going to hidden and unknown places, is exactly the way in which we can use the word ""explore""…So let´s go and see what happens… let´s discover real people, real places and real stories…Doesn´t matter in what you are interested… Rivers, Temples, Waterfalls, Animals, Religions, Villages, Mountains, Jungles, Sports, Orphanages, Beaches…Whatever you are looking for, the motorcycle is destined to take us there and beyond to find something new…And this time, even with the option that if you are passionate about something else… or you know anything interesting somewhere… an orphanage or a special secret place along the route… write us... we will make sure it will be soon on LYOS.TV… Amazing Trip that with your Help… will be a Reality very Soon…

vez en el 2020.Después de 11 años viajando fuera de México y su experiencia con el viaje en Moto anterior en Asia que duró 20 meses... Video que ya les enseñamos antes... Lyos ha calculado que necesita $33,000 usd para el viaje de KL a BCN en moto.Recaudación de Dinero:Costo de viajar por mes = $ 1,000 usd.Eso fue calculado con gastos por día: $10 usd para comida, $10 usd para gasolina y $10 usd para el hotel.Eso significa que son $ 30 usd x 30 días… $ 900 usd. Pero siempre hay algunos gastos extras y para hacerlo más fácil, diremos que son $ 1,000 usd por mes.2 Años de Viaje = 24 meses = $ 24,000 usd de gastos de viaje.Costo de una motocicleta usada y el Carnet de Passage internacional, para que la moto pueda cruzar fronteras con Lyos = $ 5,000 usd.Costo de la Cámara de Video y la Action Camera = $ 2,000 usd.Página Web para mantenerlos informados con los capítulos y fotos actualizadas del viaje = $ 1,000 usd.Costo de Visas, Subtítulos, Reparaciones, Indiegogo y más = $ 1,000 usd.Costo Total Vlog de Viaje de 2 Años de Kuala Lumpur a Barcelona = $ 33,000 usd. Realizar éste proyecto con presupuesto intentando ahorrar dinero es importante.$10 usd para comida y $10 usd de hotel, hará que Lyos mantenga una vida simple y más conectada con las personas locales en su día a día.Algunas veces tendrá que compartir cuartos en hostales, comer en la calle o regatear cualquier actividad o servicio turístico o expediciones en el viaje…Todas estas situaciones lo forzarán a conocer gente y hacer nuevos amigos en todas partes... haciendo que las historias en el viaje sean más valiosas y únicas...  Ya que ustedes no saben que esperar de este viaje en moto, vamos a dividir la recaudación de fondos del Vlog LYOS.TV en 2 etapas.La primera etapa será ésta campaña en Indiegogo para empezar el Viaje en Moto a Barcelona, pidiendo los primeros $ 5,555 usd. Eso es solamente para cubrir los 2 costos principales:1. - Comprar la Motocicleta Chopper usada por = $ 3,555 usd2. - Comprar la Cámara de Video y la Action Camera por = $ 2,000 usd Los precios de las cámaras en línea y también en varias tiendas electrónicas de Kuala Lumpur, nos dice que $ 2,000 usd son suficientes para cubrir el costo de comprarlas nuevas.El precio de la moto usada será más difícil de calcular.Lyos checó precios la última vez que estuvo en algunos lugares de Malasia y KL, y una Chopper con 5 años de uso estaba entre $ 3,000 y $ 3,500 usdAsí que pondremos el precio en $ 3,555 usd para asegurarnos de que se pueda comprar además de que 555 es el número favorito de Lyos. El sabe que alcanzar esa primer meta para comprar ésto no será fácil…E incluso un poco difícil si ustedes no saben qué va a resultar de este viaje o si están dudando si el trabajo de Lyos vale la pena o no.Por ello si no lo vieron antes, lo primero que queremos enseñarles es el Capítulo 01 del primer proyecto de LYOS.TVUn Video Blog de Indonesia en Español con subtítulos en Inglés y Francés por ahora, totalmente producido y editado por Lyos.LYOS.TV - Chapter 01 – The Dream…

 
Éste capítulo y todo el Vlog de Indonesia, no tiene script ni asistentes de cámara, es un viaje en solitario grabado en 10 países: España, Inglaterra, Australia, Nueva Zelanda, Sri Lanka, Malasia, Filipinas, Singapur, Tailandia y las narraciones fueron grabadas en Indonesia, con capítulos en Borneo, Sumatra, Java y Bali.  La historia es exactamente como se vivió... sin dinero extra, sin reglas y sin planes... tiene 16 Capítulos… y son éstos:1       The Dream…2       See You Later3       Return to Melbourne4      The Project5       Living in the Car6       Mount Cook Fall7       Sri Lanka Fix8       Philippines Fall9       A Better Year10     Exploring Borneo11      Sumatra Fall12     Thay Relyoaded13.1   Crossing to... Bali13.2  Macho Motorcycle Dream Trip13.3  The Immortal13.4   Ubud  Todos los capítulos durarán entre 14 y 15 minutos… pero recuerden que lo más importante de éste proyecto, es la VERDAD.Así, trataremos de hacer la duración de los capítulos lo más estándares posible, aunque algunas veces la realidad sea muy diferente a lo que se esperaba y no la podamos controlar.Aún así, jamás aburriremos al espectador con capítulos más largos de lo que deberían ser... o tan rápidos que no los puedan disfrutar...Entonces el primer trato antes de que el Vlog de KL a BCN empiece, es que si nos ayudan a alcanzar la meta para comprar la moto y preparar el siguiente viaje de LYOS.TV, les daremos 5 Capítulos al llegar a la meta de los $ 5,555 usd.Ustedes ya vieron el primero:Chapter 01 – The Dream… Después de  alcanzar la meta, les subiremos:Chapter 02 - See You LaterChapter 03 - Return to MelbourneChapter 04 - The ProjectChapter 05 - Living in the Car Eso significa que serán $ 1,111 usd por capítulo.En ese esquema siempre estarán motivados para ver más capítulos, sabiendo que lo que tendrán será de calidad, mientras que el proyecto que de verdad están financiando ni siquiera ha empezado.En pocas palabras les estamos dando y forman parte de 2 Vlogs por financiar 1…Esto debe convencerlos de ayudarnos y compartir ésta campaña con sus amigos para que más personas nos ayuden y se nos unan para empezar el Vlog de KL a BCN. Entre más rápido financien y compartan éste proyecto, más rápido tendrán más capítulos de Indonesia y más rápido podrá empezar el viaje de KL a BCN. Después de ésta primer meta, la campaña crowd funding seguirá on Demand, lo que significa que continuará para seguir financiándonos y podamos darles los siguientes capítulos 6, 7, 8, 9… y así cada vez que juntemos $ 1,111 usd se subirá uno más hasta llegar al 16.  Cuando lleguemos a ese punto, LYOS.TV tendrá $ 17,777 usd financiados… un poco más de la mitad del dinero total que se necesita para empezar y terminar el nuevo Vlog de $ 33,000 usd de viaje por 2 años hasta BCN.La mitad del dinero es suficiente para cubrir los gastos de varios meses de viaje con los capítulos semanales en tiempo real del proyecto de KL a BCN.Después la ""primer temporada” con 16 capítulos, ya habrán visto que el objetivo principal de LYOS.TV es mostrar la realidad…Algunos capítulos son acerca de lugares chidos, victorias y escaladas de montañas… algunos son felices, relajados y de fiesta... algunos de fracasos... algunos otros tristes y recuperándose de enfermedades... aprendiendo que al final, no importa la chinga que nos ponga la vida... nos tenemos que levantar otra vez... así es, levantarse...  siempre...En LYOS.TV queremos mostrarles lo que es “estar de viaje”… tal cual es… con las metas, los sueños y los obstáculos… con los altibajos que todos tenemos... porque al final, todos sabemos que… la vida no es fácil…Así que después del Vlog de Indonesia, las cápsulas de viaje en tiempo real del nuevo Vlog tendrán un formato distinto.Cada capítulo del primer Vlog resume la historia de tiempo de viaje de meses en 15 minutos.Algunos se hicieron con 1 mes de viaje, otros con 2 meses y otro con 2 semanas… e incluso hay un capítulo que se hizo con 11 días de tiempo de viaje…El nuevo formato del Video Blog semanal para el Viaje en Moto, será que todos los Domingos, Lyos agarrará la cámara y les contará todo lo que ha pasado en esa semana… de Lunes a Domingo…Creemos que cada capítulo será de 4 o 5 minutes de video, ilustrado con imágenes y fotos… o tal vez más con edición especial y música.Pero la duración de cada capítulo dependerá de la realidad… de que tan entretenidos fueron los lugares y las actividades de esa semana.Y la mejor parte de éste nuevo proyecto, es que podremos enfocar los capítulos en los detalles más interesantes.Tendremos 7 días de historias que contar en 5 minutos y no tenemos la presión de quitar muchas cosas y detalles, sólo para enfocarnos en las cosas increíbles del viaje...Y no se confundan, las cosas más increíbles del viaje van a estar... sólo que ahora la narrativa será aún más detallada y personal... Un viaje en motocicleta de Kuala Lumpur a Barcelona por tierra... cruzando 33 países y algunos de los lugares más difíciles del mundo... sólo... contando la historia tal como pasó con presupuesto limitado... confía en LYOS.TV, estamos seguros que valdrá la pena y será increíble.  La motocicleta te da una perspectiva diferente cuando viajas…Es completa libertad… y te da la oportunidad de llegar a lugares remotos donde ningún extranjero ni los locales normalmente van... sólo porque podemos ir... y sólo porque ir a esos lugares ocultos y desconocidos, es exactamente la forma en la que podemos usar la palabra ""explorar""...Así que vamos a ver qué pasa… descubramos personas, lugares e historias reales…No importa que es lo que te interese… Ríos, Templos, Cascadas, Animales, Religiones, Aldeas, Montañas, Selvas, Deportes, Culturas, Playas... Lo que sea que estés buscando, la motocicleta está destinada a llevarnos allá y aún mucho más lejos, para encontrar algo nuevo…Y ésta vez, con la opción de que si te apasiona alguna otra cosa... o sabes de algún lugar interesante por ahí... algún orfanatorio o algo por la ruta especial y secreto... escríbenos... lo visitaremos para ponerlo próximamente en LYOS.TV… Un Viaje Increíble que con tu Ayuda… será una Realidad muy Pronto…  ℒ५٥೭   ​Si no puedes Ayudarnos con Donaciones,por favor Comparte este Crowdfunding con tus Familiares y Amigos o el video.https://youtu.be/ouzTt_HbHhoTodos los detalles de los Premios por Apoyar a LYOS.TV en éste Link:https://www.indiegogo.com/project/preview/757c3955",82.0,5,"2 Campaigns

<p>At the age of 16, I began crying and didn't stop for two weeks. It was then that I had my first known incident with depression. Since then, I have consistently battled mental illness throughout my life. Many times, I felt alone and ashamed. So alone, that I tried to end it all.  It  was a very scary and low point in my life.</p>
<p>Actress Carrie Fisher said, ""take your broken heart and turn it into art."" That is how <strong><i>Crazy with a K!</i> </strong>came to be and this is why I am so passionate about it.</p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign, we can give a voice to a show that will reach people who experience mental illness. A show that will let them know that they are not alone. A show that will encourage them to move past the shame and pain often associated with this disease, to talk about it and hopefully seek treatment. If <i><strong>Crazy with a K!</strong> </i>can save one life, then this entire endeavor will have been worth it.</p>

<h3>Let's be real...</h3>
<p>It is very hard for small independent projects to make a dent in Hollywood. It is harder for <strong>women</strong> led projects and it is even harder for projects led by <strong>women of color</strong>. This is often due to a lack of interest and financial support because studios think no one wants to see these types of films and tv shows. That is why crowdfunding is so necessary. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>The 411...</h3>
<p>We have invested our own money and even our savings to finance the first stages of <i><strong>Crazy with a K!</strong></i> -- including pre-production and most of production.<i><strong>  </strong></i>To maximize our funds, we often wore multiple hats and relied on the generosity of our entertainment community and friends who believed in us and the story we were telling. </p>
<p>But in order to complete the final stages of <i><strong>CWAK!</strong></i>, we need <strong>$30K</strong>. These necessary funds will enable us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>PAY</strong> our actors</li>
<li>
<strong>PAY </strong>our production crew</li>
<li>
<strong>PAY</strong> our post-production team</li>
</ul>
<p>By taking care of these things we can ensure a high quality and polished final product that hopefully will catch the attention of industry higher ups <i>(like Tina Fey...)</i> so that Joey's story and the story of so many others that struggle with mental illness can be told on a larger scale.</p>

<p>After being active in the theatre and film world for multiple decades I became frustrated with the constant stereotypical and limited story lines for women and people of color repeatedly presented as truth on screen.  I wanted to tell stories from a different perspective.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a Vancouver-based filmmaker and artist who's been creating, preforming and collaborating to make art in many of its forms, for more than a decade. I graduated Vancouver's Nimbus School with a degree in Post and Game Audio Production and since then, have implemented sound design and composed for a number of short and full-length films.</p>
<p>Over the last several years, as I continued to help people tell their stories, the desire to tell my own, grew and grew until I couldn't refrain from telling them any longer!</p>
<p>Over the last, year I have been writing, producing, directing, implementing music and sound design for an ambitious, wholly original web-series called LITTER, which fictionalizes, distorts and chronicles the last two trimesters of my wife's pregnancy, culminating with the actual birth of our son, Bowie, on Christmas day 2019! </p>
<p>The project is obviously very, very near and dear to our hearts. It has been our singular focus for the last year. It has been completely self-funded and I have done 90% of the necessary  post-production myself. </p>
<p>We can see the finish line, coming over the horizon to meet us. In this final stretch, we seek funds to help pay for the post-production services I am unable to complete myself.  The series needs full color design and animation for titles and several key sequences. </p>
<p>We also need funds to help pay for music licensing. We are currently in search of the right Vancouver-based band or bands to serve as the musical voice of the project and we are also in talks with Philadelphia band, Sheer Mag, to use one or more of their songs.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking $5000 to pay for color design, animation, music licensing and festival submissions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Our color designer will be getting at least, $900 (probably more). Around $10/min.</li>
<li>Our animator will also be getting at least $1000 (hopefully more)</li>
<li>We expect to pay at least $1000 for music sync licenses (maybe more)</li>
<li>We will be submitting for festivals over the next couple years as well as advertising and marketing which will be at least $1000 (probably more)</li>
</ol>
<p>Donations of $500 or more will receive a Producer's credit for the entire series!</p>
<p>All donations of $200 or more will receive audio and video production services by me at a 1 to 1 value! Meaning, I will work for you for donations at my standard $50/hr rate, 1 hour of my work for every $50 you donate (starting at $200). The work can be for someone else or spread out over time or reserved for later! Donate, save the hours and hit me up in five years and get my time for a hell of a bargain!</p>
<p>If we do not meet our full goal, the money will first and foremost go towards the color designer and animator. Anything after that, to the band, and anything after that, to help with festival submissions, advertising and marketing.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are a heck of a lot of people on the planet. So, naturally, a lot of people have been through pregnancy and child birth.  Everyone has a story. It is an amazing, exciting experience. So much change and growth.</p>
<p>As my wife and I entered our pregnancy with the newfound passion for storytelling, we discussed how pregnancy is shown in movies and TV. In our opinion, there's a lot about pregnancy that's never shown. Most people don't have a hallmark pregnancy and kodak birth. It's raw and gross and beautiful and scary and stressful and a million other things.</p>
<p>Also, what about women who get pregnant who have addiction problems? What about single, expecting mothers who are broke artists, getting evicted and dealing with real life? We hadn't seen much of anything like that before, so we decided that was the story we wanted to tell. We began writing and casting and organizing for production. </p>
<p>Over the next year, we went through our pregnancy and life as anyone else would have, except that we were writing real life situations and challenges in to our story. As Candace was experiencing these new things, we were channeling them in to our art.  As life was throwing us curve-balls, we were catching 'em and turning them in to episodes and anecdotes.</p>
<p>Not only does this series show a side of pregnancy, child birth and life that is rarely shown, it also breaks the genre barriers, morphing between fiction and chronicle. A new kind of storytelling that distorts reality, reflected back in a wavy, fun-house mirror.</p>
<p>This story will speak volumes to one of the biggest groups of people in the world; peoplewho  have gone through pregnancy and child birth! As we come to know and love our main character, Suzy, we're taken along for her amazing maternal journey and get to actually see the moment when she meets her baby! For Real!! This is a truly, momentous, heavy, wondrous, hilarious, weird and wacky story of love and life that will, undoubtedly, find its loving audience upon being unleashed on the world!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge telling this story is to get people past the first few episodes. This is only because of the subject matter. In the first episode, our main character, Suzy, lays on her bed, chain-smoking and using a dating app on repeat. After a long while, she chugs a glass of wine and gets up, finally revealing a very pregnant belly!  It is meant to be a shocking reveal. It is meant to conflict, confuse and possibly anger the audience. </p>
<p>My wife had a few puffs of herbal cigarettes, not inhaling, and drank cranberry juice!</p>
<p>We wanted to have Suzy start at the bottom, surrounded by trash and filth and wallowing in it. It gives her somewhere to go and grow! It makes for an amazing journey to watch a resentful pregnant woman with terrible habits, transform in to a capable, loving mother, before our very eyes! </p>
<p>It will be hard for a lot of people to watch a pregnant person drink and smoke. The truth of life is, however, there are a lot of women who smoke and drink during pregnancy. We all know you shouldn't, but addiction is a serious issue and can override better judgement. It is a dark, cruel reality that people don't want to see.  This will be our biggest challenge.</p>
<p>In the first episode, immediately following the pregnant reveal and title, there will be a large disclaimer, stating that ""no actual cigarettes or alcohol were consumed in the making of this production,"" or something to that effect (will be drafting with lawyer/producer). This same disclaimer will also be a key part of all descriptions, press releases, campaigns or any promoting, advertising or releasing of the series, clear for everyone to see. I believe this will effectively nullify this concern, although it will still be difficult to watch for some, as it's meant to be.</p>

I'm a Vancouver-based filmmaker and artist who's been creating, preforming and collaborating to make art in many of its forms, for more than a decade. I graduated Vancouver's Nimbus School with a degree in Post and Game Audio Production and since then, have implemented sound design and composed for a number of short and full-length films.
Over the last several years, as I continued to help people tell their stories, the desire to tell my own, grew and grew until I couldn't refrain from telling them any longer!
Over the last, year I have been writing, producing, directing, implementing music and sound design for an ambitious, wholly original web-series called LITTER, which fictionalizes, distorts and chronicles the last two trimesters of my wife's pregnancy, culminating with the actual birth of our son, Bowie, on Christmas day 2019! 
The project is obviously very, very near and dear to our hearts. It has been our singular focus for the last year. It has been completely self-funded and I have done 90% of the necessary  post-production myself. 
We can see the finish line, coming over the horizon to meet us. In this final stretch, we seek funds to help pay for the post-production services I am unable to complete myself.  The series needs full color design and animation for titles and several key sequences. 
We also need funds to help pay for music licensing. We are currently in search of the right Vancouver-based band or bands to serve as the musical voice of the project and we are also in talks with Philadelphia band, Sheer Mag, to use one or more of their songs. Music sync licenses can get pretty pricey and the series requires upwards of 20 original songs so we are hoping to also raise funds for this purpose.
In addition, we will  be using funds to help pay for festival submissions, advertising, distribution and release strategy, upon completion.
I've been making art for three decades and this is by far the most important, ambitious and completely original thing I've ever been part of.  This series will make waves. It will challenge some people, inspire others, make people laugh and cry. It will bring the audience along for a journey through seasons and the changing body of a pregnant woman as she transforms in to a caring mother.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Brandon and I am the writer and creator of Minimum Wage, a locally produced sitcom about the employees of a local coffee shop. I wrote this show because I find joy in performing and putting smiles on people's faces. I joined together with many of the talented actors in Central Illinois, as well as one of the best videographers in the area, and an AMAZING local coffee shop to create something special! </p>

</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have actors who deal with a lot of the issues we will be tackling in this show.

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>COVID-19 has greatly impacted the film industry, and we have not been immune to the challenges that come with filming a sitcom during a global pandemic. We strive to create a safe environment for our cast and crew when on set by requiring masks when not on screen, cleaning equipment and props frequently, and keeping as much distance as possible between extras, crew members, and actors. Due to the ongoing pandemic, we are always at risk of not being allowed by state and local government to film at certain times of spikes in COVID-19 cases. If  and when this happens, filming will be delayed until we can safely gather to film.</p>

<p>We've all been asked this question at one point or another. It's a question our team has gone in depth about - the way it's made us feel, the way it's been used against us. The dreaded: ""Yeah, but where are you <i>really</i> from?""

<p>WAYRF is a 30-ish minute TV drama which follows 17-year-old Jazlyn De Los Santos, whose life turns upside down when her mother returns from working abroad.

<p>At its core, <i>Where Are You Really From? </i>is about generational divide and generational unity, about discovering your identity, and the learning and unlearning that comes along with all of it. </p>

<p>We know asking for donations is a big request. And we're fundraising a big amount. But what we're really asking for is to give those who we don't see in mainstream media, a chance to be seen; a chance at something bigger than all of us. </p>
<p>Our executive team is made up of 3 students, and because we believe in this project as much as we hope you do, we've each donated $500 of our own funds to get us started. So instead of our original 12.5K, we're asking for 11K. </p>
<p>So let's break it down: </p>
<p><strong>Locations: $4,300</strong></p>
<p>We're hoping to film at two primary locations and two secondary locations. Our costs have been alleviated through partnerships with Ryerson University, but locations are the biggest part - without them we basically don't have a space to shoot this pilot! </p>
<p><strong>Transport &amp; Craft: $2,700</strong></p>
<p>Something you might not know about indie student productions: everyone, from cast to crew, is pretty much a volunteer. Meaning, they're volunteering their time to make sure this show becomes a reality - and to thank them for it we feed them (yes, TV is <i>this </i>glamorous). Not only that but sometimes we'll have to move our peeps from Point A to Point B, and that includes drivers, fuel, rentals, and just a lot of transport to keep the ship sailing. </p>
<p><strong>Equipment: $2,500</strong></p>
<p>Luckily we're students studying Television Arts and we've got some equipment to tide us over. But, if we're being honest, it's not enough for a 30-minute TV show (plus, we can't get greedy, there are a lot of other great productions at work). So while we can use some of the provided equipment, we'll also have to rent a whole lot more - and you guessed it, it gets costly! </p>
<p><strong>Wardrobe and Set: $1,400</strong></p>
<p>Not to brag, but a lot of our team are expert thrifters. We're a pretty stylish bunch if you ask us - and we want the same for our characters and sets (and on a budget, just like us!). So, for the most part our items will be borrowed or donated, but others will have to be thrifted or bought. And sure, one thrifted T-Shirt is pretty inexpensive but, 10 days of outfits is a different story. </p>
<p><strong>Marketing: $1,200</strong></p>
<p>Creating a show is cool and all, but we kind of need people to <i>see </i>it, to <i>know </i>about it, and to <i>want</i> to talk about it. This all comes down to the marketing. Eventually, we'll want to have a premiere and celebrate this episode with all of you who helped make it happen, and in order to do that we've gotta clear room for our marketing budget. </p>
<p><strong>Health &amp; Safety: $400</strong></p>
<p>More than ever, we want our team to be safe. We're ensuring our whole crew has the proper PPE - from masks to face shields to gloves, you name it and we've got it! </p>
<p><strong>For a grand total of $12,500! </strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p>We really hope we make our goal, but we do have a contingency plan! No goal? No problem. We'll just have to scale back. That means that some folks on set might have to wear multiple hats, we might have to cut a scene or two, and we might have to change a location. Our show will still get made, it'll just get made differently.</p>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p><strong>You Were Here</strong> is a planned 4-part web series focusing on a trio of friends in the wake of a tragedy. <strong>David</strong>, a quiet but once hopeful man has lost all faith after his best friend and housemate Oscar dies suddenly; <strong>Joss</strong>, a carefree childhood companion of David's is on the run from a mistake he made; and <strong>Angie</strong>, a  timid school friend of Oscar's is trying to break free of the shackles of her family. Everyone has struggles. These are theirs. Over 4 episodes we will see these characters evolve and react as they grow up just a little bit more. </p>
<p>The story deals with themes of identity, sexuality and existentialism.</p>
<p>The series was created by Oliver Wilson-Smith, the director and co-writer. He is joined by colleague Georgie Plant as Producer and co-writer. Together they work under the company Lime 58 Films, started in 2016 and focusing on comedic films. This is their first foray into more dramatic territory and is an exciting prospect.</p>

<h3>The Money</h3>
<p>The money contributed to this campaign will go straight into the budget - e.g.feeding cast and crew, hiring actors, etc. The target will allow us to comfortably cover our basic expenses to allow for a 10 day shoot.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Risks</h3>
<p>This project may be ambitious but we, the creative team, have produced high-quality content before on far less and we have consistently delivered. This can be seen with our documentary, Lammas, and our comedy, Dan Can Save You.</p>
<p>Our producer has a well considered budget and has previously handled the financing of our projects. The chance of us not delivering the quality content you expect is next to zero.</p>
<p>Our director and series creator has formed this project from personal experiences and the entire team desires this to be a respectful and loyal portrayal of all issues highlighted in the series whilst still being a highly entertaining product for you, the viewer.</p>

<h3><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></h3>
<p>This steamy Romeo and Juliet, simmering with supernatural elements, will sink its hooks into your heart and leave you scarred (or lustful) long after you're done watching.</p>
<p>Zahara is a one hour tragic love story about a century-old druid trapped in an adolescent’s body who, like every other girl out there, dreams of living happily-ever-after with her soulmate. But in a world where dark magic reigns, nothing is that simple; not dreams, not family, not friendship, and certainly not love.  </p>
<p>Unlike other supernatural teen-romances with their focus on romantic entanglements and high school politics, our show is driven by multiple themes that put life to the test: the tests of choice, loyalty, power, family, friendship, war, and even faith itself. But, the HEART OF ZAHARA is the fact that it's an emotional story about what it means to be BLACK. <i>Black Panther</i> becomes legendary when it stands as more than just a superhero movie, but as a treatise on the African culture; to explore the power and beauty of black people. So, too, will our show celebrate and acknowledge black people and also infuse pride and meaning into what it means to be black.</p>
<p><i>The Vampire Diaries</i>, <i>The Originals</i>, <i>Teen Wolf</i>, and <i>Buffy</i> are all really the same story with similar beats, ageless brooding heartthrobs, troubled young relationships, first loves and the darkness and desperation often associated with vampire myths. So our series too, is an epic (tragic) romance story set in a world where things go bump in the night... But  the STAKES ARE MUCH HIGHER. Or as I’d like to call it, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> meets <i>The Vampire Diaries in Wakanda</i>!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>PREMISE</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622659554/yhasyxbs3rkyn1mg6vca.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>FAMILY IS FOREVER: a promise that the Harris Family, a matriarchal bloodline of powerful BLACK sorcerers called druids, swore to each other in 1856 when they were still the slaves of the Lockharts; a family of flesh eating immortal humans called dhampirs. The Harrises pledged to stand together and fight against their oppressors, successfully setting themselves free from slavery, and retaking Harmony, a town that their ancestors built. Now, almost two centuries have passed and the bonds of the Harris family are about to be broken by tragedy, betrayal, hunger for power, history and a FORBIDDEN ROMANCE.</p>
<h3>BLACK CULTURE </h3>
<p>Our show is, in many ways, a love letter to the black culture. It acknowledges and celebrates everything from African society to the thoughts and frustrations of Black Americans. It explores the power and beauty of black people, and the preservation of their identity. To have a black (female) lead and a majority black cast in a young adult fantasy will be groundbreaking. Our lead character's story is about more than just her forbidden romance, it is representative of the messy and complex vision of black womanhood. I want black women out there to see their lives reflected back at them through her.</p>
<p>Similar to Black Panther, we have characters who still proudly preserve their identities, which, unlike the Harris Family, are not influenced by the Western World. For instance, their natural hair designs will reflect the tribal diversity that draws from the real African black cultures. Black Africans have traditionally been an unsophisticated bit player in American media, often portrayed as backward, savage, and chaotic in everything from news coverage to films. It’s a portrayal that has left little room for other interpretations. This is why our show’s vision is to represent the power and beauty of black people, and infuse meaning and pride into being black.</p>
<p>So really, in addition to escapism and inspiration, our series offers black people the opportunity to reexamine and re-imagine their place in the world, both literally and figuratively. The power of that fantasy is directly linked to prompting challenging “think” pieces that compare a thriving black community that was not colonized to one that has experienced the harsh realities of Colonial America, and has been influenced by the Western world (The Harrises). Zahara will not only be educational and inspirational, it will be a crucial stamp of validation for black people hungry for the opportunity to have their story told. So, really, our audience should look forward to a show filled with raw honesty, breathtaking romance, and real and involving characters that they won’t be able to forget.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>EMPOWERING WOMEN</h3>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622659477/vqhl2yuxdebginurrev6.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p>Zahara is a show that celebrates and empowers women. It’s a show where women accomplish things that the world thinks are unattainable for women; where a female president is not a far-fetched idea. It’s a series that celebrates the female warriors who have tirelessly fought for gender equality as well as paying homage to the women in our own lives who inspire and empower us every day. Our series will be dominated by powerful, game-changing, and non-stereotypical female characters. Through these women, we will explore the dynamics that females can be badass leaders and fall in love too; those ambitions aren't mutually exclusive.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>FRANCHISE POTENTIAL</h3>
<p>After a year of lockdowns and binge-watching, the industry and audiences alike are hungry for new and exciting content. Zahara combines themes and elements from other shows that are proven to be successful: cultural pride of Black Panther, supernatural thrills of Vampire Diaries, timeless forbidden love of Romeo &amp; Juliet, and the intense power struggle akin to Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>Further, there is an enrapturing history full of deep, complicated characters that provides endless opportunities for interwoven, cross-century storylines and multiple seasons worth of plot. And the most important and relevant thing is that it's told through a fresh lens.</p>
<p>It has been said that every story has already been told multiple times over, but what makes them stand out is the storyteller. Zahara is infused with the complex, personal and cultural identity, pain, and beauty of a currently underrepresented community. Canada is ready and wanting to connect with stories from peoples other than the stereotypical representation of a North American - Zahara is ready to deliver.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>WHY THIS SHOW IS IMPORTANT TO US</h3>
<p>First of all, I want to introduce myself, and why I created this show.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622658011/p3hvjrquhtl0u3a0dew1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My name is <a href=""http://www.natashaheschelle.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Natasha Heschélle</a>. I am a Zimbabwean born Canadian actress, writer, producer and dancer. I moved to Canada in 2014 with the dream of being an actress. After years of hard work, I finally got an agent, and as you can imagine, this was a very exciting moment for me. I've always wanted to be TV shows like the vampire diaries, supernatural, the originals etc and getting an agent meant I was a step ahead towards making my dream come true... until my agent told me that I wouldn't be able to audition for the roles I wanted because a) I'm a visible minority and b) I have an accent, and this would work against me especially because, and I quote ""there's a lot of discrimination in the Canadian entertainment industry"".</p>
<p>I was obviously not happy about this, but I refused to let this stop me for chasing my dream. However, after years of trying auditioning and trying to make something out of myself, I realized that my agent was right, I was never going to be cast in the shows that I wanted, or any speaking role for that matter because of my accent. So instead of crying about it, I decided to prove to the world that, even with my accent, I CAN SELL. Everyone CAN SELL regardless of how they look or what they sound like. It's the TALENT that should matter. So, this is why I created Zahara.</p>
<h3>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP</h3>
<p>Our show is a horror, romance drama. We have a great deal of a terrifying and interesting supernatural history, folklore and mythology. So as you can imagine, there will be a lot of special effects, stunts, and of cause, during these trying times, we need to keep everyone onset safe. Producing a HIGH QUALITY show with all these things will be pretty expensive, this is why we are asking you to help us. All contributions go towards renting gear, lights, props, costumes, makeup, blood... and MORE BLOOD. And most importantly, we have to pay our cast and crew.</p>
</div><div><h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h3></div><div><p>Filmmaking is tough. It takes time, dedication and loads of money. With a highly experience cast and crew, we are prepared, we promise to give it all we can and deliver the highest quality content to our audience. </p></div><div>
<h3>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</h3>
<p>We totally understand that not everyone who reads this will be able to make a financial contribution. So, another way you can help us is to share this campaign with as many people as you can. We would greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p>THANK YOU SO SO MUCH for taking the time read this! It means a LOT!</p>

Zahara combines themes and elements from other shows that are proven to be successful: cultural pride of Black Panther, supernatural thrills of Vampire Diaries, timeless forbidden love of Romeo & Juliet, and the intense power struggle akin to Game of Thrones.
Further, there is an enrapturing history full of deep, complicated characters that provides endless opportunities for interwoven, cross-century storylines and multiple seasons worth of plot. And the most important and relevant thing is that it's told through a fresh lens.
It has been said that every story has already been told multiple times over, but what makes them stand out is the storyteller. Zahara is infused with the complex, personal and cultural identity, pain, and beauty of a currently underrepresented community. Canada is ready and wanting to connect with stories from peoples other than the stereotypical representation of a North American - Zahara is ready to deliver.
 
AWARDS AND PRESS

The no budget pitch concept called ZAHARA: THE RETURN was featured in FORBES, won the IPF Pitch Pit competition, and was nominated for Best Digital Series at Blood In the Snow Film Festival, and best low budget series at T.O. Webfest 2020. It is available on Amazon Prime Video USA and UK, Super Channel and Apple TV. 

WHY THIS SHOW IS IMPORTANT TO US
First of all, I want to introduce myself, and why I created this show.

My name is Natasha Heschélle. I am a Zimbabwean born Canadian actress, writer, producer and dancer. I moved to Canada in 2014 with the dream of being an actress. After years of hard work, I finally got an agent, and as you can imagine, this was a very exciting moment for me. I've always wanted to be TV shows like the vampire diaries, supernatural, the originals etc and getting an agent meant I was a step ahead towards making my dream come true... until my agent told me that I wouldn't be able to audition for the roles I wanted because a) I'm a visible minority and b) I have an accent, and this would work against me especially because, and I quote ""there's a lot of discrimination in the Canadian entertainment industry"".
I was obviously not happy about this, but I refused to let this stop me for chasing my dream. However, after years of trying auditioning and trying to make something out of myself, I realized that my agent was right, I was never going to be cast in the shows that I wanted, or any speaking role for that matter because of my accent. So instead of crying about it, I decided to prove to the world that, even with my accent, I CAN SELL. Everyone CAN SELL regardless of how they look or what they sound like. It's the TALENT that should matter. So, this is why I created Zahara.
WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP
Our show is a horror, romance drama. We have a great deal of a terrifying and interesting supernatural history, folklore and mythology. So as you can imagine, there will be a lot of special effects, stunts, and of cause, during these trying times, we need to keep everyone onset safe. Producing a HIGH QUALITY show with all these things will be pretty expensive, this is why we are asking you to help us. All contributions go towards renting gear, lights, props, costumes, makeup, blood... and MORE BLOOD. And most importantly, we have to pay our cast and crew.
RISKS & CHALLENGESFilmmaking is tough. It takes time, dedication and loads of money. With a highly experience cast and crew, we are prepared, we promise to give it all we can and deliver the highest quality content to our audience. 
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
We totally understand that not everyone who reads this will be able to make a financial contribution. So, another way you can help us is to share this campaign with as many people as you can. We would greatly appreciate it.

<h2>Hollywood Hates YOU!!!</h2>
<p>For the last five years Hollywood and the entire entertainment industry has told a certain section of the population to ""go f--k"" themselves. Producers of movies and television have said with the loudest voice,""if you don't agree with me politically or ideology you are a horrible person and I don't want your money"". Celebrities and creative artists have collectively told half the population of the United States of America they don't want your business.</p>

<strong>THE CREATOR</strong><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604437243/rhso6wxvzujaccm5twel.jpg"" src=""""/>
</h3>
<p>Shakira Francis, who is head of film production at The Basement Bunch, originally wrote this 7 part web-series as a homage to one of her favourite American action/thriller's, Set It Off.  The story has since developed with a focused look on friendship, betrayal and the choices that lead to a troubling situation. As well as writing her vision in script format, Shakira will be directing this web-series. Her first directorial debut, 4C, is a short film that was selected as a finalist for the South East Film competition. It then went on to screen at the Cambridge Film Festival, the Brighton Cinecity Festival and toured the South East of England.  Her most recent short film, The Lost Land Girl, was supported by the BFI and is still making appearances in film festivals. Shakira is a returning member of the BFI network x Bafta Crew 2020-21 and wants to use her platform to champion more women ensemble on screen.<br/> </p>

<p>from left to right: Greta Zabulyte (DOP), Charity Muiruri (Alisha), Jessica Layde (Faith), Hannah Kelly (Jess), and Adeyinka Akinrinade (Temi).<br/> </p>
<p>The production of Thick As Thieves prides itself on women collaborating to make compelling work. Our cast and crew consists of people from marginalized ethnic backgrounds who are often stereotyped in film. Representation matters and this campaign is all the more important because it showcases a production with us in the drivers seat, playing and filming mutli-dimensional characters, that are relatable. This industry is steadily changing how it reflects women, Black women and women of colour, on and off screen. This is our contribution.<br/> </p>
<h3><strong>COSTS</strong></h3>
<p>15,000 GBP. That is our crowdfunding goal for Thick As Thieves. This budget will cover the entire production process of all 7 episodes. The funds we previously raised will be used to cover the implementation of Covid-19 health and safety practises (PPE). Please see chart below explaining how we plan to distribute the funds we raise from this campaign:</p>

<p>Ideally we would like to reach our goal however if we don’t raise the entire amount we will change the format of the script and the raised funds will go towards paying for insurance, locations and our cast and crew, outside of The Basement Bunch. Depending on the percentage that we're able to raise from our goal, post production could become in-house only as we think it'd be more ethical for us to pay our collaborators over paying ourselves- though nobody should have to work for free. One of our company values is community and we have a responsibility to uphold standards that communicate our respect for people, their efforts/skills and their time.</p>

<p>Your contribution to our campaign will provide working opportunities to a variety of rising professionals in a period of time that is unprecedented.

Your subscription to us can elevate the belief in upcoming storytellers who see themselves in us.<br/><br/>Thick As Thieves may be a project that is made in Luton but the emotions of the characters and the experiences they face as young adults transcends borders. The women involved in this project are a reflection of the diaspora and some of the stories we tell are connected to many cultural roots, either through the theme or the characters names:<br/><br/>Naca, short film (2016), explores a young Bengali man's conflict between the traditions of his religion and his passion for dance. We won the runner up award for 'best film' at the Fresh Faced Film Festival in 2018.</p>
<p>The Eden Effect, theatre production (2019), Tiffany, Wren and Ashley Nduta are forced to adapt their lives due to the Married Women’s Property Act (Amendment) 2022.

Your subscription to us can elevate the belief in upcoming storytellers who see themselves in us.Thick As Thieves may be a project that is made in Luton but the emotions of the characters and the experiences they face as young adults transcends borders. The women involved in this project are a reflection of the diaspora and some of the stories we tell are connected to many cultural roots, either through the theme or the characters names:Naca, short film (2016), explores a young Bengali man's conflict between the traditions of his religion and his passion for dance. We won the runner up award for 'best film' at the Fresh Faced Film Festival in 2018.
The Eden Effect, theatre production (2019), Tiffany, Wren and Ashley Nduta are forced to adapt their lives due to the Married Women’s Property Act (Amendment) 2022. Biology first, gender second; that’s what they’ve been told. The show sold out in 2/3 of the venues it toured- Camden People's Theatre, The Hat Factory Arts Centre and Curve Theatre. 
RISKS AND CHALLENGES

With filming there are often risks and challenges- from actors falling sick to the English weather being unpredictable however, we are considering all possibilities as we plan ahead to schedule the film shoot. As a collective, we have a wide range of production experience on multiple sets and have dealt with cancellations of locations, clashes of personalities and unforeseen events on set.  We have overcome them and continue to carry this ethic in all our projects, including our web-series; ensuring everything will run on time and on budget.

<h2>WBYI</h2>
<p>What Brings You In? (WBYI) is a comedic web series about famed Dr. William Park (<a href=""https://careernetwork.msu.edu/jobs-internships/interviewing/PARK%20Method.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Park Method</a>) and the various clients he has that come in to his office. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpERSFOOuoI&amp;t=15s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Episode 1: Social Media</a> is out now, to get a feel for the show. </p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""></div>
<h2>WHY WBYI?</h2>
</div><div><p>Because society has created this allusion of everyone living their own life and in turn having their own set of ""first world problems"": Getting likes on Instagram, having the latest iPhone or Yeezys, upset that your favorite fast food place supports a political rival, upset at the series finale of the Bachelor or upset that your yoga spot no longer carries coconut water. We all have that one enormous issue to us thats trivial to the rest of the world.</p></div><div>
<h3>FUNDING</h3>
<p>WBYI is self funded through the full time hours we put in at our day jobs. It costs $400-$700 to film a single episode over the course of 14 hours. This pays key personnel while deferring pay for remaining cast and crew until the episode/series becomes profitable.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>BENEFITS OF WBYI</h3>
<p>What Brings You In? can be stand alone episodes but also follow a procedural order; Much like The Office or Friends. The roadmap for the series allows for many different characters to come on the series whether for 2 or 3 episodes or the entire season. WBYI has also given those new to the industry or interested in certain departments to come on and assist. Want to see what a 2nd AC does? Perfect. Need new reel footage as an actor? We can assist with that. Much like South Park, we also tackle modern issues in a comical way to show how petty it truly can be.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Marty Lindsey and I'm an actor and filmmaker. I play a recurring character (Reese) on AMC's <strong>Better Call Saul. </strong>I've also been on NBC's The Night Shift, El Rey's From Dusk till Dawn, AMC's <strong>PREACHER</strong>, and the feature films <strong>SICARIO</strong> and <strong>OUTLAWS and ANGELS </strong>which premiered at the <strong>SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL</strong> last year. I was also in the sci-fi fantasy hit film INK. I'm from Denver, CO and have lived in Los Angeles, NYC and New Mexico.</li>
<li>
<strong>MENver </strong>is, unequivocally, the epitome of my career, the coup de grace, the manifestation of everything I've done wrong (and somewhat right) in my dating life. So, yeah, I'm stripping myself down (metaphorically) in half-hour <strong>COMEDY PILOT EPISODE</strong> to share the ebbs and flows... mostly ebbs. What are the hardest stories to tell...? These ones! People sludging through the world which revolves around relationships and love. And we're not going to cheese it up. We're going to keep it real. Jason Knauf is the costar of <strong>MENver </strong>and we're both digging deep into our personal lives to pull out the good, bad, ugly... and shocking! Because lets face it, we've all been there... Right?</li>
<li>I've always felt it was my obligation to help bring TV back to Denver. In the late 1980's - early 1990's Viacom had a satellite studio in Denver where shows like Diagnosis Murder and Things To Do In Denver When Your Dead were produced. These teleplays/films employed many local crew, cast and post-production through which bolstering a fragile community ultimately providing a myriad of opportunities for Coloradans to work on a high quality shows. My goal with <strong>MENver</strong> is to bring episodic tv back to this community. Back to COLORADO. </li>
</ul>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>The $30K will be funding the rest of the pilot. This will go to paying for locations, crew, cast, post-production and a venue for the premier which will be at the SIE Film Center in Denver with a second screening at the Chaplin Theater in Los Angeles. You might ask what things cost...? The average Director of Photography makes $800 - $1500 a day. Production Sound makes $600 - $800 a day. Post Production (editor) averages $1000 + a day.  SAG/AFTRA union rates for actors are $600 - $990 a day (I'm a SAG/AFTRA member, this is what I normally make). We'll need Set Designers $500, Hair and Make Up $600, Costume Designers $500, Grips $600, Gaffer $750 (Lighting), this list goes on and adds up incredibly fast. MENver will take seven days to shoot so our budget will be whittled down pretty quick. Now, we cannot pay everyone their normal day rate... so our entire project (everyone) will working for a reduced rate in order to stay under budget.</li>
<li>We have some terrific perks for you! Really, these little tidbits of awesomeness will go long way in making your day/week/month a heck of a lot more fulfilled... like, private Improv classes with Jason Knauf (teacher at VOODOO Comedy Playhouse). Private scene study class with Marty Lindsey (The Process Acting Studio). Personal video messages from Jason &amp; Marty. Special thanks in the credits. Personal foot massage by Jason Knauf. Tics to the red carpet premier and after party. Executive Producer credit. Signed posters by the cast. Signed MENver pilot script. Are you getting excited about the awesomeness yet? I am!</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>MENver </strong>is more than about dating in a town full of men. It's about two guys trying to find themselves... two guys trying to find love. This is essential to all of us. We all need and deserve to be connected to someone in this way no matter your age. We have a great show that examines ideas of identity, self reflection, loss, family, friendship and love. With a comedic undertone to the show we won't pull any punches about how strange it can be to date in your thirties and forties. It's a big idea for anyone at any age.  </li>
<li>I made a movie called SUBURBAN (vuze Audience AWARD WINNER Cinequest Film Festival, San Jose, CA) which examined the life of an ordinary couple living in the suburbs, family dynamics, infidelity, child rearing and letting go of the past. <strong>MENver</strong> has similarities. SUBURBAN had a very successful two week run at the Denver Film Center with subsequent screenings at the MAYAN THEATER and Old Town Cinemas. I'm taking everything I learned from the making of Suburban and pouring into <strong>MENver</strong>. Suburban was a big deal for our production team, for Colorado cinema, we learned a great deal and <strong>MENver </strong>will benefit because of this.</li>
<li>
<strong>MENver</strong> is a pilot. A first episode of what we hope/want/think will be the first episode of many episodes... SEASONS of episodes. That's our plan. Sky is the limit to us. But we have to start somewhere and rock solid beginning is key. This is our deliverable. This is our promise to you.   </li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

We have surrounded ourselves with extremely talented folks in all departments. We have recon. We're ready. Poised. It's time. The biggest challenge in corralling all of this talent (cast &amp; crew) is money. I'm just being real with you. Money solves a lot of issues, but it doesn't take the place of trust.

<p>Dating. It's a peculiar thing. We've all been there. Right? Why is it so awkward? We're all human beings trying to connect. We want to be valued, regarded, loved. But we tend to get in our own way. Why is this? What the hell is going on!? It was easier when we were nine years old and just asked the girl... ""will you go with me?"" Much easier, right?

<p>Hey, I’m Marcus Osborne. For 25 years I had the privilege of working in one of the largest media markets in the country. As a teen-ager, I assumed I’d become a writer for film and television (or an FBI profiler) but for better or worse, I become neither. Nope, instead I ended up going from failed stand-up comic to being a radio and television broadcaster in the San Francisco/Oakland Bay Area. For the next couple of decades, I was afforded the good fortune of a multi-faceted and successful media career. My column, “Straight Male Friend” was published by multiple websites including, Huffington Post, Galtime.com, Yahoo!Shine, and various CBS Radio websites nationwide. I was the Executive Producer and host/cohost/sidekick on a few of the most popular morning radio shows in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>For the better part of 15 years, I reviewed film and some television for for “Sarah and Vinne/Sarah and NoName morning radio show. My on-air partner and I also reviewed film for a couple of local CBS/CBS-owned television affiliates. But that wasn’t all! During that same period, I wrote music/CD reviews for the The Oakland Tribune, reported live from live events including major motion picture film premieres, and awards shows like The Grammys and the Vibe Awards. I was also thrilled to be able to interview celebrities like Denzel Washington, Tom Cruise, Jon Stewart, Jamie Foxx, Jon Mayer, Rob Reiner, Kevin Hart, Simon Pegg, Adam Sandler, Don Cheadle, John Travolta, Billy Bob Thorton, Bruce Willis, and many many more.</p>
<p>I’ve hosted a nationally syndicated radio show, as well as a show for SIRUS XM’s Extreme Talk Channel. Additionally, we launched a popular podcast that ran for 7 years on various platforms. And I loved EVERY. SINGLE. MINUTE. What a run it was.</p>
<p>Two years ago, after I lost a great gig when the station for which I was working was suddenly taken over by a Spanish Language sports network, I was faced with a new quandary; uproot the family and leave the state for another radio gig or change careers altogether.</p>
<p>I chose the latter.</p>
<p>I decided that if I was ever going to bring to fruition, my lofty goal of writing and producing film and television shows, the time would be now. For years, I had written scripts and treatments for film and television, even received a few interested queries from a couple of major production companies, but nothing ever came of those dalliances. The blame being placed squarely on me because I chose not to follow through on those projects, “I could always come back and reconnect with these companies.”</p>
<p>Wrong. How naïve and delusional was I?</p>
<p>But I’ve come a long way since the late nineties. Much more focused and single-minded about what needs to be done to achieve the goal of getting these TV shows and films produced and distributed.</p>
<p>This is where I’m appealing to YOU. No one achieves anything alone. Our goal here is to raise enough capital to produce our very first television pilot, “The Laugh Out Lounge.”</p>
<p>I’ve been inspired by the number of amazing shows in distribution right now. This is truly the Golden Age of quality television. We expect that “Laugh Out Lounge” will be one of your new favorites!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Pilot : ""Laugh Out Lounge""</h3>
<h3>What's the show about?</h3>
<p>A successful, self-absorbed radio host is humiliated when he loses his high-profile radio show and is forced to take a job as a doorman at a comedy club…which leads him to try his hand at a brand new career as a stand-up comic...much to the dismay of his wife.</p>
<p><strong>SERIES SUMMARY </strong></p>
<p>Marc (our lead character) loses his job as a radio host and is forced to take a job well below his qualifications at a comedy club in San Francisco. Over the course of the series, <i><strong>“Laugh Out Lounge”</strong></i> will follow the self-centered celebrity on his journey back to the top…or what he perceives to be the top. Marc's road to redemption takes him through the loss of his job, the loss of his marriage, the reunion with his wife, the death of a friend, career highs, career setbacks and personal tragedy all leading to illuminating self-discovery. He eventually recognizes that his life is far richer when he’s not chasing acceptance through fame but instead, appreciating that the most important things in his life are his relationships with friends and family. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We’re trying to raise at least 12k. What’s that going to cover? The production crew and equipment and the cast for a fifteen-day shoot. And EVERY. SINGLE. PENNY – no matter HOW much we raise will go directly to the production budget for the “Laugh Out Lounge” pilot. Based on our estimates, the amount of $12,000 would be the minimum amount needed to produce a strong pilot.</p>

</div></div>","Hey, I’m Marcus Osborne. For 25 years I had the privilege of working in one of the largest media markets in the country. As a teen-ager, I assumed I’d become a writer for film and television (or an FBI profiler) but for better or worse, I become neither. Nope, instead I ended up going from failed stand-up comic to being a radio and television broadcaster in the San Francisco/Oakland Bay Area. For the next couple of decades, I was afforded the good fortune of a multi-faceted and successful media career. My column, “Straight Male Friend” was published by multiple websites including, Huffington Post, Galtime.com, Yahoo!Shine, and various CBS Radio websites nationwide. I was the Executive Producer and host/cohost/sidekick on a few of the most popular morning radio shows in the Bay Area.
For the better part of 15 years, I reviewed film and some television for for “Sarah and Vinne/Sarah and NoName morning radio show. My on-air partner and I also reviewed film for a couple of local CBS/CBS-owned television affiliates. But that wasn’t all! During that same period, I wrote music/CD reviews for the The Oakland Tribune, reported live from live events including major motion picture film premieres, and awards shows like The Grammys and the Vibe Awards. I was also thrilled to be able to interview celebrities like Denzel Washington, Tom Cruise, Jon Stewart, Jamie Foxx, Jon Mayer, Rob Reiner, Kevin Hart, Simon Pegg, Adam Sandler, Don Cheadle, John Travolta, Billy Bob Thorton, Bruce Willis, and many many more.
I’ve hosted a nationally syndicated radio show, as well as a show for SIRUS XM’s Extreme Talk Channel. Additionally, we launched a popular podcast that ran for 7 years on various platforms. And I loved EVERY. SINGLE. MINUTE. What a run it was.
Two years ago, after I lost a great gig when the station for which I was working was suddenly taken over by a Spanish Language sports network, I was faced with a new quandary; uproot the family and leave the state for another radio gig or change careers altogether.
I chose the latter.
I decided that if I was ever going to bring to fruition, my lofty goal of writing and producing film and television shows, the time would be now. For years, I had written scripts and treatments for film and television, even received a few interested queries from a couple of major production companies, but nothing ever came of those dalliances. The blame being placed squarely on me because I chose not to follow through on those projects, “I could always come back and reconnect with these companies.”
Wrong. How naïve and delusional was I?
But I’ve come a long way since the late nineties. Much more focused and single-minded about what needs to be done to achieve the goal of getting these TV shows and films produced and distributed.
This is where I’m appealing to YOU. No one achieves anything alone. Our goal here is to raise enough capital to produce our very first television pilot, “The Laugh Out Lounge.”
I’ve been inspired by the number of amazing shows in distribution right now. This is truly the Golden Age of quality television. We expect that “Laugh Out Lounge” will be one of your new favorites!

The Pilot : ""Laugh Out Lounge""
What's the show about?
A successful, self-absorbed radio host is humiliated when he loses his high-profile radio show and is forced to take a job as a doorman at a comedy club…which leads him to try his hand at a brand new career as a stand-up comic...much to the dismay of his wife.
SERIES SUMMARY 
Marc (our lead character) loses his job as a radio host and is forced to take a job well below his qualifications at a comedy club in San Francisco. Over the course of the series, “Laugh Out Lounge” will follow the self-centered celebrity on his journey back to the top…or what he perceives to be the top. Marc's road to redemption takes him through the loss of his job, the loss of his marriage, the reunion with his wife, the death of a friend, career highs, career setbacks and personal tragedy all leading to illuminating self-discovery. He eventually recognizes that his life is far richer when he’s not chasing acceptance through fame but instead, appreciating that the most important things in his life are his relationships with friends and family. 
What We Need & What You Get
We’re trying to raise at least 12k. What’s that going to cover? The production crew and equipment and the cast for a fifteen-day shoot. And EVERY. SINGLE. PENNY – no matter HOW much we raise will go directly to the production budget for the “Laugh Out Lounge” pilot. Based on our estimates, the amount of $12,000 would be the minimum amount needed to produce a strong pilot.
Of course, it’s always true that the more capital you have, the greater the opportunity to improve the overall production value and quality, so obviously the more we raise the better it will be for the final product, but we know that this dollar amount will afford us the chance to create a strong, quality TV production.
And even if we DON’T hit our goal, ALL funds raised will STILL be directed towards the production of the “Laugh Out Lounge” pilot, and we’ll attempt to make up the difference in other ways.
So, to encourage your assistance in getting this production completed, we’re offering a few very cool perks! Things like passes to a show at a comedy club, autographed scripts, a gig as a production assistant, all-access visits to the set, speaking roles, passes to the premiere screening and wrap party, and one person or business will get a VERY SPECIAL perk for their VERY SPECIAL donation!

The little boy watching Abbot & Costello movies and “Sanford & Son”, the teen-ager watching “Three’s Company” and “Moonlighting”, the adult glued to the latest episode of  “The Sopranos”, the husband and dad watching “Game Of Thrones,” “The Walking Dead,” “Veep” or “Atlanta” – they’re all me – all a heavy creative influence on the kinds of shows I want to create.
 
All that’s needed now is your help. 
 
And look, there are no guarantees in terms of the show being picked up by a network or streaming service, but we can guarantee a high quality program. We can guarantee that all funds raised will go towards making this the very best production possible.
And for those who can't contribute, but would love to help out, feel free to share our page with your network! Or if you have a specific talent or area of expertise, we're definitely open to volunteers and those who'd like to offer their skills pro bono for the pilot.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Big Picture</h3>
<p><i>Typo Squad</i>  is a 2017 novel written by Amazon bestselling author Stephen Lomer (that's me!), and is set in a world where typos are lethal to 98% of the population.

<p>The novel is very funny, if I do say so myself, and I'm looking to adapt it into a just-as-funny series with an eye toward Netflix.</p>

<h3>About Death's Guardian</h3>
<p>Death’s Guardian is about Victoria Santos, a young women trying to figure out her life while taking care of her ailing father, when she accidentally cheats death and starts seeing a grim reaper type who keeps calling himself her Death Guardian. Now Victoria must earn back her mortality by helping him reap the souls of those her death would’ve affected, all 333 of them.</p>
<p>It’s basically <i>The Good Place</i> meets <i>Dead Like Me. </i></p>
<p>My pilot presentation of this premise will be in the form of a short film where Victoria first learns of her new path and experiences her first “kill”.</p>
<p>I’ve rewritten this script about 14-16 times at this point, digging and prodding at the core motivations of my characters, constructing this crazy world just right while distilling its essence into the short form, but also retaining the most important story beats and emotional peaks. It has been a PROCESS, but a worthwhile one.</p>
<p>This short film is really an expression of my relationship with mourning, loss, and what that leaves us in life. It’s also a conversation on the burdens of our responsibilities and how they can get in the way of what we love and, sometimes, be intertwined with it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This kooky story isn’t just to honor my Aunt Victoria (as you saw in the video) but to also honor the mountain of emotions her life and her passing left me and my family. Death's Guardian is an expression of that sentiment and summarizes the type of stories I want to tell in my career. Stories with strong, complicated, women of color who find themselves in worlds much bigger than their own.</p>
<p>If you enjoy that type of diverse storytelling please consider donating! Any amount helps and we have some really fun perks including grim reaper plush toys, t-shirts, a digital copy of the original soundtrack, and more. </p>
<p>Besides that, you'll have my eternal gratitude. This project means a lot to me and I have so many wonderful people working on it. I want to make sure their efforts aren't for nought. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There's a TON of risk that comes with making a short film on a shoestring budget of 7K. First of all, 99% of my crew are volunteers. Anyone, at any time, could not show up for set. Three of our actors are non-union and could also not show up. The only major consequence for either of these folks is, perhaps, a serious case of feeling like an asshole; but that's pretty voluntary. </p>
<p>That being said, my cast and crew has little to no jerks. They believe in this project as much as I do and I have all the faith in the world everyone will show up and do what they've committed themselves to do. </p>
<p>But, regardless, the show must go on. I have to turn in a thesis by the end of this school year. Death's Guardian will be delivered as a finished product. Your contribution ensures it'll be a product of worth.  All of the money that is received for this film will be used for the film, exclusively.</p>
<h3><strong>Where The Moola Goes</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Production Design: </strong>All of the crazy shenanigans that go down in Death's Guardian will be taking place around Christmas. That's right, folks. Christmas. We're catching some decorations and decor on sale at the moment but could use some help in covering these costs. Victoria's room, her being quite the music lover, will need some loving as well. </p>
<p><strong>Catering &amp; Craft Services: </strong>My trusty, reliable, volunteers/crew members need some love and what better way to express love than to feed them well. With catering costs for 16+ folks going between $150-200 a little boost financially could really make a difference on set. That's not even mentioning crafty. With one meal break, peckishness is a common ""issue"" on set but, surprisingly, it can also set a certain tone. I want to take care of my crew and I want them to feel appreciated. What better way than to give them good snacks and meals. </p>
<p>Happy tummies = happy minds after all. </p>
<p><strong>Location Rentals: </strong>Y'all... Rental rates are rough. We're still hunting for the best location for our sidewalk, living room, front entrance, and hallway (almost there but not quite) but renting a house (working class, worn) for a day ranges from $40-60 an hour and most of our days will range between 10-12 hour. That alone, for one day, one location, will be about $516 -$756 for a day. </p>
<p>Since we're filming one day of filming in a park ($450 location rental) we'll have to pay a $38 hourly rate for a park monitor as well. </p>
<p>As you can see, it's quite an expense, but one that's worth making to bring this world to life as we're envisioning it. The outdoor scenes will be done in South LA, where Victoria lives, and our location will show a realistic portrayal of a working class, Latino, family. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute financially, that's okay. Please share this campaign with family and friends! Do you know of a hook-up? Someone who'd be willing to cater or donate food if we promote their business? DOOOPE. Please contact me. You love this idea and just want to express that with a happy note? Please send it over. I thrive off of encouragement and well wishes. </p>
<p>Seriously, anything helps. Don't be shy. I'm just happy you read this far. </p>

I’ve rewritten this script about 14-16 times at this point, digging and prodding at the core motivations of my characters, constructing this crazy world just right while distilling its essence into the short form, but also retaining the most important story beats and emotional peaks. It has been a PROCESS, but a worthwhile one.
This short film is really an expression of my relationship with mourning, loss, and what that leaves us in life. It’s also a conversation on the burdens of our responsibilities and how they can get in the way of what we love and, sometimes, be intertwined with it.

The Impact
This kooky story isn’t just to honor my Aunt Victoria (as you saw in the video) but to also honor the mountain of emotions her life and her passing left me and my family. Death's Guardian is an expression of that sentiment and summarizes the type of stories I want to tell in my career. Stories with strong, complicated, women of color who find themselves in worlds much bigger than their own.
If you enjoy that type of diverse storytelling please consider donating! Any amount helps and we have some really fun perks including grim reaper plush toys, t-shirts, a digital copy of the original soundtrack, and more. 
Besides that, you'll have my eternal gratitude. This project means a lot to me and I have so many wonderful people working on it. I want to make sure their efforts aren't for nought. 

Risks & Challenges
There's a TON of risk that comes with making a short film on a shoestring budget of 7K. First of all, 99% of my crew are volunteers. Anyone, at any time, could not show up for set. Three of our actors are non-union and could also not show up. The only major consequence for either of these folks is, perhaps, a serious case of feeling like an asshole; but that's pretty voluntary. 
That being said, my cast and crew has little to no jerks. They believe in this project as much as I do and I have all the faith in the world everyone will show up and do what they've committed themselves to do. 
But, regardless, the show must go on. I have to turn in a thesis by the end of this school year. Death's Guardian will be delivered as a finished product. Your contribution ensures it'll be a product of worth.  All of the money that is received for this film will be used for the film, exclusively.
Where The Moola Goes
Production Design: All of the crazy shenanigans that go down in Death's Guardian will be taking place around Christmas. That's right, folks. Christmas. We're catching some decorations and decor on sale at the moment but could use some help in covering these costs. Victoria's room, her being quite the music lover, will need some loving as well. 
Catering & Craft Services: My trusty, reliable, volunteers/crew members need some love and what better way to express love than to feed them well. With catering costs for 16+ folks going between $150-200 a little boost financially could really make a difference on set. That's not even mentioning crafty. With one meal break, peckishness is a common ""issue"" on set but, surprisingly, it can also set a certain tone. I want to take care of my crew and I want them to feel appreciated. What better way than to give them good snacks and meals. 
Happy tummies = happy minds after all. 
Location Rentals: Y'all... Rental rates are rough. We're still hunting for the best location for our sidewalk, living room, front entrance, and hallway (almost there but not quite) but renting a house (working class, worn) for a day ranges from $40-60 an hour and most of our days will range between 10-12 hour. That alone, for one day, one location, will be about $516 -$756 for a day. 
Since we're filming one day of filming in a park ($450 location rental) we'll have to pay a $38 hourly rate for a park monitor as well. 
As you can see, it's quite an expense, but one that's worth making to bring this world to life as we're envisioning it. The outdoor scenes will be done in South LA, where Victoria lives, and our location will show a realistic portrayal of a working class, Latino, family. 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute financially, that's okay. Please share this campaign with family and friends! Do you know of a hook-up? Someone who'd be willing to cater or donate food if we promote their business? DOOOPE. Please contact me. You love this idea and just want to express that with a happy note? Please send it over. I thrive off of encouragement and well wishes. 
Seriously, anything helps. Don't be shy. I'm just happy you read this far.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As a new comedic series, Woof, seeks to entertain the contemporary American audience through the story of a 20 something year old dog walker in New York City. The creators of Woof are avid dog lovers who are looking to partner with local animal shelters to cast dogs for the show who the actors will then introduce in a 45 second tag at the end of each episode. Through this partnership with the local animal shelters, Woof hopes to help the dogs at these shelters to find their forever homes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for $5,000 so that we can buy the highest quality production gear possible (this includes microphones, cameras, booms, etc...), feed our cast, crew, and furry friends while on set, and give our cast and crew a small stipend in return for their hard work. </p>
<p>If you donate to our cause, you will help save shelter dogs lives through helping us to increase awareness of local shelters. Anything you can and are willing to give will help us immensely, but the more you give, the more we give back to you. (More information in ""Perks"" section)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals' website, US animal shelters acquire roughly 6.5 million animals every year. Every year, an average of 1.5 million animals in shelters are euthanized - compared to the 3.2 million animals that get adopted.

</div></div>","Short Summary
As a new comedic series, Woof, seeks to entertain the contemporary American audience through the story of a 20 something year old dog walker in New York City. The creators of Woof are avid dog lovers who are looking to partner with local animal shelters to cast dogs for the show who the actors will then introduce in a 45 second tag at the end of each episode. Through this partnership with the local animal shelters, Woof hopes to help the dogs at these shelters to find their forever homes.

What We Need & What You Get
We are asking for $5,000 so that we can buy the highest quality production gear possible (this includes microphones, cameras, booms, etc...), feed our cast, crew, and furry friends while on set, and give our cast and crew a small stipend in return for their hard work. 
If you donate to our cause, you will help save shelter dogs lives through helping us to increase awareness of local shelters. Anything you can and are willing to give will help us immensely, but the more you give, the more we give back to you. (More information in ""Perks"" section)

The Impact
According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals' website, US animal shelters acquire roughly 6.5 million animals every year. Every year, an average of 1.5 million animals in shelters are euthanized - compared to the 3.2 million animals that get adopted. While it's great and a huge success that nearly double the animals being euthanized are being adopted, it's not enough. Woof hopes to partner with local animal shelters in New York and use the dogs as cast members and at the end of each episode, we will feature an animal shelter a a dog in need of adoption. The hope is that this will help increase foot traffic at the shelters and, in turn, increase adoption. 

Risks & Challenges
We already have one animal shelter totally on board with this project. Others are very interested in supporting us by word of mouth. Our main goal with this project is to promote these dogs who are in need of forever homes - but we want to do it through a well produced series. The funding from this campaign will help take our project from just a cool idea to a beautiful web series that will change lives forever.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>     I'm David K Jarreau, director and filmmaker.  I just completed my last short film Unit 68, with a budget of 18,000  to great reviews from several premieres. I'm an inspirational short film writer and I love to tell stories about my experiences and observations in life. I believe that as a storyteller, you must be true to yourself when writing your stories. That means that you should never be afraid to explore any theme or concept if it means something special to you, even at the risk of being misunderstood by your peers.</p>
<p>My latest film Rise is a case in point. </p>
<p>     This film could be my most important work to date. It is admittedly disturbing, unsettling uncomfortable, unpleasant and at times comedic .  In RISE, we explore what justice would look like in the eyes of the victim. Justice in its true raw form that never truly restores what was lost but at the very least seeks to to balance the scales in some meaningful way. </p>
<p>     I came up with the idea of RISE several years back while watching news stories of ISIS when they were on the move taking over cities and raping and killing the local women in the most horrific ways. They were given carte blanche to do whatever they wanted in the most evil ways imaginable.  The worst part of all perhaps, is that many were never brought to justice for their actions and will never pay for their crimes in this life. We know they will however pay for their crimes in the life to come. So the question I ask is, ""what would their justice look like it it were repaid back in this life""? That's what RISE explores. </p>
<p>    True raw justice is not about unforgiveness or even retribution, although to some it may be.  It's not even about settling the score. It's about paying for the crime committed in the most equal way possible, simply put-the administration of fairness.</p>
<p>     RISE is set in modern day Syria and stars three beautiful Black Ops soldiers, Gem, Minx and Diamond who are assigned to torture if need be, extract information and kill if necessary ISIS soldiers convicted of sex crimes and murder. The main character is Gem, a beautiful but deadly, highly intelligent, no nonsense special operations soldier who has no conscious when it come to following orders to torture and kill. She uses her beauty and charm mixed with her tough exterior to get what she wants. Gem was molested as a teen by her step dad shortly after her real father was killed in action in an Army combat mission. She always regarded her real father as a true example of a father and hero.  From that point on, she held a special contempt in her heart for abusers of women.  She joined the ARMY after high school and quickly rose through the ranks  soon becoming involved in Special Ops overseas. This is where her contempt was given an outlet. She responded to an offer to deal with sex crimes offenders in Syria.  She joined her best ARMY friend Minx and Diamond in Syria to organize and run Black Site 3. A holding area for convicted sex criminals are awaiting their sentencing.  Although originally from the US, GEM, MINX and DIAMOND officially joined the Syrian army to train and create a special paramilitary group called R.I.S.E. It's an acronym that stands for each members specialized skills. Reconnaissance, Interrogation, Surveillance and Execution. It also stands for the female gender RISING against those who would persecute and abuse and even murder her. Just for being female. Also it refers to the rise Gem and Minx will look for to determine if each ISIS soldier will walk free or be terminated.</p>
<p>     In the story, Gem, Minx and Diamond are on a much needed vacation headed to an airstrip where they are interrupted by a sat phone call from Command. They are ordered to cancel their vacation plans and head directly back to Black Site 3 where three high value ISIS convicts are awaiting their fate.   This totally derails the immediate plans for Gem, Minx and Diamond but they have to do what they are ordered.  On the way back to Black Site 3 while being driven by Diamond, Gem sees a baby doll on the side of the road, triggering a flashback to when she was molested by her step dad.  As she comes out of the flashback, she is reminded of why she does what she does and has a renewed fervor for her purpose. </p>
<p>     At Black Site 3, the three ISIS convicts await their fate from Gem and Minx.  One of Gem's gifts is to mix mind games with her captives punishment.  Knowing that she was ordered to execute the convicts, she offers them a bargain they can't pass up.  A choice to die at her and Minx's hands or to walk out free men.  Being that the ISIS soldiers used sex as a weapon to kill and torture, Gem and Minx will use sex as a weapon back at them in their final day. Gem's mind game is that she and Minx will set a timer for 15 minutes and attempt to arouse the ISIS soldiers by any means. If they can withstand the temptation, they go free. If they give in, they die.  The climax of this film is to see who lives and who dies. And is justice served? Will they make it past 15 minutes?</p>
<h3> </h3>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $12,000 to fully fund RISE,  This will cover Actors and Crew salaries over two and a half shooting days, craft services, insurance and film permits as well as props and sfx.  All shooting locations have been negotiated free of charge.</p>
<p>For every contribution, over $25 you will receive an autographed script and a DVD as well as credit. If you contribute 25 per cent or more, you will receive associate producer status.</p>
<p>If we don't reach all the funds, we will contribute what we have the the shooting budget. Will will continue to save for the total till we are able to shoot the whole movie.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As I share the story of RISE with selected people, its amazing how many people are supportive of the message even with it's controversial content. It's also amazing at the number of women who have been honest with me and told me of their experiences at the hand of abusers. They see RISE as an outlet, a voice for their innermost feelings. So I think by getting involved with this film, you are actually helping to bring a long silenced voice to many women who have searched for justice when there was none.</p>
<p>     I'm certain that we can produce a very professional film with this budget.  I just successfully produced a short with a similar budget and put together an amazing team of very skilled people. I'll do exactly the same for RISE.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> I realize that there will be a few risks in making this film. For starters, it's a very unpleasant subject to tackle. We are depicting the administration of justice in an uncensored way. Some people will find this repulsive. Some people will welcome it and believe it's long over due. I'm creating the film with my team with boldness and letting the audience decide if something they can relate to. At the very least it will stimulate an interesting discussion.  I'm going to release this film no matter what and let it take a life of it's own. It's the only way to see what becomes of it. </div><div>

We need $12,000 to fully fund RISE,  This will cover Actors and Crew salaries over two and a half shooting days, craft services, insurance and film permits as well as props and sfx.  All shooting locations have been negotiated free of charge.
For every contribution, over $25 you will receive an autographed script and a DVD as well as credit. If you contribute 25 per cent or more, you will receive associate producer status.
If we don't reach all the funds, we will contribute what we have the the shooting budget. Will will continue to save for the total till we are able to shoot the whole movie.

The Impact
As I share the story of RISE with selected people, its amazing how many people are supportive of the message even with it's controversial content. It's also amazing at the number of women who have been honest with me and told me of their experiences at the hand of abusers. They see RISE as an outlet, a voice for their innermost feelings. So I think by getting involved with this film, you are actually helping to bring a long silenced voice to many women who have searched for justice when there was none.
     I'm certain that we can produce a very professional film with this budget.  I just successfully produced a short with a similar budget and put together an amazing team of very skilled people. I'll do exactly the same for RISE.

Risks & Challenges I realize that there will be a few risks in making this film. For starters, it's a very unpleasant subject to tackle. We are depicting the administration of justice in an uncensored way. Some people will find this repulsive. Some people will welcome it and believe it's long over due. I'm creating the film with my team with boldness and letting the audience decide if something they can relate to. At the very least it will stimulate an interesting discussion.  I'm going to release this film no matter what and let it take a life of it's own. It's the only way to see what becomes of it.

During post-production, the marketing campaign will be executed. Sooo... what happens if the goal isn’t reached?The crowdfund campaign for Nim is a flexible funding campaign, which means that if we do not reach our target goal, we will still receive the funds that were raised. Even though it will make Nim the little witch sad, we will still move forward with production with the first episode if that is all we can do. We will then release the first episode and use that to help us fund the remaining episodes.What about the pandemic???Great News!! Unlike many other productions, Nim won't be affected by the pandemic since majority of the work will be done remotely. So even if there is another major lockdown, Nim will still be able to come to life!Risks & ChallengesWe’re employing a trademark lawyer to assist us with the legal processes and the creator, Kimberly Palmer, will be the legal owner of the animation so there won't be any issues with cease & desist from any third party.The main risk involved in making Nim is schedule. If the crowdfund succeeds, our team would be able to dedicate more time to the cartoon (in most of our cases, even making it our full-time job), which would help reduce schedule slipping. There’s always the risk of something unexpected and outside of our control slowing the production, but such possibilities become remote once we have funding to work with.I love Nim but can't donate. How else can I help?Even if you can’t donate, spreading the word about the crowdfund campaign helps too! - Indiegogo has provided some easy-sharing tools which you can use to do so.Remember, the more the word spreads about the campaign, the more likely is that we reach our crowdfund goal and the faster we can begin the production process! However, please be courteous when spreading the word. We want people to -LOVE- the campaign, not hate it. While telling all your friends, or people in your favorite forum helps to get eyes on the campaign, spamming the topic or being rude about it will have the opposite effect.Thanks to everyone pledging to the crowdfund, spreading the word, supporting us and in general being awesome. We wouldn’t be here without you.We still have a way to go, though, so let’s make this happen!",27.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>On his first mission as a newly recruited MI5 agent, Tom is assigned to retrieve a target called Andrew Dalton. In a fight for his life, Tom takes a brutal smack to the head causing him to momentarily lose his memory, and permanently lose some valuable Intel. Sophie, another MI5 agent, is on hand to help Tom when he needs it most, but a much larger threat has kidnapped Tom for killing Dalton, and the only person with a lead to Tom is the one he’s grown quite close to: Sophie. Events quickly take a turn for the worst as two terrorists break out of Belmarsh prison, leaving Tom, Sophie, and two MI6 Agents to find them before they act.</p>
<p>The cultivation of this project has been many years in the making, the vision of a six part web series however, has been a singular goal for the last year. The journey mapped out for this project has presented us with exciting plans in the near future, plans that will not be possible without the generosity and enthusiasm, displayed in your contributions.</p>
<p>While we have been blessed in the past with a group of dedicated and talented group of core cast and crew on previous projects, Discretion is a project in which we would like to take to the next level. The next level we speak of is to work with a higher profiled cast and crew, and that means we need money for their efforts. The breakdown of these disbursements will be sufficiently outlined later in the campaign.</p>

In his words, the experience literally “changed his life”.

Blake and his two best friends, Ian and AJ, got to work writing that very show! We decided to call it <i>Timberwood</i>. And when it was all done, after months of hard work and endless writing sessions, we looked down at the hundreds of pieces of paper, turned to each other, and asked, now what? How do we actually go out and make this thing we just wrote? (We didn't actually print them for no reason, that would be wasteful).</p><p>The traditional way to do it would be to try to sell the scripts in Hollywood.

Thanks for watching, we really appreciate it! If you haven’t watched it yet, go ahead and click play on the video at the top of the page...Can you believe we shot that episode completely independently last summer? We did it all. Wrote it. Produced it. Directed it. Edited it. Starred in it. Everything.  We even put our money where our mouth is. Big time. Our director put up 150K of his own money to make the first episode! And since he didn't have it in cash, he did it by selling his house...Now we want to make the rest of the first season for you to enjoy. Here’s the plan: You pre-order the first season of the show now, just like you might have anyway, and we use that money to fund the production of the rest of the episodes! Not only are you supporting the show by buying the first season, but you’re also helping fund it at the same time! And without you, there will only ever be this one episode. With your help we can shoot the whole first season of Timberwood this spring and send it to you as soon as it’s done!If we raise $500,000 or more, we’ll be able to shoot a six-episode first season. But $500,000 is the bare minimum. The more we raise, the more episodes we can shoot and the better the show will be!We’ve got so many great scripts written and we want to share them all! Visiting Day, Colour War, an Inter-Camp Roller Hockey Tournament, could Maricia actually exist? With the help of our fans, we’ll be able to raise the money we need and get this show made!We know that $500,000 sounds like a lot of money. And really, it IS a lot of money. But when we’re talking about producing an ENTIRE SEASON of a TV show, this is a TINY budget. Look at the average cost to produce ONE episode of some of your favourite shows:Back in the early 2000’s our director, Blake, worked as a counselor at a summer camp in upstate New York. In his words, the experience literally “changed his life”. Since then he’s wanted to make a fun, hilarious show that captures the actual experience he and so many other campers and counselors had.Sure there have been other shows and movies about summer camp - satirical and goofy versions, camper point-of-view versions, versions where everyone gets (spoiler alert) murdered at the end, and even a version where 45-year-old Paul Rudd plays a 16 year old (I mean, he is pretty charming).But to us, there’s never been a show that’s captured what it’s really like to work at a summer camp in an authentic way. That’s our goal – to tell a coming of age story set at summer camp in the tradition of Superbad or Dazed and Confused. Fast-forward from the early 2000s to two years ago. Blake and his two best friends, Ian and AJ, got to work writing that very show! We decided to call it Timberwood. And when it was all done, after months of hard work and endless writing sessions, we looked down at the hundreds of pieces of paper, turned to each other, and asked, now what? How do we actually go out and make this thing we just wrote? (We didn't actually print them for no reason, that would be wasteful).The traditional way to do it would be to try to sell the scripts in Hollywood. The only problem with that is when someone does buy the scripts they definitely wouldn’t let us make the show we want to make, or the way we want to make it (mostly because we aren’t JJ Abrams or The Rock - although Ian did have a very brief/pathetic wrestling career).Looking at it closer, producing this show independently meant we could do a whole episode for a fraction of what it would take a Hollywood production – mostly because we can work with a way smaller crew and be way more efficient as a result.Then the unthinkable happened. Blake decided to sell his house - yes, he sold his actual house! - to raise enough money for us to spend a week up in the Catskills last August shooting the first episode! That’s the one you just watched for free!Now we want to finish what we started and tell the rest of the story. But Blake doesn’t have any more houses to sell, so we need your help! If you liked the pilot episode of Timberwood and you want to see more, you can directly be a part of making it happen and join us on this adventure! When else do you get to become a producer for $10?Apart from pre-ordering the first season, there’s all sorts of other ways you can be a part of Timberwood, with plenty of fun perks to go along with your contribution, from T-shirts and a Counselor’s Essentials Kit to VIP Tickets to the premiere in NYC or even getting to be an extra on the show!Everything is at the top on the right hand side of the page. And if you want to sell your house like Blake did, we’ll accept that too! Every single dollar we raise will go entirely into making the show about camp you've always wanted. And because we’re doing this completely independently, every dollar really does make a huge difference. It’s not going into Venti Skinny Soy-based Pumpkin Spice Lattes or a travelling gym for Blake to work out  in (he's put on a few), it’s going directly into camera and lighting rentals, paying our small professional cast and crew, and making sure there’s enough mac n' cheese for lunch. And if one dollar makes a difference, you can imagine what $20 can do! Remember, the minimum we need is $500,000, but the more we raise, the better this show will be and the more episodes we can shoot.(Although Ian did a brief a stint as a rodeo clown) We've been guerrilla filmmakers working with small and non-existent budgets for years. One of the last films Blake produced went to Sundance, AJ won a Canadian Comedy Award (and Canadians are funny!), Ian is a graduate of the famous Second City and UCB's comedy schools and even ghostwrote jokes for a famous comedian (whose name he can't say due to an NDA).  All together, our projects have accumulated millions of views on YouTube, and we're used to making mountains out of molehill budgets. Combined with great actors from some of your favourite shows like The Vampire Diaries, House of Cards, Homeland, Mr. Robot, Scream, Chicago Fire, Scream, Reign, and many more, Timberwood is where indie meets Hollywood. An accomplished indie team with experienced Hollywood talent. As you saw in the pilot, this perfect merger will give you great production value for a fraction of the cost!  Time to use the power of the internet and make a TV show come to life, together!Even if you’re not able to contribute financially, the more people who see this, the better chance we have in raising the money we need. The pilot is FREE! So get your friends to watch it! Make some noise on social media. Put it on your Instagram stories! Put a link on your Facebook page! Tweet about it!

<h3>What are we up to? </h3>
<p>We are a team committed to changing the way you react to and interact with the news. We want to raise the level of debate around the issues because information is everywhere and its important to be able to discern fact from fiction and to make an argument based on evidence and not simply conjecture or supposition. </p>
<p>We live in a world where the structure of broadcasting is more blurred than ever. A single individual is now capable of informing the masses, right or wrong. News organizations are now more biased than ever. When there are those who peddle in misinformation or push a narrow-minded narrative there must be those who just as fervently fight to maintain the truth.</p>
<p>We want to bring you stories about the national issues and raise the level of debate around the conversations that we have about them. We want to focus on local issues and how they tie into the larger national narrative. We will do this by conducting investigative profiles, interviews and discussion panels, debates and focus groups with subject matter experts, prominent figures, politicians and voters across the country.</p>
<p>Your contributions will allow us to start this journey on the East Coast, starting in the DC, Maryland, Virginia (DMV) area by purchasing the equipment we will need to produce high quality content for you. We will then branch out to other locations, continuing our goal of exploring national issues from a local perspective and raising the level of debate around these conversations. Our goal is to eventually make our way to your city! </p>
<p>We believe that all politics is local and so is the news that informs that politics. We think that getting back to the grassroots and highlighting issues and ongoing efforts to deal with them at the local level will better inform our conversations about them in the larger context of their national character. </p>
<p>One thing every American can agree on is that we love this country dearly. In a time when it seems there is little else to find common ground on, its important to take a deep breath and not forget where we came from and how far we can go together. Rhetor is about finding our common ground, our common purpose and our common voice. We hope you'll support our campaign! </p>

<h3>Who I am, why this campaign, how big your help will be</h3>
<p>My name comes from being born on February 12, Abraham Lincoln's birthday. I am proud of that because of what Lincoln meant to America. Further, I was born the year John F. Kennedy became president, which was also 100 years after the start of the civil war.</p>
<p>As a first generation American, I have great respect, admiration, appreciation and love for the country. It is an organic entity that has shown the ability of a country to improve itself. So this campaign is intended to try to bring 'sense' to the misguided behavior that has crept into US sports via one football player. Your support will help arrest a veritable 'cancer' in America and redirect the 'well-intentioned portion of the message' to be more properly carried out.</p>
<p>I am an accountant, professor, author, father, husband, Christian, process-improvement professional.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are aiming here for $5,000.</p>
<ul>
<li>A part will go to a very capable local production company that is presently performing for ""credit"" and a hopeful backend. That company is <a href=""http://www.pressureentertainment.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.saguarofilms.com</a>. A portion will go to a cast of over 15 actors and actresses. The scriptwriting team, rental of locations, insurance during filming, marketing costs and other operational expenses will bring the total all-in cost of the production to over $15,000. Your support would defray that cost by 33%.</li>
<li>We are offering FREE gavels and US flags for just ""liking"" our stuff. For nominal contributions, we will supply ""The Head Coach"" episode upon completion. We have completed episodes before. This is why you should not worry this will be completed. To that point, other episodes presently available on Amazon, will be offered here for big discounts from the Amazon price. And for exceptional, big contributors we offer behind-the-scenes fun plus all the other perks to boot!</li>
<li>If we do not reach our goal, the funds will go first to secure the production team. Because without that company, nothing will get delivered. Second, funds would go to retain the comedian and other cast we need. Third, funds would go to locations and other costs necessary to see this show is delivered for the good of America.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The episodes we have delivered to date speak to compelling American topics. The American motto ""In God We Trust,"" pugilism and safety in sports, commitment in relationships and women's rights are topics dramatized so far. </p>
<p>Citizen behavior is critical in a country of 320 million, that allows the level of freedom allowed in America. Certain actions can work to undermine the intended fabric of the country. </p>
<p>The main point with this episode is - if there is a problem, it is more advisable to use the ""right"" tool(s) to address the problem versus the ""wrong"" one(s.) </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Ideally this American episode needs to be completed by February 2018, before the end of the football season. Beyond that, it needs to be completed before April 2018 to hopefully avert a spread of the ‘fire’ to baseball. Nevertheless, even if it gets delivered later than hoped, it will speak to sports in general. The bigger risk is the episode never getting completed and the misguided actions begun by one player going unchallenged intellectually and logically.</p>
<p>We want to provide quality similar to shows previously produced, so production costs are largely unavoidable. We also want to utilize the highest acting talent we will have employed to date.  Cast is critical to delivering the message as well.</p>
<p>We will find a way to get the episode produced. The main risk is how quickly we can deliver this needed opening of dialogue to America.</p>

The main point with this episode is - if there is a problem, it is more advisable to use the ""right"" tool(s) to address the problem versus the ""wrong"" one(s.) 

Risks & Challenges
Ideally this American episode needs to be completed by February 2018, before the end of the football season. Beyond that, it needs to be completed before April 2018 to hopefully avert a spread of the ‘fire’ to baseball. Nevertheless, even if it gets delivered later than hoped, it will speak to sports in general. The bigger risk is the episode never getting completed and the misguided actions begun by one player going unchallenged intellectually and logically.
We want to provide quality similar to shows previously produced, so production costs are largely unavoidable. We also want to utilize the highest acting talent we will have employed to date.  Cast is critical to delivering the message as well.
We will find a way to get the episode produced. The main risk is how quickly we can deliver this needed opening of dialogue to America.

<h3>Short Stem Summary</h3>
<p>Our passion is simple, we really want to do what we love, and make you laugh while we do it! </p>
<ul>
<li>I'm Natasha Kradnikov and I have built up my following on Instagram to over 19K followers and  I want to make more people laugh than anything in the world! So I hope you enjoyed the video and wish for the same. I am Russian and work with only the best in the industry to make quality content for not only the fun of being creative, but also to be entertaining. </li>
<li>We all love to create, if you donate to the campaign... We will be able to do just that! Imagine with the shoestring budget we made this skit on, how much more we can do with a budget! We want to smell good and it takes good pollinators to make us smell good, so pollinate our rose bush! &lt;3</li>
<li>You will help us create content that could make people laugh that have never before laughed! Can you imagine never laughing in your life? We had one guy test out the video and he laughed and had to watch it twice. He is now addicted to laughing. I would say that's a really good goal in life, to make people laugh passionately! </li>
</ul>
<p>We need your help to make this dream of all of ours happen and we sure hope you're on board! Don't want to miss out on the adventure we're about to have! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All the Bush trimmings: </p>
<ul>
<li>Essentially the $500 minimum we have on here is to pay the actors that have already trusted and believe in us enough to contribute to the making of the video you just watched! Our next goal is to continue to make more videos and to grow the online presence of Natasha (Be sure to follow her on IG, Facebook &amp; TikTok @NatashaKradnikov on Twitter @NatashaKRussian) but, with an even higher rate of quality and comedy than you have already witnessed. For every $500 we raise, we can pretty much make another video. We have so many other things planned for Natasha in the future and look forward to consistently raising the bar for comedy. We even have a feature film in the long run, but that's down the road.</li>
<li>We're going to have some really cool (possibly borderline narcissistic) Perks in place for you. You just have to keep reading! </li>
<li>We know we can count on you to reach our goal and hopefully even exceed it! But, if not it just means the actors and crew get paid a little less. But, you know what happens when the crew gets hungry? They don't like to work... So it's essential we do reach the goal!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Rosey Bushes: </p>
<ul>
<li>Let's be real... We all love to laugh, (Last I checked, I really do anyway) and this may not be for everyone, but there are a lot of folks that will love this humor. We hope you're one of them! </li>
<li>I can only point to the success of my Instagram in terms of being a content creator and influencer, but on my youtube channel I love to do tutorials on things. (Yes, I really can fix cars!)</li>
<li>I've been around Los Angeles for almost 5 years now and I don't intend to leave. I have worked so hard to be here and have convinced other people to kind of join the journey with me. Please don't let them down! I have been in a few movies, done some voiceover, acted in shorts, worked my butt off (which doesn't seem to actually be leaving me...) to be here. The impact you have on society will be awesome. We have other plans for helping give back to our community in place for the future, but we need your help to get the first stretch of the plan going. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The ultimate risk is not getting anything... And that really gripes my Rose Bush! So I will say per any crowdfunding campaign, we just want to create a fun journey with you including us into your life. </p>
<ul>
<li>We have teamed up with some other renowned filmmakers and content creators that have yet to be disclosed to protect their privacy. (they know what they're doing, we checked them out. Plus we're not too bad ourselves!) </li>
<li>We have strategies in place that no matter what, we will continue to make awesome content. It just might mean lighter on equipment or locations or the opposite depending on the amount we get. We will adjust our budget accordingly, but we will always make the most with what we're given. That's a promise we can keep! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know everyone sometimes can't even afford to donate a dollar, and that's okay! It is even more helpful to share this project with your friends if you believe in it and want to see us make more for you to enjoy. </p>

<li>If you have media outlets that would love to share our content, please feel free to put them in touch with us. We are very media friendly. </li>
<li>Please use all tools available to you to share and help us make this campaign and video go viral. </li>

<i><strong>The Verdict</strong></i> - One Hour Serialized Crime Drama</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Following a brutal attack from a police officer, a once vibrant, now hardened young woman stops at nothing to put her perpetrator behind bars during an on going court case, while she simultaneously works to uncover the truth about her news station and their suspicious police dealings. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Created and written by <strong>Cecily Vaughn</strong>, who is also a Los Angeles based actress, <i><strong>The Verdict</strong></i> is intended to be packaged and sold to a streaming platform or network with named talent attached.</p>

Following a brutal attack from a police officer, a once vibrant, now hardened young woman stops at nothing to put her perpetrator behind bars during an on going court case, while she simultaneously works to uncover the truth about her news station and their suspicious police dealings. 
Created and written by Cecily Vaughn, who is also a Los Angeles based actress, The Verdict is intended to be packaged and sold to a streaming platform or network with named talent attached.
The Verdict has spent the last two years in development. After countless hours of writing and rewriting, the pilot as well as the story bible are now complete. The last thing this series needs for the pitch package is a ​Proof of Concept.

<h3><u>What is Marked: Story of a Scar?</u></h3>
<p>Two tattoo artists compete to design a unique tattoo inspired by the impactful stories behind the scars on everyday people they meet with.  The winning artist earns the right to “mark” the person with a tattoo design that incorporates the scar and immortalizes their story, while the loser endures a mark... of shame.</p>
<p>Our Goal is to produce an 8 episode season of the show.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>Detail Summary</u></h3>
<p>Marked - Story of a Scar, created by Dylan Ben-Israel, is a reality tattoo show like no other. In each episode, every day people marked with scars from experiences in their lives, sit down with two world class tattoo artists and share the stories behind the scars. Some scars are from injuries, some from surgeries, some from beating the odds of a disease, some from self harm, some from an abusive past, some from being a hero and some from doing something stupid.  </p>
<p>The two artists ask questions and listen, as the people recount their experiences and stories behind the scar, before retreating to their design areas and creating a custom tattoo inspired by the personal stories they heard.</p>
<p>Once both artists have completed their design, the person chooses which sketch best represents their unique experience and the winning artist gets to “mark” them. </p>
<p>The overall result is a fun and hopefully cathartic experience for the person and the artist. By telling their story and having that story permanently etched onto their skin, not only do they get to immortalize one of the most important times in their life but they get to close that chapter, and as their new tattoo heals, so do they.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>Message from the Creator</u></h3>
<p>People get tattooed for numerous reasons. Some for honor, some for beauty, some for inspiration and some for celebration… but all of them to remember something or somebody in their lives. But there is another group who get tattoos for the exact opposite reason and that is to cover up a scar that they have… something they want to forget.</p>
<p>On this version of the reality tattoo show Marked, our tattoo artists will compete to design a tattoo that integrates or covers up the scar that haunts someone, and with it, hopefully help them heal and move forward in some way. I created the show originally as a way of letting people share stories that impacted them and made them who they are today… and sometimes by sharing these stories, it helps the healing process move forward. </p>
<p>So please donate and help us make another season of this great show and help us share it with the world. If you can’t support us with money, then spreading the word is equally as valuable. Whether it’s telling a friend, a family member, or sharing it on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin, Reddit, Tik Tok, Clubhouse or any of the other social media sites, we appreciate the shout out… we’re passionate about getting another season made and every penny helps towards the goal of getting these stories out to the world.</p>

Two tattoo artists compete to design a unique tattoo inspired by the impactful stories behind the scars on everyday people they meet with.  The winning artist earns the right to “mark” the person with a tattoo design that incorporates the scar and immortalizes their story, while the loser endures a mark... of shame.
Our Goal is to produce an 8 episode season of the show.

Marked - Story of a Scar, created by Dylan Ben-Israel, is a reality tattoo show like no other. In each episode, every day people marked with scars from experiences in their lives, sit down with two world class tattoo artists and share the stories behind the scars. Some scars are from injuries, some from surgeries, some from beating the odds of a disease, some from self harm, some from an abusive past, some from being a hero and some from doing something stupid.

Once both artists have completed their design, the person chooses which sketch best represents their unique experience and the winning artist gets to “mark” them. 
The overall result is a fun and hopefully cathartic experience for the person and the artist. By telling their story and having that story permanently etched onto their skin, not only do they get to immortalize one of the most important times in their life but they get to close that chapter, and as their new tattoo heals, so do they.
 
Message from the Creator
People get tattooed for numerous reasons. Some for honor, some for beauty, some for inspiration and some for celebration… but all of them to remember something or somebody in their lives. But there is another group who get tattoos for the exact opposite reason and that is to cover up a scar that they have… something they want to forget.
On this version of the reality tattoo show Marked, our tattoo artists will compete to design a tattoo that integrates or covers up the scar that haunts someone, and with it, hopefully help them heal and move forward in some way. I created the show originally as a way of letting people share stories that impacted them and made them who they are today… and sometimes by sharing these stories, it helps the healing process move forward. 
So please donate and help us make another season of this great show and help us share it with the world. If you can’t support us with money, then spreading the word is equally as valuable.

The Pitch: The Participant meets up with the 2 Artists again, this time to see both designs and hear what inspired each artist to draw what they came up with.

The Choice: After hearing both of the artists pitch their tattoo designs, the Participant selects who the winning artist is and the tattoo they want to get Marked on their body.

The Tattoo: The winning artist and the Participant go into the tattoo booth where the artist marks the Participant with the tattoo of their choice, while sharing more stories with one another. 

The Reveal: The artist reveals the finished tattoo to the Participant, hoping that this has been a cathartic experience for them by helping them immortalize one of the most important times in their life… and as their new tattoo heals, so do they.
The Wheel: The winning tattoo artist earned the right to ink the Participant while the loser must spin the Wheel of Shame and face the punishment that lands on.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Luke Burge, I'm an Actor, and first time Director and Writer.<br/><br/>Having a huge passion for this project, I'm really hoping to get it off the ground to expand my career, as I would very much like to direct and act in my own films.<br/>The Dead and Us is very much inspired by The Walking Dead, and apocalyptic style stories in general; I'm hoping to branch off the project into something unique.<br/><br/>I've brought together a brilliant cast, whom are all fired up and ready to go, along with a dedicated crew who are very excited bring this series to life.<br/>This project is so important to me and especially with how it will be made, I plan to produce it where the story is most important, it will be gripping and well told, characters will develop through emotional factors, and the unexpected can and <i><strong>will </strong></i>happen.<br/>New ideas throughout the story will be told in ways you wouldn't begin to imagine.<br/>There's endless ideas for this short series and we want this to be the best it can be.<br/>Not only can we make this happen, but you can as well!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Super Insurance is a vlog style comedy that follows the life of Micah Barnett as he tries to prove how important his job is. He's... an insurance agent. But not your regular insurance guy, Micah works for a company that specializes in damages done by superheros and villains. He believes wholeheartedly that his job is crucial to the work that the supers do and will do everything in his power to make sure its done correctly.</p>
<p>Super Insurance has just announced that ""a certain billionaire super hero"" (*cough* Iron Man *cough*) is offering two VIP passes, along with a private tour of his lab, to the agent that process the most claims by the end of the quarter as a thank you for all of their hard work. As a self proclaimed super fan, Micah HAS TO WIN.  Follow Micah and his cubicle mate/best friend, Riley, as they take on every crazy call and dangerous plan to get those tickets. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This webeseries is created by three life long friends, myself (Sharon), Liv, and Tray. We have always loved theater and creating stories and have found that the internet is a perfect place to combine the two. We believe that representation is important and are working towards creating projects that show diverse characters and situations. All types of people should be seen in media and it is our jobs as creators to help make that happen. This project is the first in many to come and we hope that with your continued support we can tell wonderful stories.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for $3500 to produce season 1 (19 episodes). All of the funds raised will go towards equipment, set, costume/props, post production editing, travel expenses/actor pay, and any Indigogo fees. </p>
<p>Equipment: $1000 - New camera, audio, lights, monitors, etc </p>
<p>Set: $500 - Rent for location as well as funding to build cubicle walls </p>
<p>Costume/Props: $300 - cast costumes as well as back ups for when things get messy (they are going to get pretty messy)</p>
<p>Post Production: $700 - editors, animation, and marketing</p>
<p>Travel/Actor Pay: $500 - We would like to be able to give our actors a bit of pay as well as some travel stipend for those that need to travel. Thankfully it is a small cast and the majority live close by! </p>
<p>Indiegogo Fees: $500 - This will give us a safety net for any fees that Indiegogo takes out. Any money left from this budget (after fees) will go towards Travel and Actor Pay</p>
<p>All funds will go to the creation of this webseries. If we do not meet our goal than any money raised will be used for these items in order of importance. </p>
<p>FOR YOUR DONATION: </p>
<p>We are offering perks for donation levels! Every level will get its perk as well as the perks for the levels before it. </p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our goal with everything we make is to show positive representation in any and every way that we can. We need more things created by people of color, women, and LGBTQ creators and our group checks all of those boxes. We want to show that we all have stories to tell and that no one culture or person fits neatly into a box. This show is just the first of many and we hope that you will help us make it a reality. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our largest challenge is funding. We all come from humble beginnings and work every day to make ends meet. This means that we don't really have extra money to put towards the things we want to create. It's through amazing donors like you that we can overcome that hurdle. </p>
<p>This show is also being created by people that live across the nation from each other. Liv and Tray live in North Carolina and I live in Las Vegas. While this is a challenge, we all work well together and through long chats, video calls, and emails we have been able to get things moving! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone can donate to projects that they love or want to see, but by sharing our campaign or just telling your friends about us and what we are trying to create can be a HUGE help! Please share as many places you can and tell as many people as you can about our little project! </p>

<p>At it's heart, the Project is an 90s style horror serial that follows four women as they are recruited into a secret organization that hunts down and kills demonic and other supernatural threats.  At it's heart, the show is a suspense series, but has more than its share of humor and drama. It follows those involved in the Project as they learn and grow as characters.  You won't find those perfect, all powerful characters that plague cinema and TV today.  These characters are all flawed and have a lot to learn.  </p>

<h3>Decades in the making</h3>
<p>In 1991, director Brett William Mauser began writing a series of screenplays that were based around the same characters, places and events.  For ten years, he continued to grow this cinematic universe creating low budget films with his VHS and Hi8 cameras.  Then in 2002, Mauser took the first step into a larger world with ""The Knight Watchmen,"" his first serious effort into commercial filmmaking. Over the next ten years he would helm the Ponderous Universe that would see 35 feature films produced, all taking place in the same cinematic world.  The ""Universe' climaxed with the ten feature film epic, ""The Innocence Saga.""</p>
<p>While the films were extremely low budget, some made with less than $150, the production team of Ponderous Productions honed their skills and learned the secret to making films with little to no money. After Mauser returned to complete his BA and MA at Texas A&amp;M University - Corpus Christ, he learned the ""right way"" to produce films, but he still saw the wasted time and money and was able to combine his new found professional knowledge with his experience in making films with no money and founded Not So Sane Entertainment.</p>
<p>Through all of this, Mauser slowly found more and more success. Films like ""Barrio Angelz"" turned a profit and reached international audiences, while projects like ""Serial Rabbit III"" hit Netflix and gained popularity and eventually cult status.  More recently, his films ""Blow A Kiss"" and ""Serial Rabbit V"" have reached even greater audiences through Amazon and Amazon Prime. </p>
<p>Now Brett Mauser and his team are revisiting the old Ponderous films, but with a new professional and experienced outlook.  Having realized that the stories and themes of the old films were powerful and endearing, he also realized that it was the wrong format to present them. So he started from scratch and rewrote the entire Ponderous Universe into 2 - five season episodic series.  The first fo which is, ""The Project.""</p>
<p>What makes these series different is not just what goes on behind the camera, but the material itself.  While the series is aimed and designed for contemporary audiences, unafraid of tackling controversial and current topics while maintaining adult content, it also attacks these from a more conservative and traditional voice, which presents alternative viewpoints and ideas that are not typically seen in today's television and film world.</p>
<p>The world in which these characters live and breath may be one of fantasy, where vampires and demons lurk in the shadows, but it also approaches it from a more scientific and realistic perspective, one in which a 110 pound woman is not capable of sending a 350 pound mercenary flying through the air with a front flying kick.  While it is a fantasy world, it must still abide by the laws of physics.</p>

<h3>Who wants to be in Super Bowl 2021?</h3>
<p>The Super Bowl. It's the biggest advertising event of the year, viewed by over 100 million people. But getting an ad spot during the big game has ever only been available to the biggest and richest companies. Until now!  My idea is a simple one. I want to give anyone with just 25 dollars the opportunity to be seen on the biggest stage. Have a small business to promote? Let's do it. Looking for an over the top proposal to your girlfriend? She'll love it. Want more Instagram followers? Sure, that works too. Just want to show off how sweet your ride/family/barn/whatever is to nearly every person in the country? Done. Let's make advertising history as the first crowd-funded and crowd-sourced Super Bowl ad. All it takes is $25 to get in the game! #inthegame</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Today our country feels so divided. Divided along political, economic, generational, racial and ethnic lines. Yet, our country's motto for centuries has been ""E pluribus unum"", ""Out of many, one"". From many states come the United States, from many walks of life and backgrounds come the people of  those United States. Watching the Super Bowl feels like one of the last events that still brings us all together as a country. That is why I chose it to create something that unites us all by showcasing our diversity, celebrating our differences and highlighting what brings the many together as one nation, indivisible.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>So, Super Bowl ads are crazy expensive (30 seconds~$6 million!) and I'm just a guy with a day job that can't afford to lose $$$ making this happen. I'm mostly in this to do something big and fun that brings a lot of people together. I set the goal to (hopefully) at least break even after taxes, fundraising fees and overhead costs on a 15 second ad. If we go over the goal, we'll buy more ad time. If it doesn't work for any reason, everyone gets their money back. So please share this page with everyone you know! As an added bonus, use the Indiegogo referral tools to refer your friends and I will give $50 in credit towards one perk of your choice for every $1000 referred (must be logged into account and use share tools). </p>
<p>Each perk level provides a different size ad space and time on the screen during the commercial. If you contribute more you get more, either more time, more space, or both. For each $25 pledge, a backer will receive 25 characters for a name or message that will briefly show during the credits.  A $40 pledge (limited quantity) gets a 50x50 pixel space to advertise whatever they want (within reason, see the rules) for 2 frames (that's 1/12th of a second). That will look like this.</p>
<p><strong><i>$40 perk @ 1/12 second (limited quantity)</i></strong></p>
<p> <img alt=""$40 perk"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/i86ClAk.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You catch that? If you missed it, don't worry. At the end of the ad there will be a website address where you and the rest of the world can go watch and re-watch the ad frame-by-frame, as many times as you would like. You can also easily record it on your DVR and play it back frame-by-frame on your big screen TV to make sure she caught that proposal.</p>
<p>Too small? Then you can move up to 100x100 pixels. Here are the four possible perks in this size. </p>
<p><strong><i>$100 perk @ 1/12 second (limited quantity)</i></strong></p>
<p> <img alt=""$150 perk"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/ZTG2Kac.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong><i>$450 perk @ 1/4 second</i></strong></p>
<p> <img alt=""$150 perk"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/MNtJG8q.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong><i>$850 perk @ 1/2 second</i></strong></p>
<p> <img alt=""$150 perk"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/hl3fL9f.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong><i>$1,700 perk @ 1 second</i></strong></p>
<p> <img alt=""$150 perk"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/f3lZatY.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If that still isn't enough, then you can move up to larger sizes. Here are the 200 x 200 through 400 x 400 sizes at 12 frames (1/2 second).</p>
<p><strong><i>$3,500 perk - 200 x 200 @ 1/2 second</i></strong></p>
<p> <img alt=""$150 perk"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/Fj36JCg.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>$7,500 perk - 300 x 300 @ 1/2 second</i></strong></p>
<p> <img alt=""$150 perk"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/5zn8UUO.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>$14,000 perk - 400 x 400 @ 1/2 second</i></strong></p>
<p> <img alt=""$150 perk"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/6y2LEu7.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>And there you have all the possible sizes and amounts of time you can be on screen with your personalized spot. All other perks are just different combinations of those sizes and screen times (if you would like a different size/time on screen, contact me and I will add a perk).</p>
<p>Now you might still be wondering what the heck all of this will actually look like on game day. Well, that all ultimately depends on you, my backers, but I did mock up this 15 second version of what it might looks like. Ready? OK, but It's a little crazy...</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Can you imagine seeing that come on your big screen after the tenth beer commercial of the night? Since it will be like nothing anyone has seen, I expect it to generate a lot of buzz and immediate traffic to the website (in-the-game.com). That's a lot more free exposure for everyone's ad. The website will also include a grid system and frame by frame navigation to make it easy for anybody to find the exact grid cell and timestamp of any advertisement. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>So, what's the plan?</h3>
<p>If we do make our funding goal, here is my five-point plan for getting all this done:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>February-March:</strong> Meet some cool Indiegogo people and hit the funding goal. Yay!</li>
<li>
<strong>March-April:</strong> Build website and collect all images from backers.</li>
<li>
<strong>May-June:</strong> Engage an advertising team to create final commercial and purchase airtime from CBS.</li>
<li>
<strong>July-September:</strong> Review final advertisement with CBS's standards and practices department and make any necessary changes.</li>
<li>
<strong>October-January:</strong> Inform all backers of the location and frames where their reward will appear on the screen. </li>
<li>
<strong>February 7th, 2021:</strong> Collapse on my couch, crack open a beer, and enjoy the game!</li>
</ul>
</div><div><ul></ul></div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, if for any reason at all this doesn't work, I will be refunding everyone's money less any expenses incurred in the production of the commercial (if any). These expenses will be deducted proportionately from the amount contributed. So the overall risk to you the backers is low. </p>
<p>The first risk is that honestly, I’ve never done anything like this before. I'm not a ""Mad Man"". But I'm not going to let that stop us. I'm a professionally successful and know first-hand what it takes to get a large project like this across the finish line. I also know when to call in the pros, so I've budgeted enough money to hire professionals to put the final product together and purchase the ad spot from CBS. </p>
<p>The other risk I've identified is clearing the ad through CBS's standards and practices department given that it is going to have thousands of images and will be unlike anything they've ever seen. So, I've built a lot of lead time into the schedule to allow the network to thoroughly vet and accept the ad. If for some reason the ad is initially rejected, I will work closely with the network to make any reasonable changes. </p>
<p>Finally, it is possible that some people's perk just won't fit into the overall ad. In this case, ads will be included in the order that the pledge was made within each perk level (so pledge early!). Anyone not included will receive a full reimbursement of their pledge amount.</p>
<h3>Rules (Important Stuff)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Backer must provide an image in a standard electronic format (jpeg, gif, png) and of sufficient quality/size within a month of the close of the fundraising campaign. </li>
<li>The subject matter of all images must be appropriate for broadcast television.</li>
<li>The backer must hold the copyright to all submitted images and indemnifies me and holds me harmless for any copyright infringement claim that may result from the use of aforementioned images. </li>
<li>The placement and timing of all images will be determined by me, and the exact location and frames of the images will be communicated prior to the air date.</li>
<li>Reward descriptions assume a standard 1080p commercial shot at 24 frames per second. If the final video is at a different resolution or speed then the reward may need to be slightly modified, but I will try to get as close as possible. Ads may also be slightly resized to make them fit in the display size.   </li>
<li>I reserve the right to refuse images for any reason. If the image is not displayed in the ad, then the backer will receive a full refund.</li>
<li>Let's follow all the rules and make this fun and easy for all!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Any pledge amount brings us one step closer to making this a reality. Help me make it happen by clicking the ‘Back This Project’ button at the top of the page, or by helping us spread the word by sharing this page and using the #inthegame hashtag to spread the word. Don't forget to use the Indiegogo referral tools and I will give $50 in credit towards one perk of your choice for every $1000 referred (must be logged into account and use share tools). THANK YOU for helping make this happen!</p>
</div></div>","Who wants to be in Super Bowl 2021?
The Super Bowl. It's the biggest advertising event of the year, viewed by over 100 million people. But getting an ad spot during the big game has ever only been available to the biggest and richest companies. Until now!  My idea is a simple one. I want to give anyone with just 25 dollars the opportunity to be seen on the biggest stage. Have a small business to promote? Let's do it. Looking for an over the top proposal to your girlfriend? She'll love it. Want more Instagram followers? Sure, that works too. Just want to show off how sweet your ride/family/barn/whatever is to nearly every person in the country? Done. Let's make advertising history as the first crowd-funded and crowd-sourced Super Bowl ad. All it takes is $25 to get in the game! #inthegame
 

The Impact
Today our country feels so divided. Divided along political, economic, generational, racial and ethnic lines. Yet, our country's motto for centuries has been ""E pluribus unum"", ""Out of many, one"". From many states come the United States, from many walks of life and backgrounds come the people of  those United States. Watching the Super Bowl feels like one of the last events that still brings us all together as a country. That is why I chose it to create something that unites us all by showcasing our diversity, celebrating our differences and highlighting what brings the many together as one nation, indivisible.
 
How it works
So, Super Bowl ads are crazy expensive (30 seconds~$6 million!) and I'm just a guy with a day job that can't afford to lose $$$ making this happen. I'm mostly in this to do something big and fun that brings a lot of people together. I set the goal to (hopefully) at least break even after taxes, fundraising fees and overhead costs on a 15 second ad. If we go over the goal, we'll buy more ad time. If it doesn't work for any reason, everyone gets their money back. So please share this page with everyone you know! As an added bonus, use the Indiegogo referral tools to refer your friends and I will give $50 in credit towards one perk of your choice for every $1000 referred (must be logged into account and use share tools). 
Each perk level provides a different size ad space and time on the screen during the commercial. If you contribute more you get more, either more time, more space, or both. For each $25 pledge, a backer will receive 25 characters for a name or message that will briefly show during the credits.  A $40 pledge (limited quantity) gets a 50x50 pixel space to advertise whatever they want (within reason, see the rules) for 2 frames (that's 1/12th of a second). That will look like this.
$40 perk @ 1/12 second (limited quantity)
 
You catch that? If you missed it, don't worry. At the end of the ad there will be a website address where you and the rest of the world can go watch and re-watch the ad frame-by-frame, as many times as you would like. You can also easily record it on your DVR and play it back frame-by-frame on your big screen TV to make sure she caught that proposal.
Too small? Then you can move up to 100x100 pixels. Here are the four possible perks in this size. 
$100 perk @ 1/12 second (limited quantity)
 
$450 perk @ 1/4 second
 
$850 perk @ 1/2 second
 
$1,700 perk @ 1 second
 
If that still isn't enough, then you can move up to larger sizes. Here are the 200 x 200 through 400 x 400 sizes at 12 frames (1/2 second).
$3,500 perk - 200 x 200 @ 1/2 second
 
 
$7,500 perk - 300 x 300 @ 1/2 second
 
 
$14,000 perk - 400 x 400 @ 1/2 second
 
 
And there you have all the possible sizes and amounts of time you can be on screen with your personalized spot. All other perks are just different combinations of those sizes and screen times (if you would like a different size/time on screen, contact me and I will add a perk).
Now you might still be wondering what the heck all of this will actually look like on game day. Well, that all ultimately depends on you, my backers, but I did mock up this 15 second version of what it might looks like. Ready? OK, but It's a little crazy...
 

 
Can you imagine seeing that come on your big screen after the tenth beer commercial of the night? Since it will be like nothing anyone has seen, I expect it to generate a lot of buzz and immediate traffic to the website (in-the-game.com). That's a lot more free exposure for everyone's ad. The website will also include a grid system and frame by frame navigation to make it easy for anybody to find the exact grid cell and timestamp of any advertisement. 
 
So, what's the plan?
If we do make our funding goal, here is my five-point plan for getting all this done:


February-March: Meet some cool Indiegogo people and hit the funding goal. Yay!

March-April: Build website and collect all images from backers.

May-June: Engage an advertising team to create final commercial and purchase airtime from CBS.

July-September: Review final advertisement with CBS's standards and practices department and make any necessary changes.

October-January: Inform all backers of the location and frames where their reward will appear on the screen. 

February 7th, 2021: Collapse on my couch, crack open a beer, and enjoy the game!


 
Risks & Challenges
As mentioned above, if for any reason at all this doesn't work, I will be refunding everyone's money less any expenses incurred in the production of the commercial (if any). These expenses will be deducted proportionately from the amount contributed. So the overall risk to you the backers is low. 
The first risk is that honestly, I’ve never done anything like this before. I'm not a ""Mad Man"". But I'm not going to let that stop us. I'm a professionally successful and know first-hand what it takes to get a large project like this across the finish line. I also know when to call in the pros, so I've budgeted enough money to hire professionals to put the final product together and purchase the ad spot from CBS. 
The other risk I've identified is clearing the ad through CBS's standards and practices department given that it is going to have thousands of images and will be unlike anything they've ever seen. So, I've built a lot of lead time into the schedule to allow the network to thoroughly vet and accept the ad. If for some reason the ad is initially rejected, I will work closely with the network to make any reasonable changes. 
Finally, it is possible that some people's perk just won't fit into the overall ad. In this case, ads will be included in the order that the pledge was made within each perk level (so pledge early!). Anyone not included will receive a full reimbursement of their pledge amount.
Rules (Important Stuff)

Backer must provide an image in a standard electronic format (jpeg, gif, png) and of sufficient quality/size within a month of the close of the fundraising campaign.

Ads may also be slightly resized to make them fit in the display size.   
I reserve the right to refuse images for any reason. If the image is not displayed in the ad, then the backer will receive a full refund.

Producing a high-production-value television show is an expensive task and to continuously push the limits of what is possible in agricultural TV we need an additional $99,000 from individual sponsors like you! 
We'll be offering various levels of perks, ranging from access to special coverage of our production and insight into the farmers' lives to the possibility to be on the show yourself!
If we don't reach our entire goal, we will still be able to utilize this money to make Season 4 of Corn Warriors better than ever before! 


The Impact

Corn Warriors provides a unique perspective on the lives of some of the most productive farmers in the world.
We offer insight into American agricultural life, innovative farming techniques, and the struggles and triumphs of the American farmer. 
So far we have had three highly successful seasons, all of which are available to watch free of charge on YouTube and Amazon Prime. We want to continue to provide this entertainment and information to farmers and agriculture enthusiasts all over the world. 


Risks & Challenges
This will be our toughest season yet, as we have huge plans to increase the production value and scope of our project. 

Our team has over 50 years of combined experience in film and television production and we strive to be on the cutting edge of media creation. 
As the risks for the farmers get bigger, they do for us. 
We're in this together with the agricultural community, and we will face the coming struggles from weather, the economy, and unforeseen circumstances with a fighting spirit and a drive to entertain and educate farmers everywhere.

<p><strong>L.Y.F.E. is REAL!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Welcome To The Good L.Y.F.E.</strong></p>
<p>My name is Jerail Fennell, and I am the creator of L.Y.F.E., a YouTube Series that I created during the Global Coronavirus Pandemic. I wanted to tell an authentic story about four college students trying to maneuver through Love. Youth. Freedom. and Education.  If you're a college graduate, current college student, or just someone making your way through L.Y.F.E. as well, this show will hit home with you! </p>
<p>Our campaign is simple. We are seeking to raise funds to complete season one of L.Y.F.E. If you loved episode one, then you are in for the ride of your life. During season one, we touch on important topics surrounding us today, including the BLM movement, #MeToo, Depression in College, Consent, Sexual Relations, Domestic Violence, and much more. We have eight episodes of L.Y.F.E. written and two filmed. </p>
<p>Your contribution will allow us to tell this coming of age story that needs to be told. There is some story that will resinate with you in some way. You will also be supporting a group of  black actors, writers, and directors. No amount is too small, really. </p>
<p><strong>Let's Talk Turkey. </strong></p>
<p>So, where would the money be going? I'm happy you asked: </p>
<p>Funding will go solely to the production of L.Y.F.E. which includes, equipment, locations, actors, support staff. Up to this point, I have funded the project out of my own pocket, and have also got a few investors for future episodes, but there is always room for more.  </p>
<p>What do you get for being an investor of L.Y.F.E.? Let's talk about perks: </p>
<p>First Look At All New Episodes - We all like to be first, right? </p>
<p>Extras including behind the scenes and outtakes</p>
<p>L.Y.F.E. T-Shirt ($50 or more)</p>
<p>Personal video messages from the cast and producers </p>
<p>Early release of the Season 2 Premiere </p>
<p>Sponsorship of an episode ($100 or more) </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>I understand that everyone isn't in the position the contribute monetarily; I get it! But there are many other ways you can help! </p>
<p>You have social media? Share the series and tell everyone how good it is. You can also share the link from this page to others who may be interested in contributing. </p>
<p>That's all there is to it.</p>

People have always told me I have this unique blend of charisma that motivates and inspires. I am a natural entertainer, and more importantly, I try and give back to my fellow communities as much as possible. I need your help! </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the last few years I have been slowly building up a home studio that will allow me to deliver the most unique and professional streaming experience ever. I have accomplished so much and met so many wonderful new friends from all over the globe, the journey has been nothing short of fantastic. This campaign will help me finalize the studio with the most expensive and equally important backbone of the studio, the PC RIG itself. <br/><br/>Currently, I run everything through a steam machine,a low end unit, its out run it's use. I am currently experiences issues and crashes as it struggles to keep up with all the programs running when i hit the go live button. It has had a good run as a beginners set up. Unfortunately, I have outgrown it rather quickly, and the specs are un-upgradeable. I need a pC i can grow with, upgrade as needed, and that will last me for a solid few years.  </p>
<p>I have offered what I think is some fairly unique and fun perks, most of which are connected to my digital content and shows. I am growing on mixer very fast, and I offer unique experience for those interested in potentially testing the waters, or just want to have a fun time with my amazing community. </p>
<p>If we do not reach the entire fun, the money will be set aside as i continue to receive donations from my streams and through patreon. Whether or not we reach the goal or not, every dollar pledged will be spent on the RIG. The more we make, the stronger the RIG will be built.  </p>

I have accomplished so much and met so many wonderful new friends from all over the globe, the journey has been nothing short of fantastic. This campaign will help me finalize the studio with the most expensive and equally important backbone of the studio, the PC RIG itself. Currently, I run everything through a steam machine,a low end unit, its out run it's use. I am currently experiences issues and crashes as it struggles to keep up with all the programs running when i hit the go live button. It has had a good run as a beginners set up. Unfortunately, I have outgrown it rather quickly, and the specs are un-upgradeable. I need a pC i can grow with, upgrade as needed, and that will last me for a solid few years.  
I have offered what I think is some fairly unique and fun perks, most of which are connected to my digital content and shows. I am growing on mixer very fast, and I offer unique experience for those interested in potentially testing the waters, or just want to have a fun time with my amazing community. 
If we do not reach the entire fun, the money will be set aside as i continue to receive donations from my streams and through patreon. Whether or not we reach the goal or not, every dollar pledged will be spent on the RIG. The more we make, the stronger the RIG will be built.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are the MorphinTokuSociety, a coalition of ranger fans who hope to bring a new light and scope to the power ranger fandom. Each of our members are authors of their own individual ranger teams who've joined together to build a whole new universe. This project has been a dream for many of our members.</p>
<p>By joining us with this campaign you'd be following us as we explore this new and unknown dungeon. New stories will be told based on the ones we all know and love.</p>
<p>Questions that were left ambiguous will finally be answered.</p>
<p>The first step in getting to all the good stuff is laying the ground work. Power Rangers Ancient Age is the first of our series and will essentially take the place of the 30th anniversary. Ancient Age has a starting team of 6 rangers and are mentored by none other than Jason Lee Scott. They draw their powers from the ancient gods of Egypt who have taken up residence in the the bodies of our 6 protagonists. Through out their journey we encounter many archaic threats such as other demons, monsters, and gods. We also get to see many familiar faces along the way all of whom impart wisdom to the Ancient Age team.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're hoping to accumulate roughly 50k or less. All funds will be poured directly into key areas of the the project primarily in terms of equipment and software. Another crucial area would be in securing familiar voices in the ranger fandom. Imagine not only seeing your favorite characters but actually hearing them. There have been talk with having ACTUAL TV RANGERS voicing their character so that will be a plus. We also need help in getting singers and composers in order to draft music for future sound tracks. We need help also securing sound designers and vfx artists. We hope to give you the best experience possible, one that will not easily be forgotten.</p>
<p>If we don't meet our full funding, what we receive will be put into the animation software as we continue to negotiate with TV actors.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project was once produced as an online story which received stellar reviews by fans stating that this was something much needed. A group of fans went on to draft a petition to make this project a reality and now here we are. We aim to expand Power Rangers Ancient Age beyond just the written narrative as it was originally but to now add the long awaited visual aspect. By contributing to this project and joining to make this dream a reality you will be supporting the hope of a much needed change in the grand narrative of Power Rangers.</p>
<p>One notable lack in the fandom is acknowledgment of he impact of the first Red Ranger Jason Lee Scott. In our story we expand more on his character making him a father and delving more into his past as a ranger. He too has a connection to Egypt all of which led to his eventual becoming of the red and gold rangers</p>
<p>There was so many questions left unanswered, as well as too many unrealistic situations. This story hoped to give answers and add a degree of realism that fans of all ages can enjoy.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We understand that the goal we set may seem a bit far fetched, however that will not deter us from striving to get all we can. Every single penny will be put to use, none of it will be wasted.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Fairfield Boys Mini Series</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Brief Synopsis</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In the backwoods of the old west, two brother outlaws (The Fairfield Boys), are hunted by a skilled bounty hunter out for his own kind of justice. Inescapably the brother's lives are intertwined with two unsuspecting runaways, changing all of their lives forever. From the rights and the wrongs, to the twists and the turns, they discover the bonds of family among thieves in this five part mini-series set in the old west. Filmed entirely against the scenic Oregon landscape.</p>
<p><strong><i>Episode 1 ""Rough Times""</i></strong><br/>Morgan and Clive find themselves engaged in a shootout in the remote hills with a deadly hunter. When Abigail stumbles upon one of the survivors, her and her brother must nurse the stranger back to health and make a difficult decision.</p>
<p><i><strong>Episode 2 ""Blood and Vengeance""</strong></i><br/>Abigail and Zeke arrive at the lake with their battered survivor in tow, but a night meant for rest and recuperation, turns violent. As the trio is ambushed, another wounded victim is added to the list, forcing the three to seek aid at a nearby farm.</p>
<p><i><strong>Episode 3 ""Our True Enemy""</strong></i><br/>The true enemy is revealed as old ties reconnect. Once considered enemies become allies and new revelations come to light. A harrowing loss reveals the truth that will lead our troupe back to town and back into the throngs of a past better forgotten.</p>
<p><i><strong>Episode 4 ""Back In Town""</strong></i><br/>The hard truth is faced, as backwoods meets civilization. With hope dwindling and little makings of a plan or advantage, the troupe returns to face demons of old. A corrupt town will offer little aid to the outcasts, but a stand needs to be made even with the threat of a noose in sight.</p>
<p><i><strong>Episode 5 ""Redemption""</strong></i><br/>The final stand is made and all is revealed. As the Sheriff and his Deputies vie for power in town, the streets run red with blood. Abigail and her allies fight against corruption and injustice as they look for redemption at the end of their long road.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Out West</h3>
<p>Some of the best westerns made were mini series. Take <i>Lonesome Dove</i> and Larry McMurtry's further series <i>Streets of Laredo, Dead Man's Walk</i> and <i>Comanche Moon</i>. Then there were the History Channels popular <i>Hatfields &amp; McCoys</i> and <i>Texas Rising</i>. Of course there have been countless westerns throughout the years, ranging from the black and white Roy Rogers and Errol Flynn movies to today's <i>Dances With Wolves, Hostiles</i> and <i>The Magnificent Seven</i> (remake of the original). Of course I would be remiss if I did not include John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. All of these are shot against beautiful landscapes and are full of thrilling adventure and stories of survival, during a time that was rough and gritty. What better place to film a western than right here in Oregon (home to the Oregon Trail)? Why not tell a gritty story of survival, hope, redemption and love? Well, that right there is what we are aimn' to do!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Production</h3>
<p><u><strong>Location</strong></u><br/>Oregon is the perfect place to make a film! We want the scenic backdrops of Oregon to serve as a character in our film. Just as the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>Hobbit</i> trilogies used the sprawling landscapes of New Zealand as a character in their storytelling, we are looking to do the same here. We start by filming our first episode on privately owned property, that we have been granted permission to use, in Cottage Grove Oregon. Cottage Grove already has a name in the film industry, being the place that Buster Keaton's <i>The General</i> was filmed. Other recent films that have utilized locations in Cottage Grove include <i>Stand By Me, Animal House</i> and <i>Emperor of the North</i>. Oregon has also been named one of the best places to live and work as a moviemaker.</p>
<p><u><strong>Time Period</strong></u><br/>The series is set around the mid to late 1860's. During this period of time there was an influx of settlers to the Pacific Northwest due to the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850, a federal statute enacted by the Congress of the United States to promote homestead settlement in the Oregon Territory. It permitted settlers on unsurveyed lands to select claims without regard to legal subdivisions. This is where our outlaw brother's have gotten a name for themselves by robbing the influx of settlers. Now being that it is a period piece we will be looking to match details in props and costumes of the time period, to add authenticity to the production.</p>
<p><u><strong>Funding</strong></u><br/>Our primary purpose for raising funds is as follows:</p>
<p>A. Cast &amp; Crew - About 80% of our funding. The budget goal we have set here is for Episode 1 alone (beyond that we will need to continue to raise funds as the series progresses).</p>
<p>B. Authenticity - 15% goes into props, costumes and makeup. In order to make this something we can all be proud of, and to retain a certain amount of historical accuracy, we will need to create some costumes and rent others. As well as prop and firearm rental, or procurement.</p>
<p>C. Housing, Travel and Food - 5% to keep our folks fed and happy. In order to film against the beautiful landscapes of Oregon, much of our cast and crew will be required to travel to location. While we will look to carpool and open up our homes as much as we can to cut down on budgetary spending, a certain amount will be needed to keep our hardworking team happy and healthy.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Making An Impact</h3>
<p><i><strong>Actors &amp; Artists</strong></i><br/>Many of us spend much of our time traveling to and from one project (theatrical/film) or another on a voluntary basis. We are actors and artists trying to make a living doing what we love, but many productions pay little to nothing. Our schedules and finances consist of jumping from one project to the next and sweating the whole time, because of the low pay and sacrifice. Here we have the chance to provide work for Oregon artists through 5 episodes. This will equate to several years of regular work for many Oregon filmmaker's and artist. But heck! We are not just looking to employ from our State only, we would love to expand, but this is just the jumping off point.</p>
<p><i><strong>A Good Story</strong></i><br/>We want the story we tell here to have an impact. Why tell a story unless it is worth telling? I find that historical, or historically based stories have such an impact. Why? Because they are about real people and they really happened. Moreover, a story that elicits  emotion can change the way we think and the way we are. To cry with someone, or for someone or to feel empathy, tragedy, or any course of emotion is informing us and moreover forming us into people, better people, that feel and think. We are not telling a story just to tell a story.</p>
<p><i><strong>Bringing History to Life</strong></i><br/>Research. While not an actual historical recount of people and happenings, the story does delve into the history of the 1860's and the people and locations around it. Think of the Netflix's show <i>Stranger Things</i>, nothing historical about it other than the time period and settings. And then <i>Downton Abbey</i>, while somewhat more historically based, still a work of fiction.</p>

The Fairfield Boys Mini Series
Brief Synopsis
In the backwoods of the old west, two brother outlaws (The Fairfield Boys), are hunted by a skilled bounty hunter out for his own kind of justice. Inescapably the brother's lives are intertwined with two unsuspecting runaways, changing all of their lives forever. From the rights and the wrongs, to the twists and the turns, they discover the bonds of family among thieves in this five part mini-series set in the old west. Filmed entirely against the scenic Oregon landscape.
Episode 1 ""Rough Times""Morgan and Clive find themselves engaged in a shootout in the remote hills with a deadly hunter. When Abigail stumbles upon one of the survivors, her and her brother must nurse the stranger back to health and make a difficult decision.
Episode 2 ""Blood and Vengeance""Abigail and Zeke arrive at the lake with their battered survivor in tow, but a night meant for rest and recuperation, turns violent. As the trio is ambushed, another wounded victim is added to the list, forcing the three to seek aid at a nearby farm.
Episode 3 ""Our True Enemy""The true enemy is revealed as old ties reconnect. Once considered enemies become allies and new revelations come to light. A harrowing loss reveals the truth that will lead our troupe back to town and back into the throngs of a past better forgotten.
Episode 4 ""Back In Town""The hard truth is faced, as backwoods meets civilization. With hope dwindling and little makings of a plan or advantage, the troupe returns to face demons of old. A corrupt town will offer little aid to the outcasts, but a stand needs to be made even with the threat of a noose in sight.
Episode 5 ""Redemption""The final stand is made and all is revealed. As the Sheriff and his Deputies vie for power in town, the streets run red with blood. Abigail and her allies fight against corruption and injustice as they look for redemption at the end of their long road.
 
Out West
Some of the best westerns made were mini series. Take Lonesome Dove and Larry McMurtry's further series Streets of Laredo, Dead Man's Walk and Comanche Moon. Then there were the History Channels popular Hatfields & McCoys and Texas Rising. Of course there have been countless westerns throughout the years, ranging from the black and white Roy Rogers and Errol Flynn movies to today's Dances With Wolves, Hostiles and The Magnificent Seven (remake of the original). Of course I would be remiss if I did not include John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. All of these are shot against beautiful landscapes and are full of thrilling adventure and stories of survival, during a time that was rough and gritty. What better place to film a western than right here in Oregon (home to the Oregon Trail)? Why not tell a gritty story of survival, hope, redemption and love? Well, that right there is what we are aimn' to do!

Making An Impact
Actors & ArtistsMany of us spend much of our time traveling to and from one project (theatrical/film) or another on a voluntary basis. We are actors and artists trying to make a living doing what we love, but many productions pay little to nothing. Our schedules and finances consist of jumping from one project to the next and sweating the whole time, because of the low pay and sacrifice. Here we have the chance to provide work for Oregon artists through 5 episodes. This will equate to several years of regular work for many Oregon filmmaker's and artist. But heck! We are not just looking to employ from our State only, we would love to expand, but this is just the jumping off point.

We are not telling a story just to tell a story.
Bringing History to LifeResearch. While not an actual historical recount of people and happenings, the story does delve into the history of the 1860's and the people and locations around it. Think of the Netflix's show Stranger Things, nothing historical about it other than the time period and settings.

Corfu is currently the only Greek island with a professionally manned and fully equiped mobile livestream and editing studio. The team at Studio Kerkyra can livestream independantly from anywhere and would love to be able to bring this technology to other islands in the future too, but for now this is what we will do with any funds raised:</p>
<p><strong>Tour Costs</strong><br/>Whilst we love the island and will do this tour regardless of finances it would be a great help, and allow us to do more livestreams in the future, with a little bit of backing from our fans and supporters.<br/>€500 - this will help very much and go towards the costs for one week of the tour.<br/>€1000 - this will contribute to the costs of two weeks of doing the tour.<br/>€2000 - yes, you know it, this will help tremendously for all 4 weeks of the tour.</p>
<p><strong>New &amp; Upgraded Equipment</strong><br/>€3000+ will contribute to buying additional and upgraded equipment, with cameras being the first on the list since ours still use tapes! Shock, horror! And... now you have an idea of how long Thomas Haas has actually been livestreaming for, they were the latest thing when he started!</p>
<p><strong>Solar Power Van Conversion</strong><br/>In the, erm... unlikely, event that we reach €10000+ we would like to convert our livestream van to solar power instead of using a generator to power our equipment when no local source is available. We do our best, with the tools we currently have, to keep our carbon footprint as low as possible and try to be eco friendly.</p>
<h3>How can I help?</h3>
<p>We came up with several ideas and decided on a select few.<br/>Better yet... not all of them cost money!<strong> </strong></p>

<h3>Social Inclusion &amp; Island Promotion</h3>
<p>The internet has played a huge part in keeping people connected during lockdowns and we know just how many people have lost out on their holiday abroad this year, especially those that were planning to come to Corfu. Our presence, live from Corfu, has been a Corfiot hug and some verbal sunshine for many during a difficult time. Reconnecting them to the island even if, and especially because, they can't be here which is reflected in our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/studiokerkyra/reviews/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reviews</a>.</p>
<p><strong>We all have one thing in common... our passion for Corfu! It's addictive and hard to leave behind. Hence the term Corfuholics which was coined by one of our regular viewers, thank you Anthonie </strong>(a signed T-shirt will be making its way to you).</p>
<p><i>""This show is what I look forward to after a day at work. I feel like I'm back on my favourite island and great to be able to take part. Great show, informative, funny and great presentation. How can any Corfuholic resist listening in!""</i><br/>Elaine Sgourou 13th July 2020</p>
<p><i>""The Studio Kerkyra deliver a light hearted, fun but very informative hour on the islands news and issues. Thomas, Claire and Adrian are very welcoming and it is a fun interactive show. You can ask any question and if they don't know, they will find out for you - but the other listeners might beat them to it. They welcome all comments and contributions - its like getting a great big Corfu hug everyday.""</i><br/>Sarah Roseamann 10th July 2020</p>
<p><i>""Great show with information and humour. Especially important at this time we all feel so disconnected. Nice to know there are other people all feeling the same with similar thoughts and questions.""</i><br/>Claire Harris 8th May 2020</p>
<p><i>""For anyone either living in Corfu or with a love of the island, I thoroughly recommend listening to Lockdown SK. The presenters are very open-minded, informative and their obvious affection and enthusiasm for their adopted home is very endearing. I particularly appreciate their attention to accuracy as they, and their producer, constantly check and re-check the verity of the information they relay to their audience. The listeners are encouraged to contribute so we feel totally included and part of the hour. They also speak via Skype with very interesting people from all over the world.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Covid-19 and local lockdowns are currently our biggest concern. We are committed to maintaining Social Distancing to protect our team as well as those we are lucky enough to meet on the tour. Lockdowns would cause disruption to our schedule, but not to worry though as we will pick up where we stopped once lockdowns are lifted even if we have to make some adjustments to locations and time schedules.</p>
<p>We are also reliant on internet connectivity and Social Platforms to provide a consistant service. Our current fans and followers are already aware that these things can cause occasional disruptions to livestreams but thay also know we will pick up where we left off as soon as all systems are stable again. Some will remember, not so long ago, that Facebook was having streaming issues one day so we jumped ship, mid stream, and took the commenting and conversation over to YouTube instead where the livestream was stable and uniterrupted.</p>
</div></div>","Update 4th August 2020Unfortunately we have had to pause the tour. We plan to pick it up again once it is feasible and safe to do so. We thank you very much for your patience and understanding.Who are we?
We are a team of seasoned professionals from the entertainment, tourism and IT sectors living on Corfu and using our skills to promote this beautiful island.

<p>We always strive to see the people are happy and friendly to each other, and the world we live is a big community where everybody is equal and have the same rights. </p>
<p>So, we came up with an idea to create 30 seconds short animated videos for people. These videos are short enough to watch for busy people and long enough to convey the message of happy life.</p>
<p>Our goal is to create 3 short videos in a week. Season 1 consisting of 100 series.</p>

<h3>Welcome! </h3>
<p>Thanks for stopping by, I hope you are as passionate as I am about enabling and elevating people. My name is Bill Branch and I have been a dedicated teacher/instructor since 2001. </p>
<p>In the past year I have dedicated myself to creating free training for anyone seeking to pass the FAA's Remote Pilot Exam for a drone or unmanned aircraft. I have just recently made those available on YouTube. I have also create the industry's best professional grade 174 page visually intense <a href=""http://bit.ly/Study_Guide_IndieGoGo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">study guide for free right here</a>.</p>
<p><i><strong>Now is the time: the <u>right thing to do</u> is to make this all accessible and useful for the D/deaf &amp; HoH communities.</strong></i></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.coconino.edu/resources/files/pdfs/public-relations/coconotions/7CocoNotions_October_2016.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i><strong>Here is a link of my experience helping people elevate their lives.</strong></i></a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My current research indicates that it will require $22,000 to have all 82 training videos with an ASL translator &amp; captions. </p>
<p>You are contributing to more than a campaign, you are helping build something larger...something magnificent, something magical. It is my hope that this campaign inspires other training programs to provide more ASL enabled services.</p>
<p><strong>1st:</strong> <i>What you get is about what you gave. That is our path too.</i></p>
<p><strong>2nd: </strong>Contributors will get perks such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A) access to our premium training services to use or gift to a friend.</li>
<li>B) a unique token of appreciation such as a high quality long sleeve shirt indicating that you contributed to a higher purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, if we do not reach our goal we will continue to use the funds to create as many videos and training resources for the D/deaf &amp; HoH communities as possible. If at this point then we hope that we find ASL volunteers to help finish the project.</p>
<p>If the funding goal is exceeded then the remaining funding will be used, to the extend possible, to help fund D/deaf &amp; HoH students for our premium services. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The highest service is the service to others without asking for anything back but a smile, to elevate others and cherish that moment forever. So...Smile it looks good on you. </p>
<p>I have created 82 freely available training videos on YouTube &amp; a 174 page document for free. My dedication to helping others is real, it is important to me and it is priceless.  </p>
<p>This is my passion! I hope it is your passion too...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I value people who are passionate about enabling and elevating others. If you can volunteer in any way please let me know :-)</p>
</div></div>","Welcome! 
Thanks for stopping by, I hope you are as passionate as I am about enabling and elevating people. My name is Bill Branch and I have been a dedicated teacher/instructor since 2001. 
In the past year I have dedicated myself to creating free training for anyone seeking to pass the FAA's Remote Pilot Exam for a drone or unmanned aircraft. I have just recently made those available on YouTube. I have also create the industry's best professional grade 174 page visually intense study guide for free right here.
Now is the time: the right thing to do is to make this all accessible and useful for the D/deaf & HoH communities.
Here is a link of my experience helping people elevate their lives.

What We Need & What You Get
My current research indicates that it will require $22,000 to have all 82 training videos with an ASL translator & captions. 
You are contributing to more than a campaign, you are helping build something larger...something magnificent, something magical. It is my hope that this campaign inspires other training programs to provide more ASL enabled services.
1st: What you get is about what you gave. That is our path too.
2nd: Contributors will get perks such as:

A) access to our premium training services to use or gift to a friend.
B) a unique token of appreciation such as a high quality long sleeve shirt indicating that you contributed to a higher purpose.

OK, if we do not reach our goal we will continue to use the funds to create as many videos and training resources for the D/deaf & HoH communities as possible. If at this point then we hope that we find ASL volunteers to help finish the project.
If the funding goal is exceeded then the remaining funding will be used, to the extend possible, to help fund D/deaf & HoH students for our premium services. 

The Impact
The highest service is the service to others without asking for anything back but a smile, to elevate others and cherish that moment forever. So...Smile it looks good on you. 
I have created 82 freely available training videos on YouTube & a 174 page document for free. My dedication to helping others is real, it is important to me and it is priceless.  
This is my passion! I hope it is your passion too...

Risks & Challenges
I value the input of the D/deaf & HoH community and as such I will listen but I also know that there might be a few conflicting or contrasting opinions. I will do my best to consider all ideas and opinions with the highest level of respect possible. 
Again, this project might not achieve full funding...I have never given up on my service to others and as such I will, one way or another, make sure this project comes to full fruition. I am always seeking volunteers so...If you are a reputable ASL translator willing to help then please please contact me today.

<p><i>The Battle For Space</i> will be a compelling and wildly entertaining sci-fi adventure series that the whole family can enjoy!  Our story begins in Season 1, and is told over the course of four 30 minute episodes that follow a ragtag crew of space outlaws who must battle their way across corporate controlled space to find the mysterious science stones that will bring peace back to the universe, and overthrow the evil Amadan Empire. </p>
<p>But let’s be clear, <strong>WE'RE NOT MAKING <i>STAR WARS</i></strong>, and we don’t want to. What we will be making is a fun, modern, and action filled B-Movie space adventure with some Outer Banks flair.  But we need help to make it happen.</p>

<p>But we’re not just asking for your money.  We are also reaching out to our local Outer Banks community for help in other ways.  We need extras! People who can show up and wear a Space Trooper outfit or an alien costume and look bad a$$.  We need a warehouse! One big enough (2 - 3 car garage or larger) that we can build spaceship interiors in and film scenes in over the winter.  Plus much more! Do you want to be a part of the production or know of a cool location that could serve as an alien planet or futuristic interior?  Reach out and let us know!</p>
<p>Lastly, we want <i>The Battle For Space</i> to promote our area’s unique landscapes, skilled artisans, acting talent, and local businesses that are here, ready and waiting to support larger scale Hollywood productions… You know, the kinds that could bring in millions of dollars during the off season months.</p>

<p><strong>Rewards and Shipping </strong>- The awesome perks that you receive based on your level of giving cost money, and to ensure that we meet yours and our expectations we feel it’s important to give you the best that we can, for supporting us with all that you can.</p>
<p><strong>Production Costs </strong>- We’re talking costumes, sets, models, camera equipment, props, location and permit fees, catering, robots, aliens, etc.  The things that are going to make our film happen.  The estimated $17,500 left over from the $25k raised will go straight into the production costs.</p>
<p>As you may notice, the production costs cover a wide gamut.  But something that they don’t cover are the salaries of cast and crew.  What makes this project so awesome is that it’s a passion project for all involved. All of the cast and crew will be giving their free time to make this happen.  So every dollar we have, will be seen on screen.</p>

Ben is a recent graduate currently working as a software tester, Ben a club promoter and Yong, the joke of the group is a stock broker. The story alternates around their lives and how they manage to survive as  young men in a fragile environment. The animations covers every detail of their day from the moment they wake up in the morning to when the night stand is turned off in their rooms. Sit back and I hope you enjoy the animations when we start the uploads in early August.This is the first production from the our production company, ASTERI PICTURES. The dream is to bring an animation that you can relate with to life. The storyline in the animation incorporates real life events and other events we do on a daily basics. Interested in a preview of the first few chapters, go on the website/ projects /scripts. Click the link http://www.asteripictures.co.uk​.Our budget as stated is £3,000. Included is a detailed copy of our outline, so you'll know exactly where each money donated is going. But to summarize, the main expenses is represented with the pie chart below:With each contribution, we've offered a certain PERK. From the very low investment, to the highest of highs, you'll get a gift in exchange for helping us achieve our goal. They're detailed below, but range from a social media shout out, all the way to a full-fledged credit at the end of the film.Like all investments, the biggest question is - what if you don't reach your goal? Although we expect nothing but going well above it, if we don't happen to hit our amount, we'll use the money we do raise in order to still tell the story. We'll cut back and delegate different amount of money to different areas, but we'll issue full transparency on where each and every money of yours is going.If you have been with us thus far, THANK YOU!
