<p>Assalamu Alaikum,<br/><br/>From influencing musical genres such as blues, jazz, and rap to participation in the Black Arts Movement and beyond, Black Muslims in the United States have a rich artistic and literary tradition. <br/><br/><a href=""https://medium.com/the-drinking-gourd"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Drinking Gourd</a> aims to continue on that path as a Black Muslim literary magazine. We will provide nuanced depictions of the Black Muslim Diaspora through various forms of media, including but not limited to: visual art, poems, non-fiction, and fiction. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>ABOUT </h3>
<p>Centered within the legacies of Black Muslim liberation theology and Afrofuturism, The Drinking Gourd will serve as space where Black Muslims can articulate our experiences, passions, and selves outside of appeals to authority or dogma — whether those are in relation to the larger Muslim community or the various colonial empires that make up the West.<br/><br/>The publication’s name comes from a Black American folksong referencing the Big Dipper and its use in locating the Northstar. We named ourselves in this way to bring in the memories of enslaved African Muslims and their pursuit of freedom throughout the Americas.<br/><br/>While our editorial calendar partially depends on the number of submissions we receive, The Drinking Gourd intends to publish new content at least 2-4 times a month. We plan to release themed series alongside our regular content. <br/><br/>We must add that The Drinking Gourd exists for the entire Black Muslim ummah. With many of The Drinking Gourd’s creators being queer Muslims ourselves, we unequivocally acknowledge and validate the existence of other Black LGBT+ Muslims. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>FUNDING</h3>
<p>For this project, we are fundraising $6,000. The Drinking Gourd's editorial team is entirely composed of volunteers and hosted on Medium to eliminate any costs associated with a website. All funding is intended for paying contributors. <br/><br/>At The Drinking Gourd, we do not believe in starting a magazine and asking for contributors without offering any compensation. It is narrated from 'Abdullah bin 'Umar that the Prophet (PBUH) said: ""Give the worker his wages before his sweat dries.""<br/><br/>Our magazine will offer all of our contributors a $50 flat rate to start. We hope that The Drinking Gourd can grow and receive enough community support to increase this rate.<br/><br/>This fundraiser will permit our magazine to publish through at least October 2020. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Speaking of the Environment: What Your Science Classes Didn't Teach You About Effective Communication</i> is a guidebook to help you connect your science and environmental goals with winning communication strategies. From understanding your audiences, identifying your key messages, visualizing data, and more, this book will help you become a better communicator to win over more hearts and minds. <br/><br/>My name is Paula Jasinski and I am the coauthor of <i>Speaking of the Environment: What Your Science Classes Didn't Teach You About Effective Communication</i>. David Jasinski and I wrote this book because most environmental and scientific organizations lack the tools to effectively communicate with the audiences they need to engage with. In this book, we translate our years of experience in environmental communication into steps you can follow to identify your key audiences and effectively engage with them.<br/><br/>Our hope is that, in reading this book, you will be able to apply what we’ve learned in almost three decades of communicating about the environment. Ultimately, we want you to see this book as a tool to help you transition from spewing facts to telling stories, both verbally and visually.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about Listening to Learn, Connecting Messages to Audiences, Avoiding Jargon, The Power of Story, and Techniques for Visualizing Information. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>End points are often not selling points. What you think of as the end points for environmental work (e.g., water quality or species restoration) may not be selling points for those you need to influence. Learn how to identify the co-benefits and themes that will resonate with your audiences and help you reach your goals.</li>
<li>How listening to audiences can make you smarter and more effective. Listening is a super-power when you use it to understand what influences decisions and behavior changes.</li>
<li>How to apply lessons from the world of marketing and apply them to environmental restoration and protection. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>You want to supercharge your environmental outreach;</li>
<li>You’d like to develop communication products that align with your audiences to meet your goals;</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>“Toni Brooks only has one rule when it comes to relationships: do not get attached. The only thing worse than falling in love is losing yourself in the process. When choosing between fight or flight, Toni picks flight. Although she’s given up on love, professionally, she is a top contender for the Emerging Voice award from the Black Media Association. Life is good until she's forced to connect with the family she hasn’t spoken to in a decade and the man she should’ve fought for.</p>
<p>Forced home for the foreseeable future, Toni has to decide if she wants to repair her relationships before she loses the people she’d left behind for good.”</p>
<p>Hi, my name is Amber Tucker, and I write black romance novels under the pen name Shaii Wright. I’m self-publishing my debut novel, <i>The Ones I Left Behind,</i>  standalone novel that comes out this Fall. I started this book based on a radio prompt: What’s the worst thing you’ve ever done to someone? I can’t tell you the answer because it’s a spoiler :) BUT what started as a radio prompt and a short story in undergrad turned into an 85,000 word novel that I completed during a double masters program (MS in Publishing and MFA in Creative Writing) while working full-time and raising two kids with my husband.</p>
<p>This book is more than just a passion project. It is the catalyst for the new life I’m building for my family as an entrepreneur and an author. The Ones I Left Behind will be the first book published under my new publishing company, Just Write Publishing!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I’ve wanted to open a publishing company and self-publish my own books since I was in middle school. I was the kid that spent most of her time at the library or blew her birthday money on books at Borders (RIP). The Ones I Left Behind is the fruition of a childhood dream. Adding my voice to the collection of black women authors is a privilege that I hold dear. </p>
<p><i>The Ones I Left Behind</i> is a story about forgiveness, finding your identity, and choosing love over fear. The main character, Toni, is flawed and makes bad choices, but she's also determined, ambitious and willing to grow.</p>
<p><strong>Early review:</strong></p>
<p>Reading <i>The One's I Left Behind</i> was like reading a guilty-pleasure romance novel, without the guilt. Each character has a complex history that has shaped the way they love their partners and live their adult lives. Shaii perfectly paints a picture of a modern woman, Toni, attempting to rewrite her destiny. Her relationship with her family taught her one thing - to leave. Toni is confident, strong, and intelligent. I was hooked from the start; I was rooting for Toni one second and shaking my head in disgrace the next. Complex characters, with drama and humor. A perfect mix for a fun read that will leave you breathless. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Self-publishing is a risk. I don’t have a traditional publishing machine backing me. I am the writer, marketer, PR, creative director--it all starts and stops with me. I choose this, without regrets. BUT it’s still a lot of pressure. And there is the definite risk that for all of the hours I put into this book, it won’t sell. </p>
<p>I didn’t sleep for five years! I laugh about it now, but while I completed the double masters program, I drank a lot of coffee and Red Bull. Most nights, I stayed up until three in the morning and had to wake up a few hours later to get the kids up and ready for school. I nursed my son while I wrote the book, or a paper. This was hard! But finishing it was the first challenge and I did it. I can say that I am beyond proud of my work and I’m ready to write book two.</p>
<p>I choose self-publishing, knowing the challenges because it was important that my first book be on my own terms. From the look and feel, to the release date--I didn’t want to be at the mercy of traditional publishing's timing and intent. I wanted to do it for myself so that I could help aspiring authors and storytellers do it too. </p>
<p>While I may not have a big name to back me, I have a big support system. They have allowed me to pursue this dream with relentless energy. It is my hope that you’ll join my team. I’m ready to keep the momentum going and write books two and three.</p>
<p> </p>

Hi, my name is Amber Tucker, and I write black romance novels under the pen name Shaii Wright. I’m self-publishing my debut novel, The Ones I Left Behind,  standalone novel that comes out this Fall. I started this book based on a radio prompt: What’s the worst thing you’ve ever done to someone?

The Impact
I’ve wanted to open a publishing company and self-publish my own books since I was in middle school. I was the kid that spent most of her time at the library or blew her birthday money on books at Borders (RIP). The Ones I Left Behind is the fruition of a childhood dream. Adding my voice to the collection of black women authors is a privilege that I hold dear. 
The Ones I Left Behind is a story about forgiveness, finding your identity, and choosing love over fear. The main character, Toni, is flawed and makes bad choices, but she's also determined, ambitious and willing to grow.
Early review:
Reading The One's I Left Behind was like reading a guilty-pleasure romance novel, without the guilt. Each character has a complex history that has shaped the way they love their partners and live their adult lives. Shaii perfectly paints a picture of a modern woman, Toni, attempting to rewrite her destiny. Her relationship with her family taught her one thing - to leave. Toni is confident, strong, and intelligent. I was hooked from the start; I was rooting for Toni one second and shaking my head in disgrace the next. Complex characters, with drama and humor. A perfect mix for a fun read that will leave you breathless.

Risks & Challenges
Self-publishing is a risk. I don’t have a traditional publishing machine backing me. I am the writer, marketer, PR, creative director--it all starts and stops with me. I choose this, without regrets. BUT it’s still a lot of pressure. And there is the definite risk that for all of the hours I put into this book, it won’t sell. 
I didn’t sleep for five years! I laugh about it now, but while I completed the double masters program, I drank a lot of coffee and Red Bull. Most nights, I stayed up until three in the morning and had to wake up a few hours later to get the kids up and ready for school. I nursed my son while I wrote the book, or a paper. This was hard! But finishing it was the first challenge and I did it. I can say that I am beyond proud of my work and I’m ready to write book two.
I choose self-publishing, knowing the challenges because it was important that my first book be on my own terms. From the look and feel, to the release date--I didn’t want to be at the mercy of traditional publishing's timing and intent. I wanted to do it for myself so that I could help aspiring authors and storytellers do it too. 
While I may not have a big name to back me, I have a big support system. They have allowed me to pursue this dream with relentless energy. It is my hope that you’ll join my team. I’m ready to keep the momentum going and write books two and three.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Greetings Everyone!</p>
<p>My name is Alfredo, and first allow me to thank you in advance for taking time in wanting to help me out. I sincerely felt compelled to launch this campaign to help my mother-in-law who is an Elementary School teacher and a first-time grandmother.</p>
<p>My mother-in-law is one who will never ask for anything, yet she will give you the world if she could. Many of us are aware that our teachers work hard but receive little pay.</p>
<p>I personally have seen my mother-in-law work awfully long hours, sometimes until midnight or longer. Most of her weekends she spends grading papers, filling out reports, working on lesson plans, etc., all the things teachers do to help our kids. At times, I have seen her sadness when she can’t join the family during those special occasions because of school deadlines and obligations.</p>
<p> She seriously works very hard and is dedicated to meet the needs of all her students.</p>
<p>What I admire the most is how she always goes above and beyond to help students that are economically disadvantage. Numerous times, I have seen my mother-in-law spend her last $20 just to buy shoes, socks, jackets, or school supplies for students that are in more dire need. Year after year, she sacrifices so much for others and gives unselfishly of herself.</p>
<p>As a grandmother, there isn’t anything she wouldn’t do for my son, including writing a book for him.</p>
<p>So, when my mother-in-law mentioned how she wished she could publish “Jedi’s book,” and share it with others, and knowing how she always does so much for anyone in need, I knew I had to help.</p>
<p>For these reasons and more, I sincerely ask for your support. Please join my wife, son, and I in launching this campaign to promote and publish her book. I also ask that you please find it in your heart and help this well deserving teacher/grandmother and be a part of making her dream come true.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p><br/>Fortunately, my wife and I were able to print a couple of proof copies of the book<br/>Heartstrings. One book was for my mother-in-law and the other to promote this<br/>campaign. We certainly want the quality of the books to look great for everyone. That is<br/>why I am asking from the bottom of my heart to support this campaign, so that we can<br/>publish more books. Rest assured that your generous donations will allow us to help<br/>my mother-in-law. In addition, it will also help us “Pay it Forward” by donating to our<br/>School Libraries, Children’s Hospitals, and the Children’s Advocacy Centers, all the<br/>places my mother-in-law holds dear to her heart.<br/>Our perks are incredibly unique, and there are several options you can choose. You<br/>can simply select to receive the Heartstrings book, or select receiving a matching gift<br/>card with the book, or choose the Heartstring book (signed by the author) and it will also<br/>include a custom-made heartstring book marker made by the author herself (she loves<br/>crafts). As you can see, each option is exclusive and unique.<br/>I was able to print some proof copies to show for the campaign. We want to make sure<br/>the quality is great for everyone who is able to support the campaign.  We need your<br/>support so we can not only get Heartstrings in your hands but also donate Heartstrings<br/>to school libraries to as many as we can reach. <br/>Our perks are very unique, you have many options to get not only a book but to also get<br/>a gift card thanking a special person who pulled your heartstring. Another very special<br/>perk which gets you a custom heartstring book marker made by the author herself (she<br/>loves crafts).  Each one is unique and each will be different from another. <br/>If we are able to get funding we will work to get them in bookstores and libraries around<br/>the world in hopes we can pull someones heartstring. My mother in-law loves helping<br/>kids less fortunate so we will try to help as many kids this holiday season with your<br/>donations. </p>
<h3>

I ask that<br/>you become part of this schoolteacher’s dream, and also become part of my family’s<br/>vision to pay it forward not only to my mother-in-law, but others around the world.</p>

Your<br/>support will also help donate to someone around and helping us pull their heartstring. <br/>Risks &amp;amp; Challenges<br/>Shipping is the only risk.

<h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Have you ever wondered why saving money or growing personal income into a personal financial success story is so difficult for the vast majority of people in the world today?  There may be various reasons that may explain the failure but studies done on this subject highlight “ignorance” as the primary cause of problem.  Just ask yourself whether you have any formal education on savings or growing your personal income.  If your answer is “yes” then you are one of the few exceptions, but if your answer is “no” then your perception/practice of how you go about your savings and growing your income is not based on a professional knowledge obtained in school but on common sense and assumption, raising questions about the accuracy and effectiveness of the knowledge itself.  Similarly, if you ask ten people to define Personal Financial Security the chances are that you will get ten different definitions or even none at all.   That just indicates how much this important subject is scarcely understood!  Is it any wonder then that the vast majority of the people in the world today end up trapped in personal financial ruin, personal-income stagnation, or even poverty? </p>
<p>My work in orphan-care not only includes helping to provide holistic support to needy orphaned children but also to help to foster micro-enterprises and orphan-related poverty alleviation initiatives.  It was the experiences in these activities, over the years, that sparked the observation that the common perception people have on savings/growing personal income and the methodologies they apply are not based on a professional financial knowledge obtained in school but on common sense and assumption, thus, resulting in the massive personal financial failures and (partly) the poverty we see in the world today.  This observation, and other factors, prompted me to undertake a study on the subject and the results, inadvertently, led to the writing of the book I now want to publish. </p>

<h3>Will This Book Really Succeed?</h3>
<p>Surveys conducted on this subject indicate that the term ""Personal Financial Security,"" which the book is largely all about, just doesn’t attract most people’s curiosity nor sufficiently draw their attention, and yet the subject represents the very financial progressiveness in life which the vast majority of people crave for.  This is the major weakness a book on this topic carries with it, but this is like the question of the honey and the honeycombs.  The honeycombs don’t appeal much to anyone’s appetite yet inside it lies the sweetest of all syrups.  So my strategy is to “get the honeycombs out of the way, and get people to taste the honey.”  Besides, the book addresses and seeks to meet a human need; a common need which almost every person strives for -- a formidable personal financial security.  On that score, yes, the book will be a success – it will be self-advertising once “tasted” by the market.  </p>

He was jumping around the bed trying to get the man to come back to life and enjoy every second of it. He pulled the curtain open to let the sunshine flood the room and right on the man's face.</p><p>""Daddy! Come on! It's morning! Look how beautiful it is! Let's play!""</p><p>The man barely opened his eyes. The light was blinding him. In spite of the perpetual tired feeling he had, he managed to pull the covers up</p><p>""Hop in""</p><p>The boy jumped in and under cuddling to his father. The man hugged him and left the covers to land over their heads.  They were still. He felt that now they can go back to sleep. But the feeling vanished in a split of a second when the little one just jolt and started to move around looking for a playful time. Knowing that he will not be able to snooze, the man went in play mode and start tickling the boy. He filled the room with sharp and loud laughter. Right in the same moment they heard from the other room the cry of a baby.</p><p>""Oh. You woke him up...""</p><p>""Sorry daddy. You tickled me""</p><p>""Yes, you're right. It's my fault. I should've thought that mom is sleeping in the other room with the little one. Can you believe you have a brother? How should we name him? I know we'll have to ask mom, but how would you like to call you brother?""</p><p>""Hmmm... Daniel?""</p><p>""That sound good, my little thinker.""</p><p>""Who named me? Otty...?""</p><p>""Mom did. Your name is Attila, but we like to call you Otty because is cute and it fits you just now.""</p><p>""Ohh...""</p><p>""Hey boys... thank you for the wakeup call. I could've used another hour of sleep. This little one woke me up almost every hour last night.""</p><p>""Mommy!!!"" the boy ran to her and hugged her thighs.</p><p>The woman was holding the newborn in her arms, but she lowered her hand to grab Otty and caress his hair.</p><p>""Good morning, sweetie. Did you have a good night? Good dreams?""</p><p>""Yes mommy, I dreamed that me and him went up and flew over the clouds and we were able to see the entire world from there.""</p><p>""Wow, my little pilot. How about daddy flies you to the kitchen and makes a coffee. I will go fuel this little airplane."" and she switched the little one from a hold to a floating position and started to move towards the bedroom while humming an engine sound. The little one giggled.</p><p>Dad went on her lead and picked up Otty, lay him flat on his hands and flu him into the kitchen. They still don't know who came up with the flying game, but it looks like it was the family tradition. When they got to the kitchen, dad started to alternate the engine buzz with an alarm sound.</p><p>""Mayday, mayday. We're losing power. Prepare for emergency landing. Landing gear down. Lower the landing gear"". The boy bent his legs.</p><p>""Hit the brakes and cut the engine. That looks like a good spot to land with minimum casualties. Prepare for impact!"" and he sat him on the counter. They both laugh because of the while imagination that was making their time together so much fun.</p><p>""Now I need to save some lives""</p><p>""Oh. Is anyone in danger?""</p><p>""Yes, us. Mommy needs coffee. If we're not providing the essential fuel, we might lose our lives at the wrath of the morning monster.""</p><p>The boy smiled and opened a cabinet pulling the sugar out. He knew the drill and he knew that as much as they were playing and joking... it was a seed of truth in that.</p><p>The man grabbed the pot, poor the water, turned on the gas and put it on the stove like a well-practiced lifesaving maneuver. It was in the making and their lives were about to be spared. Another successful mission.</p><p>""Honey! The coffee is ready. Do you want me to bring it to you or you want it in the kitchen?""</p><p> </p><p>""Just leave it there, honey. I am still taking care of this little one. It's been four days since we brought him home and he didn't let me be a second. He's hungry all the time."" she said from the bedroom and turned to the little sucker with a sweet tone ""who gonna be a big strong boy? who's gonna take mommy on dates and bring home a nice girl to be his wife? who's gonna give mommy some nice grandchildren? Who? You tell me you little cutie.""</p><p>The man conformed and left the coffee on the counter. She took a whiff and felt the aroma all the way from the bedroom. It was such a good feel flowing in the home. The morning was perfect. She was feeding the little one in the bedroom, her husband that she loves so much was playing with their first born in the living room, it was a nice sunny day, the spring was on its way finally after the long gloomy winter, the air was fresh, the little one was home, everything was just great. All this made her close her eyes and let a big smile flourish with joy. The sun was warming up her face. It was such a good feeling.</p><p>""Mommy.."" Otty appeared in the door frame.</p><p>""Yes sweetie"" the woman barely mumbled trying to come back from her dreamy stance.</p><p>""Daniel""</p><p>""Who?""</p><p>""Daniel. This is how we should call him"" the boy said entering the room and coming closer to the bed to see his brother's face.</p><p>""Oh. You mean to name him Daniel? That's a nice name. Hmmm... Sounds like a good idea. We'll need to ask daddy to see if he wants too.""</p><p>""Daddy said yes!"" the boy replied enthusiastic while the man showed up in the frame. She looked at him with wondering eyes and he nodded.</p><p>""Then Daniel it is! Welcome home Daniel!"" she said with no fear that the baby will wake up. She knew he's sound asleep. He usually does after a good meal.</p><p>""Otty, go in the living room and find some nice cartoons on TV. I have to do something and I'll come to sit with you. Honey, I'll let you have a nap if you need one. We'll be quiet for a while.""</p><p>""Thank you sweetie. You're the best husband ever. No wonder I chased you down like a lamb at Easter time. Ok. I think this time I will just snuggle with... Daniel. You know what? I like it. It sounds good. Otty's a smart kid and he has a big heart. I love that boy. What a blessing. Ok. I will just lay back here with him.""</p><p>""No problem. That's why I am here and that's why... I let you chase me. I wanted you to catch me.""</p><p>""You're funny... “the woman said with a whisper that almost dissipated in the air before it reached him.</p><p>He got closer, caressed her and kissed her forehead.</p><p>""Sweet dreams. I'll go take care of some business. Make you a little surprise. You know... for my girl."" He straighten up, took a moment to take in the beautiful picture of mother and baby, tilted his head with an emotional smile and slowly backed out of the room.</p><p>""Ok Otty. Watch these cartoons until I come back.""</p><p>""Where are you going daddy? You're going to work?""</p><p>""No. It's Saturday. It's week-end. Why do you think we had time to play the morning? You know usually you don't see me in the morning because I am at work long before you're even waking up. No. I just need to prepare a little surprise for mommy when she wakes up. You know, it's nice to do nice things for the ones you love...""</p><p>""And you love mommy! Yey!""</p><p>The man made the boy a sign to tone it down so the other half of the family can get some well-deserved rest.</p><p>""I will not be long. Watch the cartoons.""</p><p>He shuffled the boy’s hair and left the room smiling. Yes, it felt so good to be with his family, with his lovely wife that he's adoring from the first moment he saw her, with his son that is growing up and, at just two years old, he's so loving and smart and cares so much of the world and his family, with his newborn that just came home a couple of days ago and made his family a whole. His smile was an involuntary one, a smile that was stubborn to stay on his face  for a long time. That's the smile that he was wishing that everyone would experience and keep it for as long as they live.</p><p>Ho opened the door to the garage and head to the car, popped the trunk and pulled out a plastic garbage bag. It didn't look too heavy but it was pretty bulky. He brought the bag in and head to the laundry room, opened the washing machine and poured the contents in it, switched the dial of the machine, poured some detergent and CLOROX and got it going. The feel good smile slightly morphed in a satisfaction one knowing that she will be pleased with what he just did.</p><p>""Hey Otty, I'll make some breakfast. What do you want to eat?"" he asked once he got in the living room. He knew already he made a mistake asking a toddler what he wants to eat for breakfast. He almost lip synced what the boy said: “peanut butter and jelly sandwich with milk"".</p><p>""Can we eat here, daddy?"" the boy added quickly to be sure his daddy heard him and that he will agree on bringing the breakfast in front of the TV.</p><p>""You know what? It's Saturday. For sure! We need to feel like week-end""</p><p>""Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeey!"" the boy whispered pretending to be loud from his body language.</p><p>The man's smile morphed again, but this time in an amused one. He always wondered where he is coming up with all these behaviors and ideas. He was proud of his son. He always wanted boys and God gave him two now. Yes, he had double trouble...</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>""Ok. Here it is. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for the royal pilots. After such a rough landing I think we are entitled to treat ourselves from the royal kitchen with the best chef's specialty.""</p><p>""You forgot the milk daddy"" the boy said laughing at his dad's silliness.</p><p>""Oh, my dear commander, you're right. I will go fetch it right now. But before I go, may I ask how you would like your milk? In a cup or in a bottle?""</p><p>""Daddy, you're funny"" the boy said and slipped into the character ""Please bring me a cup, Sir! I am not a baby anymore. I am a royal commander air-force pilot and I deserved to be treated like a man!""</p><p>The boy's reply made the man burst in a suppressed laughter. He was trying to keep quiet, but the boy was way too funny. He loves him so much. He wished his father would've been that goofy with him when he was a kid, but it didn't happen. Now he seized the opportunity and he made the best of it and it paid off. These moments are priceless.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p> </p><p>She opened her eyes slowly like being afraid that the air moved by her eyelashes will wake the little one. Such a cozy feeling. The coffee smell was still lingering around the home and she wanted one so badly. Daniel was still sleeping. Quiet. Peaceful. Just seeing his face brought her a smile. She couldn't believe that her life turned around so good and in such a good direction. Here she was lying down with her precious newborn, in the living room was the man that rescued her, her knight with shiny helmet because he didn't have an armor at the time, with her first born which, in her eyes, was a genius. What more could she ask from life? Oh. Coffee. Right.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p>""Hey, I'll go check on the laundry. I'll be right back""</p><p>""Ok daddy."" the boy barely mumbled chewing on the peanut butter sandwich.</p><p>While Otty was absorbed by the funny cartoons that they were watching, Attila went in the laundry to check on the load. Opened the washing machine. Everything was looking good and white. He put a little more Clorox to make sure they will be bright when she sees them.</p><p> </p><p>*</p><p>His face was so peaceful. His eyes were closed but his eyelashes were so fragile, so delicate, his nose was so tiny and squishy, his lips were like sculpted by an artist. Here she was, falling in love again. For the third time. This time with Daniel, the little baby that was starting his life in such a loving family. She couldn't stop staring at him, at every details of his face, at every little hair on his tiny head, at the almost see trough tiny ears, at the little chicks that were budging every time when he would cry or smile. She's lucky. He did smile sometimes to her and not because he was gassy.</p><p>The peace in the room was so comforting. It’s the first time she felt like that since the birth. She really needed a break like this so she can regain herself and her mind, herself.</p><p>She would like to wake him up so she can get her well-deserved coffee, but she didn’t want to spoil the moment. It was too precious to be selfish. Now she was sharing this with him just how she will share her whole life with him. She is his mother until her last breath.</p><p>He was lying there so still and so peaceful, so quiet and so calm.</p><p>She couldn’t help herself and she needed to caress him. Her finger gently touched his hair and sled down on his temple, down on his ear and on his chick. He was sleeping. She was hoping to not wake him up. Because he didn’t react to her touch, she felt accomplished. She was able to love him without disturbing him. And again she got lost in staring at his little being lying there resting: his eyes, his nose, his mouth… so cute and fragile, his little body cuddled up under the thing blanket. Not a sound, not a move. Not a move?</p><p>She pulled her head back to be able to have a full view of him, touched his forehead, sled her fingers on his chick. Nothing. She didn’t want to freak out. It might just be an illusion. She softly pinched his ear… Nothing. She let a desperate scream out of her lungs which, like a thunder, filled and shook the house in a split second.</p><p>“What?” the husband appeared in the door with big eyes and his heart pumping.</p><p>“The baby!” the woman barely made sense of her mumbling</p><p>“What?!” he came closer while she got the little one in her arms. He wasn’t responsive.</p><p>“I think he’s dead” she cried and looking around with desperation tried to find ways to cater to the newborn.</p><p>“No. It can’t be.”</p><p>The man approached to look closer and see how he can help. Both of them were panicked. Otty showed up and joined the emotional whirlpool not understanding exactly what’s happening, but being influenced by the cry that flood the house.</p><p>Her tears we’re blurring her vision. She was lost. She took Daniel and snuggled him in close to her heart to keep him comfortable. Maybe he can hear her heart beating and that will get him to know that mommy is there for him. Attila picked up the phone and called the Emergency. Otty was crying holding to his leg. While he was waiting for an answer, the man picked him up and held him in his arms. The toddler was crying on his shoulder and hugging him strong with his little arms. The operator picked up.</p><p> </p><p>""911, what is your emergency?""</p><p>""Quick! My newborn is not moving. We need an ambulance fast!""</p><p>""Sir, did you check for pulse?""</p><p>""I don't know how. It's a newborn. He's small. Where do I do that?""</p><p>""Sir, did you listen for a heartbeat?""</p><p>""No..."" turning to her ""can you please listen for a beat?""</p><p>She was holding the little one as cozy as a mother can hold her precious baby and she was afraid to disturb him. She went to the bed, lay him there and put her ear close to his chest. She was hoping. Even that the tiny chest wasn't really moving, she was hoping to hear something. Nothing. Her cry intensified and looked around not knowing what to do. Even that she was a strong women, this was a blow that she couldn't take. Right now she wished she was six feet underground or never born. The pain was tearing every cell of her body and it came out in a yell that wished to crush the injustice.</p><p>He was standing there with the phone to the ear and his son in his arms. He was speechless. The hope left him and now he was realizing that the one that they just brought from the hospital a couple of days ago, was gone, that their new addition to the family wasn't anymore, that the little sparkle of joy that brought her laughter and hope, died.</p><p>""Sir?... Sir? Are you still there?""</p><p>The man grabbed his son stronger in his arms trying to calm him down. Even that he didn't really knew what's happening, Otty was feeling the atmosphere in the room, he was picking up from his mother and he was bulging.</p><p>""Sir?!? I need you to talk to me.""</p><p>""Yes..."" he answered in between the desperate voices that were letting out the anger, the anxiety, the sorrow and the forsaken feelings all combined in a mash of rage.</p><p>""I am here... Please send an ambulance. I think it's too late...""</p><p>He put down the phone and, trying to keep strong in front of his family, held his tears and went to his wife to comfort her. When he got closer and watched the little one lying on the bed, knowing the he's gone, he just burst in a man cry. He loved his family and as much as he tried to be strong for them in those moment he couldn't hold back his feelings. Fell on his knees beside his wife, put his arm around her and leaned over the little baby. They were all crying. The air was filled with hurt.</p><p>A strong and rushed knock on the door threw him out of the morning stance. The loud bangs were covering the cries. He left Otty by his mom and went to open.</p><p>""Hello Sir. We received an emergency call from you. Where is the baby?""</p><p>""This way"" he rushed to show them to the bedroom.</p><p>""Ma'am, please step back. We need to assess the baby"".</p><p>The paramedic started the procedure while the family was watching helplessly.</p><p>""Can I please ask to go in the living room? I need some space and get to some procedures that don't look too good from outside. Thank you""</p><p>They got out of the room and head to the living room. Their faces were red and hot. The mixture of feelings was so confusing that they felt drained.</p><p>The man kept working around the baby trying to find ways to find out if he's really gone or he can do something to bring him back, to wake him up. He didn't get a pulse or a heartbeat, a breath, or any vital sign so he moved to CPR.</p><p>""Come on, you little one, help me out here. I can't do it myself. I need your will to live. You have a full life in front of you. You need to live it. Don't just go out"" the man was thinking while he was continuing the procedure.</p><p>The family was trying to calm down in the living room. The other paramedic was trying to help with some cold compresses for their foreheads and with some water to, at least, take their toughs away from the worst case scenario.</p><p>Finally the officer came out of the bedroom.</p><p>""I am really sorry... He's gone""</p><p>Elena burst again in a wild cry and fell on the floor crawling in the fetus position. Her husband grabbed the toddler and sled down by her trying to comfort her.</p><p>""Sir? What's this smell?""</p><p>""What smell?"" the men answered wiping his tears.</p><p>""This is ammonia. Sir! This is ammonia! Open all the windows! Now!"" the paramedic jumped over a couch right to the main window of the room and opened it wide after that ran to the entrance and opened the door. In the meantime Attila went in the back and opened the other door and every window he found in his path.</p><p>""Why does it smell like ammonia in the house? What were you doing?"" meeting in the hallway.</p><p>""I think it smells like chlorine too"" the other paramedic yelled from the other room.</p><p>"" I don't know... I didn't know it smells like ammonia. I work with it at the factory and I don't smell it anymore.""</p><p>""Quick, we need to assess the toddler""</p><p>""Otty? Otty!""</p><p>Both men rushed in the living room and their worst fear was in front of them: the boy was lying on the floor hardly breathing.</p><p>""Otty!"" the father yelled and kneel by him.</p><p>The scream brought back from the mourning trance the mom which froze with her eyes on what was happening a couple of feet away from her.</p><p>""Nooooo!"" the mom let out an angry yell.</p><p>The second paramedic just came from the bedroom after he took care of the baby and embraced her to restrain and comfort her.</p><p>The two men were down on the floor and trying to not panic.</p><p>""Hey buddy, what's your name?"" the paramedic asked.</p><p>""Otty..."" the father answered whispering.</p><p>""I asked him. Please...""</p><p>""Oh. I am sorry.""</p><p>""So, what's your name?""</p><p>""Otty..."" the boy answered with a fainted voice.</p><p>""And how old are you?"" the man asked while he was caring on taking everything that would restrain the boys breathing off.</p><p>""Two..."" the boy let the word out not moving his lips.</p><p>Elena calmed down for a second and when she felt that the paramedic's grip relaxed, she jumped and joined the men on the floor.</p><p>""Otty, come on, baby, don't do this. Stay with mommy. Please baby. Stay with mommy."" She was trying to be strong for him. She wiped her tears and showed her face with a forced smile so the boy can grab on the hope and stay lucid.</p><p>""Ma'am..."" the paramedic looked at her, but the look he got back showed him that she's determined to be there and face the situation.</p><p>""My little pilot... we'll buy you a real plane so you can fly high in the sky just as you dreamed."" She was trying to encourage him to stay with them, to think of beautiful things and to not let the situation conquer him.</p><p>""Mommy... I'm flying..."" the boy smiled.</p><p>""What? What did you say, sweetie?"" the woman tried to make him speak louder while the paramedic was running a quick PH test on his saliva.</p><p>""I'm flyin'..."" the boy let the whisper out with a last breath.</p><p>Even that she was exhausted, she let a scream out that made everyone cringe. Her face darkens and her veins were bursting through her skin.</p><p>""No! No no no no no! Otty! Not you too! Aaaaaaaaah! No! This is not happening! This is not happening!""</p><p>The paramedic put his ear on the boy's chest while he grabbed his wrist to check for pulse. No vital signs. Even he couldn't believe the situation. When he started his shift he was prepared for everything but not for this.</p><p>Attila cringed his teeth and tilted his head trying to not do the same thing like his wife. Muffled, he let out a grown like a lion in pain. He got up and went to his wife, got her in his arms and held her tight. Their family was gone. Now they were just two of them. They were crying in each other’s arms while the paramedics were caring the little ones to the ambulance. She barred her face in his chest looking for comfort, but in these moments nothing and no one could comfort her. His shirt was soaked in her tears. He was caressing her hair and holding her tight, leaning his forehead on her head.</p><p>""Sir, I am sorry"" the lead paramedic approached them wiping his tears. Even that he was trained to deal with any situations, this touched him deeply. ""You will need to come with us at the hospital for paperwork and wait for the authorities to take a deposition at their office""</p><p>He lifts his head up and nodded while his eyes stopped on the washing machine. The thought that settled that moment in his mind made him cringe. His face was petrified.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","Hello and thank you for visiting my campaign.I’ve been working on this book for 2 years nowAnd it’s almost finished and now I feel is the timeTo get some investors on board.I have a part of the budget ready it’s just thatThis way the book would be published faster. And as you know it all goes into producing,Publishing and distributing the book. It’s based on a true story of a soul that pushed through life in spite of the ruthless curse that chased her to the last breath. I tell everyone that it’s a book that will make you cry, laugh and cry again. Have a look in the description.I shared one chapter to get a taste of it.Heres’s the set up:Her life was getting better and now she was married with a lovely man, they settled in a nice apartment and just brought home their new born.

She was feeding the little one in the bedroom, her husband that she loves so much was playing with their first born in the living room, it was a nice sunny day, the spring was on its way finally after the long gloomy winter, the air was fresh, the little one was home, everything was just great. All this made her close her eyes and let a big smile flourish with joy. The sun was warming up her face. It was such a good feeling.""Mommy.."" Otty appeared in the door frame.""Yes sweetie"" the woman barely mumbled trying to come back from her dreamy stance.""Daniel""""Who?""""Daniel. This is how we should call him"" the boy said entering the room and coming closer to the bed to see his brother's face.""Oh. You mean to name him Daniel? That's a nice name. Hmmm... Sounds like a good idea. We'll need to ask daddy to see if he wants too.""""Daddy said yes!"" the boy replied enthusiastic while the man showed up in the frame. She looked at him with wondering eyes and he nodded.""Then Daniel it is! Welcome home Daniel!"" she said with no fear that the baby will wake up. She knew he's sound asleep. He usually does after a good meal.""Otty, go in the living room and find some nice cartoons on TV. I have to do something and I'll come to sit with you. Honey, I'll let you have a nap if you need one. We'll be quiet for a while.""""Thank you sweetie. You're the best husband ever. No wonder I chased you down like a lamb at Easter time. Ok. I think this time I will just snuggle with... Daniel. You know what? I like it. It sounds good. Otty's a smart kid and he has a big heart. I love that boy. What a blessing. Ok. I will just lay back here with him.""""No problem. That's why I am here and that's why... I let you chase me. I wanted you to catch me.""""You're funny... “the woman said with a whisper that almost dissipated in the air before it reached him.He got closer, caressed her and kissed her forehead.""Sweet dreams. I'll go take care of some business. Make you a little surprise. You know... for my girl."" He straighten up, took a moment to take in the beautiful picture of mother and baby, tilted his head with an emotional smile and slowly backed out of the room.""Ok Otty. Watch these cartoons until I come back.""""Where are you going daddy? You're going to work?""""No. It's Saturday. It's week-end. Why do you think we had time to play the morning? You know usually you don't see me in the morning because I am at work long before you're even waking up. No. I just need to prepare a little surprise for mommy when she wakes up. You know, it's nice to do nice things for the ones you love...""""And you love mommy! Yey!""The man made the boy a sign to tone it down so the other half of the family can get some well-deserved rest.""I will not be long. Watch the cartoons.""He shuffled the boy’s hair and left the room smiling. Yes, it felt so good to be with his family, with his lovely wife that he's adoring from the first moment he saw her, with his son that is growing up and, at just two years old, he's so loving and smart and cares so much of the world and his family, with his newborn that just came home a couple of days ago and made his family a whole. His smile was an involuntary one, a smile that was stubborn to stay on his face  for a long time. That's the smile that he was wishing that everyone would experience and keep it for as long as they live.Ho opened the door to the garage and head to the car, popped the trunk and pulled out a plastic garbage bag. It didn't look too heavy but it was pretty bulky. He brought the bag in and head to the laundry room, opened the washing machine and poured the contents in it, switched the dial of the machine, poured some detergent and CLOROX and got it going. The feel good smile slightly morphed in a satisfaction one knowing that she will be pleased with what he just did.""Hey Otty, I'll make some breakfast. What do you want to eat?"" he asked once he got in the living room. He knew already he made a mistake asking a toddler what he wants to eat for breakfast. He almost lip synced what the boy said: “peanut butter and jelly sandwich with milk"".""Can we eat here, daddy?"" the boy added quickly to be sure his daddy heard him and that he will agree on bringing the breakfast in front of the TV.""You know what? It's Saturday. For sure! We need to feel like week-end""""Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeey!"" the boy whispered pretending to be loud from his body language.The man's smile morphed again, but this time in an amused one. He always wondered where he is coming up with all these behaviors and ideas. He was proud of his son. He always wanted boys and God gave him two now. Yes, he had double trouble... * ""Ok. Here it is. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for the royal pilots. After such a rough landing I think we are entitled to treat ourselves from the royal kitchen with the best chef's specialty.""""You forgot the milk daddy"" the boy said laughing at his dad's silliness.""Oh, my dear commander, you're right. I will go fetch it right now. But before I go, may I ask how you would like your milk? In a cup or in a bottle?""""Daddy, you're funny"" the boy said and slipped into the character ""Please bring me a cup, Sir! I am not a baby anymore. I am a royal commander air-force pilot and I deserved to be treated like a man!""The boy's reply made the man burst in a suppressed laughter. He was trying to keep quiet, but the boy was way too funny. He loves him so much. He wished his father would've been that goofy with him when he was a kid, but it didn't happen. Now he seized the opportunity and he made the best of it and it paid off. These moments are priceless. * She opened her eyes slowly like being afraid that the air moved by her eyelashes will wake the little one. Such a cozy feeling. The coffee smell was still lingering around the home and she wanted one so badly. Daniel was still sleeping. Quiet. Peaceful. Just seeing his face brought her a smile. She couldn't believe that her life turned around so good and in such a good direction. Here she was lying down with her precious newborn, in the living room was the man that rescued her, her knight with shiny helmet because he didn't have an armor at the time, with her first born which, in her eyes, was a genius. What more could she ask from life? Oh. Coffee. Right. *""Hey, I'll go check on the laundry. I'll be right back""""Ok daddy."" the boy barely mumbled chewing on the peanut butter sandwich.While Otty was absorbed by the funny cartoons that they were watching, Attila went in the laundry to check on the load. Opened the washing machine. Everything was looking good and white. He put a little more Clorox to make sure they will be bright when she sees them. *His face was so peaceful. His eyes were closed but his eyelashes were so fragile, so delicate, his nose was so tiny and squishy, his lips were like sculpted by an artist. Here she was, falling in love again. For the third time. This time with Daniel, the little baby that was starting his life in such a loving family. She couldn't stop staring at him, at every details of his face, at every little hair on his tiny head, at the almost see trough tiny ears, at the little chicks that were budging every time when he would cry or smile. She's lucky. He did smile sometimes to her and not because he was gassy.The peace in the room was so comforting. It’s the first time she felt like that since the birth. She really needed a break like this so she can regain herself and her mind, herself.She would like to wake him up so she can get her well-deserved coffee, but she didn’t want to spoil the moment. It was too precious to be selfish. Now she was sharing this with him just how she will share her whole life with him. She is his mother until her last breath.He was lying there so still and so peaceful, so quiet and so calm.She couldn’t help herself and she needed to caress him. Her finger gently touched his hair and sled down on his temple, down on his ear and on his chick. He was sleeping. She was hoping to not wake him up. Because he didn’t react to her touch, she felt accomplished. She was able to love him without disturbing him. And again she got lost in staring at his little being lying there resting: his eyes, his nose, his mouth… so cute and fragile, his little body cuddled up under the thing blanket. Not a sound, not a move. Not a move?She pulled her head back to be able to have a full view of him, touched his forehead, sled her fingers on his chick. Nothing. She didn’t want to freak out. It might just be an illusion. She softly pinched his ear… Nothing. She let a desperate scream out of her lungs which, like a thunder, filled and shook the house in a split second.“What?” the husband appeared in the door with big eyes and his heart pumping.“The baby!” the woman barely made sense of her mumbling“What?!” he came closer while she got the little one in her arms. He wasn’t responsive.“I think he’s dead” she cried and looking around with desperation tried to find ways to cater to the newborn.“No. It can’t be.”The man approached to look closer and see how he can help. Both of them were panicked. Otty showed up and joined the emotional whirlpool not understanding exactly what’s happening, but being influenced by the cry that flood the house.Her tears we’re blurring her vision. She was lost. She took Daniel and snuggled him in close to her heart to keep him comfortable. Maybe he can hear her heart beating and that will get him to know that mommy is there for him. Attila picked up the phone and called the Emergency. Otty was crying holding to his leg. While he was waiting for an answer, the man picked him up and held him in his arms. The toddler was crying on his shoulder and hugging him strong with his little arms. The operator picked up. ""911, what is your emergency?""""Quick! My newborn is not moving. We need an ambulance fast!""""Sir, did you check for pulse?""""I don't know how. It's a newborn. He's small. Where do I do that?""""Sir, did you listen for a heartbeat?""""No..."" turning to her ""can you please listen for a beat?""She was holding the little one as cozy as a mother can hold her precious baby and she was afraid to disturb him. She went to the bed, lay him there and put her ear close to his chest. She was hoping. Even that the tiny chest wasn't really moving, she was hoping to hear something. Nothing. Her cry intensified and looked around not knowing what to do. Even that she was a strong women, this was a blow that she couldn't take. Right now she wished she was six feet underground or never born. The pain was tearing every cell of her body and it came out in a yell that wished to crush the injustice.He was standing there with the phone to the ear and his son in his arms. He was speechless. The hope left him and now he was realizing that the one that they just brought from the hospital a couple of days ago, was gone, that their new addition to the family wasn't anymore, that the little sparkle of joy that brought her laughter and hope, died.""Sir?... Sir? Are you still there?""The man grabbed his son stronger in his arms trying to calm him down. Even that he didn't really knew what's happening, Otty was feeling the atmosphere in the room, he was picking up from his mother and he was bulging.""Sir?!? I need you to talk to me.""""Yes..."" he answered in between the desperate voices that were letting out the anger, the anxiety, the sorrow and the forsaken feelings all combined in a mash of rage.""I am here... Please send an ambulance. I think it's too late...""He put down the phone and, trying to keep strong in front of his family, held his tears and went to his wife to comfort her. When he got closer and watched the little one lying on the bed, knowing the he's gone, he just burst in a man cry. He loved his family and as much as he tried to be strong for them in those moment he couldn't hold back his feelings. Fell on his knees beside his wife, put his arm around her and leaned over the little baby. They were all crying. The air was filled with hurt.A strong and rushed knock on the door threw him out of the morning stance. The loud bangs were covering the cries. He left Otty by his mom and went to open.""Hello Sir. We received an emergency call from you. Where is the baby?""""This way"" he rushed to show them to the bedroom.""Ma'am, please step back. We need to assess the baby"".The paramedic started the procedure while the family was watching helplessly.""Can I please ask to go in the living room? I need some space and get to some procedures that don't look too good from outside. Thank you""They got out of the room and head to the living room. Their faces were red and hot. The mixture of feelings was so confusing that they felt drained.The man kept working around the baby trying to find ways to find out if he's really gone or he can do something to bring him back, to wake him up. He didn't get a pulse or a heartbeat, a breath, or any vital sign so he moved to CPR.""Come on, you little one, help me out here. I can't do it myself. I need your will to live. You have a full life in front of you. You need to live it. Don't just go out"" the man was thinking while he was continuing the procedure.The family was trying to calm down in the living room. The other paramedic was trying to help with some cold compresses for their foreheads and with some water to, at least, take their toughs away from the worst case scenario.Finally the officer came out of the bedroom.""I am really sorry... He's gone""Elena burst again in a wild cry and fell on the floor crawling in the fetus position. Her husband grabbed the toddler and sled down by her trying to comfort her.""Sir? What's this smell?""""What smell?"" the men answered wiping his tears.""This is ammonia. Sir! This is ammonia! Open all the windows! Now!"" the paramedic jumped over a couch right to the main window of the room and opened it wide after that ran to the entrance and opened the door. In the meantime Attila went in the back and opened the other door and every window he found in his path.""Why does it smell like ammonia in the house? What were you doing?"" meeting in the hallway.""I think it smells like chlorine too"" the other paramedic yelled from the other room."" I don't know... I didn't know it smells like ammonia. I work with it at the factory and I don't smell it anymore.""""Quick, we need to assess the toddler""""Otty? Otty!""Both men rushed in the living room and their worst fear was in front of them: the boy was lying on the floor hardly breathing.""Otty!"" the father yelled and kneel by him.The scream brought back from the mourning trance the mom which froze with her eyes on what was happening a couple of feet away from her.""Nooooo!"" the mom let out an angry yell.The second paramedic just came from the bedroom after he took care of the baby and embraced her to restrain and comfort her.The two men were down on the floor and trying to not panic.""Hey buddy, what's your name?"" the paramedic asked.""Otty..."" the father answered whispering.""I asked him. Please...""""Oh. I am sorry.""""So, what's your name?""""Otty..."" the boy answered with a fainted voice.""And how old are you?"" the man asked while he was caring on taking everything that would restrain the boys breathing off.""Two..."" the boy let the word out not moving his lips.Elena calmed down for a second and when she felt that the paramedic's grip relaxed, she jumped and joined the men on the floor.""Otty, come on, baby, don't do this. Stay with mommy. Please baby. Stay with mommy."" She was trying to be strong for him. She wiped her tears and showed her face with a forced smile so the boy can grab on the hope and stay lucid.""Ma'am..."" the paramedic looked at her, but the look he got back showed him that she's determined to be there and face the situation.""My little pilot... we'll buy you a real plane so you can fly high in the sky just as you dreamed."" She was trying to encourage him to stay with them, to think of beautiful things and to not let the situation conquer him.""Mommy... I'm flying..."" the boy smiled.""What? What did you say, sweetie?"" the woman tried to make him speak louder while the paramedic was running a quick PH test on his saliva.""I'm flyin'..."" the boy let the whisper out with a last breath.Even that she was exhausted, she let a scream out that made everyone cringe. Her face darkens and her veins were bursting through her skin.""No! No no no no no! Otty! Not you too! Aaaaaaaaah! No! This is not happening! This is not happening!""The paramedic put his ear on the boy's chest while he grabbed his wrist to check for pulse. No vital signs. Even he couldn't believe the situation. When he started his shift he was prepared for everything but not for this.Attila cringed his teeth and tilted his head trying to not do the same thing like his wife. Muffled, he let out a grown like a lion in pain. He got up and went to his wife, got her in his arms and held her tight. Their family was gone. Now they were just two of them. They were crying in each other’s arms while the paramedics were caring the little ones to the ambulance. She barred her face in his chest looking for comfort, but in these moments nothing and no one could comfort her. His shirt was soaked in her tears. He was caressing her hair and holding her tight, leaning his forehead on her head.""Sir, I am sorry"" the lead paramedic approached them wiping his tears. Even that he was trained to deal with any situations, this touched him deeply. ""You will need to come with us at the hospital for paperwork and wait for the authorities to take a deposition at their office""He lifts his head up and nodded while his eyes stopped on the washing machine. The thought that settled that moment in his mind made him cringe. His face was petrified.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h2><strong>FROM THE AUTHOR</strong></h2>
</div>
<p>I loved the idea of writing the legend of Sirena the Mermaid in a rhyming children’s book, not only for the lyrical quality of rhyme, but because it is also so beneficial for children's cognitive development. I have included extra features like vocabulary words and discussion themes to help enrich the reading and bonding experience. I feel so honored telling Sirena's story in a new way.  - <a href=""http://amatterofrhyme.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Sheri Wall<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553781168/vsswajg0fkiehmswkq2u.jpg"" src=""""/></i></a></p>
<h2>FROM THE ILLUSTRATOR</h2>
<p>I've illustrated several of Sheri Wall's books and couldn't be more excited when she told me she wrote a book about a mermaid! Sheri turned this native American tale into a clever rhyme and I was honored to add the artwork to this project. The story has a lovely and mystic ambiance, which I wanted to portray in vibrant watercolor. -<a href=""http://lankyartist.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> <i>Ilona Stuijt</i></a></p>
<h2>FROM THE SCULPTOR</h2>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/326229474?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>One of my favorite sayings is ""art begets art."" Art's transformative power is accomplished through many forms, whether it be storytelling, sculpting, painting, or poetry.  This children’s book project truly exemplifies that saying. I'm thrilled to have Sirena's legend transformed in rhyme. Growing up in Texas, I would beg my Grandmother Kelley to tell me the story of Sirena over and over again. That story inspired me to create the life-size bronze sculpture of Sirena the Mermaid and place her in Salado Creek. I’m delighted folks are still excited to come see her. - <a href=""http://troysculptor.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Troy Kelley</i></a></p>

<div><h2>RISK &amp; CHALLENGES</h2></div>
<div>
<p>As we have taken our time in preparing beautiful art, carefully editing text, and getting various printing quotes, we don't foresee many risks or challenges. However: </p>
<ul>
<li>Printing could be delayed due to circumstances beyond our control, although our goal is to begin printing as soon as the funds from the campaign are received.</li>
<li>Timely delivery of your book in July 2019 is our goal. If there's a delay, we will contact all supporters to keep you informed. </li>
<li>There's always a level of uncertainty with any endeavor, somewhat like the outcome of Sirena's deal with a catfish. </li>

FROM THE AUTHOR

I loved the idea of writing the legend of Sirena the Mermaid in a rhyming children’s book, not only for the lyrical quality of rhyme, but because it is also so beneficial for children's cognitive development. I have included extra features like vocabulary words and discussion themes to help enrich the reading and bonding experience. I feel so honored telling Sirena's story in a new way.  - Sheri Wall
FROM THE ILLUSTRATOR
I've illustrated several of Sheri Wall's books and couldn't be more excited when she told me she wrote a book about a mermaid! Sheri turned this native American tale into a clever rhyme and I was honored to add the artwork to this project. The story has a lovely and mystic ambiance, which I wanted to portray in vibrant watercolor. - Ilona Stuijt
FROM THE SCULPTOR

One of my favorite sayings is ""art begets art."" Art's transformative power is accomplished through many forms, whether it be storytelling, sculpting, painting, or poetry.  This children’s book project truly exemplifies that saying. I'm thrilled to have Sirena's legend transformed in rhyme. Growing up in Texas, I would beg my Grandmother Kelley to tell me the story of Sirena over and over again. That story inspired me to create the life-size bronze sculpture of Sirena the Mermaid and place her in Salado Creek. I’m delighted folks are still excited to come see her. - Troy Kelley

RISK & CHALLENGES

As we have taken our time in preparing beautiful art, carefully editing text, and getting various printing quotes, we don't foresee many risks or challenges. However: 

Printing could be delayed due to circumstances beyond our control, although our goal is to begin printing as soon as the funds from the campaign are received.
Timely delivery of your book in July 2019 is our goal. If there's a delay, we will contact all supporters to keep you informed. 
There's always a level of uncertainty with any endeavor, somewhat like the outcome of Sirena's deal with a catfish.",3.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>The Project</strong></h3>
<p>My daughter Emma and I are currently working on our second film together, KOANS, a video poetry short telling the story of my mother, Janet Gilmore's life long struggle with anorexia/bulimia. Our script is edited from her essay/journal on living with the disease. Weaved throughout is my mother’s short ""mood"" poetry that she used to express her state of being and yearning for health/peace.</p>
<p>I shared this poetry with Emma the Summer of 2017 when she was 15 and she surprised me by creating illustrations to poems that particularly spoke to her. Janet passed away at 70-years old when Emma was 6-months old. The poetry and illustrations have been a profound connection between a grandmother and granddaughter who only met once and inspired the film along with the aim of my mother and myself to support awareness of the impact of eating disorders and connect those suffering to support.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1: Poetry Book &amp; Audio Production</strong></h3>
<p>We are currently in production of an audio podcast/version of the book featuring an amazing group of readers who  graciously offered their voices to bring my mom’s story to life. Each of our talented voice actors have a personal connection to themes within Janet's writings and chose poems that have personal relevance adding to the emotion and sincerity to their interpretation and expression of Janet's words.</p>
<p>We invite you to partner in this important project and consider helping us finance recording studio time, license music and support publication costs of the poetry and illustrations. From those productions, we hope to obtain further funding to make the film a reality.</p>
<p>All profits beyond production costs for the book will be donated to The Diatribe, an incredible West Michigan organization using performing arts to empower young people to share their stories, raise awareness of social issues, and create change within their communities.</p>
<p>Thank you for following this project and we look forward to keeping you all updated of our progress! Brian &amp; Emma</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
</div><div>
<p>If we can raise $2500, we will have the necessary funds to self-publish 50 copies of Koans, license music for our audio production and pay for the studio time of the incredible voice talent that we have already recorded.</p>
<p>We are in a fantastic position to make this production a reality. Over 100 hours have been put into the production including: arranging the poetry and journal essay with Emma's poignant and heart-wrenching illustrations completed for each poem, all readings have been recorded, the music is selected and our first draft of the audio production is completed.</p>
<p>Immediate costs include: </p>
<ul>
<li>$1000 dollars to license music from Audio Network.</li>
<li>$500 to pay for our studio time (reduced fees from our engineers) to cover all readings and additional music.</li>
<li>$700 to Village Books for our ISDN and 50 copies of the book (plus additional support services).</li>
<li>$300 for digital images of artwork and additional misc. costs</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We feel the presentation of Janet's writings about her lifelong struggle with anorexia from the 1940's through her loss with this battle in 2002 represents an incredibly raw and sincere look at an individual's experience with an eating disorder. With what was originally an assignment from her therapist, she has left a gift of her expression, allowing a glimpse from the inside out into a lifetime battle with an eating disorder. It is Emma’s and my hope that by sharing these poems and illustrations, my mother’s expression may provide some insight, empathy and understanding for those suffering from an eating disorder.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by supporting our production costs, you help the project to move into an immediate profit generating opportunity with all proceeds from the book going to The Diatribe which is making incredible impacts with youth and young adults.</p>

Over 100 hours have been put into the production including: arranging the poetry and journal essay with Emma's poignant and heart-wrenching illustrations completed for each poem, all readings have been recorded, the music is selected and our first draft of the audio production is completed.
Immediate costs include: 

$1000 dollars to license music from Audio Network.
$500 to pay for our studio time (reduced fees from our engineers) to cover all readings and additional music.
$700 to Village Books for our ISDN and 50 copies of the book (plus additional support services).
$300 for digital images of artwork and additional misc. costs


The Impact
We feel the presentation of Janet's writings about her lifelong struggle with anorexia from the 1940's through her loss with this battle in 2002 represents an incredibly raw and sincere look at an individual's experience with an eating disorder. With what was originally an assignment from her therapist, she has left a gift of her expression, allowing a glimpse from the inside out into a lifetime battle with an eating disorder. It is Emma’s and my hope that by sharing these poems and illustrations, my mother’s expression may provide some insight, empathy and understanding for those suffering from an eating disorder.
Furthermore, by supporting our production costs, you help the project to move into an immediate profit generating opportunity with all proceeds from the book going to The Diatribe which is making incredible impacts with youth and young adults.

Other Ways You Can Help
We realize not everyone can make a financial contribution. However, please help us spread the word out about this production. Sharing project links and encouraging support from your social network is invaluable to our efforts to bring this story to life and support health and recovery.

<h3>Book Summary</h3>
<p>This book will be a collection of fine art portraits of the (over 30) musicians I have 'interviewed' and there will be three main segments ""Our Music, Our Mountains, Our Memories"". So I will also be sharing the landscape of our mountains and essays of local farmers, coal miners and just good mountain folk.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have been an portrait artist literally since I was a child. I sketched faces on my etch-a-sketch, in school, and anywhere I could find a clean sheet of paper! As I grew older and began using the camera as a reference tool, folks began to compliment me on my photography! When digital hit and I had a way to combine my art skills with photography , via Photoshop. I met my passion ! I have also loved to write , since I was a child, so I guess you could say this book has been hiding dormant in me since my early years and now I have a chance to release it to grow into full realization !</li>
<li>This project is very special to me because of my memories as a child , when I first heard my Grandmother, Helen Hunley, singing at the clothesline. (Which is the main title for my book ). She always sang, as she worked and I recall how spellbound I was, as I stood beside her, as a little girl, handing her clothespins and seeing her smiling up at the heavens and belting out old hymns, such as ""The Old Rugged Cross"" and ""Amazing Grace"". It struck a chord in me that I will never forget. How , she would hum to herself as she 'snapped peas' on the porch and wistfully look out the window, as she did the dishes, always humming her favorite tunes, as though a she was the embodiment of a living prayer and her singing was her personal church. It taught me to enjoy my chores, with music in my head, and to see the blessings in our every day life and routine. <br/>This to me, is how our early music was passed on through the generations and how it is still alive today. From Clothesline to clothesline , porch to porch and from the old timers to the new youth of today!</li>
<li>How can you help me achieve my goal of completing and publishing this book? <br/>I have been working hard on this book since 2010. I have traveled and visited many folks and have conducted over 30 interviews. (Many at the Reed Creek Farm in Wytheville, so special thanks to the Wassum family ). I have given a gift of prints to all those I have interviewed as a way of saying ""Thanks "" . I sincerely do appreciate all the musicians, who have contributed their time and those who lent a song for the CD to accompany this project.<br/>Your contribution will enable me the time and space to get down to the business of transposing all the interviews and get the entire writing process done (Now that the portraits, landscape photography and 'most' of interviews have been completed ) . The funds will pay for the many expenses of travel, time off to write, and of course the actual cost of publishing a high quality photography book !<br/>I want to make every one of you very proud that you helped to make this happen and I want you to be able to hold the actual completed book and feel as fulfilled as I am , that this project produced a book rich in stories, antidotes, and poignant memories that we can all connect to and feel a sense of family and belonging that we all came together and made happen!<br/>I could not ever do this without your encouragement, inspiration and kind assistance and I am very grateful for your help !<br/>With humble appreciation , I thank you all sincerely!<br/>Susi</li>

<h3>What This Project Needs &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Breaking it Down:</p>
<ul>
<li>The estimate cost I received for photo quality printing of 200 books will be around $15,000</li>
<li>I am offering a lot of cool perks, if you are not ready to buy the book, then purchasing a perk will still help me fund the cost of printing and , of course also help me pay for the cost of the perks! Some of the perks are : Original posters, pertaining to the subject of the book theme!<br/>T-shirts with the book title, subtitle and graphics ! A CD with 12-15 songs of some of the awesome musicians I have interviewed for the book ! My 2009 Kodak Award winner book of portraits ""'Simple Wisdom'! A solid Mahogany Baby Taylor guitar , signed by all the musicians in the book !!<br/> </li>
<li>If I do not reach my goal, you will still get any perks you ordered and you will still receive any books you ordered , because I will find a way to make it happen! Yes, I am a positive thinker and doer !</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Why this project matters !</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe in this book project, because I believe in Our Music, Our Mountains and Our Memories ! I know that the conversations with our area musicians and other folks, are one of great connections and a positive reinforcement of our life, here in the Appalachian Mountains. We are a unique blend of organic, hard working, good solid folks here and I think this book will be a great reminder of that and something to return to , flip through and revisit the portraits, landscapes and memories so dear to us all. You don't have to know the folks in the pages , to feel a sense of kinship, good will and a sense of family that we have and feel here.</li>
<li>It has taken me many years to seek out all the musicians, with travel and timing around my occupation as a portrait photographer. But, I now have everything completed, but the writing ! That part will come to me and flow along fine in the coming months. (Especially Winter , when my photography business slows to a crawl. This will give me the solitude and time I need !) This project, of course, is also a very personal one. I have always wanted to create a beautiful book of photography and text and now, I am finally seeing this dream come to fruition! It's a fantastic feeling and my daughter is very proud of me! As a single Mom, of  26 years, that makes me feel pretty darn good!</li>
<li>My Photography motto is , ""You can trust me with your memories "" and that's also how I feel about this book. You can trust that this book will be completed , printed, published and mailed to your kind hands!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>I do not perceive any risk to any of my perks ! I plan to print the posters, screen print the t-shirts myself and the music for the CD has been emailed to me and a studio has agreed to create the 'master' for the CD. I designed the CD cover myself and will have those printed online ! The guitar is in my possession and is ready to mail. So, there are no risk for any of the 'extra perks', unless there is an unforeseen calamity !</li>
<li>If I do not receive enough funding to print 200 books, I will use whatever funding I do receive to print the amount that is ordered. Less books cost more, but I will still honor any orders that I receive to the best of my ability. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can not afford to contribute by purchasing a perk or a book, you can help a lot simply by sharing and posting the link to my funding site on any social media platform that you choose! I thank you for this !</p>

<li>Thank you to all the musicians, who agreed to be in my book and took the time, from their busy schedules and share with me a glimpse of their life in which to share with all the readers !

<li>Thank you to the musicians, who sent me their original songs to add to the audio CD perk ""Soft Songs for Hard Times"" I love every song or tune you sent and I appreciate this generosity! I know this CD will be loved by all who hear it !</li>

<li>Thank you to Debbie Larson for kindly inviting me, into her home, to interview Larry McPeak , before his passing. He was not feeling well, but shared his heartfelt memories for many hours and he truly touched my heart. As I went to leave he said to me ""This is going to be a great book and I hope I get to see it before I am gone."" It was then I knew , I would dedicate this book to him and his beautiful legacy.

I hope to come visit y'all again soon !<br/>Thank you to my friend , David Harvey, (now passed) whom I met in 1999 and who helped me to understand how my investment in good gear would improve my portrait photography. He was a portrait master, and I will always miss his advice and friendship.<br/>If I failed to mention anyone ,who has made this project possible , please know you are in my heart and I am grateful for you!<br/><strong>I hope to make you all proud !!! Love y'all !</strong>

ABOUT THE BOOK
More than 85% of all people worldwide identify themselves as either religious or spiritual, meaning that they believe in some form of ""cosmic order of existence"" and carry belief in a  ""Higher Power"", often known under the names of God the Father, Great Mother Goddess, Jehovah, El, Allah, Krishna, The Great Spirit, Cosmic Consciousness, Void, and many other.Although many religious and spiritual notions of God are entirely belief based, there exists a great number of people, born in the 20th and 21st centuries, who have experienced God directly, much in a similar fashion as mystics and prophets of the ancient times did. As Carl Gustav Jung said after his own encounter with the Divine: ""I don't need to believe, I know.""This book which we titled ""Eyes That Have Seen God"" will be an anthology of those experiences, as told by people on various walks of life, sharing their often shattering encounters with the Divine, that happened either through a spontaneous experience, a near-death, prayer, meditation, or psychedelic drug use. In sharing their encounters, they will also convey the metaphysical truths that were revealed to them regarding the meaning of life, love, suffering, good and evil, death, and the afterlife. THE VALIDITY OF MODERN DAY SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCESAccepting the validity of these experiences is somewhat difficult, since modern Western individual is caught between two extreme positions.The rational, scientific, atheist position denies the existence of any ""Higher Power"", and sees God as a relic of our superstitious past that should be entirely replaced by findings of modern science. Experiences of the Divine are seen exclusively as delusions of a faulty brain.On the other hand, the religious position argues that God revealed himself to a number of prophets and mystics more than two millennia ago, and has since remained mostly hidden and inaccessible.

Although profound in their positive effects, these type of experiences are often pathologized by modern psychiatry and therefore only rarely talked about - a trend which we hope this book will help change. 
MODERN DAY ENCOUNTERS WITH THE DIVINE
As the experiences described in this book will show, modern day mystical encounters with the Divine take place not just in places of worship, but in secular places too, including cities, homes and deep inside of nature.Although a great number of these encounters can bring profound comfort, peace, and a sense of meaning, some of them can also be profoundly  shattering, since the experience is so overwhelming that it often threaten preconceived notions of  a comforting, all-loving God as a father- or mother- figure. ""Higher Power"" as encountered personally is often much larger, profound, and complex than people ever imagined and may even be in conflict with the pre-existing religious doctrines one was taught to accept on blind faith.Even so these experiences eventually do confirm the existence of a ""Higher Power"" and its everyday presence in this world, as well as the ultimate recognition of Love as an intrinsic force that is ever present behind the world's material mask and the ultimate goodness and redemption of each and every human being.These discoveries, which you will be able to read about in the book, will hopefully bring a renewed sense of purpose both to your life and to your on-going spiritual quest.

Our aim is to provide insightful contents aimed at anyone interested in this magical world. We do not want to be too academic but we also wish to change the perspective that the Islamic world is only beautiful, as we genuinely feel that there its history is deep in interesting facts. This is why IWA mag is aimed at a wide public: both specialists and amateurs can enjoy our contents.So far, the magazine has been published exclusively online, open access. What we want to do is to reach a wider public and start to print out the future issues.WE ARE TWO YOUNG PROFESSIONALS, SURROUNDED BY GREAT COLLABORATORS. Our names are Giulia Gallini and Sara Ibrahim: based in Amsterdam and Milan. Giulia is an expert in Islamic history of art, and Sara is a professional in the editorial world. We met in Venice (Italy), at the University, where we studied Arabic language together but specialized in different fields. With our combined passion we naturally became friends and decided to join forces to create IWA Islamic World of Art.Over the years we have worked with many talented individuals on this project: graphic designers, web geeks, editors, authors and photographers.WE NEED YOU because so far IWA Islamic World of Art has been a completely self-funded magazine. We and our collaborators have invested our time (and savings) in the magazine, and we want it to flourish.We are proud to be independent and not to be affiliated with any bigger editorial corporation, and we want to remain so. This is why we want to raise the seed capital that will allow us to grow with a crowdfunding campaign.WITH THE MONEY WE RAISE WE WILL first of all start to print and distribute the magazine in bookshops and museums.

<p><strong>Who Are We?</strong><br/>MEOW is being founded by Katy Gierlach and Jared McKinley, who are no strangers to publishing. Having participated on many levels in local magazines, including the launch of one of the more successful periodicals in Tucson, we know what it takes to get a new publication going. However, we are aiming to do it a bit differently than it has been done in the past.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495737182/lggdkgs1yl8qrcqifueb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>All of us at MEOW are lovers of this region. We live here because of the border, not despite. This place is special not just because of its rich history and culture; the modern borderlands is a place imbued with a creative and innovative spirit. And we feel that the region has been misrepresented, our problems embellished and exaggerated for political purposes at the cost of our local economies. We want to push back, and profile the region for what it really is.</p>
<p><strong>TESTIMONIALS</strong><br/>Frank Williams, FWD Design<br/>“<i>Jared and Katy are two of the hardest working and creative, yet grounded, entrepreneurs I have met. Never afraid to shake things up, their passion and love for everything in our community is ever present and their love for food, gardening and sustainable practices are unmatched. It is truly refreshing to be with like-minded folks and I am blessed to have them as friends, and business colleagues. Their newest venture will prove to be just what we need in the Southern Arizona community with a fresh perspective that will appeal to the masses…they are as real as it gets.</i>”</p>

<p><strong>THE MAGAZINE</strong><br/>MEOW Magazine promises to be different than anything out there right meow. For starters, we are investing in our digital presence FIRST -- this means more than having a few blog entries, reposts of our print stories, and a smattering of postings on Facebook. For MEOW Magazine, taking our digital presence seriously means developing a program set up specifically to finance and publish regular multimedia posts: not just articles, but video, podcasts, photo essays, and more. And we believe in paying our contributors fairly for the work they produce.</p>
<p>And we aren’t leaving print behind. In fact, we think we have made some innovations in our print products as well. We will be producing lots of smaller publications focussed on specific subjects and targeted at specific audiences. There will also, eventually, be a full quarterly publication, distributed statewide.</p>
<p>We have restructured our advertising program to get away from the distracting, noisy nature that traditional advertising environments are, to become something more entertaining, useful, and congruent with the editorial. We are curating those advertisers, and designing the ad environment to be a service to the reader, rather than an hassle. <i>Ads don’t have to suck</i>.</p>

<p>MEOW Magazine, as the name might also imply, aims at having a younger, more edgy and fun tone. If you want the younger audience, you should speak in a way that resonates with them, use technology that they respond to, and you should hire a lot of young people.</p>
<p>Many people ask us, “Why MEOW Magazine?” It’s simple. MEOW is fun, lends itself to lots of language play, and is visually suggestive and memorable.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495737485/r8ldlnxf7uqvn9xkyvzd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>MEOW Magazine is a product of MEOW MEOW Media, LLC. We believe in implementing our marketing triumvirate plan for all we produce, which involves print media, digital media, and event production.</p>
<p><strong>THE EDITORIAL</strong><br/>We are covering a wide range of subjects, separated into 6 categories:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Prowl</strong><br/>This is everything in the hood, outside the home: dining out, nightlife, stories on local retail shops, profiles of local movers and shakers, events, and calendars that help you find all the fun stuff happening in town.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Casa</strong><br/>Local lifestyle is unique because of our climate and our multicultural influences. In this section we cover cooking, gardening, home improvement, self care, and give tips on living well in the desert, all with a regional emphasis.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Arts</strong><br/>Arizona is rich in art and we aim to cover the gamut: visual arts, music (both modern and classical), dance, performance art, stage, and the literary arts.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Tour</strong><br/>Outside of Tucson there is a lot to do: we want you to explore your backyard, see all the beautiful towns in Arizona and just beyond, explore the wonderful nature we have, and find all the outdoor activities that enrich our lives and improve our health and mental well-being.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Region</strong><br/>There is much to cover when it comes to history, culture, natural history, and all the things that really define who we are. The stories about this region, whether they occurred a hundred years ago or a decade ago, are always fascinating. And who has more a more iconic landscape than we do, with our saguaros, ocotillos, and prickly pear?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Civics</strong><br/>We hope to guide our readers toward being good citizens: we want to help our audience be aware of local political issues, community stories, provide opportunities for civic engagement and volunteerism, and more. We hope to help our readers make educated decisions when voting, and help them understand all the current issues that require citizen input, support, or resistance. And we encourage our readers to watch where they put their money. </p>
<p><strong>THE BUSINESS</strong><br/>We have designed our magazine not only to succeed, but to reward the right people. All too often local media companies are top-heavy. When profits accrue, they usually go upward to pay for overhead, please shareholders, and the first elements to get cut when things get tough are the people who contribute the actual content.</p>
<p>We think this is wrong. So, we intend on staying independent -- we will not use traditional investors to fund this magazine nor take out big loans. Instead, we are content to grow slowly and surely. So far this has been beneficial to us because it has given us more time to plan, to budget, and to consider everything we are doing.</p>
<p>This is also why we decided to use crowdfunding. At first, like many, we were leery of crowdfunding. But we realized that our aim to be devoted to our audience (not shareholders or investors) makes us a perfect match for crowdfunding -- which is quite literally going to our audience for support. We are beholden to you.</p>
<p>We will be funding our company through our innovative ad program, which we have designed to be, as stated above, useful to the reader as much as it is useful to the advertiser. We have an extensive menu of products that we will draw upon to create packages, customized for each advertiser or advertising group. And we have created products for everyone: from the smallest to the largest local businesses. And we are always local first!</p>
<p>We are a modern, mobile company. Technology enables us to eschew the needs for an office, a needless expense that can drag on media companies. When needed, we have collaborators that can provide studio spaces for video and photo shoots. Most of our work is done in cafes, or in our living room.</p>
<p>Our profits will always be applied to the people who create the content. Everyone in MEOW Magazine works hard. There are no big bosses, no shareholders draining away profits while contributing little to our output. And as we grow, we will increase the wages of those contributors. Our largest expenses will be paying for our content, and marketing it through social networks, google, print products, events, and other marketing products driving traffic to our website -- all of which also produces profit. Our belief is that the success of our company should go toward the people who create the editorial. After a year of operation, those who have shown adherence to our mission, and have produced consistently, will become shareholders.</p>
<p><strong>OUR IMPACT</strong><br/>Our mission is to connect our audience to the region: the landscape, culture, history, community, arts, people, businesses, events, and opportunities for experience. MEOW is for everyone who lives here, young and old. We are here to present the real borderlands (the historic and the contemporary), and aim to have a positive effect on our local economy, encouraging our audience to spend locally, travel locally, and live locally.</p>
<p>With every project we have been involved with before, we have aimed at bettering our community. We believe regionalism is the only future. And we believe in investing back into our community -- promoting local businesses, using local businesses, we even bank locally with Tucson Federal Credit Union. We use local printers and designers, we shop at local office supply companies, and we work daily to inspire our audience to do the same. Localism and regionalism is perhaps one of the most important movements happening in the 21st century; putting our money toward the businesses and organizations that give back to the local community. Put simply, we are Arizona’s most enthusiastic cheerleaders.</p>
<p><strong>OUR CHALLENGES</strong><br/>Being independent comes with its challenges, which we have prepared for: because we are not relying on investors for our needed boost, we have had to grow slowly. However, maintaining this slower pace has not been without advantages -- we have had more time to carefully orchestrate our business.</p>
<p>As we go public with our ideas, we expect some imitation. We have already experienced this. But while people can borrow ideas, inspiration is impossible to steal, and we never rest on our laurels. We are always working to evolve our products and concepts, staying acutely aware of the changes and needs of the audience. With all that we have already produced, there are always new ideas and products being developed, constantly. The website, magazine, and event designs are never finished.</p>
<p>Katy and Jared have extensive experience and success in creating and selling ad products. But if our ad sales don’t take off right away, we have structured our business to continue to produce, regardless; our overhead is low, and our budget is malleable. We can do a lot with a little bit of money and can respond quickly to changes in sales. Just take a look at what we have done already on our website: everything you see there was done on a shoestring budget. </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong><br/>We are asking for a boost to help us get out there. This is what the money will do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assist the transition of our webpage from beta mode into full production</li>
<li>Pay for printing cost on our first print products.</li>
<li>Help us launch our advertising program (digital and print).</li>
<li>Pay for our content as we transition into full production.</li>
<li>Begin our own marketing program with the use of print products, social media, web marketing, and events.</li>
<li>Help us purchase the needed tools: new computers, cameras, lighting, office supplies, etc.</li>
<li>Pay for materials and tools needed for selling ads.</li>
<li>Pay for needed software used for production, business organization, bookkeeping, and internal and external communication.</li>
<li>Pay for startup web and graphic design and editing.</li>
</ul> <p>Whether or not we reach our goal, the money we raise will still be used on all of the above items, scaled down to accommodate a modified budget that will prioritize paying contributors and selling advertising products.</p> <p><strong>WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO TO SUPPORT US</strong><br/>Besides supporting us with campaign dollars, you can support MEOW Magazine in a number of other ways:</p>

This is the fourth in a series of books featuring immigrant stories recorded by Green Card Voices (GCV). Through this project, we lift up immigrant voices and offer insight into the resources and expertise that these immigrant entrepreneurs have to offer. We have already recorded 15 of the entrepreneur stories and are ready to work on the book and podcasts!Today's political climate is charged and the future of immigration in the United States is in flux. What is certain however, is that those immigrants who are here are among the most entrepreneurial individuals in our nation. They create new companies, provide jobs, and contribute to their communities in countless ways. This project will not only highlight their contributions, it will be an inspirational resource for anyone who has a desire to know what it takes to succeed as an entrepreneur in our nation. Why a book, video and podcast?Since the publication of Green Card Voices’ award-winning, first book “Green Card YOUTH Voices: Immigration Stories from a Minneapolis High School,” we have seen the value of having these stories accessible in a written format.

For our impact to be as broad as it can be, it is critical that we use all the types of mediums available.We want to expand our book + video project to include a podcast series as well. With a podcast, people can learn from these entrepreneurial experts on the go! The book, videos, and podcasts will inspire and educate other entrepreneurs as they embark on their own journeys!The project will include:
30 narratives written by immigrant entrepreneurs
Full page, color portraits of each immigrant
A link to the entrepreneur’s VIDEO interview on the GCV website
A link to the entrepreneur’s PODCAST interview
A highlighted quote from the personal essay

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Zašto smo pokrenuli Reaktor ideja i zašto ga tiskati?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Časopis je pokrenut zato što postoji mnogo informacija koje nam svakodnevno promiču. Studenti dobivaju pohvale; profesori započinju milijunske projekte;<br/>održavaju se zanimljiva predavanja i radionice.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Šteta je da, kada se nešto divno događa u našoj okolini, ne čujemo za to. Tek kada dobijemo informaciju, onda biramo načine kako raspolagati tom informacijom - hoćemo li se javiti i pokušati sudjelovati u nečemu ili ćemo dobiti inspiraciju za napraviti nešto vlastito.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Časopis je odličan način za organiziranje i širenje pozitivnih informacija.<br/><strong>Neka se vidi da se u Hrvatskoj događaju pozitivne stvari</strong>,<br/>a ne samo negativne koje se promoviraju putem nacionalnih medija.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Da ne bi i naš časopis bio jedna od onih informacija koja <i>samo promakne </i>u moru informacija, potrebno ga je tiskati i tako doprijeti do šire publike; tako tražiti potporu; tako promovirati kemijsko-inženjersku struku; tako tražiti još ljudi koji bi bili zainteresirani za pisanje i sudjelovanje u stvaranju časopisa.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Kakav je ovo časopis?</h3>
<p><a href=""https://www.hdki.hr/hdki/casopisi/reaktor_ideja"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Reaktor ideja</a> studentski je časopis kojim se promiče znanost, izvrsnost studenata i profesora, a promoviraju se i događaji vezani uz kemijsko-inženjersku struku i slične struke.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Što će nam 3000 $ omogućiti?</h3>
<p>Otkad je pokrenut časopis, cilj uredničkog tima je tiskanje časopisa i dopiranje do šire publike. Zbog toga smo se prijavili na:</p>
<ol>
<li>natječaj Studentskog zbora Sveučilišta u Zagrebu na kojem smo dobili 4395 kn.</li>
<li>natječaj Zaklade Adris, ali nažalost nismo prošli.</li>
<li>natječaj Hrvatskih voda, odgovor se čeka.</li>
</ol>
<p> 3000 $ (otprilike 20 000 kn) dostatno je za tiskanje 100 primjeraka časopisa u boji svaki mjesec, sljedećih 10 mjeseci tj. cijelu 2018. godinu. Trenutno je u postupku odlučivanje je li isplativije tiskati veći broj crno-bijelog časopisa (jeftinije verzije). O tome će svi donatori biti obaviješteni.</p>
<p>U slučaju da ne dobijemo zadovoljavajuća financijska sredstva postoje <strong>tri ishoda</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li> Časopis će se tiskati crno-bijelo s koricama u boji;</li>
<li>Morat ćemo uvesti pretplate i plaćanje časopisa (napominjemo da je časopis besplatan)</li>
<li>Nećemo moći tiskati časopis.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Ako dobijemo više, </strong>to će omogućiti</p>
<ol>
<li>Tiskanje većeg broja časopisa</li>
<li>Financiranje održavanja radionica Studentske sekcije i drugih projekata</li>
</ol>
<p>Dodatna financijska sredstva nastojat ćemo dobiti kroz druge natječaje i objavljivanje oglasa u časopisu. Za oglašavanje se možete javiti na inestop1012@gmail.com.</p>

<p>Reaktor ideja najveći je projekt <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/StudentskaSekcijaHDKI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Studentske sekcije Hrvatskog Društva Kemijskih Inženjera i tehnologa</a>.</p>
<p>Studentska sekcija osnovana je krajem 2016. godine, a počela je s radom u ožujku 2017. godine. Nadamo se da smo potaknuli pozitivne promjene na Fakultetu kemijskog inženjerstva i tehnologije jer to i jest naš cilj. Rado bismo utjecali i na nacionalnoj razini, ali nismo dovoljno jaki za to.</p>
<p>Ostvarili smo mnogobrojne uspješne projekte:</p>
<p><strong>Predavanja</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<i>Kako napisati projekt</i> (15.03.2017.) uz 45 prisutnih studenata. Na krilima ovog predavanja osvojili smo 8000 kn za 3 projekta (Reaktor ideja 4395, Međusmjerovske igre 3000 i Ciklus predavanja o 3D printanju 600 kn)</li>
<li>
<i>FKIT-ovci na razmjenama studenata</i> (24.04.2017.) uz prisutnih 77 studenata. Nadamo se da će ovo predavanje rezultirati povećanjem broja FKIT-ovaca koji idu na razmjene studenata.</li>
<li>
<i>Što nakon faksa? </i>(17.05.2017.) uz prisutnih 160 studenata. S ovog predavanja dobili smo znanja o tome što rade kemijski inženjeri i čuli smo vrijedna iskustva bivših FKIT-ovaca.</li>
<li>
<i>CIKLUS PREDAVANJA I RADIONICA 3D PRINTANJA </i>(21.11.2017. - 19.12.2017.). Ovo je projekt koji upravo počinje i interes za predavanja i radionice iskazalo je preko 250 studenata.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Stručne ekskurzije</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<i>Posjet tvornici Drava International d.o.o. </i>u Osijeku (11.05.2017.). Otprilike 25 članova Studentske sekcije putovalo je u Osijek uz potporu prof. dr. sc. Zlate Hrnjak-Murgić.</li>
<li>
<i>Posjet Nuklearnoj elektrani Krško </i>u Krško (12.10.2017.). 48 članova Studentske sekcije posjetilo je NEK uz sponzorstvo Elektrane. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Buddy projekt za brucoše</strong><br/>Od ove godine, po prvi put na FKIT-u, provodimo buddy projekt za mentorstvo brucošima. otprilike 50 starijih studenata uključeno je u projekt i svaki od njih dobio je 4-5 brucoša koje cijelu godinu treba savjetovati oko kolegija i davati im upute za razne nedoumice koje se javljaju na prvoj godini studija: ""Kako koristiti iksicu"", ""Kako prijaviti ispit"", ""Gdje je koja učionica"" itd.</p>
<p><strong>Međusmjerovske igre 2017.</strong><br/>Održali smo prvi sportski dan Fakulteta kemijskog inženjerstva i tehnologije 23.10. po lošem vremenu. Kiša nije onemogućila održavanje sportskih natjecanja s mnogobrojnim prisutnima i uz opće veselje. Prvih troje u svakom sportu, a igralo se 10 sportova, dobilo je medalje i druge sponzorske nagrade, a najbolji smjer (studij) osvojio je pehar. Ove je godine pobjednik bio KI.</p>
<p><strong>Radionice</strong><br/>Osim navedenih radionica o 3D printanju koje se održavaju od 21.11. do 19.12., pripremaju se još dvije radionice (radionica o Matlabu i radionica o EU projektima).</p>
<p><strong>Projekti promocije znanosti</strong><br/>U pripremi su tri različita projekta promocije znanosti.</p>
<p><strong>Djed Božićnjak na FKIT-u</strong><br/>Super tajni projekt u pripremi.</p>

<h2 align=""center""><strong>Reactor of Ideas – the initial motivation and what stands behind the desire of putting it in the press</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center"">Purpose of magazine <i>Reactor of Ideas </i>(Reaktor ideja), initiated and being run completely by students from <i><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/StudentskaSekcijaHDKI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Student Section of Croatian Society of Chemical Engineers</a>, </i>is to provide simple path to approach important information which people often overlook, or are not familiarized with them at all. We talk about secial prizes and acknowledgments, different lectures and workshops, and even new projects worth millions of dollars.</p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p align=""center"">We usually fail to observe and listen what is happening around us while in the same time we are forgetting that, in order to utilize the advantages of different information, firstly we have to be aware they exist. If we don’t know for a specific lecture, we cannot know if we want to attend it and moreover, we can miss a great opportunity to meet influential people and get the inspiration to create something of our own.</p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p align=""center"">A magazine is among the best ways for organizing and spreading useful information. Our goal is to do as much as possible to bring the positive news closer to the broad public and eventually overcome all the negative reports national media serves on a daily basis.</p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p align=""center"">We don’t want Reactor of Ideas to get lost in the myriad of everyday publications, we want it to make an impact, to be heard, and that is where putting it in press could make a difference. That way it would reach wider audience, attract new imaginative individuals for further growth and even better ideas, and, the most important, the success in the promotion and support of science would be inevitable.</p>
<h3 align=""center""> </h3>
<h3 align=""center""><strong>What kind of a magazine is this?</strong></h3>
<p align=""center""><a href=""https://www.hdki.hr/hdki/casopisi/reaktor_ideja"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Reaktor ideja</a> is a magazine written by students, but intended for everyone involved in science. It promotes science, excellence of students and professors, and events connected to chemical engineering and similar fields of science. It is written by students and professors of Faculty of chemical engineering and technology, University of Zagreb, Croatia and by students of related Faculties (PBF Zagreb, PMF Zagreb and KTF Split).</p>
<h3 align=""center""> </h3>
<h3 align=""center""><strong>A little more about this student magazine...</strong></h3>
<p>The magazine is divided into four parts. Each part has an editor in charge.</p>

<h2 align=""center""><strong>Readership</strong></h2>
<p align=""center"" style=""margin-left:18.0pt;"">This magazine is being published monthly on web pages of FKIT, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/StudentskaSekcijaHDKI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Student section of HDKI</a> and HDKI. 10 issues are planned every year.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:18.0pt;"">First number of the magazine was published 4<sup>th</sup> April and was read over 500 times.<br/>Second number was published 4<sup>th</sup> May and was read over 700 times.<br/>Third number was published 5<sup>th</sup> June and was read over 1100 times.<br/>Fourth number was published 6<sup>th</sup> July and was read over 1200 times.</p>
<p align=""center"" style=""margin-left:18.0pt;"">Reactor of ideas is read (besides in Croatia) in Australia, USA, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Lithuania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ireland, UK and also India.</p>
<p align=""center"" style=""margin-left:18.0pt;"">It is not a coincidence India made the list. Cooperation with Indian chemical engineering students was established and an article about them was written in the third issue of Reactor of ideas.</p>
<p align=""center"" style=""margin-left:18.0pt;""> </p>
<h2 align=""center""><strong>What will 3000 $ provide?</strong></h2>
<p align=""center"">From the beginning, editorial team’s goal was “throwing” it in the press to reach wider audience. Because of that, we applied Reactor of ideas project to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Student council of UNIZG Fund and got around 500 $</li>
<li>Adris Grup Fund and were unfortunately declined</li>
<li>Croatian waters Fund and we are waiting for the answer.</li>
</ol>
<p align=""center""><strong>3000 $ will be enough to provide</strong> 100 copies of the magazine every month for the next 10 months (the whole 2018.).</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>In case we don’t reach the goal</strong>, there are three possible outcomes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Magazine will be printed black and white</li>
<li>We will need to start charging for the magazine (magazine is free now!!)</li>
<li>We will not be able to print the magazine</li>
</ol>
<p align=""center""><strong>If we get more than 3000 $, </strong>it will enable us to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Print more magazines</li>
<li>Finance our workshops, lectures and other projects</li>
</ol>
<p align=""center"">We are continually trying to get additional funding through other sources, like through <strong>publishing advertisements</strong> in our magazine. For publishing advertisements, contact <a href=""mailto:inestop1012@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">inestop1012@gmail.com</a></p>
<h3 align=""center""><strong>Who are we and why support us?</strong></h3>
<p align=""center"">Reaktor ideja (Reactor of ideas) is the biggest project of <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/StudentskaSekcijaHDKI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Student section of Croatian society of chemical engineers</a>.</p>
<p align=""center"">Student section started with its work in March 2017. We hope that we initiated positive changes in the chemical engineering community because that is our goal. We would love to have a global impact, but we are not strong enough.</p>
<p align=""center"">We accomplished many successful projects:</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Lectures:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<i>How to write a project </i>(15<sup>th</sup> March 2017.) – lecture with 45 participants. On the wings of this lecture, we won around 1200 $ for three of our projects (Reactor of ideas, 1. Sport day of Faculty of chemical engineering and technology and Cycle of 3D printing lectures</li>
<li>
<i>Chemical engineering students on student exchange </i>(24<sup>th</sup> April 2017.) with 77 participants. We hope this lecture will result by increasing the number of students going on student exchange programmes.</li>
<li>
<i>What do chemical engineers do? </i>(17<sup>th</sup> May 2017.) with 160 students present. On this lecture, we heard experiences from 5 graduated chemical engineers</li>
<li>
<i>Cycle of lectures and workshops for 3D printing </i>(21<sup>st</sup> November 2017. – 19<sup>th</sup> December 2017) – these lectures will be posted on YouTube and you will be notified</li>
</ol>
<p align=""center""><strong>Buddy project for freshmen</strong><br/>This year, we started a buddy project for mentoring freshmen. Around 50 older students are buddies for 4-5 freshmen each. They are giving them advice on how to solve many obstacles that students have on their first year: “How to use student ID”, “How to apply for an exam”, etc.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>1<sup>st</sup> sport day of Faculty of chemical engineering and technology</strong><br/>This October, we held the first sport day of Faculty of chemical engineering and technology. It rained but that didn’t stop us. We moved the contest indoors and held every sport as planned. It was a new experience for us, but it went great.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Workshops</strong><br/>Beside from <i>Cycle of lectures and workshops for 3D printing</i>, we are preparing Matlab and EU project workshops.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Promotion of science projects</strong><br/>We are preparing three different projects to promote science in high schools.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Santa Claus on Faculty of chemical engineering and technology</strong><br/>This super-secret project is being prepared.</p>

Zašto smo pokrenuli Reaktor ideja i zašto ga tiskati?
Časopis je pokrenut zato što postoji mnogo informacija koje nam svakodnevno promiču. Studenti dobivaju pohvale; profesori započinju milijunske projekte;održavaju se zanimljiva predavanja i radionice.
Šteta je da, kada se nešto divno događa u našoj okolini, ne čujemo za to. Tek kada dobijemo informaciju, onda biramo načine kako raspolagati tom informacijom - hoćemo li se javiti i pokušati sudjelovati u nečemu ili ćemo dobiti inspiraciju za napraviti nešto vlastito.
Časopis je odličan način za organiziranje i širenje pozitivnih informacija.Neka se vidi da se u Hrvatskoj događaju pozitivne stvari,a ne samo negativne koje se promoviraju putem nacionalnih medija.
Da ne bi i naš časopis bio jedna od onih informacija koja samo promakne u moru informacija, potrebno ga je tiskati i tako doprijeti do šire publike; tako tražiti potporu; tako promovirati kemijsko-inženjersku struku; tako tražiti još ljudi koji bi bili zainteresirani za pisanje i sudjelovanje u stvaranju časopisa.
 
Kakav je ovo časopis?
Reaktor ideja studentski je časopis kojim se promiče znanost, izvrsnost studenata i profesora, a promoviraju se i događaji vezani uz kemijsko-inženjersku struku i slične struke. Pišu ga studenti Fakulteta kemijskog inženjerstva i tehnologije Sveučilišta u Zagrebu (FKIT), Prehrambeno-biotehnološkog fakulteta Sveučilišta u Zagrebu (PBF) i Prirodoslovno-matematičkog fakulteta Sveučilišta u Zagrebu (PMF), ali i Kemijsko-tehnološkog fakulteta (KTF) u Splitu kao i asistenti, profesori i umirovljeni profesori s navedenih fakulteta.
 
Malo više o časopisu...
Časopis se sastoji od četiri dijela. Svaki dio ima svog urednika.
 

Kemijska posla sadrže novosti s fakulteta iz tehničkog područja 

izvještaje s događaja značajnih za znanstvenike i inženjere poput ""Materijali u automobilskoj industriji"" (FSB) ili ""Dani vina na PBF-u"" (PBF)
priče studentima i profesorima poput ""Jednogodišnje iskustvo u zemlji izlazećeg sunca"" ili ""Izdavanje knjige  Uvod u nanotehnologiju"", 
izvještaje s konferencija poput ""Simpozij studenata kemičara"" (PMF) ili ""Hranom do zdravlja"" (PTF Osijek),
izvještaje sa stručnih putovanja na koje idu studenti poput ""Posjet Nuklearnoj elektrani Krško"",
pa i poneke motivacijske članke poput ""Kako se motivirati i uživati u studiranju""

Urednica Kemijskih posla je ujedno i glavna urednica časopisa, Ines Topalović.

Znanstvenik na jednostavan način prikazuje znanstvene teme kroz znanstveno-popularne članke. Studenti se prvi put susreću s nečim što će im jednog dana biti važno u znanstvenoj karijeri, a to je objavljivanje članaka.

Objašnjavaju se stvari za koje svi znaju, a rijetki znaju kako funkcioniraju u člancima poput ""Princip rada klima uređaja"" ili ""Katalizator u automobilima""
Donosi se pregled novosti iz svijeta znanosti i industrije člancima poput ""Slatki uspjeh biobaterija""
Objašnjavaju se fenomeni u prirodi kroz članke poput ""Mpemba efekt""
Donose se priče iz života znanstvenika u člancima poput ""Thomas Midgley - izumitelj olovnog benzina i freona""
Izlažu se teme za koje su studenti osvojili Rektorove nagrade u člancima poput ""Ilegalno pranje goriva"" ili ""Razvoj i optimizacija one-pot metode""

Urednik Znanstvenika je ujedno i predsjednik Studentske sekcije HDKI-ja, Stjepan Džalto

Boje inženjerstva donose teme iz sveučilišnog sporta.

Objavljuju se izvještaji sa sveučilišnih prvenstava iz svih sportova
Pišu se izvještaji o uspjesima na natjecanjima poput Tehnologijade člancima poput ""FKIT šesti put za redom pobjednik Tehnologijade""

Urednica Boja inženjerstva bila je do sada naša grafička urednica Barbara Farkaš, a trenutno tražimo novog sportskog urednika.


Stand-up kemičar je zabavni dio u kojem se mogu pronaći sadržaji za opuštanje:

Šale poput ""Koju pjesmu sluša polimer kad prekine s curom? - Pokidat ću lance sve"",
Osmosmjerke,
Križaljke,
Zabavne činjenice,
Nagradni zadaci i slično

Urednica Stand-up kemičara je Iva Pavičić
 
Čitanost
Časopis se do sada objavljivao isključivo u elektroničkom obliku jednom mjesečno na stranicama FKIT-a, na društvenim mrežama Studentske sekcije HDKI-ja te na stranici HDKI-ja. Planirano je izdavanje 10 brojeva časopisa po akademskoj godini (jednom mjesečno).
Prvi broj časopisa objavljen je 4. travnja i čitan je preko 500 puta.Drugi broj objavljen je 4. svibnja i čitan je preko 700 puta.Treći broj objavljen je 5. lipnja i čitan je preko 1100 puta.Četvrti broj objavljen je 6. studenog i do sada je čitan 1200 puta. 
Osim u Lijepoj našoj, Reaktor ideja se čita i u Australiji, SAD-u, Španjolskoj, Portugalu, Francuskoj, Njemačkoj, Češkoj, Nizozemskoj, Latviji, Bosni i Hercegovini, Irskoj, Ujedinjenom kraljevstvu pa čak i u dalekoj Indiji. U Indiji nije pročitan sasvim slučajno. Ostvarena je suradnja sa studentima kemijskog inženjerstva u Indiji i o njima je bio napisan članak u trećem broju Reaktora ideja.
 
Što će nam 3000 $ omogućiti?
Otkad je pokrenut časopis, cilj uredničkog tima je tiskanje časopisa i dopiranje do šire publike. Zbog toga smo se prijavili na:

natječaj Studentskog zbora Sveučilišta u Zagrebu na kojem smo dobili 4395 kn.
natječaj Zaklade Adris, ali nažalost nismo prošli.
natječaj Hrvatskih voda, odgovor se čeka.

 3000 $ (otprilike 20 000 kn) dostatno je za tiskanje 100 primjeraka časopisa u boji svaki mjesec, sljedećih 10 mjeseci tj. cijelu 2018. godinu. Trenutno je u postupku odlučivanje je li isplativije tiskati veći broj crno-bijelog časopisa (jeftinije verzije). O tome će svi donatori biti obaviješteni.
U slučaju da ne dobijemo zadovoljavajuća financijska sredstva postoje tri ishoda:

 Časopis će se tiskati crno-bijelo s koricama u boji;
Morat ćemo uvesti pretplate i plaćanje časopisa (napominjemo da je časopis besplatan)
Nećemo moći tiskati časopis.

Ako dobijemo više, to će omogućiti

Tiskanje većeg broja časopisa
Financiranje održavanja radionica Studentske sekcije i drugih projekata

Dodatna financijska sredstva nastojat ćemo dobiti kroz druge natječaje i objavljivanje oglasa u časopisu. Za oglašavanje se možete javiti na inestop1012@gmail.com.
 
Tko smo mi i zašto nas podržati?

Reaktor ideja najveći je projekt Studentske sekcije Hrvatskog Društva Kemijskih Inženjera i tehnologa.
Studentska sekcija osnovana je krajem 2016. godine, a počela je s radom u ožujku 2017. godine. Nadamo se da smo potaknuli pozitivne promjene na Fakultetu kemijskog inženjerstva i tehnologije jer to i jest naš cilj. Rado bismo utjecali i na nacionalnoj razini, ali nismo dovoljno jaki za to.
Ostvarili smo mnogobrojne uspješne projekte:
Predavanja


Kako napisati projekt (15.03.2017.) uz 45 prisutnih studenata. Na krilima ovog predavanja osvojili smo 8000 kn za 3 projekta (Reaktor ideja 4395, Međusmjerovske igre 3000 i Ciklus predavanja o 3D printanju 600 kn)

FKIT-ovci na razmjenama studenata (24.04.2017.) uz prisutnih 77 studenata. Nadamo se da će ovo predavanje rezultirati povećanjem broja FKIT-ovaca koji idu na razmjene studenata.

Što nakon faksa? (17.05.2017.) uz prisutnih 160 studenata. S ovog predavanja dobili smo znanja o tome što rade kemijski inženjeri i čuli smo vrijedna iskustva bivših FKIT-ovaca.

CIKLUS PREDAVANJA I RADIONICA 3D PRINTANJA (21.11.2017. - 19.12.2017.). Ovo je projekt koji upravo počinje i interes za predavanja i radionice iskazalo je preko 250 studenata.

Stručne ekskurzije


Posjet tvornici Drava International d.o.o. u Osijeku (11.05.2017.). Otprilike 25 članova Studentske sekcije putovalo je u Osijek uz potporu prof. dr. sc. Zlate Hrnjak-Murgić.

Posjet Nuklearnoj elektrani Krško u Krško (12.10.2017.). 48 članova Studentske sekcije posjetilo je NEK uz sponzorstvo Elektrane. 

Buddy projekt za brucošeOd ove godine, po prvi put na FKIT-u, provodimo buddy projekt za mentorstvo brucošima. otprilike 50 starijih studenata uključeno je u projekt i svaki od njih dobio je 4-5 brucoša koje cijelu godinu treba savjetovati oko kolegija i davati im upute za razne nedoumice koje se javljaju na prvoj godini studija: ""Kako koristiti iksicu"", ""Kako prijaviti ispit"", ""Gdje je koja učionica"" itd.
Međusmjerovske igre 2017.Održali smo prvi sportski dan Fakulteta kemijskog inženjerstva i tehnologije 23.10. po lošem vremenu. Kiša nije onemogućila održavanje sportskih natjecanja s mnogobrojnim prisutnima i uz opće veselje. Prvih troje u svakom sportu, a igralo se 10 sportova, dobilo je medalje i druge sponzorske nagrade, a najbolji smjer (studij) osvojio je pehar. Ove je godine pobjednik bio KI.
RadioniceOsim navedenih radionica o 3D printanju koje se održavaju od 21.11. do 19.12., pripremaju se još dvije radionice (radionica o Matlabu i radionica o EU projektima).
Projekti promocije znanostiU pripremi su tri različita projekta promocije znanosti.
Djed Božićnjak na FKIT-uSuper tajni projekt u pripremi.

Reactor of Ideas – the initial motivation and what stands behind the desire of putting it in the press
 
Purpose of magazine Reactor of Ideas (Reaktor ideja), initiated and being run completely by students from Student Section of Croatian Society of Chemical Engineers, is to provide simple path to approach important information which people often overlook, or are not familiarized with them at all. We talk about secial prizes and acknowledgments, different lectures and workshops, and even new projects worth millions of dollars.
 
We usually fail to observe and listen what is happening around us while in the same time we are forgetting that, in order to utilize the advantages of different information, firstly we have to be aware they exist. If we don’t know for a specific lecture, we cannot know if we want to attend it and moreover, we can miss a great opportunity to meet influential people and get the inspiration to create something of our own.
 
A magazine is among the best ways for organizing and spreading useful information. Our goal is to do as much as possible to bring the positive news closer to the broad public and eventually overcome all the negative reports national media serves on a daily basis.
 
We don’t want Reactor of Ideas to get lost in the myriad of everyday publications, we want it to make an impact, to be heard, and that is where putting it in press could make a difference. That way it would reach wider audience, attract new imaginative individuals for further growth and even better ideas, and, the most important, the success in the promotion and support of science would be inevitable.
 
What kind of a magazine is this?
Reaktor ideja is a magazine written by students, but intended for everyone involved in science. It promotes science, excellence of students and professors, and events connected to chemical engineering and similar fields of science. It is written by students and professors of Faculty of chemical engineering and technology, University of Zagreb, Croatia and by students of related Faculties (PBF Zagreb, PMF Zagreb and KTF Split).
 
A little more about this student magazine...
The magazine is divided into four parts. Each part has an editor in charge.

Kemijska posla (Chemical business) contains articles from faculties of technical studies

We bring reports from events important to scientists and engineers like “Materials in automobile industry” (FSB) or “The days of wine on PBF” (PBF)
It includes  inspiring stories from lives of students and professors like “One year experience in the Land of the rising sun” or “Publishing of the book Nanotechnology 1.01”
Here you can find reports from conferences like “Symposium of chemistry students” (PMF) or “With food to health” (PTF Osijek),
Reports from trips to Nuclear power plants, refineries etc.
And also motivation articles like “How to motivate yourself and enjoy studying”

Ines Topalović is the editor of Chemical business.

Znanstvenik (Scientist) presents scientific topics in a way everyone can understand through popular articles. Here, students meet with a concept very important for their careers – publishing scientific articles.

Here we explain the science behind things familiar to everyone in articles like “How does air conditioning work?” or “Catalyst in automobiles”
We bring news from science and industry in articles like “Sweet success of biobatteries”
We explain natural phenomena in articles like “Mpemba effect”
We bring stories from lives of scientists in articles like “Thomas Midgley – inventor of lead gasoline and freons”
We show scientific researches carried out by students in articles like “Illegal gasoline washing” and “Development and optimization of one-pot method”

Stjepan Džalto is the editor of Scientist.

Boje inženjerstva (Colors of engineering) bring university sport closer to people.

Reports of university championships are brought to you by Colors of engineering
Articles about competitions like Tehnologijada in articles like “FKIT, winner of Tehnologijada for the 6th time in a row”

Editor of Colors of engineering is Barbara Farkaš.

Stand-up kemičar (Stand-up chemist) is the part for relaxation where you can find content like

Jokes like “What is the chemical version of the song from the movie Lion king? – HCOONa matata”
Cross-word puzzles
Fun facts
Reward assignments

Editor of Stand-up chemist is Iva Pavičić
 
Readership
This magazine is being published monthly on web pages of FKIT, Student section of HDKI and HDKI. 10 issues are planned every year.
First number of the magazine was published 4th April and was read over 500 times.Second number was published 4th May and was read over 700 times.Third number was published 5th June and was read over 1100 times.Fourth number was published 6th July and was read over 1200 times.
Reactor of ideas is read (besides in Croatia) in Australia, USA, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Lithuania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ireland, UK and also India.
It is not a coincidence India made the list. Cooperation with Indian chemical engineering students was established and an article about them was written in the third issue of Reactor of ideas.
 
What will 3000 $ provide?
From the beginning, editorial team’s goal was “throwing” it in the press to reach wider audience. Because of that, we applied Reactor of ideas project to:

Student council of UNIZG Fund and got around 500 $
Adris Grup Fund and were unfortunately declined
Croatian waters Fund and we are waiting for the answer.

3000 $ will be enough to provide 100 copies of the magazine every month for the next 10 months (the whole 2018.).
In case we don’t reach the goal, there are three possible outcomes:

Magazine will be printed black and white
We will need to start charging for the magazine (magazine is free now!!)
We will not be able to print the magazine

If we get more than 3000 $, it will enable us to:

Print more magazines
Finance our workshops, lectures and other projects

We are continually trying to get additional funding through other sources, like through publishing advertisements in our magazine. For publishing advertisements, contact inestop1012@gmail.com
Who are we and why support us?
Reaktor ideja (Reactor of ideas) is the biggest project of Student section of Croatian society of chemical engineers.
Student section started with its work in March 2017. We hope that we initiated positive changes in the chemical engineering community because that is our goal. We would love to have a global impact, but we are not strong enough.
We accomplished many successful projects:
Lectures:


How to write a project (15th March 2017.) – lecture with 45 participants. On the wings of this lecture, we won around 1200 $ for three of our projects (Reactor of ideas, 1. Sport day of Faculty of chemical engineering and technology and Cycle of 3D printing lectures

Chemical engineering students on student exchange (24th April 2017.) with 77 participants. We hope this lecture will result by increasing the number of students going on student exchange programmes.

What do chemical engineers do? (17th May 2017.) with 160 students present. On this lecture, we heard experiences from 5 graduated chemical engineers

Cycle of lectures and workshops for 3D printing (21st November 2017. – 19th December 2017) – these lectures will be posted on YouTube and you will be notified

Buddy project for freshmenThis year, we started a buddy project for mentoring freshmen. Around 50 older students are buddies for 4-5 freshmen each. They are giving them advice on how to solve many obstacles that students have on their first year: “How to use student ID”, “How to apply for an exam”, etc.
1st sport day of Faculty of chemical engineering and technologyThis October, we held the first sport day of Faculty of chemical engineering and technology. It rained but that didn’t stop us. We moved the contest indoors and held every sport as planned. It was a new experience for us, but it went great.
WorkshopsBeside from Cycle of lectures and workshops for 3D printing, we are preparing Matlab and EU project workshops.
Promotion of science projectsWe are preparing three different projects to promote science in high schools.
Santa Claus on Faculty of chemical engineering and technologyThis super-secret project is being prepared.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Kids watch adults make financial decisions every day, whether it’s paying for gas, shopping, or going out to eat. Financial experts agree that talking to kids about money can help them make better financial decisions as they grow up and that these conversations should start early and happen often.</p>
<p>As a financial professional, I know how difficult it can be to talk about money and just how important it is for kids to become money smart. But I couldn’t find a kid-friendly tool for parents and teachers to use.</p>
<p>So I created Liktoon's Boat, an illustrated children's book. Liktoon’s Boat is not only a magical adventure filled with colorful illustrations – it’s also a fun introduction to concepts like earning and saving money for a goal.</p>
<p>Liktoon's boat, uses bright colors, and familiar topics like stories, toys, and friendships to provide introduction to basic mathematical and financial concepts. In addition to helping children with their reading skills, this book introduces the important topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addition and subtraction</li>
<li>Earnings and savings</li>
<li>Delayed gratification, perseverance and teamwork</li>
<li>Business principles such as entrepreneurship, profits and expenses</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important to teach our kids to be money savvy, especially during their foundational years so that they can grow into financially responsible adults. </p>

<p>Abhijit and I see ""Liktoon's boat"" as just the beginning. We've created a digital home for Liktoon &amp; friends (Liktoon.com). Through Liktoon's future adventures on his boat, we would like to continue to introduce children more money related concepts. </p>
<p>Here are some illustrations from the book:</p>

<p>Currently we are at a stage where the illustrations are almost done and we are finishing the design of the book. We are also sharing profits from this campaign with not-for-profit organizations that help promote financial literacy. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Please place your order today! In order to complete Liktoon's boat and print the books affordably, it's important to order in bulk. We need to sell at least 500 copies in order to get the books printed affordably and get them to you. </p>
<p>Your money will go towards making this book a high quality product for your child:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completion of illustrations and copy-editing</li>
<li>Book design for print and e-book formats</li>
<li>Book publishing, printing and marketing</li>
<li>Profits will be shared with organizations that promote financial literacy</li>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Kids watch adults make financial decisions every day, whether it’s paying for gas, shopping, or going out to eat. Financial experts agree that talking to kids about money can help them make better financial decisions as they grow up and that these conversations should start early and happen often.
As a financial professional, I know how difficult it can be to talk about money and just how important it is for kids to become money smart. But I couldn’t find a kid-friendly tool for parents and teachers to use.
So I created Liktoon's Boat, an illustrated children's book. Liktoon’s Boat is not only a magical adventure filled with colorful illustrations – it’s also a fun introduction to concepts like earning and saving money for a goal.
Liktoon's boat, uses bright colors, and familiar topics like stories, toys, and friendships to provide introduction to basic mathematical and financial concepts. In addition to helping children with their reading skills, this book introduces the important topics such as:

Addition and subtraction
Earnings and savings
Delayed gratification, perseverance and teamwork
Business principles such as entrepreneurship, profits and expenses

It's important to teach our kids to be money savvy, especially during their foundational years so that they can grow into financially responsible adults. 

Abhijit and I see ""Liktoon's boat"" as just the beginning. We've created a digital home for Liktoon & friends (Liktoon.com). Through Liktoon's future adventures on his boat, we would like to continue to introduce children more money related concepts. 
Here are some illustrations from the book:

Currently we are at a stage where the illustrations are almost done and we are finishing the design of the book. We are also sharing profits from this campaign with not-for-profit organizations that help promote financial literacy. 

What We Need
Please place your order today! In order to complete Liktoon's boat and print the books affordably, it's important to order in bulk. We need to sell at least 500 copies in order to get the books printed affordably and get them to you. 
Your money will go towards making this book a high quality product for your child:

Completion of illustrations and copy-editing
Book design for print and e-book formats
Book publishing, printing and marketing
Profits will be shared with organizations that promote financial literacy

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When someone says “sarma” , “vanilice”, “baklava”, “pogača”, “zeljanica”, “pihtije”... in Serbia, it immediately refreshes one's memories and the relation with tradition. The tradition of Serbian cuisine is very old. One of the oldest Serbian cookbook was Srbski kuvar by Krusedol Monastery monk Jerotej Draganovic, published in 1865, in the Old Slavic language. One of the most educated people living at the end of 19<sup>th</sup> and the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Sima Trojanovic (who was ethnologist),  published a book called Old Serbian Dishes and Beverages in 1896.</p>
<p>The list of such old collections of recipes, cookbooks, books on customs is very long. These books represent our primary motivation and driving force to start and finish this project underlain by the following idea: to preserve a part of the culinary and cultural heritage that came from our ancestors. In this book, you will find many old dishes which are now on the verge of being forgotten, which can be very rarely ordered in restaurants and are seldom prepared even within the family circles.</p>
<p>This project is recognized and supported by Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia, as very important step in order to preserve a part of the culinary and cultural heritage:</p>
<p><i>„A traditional recipe of the local Serbian cuisine is an important part of the intangible cultural heritage of each nation. The list of elements of the intangible cultural heritage of the Republic of Serbia, in addition to traditional crafts, folk tradition, ethno songs and dances, with naive painting Slovaks, there are Belmuz meal, traditional production of Pirot cheese, pazarske mantije meal (traditional method of preparation). These elements are vital to the preservation of national identity, and are also an integral part of various tourism offers.</i></p>

<p>We’re at a time like no other in British history; we’re on the edge of the precipice trying to work out what Brexit will bring, while the world wonders if globalisation has failed. We need to capture that unique moment and celebrate those engaging in politics to make the world work. We want to play a role in defining our age, by producing a magazine that also looks at where we’re heading.</p>
<p><strong>Meet Stand Up:</strong></p>
<p>Stand Up is a print magazine dedicated to giving young people a voice in political debate.  Increasing pressures on young people, such as the rising costs of education and housing, mean our voices should be heard now more than ever. While Brexit was a wake-up call, and a trigger for inspiring Trump's victory in the US, it's so important to remember that young people largely voted to remain within the EU - and many more were denied the right to vote at all, due to their age.</p>
<p>Stand Up will encapsulate the spirit of our young voices. The magazine is driven by young journalists spurred into action when, already stung by Brexit, we watched the election of President Trump. When hope seemed futile, this team started applying our talents to see what we could do to empower other young people.</p>
<p>While the magazine’s core journalism focuses on political analysis, it also tells cultural stories to amplify the voices of young people. Stand Up is in solidarity with migrants, people of colour, LGBTQ+ people, women and disabled people, and their stories will be included throughout. The magazine will also make sure that no one in the UK is forgotten. Too often the media focuses upon London or other major cities, and so Stand Up will connect with every corner of the UK.</p>
<p><strong>Why Now?</strong></p>
<p>The magazine will be launched one year on since Brexit. The referendum saw a rise of hate crime across the nation, and deep divides appearing in families. Stand Up will examine what drove us to this point as well as looking ahead, to see how young people really can make a difference.</p>
<p>The magazine was created with the singular aim: to inspire young people. Political apathy is understandable in a climate of fear. Many simply switch off, feeling hopeless, but Stand Up will highlight how people across the UK are making a difference and standing up to oppression. Stand Up will also show people how they can get involved in activism and politics (and promote accessible practices). In uncertain times, it is important not to lose momentum and to continue fighting to protect human rights, and all of our futures.</p>
<p><strong>What we will do with your money</strong></p>
<p>Donations will be used to cover the cost of printing. Stand Up will be ethically made with recyclable paper. Simply put, the more money we raise the more people can read our magazine.</p>
<p><strong>Print vs Digital</strong></p>
<p>When our fundraising donations are directly going towards printing it’s more than fair to ask why we chose print over digital. Digital magazines are incredibly popular but print has maintained its prominence in the market. People still want to hold a magazine in their hands. Magazines are inherently aspirational and we want people to walk away with a solid product that will stay with them for a long time.</p>
<p>Our magazine will be a substantial product: 72 pages on matte paper. It isn’t something we want to be just discarded with recycling (although if ever you do dispose of it, be environmentally friendly!) but something readers can keep coming back to. Print will produce the fitting product for our brand, and for our goals - but we need support to make it happen.</p>
<p><br/><strong>What Stand Up will include</strong></p>
<p>Stand Up will cover politics, culture, people and power. Brexit will feature throughout, and we’re interested in taking a nuanced and analytical approach. We'll look at whether there can be a positive outcome for the UK, what the Brexit crisis means for our democracy and constitution and, most importantly, how it’s going to impact young people.</p>
<p>We’re not interested in an insular approach. We’re going to be looking at how other countries are responding to Brexit, with features that celebrate activists from around the world.  </p>
<p>There’s also going to be a wide range of content on the experiences of marginalised people. Too often people are shut out of debate, but we’re clear: we want to empower young people to make their voices heard and that absolutely has to include marginalised young people. Contrary to mainstream beliefs, we feel that it was ignoring marginalised communities in the first place that caused the deep divides in society. Diversity isn’t a chore. We can only have thorough journalism when all communities are spoken to and engaged with.</p>
<p>There will be lighter content too, looking at ‘the millennial lifestyle’ and our media. We’ve experienced a rapid boom in digital products during our lives and they deserve as much reflection as the political changes.</p>

</div></div>","We’re at a time like no other in British history; we’re on the edge of the precipice trying to work out what Brexit will bring, while the world wonders if globalisation has failed. We need to capture that unique moment and celebrate those engaging in politics to make the world work. We want to play a role in defining our age, by producing a magazine that also looks at where we’re heading.
Meet Stand Up:
Stand Up is a print magazine dedicated to giving young people a voice in political debate.  Increasing pressures on young people, such as the rising costs of education and housing, mean our voices should be heard now more than ever. While Brexit was a wake-up call, and a trigger for inspiring Trump's victory in the US, it's so important to remember that young people largely voted to remain within the EU - and many more were denied the right to vote at all, due to their age.
Stand Up will encapsulate the spirit of our young voices. The magazine is driven by young journalists spurred into action when, already stung by Brexit, we watched the election of President Trump. When hope seemed futile, this team started applying our talents to see what we could do to empower other young people.
While the magazine’s core journalism focuses on political analysis, it also tells cultural stories to amplify the voices of young people. Stand Up is in solidarity with migrants, people of colour, LGBTQ+ people, women and disabled people, and their stories will be included throughout. The magazine will also make sure that no one in the UK is forgotten. Too often the media focuses upon London or other major cities, and so Stand Up will connect with every corner of the UK.
Why Now?
The magazine will be launched one year on since Brexit. The referendum saw a rise of hate crime across the nation, and deep divides appearing in families. Stand Up will examine what drove us to this point as well as looking ahead, to see how young people really can make a difference.
The magazine was created with the singular aim: to inspire young people. Political apathy is understandable in a climate of fear. Many simply switch off, feeling hopeless, but Stand Up will highlight how people across the UK are making a difference and standing up to oppression. Stand Up will also show people how they can get involved in activism and politics (and promote accessible practices). In uncertain times, it is important not to lose momentum and to continue fighting to protect human rights, and all of our futures.
What we will do with your money
Donations will be used to cover the cost of printing. Stand Up will be ethically made with recyclable paper. Simply put, the more money we raise the more people can read our magazine.
Print vs Digital
When our fundraising donations are directly going towards printing it’s more than fair to ask why we chose print over digital. Digital magazines are incredibly popular but print has maintained its prominence in the market. People still want to hold a magazine in their hands. Magazines are inherently aspirational and we want people to walk away with a solid product that will stay with them for a long time.
Our magazine will be a substantial product: 72 pages on matte paper. It isn’t something we want to be just discarded with recycling (although if ever you do dispose of it, be environmentally friendly!) but something readers can keep coming back to. Print will produce the fitting product for our brand, and for our goals - but we need support to make it happen.
What Stand Up will include
Stand Up will cover politics, culture, people and power. Brexit will feature throughout, and we’re interested in taking a nuanced and analytical approach. We'll look at whether there can be a positive outcome for the UK, what the Brexit crisis means for our democracy and constitution and, most importantly, how it’s going to impact young people.
We’re not interested in an insular approach. We’re going to be looking at how other countries are responding to Brexit, with features that celebrate activists from around the world.  
There’s also going to be a wide range of content on the experiences of marginalised people. Too often people are shut out of debate, but we’re clear: we want to empower young people to make their voices heard and that absolutely has to include marginalised young people. Contrary to mainstream beliefs, we feel that it was ignoring marginalised communities in the first place that caused the deep divides in society. Diversity isn’t a chore. We can only have thorough journalism when all communities are spoken to and engaged with.
There will be lighter content too, looking at ‘the millennial lifestyle’ and our media. We’ve experienced a rapid boom in digital products during our lives and they deserve as much reflection as the political changes.

<p>After the first of the year I started to really dive deep in the writing and was writing 5 hours a day every day for nearly a month. I started school again and had to stop writing so obsessively, it hurt to stop something so beautiful.

<h3>Help Spread the Truth about the Elite's Global Pedophilia Network</h3>
<p>Nearly everyone holds a special place in their heart for the most vulnerable amongst us - our children. Protecting them from harm is our moral and legal responsibility, duty and obligation as parents, as a society and as a human species. But for us to keep our innocents safe, alive and healthy, we must become aware of any clear and present danger known to cause irreparable harm to defenseless children. And that danger is the corrosive, decaying political economic system led largely by psychopathic pedophiles that systematically control their puppet minions through rampant, unchecked blackmail and bribery. Using their diabolical sex trafficking network, they sexually exploit and sacrifice children as their pure evil means of corrupting and controlling compromised politicians, generals, judges, police chiefs, CEOs and entertainers to do their dirty bidding. In recent decades this Luciferian system has increasingly flourished, unbeknownst to the vast majority of the public.</p>
<p>Last fall's Pizzagate turned PedoGate began opening people's eyes to what's been systemically occurring all along for many years now. It's imperative that we learn the horrific truth behind this worldwide scourge if we're ever going to reduce and eliminate it.</p>
<p>As a West Point graduate and former Army officer, I once would have given my life in service to my country I grew up loving. But the cold hard reality is our nation has been hijacked by a handful of perverted, demonic psychopaths with an unquenchable addiction for sodomizing and cannibalizing children.</p>
<p>For over a quarter century I worked with at-risk youth in Los Angeles as a licensed Marriage Family therapist. Most of my clients were wards of the state in the foster care and juvenile probation system, many were pedophile victims. Frequently I clashed with a broken Child Protective Services system that failed to keep children safe. I'm grateful for the opportunity to help heal the emotional trauma of my sexually abused clients. They taught me the power of resilience and the strength of the human spirit while my care, support and belief in them created a foundation to start believing in themselves. Both my passion and compassion as a mental health professional served me well as a practitioner of the healing arts.</p>
<p>Shortly after 9/11 I realized if a handful of treasonous Washington insiders with help from Israel and Saudi Arabia could willfully murder in cold blood almost 3,000 fellow American citizens, in their genocidal crosshairs we are all expendable. The international crime cabal government responsible for manufacturing a perpetual state of war using US Empire created terrorists also orchestrated the current refugee crises in order to make obscene Big Business profits selling illegal drugs, arms, human organs and children while laundering trillions of ill-begotten dollars. </p>
<p>Several years ago I began utilizing my experience as a clinical therapist as well as my military background to write about the geopolitics of engineered wars and controlled crises as an elite agenda designed to facilitate global destabilization and chaos leading to one world government tyranny of the New World Order. In recent years as an independent investigative journalist, I've written hundreds of articles for such alternative news outlets as Global Research, Lew Rockwell and sott.net.  </p>
<p>A year ago I began writing about Pizzagate when few journalists even in alt news dared broach the subject. After over a half dozen articles on the emerging PedoGate scandal, at the behest of Jim Fetzer and Robert David Steele independently approaching me to request I write a book on pedophilia, I decided to create the A-Z encyclopedia on modern pedophilia, leaving no stone unturned. Recognizing that the rampant pedophilia epidemic is the elite's Achilles heel, I'm determined to fully expose the powerful sickos as our best opportunity to bring down their crime cabal. I've already completed the first half of <i>Pedophilia &amp; Empire: Satan, Sodomy and the Deep State</i>. The first eleven chapters are available for free on either my blog site at empireexposed.blogspot,com or phibetaiota.net (<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/pedoempire"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/pedoempire</a>)</p>
<p>With your help, I can finish this project much sooner than later and together we can move towards bringing justice for the multitudes of child victims (past and present) that urgently need our rescue, support and protection. Sealed indictments of some of these pedophile criminals are about to be released to the public. It appears that we're finally turning the corner on the prevailing culture of sexual predators always living above the law with total impunity. Truth and Reconciliation Commissions will permit low level cabal players to identify and provide the necessary evidence to hold the predators at the top of this pedo food chain fully accountable.</p>
<p>My research has connected all the major government and institutions from global religions to local Child ""Protective"" Services; the absolute worst thing I have learned is that the average life expectancy of a child kidnapped or sold into these pedophilia-Satanic ritual channels is only two years. I have also connected CIA's mind-control technologies to the elite and how they subversively control both their immediate subordinates, their slaves, and the public at large. We're all being screwed by the 1%, and this book uses pedophilia as a foundation for opening the  public's eyes to the depth and breadth of elite atrocities against us 99%. It will arm the individual with truth that empowers activism, solidarity and change.</p>

In recent years as an independent investigative journalist, I've written hundreds of articles for such alternative news outlets as Global Research, Lew Rockwell and sott.net.  
A year ago I began writing about Pizzagate when few journalists even in alt news dared broach the subject. After over a half dozen articles on the emerging PedoGate scandal, at the behest of Jim Fetzer and Robert David Steele independently approaching me to request I write a book on pedophilia, I decided to create the A-Z encyclopedia on modern pedophilia, leaving no stone unturned. Recognizing that the rampant pedophilia epidemic is the elite's Achilles heel, I'm determined to fully expose the powerful sickos as our best opportunity to bring down their crime cabal. I've already completed the first half of Pedophilia & Empire: Satan, Sodomy and the Deep State. The first eleven chapters are available for free on either my blog site at empireexposed.blogspot,com or phibetaiota.net (http://tinyurl.com/pedoempire)
With your help, I can finish this project much sooner than later and together we can move towards bringing justice for the multitudes of child victims (past and present) that urgently need our rescue, support and protection. Sealed indictments of some of these pedophile criminals are about to be released to the public. It appears that we're finally turning the corner on the prevailing culture of sexual predators always living above the law with total impunity. Truth and Reconciliation Commissions will permit low level cabal players to identify and provide the necessary evidence to hold the predators at the top of this pedo food chain fully accountable.
My research has connected all the major government and institutions from global religions to local Child ""Protective"" Services; the absolute worst thing I have learned is that the average life expectancy of a child kidnapped or sold into these pedophilia-Satanic ritual channels is only two years. I have also connected CIA's mind-control technologies to the elite and how they subversively control both their immediate subordinates, their slaves, and the public at large. We're all being screwed by the 1%, and this book uses pedophilia as a foundation for opening the  public's eyes to the depth and breadth of elite atrocities against us 99%. It will arm the individual with truth that empowers activism, solidarity and change.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We need your help to publish this important book.</p>
<p>This is the book we wish our own moms and dads stumbled upon while we were growing up. This book is the SEED that WE get to water for our Brown Girls- in the present and of the future.</p>
<p>In the present day, brown girls are experiencing significant pressure from the world regarding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self worth</li>
<li>Self love (Physical appearance and mental well-being)</li>
<li>Secure and healthy relationships with family and friends</li>
</ul>
<p>An idea was formed after the publishing of my first book, Brown Boy. I could not leave out the bold message that needed to be told about the brown girl.</p>
<p>A dear friend and parent of a brown girl expressed how her daughter seemed to not be so happy with her big, unruly, hair. I can only imagine the thoughts going through a child’s mind, but even more, what does a parent do to be sure that she loves herself regardless of her circumstances?</p>
<p>Brown Girl is an empowering children's book written for the girl that feels too tall, too small, not smart enough or creative enough. Little Makenzie is a fun loving brown girl with a beautiful spirit of boldness! Contrary to the wonderful things others say of her, Makenzie does not always love the way that she looks. In this book, Makenzie is challenged to understand the importance of self-love with the help of her father &amp; a few notable role models who also felt the same way once upon a time!</p>
<p>We are raising <strong>$3,000</strong> to produce and distribute a <strong>40 page illustrated story</strong> along with important <strong>educational curriculum based and community resource pages</strong> that reinforce self-worth and love to brown girls through positive affirmations!</p>
<p><strong>Everyone who donates $100 from February 1- April 1 </strong>will have their <strong>name listed</strong> on a special <strong>donor page of the book. </strong>(Your gift may also be recognized anonymously if you prefer).</p>
<p>Our hope is that this story will plant the seed of pride and encourage families to continue the conversation needed to build a strong generation.</p>
<p><strong>Please help make a difference in the lives of children who need it most. You have an opportunity to inspire young people of color to realize that despite their circumstances or feelings of lack, they are so much more! </strong>With your help, we will be able to get this book out into the world! Imagine how it could be if from a very early age, you knew everything you needed to know to live an amazing life, no matter what the circumstances were. What an amazing world we could create. Every contribution will help us reach our goal! We are also accepting pledges from those who may not want to purchase a book, but still want to support our efforts. If you are not able to support this vision financially but you still believe in its message, you can still help by spreading the word on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social media outlets.</p>

<h3>About Disquiet</h3>
<p>In mid 2016 I shared my story of mental illness on the internet. It took me two years feel ready to share it but only a few hours to write it. I didn’t overthink putting it out there, it felt like the natural way to make sense of things. Shortly after I published it, I began receiving messages from friends and colleagues. Each message was the same, they had experienced something similar.</p>
<p>My network is small, the number of people who read the story was probably only in the hundreds. Yet, within this small circle was an overwhelming amount of people who had experienced similar feelings. I had seen plenty of statistics on mental health, all pointing towards a growing concern. Yet it took these personal messages for the enormity of the problem become truly apparent to me.</p>
<p>Of those aforementioned statistics, there are two that strike me most. For men aged 20–49 in the UK, suicide is the number one cause of death.* In the UK men are three times more likely to die by suicide than women.* An extraordinary imbalance, especially considering that women are almost twice as likely to be diagnosed with anxiety disorders.†</p>
<p>So what gives? An outdated model of masculinity, the archaic mould men feel they need to fit, the all too damaging phrase “man up”, just a few things that lead to an inability for men to talk about these matters. Silence is what’s killing today’s men. Change is happening, stigmas are being broken, and here within these pages are perfect examples of that, some men, average men like you and I, speaking honestly and openly of their internal disquiet.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a life-long amateur scientist with a particular focus on astronomy. I have been researching the orientations of the ""antas"" of South-central Portugal for almost 20 years, and have concluded that they were built originally to be oriented to specific stars that were culturally important to the builders. But science has not been used to determine their construction dates, which are probably in the range of 7000 years ago. I want to try a scientific method to measure the date when the structures were constructed. Current estimates are based on the estimated age of objects found in the structures, but it is also clear that these structures were re-used over thousands of years. If the actual construction date can even be approximated using optically stimulated luminescence dating, a great deal can be learned about these structures and their purpose for the people who built them. There are several hundred such sites in South-central Portugal in various stages of deterioration, but many can be dated by this method.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

I am a life-long amateur scientist with a particular focus on astronomy. I have been researching the orientations of the ""antas"" of South-central Portugal for almost 20 years, and have concluded that they were built originally to be oriented to specific stars that were culturally important to the builders. But science has not been used to determine their construction dates, which are probably in the range of 7000 years ago. I want to try a scientific method to measure the date when the structures were constructed. Current estimates are based on the estimated age of objects found in the structures, but it is also clear that these structures were re-used over thousands of years. If the actual construction date can even be approximated using optically stimulated luminescence dating, a great deal can be learned about these structures and their purpose for the people who built them. There are several hundred such sites in South-central Portugal in various stages of deterioration, but many can be dated by this method.

<p>This African proverb encapsulates one of the major drivers for Blue Banyan Books because stories not only define your past, they can influence your present, and shape your understanding of the world.  We want to energize Caribbean publishing, creating international bestsellers, especially from writers and illustrators living in the Caribbean, rather than waiting on the major publishing houses to notice our writers once they have left home. Most importantly, we’re here to tell our stories in engaging and captivating ways.</p>
<p>In our short history, Blue Banyan Books has focused on fiction for children creating picture books about fun and adventure, and, of course, giving children cause to celebrate who they are. Under our imprint Blouse &amp; Skirt Books we’ve published nine award-winning YA novels in numerous genres including Caribbean fantasy, historical drama, mystery and romance.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597689165/ahhhpiositjdfjk5tq0q.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>But we want to do much more. For us, books are about more than putting our children in the picture – it’s about showing them the possibilities of what they can be, about opening up their world, a task even more important today when the world seems to be closing in. When naming the company, we chose the banyan tree because of its aerial roots, which we think is a great metaphor for our drive to remain rooted, no matter how much we grow.</p>
<p>Now for the first time, we’re trying to branch out into non-fiction for children, starting with a series of graphic (novel) biographies of great Jamaicans for children 8 to 12-years-old, the first two of which will be published in June 2021.  </p>
<p>Jamaica has produced many great people who’ve helped to shape the world today. People who knew that just because you come from a tiny island, a dot on the map, doesn’t mean we cannot change the world. Our national pledge indicates that it is our duty as Jamaicans to not only improve our country, but to “play our part in improving the welfare of the whole human race”. But long before our pledge was written, our country has punched well above its weight.</p>
<p>Yet many of our children, and many children across the world, don’t know enough about them. We want to change that.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597689532/fvfid1ggurlepbcyphtw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>To start off the series, we will be developing the two biographies: <strong><i>My Name is Mary</i></strong> - the life of Mary Seacole and <strong><i>My Name is Marcus -</i></strong> the life of Marcus Garvey. We chose these two because both were fearless, were entrepreneurs and had global impact.</p>
<p>It seems really fitting, that as the world grapples with a global pandemic, that we should bring even greater focus to Mary Seacole who was born Mary Joan Grant in Kingston, Jamaica in 1805, and began treating the sick as young as age 12. Herself a victim of Cholera, Seacole attended to the sick in Jamaica, in Panama, where and, of course, the Crimean War.</p>
<p>And what better time than now, should we shift children’s gaze to the life, works and words of Marcus Garvey. Born in St. Ann’s Bay, August 17, 1887, Garvey helped to shape the modern civil rights movement, promoting ideas of social resilience and racial equality, despite numerous obstacles. A formidable public speaker, Garvey inspired black people to be proud of their race. Need we say more than “Emancipate yourself from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our minds.”</p>
<p>And we’re putting together a great team of writers, researchers and illustrators to tell these stories. Celebrated poet and novelist Geoffrey Philp has already begun to pen the script for My Name is Marcus. A staunch advocate of Garvey, Philp’s published works include Uncle Obadiah and the Alien (1997) Benjamin, My Son (2003), Garvey’s Ghost. He’s the winner of Canute Brodhurst Prize and the James Michener Fellowship. To bring the words to dynamic life, we will be pulling on the efforts of one of the most exciting illustration talents in Kingston today, Djet Layne.</p>
<p>My Name is Mary will be authored by me, based on the fantastic research skills of life-long librarian Winsome Hudson, former National Librarian of Jamaica. My own writing has previously appeared in Pumpkin Belly and Other Stories, a collection of stories for children. Seacole’s life and travels will be illustrated by Staysean Daley, herself and illustrator, designer and entrepreneur.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are existing books featuring both Mary Seacole and Marcus Garvey, and interestingly, they both told their own stories. But most of these books have not come from our region. We think this matters. For us, it is important that we play a part in how our narrative is shaped. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Blue Banyan is committed to publishing these two graphic novels. We also know that it is a long time between now, when we’re raising the funds, and our expected publication date. But it is especially because we understand the demands of publishing and the need for illustrators and the designers to have enough time, that we have this projected timeline. With almost 30 publications under our portfolio, we know what it takes to get a book from idea right through to a beautiful work for your bookshelf.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if we do not make our target goal, it may take us longer to get to publication, but we will get there eventually. We’ve also made sure to budget in the cost of mailing books and other rewards to you our backers.</p>

Sie glaubt an den Erfolg des Projekts und wird nie müde, die Dinge voranzutreiben.Julia kreierte in einem Brainstorming gemeinsam mit ihrer guten Freundin und Künstlerkollegin Kristina Schippling, die bei „Magic Berlin“ unter anderem als Schauspielerin und Beraterin tätig ist, die Idee des transmedialen, also medienübergreifenden Webprojekts.Neben der Leitung und der kontinuierlichen Bearbeitung von Inhalten übernimmt Julia in „Magic Berlin“ die Rolle der Protagonistin – „Lucia Schadland“ – und erfüllt sich mit dem Schauspielern einen Kindheitstraum.Darüber hinaus hat sie große Freude daran, sich auf vielen Ebenen kunstvoll auszudrücken, z.B. tanzt und singt sie argentinischen Tango und liebt es zu zeichnen.  Sie ist als Mondprinzessin „Lia Hell“ Sängerin der Berliner Electropop-Band CLASH CLASH BANG BANG.

The Story
The story of ‘Magic Berlin’ is a true reflection of fiction imitating life with a delightful touch of magic realism.Lucia, the protagonist, is a girl like so many others. At the age of 27, she flees to Berlin to find herself and start a new chapter of her life in the vibrant German capital – only to become more thrilled, intoxicated and seduced by Berlin than she ever thought she would be.While many people come to Berlin to start over, Lucia’s story goes far beyond that common experience. She finds a magical past, as she meets unusual people from the Berlin pagan and magic scene, and she dives into a dangerous and soul-seeking adventure that is marked by an unexpected polyamorous love story with LGBTQ facets that are as colorful as Berlin.In the process, as you follow Lucia’s story, you’ll learn about ancient traditions that are still practiced by a select few today. You’ll witness old magical and shamanic practices that are discretely held every day in Berlin. In short, more than just following Lucia’s journey, you enter the often overlooked world of Berlin’s magic, fantasy and legends.The Project‘Magic Berlin’ is a large and ambitious project which we plan to develop in different and progressive stages. Our team of creatives has been expanding as the project develops, and we are seeing many opportunities to bring along even more innovative professionals.At the same time, we plan to bring a new work of fantastic fiction to the German audience, as well as to the international public, while we also take a different and charming way of introducing a new perspective of an amazing side of Berlin that almost no one knows.As we take ‘Magic Berlin’ forward, we want it to evolve from a self-created and self-determined collaboration of writers, actors, filmmakers, musicians, photographers, stylists, artists of various professions into a wider community of people who take an active role in making it come true – throughout the different production stages.As the ‘Magic Berlin’ crew and cast, we have been investing a large part of our spare time, skills, performance abilities and own funds to realize this great fiction project and bring it to you. And now we want you to join us – as we have saved one of the most important roles for you:We invite you to join our ‘Magic Berlin’ production community by selecting one of the many exciting rewards that we are offering you here – this way supporting our project and helping to make it happen.This crowdfunding campaign wishes to collect the funding the first third of book one – “Magic Berlin - Der Stern”.

We want to introduce these three Magic Berliners to you!Julia HellerThe artist and freelance career coach, Julia Heller, is the initiator and producer of “Magic Berlin” and author of the “Magic Berlin” story. She strongly believes in the success of the project and never grows tired of pushing things forward. Julia created the idea of “Magic Berlin” as a transmedia web project while brainstorming with her good friend and artist colleague, Kristina Schippling, who is also part of the project as an actress, adviser and with other tasks.Besides leading, forming and constantly working on content for the project, Julia plays the protagonist of the story – ""Lucia Schadland"" – fulfilling herself a childhood dream with acting. She is also the singer of the Berlin electropop band, CLASH CLASH BANG BANG as Moon Princess “Lia Hell” and finds pleasure in expressing herself artfully on many levels, e.g. She dances and sings Argentinian Tango and loves to draw. Julia is interested in natural spirituality, paganism and shamanism and is part of several pagan groups.Aljoscha BelaschkMusician and multitalented creative, Josh is with the team since the beginning and has been involved in almost all departments of the production, helping it to evolve and grow. He is mainly responsible for audio production and music, but also directs, cuts and assists at many other stations. In the story Josh embodies the shaman, ""Göndlirson"".Together with Julia, he is part of CLASH CLASH BANG BANG as the drummer.Lisa BirkholzAlso an irreplaceable part of the inner team since day one is Lisa, who plays the role of ""Eris von Mylo"" as an actress in Magic Berlin and, as a talented young photographer and project manager, takes responsibility for the photo department of the project. Since the beginning, she has been distinguished by her versatility and is indispensable on numerous levels - be it organization, location scouting, trailer production, the look for details, costume and mask. With her warm and cordial nature, she contributes much to strengthen the team spirit of the Magic Berliner.All Magic BerlinerAljoscha Belaschk - audio Supervisor, composer, actor, editor & directorAlina Mart - photographer, teacherAmber Michaele - actress, author, dancerAndreas Malert - actor, role playerBastian G.

He was blessed to be a conduit for writing 365 love poems to the Divine Mother and now publishing them and writing some new ones on a blog as well as in a e-book and/or paper book. The purpose of the project is to inspire the restoration of the Universal Motherhood within and without.

Give and Take!
All donations received for this project support the basic costs of sustaining the body while writing the blog, e-book, and/or paper book. This project has no time frame on it. Look to the right to see what you can take, if you give! %5 will go to Indie Go Go to pay for the %5 processing fees for hosting this.


The Impact of Restoring Poetry Within Blog and Book...

Poems are thoughts. Thoughts are things. Loving and devotional thoughts expressed as poetry prayers to Mother Earth purify the mind and atmosphere with positive vibrations. May this serve life. This project is subject to the law of change, to best serve the  whole. Compassion has no rules. We humbly offer all of these poems & actions to The Divine Mother & Earth.

May all beings in all the worlds be peaceful and happy!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div></div>","Taking inspiration from Rainer Maria Rilke's Letters to a Young Poet, Phyllis Chesler's Letters to a Young Feminist, and Art on Paper's Letters to a Young Artist, I am working to create a collection of essays titled Feminist Advice from the City of Broad Shoulders. I'm an artist, educator, and activist who has been living in Chicago for the last ten years, and have been teaching printmaking at the City College since 2010.

I am
vigilant about creating safe spaces in my classroom for honest, and sometimes
difficult, conversations.  I found
that when I became more vocal about my struggles with patriarchal society and the
problems inherent in my position as a part time adjunct college instructor, my
students, both men and women, opened up and began having conversations about
their personal struggles in school and in life. 


I am a member of the feminist
art collective Tracers, and have participated in numerous workshops and panel
discussions, often speaking about my interest in the democratic nature of
printmaking, most recently at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago,
Columbia College, University of Illinois in Chicago, and New York University in
Florence, Italy. Along with two friends, I
helped reactivate the feminist guerrilla theater group WITCH this past November.






My own essay, which will be edited for this publication, was originally part of a catalog that corresponded with an exhibition at the Franklin, titled Finocchio, that ""Introduce[d] a physical and visual dialog regarding how diversity has become defined as the queer, and how this impacts the materiality and plasticity of self-identity and engagement across conceptual forms of expression."" You can read the accompanying essays here.

<li>My name is Carlos Jiménez Flores. I am a storyteller. It is important for me to keep the art of storytelling alive. Whether it be through poetry, music, song, art, photography, novels, film, etc. I published my first book of poetry in 2004. Since then, I have published a total of seven books of poetry. I have also published two books of photography. I entered the film industry in 2008. Since then, I have written, directed and/or produced twelve feature films. <br/><br/>For this project, I have teamed up with another writer, Luis Martínez, a retired Chicago police officer who has published two books of short stories. After serving and protecting our community for two decades, Luis has entered the next chapter of his life sharing his knowledge and experience with students at the college level as a professor. He is also dedicating time to writing. He is the perfect writing partner in this project because he brings the realism of a criminal investigation into the story, as well as his uncanny storytelling skills.<br/> </li>
<li>Stronger Than the Devil has already been written. The novel is in the final editing phase right now. This project is important to us because it marks the beginning of a journey that sets us on a path to continue to create more work. <br/> </li>
<li>This is the first of many novels to come. What you are helping us achieve by contributing to our campaign is a dream realized. Luis and I have always wanted to write a novel.

The Back Story Continued...
Mary's father Arthur North was the original Adventure Tour Guide.  Her childhood was filled with adventures from the nearby Adirondack Mountains to the Colorado River, Lapland, Mexico and New Zealand. 

These childhood adventures co- existed uneasily with an overdose of Victorian sternness and propriety.  In this memoir she brings the reader into the adventure, exploration, propriety, and tensions of her childhood.  

At age 10 her detail rich account of one adventure, a 300 mile journey by rowboat down the Colorado river, was published by G.P. Putnam's Sons.  What in other circumstances might have launched a life of writing instead blocked her writing for half a century.

                          

Her curiosity and need to express the intricacies and beauties of a world seen with sharp eyes and unending imagination never ceased.  At age 40 she returned to photography, an art she had tinkered with in college. 
She spent the next 40 years of her life capturing the unnoticed beauties and contradictions of light, shadow, and color, simultaneously using this art as the means of both expressing and sorting through the competing forces of her childhood morphed into the struggles of her adult life.

                                                                                                                 

Twenty years success doing and teaching photography gave her the confidence to once again set pen to paper.  She began to write this memoir.  But the old ghosts still haunted her: it was one thing to write, another to accept the writing as ""good enough"" to close the book.

In a 2015 survey by StressinAmerica.org, 72% of respondents reported feeling stressed about their finances. And of all the elements that stressed them most, money topped the list.</p>
<p>I am also a “creature of emotion”—something  I discovered dealing with my own financial dilemmas as well as those experienced by family, friends, and clients. Emotions have the negative power to cause inner turmoil, chaos, and craziness in our daily lives. </p>
<p>As a result of my personal financial pain and my experience as a therapist, coach, and trainer, I want to help people overcome their gloomy and scary emotions connected to money.</p>
<p><i>Money Drama</i> is a must read because it links emotions of fear, anxiety, anger, depression, grief and shame to personal financial struggles. Without making the connection that emotions are tied to money problems, a person can feel powerless and without choices.</p>
<p>Every chapter breaks through once-sacred beliefs using insightful exercises such as What is Your Money Drama Personality Quiz, the Tissue Exercise, the Stop It Exercise, and more. Each exercise is designed to free people emotionally from their own money dramas.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>To give <i>Money Drama</i> the momentum it needs to help people, I am asking for $35,000 to cover the completion of the book cover, editing, layout and design, printing, distribution, and marketing costs. Because I am self-publishing and distributing the book myself, I need a website for distribution, sales, and exposure. And last but not least is help with marketing, and a marketing coach.</p>
<p>If this campaign doesn’t bring in $35,000, I will work with what does comes to me with gratitude and also consider launching a follow-up campaign. I’m determine to publish <i>no matter what! </i></p>
<p>When you donate, you’ll receive some fun and creative perks such as a few lines of inspiration from the book to your email for a $25.00 donation and for $50.00 I will send you a personal invitation to my first book signing and for $100.00 a Money Drama T-shirt reading, <i>I am a Money Drama King or Queen</i>. Pick a perk that makes you happy or sing or just smile as a philanthropist of <i>Money Drama.</i></p>
<p><b>The Impact of <i>Money Drama</i></b></p>
<p>If you were gifted with a greater understanding of how your emotions affect your finances, imagine how much stronger your choices and coping skills would be. Truth is power. <i>Money Drama</i> creates awareness of money as an unhealthy trigger and then provides the initial competence to get emotions under control. Being a philanthropist of <i>Money Drama means making </i>a difference in freeing people from their money worries. </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>I have faced dozens of challenges in my life and overcome them, including earning degrees that allow me to work as a counselor, coach, and trainer. Example stories about my challenges are shared in <i>Money Drama</i>. With this campaign, I’m once again stretching beyond my comfort zone to help others.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Gene Townsel and I'm a Professional Singer/Musician and a Preacher/Teacher of the word of God. </p>
<p>Helping Singers realize their ""Dream"" is my passion. After having performed in major venues around the world and developing singers in my Los Angeles Studio, I am currently the owner of my own studio ""The Source"" in Deerfield Beach Florida and still perform as a solo artist and conducts Singers Workshops for aspiring artists. Having acquired international critical acclaim I have performed on the stages of <strong>Acapulco,</strong> <strong>Tokyo, Bangkok, Singapore, Aruba, Curacao</strong> and <strong>Buenos Aires,</strong> to name a few, as well as major U. S. cities. To date, I have two albums to my credit,<strong> ""Time Wounds All Heels""</strong> that has remained popular in Europe and become a collectors album in the UK and<strong> ""The 23rd Psalm""</strong>, the latter containing the highly acclaimed title song that while being performed at the <strong>1984 National Baptist Convention musical in Los Angeles,</strong> received a standing ovation by some <strong>6,000</strong> listeners.</p>

<p>This project has more than one phase. The first phase that is already under way is the memoir. Upon completion it will go to the editor and then to the printer. Phase two is the new music that is also under way and will soon go into pre-production, The third phase is the packaging of the old and the new music into a 2 CD set that will be sold as a part of the book and as a separate 2 CD set.</p>
<p>With the help of your generous contributions and the sales from the book and CD, the final phase  will be the establishing of a <strong>Performing Arts Cente</strong>r for underprivileged youth. Rather than taking the traditional route of politics, grants etc. to establish the center, I'm going to use my talent and the proceeds from the sale of my book and  music to fund it. The market for the product is my net- work of friends, church community and my fan base in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p> This campaign is to raise the money for the cost of the music production and manufacturing and the publishing of my memoir. The subsequent sales of <strong>“From Seeking Glory, To Giving Glory”</strong>, <i>(The book and CD)</i> will help fund a place where under-privileged kids can have a <u> Performing Arts Center.</u>  </p>
<p>The establishing of a <u>Performing Arts Center</u> here in Deerfield Beach, Florida is sorely needed.  Why here you ask? This is where I grew up with a voice for singing and a hunger for music.

If it wasn’t for the encouragement of my choral music teacher who went the extra mile I never would have realized my dream. Now in many cases what little I had isn’t even available, for as we all know music has been taken out of many schools. In this little town after over fifty years there still isn't a place dedicated to the development of kids with musical talent. Oh there are recreation centers but there are not any dedicated music programs. Giving these talented kids positive mentoring and musical guidance is key to keeping them out of trouble.

<h3>Time Wounds All Heels</h3>
<p><i><strong>The  Re-released Album On CD</strong></i></p>
<p>With my fan base in the United Kingdom from the ""Time Wounds All Heels"" album and my network from my ministry work in the church, I anticipate significant support of this project.

<p><strong><i>Hi Gene, I'm a big fan of your music. 'Time Wounds all Heels' is one of my fave ever LP's.....'I'm Walking Away' is awesome &amp; I didn't realize that it was released as a 45 until very recently, a long shot here, but I don't suppose you have any spare copies still of the 45 of it on Balance Town....I was also wondering if you had ever considered coming over to the UK to perform, there is a small, but very enthusiastic following for your music....    </i></strong><strong><i>Russ Vickers</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Hi Gene, As I am writing this i am playing your Dobre album ""Time wounds all heels"" and am reminded once again that it is one of the greatest soul records of all time.

<h3>My Love, My Soul, My Spirit </h3>
<p><strong><i>New Music CD</i></strong></p>
<p>I'm not just setting out to arbitrarily record some new music but to record music that speaks to a romantic love relationship between a man and a woman that God will smile upon.  Over my adult life I have noticed that songs that express the  love and affection between us as lovers is left to the so  called secular writer who in many instances is not sensitive to or concerned with the Biblical narrative. Personally I love secular love songs and made a career out of singing them around the world but I was always sensitive to the lyrics. </p>
<p>I'm bringing even more sensitivity to  this project as I create songs that speak to the romantic relationship between man and woman based on God's word, as opposed to worship music whose soul purpose is to extol the virtue and power of God. </p>

<p>Some of my friends feel that this project is too big. Well I serve a big God and I don't put limitations on Him or myself. Rather than going through the bureaucratic and political channels of trying to establish a Performing Arts Center for underprivileged youth here in Deerfield Beach, I've decided to use my talents and  my story to generate the necessary funds. My decision is rooted in the fact that if the powers that be (past and present) had any intention of creating such a place, it would exist already. It didn't exist 50 years ago during my formative years and certainly not before that. Given the political climate of today, it's not likely to happen any time soon. It is critical that we give the resources,  direction and incentive to our talented youth.  </p>
<p>With your help and God's favor towards the sale of the CDs and the Book, I'm confident that <strong>THE</strong> <strong>ARTIST'S DREAM PERFORMING ARTS CENTER</strong> will become a reality.</p>

</div></div>","Hi,
My name is Gene Townsel and I'm a Professional Singer/Musician and a Preacher/Teacher of the word of God. 
Helping Singers realize their ""Dream"" is my passion. After having performed in major venues around the world and developing singers in my Los Angeles Studio, I am currently the owner of my own studio ""The Source"" in Deerfield Beach Florida and still perform as a solo artist and conducts Singers Workshops for aspiring artists. Having acquired international critical acclaim I have performed on the stages of Acapulco, Tokyo, Bangkok, Singapore, Aruba, Curacao and Buenos Aires, to name a few, as well as major U. S. cities. To date, I have two albums to my credit, ""Time Wounds All Heels"" that has remained popular in Europe and become a collectors album in the UK and ""The 23rd Psalm"", the latter containing the highly acclaimed title song that while being performed at the 1984 National Baptist Convention musical in Los Angeles, received a standing ovation by some 6,000 listeners.



This project has more than one phase. The first phase that is already under way is the memoir. Upon completion it will go to the editor and then to the printer. Phase two is the new music that is also under way and will soon go into pre-production, The third phase is the packaging of the old and the new music into a 2 CD set that will be sold as a part of the book and as a separate 2 CD set.
With the help of your generous contributions and the sales from the book and CD, the final phase  will be the establishing of a Performing Arts Center for underprivileged youth. Rather than taking the traditional route of politics, grants etc. to establish the center, I'm going to use my talent and the proceeds from the sale of my book and  music to fund it. The market for the product is my net- work of friends, church community and my fan base in the United Kingdom.
 This campaign is to raise the money for the cost of the music production and manufacturing and the publishing of my memoir. The subsequent sales of “From Seeking Glory, To Giving Glory”, (The book and CD) will help fund a place where under-privileged kids can have a  Performing Arts Center.  
The establishing of a Performing Arts Center here in Deerfield Beach, Florida is sorely needed.  Why here you ask? This is where I grew up with a voice for singing and a hunger for music. What I didn’t have, was a place to develop my talent other than the limited time offered at school. If it wasn’t for the encouragement of my choral music teacher who went the extra mile I never would have realized my dream. Now in many cases what little I had isn’t even available, for as we all know music has been taken out of many schools. In this little town after over fifty years there still isn't a place dedicated to the development of kids with musical talent. Oh there are recreation centers but there are not any dedicated music programs. Giving these talented kids positive mentoring and musical guidance is key to keeping them out of trouble. If it wasn’t for the church and the one black high school seven miles away I could very well be a statistic.

FROM SEEKING GLORY, TO GIVING GLORY  is a memoir filled with my triumphs and failures with pictures of memorabilia from my life journey beginning with my childhood in the church and on through  my music career with celebrity encounters such as former student Margaret (Shug) Avery from the ""Color Purple"", Barry White, my first producer before he became a superstar, Sinbad at the beginning of his career when I served as a Judge in the Air Force  talent competition (that he won by the way), and long time friend Dr. Margaret Pleasant Douroux,  one of the most prolific Gospel Song Writers in the nation. Then there was the establishment and development of  a facility for training and providing  services for aspiring and professional    
    
     

artists which was dubbed ""The Gene Townsel Studio Of Theatrical & Musical Arts. The Studio was established in 1976 and closed in 2000 when I moved to Houston. During those years stories were abounding with a who's who list of artists who frequented the facility.  I also founded an anti-drug  program (AADAP) that hosted  an annual Summer Arts Festival at the Studio. Somewhere in the middle of all of that I accepted my calling to the Christian Ministry.     
     
  
       
The book will be packaged with two CDs. The re-released 70s album from the years when I was chasing that elusive star and the new album that will feature songs of inspiration, love and romance.

Rather than going through the bureaucratic and political channels of trying to establish a Performing Arts Center for underprivileged youth here in Deerfield Beach, I've decided to use my talents and  my story to generate the necessary funds. My decision is rooted in the fact that if the powers that be (past and present) had any intention of creating such a place, it would exist already. It didn't exist 50 years ago during my formative years and certainly not before that. Given the political climate of today, it's not likely to happen any time soon. It is critical that we give the resources,  direction and incentive to our talented youth.  
With your help and God's favor towards the sale of the CDs and the Book, I'm confident that THE ARTIST'S DREAM PERFORMING ARTS CENTER will become a reality.


As with any goal, there are some obstacles and risks.
My main hurdle is the financial one, which is why I'm asking for your help! 
My biggest risk is in not meeting my financial goal through this platform, but I have a plan for that! If my goal isn't met here, the funds that are raised will be used to publish the book and re-release the ""Time Wounds All Heels CD) and promote sales through the methods listed below.

Using my network of local churches to help promote sales.
I already have the literature developed for distribution among the churches.
I am also scheduled to attend and perform at the ""SOULTRIP USA Convention  in Las Vegas at the Tropicana Hotel on March 15th-22nd, 2018 where I'll be selling the books, cds, and related product to my fans.

<p><i>Model: Chelsea Simone, the magical human that will grace our October cover &lt;3</i></p>
<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
<p><i>Monachopsis</i> is a submissions-based fashion magazine specializing in editorial photography and other sartorial content including articles, shopping guides, and interviews, centered around a specific theme.  The magazine will be released on a quarterly basis with print and digital issues going live in January, April, July and October.  Print issues will measure 9"" x 11"" and will feature high-quality full-color photography, artworks, and graphics with interspersed text. The website will be updated on a weekly basis and will include content exclusive to the web such as webitorials, style how-tos and tips, and event coverage.</p>
<p>The word “monachopsis,” coming from the dictionary of obscure sorrows, is defined as “the subtle yet persistent feeling of being out of place.”  This term really stuck with us as we were developing a concept for the magazine, as we both know a thing or two about being misfits from our years of bullying, exclusion from events, and just being made to feel weird by our peers for our colorful style choices.  Over the years, we've found <i>many</i> other people who also feel exiled by the industry due to race, sexual orientation, gender, disability, and other reasons--and behold, the magazine was born.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHY THE MAGAZINE?</h3>
<p>Because we were frustrated by how blasé and predictable the fashion industry is (and even more so by the blatant sexism, racism, transphobia, and other discriminatory elements that seem to get glossed over due to the prominence of the patriarchy in publishing), we decided to launch our own magazine.  We want to highlight the people who have creative ideas that might not necessarily jive with the sartorial status quo.  We want to lift up marginalized voices by giving creators a place to submit their work.  We want to create a space free of the pervy male gaze where we can shamelessly talk about fashion and beauty while simultaneously addressing core issues that affect our readers’ everyday lives.  Most of all, we want to showcase amazing work by weirdos, for weirdos, in an environment where representation is a priority and not just a buzzword.</p>

<a href=""http://colleenbrunetti.com/aidan-the-wonderkid/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://colleenbrunetti.com/aidan-the-wonderkid/</a><br/><br/>WELCOME!</h2>
<p>My name is Colleen Brunetti and I am the author of <i>""Aidan the Wonder Kid Who Could Not be Stopped: A Food Allergy Story"".</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Aidan is a super hero with very special powers indeed. With his trusty dog Rocco at his side, there’s nothing he can’t do. But something is making Aidan sick. And when Aidan gets sick, he is very, very droopy. Will his grownups ever figure out what’s stealing his super powers? And how can he find his boundless energy once again? Stay tuned to find out!</i></p>
<p>I'm an educator, a certified health coach, and most importantly, a mom. While the book is superhero fiction, a lot of it really happened! Aidan is my real life son who had real life problems stealing his health and energy - and in time we learned the enemy was food that didn't feed his body just right.<br/><br/>I'll never forget his little face when we had to tell him that some of his favorite foods were the reason he was sick all the time, and that to get better, he was going to have to change how he ate. The idea of no more pizza, ice cream, or cake at birthday parties is sure hard for a little kid to accept!<br/><br/>As I talked to moms all over the country who struggle to support their kids through food issues, I realized kids need to be empowered to take control over their own choices, and to really own the fact that eating a certain way makes them strong and wonderful... even when it's a little bit hard sometimes. So, I decided to get this book out there, <strong><i>and to do it partially as a community service project by making sure I created a system where I could donate my time and some books to local kids too.</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Your contribution is going to help kids like Aidan thrive!</i></strong> I wrote this story for him, and kids with food allergies and intolerances everywhere, to help them take ownership of their health and their food choices. I wanted it to be light and fun, and full of adventure - just like the little boy in my house. </p>
<p><strong>Your contributions is also going to empower stressed out and worried families to educate friends, family, and the school about how to best help their Wonder Kid.</strong> I'll be offering lots of tips, tricks, and kid-friendly recipes to support families who use this book (<i>Check out the Party Survival Guide at the $100 level! It's going to be amazing!</i>)</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's where your money will go: </p>
<p><br/><strong>1) Illustration expenses:</strong> My illustrator is  <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/DanCarstenIllustration/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dan Carsten</a>. As you can see from the concept sketches we've included in our perks list, he's crazy talented. Artists deserve to be well compensated for their work, and we're a fantastic creative team. Approximately the first 50% of the funding goal will go to compensate him for his awesome work. </p>
<p><strong>2) Publication expenses:  </strong>Layout, design, digital conversion for print and eBooks...this stuff takes a ton of time and know-how from a team of professionals, and will be approximately 12 - 15% of the targeted funding goal. <br/><br/><strong>3) Gifts for YOU and the community: </strong>We've got some fabulous donor perks built in here. Starting at just $10, you get a digital copy of the book and at $35 a printed copy, signed by both myself and Dan the illustrator! And then at the higher levels, some fun stuff to go along with it... the production and shipping costs are included in the funds raised. (Hint: <i>You definitely want the WonderKids superhero cape!</i>).<br/><br/>In addition, I'll be donating copies to area schools and libraries (and doing free author appearances which often cost schools a lot of money!)<br/><br/>This section is approximately 15-17% of the funds raised.</p>
<p><strong>4) Book Marketing: </strong>Once the book is out there, I really have to work to put the concept in front of as many people as possible. Long gone are the days when publishing houses do the marketing for you - which is one of the benefits of self-publishing. I have to do it either way, but I have total control over the process. Postcards, bookmarks, copies to send to bloggers for reviews and publicity, stacks of books to bring to events... it all adds up pretty quickly for an independent author! I'm building in roughly 10% for this.</p>
<p><strong>5) Indiegogo Fees: </strong>They take their cut, and so do the the credit card processing companies. It's all good.  I'm budgeting the recommended 8-10%</p>
<p>And if we don't reach our goal... well, let's think positive. We will! But if we don't... the first portion of funds go to the illustrations. And then I'll piece together the technical publication services on a smaller scale. Either way, this book is coming alive and getting out in the world, so this campaign will be a success.</p>

<p>I've dedicated my life to helping kids. From my first career as a public school teacher, to my years as a health coach, I know kids do their best when the learning is fun, the lessons are powerful, and <i>they</i> take ownership.

I also know there are things I'm <i>great</i> at with that process (the writing, project management, marketing, and the post-launch workshops and education opportunities).<br/><br/>There are also things I'm <i>not</i> great at... the kinds of things a traditional publisher would usually handle. The illustrations, the layout and design, and all that pesky technical publishing stuff that I just don't excel at. I did almost <i>all</i> of it myself the first time, and this time I know that to create a book that shines and is successful, I want and need a fabulous team around me. <strong>Your support is helping me build that team!! </strong></p>

I also know there are things I'm great at with that process (the writing, project management, marketing, and the post-launch workshops and education opportunities).There are also things I'm not great at... the kinds of things a traditional publisher would usually handle. The illustrations, the layout and design, and all that pesky technical publishing stuff that I just don't excel at. I did almost all of it myself the first time, and this time I know that to create a book that shines and is successful, I want and need a fabulous team around me. Your support is helping me build that team!! 
I'm confident I have the structure to launch a successful book and get it into the hands of the kids who need it. 
I just need your help getting there!

<h3>About the Book</h3>
<p>This gloriously illustrated children's book illuminates contemporary mixed race life from the point of view of a child. A much needed volume, <i>The Biracial Butterfly </i>shows the beauty and magic of identity, and celebrates the lives of interracial families today.</p>
<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Lennox Benson was born to a teacher and a doctor in Lagos, Nigeria and migrated to London, UK at the age of two.</p>
<p>Raised by his mother, he was gifted many books and became a keen reader. In primary school, he excelled in art and creative writing, and secretly nurtured a dream to write a book of his own one day.</p>
<p>These creative skills were carried into secondary school where he achieved good grades in Art and English. He then went on to study English, Art &amp; Theatre Studies at A level before securing a place at Queen Mary University to study English Literature.</p>
<p>However, after a term at Queen Mary, he found himself unsure of his place in the world as a young, gay black man and left to find himself. He made a concerted effort to look for Black British mentors who could provide some guidance in making sense of his world.</p>
<p>After some months of networking he garnered the support of a few experienced professionals who were able to guide him through this crucial transition from his late teenage years to early adulthood.</p>
<p>After years of trying his hand with different art mediums including acting and dancing, he returned to writing and began work on his first children’s book <i>The Biracial Butterfly</i>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is book is going to be made, whatever happens. However, with your support we can give the book the love it needs. If we successfully fund this project, we'll be able to provide high quality print copies for backers and send copies to schools and reviewers.</p>
<p>Our aim is to provide a mirror for biracial families, who are so often overlooked in today's publishing landscape, and to provide much needed representation for mixed race children.</p>
<p><font>In return for supporting us, you get great benefits such as:</font></p>
<ul>
<li>A signed first edition, first printing copy of <i>The Biracial Butterfly</i>
</li>
<li>A shoutout in the backers' section of the book</li>
<li>Our love and respect</li>
<li>The warm, fuzzy glow of knowing you're helping to raise visibility for biracial families</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We're not asking for much. We have a skilled team working on this book, and we're determined to put this book out there. But what we really need is money to help support our promotional and marketing efforts, and that's where you come in. Your money will help us spread the word about the book, to contact schools and libraries to set up readings around the country, and to submit the book to festivals and prizes.</p>
<p>Anyone can publish a book via print on demand, but making your book stand out against the sea of new titles is hard - and that's what we're looking to do.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Between us, we have experience in media production, marketing and publishing. The book has been written and fully illustrated. The images are being converted to a print-ready file as we speak. The cover is being laid out. The book will be heading to print in 2018 - make no mistake about it.</p>
<p>Dog Horn Publishing has been publishing titles for over a decade. Our books are distributed via NBN International, and represented by Inpress Books, the leading sales and marketing agency for independent presses in the UK. Our titles are available via Amazon, Waterstones and most major retailers, and you can request them in your local library too. We also produce ebook editions available on Kindle, Nook, B&amp;N and Overdrive.</p>
<p>But we're a small venture lacking in people power. For £2,500, we can afford to inject some essential PR and marketing time into the mix. What's more, we can produce extra copies of the book to send to key reviewers, librarians and teachers - which will all raise the visibility of the book.</p>
<p>It's our hope that we get Lennox into schools to read from his book, and to get copies into the hands of the children and parents who'd appreciate them most. We want biracial children to feel they can be the protagonists of their own stories and to see their lives reflected in the literature they read.</p>
<p>As with all Indiegogo campaigns, there will be an element of risk. In this case, however, the risks are few. While it's feasible that real-life problems, unexpected technical issues or an accident with printing might delay publication, the hard work has already been done, so the book will be published in one form or another whatever happens.</p>

<b>ABOUT THE PROJECT</b> </h2><ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This project is about expanding my readership but first and foremost the publication of a new book, <b>HUMOR, LAUGHTER &amp; LIFE,</b> which I believe will have the most comprehensive collection of jokes and anecdotes ever compiled. Should this project be successful I will follow it by publishing paperback versions of my current ebooks including my recipe books which I believe are in a class of their own and my autobiography which will interest anyone who would like to learn how one member of the “the other half” lived in the years from 1941 to date.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">So far only my joke books have been printed and I have sold 6000 copies of the printed versions as a self-publisher but if I am to support myself I need to expand my readership of my existing eBooks, include print versions of my other books in my portfolio and write the new book <b>HUMOR, LAUGHTER &amp; LIFE,</b>. To do this I need your help.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul><h2><b>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</b></h2><ul><li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">My name is Chris Bruce. I retired in 2012 but on 31st July 2014 I became comatose and was diagnosed with End Stage Kidney Failure. After two months in hospital and a year of medical treatment I have exhausted my savings and am now having to rely on my family for financial support. I have launched this campaign to try to expand my readership enough to provide me with some self-support and to give my wife and family some relief from the burden of supporting my medical care. Before my diagnosis I had limited writing success having written 8 joke books, 6 recipe books and an autobiography but, being limited, my success has not been enough to support my extremely expensive medical treatment. Writing is the only way that I can now earn a living. Fortunately I enjoy being an author and it’s my hope that by continuing to write I will be able to relieve my family of some of the burden I have imposed on them and live a little longer! To this end I am writing a new book named <b>HUMOR, LAUGHTER &amp; LIFE. </b></span><br/>
</li></ul><h2>WHY JOKE AND RECIPE BOOKS AND AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY?</h2><ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I inherited my sense of humor from my mother who would find something funny or ironic in almost any situation, good or bad. I’ve never been any good at telling jokes or repeating anecdotes whether my own or by others but I have been good at collecting and recording them and, by compiling the joke books, I have been able to give others the opportunity to both enjoy and re-tell the jokes. Whether clean or “risqué/adult”, in context the jokes I have collected have been carefully selected for their funniness. Risqué or slightly smutty jokes you will find in all my “adult” books but not jokes of a gratuitous or salacious nature. Funniness is always the criteria for all jokes.</span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438487401/wpo4stwg4z2ieiwh1su0.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; width: 210.144578313253px; height: 306px; background-color: initial;""/>

These all stem from my ventures into producing both fresh and processed sausage in restaurants I had an interest in and a sausage factory I built and operated in the course of my long career. I had to research, record and adapt hundreds of recipes for both the restaurants and the factory and it is these recipes upon which my sausage making and recipe books are based.</span>

<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I also developed an interest in making liqueurs in Thailand, inspired by the wide variety of fruit there. I developed liqueur recipes and tested them but never managed to establish a factory due to impossible regulation requirements and the huge amount of money required to fund it.</span><br/>

<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Finally, my life has been a very interesting, if not very financially rewarding, one. I was born in England, emigrated to Namibia, went to university in South Africa, started a construction company in Namibia and built numerous buildings under fire during the South African/Angolan Border war, learnt to fly and had a long career working in 7 countries. I have lived through some of the most important events in world history in recent times and I’ve correlated these events with the history of my life. My autobiography is an unusual one.</span><br/>

</ul><h2>WHY I NEED YOUR HELP </h2><ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Besides the jokes already published and printed in my books I have hundreds more, as yet unpublished, jokes and anecdotes that have provided me personally with hours of entertainment. I want to publish a selection of the best jokes in one book with numerous, easily referenced, categories thus giving as many people as possible the opportunity to relax a little with a book of really funny jokes, anecdotes and tall tales and to provide a source of really good humorous matériel for use in speeches and at social occasions of every description. The book is named <b>HUMOR, LAUGHTER &amp; LIFE.</b> Even if you can’t contribute financially you can send me a joke or anecdote for inclusion and acknowledgement in the book. I will even include your name in a joke; with your permission of course. In this new book readers will be able to find a joke in any category ranging from the oddities of the English language to riotous religion and everything in between. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">My recipe books have only been published as eBooks. While these have been well received as digital books they are not in an ideal format to work with in the kitchen. The kitchen is one area where it is not advisable to have your e-reader, iPad or laptop lying around. I would very much like to get print versions of these books made.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">My autobiography, Autobiography of an Unknown Man, has been very well received by the few people who have read it, all of whom have encouraged me to publish it because of the insight it gives into an unusual life lived through 75 years of world history in some very unfamiliar places. This book will appeal to autobiography aficionados. I hope that one day I will be able to have it printed.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">As most of you will know, publishing is not for the faint hearted. It is a very difficult and time consuming business and as a result many great or interesting works never see the light of day. </span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I have some paperback copies of some, but not all, of my joke books in stock and am offering these as perks but the shipping cost makes these a little expensive so I am also offering digital versions of all my books as a much cheaper option even if you decide to print them out on your personal printer.</span></li>

</ul><h3>PLEASE DONATE NOW AND HELP ME TO BRING THIS NEW BOOK TO LIFE.</h3></div>","ABOUT THE PROJECT 

This project is about expanding my readership but first and foremost the publication of a new book, HUMOR, LAUGHTER & LIFE, which I believe will have the most comprehensive collection of jokes and anecdotes ever compiled. Should this project be successful I will follow it by publishing paperback versions of my current ebooks including my recipe books which I believe are in a class of their own and my autobiography which will interest anyone who would like to learn how one member of the “the other half” lived in the years from 1941 to date.


So far only my joke books have been printed and I have sold 6000 copies of the printed versions as a self-publisher but if I am to support myself I need to expand my readership of my existing eBooks, include print versions of my other books in my portfolio and write the new book HUMOR, LAUGHTER & LIFE,. To do this I need your help.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR
My name is Chris Bruce. I retired in 2012 but on 31st July 2014 I became comatose and was diagnosed with End Stage Kidney Failure. After two months in hospital and a year of medical treatment I have exhausted my savings and am now having to rely on my family for financial support. I have launched this campaign to try to expand my readership enough to provide me with some self-support and to give my wife and family some relief from the burden of supporting my medical care. Before my diagnosis I had limited writing success having written 8 joke books, 6 recipe books and an autobiography but, being limited, my success has not been enough to support my extremely expensive medical treatment. Writing is the only way that I can now earn a living. Fortunately I enjoy being an author and it’s my hope that by continuing to write I will be able to relieve my family of some of the burden I have imposed on them and live a little longer! To this end I am writing a new book named HUMOR, LAUGHTER & LIFE. 
WHY JOKE AND RECIPE BOOKS AND AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY?

I inherited my sense of humor from my mother who would find something funny or ironic in almost any situation, good or bad. I’ve never been any good at telling jokes or repeating anecdotes whether my own or by others but I have been good at collecting and recording them and, by compiling the joke books, I have been able to give others the opportunity to both enjoy and re-tell the jokes. Whether clean or “risqué/adult”, in context the jokes I have collected have been carefully selected for their funniness. Risqué or slightly smutty jokes you will find in all my “adult” books but not jokes of a gratuitous or salacious nature. Funniness is always the criteria for all jokes.


 Well, what about your recipe books you may ask? These all stem from my ventures into producing both fresh and processed sausage in restaurants I had an interest in and a sausage factory I built and operated in the course of my long career. I had to research, record and adapt hundreds of recipes for both the restaurants and the factory and it is these recipes upon which my sausage making and recipe books are based.



I also developed an interest in making liqueurs in Thailand, inspired by the wide variety of fruit there. I developed liqueur recipes and tested them but never managed to establish a factory due to impossible regulation requirements and the huge amount of money required to fund it.



Finally, my life has been a very interesting, if not very financially rewarding, one. I was born in England, emigrated to Namibia, went to university in South Africa, started a construction company in Namibia and built numerous buildings under fire during the South African/Angolan Border war, learnt to fly and had a long career working in 7 countries. I have lived through some of the most important events in world history in recent times and I’ve correlated these events with the history of my life. My autobiography is an unusual one.


WHY I NEED YOUR HELP 

Besides the jokes already published and printed in my books I have hundreds more, as yet unpublished, jokes and anecdotes that have provided me personally with hours of entertainment. I want to publish a selection of the best jokes in one book with numerous, easily referenced, categories thus giving as many people as possible the opportunity to relax a little with a book of really funny jokes, anecdotes and tall tales and to provide a source of really good humorous matériel for use in speeches and at social occasions of every description. The book is named HUMOR, LAUGHTER & LIFE. Even if you can’t contribute financially you can send me a joke or anecdote for inclusion and acknowledgement in the book. I will even include your name in a joke; with your permission of course. In this new book readers will be able to find a joke in any category ranging from the oddities of the English language to riotous religion and everything in between. 


My recipe books have only been published as eBooks. While these have been well received as digital books they are not in an ideal format to work with in the kitchen. The kitchen is one area where it is not advisable to have your e-reader, iPad or laptop lying around. I would very much like to get print versions of these books made.


My autobiography, Autobiography of an Unknown Man, has been very well received by the few people who have read it, all of whom have encouraged me to publish it because of the insight it gives into an unusual life lived through 75 years of world history in some very unfamiliar places. This book will appeal to autobiography aficionados. I hope that one day I will be able to have it printed.


As most of you will know, publishing is not for the faint hearted. It is a very difficult and time consuming business and as a result many great or interesting works never see the light of day. 

I have some paperback copies of some, but not all, of my joke books in stock and am offering these as perks but the shipping cost makes these a little expensive so I am also offering digital versions of all my books as a much cheaper option even if you decide to print them out on your personal printer.

After a long wait, he is bought by a kind old lady who packs him in a care package and sends him to a deployed soldier. The soldier and his comrades take Buddy on many adventures and he eventually goes home with the soldier and becomes part of a family. All of Buddy's dreams come true! We want to inspire children to dream big! Buddy the Soldier bear is so much more than just a book and stuffed animal - it's a movement! Join #BuddysArmy! </p>
<p>This charming tale is the debut of Marie Joy Monroe, the daughter of a WW II veteran and mother of a young man (Ryan Monroe) who served in the Army in Iraq and Afghanistan. Throughout his several deployments, Marie and her grassroots organization, Operation Hugs From Home, sent 1000's of care packages and letters to soldiers over the years. Marie's goal was always to make the soldiers feel appreciated, and as if they were receiving a literal hug from home. </p>
<p>One of the soldiers who was deployed with Marie's son and received care packages and letters from Marie was Brandon Pollard, the illustrator who brought Buddy to life. Brandon is out of the Army now, and recently graduated from the Portland Art Institute. He is immensely talented. His depiction of Buddy and the adventures he went on with the soldiers could only truly be illustrated by a veteran who had served himself. </p>
<p>Marie no longer runs Operation Hugs From Home, but has instead opted to join ranks with the Central AZ3 Blue Star Moms, her local chapter of Blue Star Mothers of America. With them, she still regularly packs care packages which are shipped to soldiers on a monthly basis. Marie's hope is to get Buddy printed and many of the stuffed bears made. A portion of the profits will go to Central AZ3 Blue Star Moms and other nonprofit organizations who help soldiers in some manner. She hopes to also partner with an organization that helps soldiers with PTSD. It's her passion to help soldiers and show them how much we care. With your help, we can launch the book and stuffed bear and help many of our brave warriors. The book also talks about dreams coming true and Marie hopes to inspire children to dream BIG and let them know that their dreams can come true. </p>
<p>Please help us to achieve our goal! Even a small donation will help! </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>Our goal is $25,000. Yes, that sounds like a lot of money, but printing books is expensive and having a stuffed animal made in the USA is even more expensive. Marie is passionate about not outsourcing the manufacturing to another country and wants to keep those jobs at home! With the $25,000, we can get 1,000 paperback books printed, 500 hard cover books printed, 1,000 stuffed bears made, invest in some marketing, and throw a fabulous launch party. If we exceed our goal, our stretch goal is $50,000. With that, we will be able to donate books to public libraries, schools, and military support groups. If we exceed the stretch goal, we will definitely have even more books printed, bears made, and items such as t-shirts, bookmarks, stickers, coloring books, and other Buddy memorabilia. We'd also love suggestions from our fans with ideas for other Buddy merchandise. The more money we are able to raise, the more books will also be donated to public libraries and schools. </p>

<h2><strong>Who is the Author?</strong></h2>
<p>         My name is Drew Parsons, West Chester University student and an outspoken, strong-willed nerd.</p>
<p>          I've aspired to be an author of some sort since I was around twelve. I used to be obsessed with being hired by SEGA, and writing plots for my favorite game series. From there, I went on to become a fanfiction writer for five years, until at 18, when I decided to use my talents seriously. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the result of six years of effort into one series and the production of its first title.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What is <i>CONTROL</i>?</strong></h2>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495585132/uhnggbpzpflqh7irhmvi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>          CONTROL has been my passion project throughout my entire adult life thus far. A tale of a world rising from the shambles of a home-brewed apocalypse and discovering their place in reality. An introspection on the nature of what it means to be in control of anything, even yourself. A modern epic told through the eyes of everyday people forced to take up the mantle of modern gods. The beginning of all of this is wrapped into these pages.</p>
<p>          But of course, it cannot be completed without your help. The book is written, the cover art is made, but seeing as I'm privately publishing, I need printing funds, advertising funds, and to have my own website and online store constructed.</p>
<h3>          Of course, if you'd like a sample of this completed book, then look no further. The first chapter is right here for you! (Mild profanity filter applied as per Indiegogo guidelines)<br/> </h3>
<p>          Lightning splits shimmering skies upon the horizon of a barren, war-scarred wasteland. Clouds reflect the hue of the bloodstained soil below, flowing between cracks of dry and lifeless desert. Gravel shifts and crunches beneath the feet of marching warriors. Bodies of countless inhuman gods lay scattered across the valley in beaten heaps, as the victors stand above them. Animalistic maws grin down to fallen defenders, fangs bared and tongues rolling out in sadistic glee as they take untold pleasure in conquering the supposedly mighty ‘heroes’ of the once great United States. At the center of them all stands one lone victor towering over his greatest foe to date, his face in the dirt.</p>
<p>            The horned titan stands above a fallen lion, his pride now broken as blood flows from between his fangs among gags. He grips a collection of broken ribs with a shattered hand covered in a crimson gauntlet, struggling to steady his erratic breath. The bull standing over him laughs. “You’ve fought well, but this country is ours now. The government was failing already, and their last failure was to entrust you with their safety.” With a right-handed thrust, the bull stabs his hefty blade into the dirt beside his fallen foe. The dim lights of sunset through reddened sand and stormclouds reflect off its blackened edge, showing the fallen a bloody reflection of his broken army. “Now I’ll give you one last chance. You treat your battalion like family. If you care for them so much, you’ll end your life here and now, with my sword.” A sadistic grin encompasses the bull’s face, his eyes beginning to project a gentle yet eerie gray. “Then, I’ll spare the rest and let them join me.”</p>
<p>            The lion on his knees before the hulking horned brute struggles to push himself upright, gripping the hilt of the sacrificial blade. His eyes remain hidden by the bangs of his mane, soaked in blood and weighed down from its usual flare. He grits his teeth, his ears ringing as the trauma to his head leaves all senses dulled. The world spins around him, clouding all sights and feeling. He can barely see his comrades on their knees and laid across the scorched earth as the tyrant’s thugs hold them down. And yet, he can still hear the cries of pain and defiance surrounding him. Fallen brothers, sisters, warriors whom he’d taken in out of not obligation of any sort, but trust and compassion. He could finally hear the shuffling of gravel beneath feet before him as his opponent turned to leave. The bull was certain of his victory, certain he had already won and taken the west for himself. All that would remain would be to march eastward and capture the defenseless masses awaiting their new ruler. How many other tyrants had the lion brought to their knees? How many other cities had he freed from the chaos of this new world? Was it all for naught now?</p>
<p>            A chuckle escapes the lion’s blood-stained lips. “Ya know… I’ve come a hell of a long way to just get to my death bed, haven’t I..?”</p>

<p>            “Oy, boss.” A chiseled, grizzly man in his early twenties steps through a curtain of hanging chains into what he and his companions have come to call ‘the lounge’. His tired eyes scan across the deflated bean bags and flat tires that litter the floor and an overturned cooler sitting in the corner beside multiple emptied beer cases. All of this was then decorated by a slew of oil stains, spatters of blood, a stray tooth here and there, and the occasional remains of the boss’s latest binge. Sitting upon one of these many bean bags, stacked upon a tire, was what appeared to be a man quite a few years his junior, not even a legal adult yet by the looks of him. He wears a tattered and stained black tank top, matching the darkened oil spots of his faded jeans, the ankles shredded away into a fray of hair-like white thread halfway up his shins, just above the blood-stained leather boots upon his feet. His jet black mohawk stood tall and pointed at six peaks, a detail that would normally be distracting, if not for the menace within his swamp green eyes, split horizontally into twin pupils.<br/><br/>            “What the hell is it now, Artie?” His voice is high-pitched, grating, yet rough and stern.<br/><br/>            Artie stumbles as he catches the boss’s eyes, quickly turning away and looking back out through the doorway. He can’t help but stammer under his boss’s watchful gaze. “U-Uh, we’ve found someone at the door. Probably a new recruit, but he passed out just after we’d let ‘em in.” His frantic rambling trails off as turns back to face his boss. “W-What should we do about him, Cody?”<br/><br/>            Cody raises an eyebrow for just a moment. It’s been quite a while since any of his subordinates, even old friends among them, called him by name. He pulls himself to his feet and steps past Artie with hands deep in his pockets. “Time to greet the newbie then. I’ve been looking forward to the next initiation…” A wide, toothy grin spreads across his face, teeth yellowed and jagged. Multiple heads turn as the heavy clicking of his boots upon the concrete floor echoes within the abandoned garage. Fools swinging from chains and drumming away at tin barrels suddenly go silent. A group of young drunks perched up on the empty lift fall eerily still from the midst of frantic laughter. As the undeniable alpha of their gang steps up, various animal traits and appendages twitch in anticipation. The occasional tail grows eerily still, feral eyes dilating as they take everything in. Claws unsheathe unconsciously as they wait to sink into anything upon an order. Disturbing clicks and buzzes echo throughout the garage.</p>
<p>            In the center of the room, a young man lays motionless on the floor, face shrouded by an overgrown mess of dark chocolate hair. His black jacket bore tears and holes revealing a red tee beneath, matching black cargo jeans and a pair of old, beaten sandals. A handful of cretins gathering around him dig into the many pockets of his coat, collecting batteries, an old handheld game system, some protein bars, and two old photos seemingly of their new victim with two friends in one and his family of four in the other.</p>
<p>              Cody snorts at the sight of him. “So, this is the little **** you dragged in, huh? He’s even younger than me…” He kicks the helpless young man in the ribs. “And got the hell kicked out of ‘im already. He’ll be useless to us. Probly just some beggar asking us to let up on the taxes.” He huffs and snaps his fingers. “Roll ‘im over, wanna get a look at this guy’s face. Might know the lil **** from somewhere.” Heeding their leader’s word, two burlier members of the group roll the new arrival onto his back, revealing a rather pasty complexion and a strong chin, barely covered in thin, sparse stubble.</p>
<p>            One of the women off to the side chuckles, playing with her greasy blonde hair. “This one’s just some clueless kid, kick him back to the streets boss.”</p>
<p>            Cody nods. “Yeah, get ‘im out. Got no use for anyone so weak.” Upon the boss’s command, the seemingly unconscious teen was heaved up by his arms, feet dragging across the concrete floor as the guards carry him back to the open garage door.</p>
<p>            Before the henchmen could get anywhere near the garage’s open front, a burst of crimson flame erupts from the limp captive between them, tossing the two aside in the blast. Before them now stands not a man, but a beast. His skin is hidden by a thick coat of deep brown fur marked with occasional darkened stripes, a shaggy mane across his head and framing his face. He’s held up by a pair of triple-jointed feral legs, black feline claws emerging from his toes. As the flames die down, he turns and glares into the eyes of their leader, swamp green meeting deep sapphire. “Not much for hospitality, are you? No wonder the whole town wants you dead.”</p>
<p>            The utterance of those words summoned down chaos. Bursts of colored flame and lightning consume the men and women scattered across the room, taking on equally if not more beastly forms, screams of rage erupting from their animalistic maws. The lion at the center of this storm of claws allows a wild grin to spread across his face. As they all take their time with delayed transformations, he kneels down to collect the photos they stole from him and dropped. Upon standing, he swings to his left and out of his upper left pocket, backhanding a man turned bipedal gecko in his face hard enough to send him barreling into one of his cohorts nearly fifteen feet away. As a set of feline claws swipe by his face, he falls onto his still outstretched left hand and swings an upwards heel kick into his assailant’s chest, sending them straight into the ceiling. As he feels an incoming burst of heat, he pedals off his hand and into the air over a wave of flames across the floor. Multiple others are caught in the attempted attack.</p>
<p>            Once on his feet, he launches a spin-kick into a young man’s shoulder, only to have his heel catch against their stone-covered hand. The target still skids a foot or so to his side, before a series of stones from the gravel scattered about gathers on his right forearm, forming a thick gauntlet to match the other. The feline hunter positions himself in a left-forward stance, allowing a collection of slow, stumbling blows to be thrown his way. He grows tired of it quickly and rushes past their last strike, grabbing his foe by the throat and using him as a living shield against a jet of flame unleashed from a nearby humanoid hawk’s bare hands. The meat shield screams out in pain for just a moment until he’s thrown into the pyro with enough force to generate the audible snap of breaking ribs.</p>
<p>            Silence falls for just a moment, until an unsightly humanoid insect with a deep tan carapace and sideways jaw dives down in an attempt of a sneak attack. His battle cry gives him away, resulting in a painful elbow to the cheekbone. They’re tossed aside through a collection of barrels and cans and barrels, causing gas and oil spill across the floor. And yet, the hunter’s azure eyes remain focused on swamp green, silence passing between the two for several moments.<br/><br/>            “… Alright, not bad.” Cody begins to pace. “You’ve got power. A lot more than those chumps. So I guess I can let you join as second in command.”<br/><br/>            The hunter snorts. “I’m not here to join, Cody. I’m here on behalf of the citizens of Spring City. The people you’ve been bleeding dry for weeks. Now, the next thing to bleed will be you.”</p>
<p>            The prey lets out a raspy, grim chuckle, gray flames forming around his feet. It flows in a motion akin to razors scraping past one another, sparking lightning along their edges. “You really think you can take me? News flash. I’m the strongest guy in this town, and probably for several around here. On top of that, I’ve already caught ya’ disarmed.” His eyes drift down to the space beneath the crimson hunter’s right elbow, to find nothing but a two inch stump already healed shut, unscarred and grown over with fresh fur. “Even if ya are a leftie, I’ve still got the upper hand, and one more than you.” With a sudden burst of silver fire, he emerges with rubbery, yet spike-covered gunmetal gray skin, his pupils still split sideways, and webs of skin between his fingers.</p>
<p>            The hunter raises an eyebrow. “Ah, a horned toad. That’s new.” He remarks as he shifts himself into a right-foot-forward stance, fist held up at hip level. “Stop yapping already and fight me, so I can get out of here.”</p>
<p>            That did it. The punk’s lips and brow curl into an almost painful scowl, his limbs twitching spastically. He backflips into the wall and plants his feet upon it, before kicking off and launching himself at inhuman speed. A thick layer of spikes and blades of hardened skin form along his right arm and grow outwards into a jagged two foot mass past his hand, swinging in to shred the hunter.</p>
<p>            Hair hangs down from the lion’s mane and casts a shadow over his eyes as he pivots to in on his right foot. He swings in his left fist at speeds the toad’s mutant eyes couldn’t track. Before Cody can register what had happened, he finds himself kneeling on the floor behind the lion, holding a broken arm. The man who broke it begins walking away with a bleeding, but visibly healing hand hanging at his side. He speaks with his back turned. “You made a lot of mistakes, Cody. First was killing the local police and taking over this town.” Cody looks up with a bloodshot glare, a constant twitch in the fingers of his functioning arm. “Next was sucking this town dry and taking everything they had to sate your own craving for power and attention.” As he walks away, back turned to the furious toad, his form is consumed in another crimson burst, returning to a human state. “Third was taking me in.” He can hear electricity sparking among the extended spikes upon his target’s back and between his horns. He ignores this and takes a moment to pick up his discarded jacket and pull it back on. “Fourth was calling me a worthless kid. I’m seventeen, damnit. And last…”</p>
<p>            As the young hunter steps through the door, he hears the deep sigh of a flame’s ignition, and almost immediately after, feels the gust of an explosion blowing past him. Debris and smoke follow in its wake, careening over his shoulder. Small smoldering scraps bounce off his back. “Using electricity in a room full of spilled oil and gas.”</p>
<p>            An exasperated breath escapes the victor’s lips and he runs his remaining hand through his overgrown hair. The gravel driveway crunches beneath his feet as flames lick at his heels and scorch the stone. “That was uneventful. Just another group of punks with big heads.” He steps out onto the side of the road and starts walking along Route 724 headed south, allowing his mind to wander over the past few months, contemplating the chaos that had consumed the world. It’s funny how one day can bring all civilization to its knees, and all thanks to its own people.  </p>
<p>            June 12th 2013. It had been a completely ordinary day, and yet, in an instant, all that had once been considered normal was left behind in a brilliant flash of multicolored lights across the skies. Within seconds, the heavens grew dark and foreboding as lightning tore through the air, and gale force winds rocked wilderness and city alike. Flowing lights, like color changing fire, flooded from holes in the clouds and sunk into all it could reach. Since then, names for this event have been tossed around by theorists and information brokers. Nowadays, most people call it The Breach, in lieu of any more apocalyptically inspired names.</p>
<p>            The moment the sky opened up, people around the world were changed. Their bones were reshaped, shrinking and growing on their own accord, as their skin and internal organs shifted to match. New limbs were grown, skin replaced with insectoid exoskeletons or scales, or covered in thick fur. Their bodies became both human and beast in one, with the advantages and talents of these creatures on a human scale, and yet, improved further. A grand step in evolution, yet no person affected was alike. Within moments of taking on these forms the many whom had fallen victim to the transformation began to instinctively trigger new abilities, powers that were far from biological.</p>
<p>            Most found they were faster and stronger. Others would find themselves able to control the elements or spit poisons. Equally vast were those whose powers were obscure and difficult to label. One occasion that stuck out in the wandering young man’s head was meeting a boy who could perfectly adhere himself to anything… and nothing else. Kind of a useless power, really.</p>
<p>            The results of these changes were almost immediate. As random civilians around the world discovered their superhuman abilities, they were put to use for fulfilling their formerly impossible desires. They felt unstoppable, and in many ways, were. Institutions and prisons burned to the ground, inmates escaped, students left without futures, businesses left unattended. Psychotic individuals now lacking any form of restriction took to the streets in mass, and with their march, society fell.</p>
<p>            This new way of life has become the norm in the three months since. Scavenge for food, avoid any mutants you see passing by - beings that had been since dubbed ‘Unleashed’- and hope your home remained your own. If you weren’t among those following this pattern, you were one of the many taking advantage of this world of anarchy, displaying your newfound power in order to make a living.</p>
<p>            The road ahead is a testament to the decay of civilization. Abandoned cars litter the streets, strewn about at odd angles. Some are crashed into one another or abandoned in ditches. A few are embedded into the guardrails. Occasionally, dried blood can be found in the seats and windshields. The bodies didn’t last long. A five foot tall buzzard atop one of the vehicles could attest to that. It ignores the vagabond with the soul of a lion as he passes. It knows better than to attack an Unleashed.</p>
<p>            Hours into his trek, he ventures into the borders of Phoenixville, cringing upon the sight of these all too familiar streets. Sidewalks crumbled, the graveyard to his right now in shambles, and the pizza parlor was reduced to rubble. “Damnit. Really liked their calzones.” An echoing car alarm blares in the distance, only for the battery to die out within seconds, allowing silence to overcome the urban terrain once more. His tired eyes pan to the shattered windows and broken doors, until resting upon the sight of an intact door, surrounded by boarded windows upon a backdrop of faded brick. It was the right half of one of the many duplexes lining this old street. Most of the surrounding buildings appear nearly untouched, almost like the apocalypse never happened. He ventures up to the door and kicks a few pieces of debris, scraps of metal from who knows where to fallen roof tiles. The sounds echo through the otherwise silent streets.</p>
<p>            By the time he reaches the door, he finds it already cracked open. A husky voice addresses him from behind it. “Alright, the hell are you doin here? Be careful with your words. I’m in no mood to deal with any threats.”</p>
<p><br/>            A faint chuckle escapes the vagabond’s lips, leaning against the doorway with his left hand. “You seriously gonna greet an old friend like that, Mason?”</p>
<p>            Silence falls for just a moment until the door’s thrown open to reveal a tall, gangly teen with vibrant white crew-cut hair. Not even as yellowed as platinum blonde, but albino white, contrasting his earthy eyes as they fell upon his visitor. “Scott? The hell are you doing here? I thought you were dead!” He leans in the doorway and sizes up his old friend, his gaze lingering on Scott’s right side for a moment.</p>
<p>            Scott raises his arms in a nearly comical shrug, leaving his right sleeve to hang off his stumped elbow. “Thought I was too for a while. You gonna invite me in, or is that thick head stuck in the doorway?”</p>
<p>            With a roll of his eyes, Mason steps away and holds the door, letting Scott pass through, and leading to a few sighs of relief throughout the living room. His mother wearily lifts herself from her seat and wraps her scrawny arms around Scott in a tight embrace. Her own hair’s grayed quite a bit since they last met, the stress of these past few months having aged her by decades. Despite the constant sagging in her tired face, her smile is as inviting as ever. “Oh thank God you’re alive. When I heard about the massacre out there, I thought-”<br/><br/>            “Please, I’m fine, you don’t need to worry!” Scott slowly pries himself from her arms and removes his jacket, seeming rather practiced in functioning without a right hand as he tosses his jacket across the room and onto the coat rack by the door with his stumped elbow. Despite the faintly grim reactions of his peers, he saunters across the unpolished hardwood floor over to a nearby chair and drops into place. The dimly lit home soothes him for a few moments as he takes in the familiar scents of cinnamon and wet wood that constantly permeate this house. In spite of that, he only allows that peace and silence to remain for a few moments before getting to all the questions on everyone’s minds. “So were you all here at home when it went down?”</p>
<p>            Mason nods as he leans back against the wall. “Yeah… My parents and I were the only ones awake when The Breach hit. Father was out drinking.” He crosses his arms and closes his eyes, drifting into memories. “He didn’t like seeing me when he got home. Or Sadie…” He peeks across the room to his youngest sister, curled up on the couch with petite horns poking out of her hair. “Started ranting about us being demons.” He casts his gaze back to Scott. “…Had no choice in the end. He’s buried out back.”</p>
<p>            Scott hunches over and grunts, staring off into empty space. Mr. Bowers’ bigotry was no news to him. “So… How far into hell has this town fallen?”</p>
<p>            They look amongst each other for a moment before Mrs. Bowers looks to Mason with prying eyes. He sighs and paces about the room, roughly rubbing at the back of his neck as the stained floorboards creak beneath him. “Well, it was pretty far at first. People started changing, and half the town started burning. The high school was blown up a few minutes in. Apparently someone with combustion powers put in a little too much effort. Within a few days, things settled down enough for people to hide in their own homes, if they still had ‘em.” He leans against the wall with crossed arms, letting a quick flare of black and white flames surround him for a moment. “I happened to keep this place intact.”</p>
<p>            “Well, that explains the white hair.” Scott shrugs. “Seen weirder shit out of Unleashed before…” Scott leans forward and props himself up with an elbow on the left armrest to his chair. “Pretty sure last week I saw a guy with antennae in his dormant form.”</p>
<p>            Mason groans and lowers his head. “Yeah, well, it’s not as bad as Richie.” Scott’s brow furled at the mention of that name, mumbling ‘Richie Anderson’ to himself. “The dick’s been ‘roided out since The Breach and made a new home out of the bank. Rumor has it when he took over he tore the vault door off with his bare hands and flattened someone with it. But…”<br/><br/>            Scott knew the look on his face. That smirk spoke of rebellion. The last time he’d seen it was in the process of unleashing what had to be the best senior prank he’d ever seen, consisting of a homemade mix tape, an agent in the staff, and a misplaced key.</p>
<p>            Mason begins to pace. “There’s a team comin’ together. People from across the state have started gathering here, one of ‘em was even a big player in Paoli’s home team when the first raiding parties arrived. So far, they’re gathered up in a base we set up across town. Well-hidden and kind of out of the way for most survivors here. As long as we approach quietly and watch our backs, we’ll be safe from any raids.”</p>
<p>            Silence falls throughout the room as all eyes fall upon Scott, his own gaze falling upon something imperceptible, glazed yet focused. “Alright then...” He turns to face Mason with stone-faced determination. His limbs are loose and relaxed, yet the steel in his back and fire in his eyes speaks volumes. “Where do I sign up?”</p>
<p>            Mason grins from ear to ear, stepping up and taking Scott’s hand with a renewed passion and lifting him from his seat. “We’ll have to go after sunset, make sure we stay hidden. After midnight would probably be best. So, go crash up in my room for a while, and I’ll come grab ya later.” He pats Scott’s back and sends him off towards the stairs, as Scott gives him a casual two-fingered salute.</p>
<p>            “Thanks. Could use a rest after dealin’ with… I think was about fifteen dipshits runnin’ a gang out of a garage a town over.” Scott snorts as he marches up the creaky steps. “Over half of em bailed in the middle of the fight to save their own asses.” He yawns and trails off upon stepping into a room full of old games and consoles that no longer worked thanks to the lack of electricity. Some ornate weapons hang on the walls, most too dull to be of any use in cutting and all likely too fragile to be of any worth in combat. Chuckling to himself, he kicks off his sandals and collapses into the bed, staring at the ceiling in silence for several minutes. He hears the Bowers chattering amongst themselves below, but having finally found a peaceful place to rest, he drifts off into the deepest sleep he’s had in months.</p>
<h3><strong>          ...And thus begins the tale of Scott's biggest mistake and how it eventually both saves and dooms the world. </strong></h3>

<h2><strong>What is Kairos Publishing?</strong></h2>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495585081/hwxsuhbokmicjoqvvhhg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>          My dream for a brighter future in publishing. The current industry is rife with corruption and limits the creative rights of its customers, the authors. What I intend to do is remedy that with a publishing company by authors and for authors. I'll already be making plenty off my own work. Why should I need to take so much income from another author's work? Why make millions off of what isn't mine? I see no need, and I intend to return that income to the authors. A humbler company for a fairer industry.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Do I Need and Why?</h3>
<p>          So, here's where your funding comes in.</p>
<p>          I'll need enough to produce a few thousand copies of the physical book for the first wave of sales. My most hopeful but unlikely goal is around ten thousand, hence the fifty thousand goal. Sadly, fifty thousand will not be enough after taxes and other expenses, but it's a good start.<br/><br/>          Then comes the costs of producing, hosting, and maintaining a website. This site will, at its core, be for Kairos Publishing, but will include pages specifically for CONTROL and an online store selling the CONTROL book series and other upcoming publications and products. (More on other products later)<br/><br/>          Other lesser expenses will also include an improved office space for managing this endeavor and producing later titles, as my current hardware is wearing is a bit thin.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What do I get Out of This?</strong></h2>
<p>          Donators will be able to recieve the following prizes for their generous donations!</p>
<ul>
<li>7$ for a pre-ordered copy of the ebook, to be recieved by email. This will be a 3rd party file rather than a Kindle file, but it will be functional on a Kindle device.</li>
<li>9$ for a pre-release copy of the ebook, two weeks before the official sale date!</li>
<li>16$ for a pre-ordered copy of the printed novel in paperback.</li>
<li>20$ for a signed copy! With your help, this series may one day be big enough for those signed copies to be collectors' items.</li>
<li>100$ for a signed copy with a personalized message!</li>
</ul>
<p>          If I do not receive all of my intended funds, I'll still distribute what I do receive to achieve the closest possible result to what I intend. No matter the results, CONTROL will move on, and Kairos Publishing will be making its debut. What I'm asking for is simply a little help in making my grand entrance into the industry.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How Far Can This Go?</h3>
<p>          As stated before, CONTROL: Ubiquity of Chaos is only the beginning of a series. Four more main series titles and three side titles are in planning, and the first sequel is already in the works. But, these books preface something even greater.</p>
<p>          From here, I fully intend to provide the services I perform for my own work for many other up-and-coming authors. A few are already lined up, spanning a few other genres. You can expect the next title to be a collection of high fantasy short stories by a fellow West Chester University student and aspiring high fantasy and science fantasy novelist. At Kairos Enterprises, we wont be turning authors down for not meeting a strict moral code or hidden agendas. Creative freedom will be maintained to the fullest, and no author will be turned away due to conflicting opinions. The creators will thrive here, and be encouraged to take their work beyond the literary and into other fields. There will be no arguments over rights here if you want to make a movie. We may even pitch in.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's In the Way?</h3>
<p>          The biggest thing in my way right now is funding and advertisement. I have the backing of several experienced and successful entrepreneurs, the book itself is already finished, and the reviews I have received are truly encouraging. As long as I can solve the issues with funding production and advertising my work, it should be relatively smooth sailing from here compared to being an English major at a university with papers due in every class and still managing to find time for my book.</p>
<p>          And those are the two places you are best suited to help. Your donations will cover the finances, and the advertising is even easier. Spread the word about this campaign, reblog it, post it to Facebook, on Reddit, or whatever group chats you may have on Skype or Discord. It's quick, it's simple, and it does just as much for me as your donations. Even if you can't donate, tell someone, and you've already helped enough for me to thank you from the bottom of my heart.<br/><br/>          Hopefully, with your help, CONTROL can one day be a household title, and Kairos Publishing may bring the works of many others to such a status as well.</p>
</div></div>","Who is the Author?
         My name is Drew Parsons, West Chester University student and an outspoken, strong-willed nerd.
          I've aspired to be an author of some sort since I was around twelve. I used to be obsessed with being hired by SEGA, and writing plots for my favorite game series. From there, I went on to become a fanfiction writer for five years, until at 18, when I decided to use my talents seriously. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the result of six years of effort into one series and the production of its first title.
 
What is CONTROL?

          CONTROL has been my passion project throughout my entire adult life thus far. A tale of a world rising from the shambles of a home-brewed apocalypse and discovering their place in reality. An introspection on the nature of what it means to be in control of anything, even yourself. A modern epic told through the eyes of everyday people forced to take up the mantle of modern gods. The beginning of all of this is wrapped into these pages.
          But of course, it cannot be completed without your help. The book is written, the cover art is made, but seeing as I'm privately publishing, I need printing funds, advertising funds, and to have my own website and online store constructed.
          Of course, if you'd like a sample of this completed book, then look no further. The first chapter is right here for you! (Mild profanity filter applied as per Indiegogo guidelines) 
          Lightning splits shimmering skies upon the horizon of a barren, war-scarred wasteland. Clouds reflect the hue of the bloodstained soil below, flowing between cracks of dry and lifeless desert. Gravel shifts and crunches beneath the feet of marching warriors. Bodies of countless inhuman gods lay scattered across the valley in beaten heaps, as the victors stand above them. Animalistic maws grin down to fallen defenders, fangs bared and tongues rolling out in sadistic glee as they take untold pleasure in conquering the supposedly mighty ‘heroes’ of the once great United States. At the center of them all stands one lone victor towering over his greatest foe to date, his face in the dirt.
            The horned titan stands above a fallen lion, his pride now broken as blood flows from between his fangs among gags. He grips a collection of broken ribs with a shattered hand covered in a crimson gauntlet, struggling to steady his erratic breath. The bull standing over him laughs. “You’ve fought well, but this country is ours now. The government was failing already, and their last failure was to entrust you with their safety.” With a right-handed thrust, the bull stabs his hefty blade into the dirt beside his fallen foe. The dim lights of sunset through reddened sand and stormclouds reflect off its blackened edge, showing the fallen a bloody reflection of his broken army. “Now I’ll give you one last chance. You treat your battalion like family. If you care for them so much, you’ll end your life here and now, with my sword.” A sadistic grin encompasses the bull’s face, his eyes beginning to project a gentle yet eerie gray. “Then, I’ll spare the rest and let them join me.”
            The lion on his knees before the hulking horned brute struggles to push himself upright, gripping the hilt of the sacrificial blade. His eyes remain hidden by the bangs of his mane, soaked in blood and weighed down from its usual flare. He grits his teeth, his ears ringing as the trauma to his head leaves all senses dulled. The world spins around him, clouding all sights and feeling. He can barely see his comrades on their knees and laid across the scorched earth as the tyrant’s thugs hold them down. And yet, he can still hear the cries of pain and defiance surrounding him. Fallen brothers, sisters, warriors whom he’d taken in out of not obligation of any sort, but trust and compassion. He could finally hear the shuffling of gravel beneath feet before him as his opponent turned to leave. The bull was certain of his victory, certain he had already won and taken the west for himself. All that would remain would be to march eastward and capture the defenseless masses awaiting their new ruler. How many other tyrants had the lion brought to their knees? How many other cities had he freed from the chaos of this new world? Was it all for naught now?
            A chuckle escapes the lion’s blood-stained lips. “Ya know… I’ve come a hell of a long way to just get to my death bed, haven’t I..?”
 
CONTROL
Ubiquity of Chaos
Chapter 1
Anarchy Reigns
          
            “Oy, boss.” A chiseled, grizzly man in his early twenties steps through a curtain of hanging chains into what he and his companions have come to call ‘the lounge’. His tired eyes scan across the deflated bean bags and flat tires that litter the floor and an overturned cooler sitting in the corner beside multiple emptied beer cases. All of this was then decorated by a slew of oil stains, spatters of blood, a stray tooth here and there, and the occasional remains of the boss’s latest binge. Sitting upon one of these many bean bags, stacked upon a tire, was what appeared to be a man quite a few years his junior, not even a legal adult yet by the looks of him. He wears a tattered and stained black tank top, matching the darkened oil spots of his faded jeans, the ankles shredded away into a fray of hair-like white thread halfway up his shins, just above the blood-stained leather boots upon his feet. His jet black mohawk stood tall and pointed at six peaks, a detail that would normally be distracting, if not for the menace within his swamp green eyes, split horizontally into twin pupils.            “What the hell is it now, Artie?” His voice is high-pitched, grating, yet rough and stern.            Artie stumbles as he catches the boss’s eyes, quickly turning away and looking back out through the doorway. He can’t help but stammer under his boss’s watchful gaze. “U-Uh, we’ve found someone at the door. Probably a new recruit, but he passed out just after we’d let ‘em in.” His frantic rambling trails off as turns back to face his boss. “W-What should we do about him, Cody?”            Cody raises an eyebrow for just a moment. It’s been quite a while since any of his subordinates, even old friends among them, called him by name. He pulls himself to his feet and steps past Artie with hands deep in his pockets. “Time to greet the newbie then. I’ve been looking forward to the next initiation…” A wide, toothy grin spreads across his face, teeth yellowed and jagged. Multiple heads turn as the heavy clicking of his boots upon the concrete floor echoes within the abandoned garage. Fools swinging from chains and drumming away at tin barrels suddenly go silent. A group of young drunks perched up on the empty lift fall eerily still from the midst of frantic laughter. As the undeniable alpha of their gang steps up, various animal traits and appendages twitch in anticipation. The occasional tail grows eerily still, feral eyes dilating as they take everything in. Claws unsheathe unconsciously as they wait to sink into anything upon an order. Disturbing clicks and buzzes echo throughout the garage.
            In the center of the room, a young man lays motionless on the floor, face shrouded by an overgrown mess of dark chocolate hair. His black jacket bore tears and holes revealing a red tee beneath, matching black cargo jeans and a pair of old, beaten sandals. A handful of cretins gathering around him dig into the many pockets of his coat, collecting batteries, an old handheld game system, some protein bars, and two old photos seemingly of their new victim with two friends in one and his family of four in the other.
              Cody snorts at the sight of him. “So, this is the little **** you dragged in, huh? He’s even younger than me…” He kicks the helpless young man in the ribs. “And got the hell kicked out of ‘im already. He’ll be useless to us. Probly just some beggar asking us to let up on the taxes.” He huffs and snaps his fingers. “Roll ‘im over, wanna get a look at this guy’s face. Might know the lil **** from somewhere.” Heeding their leader’s word, two burlier members of the group roll the new arrival onto his back, revealing a rather pasty complexion and a strong chin, barely covered in thin, sparse stubble.
            One of the women off to the side chuckles, playing with her greasy blonde hair. “This one’s just some clueless kid, kick him back to the streets boss.”
            Cody nods. “Yeah, get ‘im out. Got no use for anyone so weak.” Upon the boss’s command, the seemingly unconscious teen was heaved up by his arms, feet dragging across the concrete floor as the guards carry him back to the open garage door.
            Before the henchmen could get anywhere near the garage’s open front, a burst of crimson flame erupts from the limp captive between them, tossing the two aside in the blast. Before them now stands not a man, but a beast. His skin is hidden by a thick coat of deep brown fur marked with occasional darkened stripes, a shaggy mane across his head and framing his face. He’s held up by a pair of triple-jointed feral legs, black feline claws emerging from his toes. As the flames die down, he turns and glares into the eyes of their leader, swamp green meeting deep sapphire. “Not much for hospitality, are you? No wonder the whole town wants you dead.”
            The utterance of those words summoned down chaos. Bursts of colored flame and lightning consume the men and women scattered across the room, taking on equally if not more beastly forms, screams of rage erupting from their animalistic maws. The lion at the center of this storm of claws allows a wild grin to spread across his face. As they all take their time with delayed transformations, he kneels down to collect the photos they stole from him and dropped. Upon standing, he swings to his left and out of his upper left pocket, backhanding a man turned bipedal gecko in his face hard enough to send him barreling into one of his cohorts nearly fifteen feet away. As a set of feline claws swipe by his face, he falls onto his still outstretched left hand and swings an upwards heel kick into his assailant’s chest, sending them straight into the ceiling. As he feels an incoming burst of heat, he pedals off his hand and into the air over a wave of flames across the floor. Multiple others are caught in the attempted attack.
            Once on his feet, he launches a spin-kick into a young man’s shoulder, only to have his heel catch against their stone-covered hand. The target still skids a foot or so to his side, before a series of stones from the gravel scattered about gathers on his right forearm, forming a thick gauntlet to match the other. The feline hunter positions himself in a left-forward stance, allowing a collection of slow, stumbling blows to be thrown his way. He grows tired of it quickly and rushes past their last strike, grabbing his foe by the throat and using him as a living shield against a jet of flame unleashed from a nearby humanoid hawk’s bare hands. The meat shield screams out in pain for just a moment until he’s thrown into the pyro with enough force to generate the audible snap of breaking ribs.
            Silence falls for just a moment, until an unsightly humanoid insect with a deep tan carapace and sideways jaw dives down in an attempt of a sneak attack. His battle cry gives him away, resulting in a painful elbow to the cheekbone. They’re tossed aside through a collection of barrels and cans and barrels, causing gas and oil spill across the floor. And yet, the hunter’s azure eyes remain focused on swamp green, silence passing between the two for several moments.            “… Alright, not bad.” Cody begins to pace. “You’ve got power. A lot more than those chumps. So I guess I can let you join as second in command.”            The hunter snorts. “I’m not here to join, Cody. I’m here on behalf of the citizens of Spring City. The people you’ve been bleeding dry for weeks. Now, the next thing to bleed will be you.”
            The prey lets out a raspy, grim chuckle, gray flames forming around his feet. It flows in a motion akin to razors scraping past one another, sparking lightning along their edges. “You really think you can take me? News flash. I’m the strongest guy in this town, and probably for several around here. On top of that, I’ve already caught ya’ disarmed.” His eyes drift down to the space beneath the crimson hunter’s right elbow, to find nothing but a two inch stump already healed shut, unscarred and grown over with fresh fur. “Even if ya are a leftie, I’ve still got the upper hand, and one more than you.” With a sudden burst of silver fire, he emerges with rubbery, yet spike-covered gunmetal gray skin, his pupils still split sideways, and webs of skin between his fingers.
            The hunter raises an eyebrow. “Ah, a horned toad. That’s new.” He remarks as he shifts himself into a right-foot-forward stance, fist held up at hip level. “Stop yapping already and fight me, so I can get out of here.”
            That did it. The punk’s lips and brow curl into an almost painful scowl, his limbs twitching spastically. He backflips into the wall and plants his feet upon it, before kicking off and launching himself at inhuman speed. A thick layer of spikes and blades of hardened skin form along his right arm and grow outwards into a jagged two foot mass past his hand, swinging in to shred the hunter.
            Hair hangs down from the lion’s mane and casts a shadow over his eyes as he pivots to in on his right foot. He swings in his left fist at speeds the toad’s mutant eyes couldn’t track. Before Cody can register what had happened, he finds himself kneeling on the floor behind the lion, holding a broken arm. The man who broke it begins walking away with a bleeding, but visibly healing hand hanging at his side. He speaks with his back turned. “You made a lot of mistakes, Cody. First was killing the local police and taking over this town.” Cody looks up with a bloodshot glare, a constant twitch in the fingers of his functioning arm. “Next was sucking this town dry and taking everything they had to sate your own craving for power and attention.” As he walks away, back turned to the furious toad, his form is consumed in another crimson burst, returning to a human state. “Third was taking me in.” He can hear electricity sparking among the extended spikes upon his target’s back and between his horns. He ignores this and takes a moment to pick up his discarded jacket and pull it back on. “Fourth was calling me a worthless kid. I’m seventeen, damnit. And last…”
            As the young hunter steps through the door, he hears the deep sigh of a flame’s ignition, and almost immediately after, feels the gust of an explosion blowing past him. Debris and smoke follow in its wake, careening over his shoulder. Small smoldering scraps bounce off his back. “Using electricity in a room full of spilled oil and gas.”
            An exasperated breath escapes the victor’s lips and he runs his remaining hand through his overgrown hair. The gravel driveway crunches beneath his feet as flames lick at his heels and scorch the stone. “That was uneventful. Just another group of punks with big heads.” He steps out onto the side of the road and starts walking along Route 724 headed south, allowing his mind to wander over the past few months, contemplating the chaos that had consumed the world. It’s funny how one day can bring all civilization to its knees, and all thanks to its own people.  
            June 12th 2013. It had been a completely ordinary day, and yet, in an instant, all that had once been considered normal was left behind in a brilliant flash of multicolored lights across the skies. Within seconds, the heavens grew dark and foreboding as lightning tore through the air, and gale force winds rocked wilderness and city alike. Flowing lights, like color changing fire, flooded from holes in the clouds and sunk into all it could reach. Since then, names for this event have been tossed around by theorists and information brokers. Nowadays, most people call it The Breach, in lieu of any more apocalyptically inspired names.
            The moment the sky opened up, people around the world were changed. Their bones were reshaped, shrinking and growing on their own accord, as their skin and internal organs shifted to match. New limbs were grown, skin replaced with insectoid exoskeletons or scales, or covered in thick fur. Their bodies became both human and beast in one, with the advantages and talents of these creatures on a human scale, and yet, improved further. A grand step in evolution, yet no person affected was alike. Within moments of taking on these forms the many whom had fallen victim to the transformation began to instinctively trigger new abilities, powers that were far from biological.
            Most found they were faster and stronger. Others would find themselves able to control the elements or spit poisons. Equally vast were those whose powers were obscure and difficult to label. One occasion that stuck out in the wandering young man’s head was meeting a boy who could perfectly adhere himself to anything… and nothing else. Kind of a useless power, really.
            The results of these changes were almost immediate. As random civilians around the world discovered their superhuman abilities, they were put to use for fulfilling their formerly impossible desires. They felt unstoppable, and in many ways, were. Institutions and prisons burned to the ground, inmates escaped, students left without futures, businesses left unattended. Psychotic individuals now lacking any form of restriction took to the streets in mass, and with their march, society fell.
            This new way of life has become the norm in the three months since. Scavenge for food, avoid any mutants you see passing by - beings that had been since dubbed ‘Unleashed’- and hope your home remained your own. If you weren’t among those following this pattern, you were one of the many taking advantage of this world of anarchy, displaying your newfound power in order to make a living.
            The road ahead is a testament to the decay of civilization. Abandoned cars litter the streets, strewn about at odd angles. Some are crashed into one another or abandoned in ditches. A few are embedded into the guardrails. Occasionally, dried blood can be found in the seats and windshields. The bodies didn’t last long. A five foot tall buzzard atop one of the vehicles could attest to that. It ignores the vagabond with the soul of a lion as he passes. It knows better than to attack an Unleashed.
            Hours into his trek, he ventures into the borders of Phoenixville, cringing upon the sight of these all too familiar streets. Sidewalks crumbled, the graveyard to his right now in shambles, and the pizza parlor was reduced to rubble. “Damnit. Really liked their calzones.” An echoing car alarm blares in the distance, only for the battery to die out within seconds, allowing silence to overcome the urban terrain once more. His tired eyes pan to the shattered windows and broken doors, until resting upon the sight of an intact door, surrounded by boarded windows upon a backdrop of faded brick. It was the right half of one of the many duplexes lining this old street. Most of the surrounding buildings appear nearly untouched, almost like the apocalypse never happened. He ventures up to the door and kicks a few pieces of debris, scraps of metal from who knows where to fallen roof tiles. The sounds echo through the otherwise silent streets.
            By the time he reaches the door, he finds it already cracked open. A husky voice addresses him from behind it. “Alright, the hell are you doin here? Be careful with your words. I’m in no mood to deal with any threats.”
            A faint chuckle escapes the vagabond’s lips, leaning against the doorway with his left hand. “You seriously gonna greet an old friend like that, Mason?”
            Silence falls for just a moment until the door’s thrown open to reveal a tall, gangly teen with vibrant white crew-cut hair. Not even as yellowed as platinum blonde, but albino white, contrasting his earthy eyes as they fell upon his visitor. “Scott? The hell are you doing here? I thought you were dead!” He leans in the doorway and sizes up his old friend, his gaze lingering on Scott’s right side for a moment.
            Scott raises his arms in a nearly comical shrug, leaving his right sleeve to hang off his stumped elbow. “Thought I was too for a while. You gonna invite me in, or is that thick head stuck in the doorway?”
            With a roll of his eyes, Mason steps away and holds the door, letting Scott pass through, and leading to a few sighs of relief throughout the living room. His mother wearily lifts herself from her seat and wraps her scrawny arms around Scott in a tight embrace. Her own hair’s grayed quite a bit since they last met, the stress of these past few months having aged her by decades. Despite the constant sagging in her tired face, her smile is as inviting as ever. “Oh thank God you’re alive. When I heard about the massacre out there, I thought-”            “Please, I’m fine, you don’t need to worry!” Scott slowly pries himself from her arms and removes his jacket, seeming rather practiced in functioning without a right hand as he tosses his jacket across the room and onto the coat rack by the door with his stumped elbow. Despite the faintly grim reactions of his peers, he saunters across the unpolished hardwood floor over to a nearby chair and drops into place. The dimly lit home soothes him for a few moments as he takes in the familiar scents of cinnamon and wet wood that constantly permeate this house. In spite of that, he only allows that peace and silence to remain for a few moments before getting to all the questions on everyone’s minds. “So were you all here at home when it went down?”
            Mason nods as he leans back against the wall. “Yeah… My parents and I were the only ones awake when The Breach hit. Father was out drinking.” He crosses his arms and closes his eyes, drifting into memories. “He didn’t like seeing me when he got home. Or Sadie…” He peeks across the room to his youngest sister, curled up on the couch with petite horns poking out of her hair. “Started ranting about us being demons.” He casts his gaze back to Scott. “…Had no choice in the end. He’s buried out back.”
            Scott hunches over and grunts, staring off into empty space. Mr. Bowers’ bigotry was no news to him. “So… How far into hell has this town fallen?”
            They look amongst each other for a moment before Mrs. Bowers looks to Mason with prying eyes. He sighs and paces about the room, roughly rubbing at the back of his neck as the stained floorboards creak beneath him. “Well, it was pretty far at first. People started changing, and half the town started burning. The high school was blown up a few minutes in. Apparently someone with combustion powers put in a little too much effort. Within a few days, things settled down enough for people to hide in their own homes, if they still had ‘em.” He leans against the wall with crossed arms, letting a quick flare of black and white flames surround him for a moment. “I happened to keep this place intact.”
            “Well, that explains the white hair.” Scott shrugs. “Seen weirder shit out of Unleashed before…” Scott leans forward and props himself up with an elbow on the left armrest to his chair. “Pretty sure last week I saw a guy with antennae in his dormant form.”
            Mason groans and lowers his head. “Yeah, well, it’s not as bad as Richie.” Scott’s brow furled at the mention of that name, mumbling ‘Richie Anderson’ to himself. “The dick’s been ‘roided out since The Breach and made a new home out of the bank. Rumor has it when he took over he tore the vault door off with his bare hands and flattened someone with it. But…”            Scott knew the look on his face. That smirk spoke of rebellion. The last time he’d seen it was in the process of unleashing what had to be the best senior prank he’d ever seen, consisting of a homemade mix tape, an agent in the staff, and a misplaced key.
            Mason begins to pace. “There’s a team comin’ together. People from across the state have started gathering here, one of ‘em was even a big player in Paoli’s home team when the first raiding parties arrived. So far, they’re gathered up in a base we set up across town. Well-hidden and kind of out of the way for most survivors here. As long as we approach quietly and watch our backs, we’ll be safe from any raids.”
            Silence falls throughout the room as all eyes fall upon Scott, his own gaze falling upon something imperceptible, glazed yet focused. “Alright then...” He turns to face Mason with stone-faced determination. His limbs are loose and relaxed, yet the steel in his back and fire in his eyes speaks volumes. “Where do I sign up?”
            Mason grins from ear to ear, stepping up and taking Scott’s hand with a renewed passion and lifting him from his seat. “We’ll have to go after sunset, make sure we stay hidden. After midnight would probably be best. So, go crash up in my room for a while, and I’ll come grab ya later.” He pats Scott’s back and sends him off towards the stairs, as Scott gives him a casual two-fingered salute.
            “Thanks. Could use a rest after dealin’ with… I think was about fifteen dipshits runnin’ a gang out of a garage a town over.” Scott snorts as he marches up the creaky steps. “Over half of em bailed in the middle of the fight to save their own asses.” He yawns and trails off upon stepping into a room full of old games and consoles that no longer worked thanks to the lack of electricity. Some ornate weapons hang on the walls, most too dull to be of any use in cutting and all likely too fragile to be of any worth in combat. Chuckling to himself, he kicks off his sandals and collapses into the bed, staring at the ceiling in silence for several minutes. He hears the Bowers chattering amongst themselves below, but having finally found a peaceful place to rest, he drifts off into the deepest sleep he’s had in months.
          ...And thus begins the tale of Scott's biggest mistake and how it eventually both saves and dooms the world. 
 
What is Kairos Publishing?

          My dream for a brighter future in publishing. The current industry is rife with corruption and limits the creative rights of its customers, the authors. What I intend to do is remedy that with a publishing company by authors and for authors. I'll already be making plenty off my own work. Why should I need to take so much income from another author's work? Why make millions off of what isn't mine? I see no need, and I intend to return that income to the authors. A humbler company for a fairer industry.
 

What Do I Need and Why?
          So, here's where your funding comes in.
          I'll need enough to produce a few thousand copies of the physical book for the first wave of sales. My most hopeful but unlikely goal is around ten thousand, hence the fifty thousand goal. Sadly, fifty thousand will not be enough after taxes and other expenses, but it's a good start.          Then comes the costs of producing, hosting, and maintaining a website. This site will, at its core, be for Kairos Publishing, but will include pages specifically for CONTROL and an online store selling the CONTROL book series and other upcoming publications and products. (More on other products later)          Other lesser expenses will also include an improved office space for managing this endeavor and producing later titles, as my current hardware is wearing is a bit thin.
 
What do I get Out of This?
          Donators will be able to recieve the following prizes for their generous donations!

7$ for a pre-ordered copy of the ebook, to be recieved by email. This will be a 3rd party file rather than a Kindle file, but it will be functional on a Kindle device.
9$ for a pre-release copy of the ebook, two weeks before the official sale date!
16$ for a pre-ordered copy of the printed novel in paperback.
20$ for a signed copy! With your help, this series may one day be big enough for those signed copies to be collectors' items.
100$ for a signed copy with a personalized message!

          If I do not receive all of my intended funds, I'll still distribute what I do receive to achieve the closest possible result to what I intend. No matter the results, CONTROL will move on, and Kairos Publishing will be making its debut. What I'm asking for is simply a little help in making my grand entrance into the industry.
 

How Far Can This Go?
          As stated before, CONTROL: Ubiquity of Chaos is only the beginning of a series. Four more main series titles and three side titles are in planning, and the first sequel is already in the works. But, these books preface something even greater.
          From here, I fully intend to provide the services I perform for my own work for many other up-and-coming authors. A few are already lined up, spanning a few other genres. You can expect the next title to be a collection of high fantasy short stories by a fellow West Chester University student and aspiring high fantasy and science fantasy novelist. At Kairos Enterprises, we wont be turning authors down for not meeting a strict moral code or hidden agendas. Creative freedom will be maintained to the fullest, and no author will be turned away due to conflicting opinions. The creators will thrive here, and be encouraged to take their work beyond the literary and into other fields. There will be no arguments over rights here if you want to make a movie. We may even pitch in.
 

What's In the Way?
          The biggest thing in my way right now is funding and advertisement. I have the backing of several experienced and successful entrepreneurs, the book itself is already finished, and the reviews I have received are truly encouraging. As long as I can solve the issues with funding production and advertising my work, it should be relatively smooth sailing from here compared to being an English major at a university with papers due in every class and still managing to find time for my book.
          And those are the two places you are best suited to help. Your donations will cover the finances, and the advertising is even easier. Spread the word about this campaign, reblog it, post it to Facebook, on Reddit, or whatever group chats you may have on Skype or Discord. It's quick, it's simple, and it does just as much for me as your donations. Even if you can't donate, tell someone, and you've already helped enough for me to thank you from the bottom of my heart.          Hopefully, with your help, CONTROL can one day be a household title, and Kairos Publishing may bring the works of many others to such a status as well.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>Hello you, my name is Jason and yes, I was that young man. This book is a journal of sorts; my journey from waking up in the Singapore General Hospital, through the extended,  recovery process and finally, literally getting back up on my own two feet to start life anew. In that process, I learned many a thing or two I share throughout the story I hope you can glean from my experience. </p>
<p>This certainly must have been a life-altering experience you say? Having been found tagged with a ""death certificate"", being bed and wheelchair bound for 5 months and having visible, unsightly scars from the skin grafting done over the 3rd degree burns you sustained, surely life must be so different for me now?</p>
<p>Well, dear reader, even as I put on a shirt with my own two hands today, write these words with my own voice and mind -- I will admit I still take things for granted from time to time, even when I know I was moments away from losing everything. But that's the beauty of being human isn't. Therein lies the message of this book; we always, always have a choice.</p>
<p>After all, do you need a death certificate before you decide to live? So I hope you choose wisely dear reader, to live in Gratitude, Purpose, and Hope.</p>

<p><strong>#YOLT MOVEMENT</strong></p>
<p>The youth of today are known as the most <strong>disengaged </strong>and<strong> apathetic generations</strong> yet, despite this being an incredible time of technological advancements that makes our lives easier, communications that connect and creates opportunities across the world more than ever. This could be the result of the single fact that most youth, perhaps even adults often choose to be blind to – that we are mortal. This may lead to our <strong>taking life for granted</strong>; putting important things off and settling for less than what would make us feel truly alive. It could be that some of us may want to do big things, but <strong>dare not dream</strong> or think that we are “<strong>not good enough</strong>”.</p>
<p>As a result, youth may realize that are going down a slippery slope of the default narrative of society, to ""do things they do not enjoy, to impress people they do not respect, to get things they do not like"". When will they realise that it is a waste of their precious momentary, vulnerable lives - when it is too late? We believe that our youth need to know how to find that one thing, to overcome their darkest nights and fight for a brighter future; <strong>hope</strong>.</p>
<p>As a YOLT patron, your contribution will also support The YOLT Movement, which is a year-long project which involves speaking at various secondary and tertiary level schools, to inspire and encourage these youth to live a life in Gratitude, Purpose, and Hope. </p>

Hello you, my name is Jason and yes, I was that young man. This book is a journal of sorts; my journey from waking up in the Singapore General Hospital, through the extended,  recovery process and finally, literally getting back up on my own two feet to start life anew. In that process, I learned many a thing or two I share throughout the story I hope you can glean from my experience. 
This certainly must have been a life-altering experience you say? Having been found tagged with a ""death certificate"", being bed and wheelchair bound for 5 months and having visible, unsightly scars from the skin grafting done over the 3rd degree burns you sustained, surely life must be so different for me now?
Well, dear reader, even as I put on a shirt with my own two hands today, write these words with my own voice and mind -- I will admit I still take things for granted from time to time, even when I know I was moments away from losing everything. But that's the beauty of being human isn't. Therein lies the message of this book; we always, always have a choice.
After all, do you need a death certificate before you decide to live? So I hope you choose wisely dear reader, to live in Gratitude, Purpose, and Hope.

Outline  Chapter 1 : GenesisThe beginning. I open the book with my background growing up and the start of my Cambodian adventure in the Phom Penh airport.Chapter 2 : 3 x 2 = 6 Degrees of SeparationHow I was eventually found after 10 days of zero contact. The interesting thing was, my hero, Israel, was contacted on the same day by two individuals asking him to look for me! Thank you Mark Zuckerberg!Chapter 3 : It only takes a sparkHere I go into the crazy details of the episode, how it started and came to an exploding conclusion; told by one of the two actual eye-witnesses that night.Chapter 4 : In-between worldsHalf of me is found! My mind, that is.Chapter 5 : AirborneWe take flight via a miraculous emergency evacuation to get back to better medical facilities.Chapter 6 : FightThis chapter is extracted from Mom's log book of the very rough initial recovery process, the details of the exact conditions and damage.Chapter 7 : HomeboundComing home takes on a new meaning.Chapter 8 : Samulah!Roughly translated to ""Do it again!"", I talk about the emotions and process of getting back up on my feet, and back to the wheelchair again, upon completing my second surgery.Chapter 9 : JASONYOLTThe birth of this project, so I can live out my second chance at life in purpose, gratitude, and hope; my biggest lessons from this experience.Chapter 10 : YouI'd really like to not make this book just about me, and in this chapter, I detail several exercises you may carry out, so you learn the things I did, so that you, dear reader, can YOLT without a death certificate. ;)Audience  The intended readers of 'If YOLT' was initially for individuals going through a tough time in their lives, especially trauma patients recuperating in hospitals from major accidents. The explicit details articulated were intended to help those individuals relate to the story and for them to ultimately know, that they are not alone.As the story progressed and I started sharing my story with others, including active, healthy individuals, I remembered that everyone is fighting their own battles, everyone has their own dark times too; that everyone could use a little gratitude, purpose, and hope.If you are looking for a little inspiration, a reminder that life is short, yet so beautiful if lived to the full, or you are looking to gift this to someone who could use it, this is the book for you.

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>I am raising money to fund the second edition of my book, The JOBS Act: Crowdfunding for Small Businesses and Startups. Published by Apress in paperback on October 2, 2012, mine was the first JOBS Act crowdfunding book published. Now it's time for an update. Apress will publish the second edition in October, 2016, as soon as I finish writing it. This is where you come in....</p>
<p>A lot has happened since the first book was published, and I intend to provide a through update.  I will create a series of blogs and websites with infographics, videos, Title III campaigns and other material. We will have the most complete and comprehensive information on the subject. </p>
<p>In addition to writing the first book on the JOBS Act and crowdfunding, I am one of the people who helped crowdfunding get started. My background is in finance (MBA) and economics (MA), both from the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>This campaign will insure that I can finish the second edition in the time allotted, in a complete and comprehensive manner. I will use several new techniques to write the book quickly.  The book will be published in October, 2016. That's three months.</p>

<p>By helping this book get published, you will insure that objective, honest information on crowdfunding comes from an independent, unaffiliated source. This is important since we are already seeing biased, inaccurate information on crowdfunding being promoted by greedy, unscrupulous lawyers and others. (On June 17, 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit recognized me as a ""Friend of the Court"" in an action that state securities regulators brought to try to slow down crowdfunding. My comments helped convince the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow crowdfunding sooner rather than later.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">In the meantime, I need money to complete the book. I will have to pay a number of expenses, from cell phone bills, to copies of research documents (yes, some people still actually use paper hard copies...) to expenses related to the creation of specilized graphics, to data on small business financing and crowdfunding. And, of course, McDonald's (gotta eat...)</span></p>

THE AUTHOR</b></p>
<p>My name is Luka also
known as Luksina the Dragon, I come from Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, and I have
been writing fantasy fiction since I was 12 years old. Later, I went into the
waters of writing erotic furry fantasy fiction, specializing in dragons, where
I even managed to gain a humble following from the furry community. I
successfully thrived despite the repression I received from my culturally
degraded society, friends, and even my very own patriarchal parents. My
creative will was not to be bound to the backward patriarchal society I live
in! Still...they are people too, just like me and you, therefore, it is my duty
and I hope your's too, to help them accept the freedom which every person
deserves.</p>

<p><b>ABOUT
THE BOOK</b></p>
<p><b><i>""The Naughty and Nice Sides of Dragons""</i></b>  is a conceptual
illustrated collection of short stories about dragons and their adventures,
some of which are erotic and some that are not. The genre is fantasy fiction
with a touch of furry erotica. The entire book is filled with the original illustrations
made by my fellow furry artists, whose contact info are linked below in the
text.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469747408/4_s5oxth.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Illustration by Puffy</i></p>
<p>The plots are ranging
from a young dragon seducing an elf princess to a pregnant dragon being saved
by a human family.  As you may have guessed these topics are controversial
in my country and as such, the mainstream publishers are not interested in
promoting this liberal book of mine. That's why I will need you to join me in
my battle against closed-minded conventions of my homeland.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469747486/2_p2dbyv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b>FUNDING </b></p>
<p><b>How The Funds Will Be Used</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Printing: I need at least $500 for humble publishing of my book (for
the initial printing; any subsequent printing will be funded with the profits
from the sales of the book)</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Marketing: The price I asked for is the bare minimum that is
needed for printing, but the most important thing to me is that liberal ideas, which
I expressed in my book, reach the wider audience of my anguished homeland.
Therefore, marketing is the key factor in this humane and creative cause of you
and me, and that’s why every extra penny that crosses the goal is equally
important to me. In case we breach the main goal, I would put all the
additional money into the promotion of the book and the spreading of ideas and
values of freedom, peace and tolerance. (approximate price of various
promotions over the native TV and radio stations, as well as the local
newspaper, etc.)</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>If you want to aid me,
but you happen to be short on money, I completely understand you. Not all of us
are in a position to donate, but hopefully, you could tell your friends or
share my project on your social media accounts which I would very much
appreciate.</p>
<p><b>FAQ</b></p>
<p>1.<span>  </span>Why don't you publish
your book in USA and worldwide?</p>
<p> - Because the
main goal of my project is to spread the furry culture and democratic values in
my undeveloped country.</p>
<p> 
2.  Why don't you run a local campaign?</p>
<p> - Because the
people of my country are not economically nor culturally able to support me,
and so I must turn to you, my foreign friends :)</p>
<p> 
3.  Why print the book? Why not just publish it online?</p>
<p> - The reason I
intend to publish a hard copy of my book is solely because internet isn't
nearly as widespread here as it is in more developed countries, therefore my
book in the printed form would reach a larger audience.</p>
<p> 
4.  Why didn't you put a physical copy of the book as one of the
rewards?</p>
<p> - Because I am
ashamed to ask of you for the amount of money it would cost to ship a physical
copy of the book. The postal service of my country is outdated and expensive.</p>

been writing fantasy fiction since I was 12 years old. Later, I went into the
waters of writing erotic furry fantasy fiction, specializing in dragons, where
I even managed to gain a humble following from the furry community. I
successfully thrived despite the repression I received from my culturally
degraded society, friends, and even my very own patriarchal parents. My
creative will was not to be bound to the backward patriarchal society I live
in! Still...they are people too, just like me and you, therefore, it is my duty
and I hope your's too, to help them accept the freedom which every person
deserves.

ABOUT
THE BOOK
""The Naughty and Nice Sides of Dragons""  is a conceptual
illustrated collection of short stories about dragons and their adventures,
some of which are erotic and some that are not. The genre is fantasy fiction
with a touch of furry erotica. The entire book is filled with the original illustrations
made by my fellow furry artists, whose contact info are linked below in the
text.
Illustration by Puffy
The plots are ranging
from a young dragon seducing an elf princess to a pregnant dragon being saved
by a human family.  As you may have guessed these topics are controversial
in my country and as such, the mainstream publishers are not interested in
promoting this liberal book of mine. That's why I will need you to join me in
my battle against closed-minded conventions of my homeland.

FUNDING 
How The Funds Will Be Used
· 
Printing: I need at least $500 for humble publishing of my book (for
the initial printing; any subsequent printing will be funded with the profits
from the sales of the book)
· 
Marketing: The price I asked for is the bare minimum that is
needed for printing, but the most important thing to me is that liberal ideas, which
I expressed in my book, reach the wider audience of my anguished homeland.
Therefore, marketing is the key factor in this humane and creative cause of you
and me, and that’s why every extra penny that crosses the goal is equally
important to me. In case we breach the main goal, I would put all the
additional money into the promotion of the book and the spreading of ideas and
values of freedom, peace and tolerance. (approximate price of various
promotions over the native TV and radio stations, as well as the local
newspaper, etc.)

Other
Ways You Can Help
If you want to aid me,
but you happen to be short on money, I completely understand you. Not all of us
are in a position to donate, but hopefully, you could tell your friends or
share my project on your social media accounts which I would very much
appreciate.
FAQ
1.  Why don't you publish
your book in USA and worldwide?
 - Because the
main goal of my project is to spread the furry culture and democratic values in
my undeveloped country.
 
2.  Why don't you run a local campaign?
 - Because the
people of my country are not economically nor culturally able to support me,
and so I must turn to you, my foreign friends :)
 
3.  Why print the book? Why not just publish it online?
 - The reason I
intend to publish a hard copy of my book is solely because internet isn't
nearly as widespread here as it is in more developed countries, therefore my
book in the printed form would reach a larger audience.
 
4.  Why didn't you put a physical copy of the book as one of the
rewards?
 - Because I am
ashamed to ask of you for the amount of money it would cost to ship a physical
copy of the book. The postal service of my country is outdated and expensive.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>I'm asking for $30,000 USD.  This amount includes the cost to edit and publish my book, <i>Unmasking</i> (in the various Ebook formats, Paperback, Audiobook, and Hard Copy), as well as for a website, training, education and the ability to attend and speak at relevant Tradeshows/Conventions.</li>
<li>I'm Canadian, so $30,000 will translate to roughly $40,000, however, selling books isn't a lucrative thing. Here's an example of a breakdown of what I'll actually receive from this crowdfund:<ul><li>$20 USD for a paperback book - $5 USD to the printer, - 11% to Indiegogo (who include the shipping charges in the crowdfund amount, so $28 USD) = $12, - 10% to the not-for-profit = $10.80 USD towards the crowdfund. </li></ul>
</li>
<li>I'm self-publishing because I don't want the majority (as in 90%) of the profits from the book going to a big book publisher, and I don't want a big book publisher having the right to edit out important parts of the book.</li>
<li>The big book publisher also chooses the printer, and I'd have no control over what a person would have to pay to get the book.  As it sits now, I have great rates for both printing and shipping the book to most places in the world.</li>
<li>I've already received three professional reviews and I'm confident the value the book delivers will exceed expectations. One more professional review is expected by April 15, 2017.  ​To read the full reviews I've received so far, please go to <a href=""http://www.RayneDowell.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.RayneDowell.com</a>.</li>
<li>Here's some reviews I've received so far:</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;"">""An inherently fascinating, exceptionally candid, consistently compelling, thoughtful and thought-provoking memoir, ""Unmasking: A Journey"" is deeply personal and ultimately inspiring."" - <i>MIDWEST BOOK REVIEW</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;"">""Beautiful and scary and ungainly and soaring and everything else that goes into a meaningful life."" - <i>BURT KEMPNER,INDEPENDENT WRITER/PRODUCER</i></p>

<ul>
<li>I have the passion, but I know I'll need some public speaking training because I want to deliver the truths of ""Unmasking"" in the most understandable, straight-forward way. </li>

<li>Your contribution will not only help you, if you decide you'd like to transform your life by <i>Unmasking and Unchaining into a Unparalleled, Superpowered, Unstoppable You! </i>but if you're good to go, you probably know someone who can benefit from this book.</li>

</ul>
<p><i>​</i></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>I'm a first time Author, so this is new to me. It's challenging to find the best pricing and quality from printers and learn how to do the majority of the work myself, like;<ul>
<li>how to format and upload an Ebook, and where to upload it,</li>
<li>how to format a Hard Copy book for the printer, and get the best price for the reader,</li>
<li>how to narrate, record and upload the Audiobook, </li>
<li>how to format the Paperback and get the best price for the reader.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The thing is, I don't quit, and I won't stop. This book <i><strong>will</strong></i>  be published - one way or another. Because I'm that dedicated to sharing the important messages in the book. Besides the thousands of experiments I've conducted, I've also dedicated the last year to writing, editing and researching how to publish a book.</li>
<li>I've surrounded myself with a dedicated team of amazing supporters who want to see this book reach the world and the word ""grateful"" simply doesn't describe how I feel about all the support I've received so far and continue to receive. </li>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>How it<strong> <i>really</i></strong> works, not how I've been <strong>told</strong> it works. </p>
<p>Much of what I've learned has a lot to do with how our emotions affect us. These are the emotions I see negatively impacting people's lives daily, the same emotions that used to impact me negatively, robbing me of the life I was meant to live:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anxiety</li>
<li>Anger</li>
<li>Overwhelm</li>
<li>Feeling Stuck</li>

<p>My campaign is about raising funds to edit, publish and get the word out about the solutions I've  discovered, solutions that will help you!</p>
<p>The book, <i>Unmasking</i>, provides<strong> superpowered, emotionally intelligent solutions for people with emotional pain, helping them dissolve it, so they can free themselves and begin living a life of purpose, peace and happiness by using the lessons and solutions inside.</strong></p>
<p>This is important to me because showing people how they can access their own positive energy, to transform and improve their lives, means... <i>we all win</i>. </p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding how we can positively impact our own and others lives means increasing what I call the ""thrive"" factor in our personal lives - which positively affects our families, our communities and our environment. </li>
<li>This is a win-win-win, because a portion of the proceeds for this crowdfund and the ongoing book sales will be going to The Doorway, <a href=""http://www.TheDoorway.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.TheDoorway.ca</a>, a local not-for-profit I support.</li>

Greater sales means turning enough profit to give us the ability to give Wings to all our new books, which, in return, gets us closer to receiving equality in the publishing world.We are now preparing our books for 2017 and need an extra boost to our budget to ensure all our books receive equal advertising, reviews, and awards. Like any parent, we hate to be forced to pick favorites among all our equally gifted children so we offer all our titles as perks. You can read about each of our titles at Bedazzled Ink Publishing.Thank you for becoming a Book Angel and helping woman authors to break through the publishing glass ceiling.",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>My boy sounds so authoritative. Whenever he says ‘this is how it
is’, I hold my breathe. A lifetime of attention to discover how it
is that things are what they are, and I’m still not sure. Maybe he
knows.</p>
<p>“Yeah, so, the horses they poop in bags that are stuck to their
butts. Did you know that, dad?”</p>
<p>The mysteries of manure. Hmmm, where’s the metaphor?</p>
<p>“So like it won’t be that gross, because like we’re spending
the whole day with our horses. Yeah, this is how it is…”</p>
<p>Here it  comes… the universe explained.</p>
<p>“There’s going to be thousands of horses.”</p>
<p>“Thousands?”</p>
<p>“No,no, no hundreds, or maybe like a dozen or more.”</p>
<p>I just hope it won’t be a few tired nags.</p>
<p>“Yeah, so we choose our horse and we spend all day with him.
Imagine how cool, dad. I, uhm, feed him and brush him and then I
riiiiiiiiddddeeee. Hee-haw, giddyup….I wonder what his name is
going to be?”</p>
<p>We’re walking to his school for an activity day at a horse farm
outside the city. The expedition leaves real early. It’s 7h15.
Normally, at this time, I’m searching for clean underwear…so I’m
even less awake than usual. But it’s prime time for Noah.</p>
<p>“If only his name was Fire. I could say <em>Go Fire Go</em>.
That would be awesome!”</p>
<p>He gallops ahead a few feet, then gallops back.</p>
<p>“Dad, you know that I’m a horse like that’s my Chinese
symbol. Yeah, and the best of all is that I’m a Fire Horse, yeah,
because you can be fire or water in Chinese symbols. Cool huhn. I
love horses, they’re my favorite real animals. Dad, would you
prefer being fire or water?”</p>
<p>“Depends on what exactly that means. Each has its properties, so
I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Doubt, I think, is a function of age. Or having been
bitch-slapped.</p>
<p>“I’m happy I’m Fire…it’s way cooler.”</p>
<p>“Or hotter.”</p>
<p>Wow, a whole mess of neurons fired on that one.</p>
<p>“Good one dad. What’s your Chinese symbol?”</p>
<p>“Rooster.”</p>
<p>“Hah, that sucks! And if you’re a water rooster it’s even
worse. Imagine, a rooster in water.”</p>
<p>A wet bird. Sounds good to me.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Noah, but my Western sign is Aquarius, the best sign…it’s
the age of Aquarius, Aquarius, Aquariuuuuuusssss.”</p>
<p>I’ve been singing that since primary school…still waiting for
the coming of that bloody age that is supposed to be mine.</p>
<p>“Awkwardddddd.” Noah’s new fashionable word for dismissing
the ‘uncool’.</p>
<p>“I’m a Sagittarius, right dad? Yeah, it’s cool because he’s
a centaur and a centaur is half horse, half man, so it all makes
sense… you see? I’m a Fire horse and a Centaur and I love horses
best of all.”</p>
<p>A Centaur is like a horse’s ass with an asshole’s head. I
wouldn’t be that proud.</p>
<p>“Dad, what does an Aquarius do?”</p>
<p>“He’s the water-bearer.”</p>
<p>“Awkwaaaarrrd.”</p>
<p>“You know, oh arrogant little horse-butt, Aquarians are free,

<p>“But dad, how is that possible? Like, I thought <em>you</em>
were an Aquarius.”</p>
<p>“I am…oh you little gas factory, you got me. Good one.”</p>
<p>“Haha…I’m on f<em>iiiiiii</em>rree. Like you couldn’t be
an Aquarius because of what you said Aquarius was. Funny huhn?”</p>
<p>Kill it by explaining it.</p>

That printer was called the RepRap Libro, which was then developed further into the Ready RepRap. This book was to be completed through a crowdfunding campaign launched on Indiegogo in 2017. Though the campaign was not a success, I finished the book anyway and opted to simply release it and all related assets into the open source. Please feel free to download, build, share, sell, or modify the Ready RepRap! It is a great 3D robotic platform. It can be easily scaled up or down, and provides a great starting place for all kinds of larger format 3D printing or CNC work.

<h3><span style=""line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;""><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">I don't like reading boring books. And I would certainly take no pleasure in boring you. </span><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;"">I once read a book about calcium(!) that was so dull, that it put me to sleep in one minute flat, which worked out great, because it saved me from a bad case of jet-lag. I would not recommend that book to my worst enemy.</span></span></h3>
<p><b>I am also <i>not </i>a health nut. Ice cream is and has always been my favorite food. </b>I'm just a truth-seeker, and I don't like being duped. For the last 15 years, nearly every person I have encountered, has asked me the <i>exact </i>same question: <strong>""How did you get into the field of Chinese medicine?""</strong> Which may translate:  Why would you venture so far off the beaten path? No accountants or actuaries are asked this question. </p>
<p>There's another question people ask me. It usually follows directly after the one above: <strong>""Do you <i>believe </i>in Chinese Medicine?""</strong>  I will answer both of these questions for you now, because these questions are the reason I started writing what ultimately became this book. </p>
<p>The reason I chose to study Chinese Medicine was because I have long sensed that modern medicine was fumbling in the dark in too many areas. There were simply too many unanswered questions, too many contradictions. This lit a fire under me to find the truth about what really causes disease, and what cures it.</p>
<p>It was my interest in truth that led me to study Chinese Medicine. The fact that Chinese Medicine offers a fairly ascetic and regimented approach to health was not the main attraction for me. It was more of a minor and hopefully avoidable inconvenience. (Like I said, I really love ice cream.) I studied this ancient system because I suspected that it might hold some secret truths that Westerners would benefit from knowing about.</p>
<p><i>""Do you believe in Chinese Medicine?""  </i> A lot of people have faith in modern medicine. Alternative medicine does not generally elicit such mass devotion. However, <strong>faith has no place in the world of medicine</strong>, though modern medicine would have us believe otherwise. So to answer the question, I do not believe in Chinese medicine, nor any other medical system. I know that Chinese medicine works well and that it's safe.  </p>
<p>There is rarely a need to take a leap of faith with regards to one's health, when we have access to evidence and experience. When it comes to health, an educated decision will always serve us better than a decision based on faith. Chinese medicine is eons ahead of modern medicine, in experience and in depth of understanding health, and will always remain so, considering that they got a 2000 year head start. 2000 years of experience is certainly enough to make faith unnecessary.</p>
<p>""The Truth About Health"" is <i>not </i>about Chinese Medicine. The research in this book covers a wide variety of health topics and is non-denominational. (See below for a list of topics covered.) I have spent over a decade researching many questions about health, healthcare, and disease. My columns were featured in various publications over the years, including The English Update, Arutz Sheva, Hamodia, Mishpacha Magazine, Tachlis Magazine, and more. The amount of information I was able to share on a given subject depended a lot on the publisher. </p>
<p>When my uncut material <i>was </i>published, the new ideas I presented often elicited strong public reactions. Some people saw their long standing suspicions finally backed up with evidence. Some people loved my revolutionary exposes, others were disconcerted when I challenged the status-quo; but no one will ever accuse me of being boring.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">One day my magazine editor told me,  ""Yael, you know you have enough material for a book. Why don't you write one?"" </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Since boring books about health usually collect dust in the bookcase, I have made every effort to write a book that is  easy to read, useful, and entertaining. The book is also full of new and groundbreaking information.  </span>We are lucky to have found an open-minded, top-notch publisher that believes in my book. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">N</span>ot just anyone would publish a book that defies the medical establishment's take on reality.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>According to our publisher, we anticipate that it will take about a year to prepare the book for print.  We would really love to print more than 1000 copies. The more successful the campaign, the more books we'll print.</p>
<p>Since I am not afraid to speak the truth, my material is often (usually) controversial. While my writing has been printed many times over in various publications, the truth is not always popular, and is often censored. So although there is plenty of demand for the uncut truth, status quo is a powerful force, which doesn't have much tolerance for revolutionary ideas. That's why we are thrilled to have found an open-minded publisher who is eager to print the <strong>uncensored </strong>truth. </p>
<p>Societal beliefs are formed by the reality that the media presents to the public. My goal is to give you a new reality. The truth is not always the most popular opinion (in fact, it's usually the <i>least </i>popular). But I'm sticking to my guns and continuing to research. I have not yet busted every myth out there. I'll keep you posted!</p>

""Yael has a real gift for taking difficult and complex concepts and making them understandable and accessible! Her book is informative and entertaining.  A must read!"" Shana D.
""Your book is GOOD!"", Yocheved L. 
""I couldn't put it down!"" Tamar K.
 
Update: The deadline for this campaign has been extended by 30 days.
I don't like reading boring books. And I would certainly take no pleasure in boring you. I once read a book about calcium(!) that was so dull, that it put me to sleep in one minute flat, which worked out great, because it saved me from a bad case of jet-lag. I would not recommend that book to my worst enemy.
I am also not a health nut. Ice cream is and has always been my favorite food. I'm just a truth-seeker, and I don't like being duped. For the last 15 years, nearly every person I have encountered, has asked me the exact same question: ""How did you get into the field of Chinese medicine?"" Which may translate:  Why would you venture so far off the beaten path? No accountants or actuaries are asked this question. 
There's another question people ask me. It usually follows directly after the one above: ""Do you believe in Chinese Medicine?""  I will answer both of these questions for you now, because these questions are the reason I started writing what ultimately became this book. 
The reason I chose to study Chinese Medicine was because I have long sensed that modern medicine was fumbling in the dark in too many areas. There were simply too many unanswered questions, too many contradictions. This lit a fire under me to find the truth about what really causes disease, and what cures it.
It was my interest in truth that led me to study Chinese Medicine. The fact that Chinese Medicine offers a fairly ascetic and regimented approach to health was not the main attraction for me. It was more of a minor and hopefully avoidable inconvenience. (Like I said, I really love ice cream.) I studied this ancient system because I suspected that it might hold some secret truths that Westerners would benefit from knowing about.
""Do you believe in Chinese Medicine?""   A lot of people have faith in modern medicine. Alternative medicine does not generally elicit such mass devotion. However, faith has no place in the world of medicine, though modern medicine would have us believe otherwise. So to answer the question, I do not believe in Chinese medicine, nor any other medical system. I know that Chinese medicine works well and that it's safe.  
There is rarely a need to take a leap of faith with regards to one's health, when we have access to evidence and experience. When it comes to health, an educated decision will always serve us better than a decision based on faith. Chinese medicine is eons ahead of modern medicine, in experience and in depth of understanding health, and will always remain so, considering that they got a 2000 year head start. 2000 years of experience is certainly enough to make faith unnecessary.
""The Truth About Health"" is not about Chinese Medicine. The research in this book covers a wide variety of health topics and is non-denominational. (See below for a list of topics covered.) I have spent over a decade researching many questions about health, healthcare, and disease. My columns were featured in various publications over the years, including The English Update, Arutz Sheva, Hamodia, Mishpacha Magazine, Tachlis Magazine, and more. The amount of information I was able to share on a given subject depended a lot on the publisher. 
When my uncut material was published, the new ideas I presented often elicited strong public reactions. Some people saw their long standing suspicions finally backed up with evidence. Some people loved my revolutionary exposes, others were disconcerted when I challenged the status-quo; but no one will ever accuse me of being boring.  One day my magazine editor told me,  ""Yael, you know you have enough material for a book. Why don't you write one?"" 
Since boring books about health usually collect dust in the bookcase, I have made every effort to write a book that is  easy to read, useful, and entertaining. The book is also full of new and groundbreaking information.  We are lucky to have found an open-minded, top-notch publisher that believes in my book. Not just anyone would publish a book that defies the medical establishment's take on reality.
By pre-ordering your sponsor's copy of my book, you will help us bring this lifesaving information to the world. The more funding we get, the more copies we can print. Every contribution will help us reach our goal! Thank you!

Our Goal


Our goal is to raise $11,000. This amount takes care of publication costs including: content edit, copy-edit, proofread, layout, cover design, creative oversight, project management, overseeing printing, arranging distribution, and printing of 1000 copies of the book. If we raise more, we will be able to print more!

We have some outside sponsors as well, who will make sure the book goes to print, so the finished product is guaranteed.
The Impact

Knowledge is power. When it comes to healthcare, knowledge can mean the difference between life and death. Protect your health and the health of your loved ones by getting informed and gaining the tools to take part in important medical decisions. 
The book is written, and we are currently in the final stages to bring it to print. By helping fund this project, you will assist us in bringing The Truth About Health to the world .

Risks & Challenges
According to our publisher, we anticipate that it will take about a year to prepare the book for print.  We would really love to print more than 1000 copies. The more successful the campaign, the more books we'll print.
Since I am not afraid to speak the truth, my material is often (usually) controversial. While my writing has been printed many times over in various publications, the truth is not always popular, and is often censored. So although there is plenty of demand for the uncut truth, status quo is a powerful force, which doesn't have much tolerance for revolutionary ideas. That's why we are thrilled to have found an open-minded publisher who is eager to print the uncensored truth. 
Societal beliefs are formed by the reality that the media presents to the public. My goal is to give you a new reality. The truth is not always the most popular opinion (in fact, it's usually the least popular). But I'm sticking to my guns and continuing to research. I have not yet busted every myth out there. I'll keep you posted!

<h3>The Author:</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507926126/vgtse7urv3ullu1dnvmz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Now to be a little less spooky, maybe?  Hey! I’m Jessica Walsh, also known as “Snow Cosplays.” I’m a freelance writer, seamstress, and all around artist who spends the bulk of her time travelling to conventions around the US to sell my books and art alongside my partner, Briana Lawrence (Brichibi Cosplays). I write freelance scripts for WatchMojo.com, and have had various stories published by Apex Magazine, Dreamspinner Press, and have successfully self-published several novels with my partner. While we’re known more for our colorful costumes and our urban fantasy stories, I have a deep love for horror, and have taken on my first solo project to create a lingering feeling of dread within my potential readers.</p>
<h2>The Story:</h2>
</div><div>
<p>Fear isn’t always loud. It doesn’t always scream or announce itself with a loud thud on the closet door. Sometimes it creeps, slithers, and crawls. Sometimes it’s waiting in the shadows, whispering as you pass by. These stories may not scare you, but one or two whispers may burrow into the back of your brain. They may make you shiver at night and consider, for just a moment, that maybe you left the front door unlocked... and maybe those weren’t your cat’s footsteps you heard inside.</p>
<p>Little Creepers will be a collection of horror stories in a variety of styles. Some are a loud slam of the door while others brush against the back of your neck. Some are long enough to fill an abandoned hallway while others are notes scratched on the back of a dusty stair. All of them scare me in one way or another if I think about them too much, and the only way to relieve that fear is to pass it on.</p>
<p>I’m planning 13 frightening stories to share with you, but depending on how the campaign goes, there may be more creeping through the hallway when we’re finished.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Campaign:</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.sewntogetherreflections.com/books"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">My partner and I are seasoned in the world of self-publishing thanks to our other releases and freelance work</a>. We do our best to create books that will entertain -- and, in this case, terrify -- our audience. However, to do this, many costs have to be paid up front. This is where you can help me out! By pledging various tiers through this campaign you’ll help me gather the money needed to put this book into production and square everything away.</p>
<p>By reaching the goal, and possibly even exceeding it, you’ll help me launch this book and share these creepy stories with the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507925508/csidtdyotclqut6peqtx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Extras and Items:</h3>
<p>Like any good horror story, any sort of contribution will have an effect - whether it’s large or small depends on you and your actions.</p>
<p>Along with the physical and ebook version of Little Creepers, there are a couple other items offered in the tiers of this campaign which deserve their own explanation:</p>
<p>Mini Print - With each physical order there will be a 4x6 mini print of the front cover of the book designed by Dave Branch. These mini prints are exclusives and will not be sold outside this campaign.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Seeking-Storyteller-Hunters-Jessica-Walsh/dp/1508901147/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Seeking the Storyteller</a> - The first of my Urban Fantasy series with my partner Briana Lawrence. This story is not horror, but is perfect for those who like the idea that something supernatural lurks in our world, just out of sight. Somewhere in the shows there is a creature called the Storyteller who can read your life like a book and change it any way he wants. This series is about the people who want this power and what they’ll do to obtain it.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Beneath-Chapter-Hunters-Jessica-Walsh/dp/1530897742/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Beneath the Chapter</a> - Book 2 in our Urban Fantasy series delves deeper into the world of the Storyteller and those seeking that power… and those who’ve decided to protect it.</p>
<p>""Written in Stone"" - This is a very special and limited perk. Should you pick this listing your name will be written into one of the stories. As the author I’ll decide which story and what role your name will play. The character may have a shade of you - if I know you - or may simply be your name. However I can’t guarantee if you’ll be a creature, a victim, or a not so innocent bystander, so proceed with caution. (Please be aware that screen names and inappropriate names will not be accepted.)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Stretch Goals:</h3>
<p>As a creator and storyteller sometimes I like the idea of giving my creations the chance to grow on their own. Should this campaign over perform, there are a few more things which I’ll be able to set into motion.</p>
<p>$2500 - A 14th story will be added to the anthology! Once we reach this mark, I’ll reveal the working title.</p>
<p>$3000 - More art! Should we reach this goal I'll add a piece of my own art to the book.  This will also be included as a second mini art print with all physical orders that will only be sold through this campaign.</p>
<p>$3500 - A 15th story! Once we reach this tier another story of mine will be added to the anthology and I’ll reveal the title!</p>
<p>$4000 - Even more art! I have a couple other artists I’ve come across with amazing art that I’d love to include in the book. Once we hit this tier I’ll add another illustration and I’ll announce the artist at this time.</p>
<p>$5000 - An audio book! Perhaps you like your horror to lean a bit more toward the campfire days. Should we reach this lofty goal, then we’ll be able to put this audio book into production! I already have a reader planned and will announce who it is and a time frame once we meet this goal!</p>
<p>$6000 - Guest Story - While I’m the lover of horror, occasionally my friends dabble in it too. Should we reach this lofty goal, a special guest story will be added to the anthology. I can’t tell you who the author is yet, but it’s not me. I'll reveal who the author is once we reach this point.</p>
<p>$10,000 - Big Dreams! I remember as a child reading an anthology called <strong>Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</strong> and how those stories and the art affected me. Should we reach this goal I’ll be able to reach out to several artists and have illustrations created and included for each of the stories in this book. Should we reach this tier it will delay the printing time of the book, but it will be well worth it to see the final creation.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h3>
<p>With self publishing comes risks. Such books are occasionally viewed as less professional and are often overlooked. There’s a chance that it won’t sell beyond this campaign or that it won’t sell as well as our other books.</p>
<p>However, I am nothing if not persistent. My partner and I are experienced in selling our books at conventions, signings, and other events. As of right now we have three self published novels under our belt, plus a collection of novellas and short stories through various publishers. We have partnerships with several other authors, creative individuals, and an entire plethora of resources at our disposal to get this book out there with your help. We are also very familiar with reaching out in person, through social media, and through partnerships to get our message across. I can assure you we’ll use all these resources for this book, as we have for all of our others.</p>
<p>Currently the book is 90% written, so I’m already well on the way to completing it. This campaign is to help with the upfront costs of self publishing <strong>Little Creepers</strong> and to run an organized presale of the book. Plus, I want to offer bonus items to those who have helped bring these stories to print.</p>Thank you for checking out my Indiegogo. Just be careful that nothing follows you home in the shadows.</div></div>","The Author:

Now to be a little less spooky, maybe?  Hey! I’m Jessica Walsh, also known as “Snow Cosplays.” I’m a freelance writer, seamstress, and all around artist who spends the bulk of her time travelling to conventions around the US to sell my books and art alongside my partner, Briana Lawrence (Brichibi Cosplays). I write freelance scripts for WatchMojo.com, and have had various stories published by Apex Magazine, Dreamspinner Press, and have successfully self-published several novels with my partner. While we’re known more for our colorful costumes and our urban fantasy stories, I have a deep love for horror, and have taken on my first solo project to create a lingering feeling of dread within my potential readers.
The Story:

Fear isn’t always loud. It doesn’t always scream or announce itself with a loud thud on the closet door. Sometimes it creeps, slithers, and crawls. Sometimes it’s waiting in the shadows, whispering as you pass by. These stories may not scare you, but one or two whispers may burrow into the back of your brain. They may make you shiver at night and consider, for just a moment, that maybe you left the front door unlocked... and maybe those weren’t your cat’s footsteps you heard inside.
Little Creepers will be a collection of horror stories in a variety of styles. Some are a loud slam of the door while others brush against the back of your neck. Some are long enough to fill an abandoned hallway while others are notes scratched on the back of a dusty stair. All of them scare me in one way or another if I think about them too much, and the only way to relieve that fear is to pass it on.
I’m planning 13 frightening stories to share with you, but depending on how the campaign goes, there may be more creeping through the hallway when we’re finished.

The Campaign:
My partner and I are seasoned in the world of self-publishing thanks to our other releases and freelance work. We do our best to create books that will entertain -- and, in this case, terrify -- our audience. However, to do this, many costs have to be paid up front. This is where you can help me out! By pledging various tiers through this campaign you’ll help me gather the money needed to put this book into production and square everything away.
By reaching the goal, and possibly even exceeding it, you’ll help me launch this book and share these creepy stories with the world.
 

 
Extras and Items:
Like any good horror story, any sort of contribution will have an effect - whether it’s large or small depends on you and your actions.
Along with the physical and ebook version of Little Creepers, there are a couple other items offered in the tiers of this campaign which deserve their own explanation:
Mini Print - With each physical order there will be a 4x6 mini print of the front cover of the book designed by Dave Branch. These mini prints are exclusives and will not be sold outside this campaign.
Seeking the Storyteller - The first of my Urban Fantasy series with my partner Briana Lawrence. This story is not horror, but is perfect for those who like the idea that something supernatural lurks in our world, just out of sight. Somewhere in the shows there is a creature called the Storyteller who can read your life like a book and change it any way he wants. This series is about the people who want this power and what they’ll do to obtain it.
Beneath the Chapter - Book 2 in our Urban Fantasy series delves deeper into the world of the Storyteller and those seeking that power… and those who’ve decided to protect it.
""Written in Stone"" - This is a very special and limited perk. Should you pick this listing your name will be written into one of the stories. As the author I’ll decide which story and what role your name will play. The character may have a shade of you - if I know you - or may simply be your name. However I can’t guarantee if you’ll be a creature, a victim, or a not so innocent bystander, so proceed with caution. (Please be aware that screen names and inappropriate names will not be accepted.)

Stretch Goals:

Trabajo como técnico de diseño en una empresa dedicada a la fabricación de luminarias con

Mi mayor sueño consiste en publicar “Sombras
en el jardín”, un libro que contiene nueve relatos de temática variada:
“El funcionario” comienza con la negativa del encargado del registro de un pequeño pueblo a expedir un certificado de nacimiento a un ama de casa. Tan curioso conflicto burocrático
propiciará, al menos, un entrañable acercamiento entre ambos, después
de que el excéntrico funcionario decida mostrar su lado más humano, intentando justificar su
comportamiento de una forma tan extravagante como conmovedora.


La protagonista de ""Sombras en el jardín"", víctima de la falta de escrúpulos de su marido, naufraga en medio de una
tempestad de desesperación, cuya resaca
acabará por arrastrarla hacia un desenlace tan ineludible como sorprendente.
Esta intensa historia (que aborda temas como la corrupción de la clase
gobernante, la marginación, la falta de comunicación o los malos tratos) está escrita con la intención de que el lector se involucre en la trama, descifrando una serie de claves que le harán pensar incluso después de acabada la lectura.




La aparición de un globo aerostático, anclado en pleno paseo
marítimo de un pequeño pueblo, supondrá una novedad en las
aburridas vidas de sus habitantes, que serán testigos del pulso que mantendrá “El
aeronauta” con las autoridades locales durante una buena temporada.
“Carrera imposible hacia
poniente” es el desgarrador relato (breve pero intenso) del sufrimiento que padecen los dos únicos
supervivientes de un destacamento militar que queda aislado en un paraje remoto
y desolador, cuyas terribles condiciones les someterán a la prueba más dura de
sus vidas.
Otros relatos: ""La rueda"", ""El sonriente"", ""Después de Eva"", ""El olor de la realidad"" y ""Memorias sobre el albero"".



Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes 
El objetivo de esta campaña es recaudar los fondos necesarios
para poder publicar y distribuir mi libro ""Sombras en

inicial de cien ejemplares con cubierta dura, y doscientos ejemplares con cubierta flexible, asegurándome así poder cumplir con todos las recompensas.
En el caso de que la campaña obtenga menos dinero,
igualmente publicaría el libro aunque tuviera que reducir la
tirada, ajustándola a la cantidad recaudada.
Las recompensas se detallan en las distintas categorías de contribución.
¡Muchas gracias a todos por colaborar en la consecución de un

   El impacto 




En estos días de crisis, debido a nuestra pérdida de poder

el crowdfunding es la mejor vía para la financiación de proyectos

   Riesgos y desafíos  

En principio, el riesgo principal consiste en no poder publicar ni distribuir una buena cantidad de ejemplares para compartir mi libro con el mayor número posible de lectores, pero la clave está, como he dicho, en adaptar la tirada a la cantidad final obtenida.   Otras formas en las que puedes ayudar

piece by piece under ""many hats."" I insert recipes I
have written, hotside cooking tips, pastry and bread error/correction guides
and some decent drinks, places to drink and reasons not to drink. What seems to
be a tragedy, evolves to a passionate description of living in a post-magical

cooking. Lots of cooking. And lots of drugs, about as much crime and drugs
as there is food and all surrounding seven years of active military

<br/>
<p>Margret Fisher is a story about a young
woman that finds herself depressed in the only way most young women feel it,
torn between two lovers.</p>
<p><span><span>She finds herself daydreaming about both
men, trying to work out the best way to deal with both and to make a decision
on allowing one of them to get close. As soon as Margret thought she had the
right answer something unthinkable happened, her life changed forever. Without the proper
words to tell her best friend, Melisa, Margret is caught in a spin of decisions
that could make or break her relationship, her friendship and mostly important
her heart.</span></span></p>

<br/><span><span></span></span>
<p><span><span><b>How The Story Started and What It Means to Me</b><br/></span></span></p>
<p>I started writing Margret about several months ago when I was
faced with the same challenge of losing my best friend and trying to keep a new
relationship going.</p>

</div><br/></div>","The Story of Margret Fisher

Margret Fisher is a story about a young
woman that finds herself depressed in the only way most young women feel it,
torn between two lovers.
She finds herself daydreaming about both
men, trying to work out the best way to deal with both and to make a decision
on allowing one of them to get close. As soon as Margret thought she had the
right answer something unthinkable happened, her life changed forever. Without the proper
words to tell her best friend, Melisa, Margret is caught in a spin of decisions
that could make or break her relationship, her friendship and mostly important
her heart.



How The Story Started and What It Means to Me
I started writing Margret about several months ago when I was
faced with the same challenge of losing my best friend and trying to keep a new
relationship going.
Margret is an inspiration to me in the sense that many young women
my age can learn that life is not always about pleasing everyone but also
making time and space for yourself as well as taking time to think and take
your own advice.
  What We Need & What You Get  
I will be using the funds to pay for the printing and editing of
the books through Dog Ear Publishing.

I decided to self-publishing because I wanted to see how different it is to traditional publishing. Perks include personal letters, postcards, Ebooks and signed paperback books.

 If I don't reach the total amount of funds I will use the funds I do have to edit and proofread the manuscript with an qualified editor. 
    

The Impact
Your contribution will mean the world to me regardless of how big
or small it is. By contributing to my project you are not only helping me start
the biggest of my dreams but also helping in setting a stepping stone to
complete more books like this and other greater adventures.
  Risks & Challenges
There aren't many risks involved except having something go
wrong at the printing house, however this is rather impossible as Dog Ear
Publishing has given their word that they do the very best of work.

Currently Margret Fisher is the last stages of being edited by the author. The
challenge here is that it could easy take up to another month to have the book
in perfect shape.

Frustrated because i wanted something cheap, original, personalized and new, as last years i depleted all my ideas, i quit searching and after a few days i came up with this book idea and i started writing it. All my friends wanted one, and encouraged me to try to sell this world-wide and also make an English version. At our local tv station it was voted the no.1 present of 2015.</p>
<p>So here it is :)</p>
<p>The book is called 1000 Reasons For Loving You, and i wrote only 990, because i left the last 2 pages blank so you can write the last 10 reasons and other personalized messages. This way you will bring your personal contribution. Therefore, on the back cover i put a field where the coauthor can sign, and obviously the coauthor will be each one of you, because the book will be completed by you and therefore each copy of the book will be original.</p>
<p>This way you can make a present for your lover no matter if it is a 'he' or a 'she'. All the reasons are unisex and fit perfect no matter if you are giving it to a female or a male.</p>
<p>The advantages are that you will be able to give a truly original present, and also bring your personal contribution to it. (Yes, especially females will love this!) It might even get you laid :)</p>
<p>Another advantage is the fact that this is considered a cheap present... (below 20$).</p>
<p>The biggest thing yet, it's the fact that you will make her or him a present that for sure it will be the first time she or he gets this, because it's the first time this kind of present and ideea exists.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Before i will go trough the process of subscribing this book and making contracts with the international books distributors, i said to myself that Indiegogo would be the best place to test if there is a market for my book, or if people would find this attractive and buy it. Making a project here is very fast and inexpensive compared to the other variant i have. So i said i will start here.</p>
<p>If you like this project of mine, all you can do is buy a book in advance here and this way you would help me to be able to print a large batch with a far better price than usual. </p>
<p>I can assure you that there is no other book like this on this planet and wont be very soon as it is internationally patented.</p>
<p>I added perks up to 10 books, as some friends of mine bought up to 10, as they say, to have birthday presents prepared for any occasion right at hand :)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Shipping</h3>
<div>If we reach our goal of 5000$ we will start shipping right away. If for example we will reach 5000$ by 1 of June, we will start shipping with 3th of June.</div>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Refunds and problems</b></h3>
<div>We have to mention here that we will not be responsible for any problems regarding the delivery in the buyer's country. If you misspelled your address or if you encounter any delays please understand that we can not interfere with the post office in your country and we can not make any refunds as if the package gets back to us it will be more expensive to pay to get them back than the value of the book. We can only guarantee that we will ship the package properly sealed, respecting the laws of international printed merchandise and we can send you the receipt of the expedition in case of any problems. </div>
<div>If somehow anyone wants his books sent with tracking via DHL like services, we will provide you the tracking code right after shipping. </div>

I intend to say to the world. Starting with Colorado. Loosing Dawn was the most devestating event in my life thus far that this heart has had to endure .. everything in me wanted to curl up and hide... I was ready to completely give up. Not only did I loose my lover I lost my best friend.. my most trusted companion. Never before had I felt so lost and utterly alone on this planet. The idea of moving forward in the world with out her  breathing beside me was not one I was interested in entertaining. Giving up is not now and has never been an option in my life. Dawn may not physically be beside me but I know I carry the love we shared stronger then ever in my heart. That love gives power to my pulse and pushes me to keep moving. </p><p>L.Y.S.B.I.S.R is a  raw, and gritty collection of sketches, photographs, poetry, and love letters  that tell the story of finding rare friendships in strange places ,addiction and all the amazing people the needle has cost this earth, falling in love , betrayal, heartbreak, family, murder, withdrawal and the cops that beat me sencless after an hour long chase that landed me in the Klink.. This collection will explain how I found freedom while incarcerated, found love in recovery and gave up  nearly 7 years of clean time because I belived I could walk back into hell and carry my soul mate out ... She took her last breath on October 11, 2014...truth is..  it nearly killed us both.  We would have been married on January 1, 2015 in New York, New York...Central Park to be exact.</p><p> I couldn't even attend her funeral .. Instead I sat in jail in Adams County Colorado a.k.a  the 7th circle of hell. .with a bond that was less then most of my shoes cost.. come to find out it was best I didn't go...  What most people didn't know is I cried my eyes out the very first time I saw her with a syringe... That I begged her not to open that door and exhausthed myself in an attempt to express the demons that we welcome in when we esclate our addiction in such a way . People always say addiction is addiction is addiction.. and I agree to an extent... Still from personal experience and a long hard road littered w loss and heartache introducing the needle introduces a whole new world of pain and suffering. We were each others whole world's. Inseparable! Head over heels in love! None of us saw this coming.. We both came from honest hard working loving families and grew up in nice homes. I know her family had their hands full and her passing was an unexpected blow to all who loved her.. I only wish I could had been more involved, or involved at all.  And I can only imagine the heartbreak they must have been and still today are going through.   Had Dawn wanted to live a different lifestyle without drugs she would have been welcomed into her family's home with open arms. Further had Dawn wanted to live a different life I would have gladly laid down the weapons and tools of that world to rebuild our life in the light. Unfortunately that was not a choice she was ready to make.. and knowing the deamons that dwell where the needle slides in I was hell bent on keeping her safe... Guess I failed miserably in that department. I would have happily givin my own life to save hers... Offered up my own pulse to keep her heart in rythem. Two winters ago  we nearly froze to death trying to stay warm sleeping in apartment Lobbys and holding our dogs (Naboo &amp; Lyric) inside of our jackets to keep them warm. </p><p>When the dectivies came to question me at the jail and informed me she had passed away I already knew.  I knew the exact moment... And many may never believe this... But I was well aware the instant she left this life .... Because at that exact moment ..my own heart shattered onto thousands of pieces. I knew Dawn had gone from us because I felt my heart break . I felt completely hollow... As though someone had carved out my insides... I saw us growing old along side one another... Her perfect hands were most cirtenly designed to fit in my own. </p><p>Home...</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;""> It just wasn't the same with out the light our love created.. it wasn't  our home. I saw us laughing with our eyes dressed in wrinkles and our hair long and gray. ... On the porch of the house we built with our own hands... I would strum my guitar and sing the 97th love song I'd just written for her . Everything became surreal.... My mind and my heart knew she was gone... But I couldn't accept that to be reality.. I couldn't leave our house. When I was released from Adams I shook those bricks to hurry back to the home we fought tooth and nail to call our own.  We were wild and completely open with one another... I was more in love with her then ever. More attracted and enammered by her beauty and her gorgeous smile. God that smile....

Firstly somebody needs to address the gross lack of resources for homeless women in Denver Colorado. We had years prior owned and operated a backpackers hostel and had been quite successful. We could use a similar business model but gear our establishment toward Denver's homeless women opening a non profit to be called The Skinny Pocket Inn. So let this be the first promise I break to my beautiful partner.. I plan to say L.Y.S.B.I.S.R. to the world... I plan to share our story with all who will listen  and all proceeds in excess of publishing costs will go to fund The Skinny Pocket Inn a homeless shelter in Colorado for women in need. Reciently I purchased 5 acres of land in Park County Colorado. I have been doing tons of research on green living and building materials. I strongly feel that storage container housing is the way to go. We could significantly save on building costs and focus funding on more resources for the women we shelter. The storage container housing in combination with solar power and possibly collecting rainwater as a back up reserve. We could really build a beautiful self maintaining community for women to get back on thier feet and focus on the issues in thier lives that landed them where they are as to break the cycle of hopelessness. What better way to honor my best friend then to share our story and the hope we were filled with after we were handed keys to our very own space in the world.  What better way to every day say I love you then to share L.Y.S.B.I.S.R with the world. If you have any resources or suggestions I would be thrilled and encouraged to receive them. Maybe I am foolish.. Though I honestly feel as though this path was laid out for me by a higher power. In the midst of the most terrible season of grief my life has ever tasted I found a purpose and passion that helps me move my feet. An amazing gift has been givin to me in my venture to keep the dreams Dawn &amp; I shared alive... It's difficult to explain but somehow I've never felt closer to her then I do right now.. she will live in my heart forever and we will make this dream a reality!</p></div>","L.Y.S.B.I.S.R. = Love You So Bad I Said Remember...what started off as a reminder to my souls conpanion to REMEMBER always that she is loved and she matrers... I intend to say to the world. Starting with Colorado. Loosing Dawn was the most devestating event in my life thus far that this heart has had to endure .. everything in me wanted to curl up and hide... I was ready to completely give up. Not only did I loose my lover I lost my best friend.. my most trusted companion. Never before had I felt so lost and utterly alone on this planet. The idea of moving forward in the world with out her  breathing beside me was not one I was interested in entertaining. Giving up is not now and has never been an option in my life. Dawn may not physically be beside me but I know I carry the love we shared stronger then ever in my heart. That love gives power to my pulse and pushes me to keep moving. L.Y.S.B.I.S.R is a  raw, and gritty collection of sketches, photographs, poetry, and love letters  that tell the story of finding rare friendships in strange places ,addiction and all the amazing people the needle has cost this earth, falling in love , betrayal, heartbreak, family, murder, withdrawal and the cops that beat me sencless after an hour long chase that landed me in the Klink.. This collection will explain how I found freedom while incarcerated, found love in recovery and gave up  nearly 7 years of clean time because I belived I could walk back into hell and carry my soul mate out ... She took her last breath on October 11, 2014...truth is..  it nearly killed us both.  We would have been married on January 1, 2015 in New York, New York...Central Park to be exact. I couldn't even attend her funeral .. Instead I sat in jail in Adams County Colorado a.k.a  the 7th circle of hell. .with a bond that was less then most of my shoes cost.. come to find out it was best I didn't go...  What most people didn't know is I cried my eyes out the very first time I saw her with a syringe... That I begged her not to open that door and exhausthed myself in an attempt to express the demons that we welcome in when we esclate our addiction in such a way . People always say addiction is addiction is addiction.. and I agree to an extent... Still from personal experience and a long hard road littered w loss and heartache introducing the needle introduces a whole new world of pain and suffering. We were each others whole world's. Inseparable! Head over heels in love! None of us saw this coming.. We both came from honest hard working loving families and grew up in nice homes. I know her family had their hands full and her passing was an unexpected blow to all who loved her.. I only wish I could had been more involved, or involved at all.  And I can only imagine the heartbreak they must have been and still today are going through.   Had Dawn wanted to live a different lifestyle without drugs she would have been welcomed into her family's home with open arms. Further had Dawn wanted to live a different life I would have gladly laid down the weapons and tools of that world to rebuild our life in the light. Unfortunately that was not a choice she was ready to make.. and knowing the deamons that dwell where the needle slides in I was hell bent on keeping her safe... Guess I failed miserably in that department. I would have happily givin my own life to save hers... Offered up my own pulse to keep her heart in rythem. Two winters ago  we nearly froze to death trying to stay warm sleeping in apartment Lobbys and holding our dogs (Naboo & Lyric) inside of our jackets to keep them warm. When the dectivies came to question me at the jail and informed me she had passed away I already knew.  I knew the exact moment... And many may never believe this... But I was well aware the instant she left this life .... Because at that exact moment ..my own heart shattered onto thousands of pieces. I knew Dawn had gone from us because I felt my heart break . I felt completely hollow... As though someone had carved out my insides... I saw us growing old along side one another... Her perfect hands were most cirtenly designed to fit in my own. Home... It just wasn't the same with out the light our love created.. it wasn't  our home. I saw us laughing with our eyes dressed in wrinkles and our hair long and gray. ... On the porch of the house we built with our own hands... I would strum my guitar and sing the 97th love song I'd just written for her . Everything became surreal.... My mind and my heart knew she was gone... But I couldn't accept that to be reality.. I couldn't leave our house. When I was released from Adams I shook those bricks to hurry back to the home we fought tooth and nail to call our own.  We were wild and completely open with one another... I was more in love with her then ever. More attracted and enammered by her beauty and her gorgeous smile. God that smile....

I am an author who overcame his dyslexia after many years of tutoring and training both with the help of my school and privately. </p><p>I have been working on the book <i>The River Crosser</i> for some time, and as it approaches time to get the book in print and published, I will require funding in order to get the professional quality-controlled product that I know is possible.</p><p> I want to have these books made for dyslexic kids who are intermediates/beginners at reading, because when I was growing up there were very few good books for kids like me to read, with handicaps such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, and ADHD in mind.</p><p>So why should you support me?</p><p>To start, there are criminally few other authors attempting to write books with the needs of dyslexic kids in mind; including other dyslexic authors who would be suited to it. This is because a book for dyslexics would be slightly more difficult than is typical to write for kids (due to the complex formats), coupled with low awareness and empathy for the disorder.<br/><br/>Research has shown (From Yale's Dyslexia Research institute) that books written with rhymes, in verse, or with large amounts of poetry are more effective at getting dyslexics and other reading-troubled students to enjoy to read, as well as books with interesting artwork or spacial/shape dynamics.<br/><br/>The problem is that novels of this length and depth, especially for learning-troubled kids are quite the niche market. (though a necessary one, I believe, because books like these might help other learning disabled children as well.)</p>

He grows up in the city of Detroit, struggling to learn to read in the public school system. In the midst of his troubles, He steals from scrap heaps and grocery stores to survive. During this time, the boy comes in contact with a mysterious character known only as The Garbageman, who entrusts him with a cryptic text titled The River Crosser.Unable to read it, the boy spends the next 10 years deciphering the book.We follow the stubborn boy as he travels through time and change, building strange devices and attempting to contact the man on the other side of ""The River"" for answers about his book.Join me in this outlandish tale through some of the deepest recesses of human imagination.An easy and relatable read without sacrificing the rewarding qualities of a true challenge! This series will not pull any punches!
Read a preview of my book, The River Crosser by clicking here.
ABOUT THE AUTHOR:My name is Charles Dorton. I am an author who overcame his dyslexia after many years of tutoring and training both with the help of my school and privately. I have been working on the book The River Crosser for some time, and as it approaches time to get the book in print and published, I will require funding in order to get the professional quality-controlled product that I know is possible. I want to have these books made for dyslexic kids who are intermediates/beginners at reading, because when I was growing up there were very few good books for kids like me to read, with handicaps such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, and ADHD in mind.So why should you support me?To start, there are criminally few other authors attempting to write books with the needs of dyslexic kids in mind; including other dyslexic authors who would be suited to it. This is because a book for dyslexics would be slightly more difficult than is typical to write for kids (due to the complex formats), coupled with low awareness and empathy for the disorder.Research has shown (From Yale's Dyslexia Research institute) that books written with rhymes, in verse, or with large amounts of poetry are more effective at getting dyslexics and other reading-troubled students to enjoy to read, as well as books with interesting artwork or spacial/shape dynamics.The problem is that novels of this length and depth, especially for learning-troubled kids are quite the niche market. (though a necessary one, I believe, because books like these might help other learning disabled children as well.)

So, why write for Dyslexics?

Dyslexia is a problem for 17% of the U.S population, and even though there are so many of us, (the most represented in number learning disorder) there is critically low public support.

According to the same statistics from Yale's center for dyslexia research, 10% of the
population (over 16) and 2-3 children in every classroom has
dyslexia to some
degree. 4% of students are
severely dyslexic.

Only 24% of parents
believe that
dyslexia gets recognized - across
the whole
education system in the U.S.
Without support,
individuals may suffer
with problems in
literacy and numeracy
and may suffer long
term damage to their
self esteem because of deficits in their processing differences that they find tricks around, but will always struggle with without the proper strategies.
It is not compulsory to
learn about dyslexia in
teacher training. 55% of
parents feel that teachers
failed to recognize a
problem in their child’s
development.

So how does the book help dyslexics?
My mission with The River Crosser is to entertain and interest intermediate and beginning readers, while teaching them critical thinking strategies, as well as promoting empathy for dyslexic students who see things a little differently from their peers, because I was one, and I know how hard of a position it is.When I was growing up the books they gave us were incredibly boring. I remember that for all the pain that reading caused me, it was not worth it to get through a half hour long sentence just to read ""The cat jumped over the fence."" I needed more complex works to satisfy me. What ended up helping me most were poems by Edgar Allen Poe, Shakespeare, and other verse-inclined writers and authors. Things that I read, and were worth thinking about for a time.
On this theory, I set out to find out if there was something to that idea, and what I found was interesting;
There's a little bonus to the research as well. Books that are easier for dyslexics to read are also easier for non-dyslexics to read, and books that help dyslexics learn to read have been proven to help non-dyslexics learn to read at an even faster rate. What is a crutch to us is rocket boots to you!So what will the book provide exactly?


It is written almost entirely in verse, with elements of hip-hop and poetry to keep the readers interested.


It helps the reader to identify their difference in perspective without damage to their self esteem.

It provides the dyslexic reader with a sandbox world, with hard limits that get explained thoroughly. It provides philosophical and ethical questions to be answered within the context of the world; a place separate from reality, but close in complexity. What may seem trivial to you, but will be an invaluable tool for dyslexic kids who will grow to rely upon abductive reasoning  to get by.

The books will support and encourage outside of the box thinking that leads to innovation. 

It is as useful for teachers and parents as well as students for learning to empathize with dyslexia, due to the nature of the protagonist's own disorder.

It teaches kids that there are always alternative paths to acquiring the information they need to keep learning, because dyslexic children must find where a piece of information ""fits"" on their current model to understand. When teachers they look to for guidance aren't providing it, it is important that dyslexics find alternative means to piece together the image and continue learning.

</div></div>","Hi there! We are the Live Love team from Belgium, a synergy of 7 people who all share the same passion; bringing the LIVE LOVE TECHNOLOGY into the world. 




Now you probably wonder what the LIVE LOVE TECHNOLOGY is all about?It is a unique technology designed by Kaat Jacobs that provides you the manual of your bodily system. We were taught many things in school but not how to steer our bodies and create our lives from within. We share 15 years of experience on this field. 
Based on our own experiences we have found that this technology is the ultimate missing link to empowerment and manifesting a healthy, constructive life. Not only did we witness this in our own lives, but also in the lives of the many who applied the technology through us. Now imagine: if everyone in the world applies this technology, we all create happy and healthy lives - what a harmonious world we create together!
We write this book voluntarily out of service for every living creature on this planet and our dear planet. 
If you choose to fund this campaign, we are able to release this book onto the world and spread the LIVE LOVE TECHNOLOGY for all beings to benefit. As soon as 144.000 people reach this consciousness, the rest of the world shifts along with them. Yes, you read this right! The entire population will shift into constructive living.



goes to: 

- printing costs: 1000 books English + 1000 books Dutch = € 7.500- translation costs from Dutch to English: € 2000- wrapping costs: € 1000
(Discover our unique perks)









You probably wonder 'why not an e-book, why a tangible book'? Well, simply because a book is full of words and a word carries a frequency. When you touch a book you allow the frequency to enter your body and the frequency to get in tune with your body. This enhances the absorption of the information in the book into the brain. So what we describe will get easier into your subconscious. Because in order to fully integrate this natural way of living the information has to go to the subconscious. 

Can you imagine the vast impact it has if everyone learns to optimally steer their body and master their emotions? Then nobody projects their emotions on the outer world and there will be no more war and destructivity in this world. 
We successfully reached already thousands of people who changed their lives and their relationships. We are amazed by how fast people transform from disconnected, selfish, taking creatures to connected, sharing, loving beings. This is our wish for us, you and the world. 
Please share this campaign.With Love, the Live Love team

Hallo liefdevolle mens! Wij zijn het Live Love team uit België, een synergie van 7 mensen die dezelfde passie delen: het in de wereld brengen van de LIVE LOVE TECHNOLOGY. 



Je bent waarschijnlijk benieuwd waar de LIVE LOVE TECHNOLOGY voor staat? 
Wel, dat is een unieke techniek ontwikkeld door Kaat Jacobs, die jouw handleiding is tot de besturing van je lichamelijk systeem. Men heeft ons veel dingen geleerd op school maar niet hoe je lichaam te besturen en je leven te creëren van binnenuit. Wij beschikken over 15 jaar ervaring in dit veld. 
Gebaseerd op onze eigen ondervindingen hebben we ontdekt dat deze techniek de ultieme missing link is tot bekrachtiging en het manifesteren van een gezond en constructief leven. We hebben het niet enkel ondervonden in onze eigen levens. We zien het ook gebeuren bij de velen die de door ons doorgegeven techniek toepassen. 
Stel je nu voor: als iedereen in de wereld deze techniek toepast en zijn/haar lichaam optimaal bestuurt, dan komt iedereen daardoor in een gelukkig en gezond leven terecht. Dan kunnen we niet anders dan een harmonieuze wereld creëren samen! 
Wij schrijven dit boek vrijwillig vanuit dienstbaarheid voor elk levend wezen op deze planeet en de planeet zelf. 
Als jij mee deze campagne steunt, dan zijn wij in staat dit boek in de wereld te brengen en de LIVE LOVE TECHNOLOGY te verspreiden zodat iedereen het kan toepassen in zijn/haar leven en er mee van kan genieten. Wanneer 144.000 mensen in dit bewustzijn komen, dan volgt het collectieve van de wereld automatisch. Ja, je leest het juist. De gehele wereldbevolking zal dan draaien naar een constructief leven. 




gaat naar: 



print kosten: 1000 boeken Nederlands + 1000 boeken Engels = € 7.500


vertalingskosten van Nederlands naar Engels: € 2000


inpakkosten: € 1000


(Ontdek onze unieke perks)





Je vraagt waarschijnlijk ‘waarom geen e-book, waarom een tastbaar boek?’ Wel, dit is eenvoudigweg omdat een boek vol woorden staat en een woord een frequentie met zich draagt. Als je een boek aanraakt sta je de frequentie toe je lichaam binnen te stromen en ermee in overeenstemming te komen. Dit vergemakkelijkt de opname van de informatie in het boek in de hersenen. Dus wat we schrijven zal op die manier vlotter in je onderbewuste geraken. Want om deze natuurlijke levensstijl ten volle te integreren is het noodzakelijk dat de informatie in je onderbewuste terechtkomt. Kan je je de impact inbeelden als iedereen leert om zijn/haar lichaam optimaal te besturen en zijn/haar emoties meester te zijn? Dan projecteert niemand nog emoties op de buitenwereld en dan vallen oorlog en destructiviteit weg in deze wereld. 
We hebben reeds duizenden mensen bereikt die hun leven en relaties herschapen hebben. We vinden het fantastisch te zien hoe snel mensen transformeren van afgescheiden, egoïstische, nemende wezens naar verbonden, delende, liefhebbende wezens. Dit is wat wij wensen voor ons, voor jou en deze wereld.

<p>Getbooks is not only a company but also a vision.</p>
<p>Hi, we are Paul and Ben Masenjnik, brothers, Israeli entrepreneurs and sworn book
enthusiasts. </p>
<p>We grew up in a home that considered reading as a noble activity,
the very thing that define one`s cultural identity. </p>
<p>As children, we enjoyed reading the Russian literature
classics and after making aliyah in 1990 we were presented with Hebrew and
English literature as well.</p>
<p>We used to read all the time, everywhere. We read at home,
in school, and even during our army service late at night, under the flashlight
while the rest of our platoon were asleep. Reading for us is a necessity, a
basic need.</p>
<p>Therefore, when digital books were presented to the public,
we immediately embraced the concept - an access to all the books in the world, all the time,
everywhere! What could be better?</p>
<p>(We even got our mom a Kindle for her birthday. She said it
was the best gift she ever got.)</p>
<p>After a few years of reading digitally we suddenly
realized that Paul was only reading books in Russian, while Ben was only
reading books in English. </p>
<p>The reason was plain: there were no digital books in
Hebrew.</p>
<p>As years went by, we became a father and an uncle, and
realized the technology was even worse when it came to children’s books. </p>
<p>This was a turning point in our journey. As multilinguals, we
were highly aware of the importance of language in children’s lives, and the immense
role it plays in their socialization. </p>
<p>Not all Jewish children grow up in Israel. However, even in
the diaspora, Jews and Israelis teach their children to read and write Hebrew. They
do so because Hebrew texts have been connecting us all for thousands of years, no
matter where we live. </p>
<p>Time has come to bridge this gap, and so <a href=""www.getbooks.co.il"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.getbooks.co.il</a> was created.</p>

<h3><b>More from the 2nd Foreword by Dr Eric Wilding</b></h3>
<p>""With a head full of ideas, a heart full of dreams and eyes full of visions; the author traces her own development with a vulnerable transparency. Each chapter is peppered with encounters of people—both old and young—who serve as mentors, inspiring her growth as a person. She is willing to look wherever the light is guiding her. The journey is not simply subjective; Tahira grounds her experiences in the latest scientific knowledge, while simultaneously allowing ancient wisdom to be part of the foundation.</p>
<p>With a fluid literary style, she allows readers to observe a narrative tapestry of technology, mathematics, geometry, philosophy, psychology, sociology, literature and spirituality. There are encounters that will challenge empirically minded readers. </p>
<p>Tahira Amir Khan is also an Innovator-Futurist. She envisions a world where we have learned to confront and overcome our anxieties, fears and animosities—replacing negative emotions with positive ones. This approach can help impact multiple sectors of societies. The technologies she sees can be used to aid humanity in its development of knowledge and compassion. The focus on healing the whole person (body, soul and spirit) could have implications for healing diverse cultures : families, businesses, religions, countries and ecosystems. What we view as the miraculous or supernatural could be a regular occurrence as we come to understand personal and collective identities and their mutual interdependence. </p>
<p>The journey comes towards a climax as Tahira soars in mystical encounters. The flow of the journey is guided by a deeply relational love. There is a joy and peace as she becomes increasingly aware of the selfless Unity that she has with nature, animals, humans and God. Moreover, she regards this as a praxiological possibility for others. The transformation of the author may be transferred to the readers as they joins hands with the author to experience walking through the Golden Door.""</p>

Or to put it another way, the not so different aspects of the One. For a greater part of her life Tahira has gravitated towards cerebral pursuits. Mathematics, technology, spirituality, art and entrepreneurial imperatives define not only the paradigm of her passions but the focal point of an instinctive drive. Several years ago certain encounters of a very unusual kind had her question the status quo and at a crossroads in life choose a path rife with risk and sacrifice, to answer the call of a higher purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-style: italic; background-color: initial;"">Within these chapters Tahira shares discoveries, interactions, illuminations and revelations and delivers the message she was meant to deliver.

A little more about the book
You as the reader will join hands with the Author in uncovering the Keys to the Golden Door toward the aspirations of the New World. Enjoy the stories and the experiences, empower yourself with the useful theories, get access to mind-altering and life-changing information that can only take you forward. Tahira Amir Khan is a technology entrepreneur who felt confined within the old world of the current and a craving for the new. Out of sheer interest, she began a journey studying the topic of planetary civilizations, when halfway through something else took over. A barreling of experiences from stigmata, supernatural experiences in Singapore and Pakistan, divine encounters while in Malaysia, revelatory messages as she explored the nature in Bali and more. A zealous unfolding impacting her life so greatly, that she began to feel that it was clearly the Hand of God intervening to relay a greater message not just for her, but all of Mankind.

More from the 1st Foreword by Ameerali R. Jumabhoy

""Whilst reporting on what can be succinctly described as a profound and moving set of experiences, Tahira Amir Khan manages to maintain a close relationship with the reader, bringing them back to her true message, in the heart of every chapter. When you encounter each chapter, at first the message seems to whisper to you, so softly that you may not hear it if you do not pay close enough attention. As you delve further and you read with concentration, you pick up on Tahira’s perceptiveness and delicacy of language that make this book the joy to read that it is. 


There are too many paeans to the power of spirituality that do not resonate with contemporary life. This book is not one of them. Tahira relates her experiences in a way that endears you to her and at the same time challenges your perceptions on the way the world is viewed by modern society. She augments her hypothesis with scientific explanations which bridge the gap between the seen and unseen. Her vision of society is also a model that has universal application and builds on common themes of morality that are often forgotten in modern society. The chapters in this book serve as a blueprint as to how to live a more calm, peaceful life imbued with a spiritual awareness and a strong but quiet sense of resilience. 


The greatest legacy of this book is one of the focus on Unity. Unity through the intimacy with God as well as through the interconnectedness of the world we live in today. That Tahira has so brilliantly portrayed her experiences and the world we live in is a testament to her clarity of thought, her tenacity of spirit and her honest objectivity. Readers will find this an accessible account of a life which is far from ordinary""

I was completely alone at the time. Whose voice was this? Shocked and startled, little did I realize that there was so much more to come. A river  of mind-altering communiques cascading through words, visions and surreal encounters. Month after month, year upon year.
At first I could not understand why, but over time I began to see its underlying purpose. I was simply  receiving what I had asked for. I had asked an umpteen number of questions over the years. Somehow I was ready for the downpour of answers now. 
The blinders came off, comprehension came naturally and the Truth that there existed and entirely new mode of thinking became palpable in March 2014. A fortuitous vision that set precedence for everything unfolded from there onward. The vision of the Golden Door.
Around the Golden Door was a circumference of many other doors, which though, were as mere shadows in comparison to the magnificence and grandeur of the Golden Door. The Golden Door was closed. I questioned why this door was shown to me. If there were Keys to opening this door, what were they? 
I imagined God sculpting the Keys. Without these Keys, we  could  continue to go around in circles, repeating the same mistakes endlessly  until we got it right. I was trying to make sense of it all at least in my own life moving up (or down) an imaginary scale. If this New World was through the Golden Door, would I be part of it?""


                                                                                                    (sketched by the Author)




 

There were the visitations

The Saints in White,  



Of the Ancient, the Current and the Future.
The flood of revelations,
The puzzles and the paradoxes. 




More from the 2nd Foreword by Dr Eric Wilding
""With a head full of ideas, a heart full of dreams and eyes full of visions; the author traces her own development with a vulnerable transparency. Each chapter is peppered with encounters of people—both old and young—who serve as mentors, inspiring her growth as a person. She is willing to look wherever the light is guiding her. The journey is not simply subjective; Tahira grounds her experiences in the latest scientific knowledge, while simultaneously allowing ancient wisdom to be part of the foundation.
With a fluid literary style, she allows readers to observe a narrative tapestry of technology, mathematics, geometry, philosophy, psychology, sociology, literature and spirituality. There are encounters that will challenge empirically minded readers. 
Tahira Amir Khan is also an Innovator-Futurist. She envisions a world where we have learned to confront and overcome our anxieties, fears and animosities—replacing negative emotions with positive ones. This approach can help impact multiple sectors of societies. The technologies she sees can be used to aid humanity in its development of knowledge and compassion. The focus on healing the whole person (body, soul and spirit) could have implications for healing diverse cultures : families, businesses, religions, countries and ecosystems. What we view as the miraculous or supernatural could be a regular occurrence as we come to understand personal and collective identities and their mutual interdependence. 
The journey comes towards a climax as Tahira soars in mystical encounters. The flow of the journey is guided by a deeply relational love. There is a joy and peace as she becomes increasingly aware of the selfless Unity that she has with nature, animals, humans and God. Moreover, she regards this as a praxiological possibility for others. The transformation of the author may be transferred to the readers as they joins hands with the author to experience walking through the Golden Door.""

Hear from the Reviewers
 ""Fantastic book, a great tool, a great source of strength and motivation.""  ~ Yassmen Kichlu, Holistic Wellness Guru

 ""A refreshing account of living a spiritual journey."" ~ Julia Fraser, Film Producer

""Very magical as it unfolds. I love how all the characters are introduced and then weaved to the central core of “our intimacy with God”, how each plays a part in unraveling the story. It is very powerful and written with immense control, yet freedom of a style that is engaging and thought provoking. I felt the passion and energy as I read, and I just love the flawless storytelling, weaving and weaving that intricate carpet of life on earth."" ~ Harjit Kaur, Senior Lecturer

 ""Prophecy will be fulfilled & pass away. As for knowledge, it will pass away & lose its value & be superseded by Truth. But love never fails, never fades out, or becomes obsolete, or comes to an end. This book is written by a woman who loves you enough to lay her life open before you."" ~ Kristen Daria Zuriel, Missionary


 ""The wealth of knowledge and experience Tahira shares in this book as she explores the choices we have for our future inspires one to start thinking about his/her own. An important book to read in the journey of self-discovery."" ~  Sanmuga Thavamoorthy, Online Magazine Editor

""This book is very powerful and thought provoking. Tahira is right when she says “There are somethings that can only be received from God in silence”. Through the experiences, I see this. Thank you. Thank you for sharing and keeping things simple enough for us to see and feel"" ~  Shikha Tuli, Educationist 




Now Hear from the Editors
An abstract from the review by Adil Naeem (Co-Editor):-
"" ... Every so often, the ""powers that be"" send particularly unique, courageous and gifted individuals to help us in our journey towards universal awareness and self-discovery, hopefully managing to convince us along the way that these are one and the same thing. Or to put it another way, the not so different aspects of the One. For a greater part of her life Tahira has gravitated towards cerebral pursuits. Mathematics, technology, spirituality, art and entrepreneurial imperatives define not only the paradigm of her passions but the focal point of an instinctive drive. Several years ago certain encounters of a very unusual kind had her question the status quo and at a crossroads in life choose a path rife with risk and sacrifice, to answer the call of a higher purpose.
Within these chapters Tahira shares discoveries, interactions, illuminations and revelations and delivers the message she was meant to deliver. So dear Reader , proceed with an open heart. Let Tahira show you the rainbow within the mist. At this crossroad let Tahira gently and lovingly, nudge you towards a path that promises gilded horizons.""
An abstract from the review by Flaviana Chelliah  (Co-Editor) :-
"" ... For the past three years, Tahira has conscientiously devoted the most part of her energies to finding the answers to a more meaningful life. During her search, she encountered a series of spiritual revelations which she wanted to share with as many people as possible ....
This book beautifully recounts Tahira's experiences, which explore symbolism, philosophical, scientific and spiritual teachings. I have learnt so much from her and welcome all of you to embark with her, on this journey of discovery.""



How the Funds will be used All funds raised from this campaign will be used for the book design, production and basic marketing for this first volume and for any marketing need for the book to reach the multitudes. 
Through our marketing efforts, we would like to reach as far and wide as possible. In fact, we would like to have a beyond a Paperback edition but also in DVD, Audiobook and perhaps a Book-to-Screen opportunity.  
These are just some of the marketing we will consider doing.




1) Online Book ADs via Google throughout the year,  monitored month by month


2) Professionally done Book Video and Author Video


3) 15 second video spot : A recent market analysis showed that ""consumers are 27 times more likely to click through online video ads than standard banners."" With the involvement of experts, we will professionally create a 15-second ad that could prompt more people to research and purchase the book.


4) Pre-releases: Delivery of your press release to media outlets chosen based on location, your book's genre and more; recipients may include magazines, newspapers, online publications, and radio and TV programs -One month of press-release tracking. 


5) Specialized Social Media Publicity : This will involve full-scale marketing campaigns for book print, web and video (Professionally written press release, optimized for the Web and distributed to media outlets carefully chosen based on location, book title, and genre. Media outlets could include magazines, newspapers, online publications, and radio and TV programs).
And if we exceed our funding goal, we can start making early plans for the film/DVD project. We have already rounded up a good team of Film Producers to help with the initial process! And by the way, if you choose the GOLD PERK and beyond, you may consider inviting you to participate in the project. 

  Risks & Challenges  The book is already complete and submitted to the Publishers. So that is one major risk out of the way.  Now it will go out for printing, sales and distribution. Based on the fact that the book has already received such good reviews, we can work out initial plans to convince film producers out there to a Book-to-Screen to happen. It's never too early!


FAQs
