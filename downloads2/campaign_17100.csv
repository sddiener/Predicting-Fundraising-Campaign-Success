<h3>About the work:</h3>
<p>My name is Khalif. I'm a theatre artist recently out of grad school, and I am putting up my first play <i>Spilled Milk</i> , in the New York Winterfest Theatre Festival, February 2020. But I need your help! Producing theatre--even for as short a run as this--isn't a cheap task. It takes a lot of people and resources to make the magic happen! Now a little about this work:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Spilled Milk </i>is a drama/ choreopoem that tells the story of Bobbie—a young black poet— and his five friends who are dealing with his suicide. The play takes place at the repass of Bobbie’s funeral at his childhood home. While he narrates this day and tries to make it more poetic and easier than it is, we see his friends examine grief and the validity and presence of mental illness in Bobbie’s life, as well as their own; and how they could’ve saved him and their friendship.</li>
<li>The piece deals with mental health for people of color (One of the reocurring themes in a lot of my work) and has a cast made up entirely of people of color.</li>
<li>I began writing this play in undergrad when I got incredibly depressed and needed some way to express how I was feeling and process what I was going through. Each of the friends in this play represent a different stage of grief each character's voice is used to reflect on and speak to a different aspect of my mental state while depressed. The anger, denial, confusion, etc. The piece then naturally became about mental health and my experience with it as a person of color; and how communities of color don't always acknowledge the existence of mental illness. Ultimately, this play begs the question, how do we get healthy?</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<ul>
<li>For this campaign, I am looking to raise $7500, which goes towards<ul>
<li>6 Actor Salaries</li>
<li>Rehearsal Space</li>
<li>Director</li>
<li>Stage Manager</li>
<li>Light Board Operator</li>
<li>Lighting Designer</li>
<li>Sound Designer/ Composer</li>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Set and props</li>
<li>Programs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If this goal is not met, the funds would go first to paying the actors, then rehearsal space and we would delegate from there where we could make changes and cut costs down.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I've shared this play across tables with friends old and new through different parts of the country and the thing that always rings true is that people can relate very much to the feeling of invisible pain; or being from a family or in an environment where people don't take your pain or struggle seriously if they can't physically see it. That's why I think this piece is important. We need to be seen even when the pain is ""invisible"".</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Any amount that you donate helps. And if you can't donate at the moment, please help spread the word by sharing this campaign with your friends, families, and peers. Thank you!</p>

<h3>The Violet Symphony</h3>
<p>My name is Timothy White Eagle,  I am a visual and performance artist.</p>
<p>One important way you can support this work is to share this link, like and comment on my related posts, all that helps keep this ball rolling. </p>
<p>I am in the process of creating a performance about people whom I loved and who died while in a place of deep addiction. It is a personal story, with the universal themes of release and forgiveness. The show will use a five person cast, tricksters, addicts, drag queens, a small Greek chorus, movement, story telling, sets, costumes, lighting, and music. This is the story of the sacred path of the ones that go too far.</p>
<p>I am partnering with On The Boards in Seattle to bring this show to life.  OTB, has commissioned the work in part, and will be funding many of the expense.  Unfortunately not all of the expense can be covered by OTB, I am responsible for paying my director, performers, designers and various other expenses.  The show premieres at OTB in March 2020 and will tour later that year at La Mama in NYC.  </p>
<p>With your help we can create a kind of healing theater.  Additionally your donation will help establish my career as a touring performer. I promise your donation will be well spent, on art and artists telling an important story.</p>
<p>It’s my hope that this show leaves its audience with greater compassion for those dealing with addiction, while finding peace for our memories of those who passed while addicted.  It is my hope that we can collectively as a community of artists and audiences come together and honor those imperfect loved ones and by honoring them may we relieve some of the tension in the world which drives us all to seek perfection.</p>
</div><div>
<p>I am seeking at least $5,000 in funding. Most of which will go to paying all the artists, designers and performers helping to create this show.</p>
<p>‘Thank you sincerely for anything you can offer from warm wishes to big dollars, all are welcome.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>ut patet Theater Company</i> is a Latinx artistic organization that thrives to create equal opportunities for women and Latin American artists in New York City. </p>
<p>Founded by Brazilian actors and producers <strong>Juliana Suaide</strong> and <strong>Renata Soares</strong>, <i>ut patet</i>, which means “to be clear”, is a huge step for us, as immigrants and as women, to create an outlet where we can have our own stories and ideas heard. </p>
<p>So this is what we ask of you:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>help us to give this first big step in bringing different stories to New York</strong></p> <p>We’re producing SAVANA GLACIAL, an award-winning play written by one of the most influential contemporary Brazilian playwrights, Jô Bilac. We need your financial support to make that happen. But, “to be clear”, your support really means so much more than that. </p>
<p>Having your support means that our voices and our work matter, and you’ll help us set the stage for many more productions to come. Because, oh boy, we’re just getting started!</p>
<p><strong>Let's be realistic... </strong></p>
<p>There are many challenges in living as Latinx artists in NYC - which we can tell you all about it over coffee or drinks some time - but nothing will ever make us feel any less proud of who we are or where we come from.</p>
<p>So this is where we stand. </p>
<p>This will be the first time one of Bilac’s works is produced in the United States and, as Brazilians, it’s extremely important for us to share our artistry and show that our country has much more to offer than soccer, naked women, Carnaval and a terrible President that doesn’t care about burning down the Amazon Forest. </p>
<p><strong>That it is not the </strong><strong>Brazil</strong><strong> that represents us.</strong></p>
<p>So let us show you what truly represents us. And like most Bossa Nova’s greatest hits, Savana Glacial knows exactly how to talk about pain and trauma through a poetic and fun text. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Pain and Trauma and Poetic and Fun?!</strong></p>
<p>Yep! Savana Glacial is a dark comedy that dives deep into a love triangle between a writer, his wife who suffers from short-term memory loss and their eccentric neighbor.</p>
<p><strong>In this multi-layered world full of trauma and loss, everything is fiction— except the pain.</strong></p>
<p>And there’s something beautiful about it - trauma and pain. Because there’s so much growth after we experience trauma and so much light after we feel pain. </p>
<p>The play will be directed by award-winning Brazilian director <strong>Marina Montesanti</strong>. According to Marina,</p>
<p><i>The play exposes deep layers of internal attachments, coping mechanisms, and attempts to be free again. (...) It allows us to reconsider our human condition and it’s paradox with the urban behavior and conflicts of the modern existence:  isolation, paranoia and the artificiality in relationships.</i></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">About the creators</span></strong></p>
<p>Juliana and Renata met back in Brazil in 2010 and were roommates when Renata first moved to New York in 2015. They have always shared this hunger and need to create, experiment and jump in with both feet in projects that felt right to them. So when the opportunity came to take on this challenge together, <strong>neither of them hesitated to say YES!</strong></p> <p><i>The idea of having a  theatre company here in NY has always been a great desire. There is so much waiting on the actor’s life so I always felt in need to create my own projects. I do believe great minds think alike, so this connection with Renata to just jump on board and start producing this play was something meant to happen - Projects do not get out of text messages or emails if there’s no connection between the creators.</i> - <strong>Juliana</strong></p> <p><i>One of the biggest challenges that I had to face when establishing myself as an artist in New York was finding my own community. There’s something special when you find an artistic connection that inspires and dares you to dream bigger, and I think Juliana and I do that for each other. Artists can do great things on their own but nothing compares to when you create something together.</i> - <strong>Renata </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Okay! So let’s create something together.</strong></p>

<h3>Making a cake is difficult without a mixing bowl.<br/>Living a life is difficult without mental health care.<br/>Is it too much to ask to want to have your cake and treatment?</h3>
<p>George is an actor and Sionnán is a writer. </p>
<p>We’re both storytellers,  We each have a poignant personal story involving cake,</p>
<p>And neither of us could win the battle to access treatment for our separate mental health conditions in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Instead of birthday presents for us this year we are asking for help making a show about this!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We recently devised a documentary production for Scene+Heard that explored the biochemical imbalances in our brains, the effect this has on our day-to-day routines, and the obstacles we encounter in trying to bake cakes - oh, I mean live our lives.</p>
<p>But sometimes sharing cake can make everything feel kind of ok.</p>
<p>You know, there really is an incomparable joy in feeling ok.</p> <p>We were both heartened and devastated by the stories our audience members approached us with immediately after our Scene + Heard show. </p>
<p>We know we need to take this story further.</p>
<p>Mental illness is a lonely experience.</p>
<p>Even more so when the support you need is “not currently available”.</p>
<p>We know that it can feel like a twisted contest and like there is no winning.</p>
<p>But we refuse to lose.</p>
<p>And we need to make a fuss, because no one should feel like they have to struggle alone.</p> <p>For this development phase of CAKE we are going further than exploring just our own experiences. We have a network of friends and collaborators in psychology, in culinary careers, and in therapy. And there is a lot more cross over between these areas than we realised. We’re already in talks (well, Zooms)  and are holding weekly online script-development workshops together. We’re excited about the creative solutions we’re coming up with to facilitate remote devising until it’s safe to see each other again - when we will be looking at developing it further in person!</p> <p>If you’ve any questions, or any advice or guidance for us in relation to developing our project further, do get in touch!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>For this project we need help paying for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehearsal and development space cost for two weeks; €1000</li>
<li>Printing and transport costs for interviews and rehearsals; €300 (trust us, there's a lot of paperwork!)</li>
<li>Freedom of Information (FOI) requests; €150</li>
<li>Indiegogo fees; approx €50</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why do we need to make this?</h3>
<p>We are making this for;</p>
<p>Anyone who has ever struggled to access appropriate mental health supports - and needs to know that they are not alone.</p>
<p>Anyone who is close to the above person - and who wants to understand how to support them.</p>
<p>Anyone who is a frontline mental health worker - and who is frustrated that they don’t have access to the resources they need.</p>
<p>Anyone who is responsible for the funding of mental health services - and needs to see how their decisions affect patients on the ground.</p>

<h3>Part drive-in performance, part healing cypher, this Atlanta-based multimedia Immersive Theater production tells the story of a family thrown into chaos after the death of their matriarch. </h3>
<p>Hello! We are the cast and creative team of HEREafter. Our story begins in 2017, when former <i>Sleep No More</i> cast member Kelly Bartnik launched her own Immersive Theater production <i>HERE </i>in NYC<i>.  </i>Seeing an untapped market in Atlanta, Kelly approached Kathleen Wessel, a choreographer and faculty member in the Department of Dance Performance and Choreography at Spelman College, with an idea: to build the first large-scale, long-running (Broadway model) Immersive Theater show in the Southeast. For two years, Kelly and Kathleen amassed a creative team, held workshops, plotted and planned, and eventually secured a home in the historic H.L. Green building in South Downtown Atlanta with the help of Newport Real Estate: a 10,000 square foot space that was a five and dime store in the 1950s.</p>
<p>In October 2019, we held a pop-up performance in H.L. Green, a sort of prequel to the main show and an introduction to the setting, story, and characters. Here is the full teaser:</p>
<ul></ul>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/382938885?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>We were about to start construction on the set and rehearsals with the cast when the pandemic hit and the show had to be put on hold indefinitely. </p>
<p>After much consideration, we decided to craft a different version of the show that would expand on the existing narrative while utilizing a completely new format to allow for social distancing guidelines, yet still allow the audience to become part of the show. </p>
<h3>Why Us?</h3>
<p>Kelly Bartnik is a leading expert in Immersive Theater, an original cast member of <i>Sleep No More</i>, and cast representative for the both the Boston and NYC productions. She has worked with top immersive companies and productions including Meow Wolf, Amazon Prime, Optika Moderna with La Jolla Playhouse, and Cinereal's The Unbrunch. </p>

<p>Co-Director Kathleen Wessel was a founding member of Staibdance in Atlanta and is the current director of Spelman Dance Theater. She was an associate co-director and choreographer for the <i>Georgia Incarceration Performance Project Presents: By Our Hands</i>, a devised work that explored the history of prison and convict labor in Georgia.</p>

<p>Together we <strong>devise</strong>. We do not work with an existing script but instead create character tracks, dialogue, storyline, and choreography in rehearsals as a group.  All members of the team are co-creators including set, lighting, sound, and costume designers, a set decorator, and dramaturge. </p>
<h3>Why Now?</h3>
<p><strong>#immersivetheatersowhite</strong></p>
<p>Immersive Theater is a relatively new genre in the United States and was one of the fastest growing facets of the entertainment industry before COVID-19 shook up the planet. But despite its massive rise in popularity, Immersive Theater remains a majority white art form with very few people of color performing in, consulting for, designing or leading productions. So we ask ourselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we continue to support artists and engage audiences in a pandemic?</li>
<li>How do we amplify Black voices, stories and storytellers?</li>
<li>How do we work to dismantle white supremacy in arts organizations and creative processes?</li>
<li>How do we stay true to the intimacy offered in Immersive Theater while keeping people safe?</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>#artisessentialwork</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>We turn to who we are and what we know for solace and a path forward during these confusing and difficult times. As artists, we know there is great power and possibility in the practice of listening, following our instincts, and letting one moment drive the next, leaning on the work we've done but rerouting or wholly ditching the plan when need be to make way for something better, more spontaneous, or more generous. A skyscraper needs a strong core but also the ability to sway in the wind. When a structure is too rigid, it will break.  Artists know how to change it up, bring people together, and shift perspectives.</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, Immersive Theater was thriving and expanding at exponential rates, pointing to a desire for people to engage in performance work in a more intimate and personal way.  Now that we've all been in the house for 4 months, the desire for connection and experience is even more potent.</p>
<p>We need to get off Zoom and get out of the house, y'all.  Safely.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Each pop-up performance costs about $5,000 to mount. About half of this amount goes directly to rehearsal and performance pay for the cast of six.  The remainder goes to PR, recurring props, back-of-house staffing and sound/lighting design. The July 25/26th shows are intended to be the first of several through the remainder of the summer and early fall.  Due to social distancing regulations, we have to limit the amount of audience members we can have per show.  Additionally, we want to be sure to keep the ticket prices financially accessible.  For those reasons, the amount of money we make per pop-up through ticket sales is minimal and will primarily go toward administrative costs as well as longer term investment to hopefully mount the full show when pandemic restrictions are lifted.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul></ul>
</div><div><p>At this point, the show we are crafting and the impact it will have is a mystery.  Our top priority is safety, so the work is being created with those parameters in mind first and foremost. But within those parameters, we are finding unique and interesting ways to allow audience members to engage in performance, follow a narrative, and even change location over the course of the show.  It will be an experiment that we will learn from and continue to tweak as we move forward.</p></div></div>","Part drive-in performance, part healing cypher, this Atlanta-based multimedia Immersive Theater production tells the story of a family thrown into chaos after the death of their matriarch.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>WHAT IS SHAKE THE CITY?</i></h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>'Shake The City' </strong></i><i> </i>is a play written by Millie Gaston with the Leeds community at heart, to help share the forgotten history of the Women's Liberation Movement and inspire young, northern, women.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> <i>Based on the clothworkers strike in Leeds, 1970. Wendy, Laurie, Heather and Margaret work at Burton’s Menswear Factory. On the cusp of the new decade the four women decide to start their own Women’s Liberation Movement meetings in the fight for equality and equal pay. The 90 minute play focuses on the new wave of feminism of the 1970’s and the struggles women faced and fought. Shake The City puts three dimensional, complex women centre stage using a mixture of comedy and pathos.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">2020 has the opportunity for magnificent transformation and we have the power to listen to a wider variety of voices. As well as being a historical dramatisation, the play has a social and economic comment on gender equality and the economic divide between the north and south. The play was written exactly fifty years on from the Leeds Clothworkers strike.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The show was written during the first UK lockdown. It has had two readings via zoom with two amazing groups of actors. The first zoom table read led to re-writes of the script. The second reading was part of <strong>FEVA Festival</strong> alongside <strong>Simon Armitage</strong> and <strong>Lucy Adlington</strong>. The reading was free and drew a massive live audience. This has led to the development of an R&amp;D draft for the workshops with the aim to create a rehearsal draft for an audience in 2021. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">After the uncertainty of lockdown, I have pushed to organise the workshops for 2020. I feel proud and excited to be creating work after such a challenging year. This IndieGoGo Campaign is where it really counts to fund all the freelance artists!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>WHAT WE NEED AND WHY?</i></h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I am holding a five-day R&amp;D at Leeds Playhouse to develop a script which will be produced in 2021. The workshops have been supported by Leeds Playhouse who are giving me in-kind support. The aim of the R&amp;D is to develop the script, composition, movement, design and film the work to be able to pitch to Theatres and create initial marketing ideas. Additionally, by using a videographer to film the show I will be able to send the video to theatres, producers and there is also the opportunity to share the work on-line. As I will be producing the play in 2021, the workshops are vital in discovering new ways to make the show accessible and audience friendly under new Covid-19 restrictions. The workshops will employ nine freelance creatives to continue their creative practice and develop the show.</p>

'Shake The City'  is a play written by Millie Gaston with the Leeds community at heart, to help share the forgotten history of the Women's Liberation Movement and inspire young, northern, women.
 Based on the clothworkers strike in Leeds, 1970. Wendy, Laurie, Heather and Margaret work at Burton’s Menswear Factory. On the cusp of the new decade the four women decide to start their own Women’s Liberation Movement meetings in the fight for equality and equal pay. The 90 minute play focuses on the new wave of feminism of the 1970’s and the struggles women faced and fought. Shake The City puts three dimensional, complex women centre stage using a mixture of comedy and pathos.
2020 has the opportunity for magnificent transformation and we have the power to listen to a wider variety of voices. As well as being a historical dramatisation, the play has a social and economic comment on gender equality and the economic divide between the north and south. The play was written exactly fifty years on from the Leeds Clothworkers strike.
The show was written during the first UK lockdown. It has had two readings via zoom with two amazing groups of actors. The first zoom table read led to re-writes of the script. The second reading was part of FEVA Festival alongside Simon Armitage and Lucy Adlington. The reading was free and drew a massive live audience. This has led to the development of an R&D draft for the workshops with the aim to create a rehearsal draft for an audience in 2021. 
After the uncertainty of lockdown, I have pushed to organise the workshops for 2020. I feel proud and excited to be creating work after such a challenging year. This IndieGoGo Campaign is where it really counts to fund all the freelance artists!
 
WHAT WE NEED AND WHY?
 
I am holding a five-day R&D at Leeds Playhouse to develop a script which will be produced in 2021. The workshops have been supported by Leeds Playhouse who are giving me in-kind support. The aim of the R&D is to develop the script, composition, movement, design and film the work to be able to pitch to Theatres and create initial marketing ideas. Additionally, by using a videographer to film the show I will be able to send the video to theatres, producers and there is also the opportunity to share the work on-line. As I will be producing the play in 2021, the workshops are vital in discovering new ways to make the show accessible and audience friendly under new Covid-19 restrictions. The workshops will employ nine freelance creatives to continue their creative practice and develop the show.
The script will be developed by myself and director Rob Ellis through table reads, workshopping scenes, re organisation of the script, feedback from industry professionals and a short presentation. I aim to have a rehearsal draft written from this week’s development.
         One day will be set aside to work with a composer to develop the music of the show. We aim to explore an original score and have one phrase written by the end of the week to accompany the promotional video with pitching the show. During this day, Rob Ellis, who is also a movement director, will explore the movement in the show.
         Designer, Caitlin Mawhinney will develop costume and set design ideas and help bring the world to life. She will also be responsible for creating ideas for a logo and developing ways in which we can make produce the play under new Covid-19 restrictions.
I need your help to be able to fund all the performers and creative team, especially after such a challenging year for theatre! Every donation will help go towards producing the show in 2021. I will make sure that you are taken on the plays journey and as a backer you will see how your donation helped to kick start the show.

<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting our project campaign page on Indie GoGo.</p>
<p>I am a 20-year-old resident of Luxembourg. Since this year I am directing my very own play in English. I have been taking acting classes for 8 years and recently decided to change my point of view of the stage. </p>
<p><u>Synopsis of the play:</u></p>
<p>The plot focusses on the meaning of trust and friendship, furthermore it uses the notion of reason of state and the respect for nature.

'A Shieldmaiden’s Saga' is not aiming to be historically accurate, but rather educational and entertaining.</p>
<p>The plot is about Rökia, a fisherwoman, who does not fit into her society and tries to find a way to feel accepted again.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where your money will go:</strong></p>
<p>Dear potential supporter,</p>
<p>Some of the funds we need right now will be used to pay the cinematography team who record our green screen scenes. The rest of the funds will be used to pay the carpenter workshop for creating our custom Viking round shields that every actor needs. The funds need to pay the renting of the costumes and the renting of the music studio in order to record good quality music. As the play will have an intermezzo, we had the idea to offer the spectators traditional Scandinavian food and beverages. Thus the remaining amount of the funds will be used to pay the catering. </p>

<p><strong><u>Importance of a supporter:</u></strong></p>
<p>Dear supporter,</p>
<p>We urge you to consider helping the project to fully flourish. The project is nearly ready for finalisation, however right now we have sacrificed every good will of our close friends, therefore we don't have any other choice than to ask you to financially support us. </p>
<p>The play has a real potential and once fully completed and having the final video of the whole performance in my grasp, then that will be a remarkable day in everyone's life who participated in this project and believed in my idea.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Obstacles that we have managed</strong></p>
<p>As already mentioned, I am the stage director, however I am also the author and script writer of the play. In addition, I manage marketing and the advertisement campaign. Of course, I am the head of communication as well. And if this is not enough already, I am also composing the music for the play.</p>
<p>There is a lot that needs constant oversight in order to quickly react and adapt if obstacles occur. At the beginning of this year we had sort of a safe haven in the rehearsal rooms of my former high school. Everything was fine, but then Covid-19 made an appearance and everything was closed down. This was the first big obstacle, which we managed pretty quickly as I created a Discord server on which the rehearsals were held via online format.</p>
<p>Next bad surprise, the association that let us use the rehearsal rooms in the high school, did not want to know how we dealt with the situation as the schools were still closed down. When the government was discussing their deconfinement strategy, I immediately with all the necessary precautions asked different kinds of theatre houses, if some of them would let us in to rehearse. Still there was no curiosity from that first association. After a lot of trial and decline, one theatre house invited us in to rehearse and even play the final performances for free. As soon as I told my friends that the Shieldmaiden's Saga has not yet died, the first association began writing a complaint, that I would not have respected the terms and they decided to not further support the project anymore. Until this day I am still certain, that Covid-19 was the contract breaker and not me.</p>
<p>During the last few weeks, everybody is working as they should and according to the productivity we are on schedule and will be ready to perform in September.</p>

Dear reader,
Thank you for visiting our project campaign page on Indie GoGo.

The play has a real potential and once fully completed and having the final video of the whole performance in my grasp, then that will be a remarkable day in everyone's life who participated in this project and believed in my idea.
 
Our Obstacles that we have managed
As already mentioned, I am the stage director, however I am also the author and script writer of the play. In addition, I manage marketing and the advertisement campaign. Of course, I am the head of communication as well. And if this is not enough already, I am also composing the music for the play.
There is a lot that needs constant oversight in order to quickly react and adapt if obstacles occur. At the beginning of this year we had sort of a safe haven in the rehearsal rooms of my former high school. Everything was fine, but then Covid-19 made an appearance and everything was closed down. This was the first big obstacle, which we managed pretty quickly as I created a Discord server on which the rehearsals were held via online format.

We chose Jonas Hassen Khemiri’s 2011 Obie award winning play ""INVASION!"" as our so called map in the quest. Jonas' play gives people an opportunity to momentarily forget their individual identities and share in an experience of what is rooted in humanity.

The story follows two American teenagers, Yousef (Gopal Divan) and Arvind (Aman Soni), as they navigate racial stereotypes and hip-hop culture in New York. INVASION! uses American politics as fodder for comedy, but the play is much more deeply rooted in philosophy than any particular political ideology. It reveals the subtle ways in which people trick themselves into dehumanizing others, and highlights the very real challenges of living together peacefully in a multicultural society.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440392506/ldbfejdsappcr063pblr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><br/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>WHY IT'S RELEVANT</b></h3><p>With the influx of immigrants from all over the world to the US and western Europe at an all-time-high, INVASION! provides a crucial perspective that must be heard.

Drama Wallah is a newly-formed group of international artists who seek to break down the social, religious, racial, and ethnic barriers that divide people, and create something truly unique and undeniably human. We chose Jonas Hassen Khemiri’s 2011 Obie award winning play ""INVASION!"" as our so called map in the quest. Jonas' play gives people an opportunity to momentarily forget their individual identities and share in an experience of what is rooted in humanity. Drama Wallah was founded by actor/playwright Aman Soni and director Hafiz Karmali and is in collaboration for this production of ""Invasion!"" with cast members Gopal Divan, Jackson Goldberg, Mahima Saigal. THE STORYThe play is performed by an ensemble of four actors who each play five or more different characters. The story follows two American teenagers, Yousef (Gopal Divan) and Arvind (Aman Soni), as they navigate racial stereotypes and hip-hop culture in New York. INVASION! uses American politics as fodder for comedy, but the play is much more deeply rooted in philosophy than any particular political ideology. It reveals the subtle ways in which people trick themselves into dehumanizing others, and highlights the very real challenges of living together peacefully in a multicultural society.WHY IT'S RELEVANTWith the influx of immigrants from all over the world to the US and western Europe at an all-time-high, INVASION! provides a crucial perspective that must be heard. The humor and irreverence that Khemiri uses so well allows the audience to feel included in this great endeavor, and that is why the play is effective and has the potential to change perspectives: it both implicates and includes everyone.                    THEATER FOR THE NEW CITYSince its inception, 'TNC' has presented powerful works that have won a total of 43 Obie Awards, as well as the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for Sam Shepard’s Buried Child. Theatre for the New City has served as the home for theatre pioneers such as Richard Foreman, Charles Ludlam, Miguel Piñero, Ralph Lee, María Irene Fornés, Harvey Forbes Fierstein, and Heiner Muller. We would like nothing more than to continue this tradition of creating inspiring new work that challenges the traditional parameters of theatre.THE CAST

<p>Imitation of a Performance of Life is a new play by Tiffany Osedra Miller.  In collaboration with Peggy Gould and Michael Rogers, the evening-length work will be presented in its premier production by NYC’s Dixon Place on Tuesday, March 17, 2015.  With this unique opportunity provided by Dixon Place, Miller and Gould have convened a company of nine players to bring the project to life via a mix of theater, dancing and music.  It is a culmination of many years’ work by Miller as a visionary writer and visual artist, in conversation with Gould and Rogers.</p>
<p>Themes of motherhood, daughterhood, restless spirits, racial identity, choice and chance permeate the carnivalesque and dreamlike world of the play, which arose specifically from decades of critical dialogue between Miller and her collaborators.  The rich imagery that features so strongly in all of Miller’s work, situates this piece squarely in the fluid temporality of a utopian universe steeped in Caribbean sensibility as it collides with the brutalities of life in its many layers.  Burlesque collides with post-modern and tap dancing;  Racialized rhetoric encounters resistance through exaggeration and parody.  Love finds its way in and around obsession.  And the fun is there for the taking.</p>
<p>The show has four acts, with an overture and epilogue, and features dancing, music and text interwoven throughout.  The company is currently in rehearsal with cast featuring Gould, Rogers, Chicava HoneyChild, Lea “BC Love” Bempah, Clarissa Marie Ligon, Genie Adagio, Anneke Hansen, Ashley Handel and Patrick Gallagher.  Lighting designer Kathy Kaufmann, photographer Bryan Fox, videographer Peter Richards and production stage manager Chloe Czinsky round out the production team for this event. </p>
<p>We are seeking to raise a minimum of $3000, to help cover fees for artistic and technical personnel, rehearsal studio rental, video documentation and modest production costs.  Revenue raised beyond our minimum fundraising goal will be used to cover production expenses ($5800 total).  Revenue raised beyond total production expenses will be shared among all members of the production team, to more fully compensate everyone for the work that is being put in. </p>
<p>Sincere thanks for considering this request for support.  Hoping to see you at Dixon Place!</p>

<p>Our newest work is “Memory Lapse” which will be performed to an

its loss can mean a loss of identity, our relationships, loves and abilities.
The act of recollection is just that, to collect the memory in your mind again.

“thinking really hard?” Memory is physical, emotional, physiological, practical
and necessary. We need our memory for daily life, for practical tasks as well
as to keep us functioning and independent. I examine this topic from several
points of view: short-term memory loss; trying to remember; Alzheimers;
remembering one’s past self. This piece is both a journey and a glimpse of our memory.
Memories can be vestiges of our reality, like a lingering impression of a scent
or trying to recall the exact color of the sky in October, the mere feeling of
trying to remember. Alternatively, it can be a definable concrete absence, a
hole in the fabric of ones mind.  Memory
Lapse will be premiered at Diavolo Performance Space this April.</p>

<br/></div>","Our Project
Please help support Clairobscur Dance Company and the
creation of Artistic Director and Choreographer Laurie Sefton’s new work
“Memory Lapse.”
Clairobscur Dance Company is an award winning, issued based
concert dance company that creates work where issues are viewed through an
emotional lens. 
Our newest work is “Memory Lapse” which will be performed to an
emotional score by composer Bryan Kostors. Memory is a reflection of our past;
its loss can mean a loss of identity, our relationships, loves and abilities.
The act of recollection is just that, to collect the memory in your mind again.

The Impact
We work across borders to establish community for change, recognizing the interplay between art-and policy-making. This year we will begin the process by:
Establishing greater dialogue between local theatre artists and migrant
communities in the Rio Grande Valley around issues of migration/immigration in order to create theatre and enable change.
Increasing awareness of legacies of
racial violence in the U.S. for future advocacy to address this history of
abuse. 
Contributing to the field of peace
mediation through practice-based research on building a community of support to
those involved in resolving conflicts.
Building a network of people
dedicated to exploring issues of gender to promote greater understanding,
tolerance, and inclusivity.

<span></span>RealSpace Theatre's  mandate is to push the boundaries of traditional theatre by exploring environmental integration and offering the audience an engaging performance. In partnering with local communities via non-traditional venues, RealSpace Theatre offers a customized, one-of-a-kind experience that reinterprets the audience’s relationship to those environments. </div><div>In addition to integrating the   venue with the storyline and the show itself with the host community,   RealSpace Theatre is renowned for its commitment to mentoring. <i>Dine Her</i>   has provided   actors as young as eight years old with an opportunity to be directed,   choreographed and perform. In its last production, their   16 year old assistant stage manager learned   the ropes by   working alongside   a veteran stage   manager.

<br/><h3><b>Why is <i>Dine Her</i> important to us?</b></h3>
</div><div>
<p>This show has been embraced by audiences (and diner owners) in each short run, in each city we've produced it; people love this new theatre experience - one that is unique and fun and where they are part of the action. We think there is an exciting opportunity to bring Dine Her to a broader audience - to engage more people in something interactive..something that changes the way we look at spaces we live, work and play in,  something that ties communities and businesses together - in Niagara Falls in the summer of 2015. </p>

</div></div>","RealSpace Brings hit show Dine Her to Niagara Falls for a limited run

RealSpace Theatre's  mandate is to push the boundaries of traditional theatre by exploring environmental integration and offering the audience an engaging performance. In partnering with local communities via non-traditional venues, RealSpace Theatre offers a customized, one-of-a-kind experience that reinterprets the audience’s relationship to those environments. In addition to integrating the   venue with the storyline and the show itself with the host community,   RealSpace Theatre is renowned for its commitment to mentoring. Dine Her   has provided   actors as young as eight years old with an opportunity to be directed,   choreographed and perform. In its last production, their   16 year old assistant stage manager learned   the ropes by   working alongside   a veteran stage   manager.



Why is Dine Her important to us?

This show has been embraced by audiences (and diner owners) in each short run, in each city we've produced it; people love this new theatre experience - one that is unique and fun and where they are part of the action. We think there is an exciting opportunity to bring Dine Her to a broader audience - to engage more people in something interactive..something that changes the way we look at spaces we live, work and play in,  something that ties communities and businesses together - in Niagara Falls in the summer of 2015. 
To promote Dine Her as widely as possible - to share the show with as many people as possible - we need your help. 
Contributors will help get the word out to audiences of all ages, all walks of life, who are looking for an entertainment experience that is both loads of fun and thought provoking; more people will engage with art, ideas and others in a singularly special evening out.  What Dine Her isDine Her is love story gone awry. Imagine waiting for your boyfriend for over an hour and a half, only to be dished out a ridiculous story about a zombie invasion. Audiences of Dine Her sit alongside Tim & Liz as they sort out their relationship and the weird and wonderful situations that ensue. Warning: there is a great deal of comedy. You will laugh A LOT.

What We Need & What You Get

We need $8,000 to make sure we can tell audiences - locals, tourists, individuals, businesses - on both sides of the border - that this unique experience is happening. From there we hope the word will spread like a good zombie virus.

</div></div>","On Impulse! . . . it started out as an experiment and then . . . IT GREW!!

When Emmy-Nominated Producer/Director and teacher Pamela Peak was asked, five years ago, to take a room full of every-day business folks, who had always longed to act since they were little kids, and turn them into fabulous actors that Disney's animation department would find ""improvisational and free"", no one knew  that they were about to bond like a family and become one of the most well thought of acting troupes in Orange County, California known as On Impulse!
Be sure to see the memorable video clips of several On Impulse performances at the bottom of this page.
FIRST, THESE ACTORS ALL GOT THEMSELVES HIGHLY TRAINED!!!
The actors all got themselves trained fully in the brilliant acting technique of the great Sandford Meisner (Teacher to Robert Duval, Sandra Bullock, Steve McQueen and so many more).

Now, the highly skilled On Impulse actors are known to touch their audiences deeply—to make them laugh, cry and sit on the very edge of their seat . . . all in one incredible live theater performance!
They dedicate themselves, in each performance, to taking their audiences on an emotional journey, using real emotions—an exciting journey their audiences will never forget.
A HOMELESS TROUPE?
Being a ""Homeless troupe"", On Impulse loved their art so much that they've dug deep into their own pockets, year after year, in order get their theater company started.
Not having a theater to perform in, On Impulse has played in just about every venue you can think of—from Historical Parks to funky saloon-like barrooms, spooky old Victorian Houses to gorgeous Orange County beachfront mansions. And they tailor-made their performances for whatever venue they played in.

BUT they have always longed simply to play in an actual theater!
NOW . . . A TEMPORARY HOME!!
Now, On Impulse has been given a short-term ""temporary home"" at the historic Cabrillo Playhouse in San Clemente, California and . . . they have BIG THINGS PLANNED!
 
THREE FABULOUS PLAYS in Just Two Months
On Impulse has been very busy preparing to put on the three major productions described below in just two months of performances.

</h3> <p>1. <b>We Need To Pay Our Performers!</b>: While we're honored to have the chance to work in such well-respected venues, sadly each only offers a very modest stipend with which we cannot realistically pay all our performers.

<p>2. <b>The Other Stuff</b>: We will have a few new performers and acts in the new incarnations of the show. Therefore tailoring and creating new costuming will be necessary.

</div></div>","ABOUT THE SHOW
 
Scheherazade
 is no longer a Queen staving off execution by her cruel husband but a 
woman condemned to death by the criminal justice system.
1001 Nights: Love Stories on Death Row (A Rock Ballet)
 is a feast for all five senses featuring stories from the Middle East, 
North Africa, India, China and Greece and an original musical score 
consisting of Hip Hop, Rock and World Music.
We
 will explore what it means to be the ""minority"" in terms of ethnicity, 
religion, sex and sexual orientation within Western and Eastern cultures
 and take a critical look at the American prison-industrial complex. 
The work has been picked up by renowned, downtown theatres in NYC such as Dixon Place and Theatre for the New City for Spring/Summer 2015. The work has also been honored with a residency at the Jamaica Performing Arts Center. During our residency we will further develop the production and continue to fulfill our collective’s mission statement by offering free (donation optional) dance classes, open rehearsals, outdoor performances and a workshop in community building.

ABOUT THE COLLECTIVE
Formed in March 2011, The Kandake Dance Theatre for Social Change
combines social activism and philanthropy with folkloric, modern, 
theatrical and experimental movement. The collective embraces talented 
performers of various ethnicities, religious (or non-religious) 
backgrounds, sexual orientations and gender identities. The Kandake 
stays active in the community by hosting free and ""no one turned away 
for lack of funds"" shows, street art and workshops.
  WHY WE NEED YOU!
 1. We Need To Pay Our Performers!: While we're honored to have the chance to work in such well-respected venues, sadly each only offers a very modest stipend with which we cannot realistically pay all our performers. First and foremost we want to make sure the performers are compensated well for their time, energy and heart. Helping us reach or exceed our fundraising goal will ensure this (and you'll get cool prizes too!)
2. The Other Stuff: We will have a few new performers and acts in the new incarnations of the show. Therefore tailoring and creating new costuming will be necessary. We also have some beautiful new post cards (which we will be revealing gradually here!) that have to be printed. Last --but definitely not least-- we want to make sure our audiences are well taken care of at our outdoor events, workshops and etc. This means providing yummy and healthy refreshments! Helping us reach or exceed our goal will make it all possible and some!
  SO ARE WE REALLY MAKING A BETTER WORLD OR WHAT?
Our ultimate goal as a dance theatre for social change is to 
bring about a more compassionate, just and healthy society by exposing diverse communities to the healing and inspiring power of arts and culture. A huge part 
of this is creating spaces for discussion, sharing, learning, 
creativity, inspiration and fun among many different people.
Systemic injustices, including but 
not limited to those within the criminal justice system, hit close to 
home every day. The larger artistic work calls 
attention to these injustices while the accompanying community 
engagement projects provide a tangible approach to addressing it.
Awareness can lead to more harmonious communities locally and 
internationally but it is nothing without action and change from the 
inside of an individual or community outward. We aim to pay it forward.

<div style=""text-indent: 3em;"">The first act, Jack, is a story about a boy who has locked himself in a box and no-one really knows why.

<div>
<p>Our company, PeachPie Productions is our company that started in San Francisco in 2012. We've taken our show on the road and  We want to seek out new plays in  and theatre concepts in New York City to develop innovative, experiential performances. Our work will often involve modern and contemporary dance, improvisation and experimental-meets-narrative material. Our first show tries to do just that and establish our company as a home for innovative and unique storytelling. </p>

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are seeking 7,000 Dollars to help us start our company off and produce our first show! This will offset the 600 dollars for costumes, 1000 for lighting, 150 for sound, 400 for sets, 500 for a dance floor, 500 for rehearsal spaces, 400 for props, 1000 for actor stipends and 4000 for space rental,</p>
<p>Check out the donation levels on the right for some of the fantastic perks that we'd like to give to those who donate to our fund!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:</p> <ul> <li>We want to show a less staid and less film-influenced side of theater.</li>
<li>So much of theater's uniqueness comes from it's ability to reach it's audience directly. Our shows are going to do that, by providing the audience a chance to be immersed in a story and be able to feel, smell and explore another world.</li> <li>PeachPie has done one show in San Francisco and it sold out the entire weekend at the Joe Goode Annex theater in the Mission District. The show raised several thousand </li> <li>We need help to maintain the quality of this show and future shows. We forsee a lean, forward thinking, new work theater that brings a needed dimension to narrative storytelling in New York City.</li> </ul>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> We are sure we will face more challenges.  Any live theater is risky, as we have to get people to not only come, but also spread the word friend to friend. If we can't get butts in seats we could be in a lot of trouble. It's also always risky when we can't pay our actors more than a stipend, which means that when they book paying work we have to let them pursue their career.</p> <ul> <li>However, we have many people in the show who are all pulling to get friends, family and strangers to come see their amazing work</li>
<li>Our actors, designers and friends are all helping to get the word out to make this play a success.</li> <li>We've also had a couple actors leave, but the beauty of New York, is that someone is always looking for a new opportunity.</li> </ul>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you cannot share financially, we need help with other things as well!</p> <ul> <li>We need help building sets, costuming, propping, selling tickets and ushering!</li> <li>Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>

Summary

For our first show in New York, we are producing two original one-act narrative plays that are performed in a completely immersive and interactive theater space at DCTV in Tribeca.
The first act, Jack, is a story about a boy who has locked himself in a box and no-one really knows why. Every family member and friend comes to the box to confess something they know about him or something that they have done that they believe has driven him in the box. Things get more frantic as days turn into nights and Jack is still in the box and lead to a collision of family and friends that leave Jack changed forever.
Act 2 is about a young housewife who, P.S., deals drugs on the side. She is troubled by the potential loss of the PTA and, oh right, she accidentally killed three kids in the neighborhood with a bad batch. With her dreams, which are written by a hollywood production team, fighting to push her to assert herself with the PTA, things head to an explosive, hilarious, and unexpected finish.
The night will be an experience rather than just a performance, where the guests get buzzed on whiskey and wine with the characters as they peruse around a storybook 1950's southern setting which they then follow into a foggy dreamscape. Guests will have 45 minutes to peruse the space, look at the character's personal effects and enjoy cocktails (with the purchase of the Complementary Open Bar) 'Bottled Up' is a show where narrative meets experimental--and with an open bar full of aged liquor. The two shows are short dark comedies and in between the two acts there will be music, drinking, dancing, and a drastic change of scenery.

Our work will often involve modern and contemporary dance, improvisation and experimental-meets-narrative material. Our first show tries to do just that and establish our company as a home for innovative and unique storytelling. 
Location:
DCTV TriBeCa, 1st floor
87 Lafayette Street
New York, NY 10013
Dates:
May 29th, 30th, 31st
June 5th, 6th and 7th
Check below for the link to tickets and times!

  What We Need & What You Get We are seeking 7,000 Dollars to help us start our company off and produce our first show! This will offset the 600 dollars for costumes, 1000 for lighting, 150 for sound, 400 for sets, 500 for a dance floor, 500 for rehearsal spaces, 400 for props, 1000 for actor stipends and 4000 for space rental,
Check out the donation levels on the right for some of the fantastic perks that we'd like to give to those who donate to our fund!

    The Impact Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:  We want to show a less staid and less film-influenced side of theater.
So much of theater's uniqueness comes from it's ability to reach it's audience directly. Our shows are going to do that, by providing the audience a chance to be immersed in a story and be able to feel, smell and explore another world. PeachPie has done one show in San Francisco and it sold out the entire weekend at the Joe Goode Annex theater in the Mission District. The show raised several thousand  We need help to maintain the quality of this show and future shows. We forsee a lean, forward thinking, new work theater that brings a needed dimension to narrative storytelling in New York City. 
   Risks & Challenges  We are sure we will face more challenges.  Any live theater is risky, as we have to get people to not only come, but also spread the word friend to friend. If we can't get butts in seats we could be in a lot of trouble. It's also always risky when we can't pay our actors more than a stipend, which means that when they book paying work we have to let them pursue their career.  However, we have many people in the show who are all pulling to get friends, family and strangers to come see their amazing work
Our actors, designers and friends are all helping to get the word out to make this play a success. We've also had a couple actors leave, but the beauty of New York, is that someone is always looking for a new opportunity. 
   Other Ways You Can Help If you cannot share financially, we need help with other things as well!  We need help building sets, costuming, propping, selling tickets and ushering! Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools!

contemporary descendants in Africa and America. Through their noncompliance to
both gravity and Euro-American standards of beauty, black women’s hair has

The Hawaii Burlesque Festival & Revue is an annual event committed to sharing the “Art of the Tease” with our Hawaii audience! Now in our 4th sparking year, the HBF has become a serious platform to showcase our outstanding home-grown Burlesque, Cabaret and Vaudeville performers. “The Hawaii Burlesque Festival & Revue” has also historically offered educational opportunities for kama’aina in the form of film screenings, talks, classes, symposiums and more!
“The Hawaii Burlesque Festival & Revue” is honored to have featured over 50 Hawaii, Pacific Rim, US Mainland and International Burlesque & Cabaret Performers on the Doris Duke Theatre Stage. We’re happily committed to fostering a wonderful exchange of knowledge and friendship with performers around the world, while providing our visitors & audiences alike a unique view into what makes Hawaii no ka oi!

</h1><div>In 2015-2016, The Shelter will debut three new full length plays all written by Shelter writers faithfully engaging in what The Shelter holds most dear: re-imagining an original work, exploring new avenues of collaboration, or workshopping at Shelter Sunday—our free, weekly workshop for theatrical artists. <i>Night of the Living</i>, <i>Trapper</i>, and <i>The Red Room</i> are not only great examples of the values and work we encourage at The Shelter, but are also the best and the brightest New York theatre has to offer this season. At The Shelter this is <b>The Year of the Writer</b>. <br/>
</div><div><br/></div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3><div>
<p></p>
<p> Shelter Sunday, our weekly developmental workshop, has supported over 300 artists since 2009 and costs just under $5000 annually to sustain. The work from Shelter Sunday gets its first breath in front of an audience via our quarterly series, THE SHELTER PEEP SHOW; the series supports between 80-120 artists per season and costs around $1500 annually to produce. And our three main stage presentations this year will cost a combined $40,000 to produce.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, ticket sales from these productions cover less than fifty percent of our total costs. While we have been applauded for our fiscal responsibility and our ability to operate on a shoestring budget we can’t do it without donors like you.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>The Impact </b></h3>
</div><div> <ul> <li>Like most not-for profit theatre companies more than fifty percent of our funding comes from generous donors like you. Your donation will make our seventh season possible.<br/>
</li>
<li>All three plays scheduled for production in 2015-2016 tackle topics important to our cultural narrative and discussion: the purpose of marriage, the myth of female hysteria, and restorative justice. Without your donation these plays will not have the life they so readily deserve. <br/>
</li>
<li>Having successfully produced seven seasons of independent theatre in New York City, our all-volunteer staff is capable of stretching every dollar much further than many of our peers.  We have minimal overhead and allocate over 95% of our funds towards the production of theatre.<br/>
</li>
<li>Since 2009, The Shelter has been building a collaborative and constructive environment for the development of artists and theatre. Your donation will ensure that programs like Shelter Sunday and <i>The Shelter Peep Show</i> continue to foster artistic talent and theatrical excellence.<br/>

<p>The Shelter is more than a theatre company. We are a community. The core
 of our community is our weekly Shelter Sunday workshop— the creative 
home to some of theatre’s most exciting writers, directors and 
actors. Shelter Sunday is a vibrant and galvanizing playground for 
our artists. It breeds collaborations and creative collisions, and it’s 
also the epicenter for our play development and production process. 
Since 2009, Shelter Artists, along with our all-volunteer staff, 
have created and staged over 100 world premieres.<br/></p>

  Like most not-for profit theatre companies more than fifty percent of our funding comes from generous donors like you. Your donation will make our seventh season possible.

Having successfully produced seven seasons of independent theatre in New York City, our all-volunteer staff is capable of stretching every dollar much further than many of our peers.  We have minimal overhead and allocate over 95% of our funds towards the production of theatre.

Workshops, discussions and social events to help build a community and challenge students intellectually and artistically.

<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Thank you for taking the time to look into my campaign. I hope I'll make it worth your while :)</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I currently live in Greece, where I shan't be staying for much longer, as it's nearly impossible to find a job that would start my a life, let alone the career of my dreams. </span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Before I do that though, there's one last thing I need to do &amp; that's complete my ballet training. If I manage to exploit the 8 upcoming months, I shall collect the ultimate certification for ballet dancing skill by the Royal Academy of Dance. Plus, I'll also get to keep the actual dancing skill itself... :) </span></div>
<div>Having this certification (and the skill that should come with it) I'll be in the position not only to dance better, but also to<span style=""background-color: initial;""> teach dance and support myself doing something I love. </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Dancing is what I've been doing my entire life &amp; having survived financial struggles in the past I find it impossible to give up hope now that I've come this far. Especially since tuition fees at my dance school are so low that it becomes a crime keeping out of such a life benefit.</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">My family is not in the position to help me, either. My dad is a cab driver, barely making enough to support the four of us without any luxuries. </span></div>
<div>For the past 4 years God, the Spirits, &amp; the Universe have made it so, that short-term job opportunities came out of the blue and helped me cover all tuition expenses. I worked as a care taker of a special needs child,  a private tutor of English to children &amp; adults, and a tutor of Greek as well. I've been a secretary at a dance school and a columnist in a website, too. All of these job opportunities came from nowhere, &amp; i believe them to have been divine intervention helping me realize my dream. </div>
<div>This year, however, I start with zero savings, a 900euro debt &amp; not a job opportunity to be seen. Not even one of those offering 3 euros per hour... When it comes down to it, all I need is another divine intervention. And, as I've learned it always comes from the place you least expect it. I've sent Cvs all over, and I've posted work ads on the streets, &amp; in shops. I've built a good number of professional profiles, &amp; I've put the word around, giving professional cards. I have done everything I could think of, &amp; it somehow got that I'm doing this now, too. </div>
</div><div>
<div>I need 800 euros, out of which 500 will cover full tuition for 8 months, the 200 will cover exam fees going to Royal Academy and 100 will go for ballet shoes. Transportation is still a cost for unemployed people in my city, and ballet shoes will definitely call for more expenses than listed, but i'm hopeful I'll be able to get this myself...</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">For whoever knows astrology, I'm a Pisces, Scorpio rising. This means I'm a dreamer in the armor of a warrior. I dream big and I have all necessary determination &amp; drive to do all it takes to make my dream come true. In the process I like to encourage and inspire others to do the same. I believe pursuing dreams does a lot for a person's soul, while it helps us maintain healthy relationships with the people in our lives too!</span></div>

The Story

Dear Contributors

Thank you for taking the time to look into my campaign. I hope I'll make it worth your while :)
I currently live in Greece, where I shan't be staying for much longer, as it's nearly impossible to find a job that would start my a life, let alone the career of my dreams. 
Before I do that though, there's one last thing I need to do & that's complete my ballet training. If I manage to exploit the 8 upcoming months, I shall collect the ultimate certification for ballet dancing skill by the Royal Academy of Dance. Plus, I'll also get to keep the actual dancing skill itself... :) 
Having this certification (and the skill that should come with it) I'll be in the position not only to dance better, but also to teach dance and support myself doing something I love. 

Dancing is what I've been doing my entire life & having survived financial struggles in the past I find it impossible to give up hope now that I've come this far. Especially since tuition fees at my dance school are so low that it becomes a crime keeping out of such a life benefit.
My family is not in the position to help me, either. My dad is a cab driver, barely making enough to support the four of us without any luxuries. 
For the past 4 years God, the Spirits, & the Universe have made it so, that short-term job opportunities came out of the blue and helped me cover all tuition expenses. I worked as a care taker of a special needs child,  a private tutor of English to children & adults, and a tutor of Greek as well. I've been a secretary at a dance school and a columnist in a website, too. All of these job opportunities came from nowhere, & i believe them to have been divine intervention helping me realize my dream. 
This year, however, I start with zero savings, a 900euro debt & not a job opportunity to be seen. Not even one of those offering 3 euros per hour... When it comes down to it, all I need is another divine intervention. And, as I've learned it always comes from the place you least expect it. I've sent Cvs all over, and I've posted work ads on the streets, & in shops. I've built a good number of professional profiles, & I've put the word around, giving professional cards.

This project is valuable to the contributor, because it comes from my heart. I see it as part of a larger scheme that promotes beauty and love in this world. I don't believe I'm naive in wanting to achieve something that seems out of reach right now. Having the instinct to pursue something seemingly unreachable is my divine path and obligation. I don't think I ever had a choice & I don't believe there's an escape. Sometimes i wish there was...


But I see all the people that have dreamed of something with the same intensity and self-denial as me, & they're the best I know!! They're the only people I know willing to give all they have unconditionally, and, to a great extent, they're the ones who helped me be a better me. Even more so than my parents in many cases!


I believe the world needs more of those people, and I want to be one of them too. But in order to give the best I have, I need to have the best in my very hands, and I need help to do that. And though never before have I campaigned for money, these great artists in my life have definitely taught me sponsorship. 

My determination once caught the eye of a dear friend who started giving me vocal lessons for free. It, then, caught the eye of an old singing teacher who ran a long lasting career as an opera singer in worldwide scale. I've had financial conveniences from both of them with occasional free classes, or very small payments. I've also managed to get a degree in Harmony, for very small tuition, since another good friend gave me free theory and piano lessons, too...

Still, dancing seems like something I cannot do for free right now, & though music is my heart and soul, dancing is too! And I do not want to give up on any one of my loves, especially when I'm so close to making it fly! 
If you are a person who can help in some small way, please don't let a love die, because of a temporary barrier. Love is always a two way street, and I ensure my success will always be about giving back to people the help, inspiration and support I got from people. It's all I sing and dance for...

Risks & Challenges 

 As far as dance is concerned my #1 challenge has always been my difficult body. I'm not naturally flexible, I have bumpy knees & not a hint of curve on my arches.

LCS is a play where in itself are 3 original mini-one-woman shows.  3 great friends have a holiday season get-together and naturally the conversation turns to childhood ""Christmas Dramas.""

</div><b>Hear Your Heart Beat; <i>""Follow Your Heart""</i><br/></b><p><b>A Middle Eastern story that comes from the heart</b></p><b></b><p><b>Who we Are:</b></p>
<p><b>Evolution Dance Theatre (aka EDT)</b> is a Canadian federally registered not-for-profit
company that develops, promotes and performs original Middle Eastern inspired
multimedia and multidisciplinary spectacles. Founded by Artistic and Executive
Director, Armineh Keshishian, the stories entertain and provoke dialogue on
social, spiritual and humanistic themes that have universal appeal. The core values are Unity, Universality and
Integrity. To find out more visit our <a href=""http://www.evolutiondt.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website here</a>.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444675919/y3k1bk6cy4va3fi2zjoo.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 255.036px; height: 385px;""/></p>For Keshishian, dance is an outlet that
has allowed her to celebrate her life journey and foster greater understanding
of complex cultural issues. Finding her way to the stage, Keshishian’s passion
for dance and performance began as a young child and has grown into an
extensive performing and choreographic career spanning more than twenty years.
Additionally, Keshishian brings the discipline and skills she practices daily
in her professional life as a Certified Financial Planner to her role as the
visionary behind the multimedia
productions she has created and produced.

<blockquote>
<b></b><p>“My work is influenced by the context of my upbringing; I
was born Christian and raised in a Muslim country and this has given me an
insight into these two different worlds, of what is allowed and what is not.
Because I did not want to follow the traditional rules and regulations as a
socially obliging Middle Eastern girl I went on to find my path as an artist
and as a woman who can express herself” says Keshishian. She adds; “I strive to
create cultural fusion through art. I like to tell current Middle Eastern
stories that have universal appeal. My aim is to bring people and cultures
together by focusing on our commonalities vs. our differences.”</p>
</blockquote><b>
</b><p><b>Our Current Production:</b></p>
<p><b><i>Follow Your Heart</i></b> is about a modern Middle Eastern woman, Almaza, who
is in love with a traditional man, Jivan.<span> 
Their love is irresistible, yet doomed as he is bound by tradition and
his culture. It is a journey of a woman
who fights for love against all odds, against her culture and traditions. What
starts as a love story of taboo and tradition in Toronto travels to Middle East
and back again, to end up in a world where other cultures and traditions join
in to help their love prevail.  </span></p>
<p>This story showcases a fusion
of global heritage, and yet allows you to experience the real
Middle Eastern culture; one that is so mysterious to many of the Western world. It questions traditional values, matriarchal
archetypes, hidden motifs and desires.<span> 
It unveils love, power, suppression and desire! <br/></span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444675679/uplj66qxdnnsfqtukzzf.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 251.525px; height: 360px;""/></p><span></span><b>Where We Are: </b>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Okay...So this is your chance to be an <i>Off Off</i> Broadway producer.</span></p>
<p>This is a BIG flippin' DEAL!</p>
<p>The Off Off Broadway Festival (OOB), Manhattan's oldest continuous short play festival, features  work from the freshest playwrights in the country.  Hugely popular, the Festival has launched the careers of many major contemporary dramatists, including such notables as Theresa Rebeck, Steve Yockey, and Rachel Bonds. We are thrilled to be included.</p>
<p>This year, the festival received over 1500 submissions  from more than six countries - the largest submission pool ever! From those 1500 plays the <b><i>Final 30</i></b>  were chosen as semi-finalists in the 2015 40th Anniversary OOB Festival. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our play, LUCKY NUMBERS made it to the </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>Final 30</i></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">T</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">he <b><i>Final 30</i></b>  plays are performed over 4 nights at the East 13th Street Theater in NYC.

<p></p>
<p>Many of you will remember Gwen's fascinating play, THE GRIOTS, presented last year at RTW inaugural Br!NK program. LUCKY NUMBERS is another compelling piece; a touching drama about an
actuary who begins to doubt the power of statistics and mathematical
probability as he and his wife prepare for the birth of their first child.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Neither of them could have predicted how the pregnancy will change their lives forever. We believe LUCKY NUMBERS can win, and we need Producers to make it happen.</span></p>

Ever dream of being a  Broadway Producer?!  Well, Here's your chance!
This August 5th (That's right! Less than a month away!) Renaissance Theaterworks is producing  the world premiere of LUCKY NUMBERS, a powerful new play by Gwendolyn Rice for Samuel French's prestigious Off Off Broadway Short Play Festival in NEW YORK CITY! 
Okay...So this is your chance to be an Off Off Broadway producer.
This is a BIG flippin' DEAL!
The Off Off Broadway Festival (OOB), Manhattan's oldest continuous short play festival, features  work from the freshest playwrights in the country.  Hugely popular, the Festival has launched the careers of many major contemporary dramatists, including such notables as Theresa Rebeck, Steve Yockey, and Rachel Bonds. We are thrilled to be included.
This year, the festival received over 1500 submissions  from more than six countries - the largest submission pool ever! From those 1500 plays the Final 30  were chosen as semi-finalists in the 2015 40th Anniversary OOB Festival. Our play, LUCKY NUMBERS made it to the Final 30. The Final 30  plays are performed over 4 nights at the East 13th Street Theater in NYC. At the end of the week, 6 winning plays are chosen for Samuel French representation and publication.  We want to win!

Many of you will remember Gwen's fascinating play, THE GRIOTS, presented last year at RTW inaugural Br!NK program. LUCKY NUMBERS is another compelling piece; a touching drama about an
actuary who begins to doubt the power of statistics and mathematical
probability as he and his wife prepare for the birth of their first child. Neither of them could have predicted how the pregnancy will change their lives forever. We believe LUCKY NUMBERS can win, and we need Producers to make it happen.

As a Producer your gift will help us support an important emerging Wisconsin playwright as she takes the national stage.




What We Need 
We need to transport eight people to NYC and back (four actors, director, stage manager, producer and Br!NK Artistic Associate) and
house them in NYC for a week (Yikes! Have you seen the cost of hotels there?).  And we would really love to pay our artists a small stipend. Our fabulous cast includes Milwaukee favorites:


Linnea Koeppel
Julie Swenson
Emily Vitrano

Ken T. Williams


This
is a full two-week commitment for all involved; One week rehearsing in Milwaukee and one week performing in
NYC. 
What your Producing dollars do:  $100 covers all of the props
$500 covers one artists' stipend
$1,000 covers group meals & groceries
$3,000 covers the total airfare costs from MKE - NYC
$7,000 underwrites the housing
$15,000 Be our Executive Producer and underwrite the whole thing! 


   The Impact 
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to showcase our world-class theater and the work of an important emerging playwright on a major national stage.  And who knows what lies in store for us after this. 

As our Producer
for LUCKY NUMBERS your support will:

Launch a Wisconsin playwright Off Off Broadway
Help Renaissance expand opportunities for Midwestern
     female playwrights
Help us grow our Br!NK festival.

</div></div>","Cupcake Campaign
A company of 10 Montreal-based artists--all of whom happen to be women-- have joined forces under the banner of Composite Theatre Co. to bring Marie-Claude Verdier's incisive play Je n'y suis plus to Toronto in a translation entitled I'm Not Here, by award-winning translator and playwright Alexis Diamond. 


I'm Not Here will be presented as part of SummerWorks Performance Festival, August 4-14, 2016. Founded in 1991, SummerWorks Performance Festival is Canada's largest curated performance festival of theatre, dance, music, and live art.  






I'm Not Here: The Story

Winner of Playwrights’
Workshop Montréal’s 2013 Cole Foundation Translation Competition,
I’m Not Here tells the story of our
struggle to stay afloat when weighed down by the endless bombardment of
tragedy, cruelty, superficiality and absurdity in our hyper “interactive”
digital age. 
Between her boss’s cupcake schedule and the distractions of life as an urban singleton,  Ariana tells us the story of her life in a torrent of words, describing a daily existence that’s unravelling, sinking and slipping inevitably towards the brutal and unpredictable unknown. 

I'm Not Here @SummerWorks

Directed
by the visionary Jen Quinn, Composite Theatre Co. offers Marie-Claude Verdier’s timely tale as a conversation between performer and audience. The multifaceted
design team—Sabrina Miller (set and
costumes), Stephanie Moore
(composition and sound design) and Isabel
Quintero Faia (lighting and stage manager)—have created an immersive
experience, with the performance unfolding right around the audience. In the intimacy of Toronto’s hub14, audience members are invited to sit in the play space, in
an attempt to bring the notion of interactivity full circle, back to the lone
storyteller, back to where it all began.

This
unique theatrical happening, co-produced by Stefanie Buxton, will be performed by the compelling Shiong-En Chan, Alex Petrachuk and Nadia
Verrucci, who also doubles as choreographer. 

Cupcakes and iced tea will be served, free of charge, to the 30 audience members. 

Why We're Here
-We believe in the power of performance.
-We believe in offering our audiences an engaging theatre experience. 
-We believe in serving food (or at least libations) at our shows.
-We believe in paying our artists.
-We believe in durable, sustainable theatre. This principle applies to everything from our marketing materials and programs to props and napkins, cups and saucers, and so on...




I'M NOT HERE: The Magnet. Who needs disposable flyers?(Design: Sabrina Miller) 


What We Need
Given the intimacy of the venue and the small number of seats per show, we are asking those of our supporters and patrons who are not able to attend our Benefit Previews in Montreal or our SummerWorks shows in Toronto to consider making a donation to offset the costs of production, transportation and cupcakes. 
We are asking for $7,000 to cover our shortfall. This means the difference between going broke and breaking even!


Why Support This Cupcake Campaign
 -Bring an important play to a new audience. 
-Introduce talented Montreal artists to Toronto.
-Help bridge the gaps between theatre communities in Canada and beyond. 
-Dismantle the silo effect that maintains these gaps between communities by supporting this travelling production. 
-Foster a fresh vision of theatre and live performance. 
We are bringing this show to SummerWorks no matter what. But we'd rather break even doing it.

<div>Over the past 3 years Maiden Phoenix has had a mission to tell women's stories and create more opportunity for women in theatre. We have produced 3 full length productions, all of which have had AT LEAST 51% women represented onstage and off. We have helped forward the conversation on gender parity in theater in Boston and we are excited to continue that work this season.</div>
<div>We chose Sense and Sensibility for its classic roots and universality. It explores different kinds of relationships between women- the sort of relationships that can get short changed on stage and screen. The women of SENSE are complicated, hilarious, imperfect, and fully realized. In other words... people! We always strive to show women on stage who are just as interesting, flawed, and honest as the women we encounter every day in our lives and community. These dynamic characters, combined with this incredible new adaptation and our ridiculously creative artistic team, promises to be truly exciting, new, and leave you breathless (at least the cast will be- this play MOVES).</div>
<div>This year we are taking our work to Roxbury, and partnering with Hibernian Hall in Dudley Square, in order to bring this work to a new and under served community. Performance space is always the trickiest part of producing in the Boston area- we are excited to introduce the Boston theatre-going community to a underutilized and beautiful space in the Boston area (if they haven't had a chance to see it already). The single largest expense this campaign will fund is space. We hope that by producing at Hibernian Hall we will inspire other theatre companies to use this venue as well and thus bring more artistic voices to the Roxbury/ Dudley Square community.</div>
<div>The discussion on Gender Parity over the last few years has come a long way- but we can't let it fade. We need to keep striving year after year, season after season, to make sure that women have equal representation onstage and off. MPTC makes it our mission to do just that and encourage other companies to do the same. Lets take this discussion away from our computer screens and out into our community- that is how change happens- and MPTC is proud to be a part of that change.</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3>
<div>We are asking for $10,000.00 for this production and we want to be very transparent with our contributors about EXACTLY where that money is going.</div>
<div>*We are thrilled to be working with Hibernian Hall in Roxbury, MA for this production:</div>
<div>$2,580.00 will go to Rent for our space</div>
<div>*MPTC is also excited to present the first Boston production of Kate Hamill's new adaptation:</div>
<div>$1,100.00 will go to Rights for the script</div>
<div>* Paying our artists is incredibly important to us. We will never be able to pay our cast, crew, and creative team what they truly deserve, but we make it a priority to pay every one of them and increase our stipends over time;</div>
<div>$4,500.00 will go to stipends for our team</div>
<div>*We are dedicated to giving our Designers the resources they need to create their art:</div>
<div>$1,900 will go to Design budgets</div>

<h3>What does this funding cover?</h3>
<p>It seems simple, but your donation really does go a long way. In addition to our space, your financial support will cover stipends for our entire staff including technical personnel and performance managers to help our artists get the most out of their experience. You will also help us cover the cost of marketing, both to reach artists from every corner of the city and to build a strong, excited audience to come see them!</p>
<p>Space/Insurance ........... $1,200</p>
<p>Personnel ........................ $1,500</p>
<p>Equipment ......................... $800</p>
<p>Marketing ........................ $1,000</p>
<p>Audience Services ............. $500</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What will you get for helping?</h3>
<p>We have put together a wonderful assortment of marathon-themed items for you as a token of our immense gratitude. All donors who give more than $10 will be thanked in our Program/Marathon Guide, but there are many more exciting trophies to be had! Various levels of donations could earn you a water bottle, t-shirt, or hoodie! All apparel and items will feature the Chicago Theatre Marathon logo! Plus:</p>
<p>Donations over $50 receive a pair of one-day passes!</p>
<p>Donations over $150 receive a pair of weekend passes!</p>
<p>Donations over $250 receive TWO pairs of weekend passes!!</p>
<h3>What is the goal of the Marathon?</h3>
<p>We have designed this event wholly with artists in mind.  Your donation allows us to provide a space for artists to try out new work and receive vital audience feedback in the process. There continues to be only limited work and production opportunities for storytellers who do not fit the traditional mold of white, able-bodied, and/or cis-gender male. We hope to address this issue through the power of new work, bringing our community closer together and helping artists be heard.</p>

</div></div>","What does this funding cover?
It seems simple, but your donation really does go a long way. In addition to our space, your financial support will cover stipends for our entire staff including technical personnel and performance managers to help our artists get the most out of their experience. You will also help us cover the cost of marketing, both to reach artists from every corner of the city and to build a strong, excited audience to come see them!
Space/Insurance ........... $1,200
Personnel ........................ $1,500
Equipment ......................... $800
Marketing ........................ $1,000
Audience Services ............. $500

What will you get for helping?
We have put together a wonderful assortment of marathon-themed items for you as a token of our immense gratitude. All donors who give more than $10 will be thanked in our Program/Marathon Guide, but there are many more exciting trophies to be had! Various levels of donations could earn you a water bottle, t-shirt, or hoodie! All apparel and items will feature the Chicago Theatre Marathon logo! Plus:
Donations over $50 receive a pair of one-day passes!
Donations over $150 receive a pair of weekend passes!
Donations over $250 receive TWO pairs of weekend passes!!
What is the goal of the Marathon?
We have designed this event wholly with artists in mind.  Your donation allows us to provide a space for artists to try out new work and receive vital audience feedback in the process. There continues to be only limited work and production opportunities for storytellers who do not fit the traditional mold of white, able-bodied, and/or cis-gender male. We hope to address this issue through the power of new work, bringing our community closer together and helping artists be heard.
You can't afford to donate, but you still want to be involved?

démontrant un intérêt à bénéficier de nos différents services durant l’été.
Malheureusement, plusieurs de ces organisations n’ont simplement pas le budget
nécessaire pour fournir de telles activités à leurs jeunes. C’est pourquoi nous
nous tournons vers notre incroyable réseau de partenaires afin de nous aider à
offrir une programmation d’été au plus grand nombre de jeunes possibles.



With
the money raised, we hope to provide:
WORKSHOPS
Projet RAD will offer 8-12
workshops in youth camps and rehabilitation centres.  These classes promote healthy lifestyle
habits and the development of a creative spirit, in addition to improving
self-esteem and emphasizing strengths.
10 DAY INTENSIVE
AT CAMP MASSAWIPPI
For 10-days Projet RAD will
instruct daily classes to the campers of Camp Massawippi. The session will end
with a choreographed performance in front of all campers, parents, and
friends.  
HIP-HOP DAY 
Projet RAD will host a full
day of inclusive hip-hop activities.  All
events will be free and will include dance lessons, graffiti tutorials, DJ
booths and more!
The aim of Hip-Hop Day is to
educate people about hip-hop culture through fun and accessible activities.

Grâce
à l’argent amassé, nous projetons offrir :

ATELIERS
Projet RAD offrira 8 à 12 ateliers dans divers camps
et centres de réadaptation. Ces ateliers promouvoient de saines habitudes de vie
et le développement d’un esprit créatif, en plus d’améliorer l’estime de soi et
de mettre en valeur les forces de chacun. 

10 JOURS INTENSIFS AU CAMP MASSAWIPPI 
Pendant 10 jours, l’équipe du Projet RAD enseignera
des classes hebdomadaires aux  campeurs du
Camp Massawippi. Cette session intensive se terminera par un spectacle devant
l’ensemble des campeurs, parents et amis. 

JOURNÉE SPÉCIALE (HIP HOP DAY)
Projet RAD organisera une journée complète d’activités
inclusives. L’événement sera gratuit et permettra à tous de danser, apprendre à
créer des graffitis, découvrir l’art d’être un « dj » et plus encore.


L’objectif de cette journée spéciale est de faire
connaitre la culture hip hop à travers des activités amusantes et accessibles.

<p><i>""
I have been an enthusiastic supporter of the 'Boutique Theatre' since
seeing 'The Best little Whore House in Texas' in 2012 when I was
amazed at the quality of community theatre that Ken and Karrie Sebryk
had coordinated and produced in Puerto Vallarta. Witnessing the
growing and expanding excitement with which the theatre was received
was a glowing testament to the professionalism and dedication of the
actors, directors, support staff and producers of everything that was
staged at 'Boutique'.  The longtime commitment that the Sebryk's have
given to live theatre in Vallarta has borne continual successes that
can only be ascribed to hard work, sweat, frustration, fun, giggles,
laughs and camaraderie.  How can anyone not want to be a part of
such a worthwhile endeavour! </i>""

<h3>What's The Story?</h3>
<p>Who could pretend they never lied?</p>
<p>Built around a fictional TV show called ""The Kaspar Hauser Show"", <i>Who Are You?</i> investigates the lives (and lies!) of three imposters who all became infamous at the dawn of the 21st century: a catfish, a chameleon, and a piano man. Their goal? To win the coveted “Anonymity Pass”: the chance to start over again with a new, guilt-free identity. But though all the world’s a stage, no one can remain anonymous forever... Who will you vote for? The power is in your hands!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Do We Need (&amp; Why)?</h3>
<p>We want to raise $10,000 to cover the following fees:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehearsal space;</li>
<li>Production costs (set/props, costumes, marketing, etc.)</li>
<li>Cast &amp; creative team. </li>
</ul>
<p>In return for your generosity, the perks you could get include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A personalized ""Thank You"" email;</li>
<li>A program signed by the cast &amp; creative team;</li>
<li>Two (2) free tickets to a select performance of the show in NYC (travel and accommodations NOT included);</li>
<li>Your name in the program;</li>
<li>A special evening of drinks with the cast &amp; creative team! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What's The Impact?</h3>
<p>Following a London showcase and a stage reading at the Dramatists Guild Fund in NYC, we are thrilled <i>Who Are You?</i> was selected to be presented as part of MITF: Summer 2017 and really want to make the most out of this exciting opportunity. However, producing theatre in New York City can be quite expensive, so we need your help to tell this powerful story. We believe in the potential of our show, and know its subject matter is appealing and extremely relevant to the era we live in. By donating, you will help get a new original musical off the ground, and hopefully make MITF a launching point to whatever the next step is for <i>Who Are You? </i></p>
<p><i>*</i><strong>Please remember: there is no such thing as small donations - every contribution helps!</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help...</h3>
<p>We know $10,000 is A LOT of money. If you can't donate financially - no worries! Here are other ways you can help spread the word about us and make <i>Who Are You?</i> a success at this year's MITF:</p>
<ul>

Two (2) free tickets to a select performance of the show in NYC (travel and accommodations NOT included);
Your name in the program;
A special evening of drinks with the cast & creative team! 


What's The Impact?
Following a London showcase and a stage reading at the Dramatists Guild Fund in NYC, we are thrilled Who Are You? was selected to be presented as part of MITF: Summer 2017 and really want to make the most out of this exciting opportunity. However, producing theatre in New York City can be quite expensive, so we need your help to tell this powerful story. We believe in the potential of our show, and know its subject matter is appealing and extremely relevant to the era we live in. By donating, you will help get a new original musical off the ground, and hopefully make MITF a launching point to whatever the next step is for Who Are You? 
*Please remember: there is no such thing as small donations - every contribution helps!

Other Ways You Can Help...
We know $10,000 is A LOT of money. If you can't donate financially - no worries! Here are other ways you can help spread the word about us and make Who Are You? a success at this year's MITF:

The play is unofficially subtitled ""Where Brokeback Mountain Meets Waiting for Godot.....Sorta"".  I will read the role of Henry and Adam Wylie, who you will recognize from the television series ""Picket Fences"" as well as guest appearances on shows such as ""Judging Amy"", ""Monk"", ""CSI Miami"" and others, will read the part of Curtis.  Adam also appeared in the 2002 Broadway revival of Stephen Sondheim's ""Into the Woods"".  Also graciously lending her support to the staged reading will be Lyn Alicia Henderson who will read stage directions.  Lyn regularly appeared on ""ER"" and has guest appeared on numerous other series including ""Seinfeld"", ""Knight Rider"", ""Boston Legal"", ""Without A Trace"", and others.  The reading is being directed by Joy Hooper who recently directed the very successful production of ""Detroit 67"" at the Los Angeles Theater Center (L.A.T.C.).  Casting for the reading has been by Bruce Newberg, CSA. </div><div> This will be the first, professionally produced, presentation of the play and is, I hope, the first step towards a full production.  The script has been submitted to several theaters in the US and the UK.  Though none have so far opted to produce the play the writing I believe is in good shape.  And while most theaters do not take the time to communicate with playwrights who have submitted manuscripts, in a couple of instances I did receive responses from theaters who regretted that they were unable to offer a production.  For example, the Soho Theatre in London, after reading the play, sent me their writer's report which, among four pages of overwhelmingly positive remarks, described the play as being ""a complex, intelligent and sensitive play, written with a strong sense of what theatre should explore, and how it should go about doing so.""  In addition the Literary Officer for the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh, Scotland wrote me saying that the play was ""...by turns tender and merciless and beautifully written.  Your voice is very much your own and this originality stands out brilliantly.""  These comments and other similarly powerful and supportive comments from other theater professionals are what have kept me going. </div><div> My life long dream has been to work professionally as a writer and actor.  A very long and winding road has brought me to this point, finally.  But in order to offset the $4,500 which this reading has cost, all of which has come out of my own pocket, at the urging of friends and colleagues, I have undertaken this crowdfunding campaign through Indiegogo.  Any support you can provide - and no amount is too large or too small - would be greatly appreciated.  Your generosity and support will never be forgotten.

<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>About National Service.</h3> <p>Conscription or drafting is the compulsory enlistment of people in a national service most often a military service. Conscription dates back to antiquity and continues in some countries to the present day under various names. In most European nations (inspired by the conscription system of the French Revolution in the 1790s) men at a certain age would serve 1-8 years on active duty and then transfer to the reserve force.</p>
<p>Conscription had been legislated in Israeli law since the establishment of the country in 1948, and it applies on all Israeli citizens who have reached the age of 18. The normal length of compulsory service is currently three years for men and two years for women. </p>
<p>During the last year of high school, every boy and girl gets a letter from the army, stating they must report to a specific place and time for a day-long assessment and interview process. After careful examination of the results, the army enlists those who have passed to begin their basic training.</p>
<p>If a soldier is badly wounded, or has been abducted or died during their service, a special team of officers from the army (including social workers and doctors) will arrive at the family home to inform them. The army will then maintain connection with the bereaved family for many years, helping the family perpetuate the memory of their beloved child, and supporting them in their grief and pain.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>How you can help</h3> <p>We believe this project will encourage debate about national service, which can be a divisive subject. It will encourage both sides to listen to each other about the pros and cons of such a system.</p>
<p>We need your help in raising £3000 for our run at the Etcetera Theatre in London. The Money will go towards the following costs:</p>
<p>Artists Fees, Designer Fees, Costume and Props, Theatre rent and Insurance and PR and Marketing.  </p>
<p>We hope that this run at the Etcetera Theatre in London will help us move the production onto the next stage and enable us to produce a longer run in London and/or a touring production.</p>

In most European nations (inspired by the conscription system of the French Revolution in the 1790s) men at a certain age would serve 1-8 years on active duty and then transfer to the reserve force.
Conscription had been legislated in Israeli law since the establishment of the country in 1948, and it applies on all Israeli citizens who have reached the age of 18. The normal length of compulsory service is currently three years for men and two years for women. 
During the last year of high school, every boy and girl gets a letter from the army, stating they must report to a specific place and time for a day-long assessment and interview process. After careful examination of the results, the army enlists those who have passed to begin their basic training.
If a soldier is badly wounded, or has been abducted or died during their service, a special team of officers from the army (including social workers and doctors) will arrive at the family home to inform them. The army will then maintain connection with the bereaved family for many years, helping the family perpetuate the memory of their beloved child, and supporting them in their grief and pain.
    How you can help We believe this project will encourage debate about national service, which can be a divisive subject. It will encourage both sides to listen to each other about the pros and cons of such a system.
We need your help in raising £3000 for our run at the Etcetera Theatre in London. The Money will go towards the following costs:
Artists Fees, Designer Fees, Costume and Props, Theatre rent and Insurance and PR and Marketing.  
We hope that this run at the Etcetera Theatre in London will help us move the production onto the next stage and enable us to produce a longer run in London and/or a touring production.

<div>RAGE Readings began as a summer reading series dedicated to tapping into the diverse creative community in Queens in order to bring unique live programing to Astoria and the surrounding area. 2015 saw us host five evenings featuring an eclectic mix of poetry, fiction, and non-fiction read by either the writer or an actor who was familiar with the material, plus one scripted piece of theatre, all of which took place at the excellent arts supportive venue <a href=""http://www.astoriacoffeeny.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Astoria Coffee</a>.</div>

<div>This year we have decided to get back to our roots -- live theatrical performance. We are doing this by producing the world premier of ""The King is Dead: A one act play on the trials and tribulations of tindering in the modern world in three parts…in three parts."" The King is dead, or TKID for short, is an absurdist piece that draws heavily on inspiration from early existentialist playwrights. Though three story lines taking place in three worlds, it explores the culture of online dating and the idiosyncrasies that seem to go hand in hand with participating in that confusing, often frustrating realm. The cast features four actors, a puppeteer, a musician, and a physical clown.

In place of traditional anonymous casting, we have gathered a cast made of actors who have worked together intimately for a number of years. ""Rehearsal"" is a word that for many brings to mind tedious hours of blocking and frustration. While these will be present in any theatrical environment, we prefer the word ""Play"" to rehearsal and hope to use our time to give value to the thoughts and opinions of all of our collaborators, allowing everyone involved with ""The King is Dead"" to enjoy a feeling of ownership over the performance we are creating.</p>

<p>Telling stories is something that I am passionate about. The first night of our 2015 reading series, I felt a hard rubber ball of anxiety in the pit of my stomach. Would one of my readers cancel last minute? Would anyone come? Would people walk away feeling like they had wasted an evening? At the end of the evening, we had an audience of forty people packed into a space meant for half that number. We received submissions from creatives all over New York City in response, and put on four more evenings like it. At the end of each evening I was inevitably approached by someone, or many someone's, who expressed that a particular story had touched them in a way they hadn't been ready for, or inspired them to continue their creative journey, or made them laugh for the first time in weeks. </p>
<p>Live performance is the root of community. From early human fireside storytelling with cave painting illustrations, to the festival of Dionysus in ancient Greece, to the Globe Theatre in Elizabethan England, to the massive network of artists creating all over the world today, performance is what feeds our souls.

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p><span>     The HOT BLOODed Theatre Co. was founded in 2014 by actor Daniel Csutkai as a result of his need to explore a different kind of theater with the goals of producing work that would immerse audiences in the piece and allow actors to
explore their personal process and craft.</span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">      The HOT BLOODed Theatre Co. is an ensemble-driven
collective of artists who work within a number of guidelines to produce thea</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ter. We eschew the need
for a director, which allows us as actors to explore the vision and aesthetic of
the production throughout the rehearsal process, as opposed to rehearsing and
developing the show with an unchanging vision in mind. Instead, extensive research and experimentation allow us to develop an ensemble vision of the play. Nothing is blocked beforehand – movement,
dance and space are played with, explored, and improvised throughout rehearsal to create a work that flows and is driven by text and
an understanding of character; the work evolves naturally as actors make

</div>","Short Summary
     The HOT BLOODed Theatre Co. was founded in 2014 by actor Daniel Csutkai as a result of his need to explore a different kind of theater with the goals of producing work that would immerse audiences in the piece and allow actors to
explore their personal process and craft.      The HOT BLOODed Theatre Co. is an ensemble-driven
collective of artists who work within a number of guidelines to produce theater. We eschew the need
for a director, which allows us as actors to explore the vision and aesthetic of
the production throughout the rehearsal process, as opposed to rehearsing and
developing the show with an unchanging vision in mind. Instead, extensive research and experimentation allow us to develop an ensemble vision of the play. Nothing is blocked beforehand – movement,
dance and space are played with, explored, and improvised throughout rehearsal to create a work that flows and is driven by text and
an understanding of character; the work evolves naturally as actors make
new choices driven from their evolution within the work.       We work in unconventional
spaces so that both audience and actor may develop a deeper understanding of the work. We
use minimal props, set pieces and costumes, allowing our actors to be fully
present and vital in their own agency. Our audience
is a part of the process – this means that they may be seated,
standing, moving in the space, adding the
fundamental energy that makes our work necessary. Our theater is immersive,
adaptive, dynamic and experimental.

      In 2015, we developed our first work, THE SEAGULL by Anton Chekhov, with the Rocks Pop
Up Project in Sydney, Australia. This

<b>Brian Friel</b>:                       <p></p>
<p><span>I was
very heavily influenced by the late Brian Friel and, whilst I am not

it's
the Internet Movie Data Base. <br/>
There
you will find credits, photos, ratings, a couple of biographies and
even a few comments – mainly about me playing <i>Doctor Who</i> which
didn't amount to much at all.<br/>
Apart
from the movies and TV, I have worked in the theatre in repertory at:</p>
<p>The Belgrade Theatre, Coventry, Royal Theatre, Northampton; The Everyman Theatre, Cheltenham;
Birmingham Repertory Theatre, Birmingham; National Tour of the UK in <i>Fur Coat and No Knickers </i>(a comedy, would you believe) <i>A Treat</i> at The Soho Poly Theatre, London (to terrific national reviews) and an award
winning play, <i>Lovely</i>, at Santa Monica Playhouse, California which ran
for nine months. </p>
<p>I've also played a one man Irish show called <i>A
Bit Of Irish, </i>intermittently, from the year 2001 to 2010.</p>

</div>
<p>
The
amount of funding needed on this project is a further £6000.</p>
<p>
I
say further because I have raised £4000 already – so someone has
faith in me! Because I've managed to raise that, the theatre rental is taken care of.</p>
<p>
<u><b>Advertising</b></u>:</p>
<p>
Most
of the £6000 will be needed for advertising as there is very little
point in doing the play at all if we are playing to empty houses. 
</p>
<p>
I
plan to take a quarter of a page in <i>Timeout </i>and maybe an
eighth of a page the following week if funds allow. 
</p><p>The local newspaper, The<i> London Evening Standard</i>, will be used for listing the times and dates of the play.<br/></p><p>I was asked how much this would cost and it would be about  £2,834 for <i>Timeout</i> and the Standard about £900.</p><p>Then there is the printing of the programmes £100, the A5 flyers, £150 and the posters will be about £75.</p>
<p>An extra large poster and maybe post cards.</p>
<p>
<u><b>Rehearsals.</b></u></p>
<p>
We
will be rehearsing the play full time for one week before the opening
night and part time for the preceding three weeks. This will involve
three week's salary to the person playing my daughter and one week's
salary to a stage manager for the final week of rehearsal.</p>
<p>I have managed to find a place to rehearse for the final week and I am talking to people about the other rehearsal days and a meeting place for prospective Kates; Kates? I hear you say - yes the name of the other character is <b>Kate</b>.</p><p>Kate's minimum pay will be £900 - that is for one week in the play, one week's rehearsal plus 6 days @ £50. This I will be able to manage it with this budget. </p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">I
will not be taking a salary at all but will wait to see how the play
fares at the box office before taking any funds. I'm not expecting to make a profit but if we do or I have money surplus to our requirements it will be paid to the Equity members who will be on minimum pay; including me.</span></p>
<p>
The
production will be monitored by Equity (The British version) and the
<i>Equity Fringe Agreement for Performers and Stage Management </i>will
be adhered to.</p>
<p>
I
am a member of Equity as well as being the producer.</p>
<p>
<b>The
Final Financial Figure</b>.</p>
<p>
If
I do not reach the figure required, compromises will have to be made
with advertising; for example less advertising in<i> Time Out</i>, two lines
instead of three in <i>The Standard</i> but there will be no compromise with
regards to any salaries.</p><p><b>Currencies</b>:</p><p>Incidentally this campaign, because I am in the UK, is in British pounds; sterling in other words, i.e. <b>£</b>. </p><p>There is no key on the American key board for <b>£</b> but you can get it by typing the following - hold down <b>alt</b> type <b>0163 </b>then release.</p><p>Today if you contribute £1 and your currency is in American dollars, for example, your contribution will cost you $1.39.</p><p>A rough ball park conversion rate is as follows - but <b>only</b> for today and only for American dollars.</p><p><b>£</b>50 = <b>$</b>69.20.  <b>£</b>100 = <b>$</b>138.50.  <b>£</b>150 = <b>$</b>207.87.  <b>£</b>200 = <b>$</b>277.16.</p><p>These rates change by the minute so check the converter against your own currency.

the time of preparing this campaign I have yet to cast someone to

to make <b>The 2 Sides of Eddie Ramone </b>a first class professional production -  because we are
professionals.</span></p>
<p><b>Experience as a producer</b>:</p>
<p>
I
have run my own shows since 2002 which involved booking theatres on
the other side of the world – I lived in Los Angeles when I booked
theatres in the UK: the Edinburgh Festival, a UK tour to Edinburgh
(before I did the festival), Bridgnorth and (as it happens) the
Jermyn Street Theatre in London.</p>
<p>I also took the Irish show to colleges in Los Angeles and the Irish Fare at Santa Anita Race Track in California.</p>
<p>
Arranging
a tour and booking theatres means, when you get to each theatre,
lighting needs to be arranged, sound cues, lighting cues and the
general upkeep of the show; so I know what to expect, but it's fun, I love it and I look forward to doing it again with this play.</p>
<p>The easy thing about this venue is that the theatre supply someone to 'run the show' so once it's all plotted I will just have to concentrate on attracting an audience.</p>
<p>I have also produced and directed a couple of films, two music videos, some sketches (one of them on the <i>Laugh or Die</i> web site) and written 2 novels which are for sale as paperback, kindle and talking books on Amazon. </p>

fares at the box office before taking any funds. I'm not expecting to make a profit but if we do or I have money surplus to our requirements it will be paid to the Equity members who will be on minimum pay; including me.

The
production will be monitored by Equity (The British version) and the
Equity Fringe Agreement for Performers and Stage Management will
be adhered to.

I
am a member of Equity as well as being the producer.

The
Final Financial Figure.

If
I do not reach the figure required, compromises will have to be made
with advertising; for example less advertising in Time Out, two lines
instead of three in The Standard but there will be no compromise with
regards to any salaries.Currencies:Incidentally this campaign, because I am in the UK, is in British pounds; sterling in other words, i.e. £. There is no key on the American key board for £ but you can get it by typing the following - hold down alt type 0163 then release.Today if you contribute £1 and your currency is in American dollars, for example, your contribution will cost you $1.39.A rough ball park conversion rate is as follows - but only for today and only for American dollars.£50 = $69.20.  £100 = $138.50.  £150 = $207.87.  £200 = $277.16.These rates change by the minute so check the converter against your own currency. Here is one to be going on with or you may have an 'app' on your phone:Before you click on to this I have to tell you that it will take you away from this page.http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/Perks:There are perks available but you can send any amount of money if you wish to participate from £1 to whatever you like. If you want to claim a perk do so when you contribute. I haven't done this before so I am presuming that's the procedure - if not I'll say so in the updates which, I believe, come to you automatically. - here are examples of the perks:'The Saint' crew jacket and the Dodgers Baseball Jersey.
STIG 'TOP GEAR' TEE SHIRT. - FRONT AND BACK.Casting:
At
the time of preparing this campaign I have yet to cast someone to
play my daughter, Kate. The main reason is that it's too early. The play is
due to open in July – and then only for a week – and it would be
unfair to ask anybody to keep themselves available for such a
distance in the future.  

However
I will come to that and I'll be looking for someone who is talented, brilliant and experienced.
Risks and Challenges:

There
will be risks and challenges on the way, I am sure, and one of my jobs will be to anticipate what they might be.
Number one is getting this to you, not to bother you too much and making sure targets are met; I will be in touch again if the campaign drops off and if it does drop off permanently I will research new avenues of finance. 
Before rehearsals even start I have to cast Kate, put final touches to A5 fliers, posters - first of all six for the theatre and then a batch more to circulate

Targets have to be met artistically so we have to allow plenty of time and concentrated effort for rehearsals. It's no good telling the audience you had a cold in rehearsals when your performance is no good - they don't want to know so we will have to work very hard
to make The 2 Sides of Eddie Ramone a first class professional production -  because we are
professionals.
Experience as a producer:

I
have run my own shows since 2002 which involved booking theatres on
the other side of the world – I lived in Los Angeles when I booked
theatres in the UK: the Edinburgh Festival, a UK tour to Edinburgh
(before I did the festival), Bridgnorth and (as it happens) the
Jermyn Street Theatre in London.
I also took the Irish show to colleges in Los Angeles and the Irish Fare at Santa Anita Race Track in California.

Arranging
a tour and booking theatres means, when you get to each theatre,
lighting needs to be arranged, sound cues, lighting cues and the
general upkeep of the show; so I know what to expect, but it's fun, I love it and I look forward to doing it again with this play.
The easy thing about this venue is that the theatre supply someone to 'run the show' so once it's all plotted I will just have to concentrate on attracting an audience.
I have also produced and directed a couple of films, two music videos, some sketches (one of them on the Laugh or Die web site) and written 2 novels which are for sale as paperback, kindle and talking books on Amazon. 
Other Ways you can help.

I
realise that some people just can't contribute – but you may be
able to spread the word; sometimes that's even better – you may be
passing it on to our biggest contributor yet; who knows?


Maybe enter my information on the timeline of your facebook page, or tell all your friends and people in your email
address book.

As
I mentioned The 2 Sides of Eddie Ramone means a lot to me – I hope
you can help in whatever way you can - become part of the family of this exciting new venture and turn it into an adventure that YOU can be proud of too.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

Is everyone who lives in the mountains like the characters in Deliverance? Do people from the flatlands not understand a thing? I Ain't Made That Way tackles these questions and examines the true meaning of family.  The audience is part of the cast and we are partnering with local restaurants to sell the show as a dinner theatre. 
The show is being produced without the financial help of an existing theatre company, which is why we need your help to make it happen. Here's what you can help with:

Production staff stipends
Production materials
Artist stipends
Marketing materials
Script printing
Music fees

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a playwright whose work has been performed in many New York City venues. My musical, <i>In the Schoolyard</i>, for which I wrote the book and lyrics, was part of the 2010 New York Fringe Festival. <i>When I Get to Heaven</i> is especially important for me because this time, I have also written the music. What's more the musical is about a deeply spiritual subject - the nature of salvation. It's also pretty funny.</p>

</p><p>Okay, our video has persuaded you to scroll down. So who are we?</p>
<p>Let us introduce ourselves. We are Sofa Productions, an independent theatre company consisting of over 20 actors &amp; directors who have a passion for producing well crafted theatre. Our aim has always been to provide opportunities for talented young creatives to showcase their work and gain invaluable experience in the world of theatre. Our technique revolves around detailed design of characters, costumes &amp; sets and a love for creating unique theatre experiences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And did someone say three shows in one night?</p>
<p>Why yes! This year our aim is to bring three amazing shows to the Camden Fringe Festival, which will all be performed every night from 24th-28th August. And we have something to cater for all tastes: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Like Comedy? At 6pm we start with 'From Russia with Laugh', a collection of three side splitting short stories from one of Mother Russia's greatest writers, Anton Chekhov. This one hour show brings to life a set of rambunctious characters set to some fantastic Russian music &amp; dancing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How about something tense and gripping? Extremities at 7:30pm is a thriller of a play by William Mastrosimone. It tells the tale of what happens when a man with unspeakably sinnisiter intentions breaks into three females apartment, before the tables are eventually turned on him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or what about something really, really scary? Fright Nights at 9:30pm promises to be the scariest show in Camden Fringe this year. Four gruesome tales of horror, blood and gore will send shivers down your spine like never before!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The venue, Theatro Technis, is a classic theatre space in Camden, with a bar to keep you fully 'hydrated' inbetween shows. Our ticket prices are a bargain at £5 a show. That's £15 for three shows in central London. Now you ask, why so cheap? Well, we believe that great theatre should be accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what do you need and what do i get?</p>
<p>Well in total we need  to raise £3000. This is to cover theatre hire, props and costumes. All of our actors, directors and producers work for free and really are doing it simply for the love of their craft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In return for your supreme kindness and generosity, you will not only receive one of the perks listed but also a huge slice of good karma, our eternal gratitude and the knowledge that you have made us able to realise our dream with this project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other ways you can help:</p>
<p>Please feel free to share information about us and our show on social media. Even better, come along to watch the performances and bring your friends! Make a night of it during the last week of August or give yourself a treat during the bank holiday weekend.</p>

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>You can help great actors make a great show! Julie Gaarskjær and Kamilla Reinholdt are a couple of talented actors who built this play and toured it in Denmark before coming to New York to further their craft completing conservatory at Stella Adler Studio. They've joined forces with three more great actors, Ashley Kryzinsky, Christian Lopez-Lamelas, and Lorenzo Luchetti to devise a few more scenes and ratchet up the play for US audiences. Led by director Tania Kass and produced by Kenneth Shook the actors are ready to premier the piece in New York!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to cover several expenses including talent. That's where we really need your help to raise $4,000. When you support this team of talent you'll not only feel good about helping a creative lot, you're supporting important stories about women! As a result, we want to recognize you for helping us. From hand written thank yous to songs written for you and tickets to the show.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Fourth Rib from the Right is an entertaining exposé into the daily lives of three women. The play focuses on the themes of identity and taboos as they relate to one’s body. Rounding out the ensemble are two male characters who reveal contrasts and some similarities between men and women. Once on tour in Denmark, the current production has been re-devised and is now ready to entertain audiences in the US. This play can relate to both men and women and is hugely important today especially in NYC where women are often harassed.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>We want you to know where funds are going. It's a very small budget our largest expense is the space. Ticket sales will cover a portion of the costs. Here's what you will help to cover:</p>
<p><strong>Expenses</strong><br/>Talent: $3,500<br/>Space: $2,500<br/>Production (Props, Insurance, etc.): $1,700</p>

<h3>About Company C  </h3>
<p>Company C is a theatre troupe founded by its Director, Lawrence O´Connor, comprising actors, creatives and technicians. The company follows the precedents of the New York Group theatre and Moscow Arts theatre, as a family of practitioners working together on successive productions with geographical ´homes´ from which it finds, engages with, and strengthens its local communities and to which it is of service.  Company C´s key principle is to show up and tell the truth in all that it does.</p>
<p>There is more information about us at <a href=""http://Companyc.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://Companyc.co.uk</a></p>
<h3><strong>About our Tempest Production</strong></h3>
<p>Lawrence chose The Tempest as Company C's first production as he believes it captures and articulates its universal human truths in a form that crosses cultural boundaries and barriers. The play sheds light on and raises questions of relationship e.g. between parent-child, lover-loved, carer-caree and oppressor-oppressed roles, loss, personal transformation, fear, resolution, what it is to be free/not free and what it is for a person to find themselves - not of their choosing - in a strange land and what this means to identity and the difference between ´ĺiving´ and ´surviving´.  All extremely relevant and topical themes for life today.</p>

<p>Gwyn Emberton Dance is a new dance/theatre company, set up in October 2015 by award-winning choreographer Gwyn Emberton and Producer Kate Perridge.  The first first show by the company is Shadow Of A Quiet Society which toured Wales in early 2016.</p>
<p>After a few funding set backs and dancers who have been injured or ill during the making of SQS, we need support to get back into the studio to rework the piece before the final stages of the tour.  We have a few more performances in Wales and one in Bristol, which we are using as a launch event to introduce the company to theatres and arts centres in England:<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3></h3>
<p><b>Bristol
- Circomedia - 14th October</b></p>
<p><b>Caernarfon
- Galeri - 10th November</b></p>
<p><b>Cardiff
- Dance House (Wales Millennium Centre) - 12th November</b></p>
<div><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></h3></div>
<p>We have had generous support so far from both Arts Council England and Arts Council Wales, but due to other grants being withdrawn we need all the help we can get. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need to raise £3,000.  This will pay for two dancers for the rehearsal period and performances in Bristol, Cardiff and Caernarfon.  This will match the grant that we have received from Arts Council Wales for the performances and will support the England Company Launch in Bristol.</p>
<p>We are offering perks to suit all budgets - from a unique behind-the-scenes invite to a dress rehearsal to the chance to become a patron of the company and have tickets to all our opening nights (forever!)</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Funding for the arts is hard.  That's the honest truth. We have always been able to make miracles happen on very little money.  But sometimes we need a bit of help and support to make those miracles happen.</p>
<p>We have put a lot of our own funds into the company so far, plus a lot of elbow grease, sweat and a few tears.  We've had ups and downs, but the 'ups' are definitely the way our audiences react to the work that we make.  We want to be able to make more work, to reach more people and offer a new voice to the arts.</p>
<p>So far we have ...</p>

<li>Got some great reviews and received critical acclaim for Shadow Of A Quiet Society on tour in 2016</li>
<li>Won awards! Gwyn won Best Choreographer at the Wales Theatre Awards 2015</li>
<li>Were invited to perform at British Dance Edition 2016 [international showcase of the best contemporary dance from the UK]</li>

After a few funding set backs and dancers who have been injured or ill during the making of SQS, we need support to get back into the studio to rework the piece before the final stages of the tour.  We have a few more performances in Wales and one in Bristol, which we are using as a launch event to introduce the company to theatres and arts centres in England:


Bristol
- Circomedia - 14th October
Caernarfon
- Galeri - 10th November
Cardiff
- Dance House (Wales Millennium Centre) - 12th November

We have had generous support so far from both Arts Council England and Arts Council Wales, but due to other grants being withdrawn we need all the help we can get.    What We Need & What You Get We need to raise £3,000.  This will pay for two dancers for the rehearsal period and performances in Bristol, Cardiff and Caernarfon.  This will match the grant that we have received from Arts Council Wales for the performances and will support the England Company Launch in Bristol.
We are offering perks to suit all budgets - from a unique behind-the-scenes invite to a dress rehearsal to the chance to become a patron of the company and have tickets to all our opening nights (forever!)
    The Impact Funding for the arts is hard.  That's the honest truth. We have always been able to make miracles happen on very little money.  But sometimes we need a bit of help and support to make those miracles happen.
We have put a lot of our own funds into the company so far, plus a lot of elbow grease, sweat and a few tears.  We've had ups and downs, but the 'ups' are definitely the way our audiences react to the work that we make.  We want to be able to make more work, to reach more people and offer a new voice to the arts.
So far we have ...


Produced My People at Edinburgh Festival Fringe as part of Wales in Edinburgh Showcase in 2015

Got some great reviews and received critical acclaim for Shadow Of A Quiet Society on tour in 2016
Won awards! Gwyn won Best Choreographer at the Wales Theatre Awards 2015
Were invited to perform at British Dance Edition 2016 [international showcase of the best contemporary dance from the UK]

Help us continue this great work through 2016 and into 2017!

<p>Ghost Light Players of MetroWest is a non-profit theater group operating out of Marlborough, Massachusetts and serving the MetroWest MA area.  Now in our fifth season, Ghost Light Players hearkens back to the days of old, when traveling troupes entertained their patrons with little more than a few props, masterful skill and an avid love of theater. Our sets are small, our costumes are minimal, but our talents and passions are great.  Our Board of Governors includes members with a more than 20 years of experience producing and directing theater, and we feel incredibly lucky to feature some of the most talented actors in New England. </p>
<h3><strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Creating art is not an easy task, and this project brings many challenges.  Not only are we producing a unique Shakespeare experience, but we are also taking that work across the ocean to an international festival.  It is a huge undertaking, but we have the infrastructure and experience as producers and artists to succeed.  Our cast and crew is a talented group of dedicated volunteers who are passionate about bringing locally created theater to the international stage.  Our educational coordinators are developing an experiential learning curriculum so that we can share our work with students in local schools. </p>

While I was walking around looking at the pieces I found myself creating dance movement within them, on them, around them, and in front of them.

Then I had the idea to create a dance film, that would capture all the art pieces and interesting movement possibilities and phrases. It was still art that inspired dance art, which lead to my vision for PEAKS. My vision has now evolved from an exploration to a personal objective to show people the local art work that is being produced in Calgary, as well as outside work that artist's have brought into the community. I also want to showcase local contemporary dancers who are committed to enriching the dance community and expanding it.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>It’s 2015 and the United States is rife with violent arrests of young black men. Peaceful protests against the violent arrest and death of Freddy Gray, an unarmed black man turn into an all out riot overnight. The Baltimore Riots of 2015 were a breaking point for police brutality in the U.S. Man Down by Hannah Trujillo is an original play that examines racial violence through the lens of a romantic relationship.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Eva Ramirez and Michael Sterling’s unyielding love holds them together as a surge in police brutality against young black men ripples through the United States. Eva’s devotion to Michael is challenged when her estranged brother Eddie reappears asking to reconnect. Seemingly thuggish Freddie also reveals himself and complicates things for Michael.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Every dollar donated goes to our scenic, costume, and shipping needs. </p>
<p>We need $1,600 for our scenic design. Which includes our set and props, as well as shipping costs. Because we're traveling from Los Angeles, some of our set needs to travel with us. These shipping costs if unfunded, can deter us from having the set we need to perform with.</p>
<p>We need $400 for our custom costume designs. Each character has two-three custom designed costumes. </p>
<p>We need $200 to fully produce the original music for the show and share that on a streaming service.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you contribute, we can send you personalized videos thanking you for your contribution, a copy of our original compositions, a producer credit, or you can also be invited to preview the show in LA before we travel to Edinburgh. </p>
<p>BUT MOST OF ALL, </p>
<p>YOU GET THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING YOU SUPPORTED YOUNG ARTISTS ! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we reach this financial goal, we can produce the show the way it is intended to be seen. </p>
<p>Your donation also helps students, and graduates learn how to produce a theatrical performance or event. You also are creating a sense of community through your patronage, and supporting the work of young artists.</p>
<p><strong>Your contribution helps give this team a life-changing experience making relevant and creative stories come to life in one of the biggest international theatre festivals.</strong></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
It’s 2015 and the United States is rife with violent arrests of young black men. Peaceful protests against the violent arrest and death of Freddy Gray, an unarmed black man turn into an all out riot overnight. The Baltimore Riots of 2015 were a breaking point for police brutality in the U.S. Man Down by Hannah Trujillo is an original play that examines racial violence through the lens of a romantic relationship.
 
Eva Ramirez and Michael Sterling’s unyielding love holds them together as a surge in police brutality against young black men ripples through the United States. Eva’s devotion to Michael is challenged when her estranged brother Eddie reappears asking to reconnect. Seemingly thuggish Freddie also reveals himself and complicates things for Michael.
 

What We Need & What You Get
Every dollar donated goes to our scenic, costume, and shipping needs. 
We need $1,600 for our scenic design. Which includes our set and props, as well as shipping costs. Because we're traveling from Los Angeles, some of our set needs to travel with us. These shipping costs if unfunded, can deter us from having the set we need to perform with.
We need $400 for our custom costume designs. Each character has two-three custom designed costumes. 
We need $200 to fully produce the original music for the show and share that on a streaming service.
 
If you contribute, we can send you personalized videos thanking you for your contribution, a copy of our original compositions, a producer credit, or you can also be invited to preview the show in LA before we travel to Edinburgh. 
BUT MOST OF ALL, 
YOU GET THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING YOU SUPPORTED YOUNG ARTISTS ! 
 

The Impact
If we reach this financial goal, we can produce the show the way it is intended to be seen. 
Your donation also helps students, and graduates learn how to produce a theatrical performance or event. You also are creating a sense of community through your patronage, and supporting the work of young artists.
Your contribution helps give this team a life-changing experience making relevant and creative stories come to life in one of the biggest international theatre festivals.

<p><strong>Our Analysis</strong><br/>The dance community as a whole is a very bright place.

<p>Over the past few years, while dance has gotten much bigger, it's also become more intimidating for anyone who might have even the slightest interest to try and take a class.</p>
<p>On the other hand, even if they do take a class, they are usually met with extremely overwhelming combinations and sometimes may not get any sort of feedback from the instructor. It is usually then that some people decide that dance just isn't for them.</p>

<p>I am embarking on a campaign to produce a live theatrical multimedia play which incorporates film, and theater.  This production will take an introspective look into the mind of a writer who appears to have it all together, but the pressure to be successful,  a tumultuous home life and unresolved issues blur the line between art and torment.</p>
<p>My name is James Gillard   I am an accomplished filmmaker, playwright, and author.   My films, plays and books have been showcased throughout venues in the United States.   These stories focus on telling the stories of the African Diaspora that are true to the integrity of the global Black experience (struggles, identity, moral conflicts and social conditions).</p>
<p><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></p>
<p>Darcy Sinclair is the new hot shot writer on the scene his essays and short stories on black life have garnered him fame.  He now embarks on his first book.  Funny thing is he's come down with a severe case of writers block.  It is here he meets a mysterious woman who encourages, seduces and torments him.  Darcy witnesses firsthand the whirlwind effects of substance abuse.  Unbeknownst to Darcy Sinclair he is about to write his greatest work -- his life.</p>
<p><strong>WHY?</strong></p>
<p>Growing up in the village of Harlem I witnessed the  damaging effects that alcohol/heroine and the crack could have on families.   Some of my immediate family members struggled with addictions -- which often made me wonder why would someone subject themselves to this inner torment.   In talking to a number of people battling addiction about 60% felt their abuse was a coping mechanism which provided a means of escape.  Which meant that their true issue was never addressed (identity, well-being or status) </p>
<p>It was my goal to give a face to this issue.  Not just by showing stereotypical images but addressing those trigger points that can cause addiction.   In creating this story I soon found out that we all have the gene for addictive behavior and it can be displayed in some form or fashion.  </p>
<p><strong>PRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>I would like to showcase this  play on four Sundays during the month of September (2nd, 9th, 16th and 23rd.).  matinee performance at 3:30 pm showtimes and dinner served.  We would like to create an atmosphere that allows patrons to really experience firsthand the provocative subject matter.  The production will incorporate  film and live actors.  </p>
<p>Your contribution would help to pay for actors fees, set design, wardrobe, and to secure all 4 dates in September.   Live theater events in Harlem are few and far between.   Due to huge rental fees it is extremely challenging for independent producers to secure theaters and if so they might only be able to have a 2 to 3 show run.  Which means a good production may never have a chance to have a following. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I'm hoping hat the contribution you make will afford this production to  have staying power and serve as a catalyst for innovative producers to present theater in non theatrical environments.</p>

<p><strong>           The estimated costs for the project are as follows:</strong></p>
<p><strong>People’s Services: $17,300 </strong></p>

<h3><strong><strong>What if we don't reach our goal?  </strong></strong></h3>
<p>If the entire goal of $15,000 is not met, any funds raised will go to the project and a reduced budget will be implemented.  Several reduced budget scenarios have been planned out in the case of fundraising goals not being met.  It is the sincere hope of all collaborators that the goal will be met and that the success of this fundraising campaign will garner more enthusiastic support in other fundraising efforts for the project.  A grant in the amount of $4,200 has been secured from the Virginia Commission for the Arts as of the launch of this campaign. </p>
<h3><strong>About the Collaborators</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Highlands Ballet Company</strong></p>
<p>The Highlands Ballet Company (HBC) is a 501(C)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to the fine art of classical ballet and dance. The mission of HBC is to provide entertainment, educational and cultural opportunities in dance for Southwest Virginia and Northeast Tennessee and to promote the understanding, appreciation and enjoyment of dance. HBC offers young dancers training in theater arts and gives them opportunities to perform in live theater. HBC thrives on new choreography for classical and contemporary works.</p>
<p>The Highlands Ballet Company and its primary feeder school, the Highlands Center for Ballet Arts, work together to help educate, provide support, and to prepare aspiring young dancers for whatever future they may desire! The school provides the foundation during the childhood years; while the Highlands Ballet Company offers advanced students the opportunity for further study and to share the special training and performing opportunities of a civic dance company.</p>
<p><strong>Evelyn Pursley-Kopitzke, Composer</strong></p>
<p>Evelyn Pursley-Kopitzke (MM in composition, University of TN, and over four decades of experience) is a Tanzania-born, active freelance composer and master musical story-teller who lives in northeast Tennessee. Her extensive and varied oeuvre has been heard from coast to coast in the US, and in Europe. She has repeatedly been commissioned to write for The Paramount Chamber Players.</p>
<p>From the composer, Evelyn Pursley-Kopitzke:  ""The music I write always tells stories. The most wonderful thing about this project is that I get to tell my favorite tales from my childhood in Africa – some true, others make-believe. Every new musical work I write comes with homework: I study forms, instruments, and performers. This time, I researched ballet, and had a marvelous time attending Highlands Ballet Company’s productions. I’ve watched stories — told in dance — that are old, but somehow have become brand new. I’ve sat, mouth open, watching a cat-person that you’d swear was a real cat."" </p>
<p><strong>The Paramount Chamber Players</strong></p>
<p>The Paramount Chamber Players (TPCP), a 501(c)(3) organization, celebrates its 14th season in 2018 - 2019. TPCP is the premiere chamber ensemble in southwestern Virginia and northeast Tennessee, and presents twelve concerts each season (three each in Bristol, Kingsport, and Johnson City, TN and Abingdon, VA.)</p>
<p>TPCP has commissioned and premiered 11 new works from local composers. Dr. Combs began commissioning new works with the call for composition in which Evelyn Pursley-Kopitzke was a winner. The ensemble brought her unusual and delightful African Vignettes to the concert stage. When Dr. Combs and others suggested that that a ballet was the logical next step, Pursley-Kopitzke identified Deirdre Cole and the HBC as the visionary ballet company in the region capable of this project.</p>
<p>TPCP will provide the live music accompaniment for <i>Magic Butterfly</i> at no cost to HBC as part of TPCP’s concert season.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Magic Butterfly, the ballet, will have a multi-faceted positive impact on its southwestern Virginia, northeastern Tennessee, and online audiences, its ballet dancers, and the musicians. It will even affect non-audience members through the extensive media campaign that is planned.</p>
<p><strong>Community Benefit</strong>: Magic Butterfly brings to the region a cultural collage that is innovative and unprecedented. It will include new classical music with newly choreographed dancing, performed to live music, in collaboration with the composer. It tells a story set in an exotic locale from a child’s point of view, while retaining the engagement of adult audience members. The story, which includes love and loss, danger and rescue, beauty and sorrow, demonstrates the African experience and yet retains the universal human condition.</p>
<p><strong>Students and Teachers</strong>: Students and teachers from surrounding schools will be invited to the morning performance at a very low cost. For many, this may be their ONLY experience with a classical chamber ensemble or ballet. We are thrilled to present to them this unparalleled performance – especially if it’s their only exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Dancers</strong>: The Highlands Ballet Company dancers will be inspired by the Paramount Chamber Players’ rich, soul-feeding musical interpretations in real time. Since the classical music they have previously danced to has solely been recorded, the “magic” that only live music provides will be new territory for the dancers. They will FEEL the difference and that difference will translate into an artistic experience of the highest order. That feeling will also produce new levels of “magic” in their portrayals onstage, which will in turn be transmitted to the audience.</p>
<p><strong>Musicians</strong>: The Paramount Chamber Players (TPCP) are also exploring new territory. They, as an ensemble, have never before played for a ballet, or played from the orchestra pit. They will also be performing in a new-to-them venue, the McGlothlin Center, VA. In addition, performing for school children is new to TPCP. Performances for school children have not been part of their usual season. Even for an ensemble that regularly commissions and premieres new music, this collaborative production is new and exciting. They will be performing seven all-new movements and the preexisting 30 minutes will be rewritten longer.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond SWVA &amp; NETN</strong>:  We are excited to present the world premiere of Magic Butterfly to the region and plan to tour the production, especially to under-served VA regions, in the future.  After HBC and The Paramount Chamber Players (TPCP) have premiered Magic Butterfly, almost all the elements will be in place for future performances, with or without live music.</p>
<p>Magic Butterfly will also be available for licensing by other ballet companies. Since the music only requires six musicians it would be more financially affordable for them to have live music--without hiring an entire orchestra (100+ musicians). The recordings will also be available for production licensing.</p>
<p>Magic Butterfly adds a distinctly viable option to ballet repertoire as a whole, and does so in a way that is innovative and culturally significant.</p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>As with any ""new"" project, especially within the genre of the performing arts, there are inherent risks in the production of such a work.  Due to the nature of this production - live music with original ballet choreography - this region has rarely been exposed to the performing arts in this form.  The uniqueness of the project offers great benefits to the region, as well as presenting risks for all involved in the project.  All collaborators on the project recognize the risks and negotiated budget constraints, venue prices and ticketing fees to lower costs and risks associated with the project.</p>
<p>Because the Southwest Virginia population is low density, made up of small communities widely scattered across the mountains and valleys of ""coal country,"" performances of this scale, especially with live music, are rare.  People who frequent Barter Theatre or Music Department performances at Emory &amp; Henry College will be expected to attend, as well as people who have never been to a major stage performance of chamber music or ballet. </p>
<p>Audience at the Paramount Center performance will expand the faithful Paramount Chamber Players' audience, including many from Bristol, VA, and Abingdon, VA. Because Highlands Ballet Company will be guest performers with The Paramount Chamber Players, Highlands Ballet Company will not control ticket prices. The Paramount Chamber Players' ticket prices are usually $15 for adults, and often, free for students. The Paramount Chamber Players is able to keep prices low to attract a wider demographic through the generosity of their many patrons.  The overall low-cost and value in the ticket prices reduces the risk of venues being left ""half-sold.""</p>

<p>Our work brings people together – it creates connections, makes people laugh and enjoy a dynamic and colourful spectacle. Don’t take our word for it – here’s some comments from people that have worked with us and seen our work themselves:</p>
<p><i> “It was wonderful to see so many young people from across the North West performing at the beginning of U Dance 2016.  The blend of traditional folk dance and contemporary hip hop clearly enabled all the young people to express their individuality.  <strong>The piece seemed to bring folk dance to life for a new generation and the energy and obvious enthusiasm of the performers was infectious! </strong> It was great to see traditional folk dance embraced as a vibrant part of young people’s dance in the UK.” </i></p>

<p><i>Street Dance the Maypole was a <strong>brilliant visual focal point</strong>, filling the space with colours and energy. The teachers were quick to adapt the level of the workshop to the ability of the participants ... everyone really enjoyed themselves!</i></p>

<p><i> ‘I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed the show last night – a <strong>great mix of dance styles</strong> blended into a <strong>cohesive performance</strong> full of energy, skill and a real sense of joy!  Lovely costumes and colourful props created a terrific environment in which to perform.  All the elements worked well (I loved the “mumming” reference!) and I can see the potential (as you surely can) for this to grow into a bigger show with educational aspects and huge workshop potential.’  </i></p>

<p>We are always ducking and diving – being efficient and nifty with all our expenditure, reusing and revising our resources, our costumes, our admin and management, our sets and equipment… and ideas! We believe this is fundamental to our creativity and keeps us on our toes – but we also need additional support to have valuable time to think, plan, devise and develop into the future. This is where we need your support!  If we get the planning and devising right then we’re confident we can produce some stunning new ideas and performances – we’ve got so many great ideas, and just need some support to make those a reality.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We know that money is tight. If you can’t contribute the hard cash you can still really help and support us by putting the word out to local event and festival promoters, schools, dance groups and dance agencies and tell them about our work. And you can pass on the news about this campaign and encourage people to join us!  <strong>THANK YOU!</strong></p>

What We Need & What You Get
We need £2000 from our crowdfunding appeal to help keep us devise new shows and participatory workshops for children, young people, families and adults.

It will contribute to studio time for the artistic directors to experiment and devise; rehearsal costs for the company; costume development; technical experimentation and equipment (those maypole ribbons need to be shiny and perfect each time you see them!).

The lawsuit alleged Chevron destroyed the rainforest in Ecuador and poisoned the natives. It was successful, and an Ecuadorian court awarded the plaintiffs a staggering $18 billion. Yes, BILLION. This was the biggest ever award in a civil court, but it was ALSO the biggest fraud in history.</p><p>Haven’t heard about it?? Funny. The same media that reported endlessly on the so-called “pollution” went pretty quiet when the case turned out to be a fraud. And a load of Hollywood celebrities who helped promote the fraud have also gone very quiet recently. Yes I'm talking about you Sting, Mia Farrow and Danny Glover.</p><p>The play shows how the plaintiffs, led by Donziger, bribed the judge and ghost wrote the judgment that awarded them this massive amount. And they were helped on their fraud by a cheerleading media that reported the allegations as fact but have been silent as the truth was revealed.</p><p>The scope of the fraud was enormous and at times farcical. Along with bribing judges, they used ludicrous code words to describe the top secret payments. It was all revealed when a New York court, realizing that something was amiss, ordered Donziger to hand over his files. In those files and diaries, Donziger admitted illegal bribes to judges and court officials as he wondered if he had “done a deal with the devil.”</p><p>The play reveals all the incredible details, and we have an amazing cast with Richard Kuhlman directing. He loves the play and has already made some stunning changes and suggestions. It is hilarious in places, revealing the madness and hypocrisy of the celebrities who went to Ecuador to “support the natives.” It turns some of them were secretly paid an absolute fortune, and you will laugh and cry when you see how they behaved when they thought the cameras were switched off. They also didn't know it was all recorded in his files by Steven Donziger.</p><p><i><strong>The $18-Billion Prize</strong></i> reveals the dark side of the environmental movement, where campaigners such as Donziger go to remote locations and use locals as props in their ideological war against American corporations. In one of the most outrageous examples, Donziger secretly fought and stopped the Ecuadorian government from cleaning up their pollution because it wouldn’t look good for his case. Donziger was also going to become very rich in the process. He stood to pocket $1.2 billion before the fraud was uncovered.</p><p>I’d love for you to come and see the play. You can buy a ticket through Indiegogo by going to ChevronPlay.com. But I need your help to ensure this play gets on stage and the truth gets out there. The theater establishment and the mainstream media don’t want this play to succeed. They want to cover up the story, and they certainly won’t fund it or support it. That’s why I’m crowdfunding. </p><p>Many of you have been supportive of my projects in the past. We broke world records with the Gosnell movie, and the <i>FERGUSON</i> Play made it on stage despite the best attempts of those who wanted it to disappear--nine members of the cast walking out during rehearsals. They do not want the truth out. That’s why crowdfunding is so important. </p><p>I need $75,000 to ensure the play gets on stage and continues its run.

Formed by <strong>Marina Raskova - a Russian Amelia Earhart -</strong> it was the only unit to remain <strong>exclusively female </strong>throughout the war. In the dead of night, they flew repurposed crop dusting biplanes to bomb Nazi forces on the front lines. These girls worked as pilots, navigators, mechanics, armorers, and <u><strong>operated continuously without break, rest, or leave for three years</strong></u> of the war. Flying against the Luftwaffe in open-cockpit biplanes with no radios, parachutes, or armor, they saw many of their friends - as well as their foes - fall to Earth in flames. Performing over <strong>24,000 missions,</strong> the regiment was awarded <strong>Elite Guards Status</strong> and 24 of them were awarded the highest distinction in the country, the <strong>Hero of the Soviet Union </strong>medal.</p><p>Stories of the Night Witches and their deeds were largely suppressed and forgotten after the war. <i>“Do not talk about the services you rendered, let others do it for you,"" </i>were the words uttered by then President Kalinin to the women who served and suffered for their country. Soviet records are scarce but according to histories compiled by the women pilots after the war, <strong>112 of them flew to the front. Over thirty of them were killed in action.</strong></p><p><strong>Women’s Air Force Service Pilot </strong>(WASP) Anne Noggle interviewed dozens of Night Witches in the early 90s and compiled their stories into her book: <i>A Dance With Death.</i> In her conclusion, she remarks, <i>“They had gathered as a remembrance, a celebration. They are sisters, they will tell you - closer to one another than to their own relatives. Ultimately their memento mori is one of survival, haunted by ghosts of those not so fortunate.”</i></p><p> </p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503932150/o3nhszad28cd5tsephij.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h2><ul>

*To read more about our ensemble members, visit our website. We’ve Achieved Phase 1!We developed Night Witches during a month-long residency on Ground Rush Farm in Culpeper, Virginia. An all female team of theatre artists worked tirelessly for 3 weeks to create this hour and a half play from scratch, utilizing conventional realism, physical theatre, music, dance, acro-yoga, and shadow puppetry. We were then fortunate enough to share our play with audiences at Lynchburg College and Culpeper residents in an airplane hangar on the farm. In New York, we held an invitation-only workshop performance at the famous William Esper Studio. As a company, we strive to share this story with a diverse group of people– from New York theatre-goers to small town farmers who have never been to the theatre before. The story of these women’s bravery is compelling for everyone!Phase I Checklist:
Met with members of the 99’s - the International Organization of Female Pilots

 We've got some awesome gifts lined up as a THANK YOU for your generosity! Stuff that you'll actually want! With products from start-up's founded by women, to feminist companies, to small Etsy shops. We've got you covered :)  Night Witches is the story of the brave female members of the Soviet air force and their dramatic efforts against the Nazis during World War II. Inspired by Anne Noggle’s A Dance with Death, a compilation of the women’s direct accounts of their own vivid memories. The play introduces glimpses of pre-war life, the unrelenting rigors of war, and the lasting power of sisterhood. These women, the first ever to fly in combat, proved that they could be among the best of warriors and equal to their male counterparts. From inexperienced girls - many of them teenagers - to hardened pilots. To each other, they were sisters. To many of their male comrades, they were a waste of army resources. To the Germans, however, they remained the Night Witches.A sneak peek at our Costume Design mood board - farmer meets aviation  (Ground Rush Productions LLC)With some research under our belts and a whole lot of determination, we packed our bags and traveled to Culpeper, VA. For one month we lived, cooked, laughed, cried, and created together. It was an intense experience and challenging on our hearts, souls, and bodies - working well over 9 hours a day. The Night Witches and their friendships is the basis to our own personal bonds that will last a life-time. So much of Night Witches was inspired by the farms' landscape, post-dinner conversations, and everyday farm life. The 588th Night Bomber Aviation Regiment was one of three female Soviet units during World War II. Formed by Marina Raskova - a Russian Amelia Earhart - it was the only unit to remain exclusively female throughout the war. In the dead of night, they flew repurposed crop dusting biplanes to bomb Nazi forces on the front lines. These girls worked as pilots, navigators, mechanics, armorers, and operated continuously without break, rest, or leave for three years of the war. Flying against the Luftwaffe in open-cockpit biplanes with no radios, parachutes, or armor, they saw many of their friends - as well as their foes - fall to Earth in flames. Performing over 24,000 missions, the regiment was awarded Elite Guards Status and 24 of them were awarded the highest distinction in the country, the Hero of the Soviet Union medal.Stories of the Night Witches and their deeds were largely suppressed and forgotten after the war. “Do not talk about the services you rendered, let others do it for you,"" were the words uttered by then President Kalinin to the women who served and suffered for their country. Soviet records are scarce but according to histories compiled by the women pilots after the war, 112 of them flew to the front. Over thirty of them were killed in action.Women’s Air Force Service Pilot (WASP) Anne Noggle interviewed dozens of Night Witches in the early 90s and compiled their stories into her book: A Dance With Death. In her conclusion, she remarks, “They had gathered as a remembrance, a celebration. They are sisters, they will tell you - closer to one another than to their own relatives. Ultimately their memento mori is one of survival, haunted by ghosts of those not so fortunate.”

</p><p><b>Our Story</b><br/></p><p>We are raising money to improve our
community Auditorium in Ajijic, a small village of 10,000 people in western Mexico.
The Auditorium is 40 years old and the local government does not have any money
to keep it in good repair. Our current project is to upgrade the air conditioning
because it is old, very noisy, and doesn’t cool down the building.</p><b>The Impact<br/><br/></b>
<p>The auditorium meets a huge community
need. School graduations are held here. In the evenings it is used for
dramatic, musical, folkloric dance, and mariachi shows.</p><p>Most days the sun beats
down on the roof all day and it gets pretty hot in there. The local audiences
have been waiting many years for an improvement in the air conditioning system.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444880181/cdutvxnhag5uevrkxmvt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>Evening intermission crowd outside the Auditorium</i><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Who's Organizing this?</b></p>

Three years ago we successfully obtained Mexican federal assistance for a program to significantly improve the interior acoustics. We are still working to improve the lighting, sound, and the seating (representing future budget needs for $25,000 USD). Our volunteer design consultant is

community Auditorium in Ajijic, a small village of 10,000 people in western Mexico.
The Auditorium is 40 years old and the local government does not have any money
to keep it in good repair. Our current project is to upgrade the air conditioning
because it is old, very noisy, and doesn’t cool down the building.The Impact
The auditorium meets a huge community
need. School graduations are held here. In the evenings it is used for
dramatic, musical, folkloric dance, and mariachi shows.Most days the sun beats
down on the roof all day and it gets pretty hot in there. The local audiences
have been waiting many years for an improvement in the air conditioning system.Evening intermission crowd outside the AuditoriumWho's Organizing this?
It’s organized by Pro Auditorio, a
registered non-profit whose only purpose is to improve the Ajijic Auditorium.
Three years ago we successfully obtained Mexican federal assistance for a program to significantly improve the interior acoustics. We are still working to improve the lighting, sound, and the seating (representing future budget needs for $25,000 USD). Our volunteer design consultant is
retired architect Thom Weeks who has extensive performance-space remodeling
experience.Our technical advisors: Engineer Daniel Ruvalcaba (Quorum Acoustics) and Architect Thom Weeks.
Technical Details of this Project
To isolate the exterior noises from
trucks and near-by band concerts we will build solid ducts for both air supply and the extraction lines, complete with sound-absorbing linings. We will recondition the cooling and extraction equipment and
upgrade the noisy bearings. These are the pieces of equipment that will be reconditioned, and the ducts that will be replaced as part of this project.Project Cost
Construction of new ducts and
reconditioning of the mechanical equipment will cost $18,000 USD. We have in
the bank $8,000 USD from our annual fund-raising ‘Lip Sync’ show. We need to
raise the outstanding balance of $10,000 USD in order to complete this project.Our Annual Lip Sync FundraiserEvery year in January, 
Michael McLaughlin produces and directs the Lip Sync show which has become
 the biggest and oldest Lip Sync anywhere. It is light-hearted and 
popular. All the proceeds go to benefit the Auditorium, but they are not
 enough to cover the projects we want to complete. That's the reason for
 this campaign.

In order to achieve this, we hold talk-back discussions after several of our shows. We strive to champion rarely performed operatic works while advocating social change and providing Chicago's emerging artists with performance opportunities.

Therefore, we have to rely heavily on individual giving for a large part of our funding. We hope you will believe in what we want to achieve and will contribute as generously as you can.

<h3>The Opportunity</h3>
<p>Computers that freeze up, cameras
that malfunction, printers that jam – These are just a few of the problems
faced when you run a charity with very limited resources.  But with some gum, spit and tape we
don’t complain at HIV Experience Resources Organization, (HERO).  Our efforts to support people who are newly
diagnosed and people living with HIV/AIDS is an act of love.  HERO supports the services and
fundraising efforts of all HIV related charities and we don’t do much
fundraising to help us keep doing what we do.  So why do we need your help?  We are putting on a show! On October 26, 2015 HERO will present the Second Annual Broadway and Ballet HERO Awards at Stage 48 in New York City.</p>
<p>This year’s event will feature 14 amazing performances from stars of Broadway and Ballet who have joined together to fight against HIV/AIDS.  In 2015 we will honor the work of GMHC (Gay Men’s Health Crisis.  The Broadway HERO award will be presented to Tony Award Winner and four-time Grammy nominated Legend, Melba Moore.  And, the John Adams Hero Award will go to Garen Price Scribner, starring in <i>An American In Paris,</i> for best Broadway Debut.  Melba Moore and Garen Price Scribner will perform at the event.  Last year's event was a big success.  We honored Tony Award Winner Jerry Mitchell, the work of The Actors Fund and Ballet Star, Stephen Hanna.  This year, with your help, we do better and knock it out of the park.  </p>

<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>We are the little charity that could.  Since 2009, HERO has been helping provide information and assistance for people newly diagnosed and people living with HIV/AIDS.  We need to get the word out about our resources.  The Broadway and Ballet HERO awards will generate much needed press about what we do and how we can help.<p>In addition, this event promotes the amazing talent of the Broadway and Ballet communities.  We have enlisted so much talent - singers, choreographers, dancers and comics.  We will be filming all of these on-of-a-kind performances and then sharing it with the world on our websites, YouTube channel, social Media, and our partners.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>As you may know, producing an event
like this takes money.  No one gets
paid at HERO and all the performers, stage crew, marketing services and video
producers have graciously donated their time.  But there are expenses that we just can’t manage to get
donated.  Your generous donation
will also allow us to pay for venue rental, posters, flyers, donation cards and
equipment rental, and equipment upgrades,  </p>
<p>The funds we raise from the Broadway
and Ballet HERO Awards will allow us to finally do a redesign and upgrade of
our website, and to attend and report from HIV/AIDS related conferences.  In addition, money raised will pay for
expenses involved in covering HIV/related events and providing services free of
charge to all partner organizations.  To date, HERO has
produced over 500 videos to help stop the spread of HIV/AIDS.</p>

The objectives of Lipstick Theatre are to produce dramatic works written by female playwrights, have strong female characters, have a largely female-based ensemble, or address women’s issues.</p><h2><b>Tell me about 5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche!</b></h2><p>5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche, written by Evan Linder and Andrew Hobgood, premiered in 2011 at The New Colony in Chicago, Illinois. Since then, it has enjoyed several successful productions in cities across the country. This March, Lipstick Theatre is bringing the show to Northwestern’s campus, with a semi-immersive production in the historic Shanley Pavilion. Every audience member will be an attendee of the 1956 Quiche Breakfast hosted by the Susan B. Anthony Society for the Sisters of Gertrude Stein. The meeting will be business as usual, until the ladies suddenly find themselves trapped in their community center indefinitely. Secrets start to come out and all the rules that bind these mid-20th century women together fly out the quadruple-paned window. It’s a sight to see.</p><h2>Why should I support 5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche?</h2><p>5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche will be a breath of fresh air on the Northwestern theatre scene. Its fast-paced antics and satire are of a genre rarely seen in student theatre. Also rarely seen are shows that feature a complete cast of fully-formed female characters. The play explores parts of the female experience and the queer experience in an honest and entertaining manner. The play also sheds new light on a dark part of American history: the fear that loomed underneath the idyllic image of the 1950s. Quiche will be Lipstick Theatre’s first production as an official member of the Northwestern Student Theatre Coalition, and we couldn’t be more excited to continue Lipstick’s mission with this exciting piece!</p><h2>Where does the money go?</h2><p>All donations go to major design elements that, put together, will bring the world of the show to life.

The objectives of Lipstick Theatre are to produce dramatic works written by female playwrights, have strong female characters, have a largely female-based ensemble, or address women’s issues.Tell me about 5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche!5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche, written by Evan Linder and Andrew Hobgood, premiered in 2011 at The New Colony in Chicago, Illinois. Since then, it has enjoyed several successful productions in cities across the country. This March, Lipstick Theatre is bringing the show to Northwestern’s campus, with a semi-immersive production in the historic Shanley Pavilion. Every audience member will be an attendee of the 1956 Quiche Breakfast hosted by the Susan B. Anthony Society for the Sisters of Gertrude Stein. The meeting will be business as usual, until the ladies suddenly find themselves trapped in their community center indefinitely. Secrets start to come out and all the rules that bind these mid-20th century women together fly out the quadruple-paned window. It’s a sight to see.Why should I support 5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche?5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche will be a breath of fresh air on the Northwestern theatre scene. Its fast-paced antics and satire are of a genre rarely seen in student theatre. Also rarely seen are shows that feature a complete cast of fully-formed female characters. The play explores parts of the female experience and the queer experience in an honest and entertaining manner. The play also sheds new light on a dark part of American history: the fear that loomed underneath the idyllic image of the 1950s. Quiche will be Lipstick Theatre’s first production as an official member of the Northwestern Student Theatre Coalition, and we couldn’t be more excited to continue Lipstick’s mission with this exciting piece!Where does the money go?All donations go to major design elements that, put together, will bring the world of the show to life. Each piece of the puzzle is absolutely vital in making the show what it is.Set and Space: We are immersing audience members in the world of the show by turning Shanley Pavilion into a 1950s community center.  We will be playing with interior decorating, creating different set pieces, and making sure the audience is as close to the action as possible.Lights: The tone of the show shifts from scene to scene, and as it does, the lighting keeps up with the play’s fast-paced action. Subtlety is not the word we’re looking for.Sound: There is a crazy world outside the community center and a crazy world inside it, and our sound team is working to create cues for impactful moments in the space.Props: Because the show is so immersive, props are absolutely vital to the world of the play, from the use of quiche, to the passing of nametags, and everything in between.Costumes: In order to recreate silhouettes and styles from the 1950s, our costume designer is both buying and sewing her own pieces. The production team will also be wearing 1950s-style accessories and outfits during each performance.Hair and Makeup: Partnering with our costume designer is our hair and makeup team, who will help display the unique personality of each officer in the Society.The Cast: Or, the Officers of the SocietyAbby Doermann – Lulie Stanwyck, PresidentMaddy Kelly – Wren Robin, Events ChairwomanKali Skatchke – Ginny Cadbury, SecretaryCarrie Caffrey – Dale Prist, HistorianEle Hagermoser – Veronica “Vern” Schultz, Buildings and Grounds ChairmanProduction and TeamRachel Holtzman  ProducerSydney Thomas  Space and Set DesignerConnor MacMillen  Lighting DesignerJim Alrutz  Sound DesignerJon Mathias  Dramaturg, Assistant Sound DesignerSophia Sinsheimer  Costume DesignerStefani Amick  Co-Hair and Makeup DesignerMadisen Hursey  Co-Hair and Makeup DesignerJason Yuan  Graphic DesignerTBA  Properties DesignerNat Kier      Fundraising DirectorAllison Towbes      Publicity DirectorJoy Holden  Outreach Coordinator, Business Officer-at-LargeRehearsal TeamHale McSharry      DirectorTaylor Stark      Assistant DirectorAlina Carrel  Stage ManagerShowtimes:Thursday, March 3rdFriday, March 4thSaturday, March 5thLocation: 5 Lesbians eating a Quiche will be performed in Shanley Pavilion located at 2031 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL.Tickets:Tickets are available at the door: $5 for Northwestern Students and $10 for General Public.I want to support this, but I’m having trouble donating through Indiegogo?!Send cash and checks made out to Northwestern University!You can send checks to:Rachel Holtzman1870 Orrington AveEvanston, IL 60201If you are unable to contribute monetarily, you can also help us out by sharing the link to this page!

de Sally McLaureen"" dans son essentiel, cette fois, dans une version

<h3> Comment ?<br/>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Participer à une festival de cette envergure, cela demande des fonds... D'abord il aura fallu payer l'inscription au Fringe pour s'inscrire au programme du Festival d'Edimbourg... (4OO £ soient 520 euros environ) + réserver la salle en prépayant une partie (1300 euros) + réserver le logement en avançant déjà un peu plus de 1000 euros... Soient déjà environ 3000 euros d'avancés. A cela s'ajouteront : l'assurance pour le mois de représentations + les frais de technicien + la location de matériel + les flyers et affiches à imprimer + l'achat d'espaces publicitaires + les frais de transports + les frais de décors, costumes et autres en rapport avec la création du spectacle... Soient encore au moins 3000 euros nécessaires pour que le spectacle puisse voir le jour à Edimbourg... C'est pourquoi ce serait une aide formidable que vous apportiez votre pierre à l'édifice...<br/>
</li>
<li>En remerciement, vous serez crédités sur mon site web  et trouverez des contreparties en rapport avec le spectacle au gré des participations (mp3, affiches, pdf des partitions, places de spectacles, atelier d'écriture etc...). Pour avoir déjà plusieurs amis qui ont organisé des crowdfunding, je sais que ce sont souvent à travers les participations, en fonction des bourses de chacun, les gestes de soutien qui font chaud au cœur et qui donnent le courage d'avancer dans le processus de création. Car dans le spectacle vivant, comme à Edimbourg, chaque point réserve parfois des surprises et est souvent plus couteux que prévu, notamment ici parce qu'il faut aussi compter en £ et non en euros, ce qui augmente de 30 % la mise. Mais le jeu en vaut la chandelle.  </li>
<li>Et pour ceux qui souhaitent aussi participer activement, si le cœur vous en dit, merci de faire circuler l'information ! bouche à oreille, réseaux sociaux, déambulation en homme ou femme-sandwich avec les affiches du spectacle ou le nouveau costume du Fringe !... toutes les idées sont les bienvenues ! :-)</li>

But how many of those names do we know? </span></h2><p><span>The impulse for our play was born when our playwright and lead actress, Anna Baryshnikov, encountered a question at a women's empowerment fundraiser: just as we, in the present, find that the fact that women once did not have access to voting or higher education ludicrous, what in 2060 will women be shocked was once true in 2016?</span></p><p>The widely-known statistic that <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/life/inside_higher_ed/2015/09/support_for_one_in_five_campus_sexual_assault_statistic_spurs_college_action.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">1 in 5 women on college campuses report experiencing unwanted sexual contact</a> jumped into Anna's head and never quite left. She approached her friends from college, Brandon Powers and Seonjae Kim, two theatre directors who once participated in creating a devised show about campus sexual assault for their school’s (Northwestern University) freshman orientation. The three of them remembered the honest conversations that play sparked, and felt an urgent desire to revisit it through a different story.</p><p>Sexual assault on college campuses has been a heated topic in the news in the past few years. America has had to confront how survivors of sexual assault often feel that both the legal system and their academic institution fail to bring justice to their cases. Many of these survivors have bravely spoken up in various public ways about their experiences, gaining national attention.</p><p>But what we don't see on the news is what happens after they do. Their voices bring awareness and discussion to a  difficult issue - but are their own lives changed for the better? What happens to a young woman’s life after she becomes a symbol?</p><p>Meet Ella Maythorne, your average spirited freshman. When her Halloween night at a frat party goes terribly wrong, and both the school and the police authorities refuse to fight for her, Ella decides to take matters into her own iPhone, launching a social media campaign against her rapist. She is now the face of a national feminist movement, a poster child for campus sexual assault, an activist for the Instagram era, and a celebrity in her own right - but where does she go from there? </p><p>It’s a heavy topic, for sure, but also expect to have some fun: throughout the play we are launched into concert-like moments with classic Britney Spears that allow us access to Ella’s fantasies and nightmares. Anticipate lip syncing, hip hop dancing, as well as boldly comedic dialogue and dynamic film sequences to guide us through our heroine's triumph and turmoil. With all these elements, <i>The Essential Ella Maythorne</i> explores just how far a young woman has to go to be heard in this world.</p>Our show was recently selected to perform on the mainstage of <b><i>Dixon Place on February 19th,</i></b> a venerable New York institution and supporter of new work. To make that happen, we need your help! <div>

<div>
<p><span>We get it. End of 2015 just happened, you donated to a bunch of charities, and this is yet another crowdfunding project. But hear us out:</span></p>
<p>Our show on February 19th will be the World Premiere, so the possibilities of where our little show could go is endless. We want to present a fresh and fantastic first draft of our show so it can have a future, and you will have been there from the beginning.</p>
<p>The cast and creative team will be comprised of entirely young, emerging artists, and this will be one of their first opportunities to present original work in New York. Think of this as a not only supporting a show but supporting the launch of many exciting careers in the arts.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope to both raise awareness and start conversations about an important, complicated issue, as well as make a really entertaining and moving piece of theater. We believe that those two things absolutely can, and should, go together. We want to utilize every moment of the process, including this Indiegogo page, to bring people together raise difficult questions.</p>
<p>If any of these reasons appeal to you, consider supporting us, even if it's just a few dollars. No donation is too small. </p>

</div></div>","1 in 5 women on college campuses report experiencing sexual violence. But how many of those names do we know? The impulse for our play was born when our playwright and lead actress, Anna Baryshnikov, encountered a question at a women's empowerment fundraiser: just as we, in the present, find that the fact that women once did not have access to voting or higher education ludicrous, what in 2060 will women be shocked was once true in 2016?The widely-known statistic that 1 in 5 women on college campuses report experiencing unwanted sexual contact jumped into Anna's head and never quite left. She approached her friends from college, Brandon Powers and Seonjae Kim, two theatre directors who once participated in creating a devised show about campus sexual assault for their school’s (Northwestern University) freshman orientation. The three of them remembered the honest conversations that play sparked, and felt an urgent desire to revisit it through a different story.Sexual assault on college campuses has been a heated topic in the news in the past few years. America has had to confront how survivors of sexual assault often feel that both the legal system and their academic institution fail to bring justice to their cases. Many of these survivors have bravely spoken up in various public ways about their experiences, gaining national attention.But what we don't see on the news is what happens after they do. Their voices bring awareness and discussion to a  difficult issue - but are their own lives changed for the better? What happens to a young woman’s life after she becomes a symbol?Meet Ella Maythorne, your average spirited freshman. When her Halloween night at a frat party goes terribly wrong, and both the school and the police authorities refuse to fight for her, Ella decides to take matters into her own iPhone, launching a social media campaign against her rapist. She is now the face of a national feminist movement, a poster child for campus sexual assault, an activist for the Instagram era, and a celebrity in her own right - but where does she go from there? It’s a heavy topic, for sure, but also expect to have some fun: throughout the play we are launched into concert-like moments with classic Britney Spears that allow us access to Ella’s fantasies and nightmares. Anticipate lip syncing, hip hop dancing, as well as boldly comedic dialogue and dynamic film sequences to guide us through our heroine's triumph and turmoil. With all these elements, The Essential Ella Maythorne explores just how far a young woman has to go to be heard in this world.Our show was recently selected to perform on the mainstage of Dixon Place on February 19th, a venerable New York institution and supporter of new work. To make that happen, we need your help! 


Where's My Money Going?





Approx. $1,600 to pay our creative team and actors.



Approx. $1,900 for space rentals and other rehearsal expenses.*
Approx. $500 to cover props/costumes and marketing costs.
Approx. $500 to cover other administrative costs and videography/photography.*
If we raise up to $5,000, we will use the surplus funds to pay our cast and team more for their hard work. We believe that artists should be paid. 
If we raise more than $5,500, we will donate the surplus funds to RAINN. 

We are working hard to further reduce production costs, through the generosity of our friends in NYC (We've already received generous support from La Mama Experimental Theatre Club). If in lieu of a monetary donation, you would like to support us by hooking us up with some free/low-cost rehearsal space, printing, props and costume rentals, email us!
Your support will be instrumental to making this small but mighty production happen.
Why Us?

We get it. End of 2015 just happened, you donated to a bunch of charities, and this is yet another crowdfunding project. But hear us out:
Our show on February 19th will be the World Premiere, so the possibilities of where our little show could go is endless. We want to present a fresh and fantastic first draft of our show so it can have a future, and you will have been there from the beginning.
The cast and creative team will be comprised of entirely young, emerging artists, and this will be one of their first opportunities to present original work in New York. Think of this as a not only supporting a show but supporting the launch of many exciting careers in the arts.
Finally, we hope to both raise awareness and start conversations about an important, complicated issue, as well as make a really entertaining and moving piece of theater. We believe that those two things absolutely can, and should, go together. We want to utilize every moment of the process, including this Indiegogo page, to bring people together raise difficult questions.
If any of these reasons appeal to you, consider supporting us, even if it's just a few dollars. No donation is too small. 

Even More Ways You Can Help!

Save the date for our performance on the Dixon Place mainstage, February 19th at 10pm! Tickets are inexpensive, especially if you buy ahead online. Bring your friends!
Spread the word on social media using #EssentialElla and following our Facebook event page. We would love to get a diverse (in every sense of the word) audience at our show, so please share away!
If you might be able to connect us with free/low cost rehearsal space, printing, or costumes/props rentals, please contact us at EssentialEllaMaythorne@gmail.com.
Finally, please take a moment to check out - and volunteer your time and money if you can - to some of these wonderful organizations doing the difficult and necessary work of supporting sexual assault survivors around the country: 

RAINN - Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network  (https://rainn.org)
Safe Horizon - NYC area specific victim servies agency (http://www.safehorizon.org/)
Not Alone - information for students, educators, survivors and advoates (https://www.notalone.gov/)
1 in 6 - Support for male survivors (https://1in6.org/)

Thank you so much for reading! Your support means the world to us.
Love,

<h3>WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT </h3>
<p>Between booking rehearsal and performance space, bringing our designers' ideas to life, marketing &amp; logistics, and most importantly, making sure our artists are compensated for their time and dedication, a great deal of money is required to fund our production. <br/><br/>The world of <i>The Cave</i> is an extravagant one, and our designers are doing the best they can to create low-budget designs, but in order to fully realize their visions, we will need financial support. Along with this, we have over 20 people working to bring this show to life. We need to show them how grateful we are for their dedication by compensating these incredible artists for their time. These are just some of the more specific places where money is being spent, but we pay for everything from printing scripts to marketing the show to renting out the theatre for the production. This production is not funded by any major investors, so your contribution, even if small, will make all the difference.

In an opium den at the turn of the 20th century, Willow sacrifices her life to pay off her father’s debt by working in an occult underground society called ""The Cave."" In this musical exploration of fairy tales, myths, and spiritualism, Willow fights to find light not only in the grim and strange shadow-world around her, but also within herself. 
The Cave: A Folk Opera, by Melanie Rose Thomas with direction by Christopher D. Betts and musical direction by Aaron Lindenberg, will have its New York City debut this March. With workshop productions at Sarah Lawrence College, Vassar College, and in London at The British American Drama Academy, The Cave: A Folk Opera has generated a following of emerging artists and received acclaim for its hypnotic form of storytelling and enchanting original music. The Cave is a new story inspired by the classic Beauty and the Beast fairy tale, and told entirely through original folk music. Using the format of an opera, along with folk music & highly poetic lyrical content, The Cave creates a mystical landscape of folklore and occultism. 






THE IMPACT


The Cave brings to light the relevance and depth of ancient stories, the muted female voices in the volatile history of women's sexuality, the search for redemption within addiction, and the struggle to find love within loss and sorrow. The funds raised here will support the development of this poignant piece.

<h3>About The Play</h3>
<p>It’s the end of the world.</p>
<p>A once-promising medication goes awry, mutating 51% of the world’s population into shells of human beings, with only the basic motor functions left to chase, bite, and kill. (Yep. They’re zombies.)</p>
<p>Three men, seemingly alone in the apocalypse, are honestly pretty all right with it. With all the women gone, they can finally kick back, relax, and get back to their men-only BBQ.</p>
<p>Until Alex—an intersex person who everyone assumes to be female—distorts the dichotomies in which these men view their black and white world. How is Alex alive? Is Alex’s life worth saving? And—ultimately—how can the men go about saving Alex when women are strictly against the BBQ rules?</p>
<p>In a quest for survival, adaptation is necessary. Will masculinity bend for a new world, or is the pull of routines of a lost time too strong to resist?</p>
<p>*This play was inspired by an actual list of BBQ rules that an actual man actually wrote. And yes, one of the rules is “no women.”</p>

<h3>Where Does The Money Go If We Exceed Our Goal Or Come in Under Budget?</h3>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p><strong><a href=""http://www.wanderlustonlocation.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wanderlust: Theatre on Location</a></strong> is a Tallahassee-based site-specific musical theatre company with the mission of <strong>reimagining local spaces through musical theatre to illuminate and celebrate community identity.</strong> Because each of our shows is staged site-specifically where the story actually takes place, Wanderlust presents the unique opportunity of reinvigorating community spaces as they provide essential, authentic backdrops and bring musicals to life.</p>
<p><br/>After last summer's sold-out run of our walking musical theatre experience <i><strong><a href=""https://www.tallahassee.com/story/entertainment/2019/07/13/wanderlust-touches-down-musicals-midtown/1707178001/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Musicals on the Move</a></strong> </i>in Midtown Tallahassee and a commissioned site-specific adaptation of <strong><a href=""https://www.tallahassee.com/story/life/chronicle/2019/12/11/carol-comes-thomasvilles-annual-victorian-christmas/4374665002/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>A Christmas Carol</i> </a></strong>for Thomasville's Victorian Christmas festival, Wanderlust unfortunately had to cancel our planned immersive summer 2020 production of <i>Into the Woods</i> due to COVID-19, which was meant to be staged on location in the woods at historic Lichgate conservancy in July.</p>
<p>As a 501(c)3 performing arts organization, we operate through live performance, and our entire season of programming has to be reimagined in the face of COVID limitations in terms of gathering cast, crew, and audience.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>Like many artists coming to terms with this ever-changing landscape, Wanderlust is looking to adapt to find new ways to bring a site-specific theatre experience to Tallahassee that can be safely enjoyed amidst COVID-related restrictions. Thus, <strong>we are creating a pre-recorded, auditory walking theatre experience in conversation with the Frenchtown Heritage Trail, a set of thirteen historical sites that chronicle the story of Tallahassee's historic Black neighborhood.</strong> In cooperation and conversation with the neighborhood’s <strong><a href=""https://rileymuseum.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Riley House Museum</a></strong>, this socially distant, site-specific audio musical theatre experience will be downloadable for guests to experience safely at their own pace. <strong>Once on the Trail, guests will listen along to songs and stories based on the history of the very place they're standing! </strong>Creative work will be based on oral histories and research conducted by the Riley House Museum.</p>
<p>Original music will be composed by <strong>Tallahassee-based artist and activist <a href=""https://www.roycelovett.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Royce Lovett</a></strong>, who appeared on the last season of NBC's <i>The Voice</i>. Lovett will also sample music from local musicians, such as the late Darryl Steele, a lifetime Frenchtown resident and iconic Blues Trail musician. Connective storytelling text will be created by local poetry collective <strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/blackonblackrhyme/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Black on Black Rhyme</a></strong>.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Wanderlust is committed to creating a space where diverse voices and experiences, courageous discourse, and community engagement are not only valued but essential to our shared success and growth.</p>
<p>Our project will celebrate the rich and fascinating history of Frenchtown, Tallahassee's historic Black neighborhood. <strong>We aim to raise awareness of the area's unique history through musical storytelling and promoting foot traffic to the area &amp; its local businesses through our socially-distant auditory theatre experience.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The entire creative output of the project will be commissioned work by exclusively local Black artists. </strong>Mr. Lovett, who will be writing the music, will work closely with students from Griffin Middle School &amp; Godby High School to include the talents and voices of young Frenchtown residents in the creative process of the project.</p>
<p>Amidst the changing realities brought by COVID-19, Wanderlust has been rethinking how we may continue to create site-specific theatre that celebrates our diverse community and illuminates local identity, all the while keeping our guests safe and socially-distanced. <strong>This bespoke project is designed FOR the community, BY the community.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Our Challenges</h3>
<p>As a live performing arts organization, our entire mode of operation has virtually been rendered untenable by COVID-19. Presently, we cannot gather collaborative artists or host audiences at live productions, so we are creatively adapting to these new realities by creating cultural arts experiences that can be safely enjoyed by the community based on social distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>As noted in the project description, The Frenchtown Project will be pre-recorded and<br/>accessible to the community to download for free and enjoy at their leisure while walking the<br/>outdoor Frenchtown Heritage Trail.</p>
<p><br/>As we await the future fate of live performances, Wanderlust is forging ahead with the creation of new works that keep audiences safe while still providing essential artistic engagement. We have no idea when theatre may return in its traditional form, and we seek to innovate new ways to bring the arts to the Tallahassee community.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How Funds Will Be Used</h3>
<p>All donations will be put towards the commissioning of talented Black artists who will be creating this experience,  as well as providing local Frenchtown youth an opportunity to collaborate with professional artists.  Funds will also support production costs associated with recording and producing the music, paying local musicians, and marketing costs.</p>
<p><strong>We are nearly halfway to our funding goal for this project, but we still need your help to bring this vital work to life! We appreciate donations large and small from both individuals and potential corporate sponsors.</strong></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>No More Toys is written and directed by me, Pierce Minor, a Los Angeles based writer, director and actor (Adopt a Highway, Book Club, How to Get Away With Murder). My professional background is mainly rooted in writing and acting for film, television, and commercials, but theater has always been my first love and foundation. I’ve also directed several festival recognized short films, including “Little Brown Baby” (2017), and my latest short, “Deity,” which will premiere later this year. Having been away from the stage since my 2014 roles in “The Dark Side of the Moon” and “Do Angels Sing the Blues” in Los Angeles, I am very eager to dig back into stagework with No More Toys - also my theatrical directing debut.</p>
<p>No More Toys began as a feature film script, taking place in mostly all one location. It has since evolved into a stage play, and has attracted a talented LA cast to help me bring it to life: Luis Garcia (Jesus and Moi, Homeward Los Angeles), Anthony D. Washington (S.W.A.T., Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.), Crystal Coreen (Broken Minds, Death Pool), Arlene Victoria Conrad (The Spectrum, Leo), Danice Cabanela (The Debt Collector, Forget Me Nots), Chidi Ohaeri (Six Degrees of Separation), and Jamal Henderson (Finding Home, Past and Presence).</p>
<p>Produced by myself and Michelle Roshanzamir, this ensemble drama is looking to add its mark to the already exciting and steady growing Hollywood Fringe Festival community. And we want YOU to be a part of it!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Synopsis of No More Toys</h3>
<p>After a successful presentation, Todd, a local college recruiter, returns to a high school classroom to retrieve his forgotten baseball cap.  Upon arrival, he realizes that something is off - and that one of the students is out of place. Todd doesn’t take the hint to leave and suddenly finds himself held hostage by the disgruntled student in the room.</p>
<h3>Why Fringe?</h3>
<p>Started in 2010 by Founder Ben Hill and other organizers, “the Hollywood Fringe Festival is an annual, open-access, community-derived event celebrating freedom of expression and collaboration in the performing arts community.</p>
<p>Each June during the Hollywood Fringe, the arts infiltrate the Hollywood neighborhood: fully equipped theaters, parks, clubs, churches, restaurants and other unexpected places host hundreds of productions by local, national, and international arts companies and independent performers.” (<a href=""https://www.hollywoodfringe.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.hollywoodfringe.org</a>)</p>
<p>In addition, the Fringe is a great place for artists to try out new material in front of an audience.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The total cost of the show is about $3,500.  It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Venue rental for 5 shows</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Hollywood Fringe Registration</li>
<li>Rehearsal Space &amp; Tech</li>
<li>Production Tech Expenses</li>
<li>Set/Prop Expenses</li>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Stories have always had the capacity to bring people together, and theater is one way to do so.  While the Hollywood Fringe Festival has provided a space for creatives to present their work, it has also continued to provide a way for the Los Angeles community to have access to theater at an affordable price point.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As always, as with much in the arts, theater can be a risky investment.  HOWEVER. It’s something that’s real and is happening right in front of you.  It provides connection and an experience in a world that’s continuing to be technologically driven.  Theater provides a great way to connect in real time with friends, family, colleagues and the world around us.</p>

Following the reading, audiences and artists will enjoy a reception and continue discussing the the play, its past development and future.</p><p>Originally written in 1928 and unproduced for almost a century, <strong><i>Adam The Creator </i>and the Čapeks are long overdue a presence in the American theatre. </strong></p><p> </p><h3>Who is Adam The Creator?<strong><i>A Synopsis:</i></strong>
</h3><p>Adam, out of frustration with the corrupt state of humanity, takes to the public square where he negates all of existence and is then charged with the re-creation of the universe. Adam ventures to build a new, better world by attempting to create the ideal man, woman, and companion from a pile of clay and the breath of life. Grappling with the inherent struggles that come with implementing his ideals in reality, he creates his own Alter Ego, who in turn engages him in a challenge to create the ideal society. Soon after, Adam and Alter Ego lose control of their creations who are now at war with each other for ultimate power. Years later, Adam and Alter Ego return to the scene of their creation to learn that though they are being worshipped, they have not managed to improve the condition of the human race. Through his attempt to create a quintessential society from his own solitary existence, Adam glimpses the inherent value of life and the beauty of humanity despite all its flaws.</p><h3>How’d We Get Here:</h3><p>In 2015, Megan and I determined that Karel and Josef Čapek’s<i> Adam The Creator </i>is too important and too good to be ignored any longer. With only one english translation in 1931 London, we began creating a new adaptation. As theatre artists ourselves, we were able to streamline cast size and length to increase the play’s producibility in the contemporary theatre and sociopolitical landscape. </p><p>Additionally, we realized the play's growing relevance to our current world. By adapting the text, we’ve renewed the spirit and themes of the Čapek’s original text in a uniquely American voice. In doing so, we’ve created an intercultural dialogue as relevant in 2019 America, as it was in 1928 Czechoslovakia.</p><h3>Who We Are: <i>Pete Danelski &amp; Megan Diehl</i>
</h3><p>Both graduates of DeSales University, Megan and I have been working in professional theatre on several fronts, while creating a creative partnership along the way. Together we have the skills to bring <i>Adam The Creator</i> to a new audience:</p><p><strong>Megan Diehl</strong> is a playwright and director with a background in creating and developing new theatre. She is also the Advancement &amp; Communications Manager with the Pennsylvania Shakespeare Festival. Megan holds a masters degree from Villanova University.</p><p><strong>Pete Danelski</strong> is a DC based writer, director and theatre maker. He has worked throughout Pennsylvania and DC. Pete is a 2019 Director-in-Residence with the Drama League of New York City, where he will develop an original play. He is also Business and Operations Associate with CulturalDC, producing work across DC. Pete holds a masters from Trinity College Dublin.</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What We Promise:</h3><p>We understand contributing is not always easy. Any donation is welcome, however <strong>we believe in the power of small individual contributions.</strong> <u><strong>If just over 30 supporters contribute $30 each, we'll easily make our goal.</strong></u> The progress we've seen so far has been made possible only by individuals in the US and Prague who share our commitment to this work. <strong>We are dedicated to growing our circle of supporters.</strong> </p><p><strong>Your support will ensure <i>Adam The Creator</i> receives the high-quality DC debut it deserves.</strong> $1000 of support will fund:</p><ul>

Years later, Adam and Alter Ego return to the scene of their creation to learn that though they are being worshipped, they have not managed to improve the condition of the human race. Through his attempt to create a quintessential society from his own solitary existence, Adam glimpses the inherent value of life and the beauty of humanity despite all its flaws.How’d We Get Here:In 2015, Megan and I determined that Karel and Josef Čapek’s Adam The Creator is too important and too good to be ignored any longer. With only one english translation in 1931 London, we began creating a new adaptation. As theatre artists ourselves, we were able to streamline cast size and length to increase the play’s producibility in the contemporary theatre and sociopolitical landscape. Additionally, we realized the play's growing relevance to our current world. By adapting the text, we’ve renewed the spirit and themes of the Čapek’s original text in a uniquely American voice. In doing so, we’ve created an intercultural dialogue as relevant in 2019 America, as it was in 1928 Czechoslovakia.Who We Are: Pete Danelski & Megan Diehl
