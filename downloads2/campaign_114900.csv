<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>My name is Justyn Smith and I'm passionate about good storytelling. What's even better than good storytelling is storytelling with a great purpose. I'm married and a father to seven children. Like so many of us parents, we've been thrusted into navigating a new world. Just a few short months ago, we could all squeeze into a bus or tram practically falling over each other. We could have the occasional couch or sneeze sneak up on us giving us no time to cover our mouths and we'd get a gross look from others around us. Now, we're standing six-feet from anyone and it would be <i>code red</i> if anyone sneezed without covering up regardless if it wasn't on purpose.</p>
<p>If you're like many parents, we've had to explain and re-explain to your kids why we have to wear a mask in buildings and around people. Our kids don't get it--they keep taking them off or perhaps maybe they just quite don't get it yet. Our hope with this book is that this will be a fun and engaging way to get your young kids to understand they why of wearing a mask. It's fun, it's cute and informative.</p>

<p>The total cost for <i>Beave And His Mask</i> is $10,500. This covers the artwork (by the amazing Plainjoe Studios in Southern California), printing, custom face mask (same one Beave picks out in the book), Indiegogo fees and shipping.</p>
<p>For those funding $20, we'll mail you a book. The perks go up from there! We've got posters, a cutout Beave mask that can be printed at home and custom Beave face mask that you and your kids can wear around town and school.</p>

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>In this book, I try to break down Tony Stark’s suit into Lego pieces of some sort, and explore our successes and challenges in creating those pieces. I then look into cultural aspects that can help in putting those pieces together.<br/><br/>My name is Daria Stekolnikova and I am the author of The Flying Humans. I wrote this book because I have always been fascinated by Iron Man, especially his ability to fly. I wanted to explore this a bit more, and it led me to discover many other incredible things about the suit and the world around it.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the amazing ways science fiction can affect reality. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for our technological future in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand some of the ways in which scientists of today are choosing to make the world a better place.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about new horizons in the world of technology and how they can help create the suit:<ul>
<li>Who is joining the race for clean, virtually unlimited energy.</li>
<li>Why a group of students from Maryland university did not win $250,000.</li>
<li>How bad advertising can stagnate technical progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are excited for (or scared of) the future and would like to have a look at it.<br/><br/>The Flying Humans is a non-fiction book that speaks to youth and adults who are looking at physics and engineering for the first time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Book - The Flying Humans</strong></p>
<p>The book is written in two parts. However, it does not matter in which order you read them, or any of the chapters. It starts with, quite unexpectedly, an introduction. Then, there is a guide that the reader can use to make the most out of the following two parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains six chapters about the technical aspects of the Iron Man suit. In this part the reader will discover what prevents us from creating the suit right now, and what we are doing to fix that. I talk about nuclear fusion (30 years away, myth or reality?) and Tesla’s batteries among other things. Since those inventions are arguably even more fascinating when you understand what is going on, the reader will learn (or recognize) some physical concepts and equations.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains another six chapters that focus on more tactical nuances of bringing the suit to life. Here, I explore how the pop-cultural nature of Iron Man might affect the suit’s creation and talk about interesting examples of what inspires people to combat nature. The reader will meet Richard Browning (not sponsored, I swear), Aerovelo and others.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>
<p>My name is Daria Stekolnikova and I’m a physics major. I would be lying if I said that this decision was not affected by science fiction heroes like Doctor Who and Tony Stark. I am curious about how crazy physics concepts and new ideas can come to life through engineering.<br/><br/>I enjoy many things outside of physics. For example, I have strong passion for travelling (like any other person, I know). I was born in Russia, then moved to the US to finish last two years of high school at UWC-USA (a two-year international boarding school) in New<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> Mexico, and then moved to upstate New York for university. Currently, I am studying abroad in the UK, at the University of Bristol.</span></p>
<p><br/>I like to think that I am pretty good with natural sciences and math. On the other hand, learning languages has always been a struggle, which is very inconvenient. The only way I was able to speak English was because I didn’t have a choice. I don’t lose hope, however, so I have been trying to learn French for several years now. That is in contrast to my six year old brother, who speaks perfect Spanish and manages to not forget Russian.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Daria at dstekoln@u.rochester.edu and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/daria.stekolnikova"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/daria.stekolnikova</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>

</div><p>Thank you so much of all of your love and support!<br/><br/>Thanks again,<br/>Daria</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>История создания моей книги</strong><br/><br/>Меня зовут Дарья Стекольникова и я автор ""Летающих людей"". Почему такое название? Дело в том, что, я, как и многие, с детства увлечена вселенной Марвел, и моим любимым супергероем всегда был Железный Человек. Это единственный из героев, кто не имеет врожденных суперспособностей. Он все сделал сам: cвоим умом, своими руками. Он создал костюм для идеальной защиты и научился летать. Вот эта способность меня всегда особенно восхищала.<br/><br/>Конечно, пока это фантастика, но в какой-то момент мне стало интересно, насколько человечество приблизилось к тому, чтобы воплотить это в реальность. Что можно сделать уже сейчас и что ученым пока недоступно? Я стала исследовать эти вопросы. Я разобрала костюм Железного человека на составляющие, на ""детали ЛЕГО"" и стала изучать их по отдельности. Я стала выяснять, где в мире работают над похожими проблемами, какие успехи и сложности есть у современных ученых в достижении этих целей. И конечно, моё любопытство быстро вывело меня за рамки только лишь костюма Железного Человека. Все оказалось гораздо шире и интереснее.<br/><br/>Так получилась эта книга. Она об удивительном пути технологий от научной фантастики до реальности. О новых горизонтах, раскрывающихся перед человечеством. О многочисленных культурных аспектах, помогающих или мешающих достигать этих горизонтов в науке. Из неё вы узнаете например:</p><ul>
<li>Кто вступает в гонку за чистой, в сущности неограниченной энергией.</li>
<li>Почему группа студентов из Университета Мариленда не выйграла $250,000.</li>
<li>Как ошибки в рекламе могут замедлить технический прогресс.</li>
</ul><p>И многое другое. Вы познакомитесь с некоторыми способами, которые ученые используют, чтобы изменить мир к лучшему. С открытиями и исследованиями, которые приближают будущее. И если вы, как и я, не можете дождаться, когда наступит это будущее, в котором такие вещи как костюм Железного Человека станет реальностью, то эта книга - для вас.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Книга - “Летающие люди”</strong><br/><br/>Эта книга состоит из двух частей. Однако, не имеет значения, в какой последовательности вы будете их читать. Тоже самое относится и к отдельным главам - читатель может знакомится с ними в любом порядке.<br/><br/>Книга начинается, вы удивитесь, с введения. За ним следует гид по книге, который поможет читателю наиболее эффективно соорентироваться в каком порядке ему будет интереснее ознакомится с книгой.<br/><br/>Первая часть состоит из шести глав о технических аспектах создания костюма Железного Человека. В этой части вы узнаете о том, что отделяет нас от создания костюма прямо сейчас, и что современные ученые делают, чтобы это исправить. Я рассказываю о ядерном синтезе (правда ли, что он появится серез 30 лет?), батареях в машинах Тесла, и о многом другом. Интересная особенность этой части состоит в том, что я довольно часто объясняю физические процессы, потому что, по моему мнению, так многие изобретения становятся ещё удивительнее.<br/><br/>Вторая часть так же состоит из шести глав. В них я фокусируюсь на более тактических нюансах создания костюма. В этих главах я задумываюсь над тем, как происхождение Железного Человека из поп-культуры может повлиять но создание костюма: как это повлияет на восприятие такого изобретения публикой. Так же, в этой части я привожу примеры людей и компаний, таких как Ричард Браунинг и Аэровело, которые смогли покорить законы физики и расширить человеческие возможности.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Какая помощь мне нужна, и что я могу предложить взамен</strong><br/><br/>Книга будет выпущена издательством New Degree Press.

Story of My BookIn this book, I try to break down Tony Stark’s suit into Lego pieces of some sort, and explore our successes and challenges in creating those pieces. I then look into cultural aspects that can help in putting those pieces together.My name is Daria Stekolnikova and I am the author of The Flying Humans. I wrote this book because I have always been fascinated by Iron Man, especially his ability to fly. I wanted to explore this a bit more, and it led me to discover many other incredible things about the suit and the world around it.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the amazing ways science fiction can affect reality. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for our technological future in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand some of the ways in which scientists of today are choosing to make the world a better place.In this book, you'll learn about new horizons in the world of technology and how they can help create the suit:
Who is joining the race for clean, virtually unlimited energy.
Why a group of students from Maryland university did not win $250,000.
How bad advertising can stagnate technical progress.

You will love this book if you are excited for (or scared of) the future and would like to have a look at it.The Flying Humans is a non-fiction book that speaks to youth and adults who are looking at physics and engineering for the first time.
 
The Book - The Flying Humans
The book is written in two parts. However, it does not matter in which order you read them, or any of the chapters. It starts with, quite unexpectedly, an introduction. Then, there is a guide that the reader can use to make the most out of the following two parts.Part 1 contains six chapters about the technical aspects of the Iron Man suit. In this part the reader will discover what prevents us from creating the suit right now, and what we are doing to fix that. I talk about nuclear fusion (30 years away, myth or reality?) and Tesla’s batteries among other things. Since those inventions are arguably even more fascinating when you understand what is going on, the reader will learn (or recognize) some physical concepts and equations.Part 2 contains another six chapters that focus on more tactical nuances of bringing the suit to life. Here, I explore how the pop-cultural nature of Iron Man might affect the suit’s creation and talk about interesting examples of what inspires people to combat nature. The reader will meet Richard Browning (not sponsored, I swear), Aerovelo and others.
 
What I Need & What You'll Get This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:
The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in February 2020
The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!
The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)
The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication
The Launch & Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this in the Winter
When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a version in Russian. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.

I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:

You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish
A personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book
Your name will appear in a Special Acknowledgements section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”)
Early access to the Introduction of my book and my entire manuscript, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback
The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my cover
I will do a book topic/workshop seminar where I will share experience the experiences of writing my book
And more...

 
About the Author
My name is Daria Stekolnikova and I’m a physics major. I would be lying if I said that this decision was not affected by science fiction heroes like Doctor Who and Tony Stark. I am curious about how crazy physics concepts and new ideas can come to life through engineering.I enjoy many things outside of physics. For example, I have strong passion for travelling (like any other person, I know). I was born in Russia, then moved to the US to finish last two years of high school at UWC-USA (a two-year international boarding school) in New Mexico, and then moved to upstate New York for university. Currently, I am studying abroad in the UK, at the University of Bristol.
I like to think that I am pretty good with natural sciences and math. On the other hand, learning languages has always been a struggle, which is very inconvenient. The only way I was able to speak English was because I didn’t have a choice. I don’t lose hope, however, so I have been trying to learn French for several years now. That is in contrast to my six year old brother, who speaks perfect Spanish and manages to not forget Russian.For more information you can connect with Daria at dstekoln@u.rochester.edu and https://www.facebook.com/daria.stekolnikova.
 
Risks & Challenges

Thank you so much of all of your love and support!Thanks again,Daria  История создания моей книгиМеня зовут Дарья Стекольникова и я автор ""Летающих людей"". Почему такое название? Дело в том, что, я, как и многие, с детства увлечена вселенной Марвел, и моим любимым супергероем всегда был Железный Человек. Это единственный из героев, кто не имеет врожденных суперспособностей. Он все сделал сам: cвоим умом, своими руками. Он создал костюм для идеальной защиты и научился летать. Вот эта способность меня всегда особенно восхищала.Конечно, пока это фантастика, но в какой-то момент мне стало интересно, насколько человечество приблизилось к тому, чтобы воплотить это в реальность. Что можно сделать уже сейчас и что ученым пока недоступно? Я стала исследовать эти вопросы. Я разобрала костюм Железного человека на составляющие, на ""детали ЛЕГО"" и стала изучать их по отдельности. Я стала выяснять, где в мире работают над похожими проблемами, какие успехи и сложности есть у современных ученых в достижении этих целей. И конечно, моё любопытство быстро вывело меня за рамки только лишь костюма Железного Человека. Все оказалось гораздо шире и интереснее.Так получилась эта книга. Она об удивительном пути технологий от научной фантастики до реальности. О новых горизонтах, раскрывающихся перед человечеством. О многочисленных культурных аспектах, помогающих или мешающих достигать этих горизонтов в науке. Из неё вы узнаете например:
Кто вступает в гонку за чистой, в сущности неограниченной энергией.
Почему группа студентов из Университета Мариленда не выйграла $250,000.
Как ошибки в рекламе могут замедлить технический прогресс.
И многое другое. Вы познакомитесь с некоторыми способами, которые ученые используют, чтобы изменить мир к лучшему. С открытиями и исследованиями, которые приближают будущее. И если вы, как и я, не можете дождаться, когда наступит это будущее, в котором такие вещи как костюм Железного Человека станет реальностью, то эта книга - для вас. Книга - “Летающие люди”Эта книга состоит из двух частей. Однако, не имеет значения, в какой последовательности вы будете их читать. Тоже самое относится и к отдельным главам - читатель может знакомится с ними в любом порядке.Книга начинается, вы удивитесь, с введения. За ним следует гид по книге, который поможет читателю наиболее эффективно соорентироваться в каком порядке ему будет интереснее ознакомится с книгой.Первая часть состоит из шести глав о технических аспектах создания костюма Железного Человека. В этой части вы узнаете о том, что отделяет нас от создания костюма прямо сейчас, и что современные ученые делают, чтобы это исправить. Я рассказываю о ядерном синтезе (правда ли, что он появится серез 30 лет?), батареях в машинах Тесла, и о многом другом. Интересная особенность этой части состоит в том, что я довольно часто объясняю физические процессы, потому что, по моему мнению, так многие изобретения становятся ещё удивительнее.Вторая часть так же состоит из шести глав. В них я фокусируюсь на более тактических нюансах создания костюма. В этих главах я задумываюсь над тем, как происхождение Железного Человека из поп-культуры может повлиять но создание костюма: как это повлияет на восприятие такого изобретения публикой. Так же, в этой части я привожу примеры людей и компаний, таких как Ричард Браунинг и Аэровело, которые смогли покорить законы физики и расширить человеческие возможности. Какая помощь мне нужна, и что я могу предложить взаменКнига будет выпущена издательством New Degree Press. Представленные варианты предзаказа помогут мне покрыть расходы на публикацию. Собранные деньги пойдут на следующее:
Редактор с которым я работаю, чтобы опубликовать мою рукопись в феврале 2020.

Техническое редактирование книги, чтобы исправить все допущенные грамматические и синтаксические ошибки.
Выпуск и продвижение книги после того как она будет издана этой зимой.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Kristina Horton and I just finished writing a book called Far From Perfect: Insights into Living with Anxiety and Panic Disorders. </p>
<p>It describes, through my story, what it's like trying to live life while having anxiety and panic attacks. I wrote the book so that anyone dealing with these issues won't feel alone, and to help those that don't better understand what it's like. It also offers a handy Toolbox section full of helpful ways to manage the anxiety. </p>
<p>This book has been a two-year labor of love for me. I was called to write the book about four years ago but initially put it off because of fear that people would know my ""dirty little secret"" - that I was dealing with a mental illness. After hiding it for over 40 years, I came to realize that only by sharing my story and what I've learned would it have any value. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>I am self publishing, and am seeking $6,500 for consideration of costs for book cover art, professional editing, publishing house fees, formatting, 150 paperback copies, marketing expenses (website, catalog listing, book launch event), and writing mentorship fees. </p>
<p>Here are some exclusive rewards available for people who pre-order my book now: </p>
<ul>
<li>Acknowledgement on my website and social media. </li>
<li>A custom made bookmark. </li>
<li>Two inspirational mantra cards you can use to help during an anxiety or panic episode. </li>
<li>Personally signed copy of the paperback (except the eBook perk)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There is an increasing number of people hurting in silence because they are afraid to let others know that they're struggling with anxiety. Others are unsure of how to be around someone experiencing a panic attack or living with daily anxiety. With all the uncertainty currently going  on in the world, more and more people are being confronted with increased levels of anxiety or are dealing with it for the first time in their lives.

Hello! My name is Kristina Horton and I just finished writing a book called Far From Perfect: Insights into Living with Anxiety and Panic Disorders. 
It describes, through my story, what it's like trying to live life while having anxiety and panic attacks. I wrote the book so that anyone dealing with these issues won't feel alone, and to help those that don't better understand what it's like. It also offers a handy Toolbox section full of helpful ways to manage the anxiety. 
This book has been a two-year labor of love for me. I was called to write the book about four years ago but initially put it off because of fear that people would know my ""dirty little secret"" - that I was dealing with a mental illness. After hiding it for over 40 years, I came to realize that only by sharing my story and what I've learned would it have any value. 
 
What I Need & What You Get

I am self publishing, and am seeking $6,500 for consideration of costs for book cover art, professional editing, publishing house fees, formatting, 150 paperback copies, marketing expenses (website, catalog listing, book launch event), and writing mentorship fees. 
Here are some exclusive rewards available for people who pre-order my book now: 

Acknowledgement on my website and social media. 
A custom made bookmark. 
Two inspirational mantra cards you can use to help during an anxiety or panic episode. 
Personally signed copy of the paperback (except the eBook perk)

<h3>About this Project</h3>
<p>Worthiness is not something that we can learn from others. Rather, it is an awakening that must come from within. Worthiness is our birthright. Each one of us knows deep inside at our most true self that we are worthy.</p>
<p>So, how do we come to this radical realization? And why don’t many of us already know how worthy we are?</p>

<h3>Why This Book is Needed in the World</h3>
<p>My heart breaks every day witnessing so many women tell themselves things like, “I am unworthy,” “My perspective doesn’t matter,” and, “I am never going to be good enough.”</p>
<p>As a sensitive and soulful woman, I, too, walked through the world carrying these wounding beliefs about myself as a heavy burden.</p>
<p>The reality is that women have been carrying these beliefs for many generations, and thus, the wounds begin early in childhood and run very deep.</p>
<p>For a very long time, I believed that there was something wrong with me, and I looked everywhere outside myself for the answers to fix me. I didn’t find them.</p>
<p>Then one day, all of that changed… I began an inward journey to discover my true voice.</p>
<p>It wasn’t always easy. Confronting all the ways I had been cutting myself down and making myself small challenged me to my core.</p>
<p>But it was also so worth it! Because with each wounding belief that I healed and released, I discovered a new truth about who I really am. With each new truth, I took another step towards living the life that would bring me real happiness and fulfillment.</p>
<p>I invite you to come on a journey of self-discovery and revelation. Of deep, soul healing that will crack you wide open. In <strong><i>To Be Worthy</i></strong>, I share it all, from my struggles and heartache, to my greatest breakthrough moments.</p>
<p>And as you follow along, you’ll discover the truths behind your own wounding beliefs. About how uniquely worthy, powerful and gifted you are.</p>
<p>This is the book that I, once upon a time, so badly needed. It could have saved me from years of heartache and struggle. It is the book that I know will transform the lives of so many who struggle with their self-worth.</p>

I wrote this book for anyone interested in learning more about dinosaurs and what happened at the end of their reign.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will have a picture of the Late Cretaceous world and understand the horrors the dinosaurs experienced on the day the asteroid made impact upon the Earth. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for paleontology in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand why paleontologists continue to study prehistoric animals and what we have to learn from them.<br/><br/>In this book, you will follow the story of an <i>Acheroraptor</i> called Alpha and learn about the Earth as it was 65 million years ago. You will experience:</p><ul>
<li>A pack of raptors on the hunt and their confrontation with a larger predator</li>
<li>The impact of the asteroid and the 24 hours of hell on Earth that followed</li>
<li>The months after the impact and the factors that drove dinosaurs to extinction</li>
</ul><p>The information provided in this book has been gathered from paleontologists such as Dr. Jim Kirkland, Dr. Philip Currie, Dr. Thomas Holtz, Dr. Thomas Carr, and Dr. Penny Higgins and biologist Randall Ott as well as from multiple books and documentaries. This is currently our best theory as to what happened 65 million years ago.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are interested in dinosaurs and prehistory.</p><p><br/>Alpha is a realistic fiction book that speaks to people of all ages who are interested in learning more about prehistory and the catastrophic event that would allow mammals to take over as the dominant life forms and ultimately give rise to humans.</p><p> </p><h2>The Book - Alpha</h2><p> </p><p>The following is an excerpt from about halfway through the book, detailing the impact of the asteroid:<br/><br/><i>For now, Alpha is not worried. Her brain, though intelligent for a dinosaur, is not capable of worrying about future events. She bumps snouts with Beta and then settles her head down to go to sleep.<br/><br/>The light is blinding. It comes as suddenly as lightning during a thunderstorm. Followed soon after is another, even more blinding light to the south. The dinosaurs do not see the asteroid streak across the sky like all the disaster movies imply. One moment everything is fine, and then the next, everything is on fire.<br/><br/>Every dinosaur in North and South America turns their head in the direction of the light. Carnivores stop hunting and herbivores look up from their meals. Everything falls silent as primal birds stop chirping and mammals and insects stop moving to brace for what’s coming. The world is about to end.<br/><br/>The first light the dinosaurs saw was the asteroid entering the atmosphere of the Earth and the second is the impact itself. The blast will come later as sound travels at roughly 767 miles per hour and anything in the immediate vicinity that could hear the impact was dead instantly.<br/><br/>The asteroid struck the Yucatan Peninsula in the Gulf of Mexico, where it gouged a hole 30,000 feet deep and caused the rock of the Earth's crust to behave like a liquid for a split second. The power is equivalent to that of 100 million hydrogen bombs and it is even visible from the moon. The asteroid was vaporized instantly, but the sound it made was deafening when it reached the ears of the dinosaurs<br/><br/>All the water within a 100 mile radius of the impact is turned to steam and anything within a 250 mile radius is killed instantly. They could be considered the lucky ones.<br/><br/>As near as Alpha can tell, there is fire in the sky. Where one second it had been clear, the next there is a trail left behind by the asteroid. She is frozen by fear as other raptors turn to her for direction on how to face this new threat.<br/><br/>There is a monstrous roar, not of this world, as super-heated ash and rock race away from the impact zone just three seconds after the impact. Alpha and her pack have only seconds to act.<br/><br/>Millions of years of predatory instinct engraved in her DNA and only one, the most primal, rings true in Alpha's head: </i>Run.<br/> </p><h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2><p><br/>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p><ul>

</ul><p><br/>Thanks again,<br/>Jack Schneider</p></div>","Story of My BookAlphaMy name is Jack Schneider and I am the Author of Alpha. I wrote this book for anyone interested in learning more about dinosaurs and what happened at the end of their reign.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will have a picture of the Late Cretaceous world and understand the horrors the dinosaurs experienced on the day the asteroid made impact upon the Earth. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for paleontology in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand why paleontologists continue to study prehistoric animals and what we have to learn from them.In this book, you will follow the story of an Acheroraptor called Alpha and learn about the Earth as it was 65 million years ago. You will experience:
A pack of raptors on the hunt and their confrontation with a larger predator
The impact of the asteroid and the 24 hours of hell on Earth that followed
The months after the impact and the factors that drove dinosaurs to extinction
The information provided in this book has been gathered from paleontologists such as Dr. Jim Kirkland, Dr. Philip Currie, Dr. Thomas Holtz, Dr. Thomas Carr, and Dr. Penny Higgins and biologist Randall Ott as well as from multiple books and documentaries. This is currently our best theory as to what happened 65 million years ago.You will love this book if you are interested in dinosaurs and prehistory.Alpha is a realistic fiction book that speaks to people of all ages who are interested in learning more about prehistory and the catastrophic event that would allow mammals to take over as the dominant life forms and ultimately give rise to humans. The Book - Alpha The following is an excerpt from about halfway through the book, detailing the impact of the asteroid:For now, Alpha is not worried. Her brain, though intelligent for a dinosaur, is not capable of worrying about future events. She bumps snouts with Beta and then settles her head down to go to sleep.The light is blinding. It comes as suddenly as lightning during a thunderstorm. Followed soon after is another, even more blinding light to the south. The dinosaurs do not see the asteroid streak across the sky like all the disaster movies imply. One moment everything is fine, and then the next, everything is on fire.Every dinosaur in North and South America turns their head in the direction of the light. Carnivores stop hunting and herbivores look up from their meals. Everything falls silent as primal birds stop chirping and mammals and insects stop moving to brace for what’s coming. The world is about to end.The first light the dinosaurs saw was the asteroid entering the atmosphere of the Earth and the second is the impact itself. The blast will come later as sound travels at roughly 767 miles per hour and anything in the immediate vicinity that could hear the impact was dead instantly.The asteroid struck the Yucatan Peninsula in the Gulf of Mexico, where it gouged a hole 30,000 feet deep and caused the rock of the Earth's crust to behave like a liquid for a split second. The power is equivalent to that of 100 million hydrogen bombs and it is even visible from the moon. The asteroid was vaporized instantly, but the sound it made was deafening when it reached the ears of the dinosaursAll the water within a 100 mile radius of the impact is turned to steam and anything within a 250 mile radius is killed instantly. They could be considered the lucky ones.As near as Alpha can tell, there is fire in the sky. Where one second it had been clear, the next there is a trail left behind by the asteroid. She is frozen by fear as other raptors turn to her for direction on how to face this new threat.There is a monstrous roar, not of this world, as super-heated ash and rock race away from the impact zone just three seconds after the impact. Alpha and her pack have only seconds to act.Millions of years of predatory instinct engraved in her DNA and only one, the most primal, rings true in Alpha's head: Run. What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:
The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December 2019
The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!
The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)
The Copyediting for My Book - to make help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication
The Launch & Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this winter
When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish:
A Personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book
Your Name will appear in a Special, Acknowledgements Section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”)

<h3>1. The Deep Roots</h3>
<p><i>The Deep Roots</i> reminds you of the <i>happiness seeds</i> found deep in your life. Thinking of this as a daily gratitude practice but in a more general form. For example, I have a picture of my family and my father’s words as near the base of my deep roots. So, when a storm comes, just like a tree, these deep roots anchor us.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>2. The Fresh Circle</h3>
<p><i>The Fresh Circle</i> brings to mind fresh flowers. It is for resolving <i>your priorities by focusing on what you consider to be important now</i> as guiding principals in your life. Just like we experience and deal with our priority tasks in our daily journal, in the larger seasons of our lives, we can see clear patterns of priorities that may change with time. Through being aware, you are in touch with your life more deeply, and you benefit through insights about yourself that develop over time.  </p>

<h3>3. The Solid Year</h3>
<p><i>The Solid Year</i> is like the strong nourishing branches, helping you to form a holistic picture of your progress.The Solid Year is presented as a <i>12-month calendar</i> so that you can reflect on your monthly goals.

<h3>4. The Clear 24 Hours</h3>
<p>Hours are like glossy green leaves, handful but fragile. Every single leaf contributes its best to the larger tree. <i>The Clear 24 Hours</i> is<i> a plan of an ideal day, one that is guided by your feelings,</i> as if you have everything you want. It helps you to clarify the images and imagination of how a perfect and happy day looks like when you achieve all the goals you want. It motivates you to go forwards but also reminds you that by actively being present with every living day, you can immediately make those positive feelings happen right now. </p>

<h3>5. The Free Space</h3>
<p><i>The Free Space </i>is where air, sunlight, wind, butterflies, and all other living conditions interact with the tree. It is also where the tree gives back with its oxygen, beauty and fruit. It is the same in @EaseJournal, where you record <i>all lessons you have along the journey,</i> comprising such questions about life as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you believe?</li>
<li>What do you value?</li>

<h3>Differences between <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520336494/qsmhn6e5njkd2njm1vld.png"" src=""""/> EaseJournal and daily journals.</h3>
<p>Many daily journals start with a clear intention: “What do you want to do with your life?”, and then daily actions are based on that. And it is a perfectly suitable approach when you know what you want and commit to it.</p>

<p>However, this was not my case years ago. Every day passed by without feeling meaningful and contented. I have found another approach, where I can become aware of what I want to do with my life, in the long-term, yet remain mindfully aware and actively enjoy the ""here and now.""</p>
<p><i><strong>Neither is better. The most important thing is the one that suits you better.</strong></i></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>The truth is that I did not intentionally create it!</i></strong></p>
<p>It's started with my own story, in which an (almost) twenty-something girl felt unfulfilled and restless with life. A lot of options and opportunities materialised, but I did not know how to resolve ideas about what I want. So,<i><strong> I created a 5-year plan</strong></i> with the hope for better life navigation.</p>
<p>After 5 years, <i><strong>my plan didn't work out!</strong></i> I fell into a severe depressive stage, which confirmed to me that a lot of the criticism on long-term planning is true. I was depressed because I was unable to achieve my career and financial goals. Actually I was unable to form the images I needed to form. However, it was also <i><strong>the moment where I realised that I have learned so much about myself </strong></i>along the journey.</p>
<p>It was when I realised, step-by-step, that I learned to let go of the ideal image of ""having-it-all"", and to be more compassionate towards myself. Breaking down my goals for each month, I have learned most not when achieving them but <i><strong>w<strong>hen lookin</strong>g back at the whole picture of how my goals, and myself, have changed over time. </strong></i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521453248/oyldovfopb7ao0qrmskd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And the most important lesson was, <i><strong>“My life is much bigger than my thoughts.” </strong></i>Just being there, and kindly embrace all the expectations for myself, I have been able to accept who am I, and so now I treat myself more kindly. Slowly, I encouraged myself to follow the answer I have found for the question, “What do I truly and happily want to do with my life?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520950498/fwgeo9ppsbwetvdloow1.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Along the journey of self-understanding and self-loving, <i><strong>I have been so lucky and blessed to receive so much kindness, support, caring, and wisdom </strong></i>in the hardest and toughest moments of my life. So that is why I want to share back, to express my gratitude for what I have received.</p>
<p>Maybe it will help somebody, especially others young people who are exploring life and themselves, and suddenly feel lost.  </p>
<p>So, I have crafted all the lessons in @EaseJournal</p>

<p>I truly want to share to everyone, so here is the templates for the three most critical parts, which I have explained how to use above. You can print and keep them in one place and observe how you have changed over time.  </p>
<p>A small tip from me: <i>Do it with the people you love if it’s possible</i>. The ultimate goal we have in life is to be happy. And we’re happy and feel loved most when our loved ones can understand and accept us as who we are. Share it with your loved ones, so you both can understand each other’s wishes and dreams,</p>

<h3>Where are you now?</h3>
<p>At the moment, I have finished prototype printing for the final version. </p>
<p>Additionally, I am collaborating with a lecturer to integrate @EaseJournal into the content of a course with the aim of reducing self-conflict. </p>
<p> </p>

<div>
<p> </p>
<p>All the money is used for the first batch production and further development of @Ease to integrate into schools and education systems, as I believe self-compassion is one of the most important skills for young people to learn.</p>
<p>Even if I won't reach my entire goal, I still continue this path I have chosen. All the money will still be targeted to further develop @Ease Journal and the journaling system. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<p><strong>Why is the shipping cost so high?</strong></p>
<p>Because it’s from the Santa Claus. Well, it’s only joking but partly true. <i>I am based in Finland, which makes the transportation more expensive.</i> (Btw, Finland is <a href=""http://worldhappiness.report/news/2018/03/14/finland-wins-double-gold-in-2018-world-happiness-report/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the happiest country</a> in the world this year). So we are also sending Finnish nature and happy energy to wherever you are. :”)</p>
<p>Back to the point, I do not take anything from the shipping cost. <a href=""https://www.posti.fi/private/send/international-letters.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here</a> you can overview the shipping rate from the Finnish post office + 8% contributing to Indiegogo platform and fee charge. There is also the limited option of shipping (2kg and 5kg). Therefore, a package of three journals has the same shipping price as six journals (Each journal weight approximately 0.7kg). However, this journal is not designed on yearly basis, but rather to be used for 3-5 years. So, the total cost divides by three, I hope it feels more reasonable to you.</p> <p><strong>What?! So, I can use @EaseJournal up to lifetime of 3 to 5 daily journals?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, which actually means 3-5 years. Because <i>@EaseJournal focuses on the big picture.</i> Daily journals/ to-do lists concentrate on short-term planning and actions. @EaseJournal wants to help you have a long-term vision, but in a kind and calm way, with self-compassion, not pushing or forcing your way.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why is the journal so heavy (and more expensive than average journals too)?</strong></p>
<p>I understand in this fast and rapid world, things should be more convenient, compact and light. But I guess <i>the most important that should be light is our mind and soul.</i> Therefore, the journal was designed with hardcover, full A4 size, and 120gsm papers (1.5 thicker than the standard paper), with the aim helping you solidly and comfortably to stop and be still. As the consequence, the price is a bit higher.     </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How is the long-term vision with your approach different from other self-help, self-development books?</strong></p>
<p>Well, I don’t think I fully have the answer to the question. But based on my experiences and my mindfulness practice, I have learned the difference in self-development which increases self-esteem; and self-compassion. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ4jrd9IIh0&amp;t=2782s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A Dharma teacher </a>in the <a href=""https://plumvillage.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Plum Village tradition</a> has put it in this way “But <i>the problem with high self-esteem is you’re still comparing yourself to other people. </i>In fact, sometimes you’re competing with them and secretly hoping they do worse than you do. It’s not a very good way to live a spiritual life. With self-compassion, we’re learning how to bring not just empathy to ourselves but goodwill to ourselves, in a phenomenal way.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>When you said you practiced mindfulness training, what does that mean?</strong></p>
<p>It means I practice<i> mindful breathing and smiling to be in touch deeply with life</i>. :”) Practically, I have started the journey since 2013. I spent a couple times (2 weeks to 1 month) in the Plum Village Meditation Center retreats. <a href=""https://plumvillage.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Plum Village</a>, found by Vietnamese Zen Master Thich Nhat Nhat, is a meditation centre based in France. The centre focuses on mindfulness practices. Every year, I always try to spend a minimal amount of time in a retreat. I am now joining in a mindfulness practice group in Helsinki every week. It is an ongoing process. My negative or criticizing thoughts still ‘visit’ me here and there, but I am happy where I am now.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Are you sure it will work? I will love myself more by using your journal?</strong></p>
<p><i>No, I’m not sure.</i> I have been through the journey and I know how hard it is to love oneself properly. And self-love totally depends on personal commitment. Many people can have self-acceptance and self-compassion without @Ease. @Ease has helped me so I just want to share. <i>Maybe it can provide a simple journaling system that makes things more easily for you to start caring for yourself.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why don’t you offer a PDF perk?</strong></p>
<p>Because I do not think it’s worth it. If you go through the flip, you can see the key contents of @Ease. It’s pretty simple. And I have offered all the key templates and the instructions. You can definitely use the @Ease journaling system in your own way without difficulties. <i>I don’t think it’s fair </i>to charge for the same thing I have shared publicly.</p> <p><strong>Then, why should I buy @Ease Journal?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t really have the answer for this except because you want it and you think it might be helpful for you or your loved ones.</p> <p><strong>I can do all this same thing in my bullet journal? Why I need another journal?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, definitely you are welcome to execute all the ideas I suggest here. You don’t need @Ease. It’s just if you want and think it might be helpful and make your life better. But it’s just based on my experience that <i>when we separate short-term</i>, daily activities, and the passion to achieve goals, complete tasks (daily journal/ bullet journal) <i>with a long-term view</i>, a calm mind, a stop to rest (@Ease), <i>it reduces distraction, and helps our minds</i> to learn and understand better. It’s like the kitchen is for cooking and eating, and the bedroom is for sleeping. :) Talking about bullet journals, the size of <i>@Ease is A4, which gives you more space</i>. @Ease gathers all your thoughts and wishes about the big picture, and it might be easier to see clearly.</p> <p><strong>I am too lazy to have another journal?</strong></p>
<p>It’s not for carrying around l like your daily journal. It’s for a weekend at the end of every month, and you start to check “Ah, what I need to do next”. I<i>t encourages you to have time to listen to your self talks</i>, dreams, which is one of the fundamental way to increase self-compassion.</p> <p><strong>What do you mean by doing this journal with my loved ones? I mean isn't a journal very private thing?</strong></p>
<p>I totally understand that journaling is pretty private. I just mean if it’s possible. You don’t need to do it if you’re not comfortable. And self-compassion starts with ourselves first. <i>Please do what you feel is best and most comfortable for you.</i> After that, you might want to share it with your loved ones, so you both can understand each other’s wishes and dreams more.</p> <p><strong>Why on earth you created this journal?</strong></p>
<p><i>I didn’t intentionally do it</i>. I did it because I couldn’t find anything like it. And it has helped me, so I just think maybe it will help others too.</p> <p><strong>I can’t find the questions I want to ask!!!</strong></p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
</div>
</div><p>This is the first time I am running a large publication project. Although I am quite new and inexperienced, I am trying my best to ensure everything is under my control. I will oversee every step of the process, and hand check every single package before sending it out to your hands.   </p></div>","@EaseJournal is for you to

understand your journey more deeply;

love yourself more kindly;

embrace your life with a mindful vision and concrete actions. 
 @EaseJournal is printed journal on high quality, environmentally-friendly paper with a faux leather hardcover for years of durability.The journal serves as a perfect bi-monthly complement to your daily journal.  Daily journals help you accomplish tasks and gain productivity;  @Ease helps you to stop to rest and be still.  Daily journals help you take care of daily activities; @Ease shows you where you are in the journey; and brings you back to your holistic vision .   Daily journals help you move towards to your future goals; @Ease reminds you how the ""here and now"" can be fulfilling and enjoyable.  ​Supporting your daily journals, planners or to-do lists, @Ease helps you to mindfully observe your life and keep on track with the changes needed to achieve your long-term visions. And especially if you are navigating through a lot challenges and opportunities in life, discovering your life and yourself, @Ease is for you to embrace that wonderful journey, the journey of coming back to who you truly and beautifully are.  The uniqueness    @EaseJournal was crafted as a long-term visioning method with an open and mindful spirit. The journal is for you to be at ease with who you are, slow down to enjoy the present moment, and still take actions with a mindful and clear vision.Just like the Zen circle in the ‘at’ (@) of 'at ease', the journal wants to help you be still and calm in this rapidly changing digital world. Every @EaseJournal can be used up to the lifetime of 3 to 5 daily journals.    

 
The journal is crafted like a tree.
It has roots, flowers, branches, leaves and the surroundings.
 

 
1. The Deep Roots
The Deep Roots reminds you of the happiness seeds found deep in your life. Thinking of this as a daily gratitude practice but in a more general form. For example, I have a picture of my family and my father’s words as near the base of my deep roots. So, when a storm comes, just like a tree, these deep roots anchor us.

 
2. The Fresh Circle
The Fresh Circle brings to mind fresh flowers. It is for resolving your priorities by focusing on what you consider to be important now as guiding principals in your life. Just like we experience and deal with our priority tasks in our daily journal, in the larger seasons of our lives, we can see clear patterns of priorities that may change with time. Through being aware, you are in touch with your life more deeply, and you benefit through insights about yourself that develop over time.  

 
3. The Solid Year
The Solid Year is like the strong nourishing branches, helping you to form a holistic picture of your progress.The Solid Year is presented as a 12-month calendar so that you can reflect on your monthly goals. Every new month, you may create a new month's calendar in your daily planner/ bullet journal. @Ease Journal wants to help you keep everything in one place holistically, so you will also be able to see where you are in the journey.


 
4. The Clear 24 Hours
Hours are like glossy green leaves, handful but fragile. Every single leaf contributes its best to the larger tree. The Clear 24 Hours is a plan of an ideal day, one that is guided by your feelings, as if you have everything you want. It helps you to clarify the images and imagination of how a perfect and happy day looks like when you achieve all the goals you want. It motivates you to go forwards but also reminds you that by actively being present with every living day, you can immediately make those positive feelings happen right now. 


 
5. The Free Space
The Free Space is where air, sunlight, wind, butterflies, and all other living conditions interact with the tree. It is also where the tree gives back with its oxygen, beauty and fruit. It is the same in @EaseJournal, where you record all lessons you have along the journey, comprising such questions about life as:

What do you believe?
What do you value?
What brings you joy?
What is your life mission?

And also

Your ""bucket lists""
A random happy corner
Your 5-year template


 
 

Differences between  EaseJournal and daily journals.
Many daily journals start with a clear intention: “What do you want to do with your life?”, and then daily actions are based on that. And it is a perfectly suitable approach when you know what you want and commit to it.

However, this was not my case years ago. Every day passed by without feeling meaningful and contented. I have found another approach, where I can become aware of what I want to do with my life, in the long-term, yet remain mindfully aware and actively enjoy the ""here and now.""
Neither is better. The most important thing is the one that suits you better.



How does daily journal obscure the long-term vision? 

Daily journals focus on small details, and so it might hard to see the big picture; 
Certain changes only happen after a period of time.

 



 
It looks SIMPLE and STILL.
 
The modern and minimal design allows the maximum space for you to draw, doodle, or write anything you want to. It reflects the enormous space deep inside of you.

The faux leather hardcover is simple yet durable so the journal can stay with you years. 

Thick and environmentally-friendly papers for a pleasant writing experience.

Sewn-binding helps the journal open flat. And there also is a white bookmark ribbon.

Full A4 size.  Scale comparison with a Macbook Air 13' and an Iphone 6Plus

Not much thicker than an Iphone 6Plus.

 Scale comparison with a Macbook Air 13'


 
 



 
The truth is that I did not intentionally create it!
It's started with my own story, in which an (almost) twenty-something girl felt unfulfilled and restless with life. A lot of options and opportunities materialised, but I did not know how to resolve ideas about what I want. So, I created a 5-year plan with the hope for better life navigation.
After 5 years, my plan didn't work out! I fell into a severe depressive stage, which confirmed to me that a lot of the criticism on long-term planning is true. I was depressed because I was unable to achieve my career and financial goals. Actually I was unable to form the images I needed to form. However, it was also the moment where I realised that I have learned so much about myself along the journey.
It was when I realised, step-by-step, that I learned to let go of the ideal image of ""having-it-all"", and to be more compassionate towards myself. Breaking down my goals for each month, I have learned most not when achieving them but when looking back at the whole picture of how my goals, and myself, have changed over time. 

And the most important lesson was, “My life is much bigger than my thoughts.” Just being there, and kindly embrace all the expectations for myself, I have been able to accept who am I, and so now I treat myself more kindly. Slowly, I encouraged myself to follow the answer I have found for the question, “What do I truly and happily want to do with my life?” 
 

 
Along the journey of self-understanding and self-loving, I have been so lucky and blessed to receive so much kindness, support, caring, and wisdom in the hardest and toughest moments of my life. So that is why I want to share back, to express my gratitude for what I have received.
Maybe it will help somebody, especially others young people who are exploring life and themselves, and suddenly feel lost.  
So, I have crafted all the lessons in @EaseJournal
GO FOR A PREVIEW OF SOME PAGES HERE
I truly want to share to everyone, so here is the templates for the three most critical parts, which I have explained how to use above. You can print and keep them in one place and observe how you have changed over time.  
A small tip from me: Do it with the people you love if it’s possible. The ultimate goal we have in life is to be happy. And we’re happy and feel loved most when our loved ones can understand and accept us as who we are. Share it with your loved ones, so you both can understand each other’s wishes and dreams,

Where are you now?
At the moment, I have finished prototype printing for the final version. 
Additionally, I am collaborating with a lecturer to integrate @EaseJournal into the content of a course with the aim of reducing self-conflict. 
 


 
All the money is used for the first batch production and further development of @Ease to integrate into schools and education systems, as I believe self-compassion is one of the most important skills for young people to learn.
Even if I won't reach my entire goal, I still continue this path I have chosen. All the money will still be targeted to further develop @Ease Journal and the journaling system. 
-------------------------
You will receive your @EaseJournal by July, so you will have a cup of summer tea with the journal!

 


 
Why is the shipping cost so high?
Because it’s from the Santa Claus. Well, it’s only joking but partly true. I am based in Finland, which makes the transportation more expensive. (Btw, Finland is the happiest country in the world this year). So we are also sending Finnish nature and happy energy to wherever you are. :”)
Back to the point, I do not take anything from the shipping cost. Here you can overview the shipping rate from the Finnish post office + 8% contributing to Indiegogo platform and fee charge. There is also the limited option of shipping (2kg and 5kg). Therefore, a package of three journals has the same shipping price as six journals (Each journal weight approximately 0.7kg). However, this journal is not designed on yearly basis, but rather to be used for 3-5 years. So, the total cost divides by three, I hope it feels more reasonable to you. What?! So, I can use @EaseJournal up to lifetime of 3 to 5 daily journals?
Yes, which actually means 3-5 years. Because @EaseJournal focuses on the big picture. Daily journals/ to-do lists concentrate on short-term planning and actions. @EaseJournal wants to help you have a long-term vision, but in a kind and calm way, with self-compassion, not pushing or forcing your way.  
 
Why is the journal so heavy (and more expensive than average journals too)?
I understand in this fast and rapid world, things should be more convenient, compact and light. But I guess the most important that should be light is our mind and soul. Therefore, the journal was designed with hardcover, full A4 size, and 120gsm papers (1.5 thicker than the standard paper), with the aim helping you solidly and comfortably to stop and be still. As the consequence, the price is a bit higher.     
 
How is the long-term vision with your approach different from other self-help, self-development books?
Well, I don’t think I fully have the answer to the question. But based on my experiences and my mindfulness practice, I have learned the difference in self-development which increases self-esteem; and self-compassion. A Dharma teacher in the Plum Village tradition has put it in this way “But the problem with high self-esteem is you’re still comparing yourself to other people. In fact, sometimes you’re competing with them and secretly hoping they do worse than you do. It’s not a very good way to live a spiritual life. With self-compassion, we’re learning how to bring not just empathy to ourselves but goodwill to ourselves, in a phenomenal way.”
 
When you said you practiced mindfulness training, what does that mean?
It means I practice mindful breathing and smiling to be in touch deeply with life. :”) Practically, I have started the journey since 2013. I spent a couple times (2 weeks to 1 month) in the Plum Village Meditation Center retreats. Plum Village, found by Vietnamese Zen Master Thich Nhat Nhat, is a meditation centre based in France. The centre focuses on mindfulness practices. Every year, I always try to spend a minimal amount of time in a retreat. I am now joining in a mindfulness practice group in Helsinki every week. It is an ongoing process. My negative or criticizing thoughts still ‘visit’ me here and there, but I am happy where I am now.  
 
Are you sure it will work? I will love myself more by using your journal?
No, I’m not sure. I have been through the journey and I know how hard it is to love oneself properly. And self-love totally depends on personal commitment. Many people can have self-acceptance and self-compassion without @Ease. @Ease has helped me so I just want to share. Maybe it can provide a simple journaling system that makes things more easily for you to start caring for yourself.
 
Why don’t you offer a PDF perk?
Because I do not think it’s worth it. If you go through the flip, you can see the key contents of @Ease. It’s pretty simple. And I have offered all the key templates and the instructions. You can definitely use the @Ease journaling system in your own way without difficulties. I don’t think it’s fair to charge for the same thing I have shared publicly. Then, why should I buy @Ease Journal?
I don’t really have the answer for this except because you want it and you think it might be helpful for you or your loved ones. I can do all this same thing in my bullet journal? Why I need another journal?
Yes, definitely you are welcome to execute all the ideas I suggest here. You don’t need @Ease. It’s just if you want and think it might be helpful and make your life better. But it’s just based on my experience that when we separate short-term, daily activities, and the passion to achieve goals, complete tasks (daily journal/ bullet journal) with a long-term view, a calm mind, a stop to rest (@Ease), it reduces distraction, and helps our minds to learn and understand better. It’s like the kitchen is for cooking and eating, and the bedroom is for sleeping. :) Talking about bullet journals, the size of @Ease is A4, which gives you more space. @Ease gathers all your thoughts and wishes about the big picture, and it might be easier to see clearly. I am too lazy to have another journal?
It’s not for carrying around l like your daily journal. It’s for a weekend at the end of every month, and you start to check “Ah, what I need to do next”. It encourages you to have time to listen to your self talks, dreams, which is one of the fundamental way to increase self-compassion. What do you mean by doing this journal with my loved ones? I mean isn't a journal very private thing?
I totally understand that journaling is pretty private. I just mean if it’s possible. You don’t need to do it if you’re not comfortable. And self-compassion starts with ourselves first. Please do what you feel is best and most comfortable for you. After that, you might want to share it with your loved ones, so you both can understand each other’s wishes and dreams more. Why on earth you created this journal?
I didn’t intentionally do it. I did it because I couldn’t find anything like it. And it has helped me, so I just think maybe it will help others too. I can’t find the questions I want to ask!!!
Please don’t hesitate to contact me directly via email daukimngan@gmail.com.
 
 


 
The simplified version of the design journey (with pictures)
 

This is my own journal, so called the very first version of @Ease. I'm a bit of pinky type. :"")
 
 

This is my Deep Roots! <3 
 

This is my first attempt to navigate my life. Using common sense, creating a mind map!
 

After the mind map, I tried to use 'scenario imagination'!
 

And so, I had my first ""Fresh Circle"" in 20.11.2013!
 

I originally used the yearly calendar to map out all the plans and steps but it did not quite turn out that way.
 

My wireframe for the first concept.
 

This is the first prototype of the first concept. And credit goes to one of my good friends.
 

When I calmed myself, my first intention was to create a notebook and give all of my lessons to my brother. So that his new journey will be a bit easier on the go. 
 

The very first version of 'The Fresh Circle' to my dear brother! I didn't name it back then. I just simply put what I thought most important to him.
 

Then, my drawing and the first draft of @EaseJournal.
 

The first prototype of @Ease. We made a mistake with cover, so it was kind of... reverse. :D Mistakes are a part of every journey. 
 

This is how many versions it takes to get to this!

@EaseJournal to you!

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>My name is Kate Owens and I am the author of Rootless. I wrote this book because I am incredibly passionate about helping people make lifestyle changes, yet I understand the complex barriers that often stand in the way preventing achievement of long term success.<br/><br/>My hope is that from reading this book you will discover the need for new solutions to help someone increase physical activity and change diet-it is not a simple process. I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for living a healthy life and ensuring others receive the support to do so. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you tackle your own health behavior change journey!<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the four essential themes, ROOTS, I uncovered that are required for changing a consequential health behavior:</p>
<p>The power of <strong>Reflection</strong></p>
<p>The importance of taking steps<strong> One </strong>at a time</p>
<p>The strength of <strong>Others</strong></p>
<p>The necessity for <strong>Tailoring</strong> help to the individual</p>You will love this book if you are looking to make a lifestyle change, wanting to support a loved one on a health change journey, or curious about the future of our medical system. Rootless is a non-fiction book that speaks to health promoters and Americans alike who are looking for foundational support and lasting success for the first time.<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - Rootless</h2> The book is written in 6 Parts:<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + additional background chapters. This part lays the foundation for the rest of the book. It explores what the problem is and why it is necessary to be addressed. The reader will learn the story that sparked my inspiration to tackle a large problem our country faces today.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> Reflection contains Chapters 1-4. The reader will learn the art of reflection and how it can be a powerful tool in tackling challenging health behaviors such as losing weight or consistently incorporating physical activity into a daily routine. Rick Miner shares his story on how introspection, both within himself and of his past, helped him lose over 200 pounds.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> One Thing at a Time contains Chapters 5-8. Part 3 explores the theme of breaking tasks into manageable chunks so as to smoothly help with health behavior transitions. The research of Sean Young, PhD, a behavioral psychologist and medical school professor at UCLA, demonstrates this critical piece when changing health habits.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> Others contains Chapters 9-13. Part 4 teaches the incredible power of community support and why it is so beneficial for health behavior changes. It looks at already existing communities that support healthy lifestyles and what enables them to have success. The Cost of Loneliness project is a movement that seeks to combat loneliness and its resounding detrimental health effects.<br/><br/><strong>Part 5</strong> Tailoring contains Chapters 14-17. This section dictates the importance of acknowledging the individual. Whether it is as simple as determining specific preferences or as complex as recognizing large personal, familial, and societal influences, there are many factors that affect an individual's health status. Dr. White Perkins walks me through her incredibly important work in Detroit working to fight social determinants of health to allow for more tailored care.<br/><br/>Part 6 A Way Forward contains Chapters 18-20. The concluding section ties together the extensive research and lays out a path that may hold a potential solution. It examines the two different fields of workplace wellness and preventative care in which this approach may feasibly be implemented.<h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in July, 2019</li>
<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</li>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>Our Exclusive Society explores a diverse range of topics that fall under the category of inclusive design through stories that range from accessibility, sexism, and culturalization.<br/><br/>My name is Rachel Rodney and I am the author of Our Exclusive Society. I wrote this book because inclusive design is a really interesting space - first I was interested in accessible design, then universal design, then realized the broader issue in itself was the exclusion embedded in society. When I realized this space of inclusive design was still largely unexplored, I embarked on my own journey to see what else I could learn through talking to people involved in forming more inclusive experiences.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that many people are excluded by what others put out every day - and that with more thorough understanding and creativity, these people don’t have to be excluded. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for inclusive design in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you open your mind and consider who you aren’t considering now, whether it be in your designs or the way that you treat people in your workplace.<br/><br/>In this book, we'll explore culturalization and accessibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>The need to customize games by culture.</li>
<li>The imperative of personal independence through design.</li>
</ul>
<p>Makers and creators will love this book as a guide to start sharing your work with everyone!</p>
<p>My first non-fiction book, Our Exclusive Society, speaks to designers and creatives who look to inclusive design for help opening their work to a more diverse audience.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Book - Our Exclusive Society</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + additional chapters. This will include a background in inclusive design, such as what is going on in this space today. Another important part of this is defining what inclusive design is! <br/><br/>Part 2 goes in depth about some different populations that are impacted by exclusion, aligned with stories I heard about from primary interviews with people that have in some way been involved in inclusion.<br/><br/>Part 3 looks at more theoretical aspects of inclusion, such as the crossroads of inclusive design and empathy.<br/> </p>
<h3>What I Need, What You Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Rachel Rodney is a UX student who has researched the experience of people using 3D printed prosthetics, and studied abroad in South Africa learning about the experience people have with disability in resource limited communities. She has also been to many toy adaption events, adapting circuitry in electronic toys so that they can be attached to switches or buttons, making the interactions a child might have with the toy accessible. Rachel has also recently been studying in India, designing the idea for an application which would make job searching more inclusive to migrant workers and work to decrease their chances of being exploited. This included many interviews with migrant workers and local employers, to design for the needs that set migrant workers apart from locals.<br/><br/>At first Rachel was interested in accessibility, after realizing how accessibility may have impacted her mom’s life, and also getting involved in a club where she did research about topics in accessibility. However, her experience studying abroad in South Africa, where she learned about compounded disparities and how that applied to disability in communities with limited resources, really made her more aware of how there are so many different factors in people lives that lead to exclusive experiences in our societies. Rachel’s interest in this space of inclusion and passion and belief that design can change the world has led her to write this book about inclusive design.<br/><br/>Outside of this book, Rachel is a Human Centered Design and Engineering student at the University of Washington. She loves learning about the research that fuels designs, and working in coffee shops. <br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Rachel at rachhanrodney@gmail.com and LinkedIn (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelrodney/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelrodney/</a>).</p>

Our Exclusive Society explores a diverse range of topics that fall under the category of inclusive design through stories that range from accessibility, sexism, and culturalization.My name is Rachel Rodney and I am the author of Our Exclusive Society. I wrote this book because inclusive design is a really interesting space - first I was interested in accessible design, then universal design, then realized the broader issue in itself was the exclusion embedded in society. When I realized this space of inclusive design was still largely unexplored, I embarked on my own journey to see what else I could learn through talking to people involved in forming more inclusive experiences.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that many people are excluded by what others put out every day - and that with more thorough understanding and creativity, these people don’t have to be excluded. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for inclusive design in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you open your mind and consider who you aren’t considering now, whether it be in your designs or the way that you treat people in your workplace.In this book, we'll explore culturalization and accessibility:

The need to customize games by culture.
The imperative of personal independence through design.

Makers and creators will love this book as a guide to start sharing your work with everyone!
My first non-fiction book, Our Exclusive Society, speaks to designers and creatives who look to inclusive design for help opening their work to a more diverse audience.
 

The Book - Our Exclusive Society
The book is written in 3 Parts....Part 1 contains the introduction + additional chapters. This will include a background in inclusive design, such as what is going on in this space today. Another important part of this is defining what inclusive design is! Part 2 goes in depth about some different populations that are impacted by exclusion, aligned with stories I heard about from primary interviews with people that have in some way been involved in inclusion.Part 3 looks at more theoretical aspects of inclusion, such as the crossroads of inclusive design and empathy. 
What I Need, What You Get
This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:

The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in July 2020.
The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!
The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)
The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication
The Launch & Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this Summer!
When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies, I will publish a hardcover edition. So back me up! I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:
You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish
A Personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book
Your Name will appear in a Special, Acknowledgements Section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”)
Early access to the Introduction of my Book and my entire manuscript, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback
The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my cover
I will do a book topic/workshop seminar where I will share experience the experiences of writing my book

<p>Rethinking Justice: Inside America’s Movement for Prosecution Reform<br/><br/><br/>My name is Vincenzo Guido and I am the author of Rethinking Justice: Inside America’s Movement for Prosecution Reform. Leading the world in the number of known incarcerated persons — well over two million people — it’s no wonder the U.S. stands at the epicenter of impassioned political debate. Prosecution reform observers have validly decried our current approach to criminal justice as perilously broken and in dire need of reform.<br/><br/>While the hydra that is reform has many heads, my book focuses on one area that often goes overlooked in serious conversations of reform: the prosecutor. From beginning to end, the prosecutor wields considerable power and influence in the enforcement of our laws and how we as a society respond.<br/><br/><br/>Historically, run-of-the-mill district attorneys (oftentimes regardless of political stripe) have virulently pursued a zealous, tough-on-crime approach to prosecution. Today, in major cities across the country, a newly minted generation of prosecutors is redefining the role of the district attorney. Will this shift effect meaningful criminal justice reform? Is this ostensible political paradox — loosely dubbed “progressive prosecution” — even possible?<br/><br/><br/>In this book, we’ll explore the current state of American prosecution and its connection to mass incarceration. We will consider how prosecution occupies an uniquely important and powerful role in protecting their local communities. However, we will also examine how those who come into contact with the criminal justice system often have the trajectory of their lives forever impacted. Most importantly, we will take a look at some of the brand new prosecutors who are among those leading the charge to change the way we handle crime in America. These civil servants seek to go beyond filling our jails and prisons and instead seek a different approach to justice.<br/><br/><br/>Full disclosure: I am a soon-to-be recent college graduate. I am not a criminal justice expert, prosecutor, nor attorney. To this point, I have no experiences as an incarcerated individual, nor as an officer of the state tasked with maintaining safety in our communities. I am, however, a citizen who calls upon fellow students, voters, and community members to intensively study the issues affecting our criminal justice system that have had immeasurably damaging effects for virtually all stakeholders. I do not aim to decisively solve these challenges with this book; instead, it is my hope that you will join me in considering the problems that face our current state of prosecution in America and work to contribute to dialogue and debate regarding how to remedy those challenges.<br/><br/> </p>
<p>A Road Map of the Book</p>
<p><br/><br/>Rethinking Justice is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/><br/>Part [1] dives right into the current state of the American criminal justice system. We consider how prosecution and our historical approach to addressing crime fits into our broader narrative of law enforcement in the United States.<br/><br/><br/>Part [2] introduces you to some of the newly minted generation of prosecutors — dubbed “progressive prosecutors” — and the work they are doing to try and upend antiquated approaches to criminal prosecution. We will look at a few key figures — committed civil servants leading the way for reform — and how they are attempting (or failing, or succeeding, or considering) to facilitate change in their local communities.<br/><br/><br/>Part [3] takes us to the present moment. Are these progressive prosecution tactics working? Is reform in prosecution just getting started or are these movements outliers? Ultimately, time will tell, and what we explore will prove to be critical areas of focus for future study.<br/> </p>

Filóloga de inglés y estudiante en ruso e italiano, esta es mi primera novela como tal, escrita en mi lengua paterna.</p>

Sí, hasta el momento en que me presentaron a aquella niña; aquella niña de pelo negro, largo y descuidado, vestida de un rostro amorfo, que se me acercó, inesperadamente, a darme el más inocente y mortal de los abrazos. Estaba fría. No recuerdo haber oído salir nada de su boca, pero creo que agradeció recibir aquel abrazo que ella misma había ofrecido.<br/>          Irreconocibles voces poblaban el ambiente… me dijeron que esa niña era mi hermana; hermanastra, siendo más precisa. Cómo pudo mi madre haber callado cosa igual, tal detalle de su vida, esa otra vida, tanto tiempo, y contármelo con tanta naturalidad, como si debiera saberlo antes incluso de serme anunciado.<br/>          Me dijeron que aquella niña necesitaba de mi calor. Aquel abrazo quizás fuese el primer paso de su vida. No me cuesta creerlo… creo que sonrió. Pero sonrió con el alma, con el corazón, porque su cara permaneció neutra. Creo que le vi la cara.<br/>          Para mi gran sorpresa, un último detalle me revelaron acerca de aquella niña. “Y no sabes los sueños que tiene”, me decían. Vi palidecer el rostro de mi interlocutor. Creo que no se trataba exactamente de sueños. “No sabes lo que sueña esa niña”. Me asusté. ¡Me asustaron! ¡Demonios! ¡Qué era eso! ¡Quién es esa niña! ¡Qué le ha pasado a mi hermana! ¿Mi hermana? ¡Está muerta!»</p>
<h3>¿Cómo?</h3>
<p>Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 880€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.</li>
<li>Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.</li>
<li>Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.</li>
</ul>
<p>Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de <i>Negro</i> que saldría después a la venta.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><u>Aviso para navegantes</u>: La opción RESPALDAR es únicamente para realizar donaciones a la edición, por lo que no habrá comunicaciones posteriores en busca de datos de envío... cualquiera de las opciones válidas de reserva exige cumplimentar formulario para poder servir el pedido.</i></p>
<h3>Además...</h3>
<p>Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona a la autora, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y <strong>Noemí Mendarozqueta</strong> vea publicada su obra.</p>

Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 880€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.

Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.
Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.
Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.

Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de Negro que saldría después a la venta.
Aviso para navegantes: La opción RESPALDAR es únicamente para realizar donaciones a la edición, por lo que no habrá comunicaciones posteriores en busca de datos de envío... cualquiera de las opciones válidas de reserva exige cumplimentar formulario para poder servir el pedido.
Además...
Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona a la autora, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y Noemí Mendarozqueta vea publicada su obra.
Gracias por vuestro tiempo.

Project aims

I need to reach pre-orders of 50 books and 15 models in order to create the book
The 38 page book will be suitable for all ages, particularly appropriate as a 'level one reader' children's book for ages 5-8, but can be read to younger children and enjoyed by adults.
It will be around 500 words long and told in verse.
The story will feature photos of real models and props, with added illustrative elements.
The book will also have an interactive 'activity' section, where readers will be encouraged to get creative. 

 
Story and characters

Bits is a 'whibbit', a little dog made from an old shoe, pencils, lolly sticks, bike chain and other everyday objects.  She lives on a desktop, helping her creator with his jobs - fetching things and cheering him up. They are best friends, and Bits loves her job, but her owner can't help thinking it'd be nice if she had more friends and more fun.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>The Third Culture Teen: In Between Cultures, In Between Life Stages</i> is a memoir/non-fiction book featuring stories from the author and various Third Culture Kids of different backgrounds getting by in this world as an expat.<br/><br/>My name is Jiwon Lee, and I am the author of The Third Culture Teen: In Between Cultures, In Between Life Stages. I wrote this book because I wanted to give a name to all the teenage Third Culture Kids out there who felt misunderstood and uncategorized.<br/><br/>My whole life I have struggled, and still struggle, with the question of my identity. Having spent more than half of my lifetime outside of Korea, where I was born, I never had the confidence to call myself a true Korean — or really a true anything. I was a mish-mash of all the cultures that lived within me, and I’ve been insecure about my unfinished, incomplete self for a long time.<br/><br/>The term Third Culture Kid gives a name to what I am and the community of people like me around the world who share the same experience. I wanted other confused teens like myself to know that they belong somewhere.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what being a “Third Culture Teen” entails, of all the struggles and excitement of growing up stuck between cultures and stuck between being a kid and an adult all at the same time! In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the Third Culture Kid community in you. And then, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help teenage Third Culture Kids and Cross-Cultural Kids (immigrant kids/international adoptees/biracial kids, etc) adjust into adulthood, and for non-TCKs, or CCKs, to understand the life of those who grew up between cultures.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll hear stories about the lives of various Third Culture Teen and the ways in which they have overcome their difficulties and used them for their advantage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different TCKs’ takes on the word “home” and the various categories in which their definitions of “home” fall into</li>
<li>Discussions of Third Culture Teen specific issues such as the role of technology or adjustments to college</li>
<li>Life stories and advice from adult TCKs in various sectors of society, ranging from Grace Lee, an international school teacher, to Lindie Botes, a polyglot YouTuber</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Book - <i>The Third Culture Teen: In Between Cultures, In Between Life Stages</i>
</h2>
<p>The book is written in 5 Parts.<br/><br/>Part 0 contains the introduction to the book, in addition to the introduction of the concept of the Third Culture Kid and, more importantly, the Third Culture Teen.<br/><br/>Part 1: The Issues We Face contains Chapters 3-4. I first talk about the concept of home, and the various ways Third Culture Teens might define home. I also discuss the issue of technology and how it can both be helpful yet detrimental to the formation of our identity. I have also included a mini-chapter of my interview with Grace Lee, an adult TCK English teacher in China.<br/><br/>Part 2: The Lives We Live contains Chapters 5-8. I discuss the different struggles Third Culture Teens face in their daily lives, including learning to “adult” in a foreign country, or dealing with differences while interacting with monocultural teens. I have also dedicated a chapter to ways in which we can maximize our advantages as Third Culture Kids.<br/><br/>Part 3: The Life We Will Live contains Chapters 9 and 10. Chapter 9 includes stories from Adult TCKs who have already overcome the struggles of being a “Third Culture Teen,” providing an insight into the lives Third Culture Teens will be facing as an adult. Chapter 10 is dedicated to the importance of sharing our stories as a Third Culture Kid. Because the term TCK is not as widely known yet, it is our responsibility to normalize the term and in turn, normalize our lives in society.<br/><br/>Part 4 is the concluding chapter of the book, including additional resources Third Culture Teens can refer to, and a Conclusion/Epilogue from the author.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I researched and wrote the first draft of my novel in Thailand at the beginning of 2012, and I now need your help so that I can return to finish it.</p>
<p>With just a little bit of your funding I can realise my dream and make it happen, finish my book and get it out there. Even $10 will make a massive difference between achieving my goal, or having to delay the process indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
<p>A girl gives up her misguided corporate world in Blighty to write a book in Thailand. On her arrival on a small, knackers-yard of an island she blocks. Then she flows. Into a world where only interbred animals exist, worshipping the pizza-making King and the only pure-breed on the island, a ginger ridgeback hound named Spiney.</p>
<p>Only life is what happens to her when she’s making other books, and the real events and escapades of her time spiral into a mystical whiskey-fuelled adventure of real love, betrayal, Thai boxing, chicken-men and other animals. And onto the page.</p>
<p>Think Cannery Row with a dose of Vonnegut, Spark and Gibran, and you’re not even half-way there. Action, disaster, misdemeanour, humility and survival with a hefty whiff of humour and a tantalising dash of raunch. Not for the faint-hearted, completely for the full. And totally real.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What I need is just a little bit of cash to get me out to Thailand and stop me from going under. I have, of course, been working and raising funds myself, but they’re not sufficient enough to fly me to the moon, nor keep me in noodle soup.</p>
<p>I am asking for $3200 which would mean I could rent a bungalow at reduced monthly rates, and have enough for a humble existence, whilst concentrating on finishing my book. Costs of living aren’t that high, and I fully intend to use the money discreetly and wisely.</p>
<p>Your small contribution can make a massive difference to my happiness, and of course, in return I will reward you with perks.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When I’ve finished the novel I intend to go down the traditional publishing route. I have meetings set up with agents before I intend to depart (beginning of December), and anticipate a lot of interest.</p>
<p>For those of you who aren’t familiar with my style, examples of my writing can be found on my website and various blog sites, just contact me if you want to know more here.</p>
<p>When I’m out in the jungle I will fill your days with joy and let you know how happy you have made me. This project is something I feel I absolutely need to do at this present moment. You really will be helping to contribute to a fulfilling life path for me, and getting my first novel published.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are screwed for cash, you can still help me by spreading the word about my project to more lubricated benefactors! Share on social networks, use the share tools on this site, and let your friends and family know what a worthwhile project this is. It will be so exciting to watch the campaign be a success and reach my target.</p>

In an attempt to inject more spice into their relationship, her husband, Tom Hamlin, suggests going to a sex club, which he later regrets after they meet Eric Firth, the owner of a British publishing company. Unlike Tom’s down-to-earth character, Eric is suave and lives a rich lifestyle, and what he wants, he usually gets. He sets his sights on Kelly and uses his publishing business to draw her in. By the end of the book, you will find out whether Eric’s manipulations bring Tom and Kelly closer together or tear them apart.</p><p>The story is mostly set in the present, although at certain points it goes back in time to show how Kelly and Tom met and fell in love. It is set in Auckland, New Zealand.<br/><br/>If this book gains success there will be an OVERWHELMED 2.<br/><br/><i>Genres: </i>Romance, realism, erotica, drama.<br/><i>Topics:</i> Marriage, love-triangles, relationships, family drama.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>I became interested in writing from a young age and have published my teenage diaries under the title <i>Don't Peek</i>. In my twenties I went to Auckland University, where I concentrated on non-fiction, mainly in the fields of Art History and Italian Studies. In my thirties I veered towards writing fiction, in particular young adult fantasy, which I later dropped for realism, such as seen in my <i>Behind the Lives</i> series and an edgy young adult spin-off called <i>Graffiti Heaven</i>. In addition, I have written a book serial called <i>My Masters’ Nightmare</i>. However, since none of the above projects were mainstream enough to make a living from, I set out to write a story that would gather more public attention. Part way through writing the draft for <i>Overwhelmed,</i> I realized I had finally found the story that could achieve this. Not only did it flow faster than all my other books, the story captivated me, which is hard to do as I’m very critical of my own writing. In saying this, I think it will also captivate other women. Novels like <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> and other erotica books are popular for the fantasy they build for women, but they don't focus on the reality of everyday life. Whereas, <i>Overwhelmed</i> has the same female fantasy of being chased by a wealthy man, but is placed in a realistic situation, where the woman has other more important priorities, such as her husband and children. This creates more of a dilemma for the main character, and makes the reader think: ""Would I really choose this 'seemingly' idealistic man over my husband?"" You will see by the end of the book who Kelly chooses.</p><p>In addition to writing, I’m also an artist, although I have put that career on hold in my endeavor on becoming a full-time writer. Because of this, I have decided to give some of my paintings away to people who have donated more than the usual amount. One of the paintings <i>“To the Point”</i> won an art award, while <i>""Tahuna Torea"" </i>was picked to be in an exclusive exhibition. Some of my other artworks have won a number of awards, the most prestigious being for a painting of two military officers talking to Afghanistan refugees. In addition, another of my award winning paintings was bought by a previous mayor of Auckland while my largest work which took several months to complete was unveiled by the current prime minister of New Zealand, John Key. If the artworks I have made available go quick, I am open to giving more of my paintings away.</p><h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3><p>My daughter came across Indiegogo, and mentioned it to me since she knew I was having trouble funding my writing. I had a look and was instantly captivated. I have financed all of my previous books, which was far too financially draining on my family. There are many expenses involved in self-publishing a book, such as hiring an editor (a significant cost), paying for the <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">cover design, proofs, review giveaways, advertising, etc. Advertising in particular can be a huge expense and is often why many self-published authors wallow in anonymity, mainly due to not having the budget of a traditional publisher. This is another reason why Indiegogo is very important. Through the funding attained from the Indiegogo campaign I will be able to get more people to notice my book. And I do want<i> Overwhelmed</i> to be noticed, because I am very confident it will have a good readership as I have researched the genre to make sure I wasn't jumping head first without knowing the book's audience.</span></p><p>Also, in going on Indiegogo, this project will be noticed by more people. In essence, it’s an advertisement in itself, a platform where I can talk about the project and get people excited about it.</p><p>Halfway through the campaign, I will put up another video to show you different aspects about myself and <i>Overwhelmed</i>. People can also ask me questions via the comment section.</p><p>I want to assure you that I take my writing very serious and I'm determined be a success in it, so I can help support my family as well as write stories that people enjoy.</p><p></p><h3><br/></h3><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/374734/files/20140216230709-pieChart_jpg__3_.jpg?1392620829"" src="""" style=""width: 568px; height: 363px;""/></p><h3>Stretch Goals</h3><p></p><p>While I have set the goal at $5000, as it will cover all basic expenses for me to be able to complete <i>Overwhelmed</i>, there are various others costs to further the novel.</p>

There should be. I’ve started writing one, with the working title <i>Tomorrow’s Songs Today</i>. It will cover the history of filk from the early SF conventions to today. If this campaign is successful, it will be available as a <b>free</b> e-book. It will be available by the end of 2014.<br/></p>
<p>Helping me out will be the same team that supported me on my previous crowdfunded e-book, <i>Files that Last</i>. Terri Wells has agreed in principle to do copy editing, and Matt Leger to provide cover art. </p>
<p>I've been around filk since 1989.

</div></div>","Short Summary There’s no book-length treatment of the history of filk, the folk music of science fiction fandom. There should be. I’ve started writing one, with the working title Tomorrow’s Songs Today. It will cover the history of filk from the early SF conventions to today. If this campaign is successful, it will be available as a free e-book. It will be available by the end of 2014.
Helping me out will be the same team that supported me on my previous crowdfunded e-book, Files that Last. Terri Wells has agreed in principle to do copy editing, and Matt Leger to provide cover art. 
I've been around filk since 1989. In that time, I've chaired two ConCertino filk conventions and am currently chairing a third, run filk programming for Boskone for about two decades, and been indicted inducted into the Filk Hall of Fame in 2004. I've been an officer of MASSFILC continuously since 1991. A number of filk songbooks have been edited by me, including some for Worldcons.
Filk goes back long before my involvement in it, and I'll be spending lots of time talking with people who can fill in the earlier history, people whose names are legendary in filk.
This is a book which I'd love to see, and the best way I know to see it is to make it happen, with the support of filk and SF fandom.   What We Need & What You Get You might ask why an e-book needs money. Isn't it just a matter of writing it and putting it up on the Web? Well, not if we want it to be good.
A book needs copy editing. Even the best writers need another pair of eyeballs to keep their blunders from getting into print. This is where Terri comes in, and it's time-consuming work, less fun than actually writing the book. She saved me from a lot of embarrassment in Files that Last.
Even a free book ought to look good, with a professional-looking cover. That's what I've asked Matt to provide. He does really good work.
The book will be available for free. There will probably be a payment-optional outlet for those who want to contribute, and there will be a limited hard-copy run, but essentially all the money I'll make from the book will be the income from this campaign. 
What if the campaign falls short? There will still be something. A shorter book without cover art. 
But let's not think of running short, let's think of stretch goals! If we can hit $3500, I'll bump Terri's role from copy editing to ongoing editorial review, working with me not just on whether I'm writing coherent sentences but on what I'm writing, telling me to do it over if it isn't good enough.
New stretch goals! As long as the campaign reaches its basic goal, I'll donate one signed and numbered print copy to Interfilk.

  The Impact 
In a way, this book is like Files that Last. It's an effort to make knowledge permanent. A free e-book can be passed on from computer to computer without wearing out or becoming inaccessible. You'll be able to give it to your grandchildren and let them know what crazy stuff you did at filk cons and where it came from. And you'll learn more about filk than you know now. At least I will, by the time I'm done! I've already put together what I think is the biggest list of past filk conventions ever compiled, and of course that will be in the book. (Did you know that the first filk con was called FilkCon? Eminently logical.)
I delivered Files that Last on time and expect to do the same with this.

  Risks & Challenges Any personal project carries some risk. There could be changes in my life that would make me fall behind schedule or even make the book impossible. If I find myself with other work that sucks up all my time and energy, the book will take longer. As long as I'm physically and mentally able to, I will produce the book, and there's no reason to believe I won't. 
I'm the only person making that promise. I've got full confidence in my team members, but they could also run into issues forcing them to change their plans. If they do, I'll find the best help I can elsewhere.

Remember when...Elizabeth’s personality changed after she was in the motorcycle accident....when Jessica blacklisted Robin Wilson from joining the Pi Beta Alphas because she was overweight...and when Bruce untied Jessica’s bathing suit top in the pool?If you were a child/young teen and avid reader in the eighties and nineties, you have the images of the beautiful, blond, blue-eyed, perfect sized-6 Wakefield twins of the Sweet Valley High book series burned into your memory.

I am embarking on a book to serve as a companion to the Sweet Valley High books. Through humor, creative writing, and nostalgia, I will be writing a companion book to the beloved series. 

In 2007, I launched the blog The Dairi Burger on a whim. As a pre-teen I devoured the entire Sweet Valley High series. Even as a child, I found them overwrought and campy.  In the blog, I chronicled my thoughts and reactions. as I reread them as an adult. Sure, they were badly written. But reading them in my adult feminist critical lens, I saw themes and messages in the books that made me think about its impact on my psyche and that of young girls.Others saw it too. The blog, thanks to promotion from other sites and word of mouth, amassed about 10,000 hits per week. Through the comments and communication with my readers, I built a community of smart, well-read women (and yes, some men) who were all connected by their shared love for the books and the shared laughter of how bad they were.In 2009, I had completed recapping the original 100 books in the series. I felt like it was a natural time to end, and I had said all I needed to with the blog. Last year, the long-awaited new Sweet Valley High book, Sweet Valley Confidential, was released. Diablo Cody, screenwriter of the hip, announced she was working on a draft of a Sweet Valley High script. The power of Sweet Valley High, whether we like it or not, still captivates us. Even in the two years since I officially stopped updating the blog, I have still kept in communication with those I have formed relationships with through my shared love of Sweet Valley High. 





I can read all your recaps on the blog. Why are you publishing a book?I hope to attract many readers who have not read my blog. There is a lot of material on the blog, and reading it in book form may be more enjoyable. Plus, I plan to add additional, new material including:*New, never before published recaps of the last 30 books in the series*A Sweet Valley High glossary, covering all the places, people, and ridiculous plotlines and themes*New essays reflecting on the series.



What I Need & What You Get


Since I plan on self-publishing, aside from actually writing this thing, I'll likely hire an editor and someone to help me format everything. I also plan to do some traveling to promote the book.

<h3>Setting A Precedent</h3>
<p>A teacher, a motivator and an enthusiast for peace. These are just a few of the words attributable to the makings of Starmel Allah. He uses knowledge of self which he has had for over 18years to bring to fruition the altruistic words and teachings that he has inherently garnered through the prophetic words of Allah’s Five Percent Nation.  A catalyst for change, he lives his life for the good of spreading the need for greater responsibility and accountability throughout the lives of himself and others.</p>
<p>In his debut release “The Righteous Way” Starmel hopes to bring to light that The Five Percent Nation is not just an old methodical organization standing in the shadows of history, but that it is a permanent component of historical teachings that still flourishes today with the premise of saving youth from regression, ignorance, violence, self-destruction and powerlessness. He shares his commitment to documenting the meaningful aspects of a teaching that can be traced back to some of the earliest known civilizations of mankind. A commitment that he personally has fought for the right to embrace and practice as a culture not only at the state court level, but at the federal government level of court as well.</p>
<p>With the words penned in “The Righteous Way”, Starmel hopes to materialize a light to the dimmed premise of need for change, the position for accepting only whole truths that are  supported by scientific backing as well as, keeping people informed and connected on what the current state of the community possesses.

<h3> </h3>
</div></div>","Setting A Precedent
A teacher, a motivator and an enthusiast for peace. These are just a few of the words attributable to the makings of Starmel Allah. He uses knowledge of self which he has had for over 18years to bring to fruition the altruistic words and teachings that he has inherently garnered through the prophetic words of Allah’s Five Percent Nation.  A catalyst for change, he lives his life for the good of spreading the need for greater responsibility and accountability throughout the lives of himself and others.
In his debut release “The Righteous Way” Starmel hopes to bring to light that The Five Percent Nation is not just an old methodical organization standing in the shadows of history, but that it is a permanent component of historical teachings that still flourishes today with the premise of saving youth from regression, ignorance, violence, self-destruction and powerlessness. He shares his commitment to documenting the meaningful aspects of a teaching that can be traced back to some of the earliest known civilizations of mankind. A commitment that he personally has fought for the right to embrace and practice as a culture not only at the state court level, but at the federal government level of court as well.
With the words penned in “The Righteous Way”, Starmel hopes to materialize a light to the dimmed premise of need for change, the position for accepting only whole truths that are  supported by scientific backing as well as, keeping people informed and connected on what the current state of the community possesses. The goal of his works are simple, to produce knowledge of self, achieve universal consciousness, community empowerment and peace!

<p> </p>
<p><strong>I met Mr Balasamy and the children who reside in the Hosanna children's home in Poonjeri Village, Tamil Nadu last year. The Children under Mr Balasmay's and care are aged between five and ten and are all rescued street kids from Chennai and Vellore they all have terrifying stories to tell, One of the smaller children was saved from the street after her drunk father poisoned her mother and imprisoned  she taken to the Hosanna Home 3 months ago and is the happiest child I have ever seen. </strong></p>
<p><strong> I had expected to see a dirty slum and scruffy urchins and ragamuffins, but to my delight we were greeted by 19 beautiful face in bright white pressed clothes and the smaller girls in shiny sarees.

<p><strong>The small school in the village has a teacher his staff consist of a cook a helper and cleaner. the kids keep their belongings in tin chests and sleep on worn out mats, they get three meals a day and live to a rigid regime of school, study, play and prayer these happy kids are in great hands.</strong></p>

There has been a massive amount of work that has gone in to it, and WE ARE SO CLOSE! We just need YOUR HELP. We have big dreams for this story. The truth is that we want this book eventually to be released worldwide in many different countries and languages. Right now we just need to get these illustrations <a class=""FAtxtL"" href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/froginthetree/a-childrens-book-written-and-illustrated-with-no-c"" id=""FALINK_2_0_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">complete</a> and to have it <a class=""FAtxtL"" href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/froginthetree/a-childrens-book-written-and-illustrated-with-no-c"" id=""FALINK_3_0_2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">self published</a>. </p>
<p>I am honored to work alongside the world renowned artist J.E. Larson. We have put a lot of time, energy, and <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/froginthetree/a-childrens-book-written-and-illustrated-with-no-c"" id=""_GPLITA_2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Text-Enhance"">money</a> into creating this story and making these characters come to life. </p>
<p><strong>With your help this book will be FULLY illustrated with extreme attention to detail and lively images that children of all ages will enjoy. </strong></p>
<p>This book will include 30 full color illustrations done without the use of any computers. The cover, binding, and the back of the book will also be created by J.E. Larson. </p>

<h1>ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PAGE YOU WILL FIND SOME STUFF WE WANT TO GIVE BACK TO YOU!</h1>
<p><strong>This book will become a reality because of YOU.</strong> We are so thankful for all your help and support and it's only fair that we give back to you as you are the ones that will make this a dream come true. We want to be very generous with you all and want you to be a part of this books future Because <strong>you are it's future! </strong></p>

<p><strong>Anything you can give will get us that much closer to getting this into the hands of kids all over the world.</strong></p>
<h1><strong>HOW DO I GET A COPY OF THE PRINTED BOOK? </strong></h1>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h1>A PLEDGE OF $25 OR MORE GETS YOU  A PHYSICAL COPY OF THE BOOK!</h1>
<p><strong>EVERYONE that pledges $25 or more will get a professionally printed PHYSICAL COPY of THE FROG IN THE TREE BOOK.</strong></p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 10px;"">TO BE DELIVERED AFTER CAMPAIGN FUNDING IS COMPLETE ""Times may vary depending on the time of print press production"" however, we will get it to as fast as we possibly can!</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is a LIMITED edition Copy. (NOTE: It will not include the full illustrations because we cannot pay the illustrator to draw them until our funding goal is met.

<h1>WHY DIDN'T YOU USE COMPUTER ILLUSTRATIONS?</h1>
<p>That is a good question. Now, we have nothing against computer created art at all, there are tons of books out there that look fantastic in this form, however, we wanted to create a children's book done in the old world style, using the same techniques that our favorite illustrators used dating all the way back to the 15th century. </p>
<p>It takes a MASSIVE amount of time and hard work to create these illustrations when working with physical tools, and if you screw up an illustration while creating it, there is no erase tool, so, you throw it away and start again. It takes countless hours of tedious work to create each one of these hand drawn illustrations, and we think it pays off in the finished product. </p>
<p>I grew up on an old farm in upper Michigan, we didnt have computers, cell <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/froginthetree/a-childrens-book-written-and-illustrated-with-no-c"" id=""_GPLITA_0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Text-Enhance"">phones</a>, or video games. I spent my childhood reading the old classical children's stories  that were done in real pen and ink, wood cuts, hand coloring, and meticulously created. </p>

<h1>WHAT THE STORY IS ABOUT</h1>
<p>Obviously the title will give you some insight as to what the story is about, however, there is a lot more to it then just a frog who lives in a tree. </p>
<p>I will keep it brief as I do not want to give the story away just yet.  It is written like a poem, a fable you could say. It is a story about a frog who runs away from home as he is teased for being very different than everyone else. He feels lonely, sad, and an outcast and so he shelters himself atop the branches of an old magical oak tree. But something happens to the frog while he is hiding up so high away from the world. </p>
<p>With the help of a small crow that had fallen from her nest the two embark on a wild, adventurous, and magical journey. </p>
<p><strong>This story was written to help children understand that it is ok to be yourself. We all look different, feel different, have different ideas, and it's ok to accept the differences of ourselves and of others. </strong></p>
<p>I wanted to make the book because I haven't seen anything like it out there, but most importantly for it to be used as a tool by parents to enlighten, entertain, and inspire their children. </p>
<p><strong>To teach kids to be courageous, kind, and to know we are not perfect, but we can achieve whatever we want in this life as long as we follow our hearts.</strong></p>

<h1>WHAT WE PLAN TO DO WITH THIS BOOK.</h1>
<p>Our plan for this book is HUGE. We want to start with the release of the book in the United States &amp; Canada, however, we don't want to stop there. Our goal within 1 year is to have it released World Wide. </p>
<p><strong>We are also going to have it submitted as soon as the Illustrations are complete to the following Competitions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Independent Publishers Book Awards</strong></p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Franklin Awards™</strong></p>
<p><strong>Children’s Book Award Contests for Self-published Authors</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Golden Kite Awards</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Moonbeam Children’s Book Awards</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mom’s Choice Awards® </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Royal Dragonfly Book Awards</strong></p>
<h1>IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL WE WILL BEGIN WORK ON ILLUSTRATING  THREE OTHER UNRELEASED NOVELS ""1200 PAGES WORTH""</h1>
<p>Ok, so we are new to Indiegogo and this is our first campaign here, however, if this goes well it will <strong>OPEN UP MANY NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO GIVE YOU EVEN MORE ! </strong>I have FOUR OTHER NOVELS that are unreleased, and if we do well here today, then we will begin work on the others as soon as we get the Illustrations completed for this one.</p>
<h1>WE HAVE EVERYTHING RIDING ON THIS CAMPAIGN AND NEED YOUR UTMOST SUPPORT TO ENABLE US TO KEEP CREATING FOR YOU.</h1>
<h1>CHOOSING THE ILLUSTRATOR </h1>
<p>This was a VERY TEDIOUS PROCESS!! As I stated in the video I had over 300 Illustrators contact me to be a part of this project. I had to go through each individuals portfolios to narrow it down, I do not know how many countless hours I spent reviewing all the submissions, but lets just say it was a lot! </p>
<p>Around 70% of the 300 Illustrators who contacted me were digital artists, and for this project I wanted it to have a classical feel to it. Now, some of the digital artists works were mind blowing, some were even very well known and had worked on multi-million dollar projects, however, it just didn't fit this kind of a story.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to receive a submission from J.E. Larson. I saw something very special and unique in his work. His art was like no one else that submitted and truly stood alone. </p>
<p>**********UPDATE: ANY PLEDGE OF $20 OR MORE WILL GET YOU EVERYTHING INCLUDED IN THE PERTAINING PACKAGE PLUS AN ENTIRE DIGITAL MUSIC ALBUM FROM MY WEBSITE <a href=""http://www.paulwatersmusic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.paulwatersmusic.com</a>  ********</p>

<p>J.E Larson is an internationally known artist with an extensive range of capabilities. He has worked on Published Alice in Wonderland Works, Work for Wired Magazine, and countless other successful authors. He is also one of the NICEST guys I have ever met in my life. We are absolutely honored to have him on board for this project and many others to comes. </p>
<p>J.E. Larson is host to numerous unrelated titles, some of which include barbering, burying and broomstick-watching – and on occasion, chimney-sweeping, crayoning, and hiding in bell towers – but most notably, illustrating. When not confined to the shadows of an ivy embraced abbey or the attic of a confectionery, he attempts to compose to paper visuals of a nonsensical nature with a disposition of mystery, monstrosity, and the macabre. Other times he pretends he is a pirate. An interest in the visual arts was instigated many years ago when he was visiting a rookery while abroad in Romania. It so happened that during this time one of the birds engaged him in conversation, and he having penned a quick sketch of the Parachute Jump – for a visual representation was politely requested – was told by the fowl that the depiction had been very fine. This gracious bit of praise influenced further experimentation and has continued to the present.</p>

<p>We went back and forth so many times on these characters to refine them to what they are now because we were striving to capture the image and colors of them to a ""t"" and this consisted of hundreds of emails, phone calls, meetings, etc. Changing the look of the frog, the bird, the trees, the forest, the colors, different mediums, styles.... needless to say it was a lot of work! </p>
<h1>THE FROG IN THE TREE SEQUEL !</h1>
<p>We don't just want to stop here with this book, our goal is to create numerous stories with the Frog and his little Crow friend. All of these will focus on different aspects of what we need the little ones of the world to learn at an early age. We would LOVE to make this into a series, and with your help today we will be able to begin another book soon for you.</p>

</div></div>","WHY WE WANTED TO DO THIS
Ok, so first of all I wanted to thank you again for taking the time to hear about our story. There has been a massive amount of work that has gone in to it, and WE ARE SO CLOSE! We just need YOUR HELP. We have big dreams for this story. The truth is that we want this book eventually to be released worldwide in many different countries and languages. Right now we just need to get these illustrations complete and to have it self published. 
I am honored to work alongside the world renowned artist J.E. Larson. We have put a lot of time, energy, and money into creating this story and making these characters come to life. 
With your help this book will be FULLY illustrated with extreme attention to detail and lively images that children of all ages will enjoy. 
This book will include 30 full color illustrations done without the use of any computers. The cover, binding, and the back of the book will also be created by J.E. Larson. 

ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE PAGE YOU WILL FIND SOME STUFF WE WANT TO GIVE BACK TO YOU!
This book will become a reality because of YOU. We are so thankful for all your help and support and it's only fair that we give back to you as you are the ones that will make this a dream come true. We want to be very generous with you all and want you to be a part of this books future Because you are it's future!

Anything you can give will get us that much closer to getting this into the hands of kids all over the world.
HOW DO I GET A COPY OF THE PRINTED BOOK? 
 
A PLEDGE OF $25 OR MORE GETS YOU  A PHYSICAL COPY OF THE BOOK!
EVERYONE that pledges $25 or more will get a professionally printed PHYSICAL COPY of THE FROG IN THE TREE BOOK.
TO BE DELIVERED AFTER CAMPAIGN FUNDING IS COMPLETE ""Times may vary depending on the time of print press production"" however, we will get it to as fast as we possibly can!
This is a LIMITED edition Copy. (NOTE: It will not include the full illustrations because we cannot pay the illustrator to draw them until our funding goal is met. However, it includes a full color cover, binding, and back.)  This is a realy great opportunity to get a printed copy before its actual release date. 
WHY DIDN'T YOU USE COMPUTER ILLUSTRATIONS?
That is a good question. Now, we have nothing against computer created art at all, there are tons of books out there that look fantastic in this form, however, we wanted to create a children's book done in the old world style, using the same techniques that our favorite illustrators used dating all the way back to the 15th century. 
It takes a MASSIVE amount of time and hard work to create these illustrations when working with physical tools, and if you screw up an illustration while creating it, there is no erase tool, so, you throw it away and start again. It takes countless hours of tedious work to create each one of these hand drawn illustrations, and we think it pays off in the finished product. 
I grew up on an old farm in upper Michigan, we didnt have computers, cell phones, or video games. I spent my childhood reading the old classical children's stories  that were done in real pen and ink, wood cuts, hand coloring, and meticulously created. 

There is just something special about any piece of art that is created by the hand of the artist, each piece is unique, and one of a kind.




WHAT THE STORY IS ABOUT
Obviously the title will give you some insight as to what the story is about, however, there is a lot more to it then just a frog who lives in a tree. 
I will keep it brief as I do not want to give the story away just yet.  It is written like a poem, a fable you could say. It is a story about a frog who runs away from home as he is teased for being very different than everyone else. He feels lonely, sad, and an outcast and so he shelters himself atop the branches of an old magical oak tree. But something happens to the frog while he is hiding up so high away from the world. 
With the help of a small crow that had fallen from her nest the two embark on a wild, adventurous, and magical journey. 
This story was written to help children understand that it is ok to be yourself. We all look different, feel different, have different ideas, and it's ok to accept the differences of ourselves and of others. 
I wanted to make the book because I haven't seen anything like it out there, but most importantly for it to be used as a tool by parents to enlighten, entertain, and inspire their children. 
To teach kids to be courageous, kind, and to know we are not perfect, but we can achieve whatever we want in this life as long as we follow our hearts.
OVER 100 PRELIMINARY SKETCHES AND DESIGNS JUST TO CREATE THE COVER

WHAT WE PLAN TO DO WITH THIS BOOK.
Our plan for this book is HUGE. We want to start with the release of the book in the United States & Canada, however, we don't want to stop there. Our goal within 1 year is to have it released World Wide. 
We are also going to have it submitted as soon as the Illustrations are complete to the following Competitions:
The Independent Publishers Book Awards
Benjamin Franklin Awards™
Children’s Book Award Contests for Self-published Authors
The Golden Kite Awards
The Moonbeam Children’s Book Awards
The Mom’s Choice Awards® 
The Royal Dragonfly Book Awards
IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL WE WILL BEGIN WORK ON ILLUSTRATING  THREE OTHER UNRELEASED NOVELS ""1200 PAGES WORTH""
Ok, so we are new to Indiegogo and this is our first campaign here, however, if this goes well it will OPEN UP MANY NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO GIVE YOU EVEN MORE ! I have FOUR OTHER NOVELS that are unreleased, and if we do well here today, then we will begin work on the others as soon as we get the Illustrations completed for this one.
WE HAVE EVERYTHING RIDING ON THIS CAMPAIGN AND NEED YOUR UTMOST SUPPORT TO ENABLE US TO KEEP CREATING FOR YOU.
CHOOSING THE ILLUSTRATOR 
This was a VERY TEDIOUS PROCESS!! As I stated in the video I had over 300 Illustrators contact me to be a part of this project. I had to go through each individuals portfolios to narrow it down, I do not know how many countless hours I spent reviewing all the submissions, but lets just say it was a lot! 
Around 70% of the 300 Illustrators who contacted me were digital artists, and for this project I wanted it to have a classical feel to it. Now, some of the digital artists works were mind blowing, some were even very well known and had worked on multi-million dollar projects, however, it just didn't fit this kind of a story.
I was lucky enough to receive a submission from J.E. Larson. I saw something very special and unique in his work. His art was like no one else that submitted and truly stood alone. 
**********UPDATE: ANY PLEDGE OF $20 OR MORE WILL GET YOU EVERYTHING INCLUDED IN THE PERTAINING PACKAGE PLUS AN ENTIRE DIGITAL MUSIC ALBUM FROM MY WEBSITE www.paulwatersmusic.com  ********

<p>My name is Tabatha and among many things I am an ambitious and dedicated writer. I am the proud life supporter of two amazing young boys.  Life as a single mother is rife with sacrifice, struggles and difficult decisions.  Many can spend their entire life searching for their purpose while a busy parent rarely has time for free-forming independent thoughts.  Thankfully, I’ve always known what my life’s purpose has been.  Writing, for me, is the ultimate way to connect with the world and the people that inhabit its space.  I have been accepted into City University London’s MA in writing programme for Fall 2013.  I am looking to raise funds to help with the pre-arrival costs of attending this competitive writing programme.</p>
<h3><strong>WHY:</strong></h3>
<p>When I first moved to London, I was introduced to the struggles and triumphs of one of the strongest and influential female authors, Doris Lessing.  Like Lessing, I too fled to London, foregoing tradition and family to chase down my future.  The first time I stepped out of the black cab’s door into the distinctly aged smell of London I knew that I had found home.  While relating to a troubled childhood, Lessing described the need for creative and physical freedom, ""Yes, I think that is true. Though it wasn't apparent to me then. Of course, I wasn't thinking in terms of being a writer then - I was just thinking about how to escape, all the time.""  London brought me the promise of a new start to life and as a writer.  In reference to her decision to leave behind two young children, Lessing described motherhood in these terms, “There is a whole generation of women,"" she has said, speaking of her mother's era, ""and it was as if their lives came to a stop when they had children. Most of them got pretty neurotic - because, I think, of the contrast between what they were taught at school they were capable of being and what actually happened to them.""  Sixty years since she made her great ‘escape’ I am attempting to follow in her iconic footsteps.  At each intersection and every hurdle, I remind myself of Doris Lessing’s journey and lifelong achievements.  “Whatever you're meant to do, do it now. The conditions are always impossible.” – Doris Lessing</p>
<h3><strong>WHAT:</strong></h3>
<p>My acceptance into City University London’s MA in Writing has been one of my greatest and proudest accomplishments.  Like all worthwhile goals there are some obstacles along the way.  Getting to this point has been a long and at times challenging process.  The vision of boarding the Boeing 747 at Logan International Airport with my youngest son plays in a Technicolor and surround sound loop in my mind; I am still faced with one last obstacle before the visions become a tangible reality.  The initial cost of obtaining Student Visas and the cost of the flight stands in the way of my life purpose.</p>
<p>The estimated cost for my youngest son and I to travel to London this Fall is $2500.  The required Visa’s to enter the UK, combined is $984.  The cost to renew our US Passports is $361.  Flights to the UK range from $400 - $700 per person round trip, bringing a total flight cost to approximately $800 - $1400.  Putting the total cost of getting to London between $2145 and $2745.</p>
<h3><strong>WHEN:</strong></h3>
<p>My plans will go forward regardless of my funding success.  If I cannot raise the funds by the given time than I will defer the start date with City University London for one year. The money I raise will go directly to the expenses associated with arriving and moving to London for this MA in Writing programme.</p>
<p>While applying for the MA programmes, I have encountered and observed the unmet need for traditional support and funding opportunities for single parents interested in pursuing careers in the Arts.  The challenges and hardships I have experienced have strengthened my commitment to helping other single parents follow their passions and talents.  After I finish my Master’s degree I want to find ways to support other single parents with resources and funding to pursue an education or career in the Arts.</p>
<p>If you cannot help by donating but feel that my cause is a worthy and noble venture please share this with people you know! All of your generosity and support is much appreciated!  Thank you for supporting my ambitions and life’s purpose!</p>

My plans will go forward regardless of my funding success.  If I cannot raise the funds by the given time than I will defer the start date with City University London for one year. The money I raise will go directly to the expenses associated with arriving and moving to London for this MA in Writing programme.
While applying for the MA programmes, I have encountered and observed the unmet need for traditional support and funding opportunities for single parents interested in pursuing careers in the Arts.  The challenges and hardships I have experienced have strengthened my commitment to helping other single parents follow their passions and talents.  After I finish my Master’s degree I want to find ways to support other single parents with resources and funding to pursue an education or career in the Arts.
If you cannot help by donating but feel that my cause is a worthy and noble venture please share this with people you know! All of your generosity and support is much appreciated!  Thank you for supporting my ambitions and life’s purpose!
Here is the link to the short story I wrote for my Master’s application!

<h2>Join Me In Creating </h2>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised with the success of my first novel, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Tower-Babel-Vaulan-Cycle-ebook/dp/B0083IXE9K/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em>The Tower of Babel</em>.</a> Now, on November 1, 2013, I'll be publishing the prequel to that book. This time, I want to reach a larger audience: this Indiegogo project will fund, among other things, a web ad campaign that will put the book in front of 400,000 readers. </p>
<p><em>A Chair Between The Rails</em> may challenge readers. Suicide is a resonant theme in the novel, and that may prove uncomfortable. However, the book doesn't compromise its message. Through its startling narrative, it claims that self-sacrifice is always the best choice. For that, it is a book that needs to be read.</p>
<h2>What You're Supporting</h2>
<p>Through lots of research, I've settled on a three-pronged marketing campaign. </p>
<ol>
<li>Dedicated posts from indie.kindlenationdaily.com. I had success with this kind of promo with <em>The Tower of Babel. </em>(cost: $308.99) </li>
<li>Sponsored reviews from The San Francisco Book Review and The Portland Book Review, and entrance into the Indie Reader Discovery Awards. (cost: $344.00) </li>
<li>Web ads on the sites of three major magazines which are read by a portion of the book's target audience: <a href=""http://imagejournal.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Image Journal</a>, <a href=""http://www.relevantmagazine.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Relevant Magazine</a>, and <a href=""http://www.worldmag.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">World Magazine</a>. This will expose the book to 400,000 potential readers. (cost: $1,984.00)  </li>
</ol>
<p>Marketing is not the only cost associated with publishing a novel. Producing the books requires another chunk of change. The cost of book production (and distribution to an estimated number of backers) comes to $765.00. </p>
<p>All of this adds up to $3,401.99. Given Indiegogo's fees (4% for a successful campaign) and payment processing fees (approximately 3%), I've arrived at a total of $3,700.00 for the campaign. </p>
<h2>What You'll Receive </h2>
<p>You'll receive the book, of course. It's a good one--but don't take my word for it; see the reviews of my previous work, <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Tower-Babel-Vaulan-Cycle-ebook/dp/B0083IXE9K/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Tower of Babel</a>.</em> You know, novels are like wine: the longer they mature before you pop the cork, the better they taste; and at six years in, this one is ready to be opened. Consider it some of the most curious vintage you'll try this year. </p>
<p>Several gift levels also include a digital download of an album I recorded, called <em>Come, My Tired Machine</em>. I'll be releasing this work under the artist name <a href=""http://thevictoriousairborne.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Victorious Airborne</a>. (You can stream some of the album at that link.) The music is a bit different, heading in a noise direction sometimes, generally relying on mournful electric guitars the rest of the time. I won't risk comparing it to any artist you have or haven't heard of. Just listen to the tracks at that link and decide if you like it. However, if you do want it, be advised - <strong>this Indiegogo campaign is the only way to obtain the whole album. </strong>It is being released privately only to backers who select a donation level including it. </p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2>Story of My Book</h2><p>PLEASE NOTE THAT THE BOOK HAS A NEW TITLE.</p><p><br/><i>The Ironic Link: How Comedy Overcomes Depression </i>explores the intersection between humor and depression by following the psyche of the comedian. The purpose of this book is to make a compelling argument for comedians as the ultimate tightrope walkers and what we can learn from them. They flourish on the fine line between joy and despair, chaos and order, sanity and madness. A fine line people struggling with mental illnesses find themselves on again and again. This book offers engaging, touching, and eye-opening stories told by famous stand-up comics, renowned psychologists, and myself in an effort to show the critical healing qualities that laughter has on our mental health.</p><p><br/>My name is Felix Dey and I am the author of <i>The Ironic Link</i>. I wrote this book because it is my mission to combat the stigma those with mental health issues are often saddled with. I never suffered from that type of malady, which made it difficult for me to fully relate to, and empathize with someone who does. However, I have always loved bringing out the best in people and making them laugh which is how I found a passion for performing stand-up routines. To my surprise, I discovered that comedy offers a unique way to help us fight our inner demons as well as connect with others who are battling psychiatric disorders.</p><p><br/>In reading this book, I hope it will bring you closer to understanding mental health and help you realize how professionals filter pain through humor to make it hurt less and less, day after day. I have found stand-up to be a wonderful way to connect, bring people together, and turn around their burdens with entertainment. Using humor, we can confront any tough topic. When we can see tragedy through the lens of the ridiculous, it takes away all of its power.</p><p><br/>Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you cope with whatever misery you or a loved one has been put through. We can use fun as a vehicle to make the world less painful. By deconstructing how a comedian’s mind works, you will recognize when you or someone you love is suffering from a mental health condition. This book can help you understand how to laugh through tragedy rather than dying through it. While I can’t guarantee that it will release all your pain, I promise you that it will be a stepping stone along the path to establishing compassion, insight, and an exciting understanding of the world around mental health. Maybe not overnight, but over time.</p><p><br/>In this book, you will learn about the science of depression, and its causes, the power of unmasking yourself and facing the fear of the unknown. Furthermore, you will be encouraged to dig deep into the source of creativity, develop your comedic persona, and learn how hilarity plays a vital role in any facet of our lives.</p><p><br/><i>The Ironic Link</i> taps into topics such as...</p><ul>
<li>The evolution of controversial and taboo-breaking “blue” comedy throughout history.</li>
<li>How comedians are our societal conscious that is pointing out the flaws.</li>
<li>The fascinating mind of the comedian as a tortured soul who finds creativity in the darkest places.</li>
<li>What health benefits positive energy provides to both your physical and emotional wellbeing.</li>
<li>How being a good comedian can make you a better person.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>You will love this book if you enjoy stand-up comedy and want to learn how to bring more absurdity into every aspect of your life - positive and negative. You will also love this book if you ever wondered what the true nature of depression is and how we can fight its stigma.</p><p> </p><h3>The Book - The Ironic Link</h3><p> </p><p>The book is written in 3 parts.</p><p><br/><strong>Part 1, The Case for Comedy</strong>, contains the introduction + chapters 1-4.<br/>It will take you back to where stand-up comedy has its roots, showcasing how iconic comedians such as Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor risked their careers as they fought for the freedom of expression. On top of that, to understand how to overcome depression, we have to understand the different reasons you or someone close to you might be miserable. This chapter will show you that there’s more behind it than just a chemical imbalance in our brains. Lastly, I will take you on my personal journey when I experienced mental challenges throughout childhood with an emotionally abusive father and challenging times during college.</p><p><br/><strong>Part 2, The Weirdo in the Room</strong>, contains chapters 5-8.<br/>This part takes you into the minds of big-name comedians such as Robin Williams, Patton Oswalt, and Sarah Silverman, and different challenges they used comedy to overcome. Comedy can be a lifesaver for many, but it is not a substitute for professional help, according to comedian Chris Gethard. In a brutally honest yet entertaining manner, he tells stories about suicidal thoughts and depressive phases he’s been through, which unveils the dark side of the world of comedy.</p><p><br/><strong>Part 3, Comedy is Funny ... and so Much More</strong>, contains chapters 9-11.<br/>Learning how to be amusing can be like investigating how to be a good human. Particularly current generations move the standard towards a more compassionate and better-educated society around mental health by being open and vulnerable - characteristics of any high-quality stand-up comic. On top of that, along the way of performing professionally, I became a better entrepreneur. In both worlds, it is about failure, perseverance, and resilience.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h3><p> </p><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

There are also a couple of other packs you can order to get peices from the upcoming Paranorm World Jewelry Collection (handmade by me) and/or Paranorm World Black Blade Guard T-shirts (also designed by me).
 
VOODOO MOON BY JUNE STEVENS 
After a worldwide cataclysm and wars broke down society and changed the landscape of the world, a new society had to take shape.  The magic users and paranormal beings that spent centuries in hiding and were relegated to myth and legend had to come out of hiding to save the world that shunned them.  Now witches, vampires, shifters and normal humans live side by side in a society that was built by merging technology and magic.
In the ruins of old cities new ones formed.  New governments rule.  Within the walls of the autonomous city-states that have risen up  with a City Guard on every corner and the Black Blade Guard, an elite Paranorm law force that dates back centuries before the Cataclysm and hunts down the worst Paranorm criminals, life is relatively safe. Or it should be.
Beyond the walls in the outer-zones is where the real outlaws live.  Right?
Zombies aren’t supposed to exist, yet they are turning up all over Nash City.
As a member of the Elite Black Blade Guard, Fiona Moon is tasked with hunting down the most dangerous Paranorm criminals. Now she must find out who is kidnapping mages and sucking the life energy from their bodies. To make matters worse, she has to work with the one man that embodies everything she despises.
Ian Barroes is the rich founder and head of the Necromancers Guild and a professor of Necromantic Studies at the Academy of Science and Magic. There is one thing he wants more than anything else in the world... Fiona. They each hold secrets that could destroy them but could also be the key to destroying the evil Voodoo priest, Bokur. They must learn to trust each other track down Bokur before more innocents are taken, and murdered. To make matters worse, when Fiona becomes a target of the evil madman she is lured into his trap. Now she and Ian have to fight for survival and their very souls.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The Summer of Love, Hippies, Dancing in the Streets, Peace, Love and Rock-n-Roll...The stories of the sixties in the USA are familiar to many people but there is something missingâ€”children's stories. What was Janis Joplin like as a six year old? Where was Jerry Garcia when he picked up his first instrument and was it a guitar? Was Jimi Hendrix a quiet kid?  What is the name of that anonymous child with the peace sign painted on her cheek in that famous photo? <i style=""font-weight: bold;"">Flower Children </i>will tell these stories and more as a series of contemporary picture book biographies (an award winning format in the children's literature world). </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our world is in the midst of changes that are far reaching. Telling the stories of children who became artists whose music and art impacted social movements helps everyone have a deeper understanding of children and creativity. Now more than ever we need to be aware of the next generation. Icons were once kids. Stories shape culture. <i style=""font-weight: bold;"">Flower Children</i> will offer a new generation hope at a time when hope may be all we have left. Flower Children will also help stop bullying of the creative ""weird"" kids.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Funding for <i style=""font-weight: bold;"">Flower Children</i> will be used for research in order to craft a solid proposal that is ready for submission to an editor who is seeking manuscripts. Funds are needed for ink, paper, library time and miscellaneous fees. Field work is also critical to non-fiction research so some funds will be used to visit relevant locations. In the end, the hope is that the <i style=""font-weight: bold;"">Flower Children </i>series will be published by an established publisher with an excellent track record in the area of non-fiction for young readers.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Do you have primary source materials related to icons of the 60s? Were you 'there'? What do your favorite libraries and museums have to offer on the times? <i style=""font-weight: bold;"">Flower Children</i> is open to your input and research support!</p>

<p>You're real. Your poems are real.</p>
<p>- Denise Levertov, in a letter in 1970</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I can't imagine how you go that far inside to access these precision experience outpourings of reality. ..your work..has that great “welcome disturbing” effect of Pablo Neruda....</p>
<p>FREQUENTLY you are so so new and fresh. It's a REAL POET when their words lead reality. Hard to explain but I know you get it....</p>
<p>- Prem Geet</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each word so simply &amp; clearly in the right place at the right time...I get a feeling of profound...wholeness, completion, appreciation, happiness, comprehension...yet I can't express it. Whilst reading this poem...when I got to certain lines... I started weeping...</p>
<p>- Rudra</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your magic poetry reaches just underneath the skin and tugs us into reality for a few brief joyous pleasure moments. Yay!</p>
<p>- Prem Geet</p>
<p> </p>
<p>...Such hidden depths are gently yet vibrantly lit...</p>
<p>- Nidhi Rice</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What a gift you have to transmit in words!</p>
<p>- Upchara</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every once in a while, you come into my consciousness – via Osho News or another look at your website. I always enjoy reading what you write – even though the subject doesn't often interest me.</p>
<p>I think that says something significant – about you.</p>
<p>- Rama Prem</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is a great privilege to publish (your poems....) I feel that in discovering your thoughtful, philosophical and sensitive poetry a new light has been shone on the world of nature and the mind for me. Thank you for sharing it.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>..This is incredible writing. I cannot believe a teenager wrote it. More poetry than prose.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>..You have a talent for expressing yourself with absolute clarity, sincerity and groundedness...</p>

<p>I have read your poetry, and I like it.</p>
<p>- Kohrogi-sensei</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have all felt these things. We who bother to look. But we do not know how to say it. And we feel alone, until we read your words. You unite our insides. ..</p>
<p>- Sandhano Moorsteen</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you for being so wild and unruly and sensual. And eloquent about it.</p>

<p>About the poem Heroes:</p>
<p>This poem is exquisite!</p>
<p>- Prabha</p>
<p>I was just reading about child predators when I read your poem. How beautifully you tell the story, the overcoming. Through the fire, bringing beauty from ashes.</p>
<p>- Elizabeth Bordeaux</p>
<p>Your AMAZING poem has kicked off the healing of a lifetime. Tears, past lives....</p>
<p>- Prem Geet</p>
<p>Your poem is beautiful. I say it again: Beautiful!</p>

<p>...A real presence as a poet.</p>
<p>- Bob Horne, Puzzle Poets open mic. Sowerby Bridge</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your voice and imagination sparks something in me which is very nearly like touching a spark of eternity, a transformed myself – so that I can witness consciousness experiencing itself through the life, words and imaginative forms of another human being.</p>
<p>- David Roberts</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You are a good writer. I am no great critic but I've been enjoying your stories, though I do find myself envying your youthful ventures in Poona – but, in my opinion, your writing is well constructed and easy to read..as well as very well expressed and the content is very interesting to me also.</p>
<p>- Julian</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You write in such an extraordinary way – your use of words is very agile and stimulating.</p>
<p>- Dawn Golten</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the article How Clinging Happens:</p>
<p>I shall read it again and again. Perfect. Addiction...defying one's personal truth in the moment makes one cling. Ahhh finally the solar plexus pain has softened, if only for a moment. Maybe longer. Understanding is good medicine.</p>
<p>- Kerina Moorsteen</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the vid of the song Three Years Ago:</p>
<p>So fleshy, heart-y, sweet oh you amazing poet you. Reminds me of William Butler Yeats! Now that's a compliment. Mad, you make me laugh a lot, can't help it.</p>
<p>- Prem Geet</p>
<p>Brave and beautiful. A love song to the earth...Lots of Fun...Yes and the song and the stones made me ache for a walk on the fells.</p>

<p>Impassioned Cows by Moonlight:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(Katy Akin) is as good as Burroughs. Somebody, looking for a new, raw, original literary talent should snap her up...</p>
<p>- Noel Young, editor, Capra Press, 1977</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your youthful poems: quiet descriptive ferocity. So many perfect words...</p>
<p>- Carl Gancher</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Akin's empathy with others is deep and felt with considerable originality. She has a special way of moving somehow into the skin of those she loves.</p>
<p>Akin's poems are warm, pulsing pieces of warm fur.</p>
<p>The prose pieces are as adept as the poetry..</p>
<p>Akin's is a talent of major proportions. I hope that her life is her writing, and that more work will reach us, spun from the incredible seams of her special living...it doesn't matter if her craft is deliberate or intuitive – her poems work wonderfully well.</p>
<p>Katy Akin is a damned good poet.</p>

<p>Love at Dancing Leaves: a Tantra Memoir</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just being near your book, I feel inside humming and thrilled...something sacred has arrived!</p>
<p>Reads like a juicy novel with such valuable treasures of profound wisdom and practical instructions, all woven together in your own inimitable, captivating style.</p>
<p>I can only imagine people will love it and be tremendously benefited by it.</p>
<p>..You write so well, so poetic, so articulate, so preserving of the mystery and sacredness of all the experiences you share with us...You put words so well to what is for me unexpressable beauty. It seems so important that all this be shared...</p>
<p>- Deva Vibha</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am so completely wrapped up in reading your book I can't put it away. Reading it is like making love in the most exquisite way, like being embraced and cradled in sweet and lovely honey dew...it is a masterpiece – a song, a dance...of words that flow so effortlessly...like pearls pearling out of your deepest source of beingness empowering the reader...You are amazing Madhuri I am in awe.</p>
<p>Every woman needs to read this book and get empowered by it in her own unique womanness...</p>
<p>- Veet Nisarg</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The more I read, the more I love your book. ..So many words you write touch my heart and remind me of depths within...Your words ring true in my heart...as beautifully sincere and real as you can possibly be.</p>
<p>...I also enjoy and admire your way with using words, but more important for me is the energy that is transmitted...</p>
<p>Even in Sedona, we suffer form intense boring untruthfulness! And watching the news just makes one sick. Which is why each night as I go to sleep, I read a few pages of your book. It is cleansing, refreshing, funny, delightful, warm, human, wonderful! What a treasure you are.</p>
<p>- Leela Lovegarden</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You did a super job with this book. It is so real, funny, poignant, honest, creative, deep...</p>
<p>- Mary Ann Winiger</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just a note to say how delightful I find your writing style. ..I hope many find your book and read it, you are doing a fabulous job of sharing Osho's tantric teachings.</p>
<p>- Shaeri Richards</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just finishing your book...it is such a thing of beauty, wanting to thank you again for sharing yourself with such honesty. It is truly awesome and ohhh so well written! How I admire your litheness and lightness, your dancing and your bliss and creativity and your not avoiding anything but bravely exploring it ALL, allowing darkness and warts, in depths. Being so slow and earthbound myself...it is truly revealing that a life like yours can be had.</p>
<p>I laughed out loud, felt innerly touched and much mouth watering happend as your lovely descriptions of food rolled by...what a wonderful story and unfolding love between the two of you, how magic clean and true.</p>
<p>- Leena Danoe</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This warm and wooly memoir is as sassy, quirky and tender as its author – one of Osho's earliest Western disciples, intrepid witness, incurable artist, devotee...</p>
<p>This book could only be written by one who comes to life with a simple, grateful Yes.</p>
<p>- Prartho Sereno</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You are a great story teller, very imaginative and perceptive, wickedly intelligent....You are the real deal.</p>
<p>- Robert Banker</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Love it, gripped. A beautiful book. Its beauty and intimacy and truth are what hit you.</p>
<p>I want to say that after reading sections of your book, generally about 30 or so pages at a time, I would feel so loving! It also somehow made me appreciate Purushottama (also a Missouri lad) even more.... It helps a kind of relaxation happen and that wonderful sense of merging and not being a separate being. So thank you. You are so open in this book but nothing feels exaggerated. It has a kind of muted respectful feel. ...Understated. And so much acceptance...</p>
<p>To read this book is to be exposed to an intimacy and depth of truth that few writers have the courage to explore. It is a love story but there is no hiding from reality, no losing oneself in fantasy and creating an unreal image of the other. The writer reveals herself and in so doing hidden parts of the reader come to light. At times I laughed deliciously, in other places tears streamed, sometimes from sadness but often from the beauty expressed. It reveals the evolution of love of self, and other, with an undercurrent of acceptance of what is, an exploration of what is, and it leaves you with many tools for your own journey.</p>
<p>- Amido Goodnight</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I started to read your book last night and was instantly engrossed!...What I am enjoying is just savouring how you put the words on the page. That is my favourite kind of reading.</p>
<p>I will be astonished if your book does not find its way into the valued literature of the world.</p>
<p>- Kumud</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've read so many hundreds of books classic or otherwise, and I see that yours is so unique that it will instigate a whole new movement, not only in literature, but in life!</p>
<p>Almost halfway through...So beautiful fun interesting captivating mysterious. So detailed yet inclusive &amp; integrative, insights into pulsations betwixt regular mundane doings &amp; subtle esoteric energies!</p>
<p>And so satisfyingly fat!</p>
<p>...True abundance! I'm sure a plenitude of others will feel the same.</p>
<p>- Rudra</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Reading and very much enjoying...You are a great descriptive writer.</p>
<p>- Celest Brown</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This book is so amazingly beautiful...I just started it last night and couldn't put it down, which totally surprised me because it's only really good thrillers that catch me that way.</p>
<p>You have so beautifully caught the exquisite crazyness of our lives I think, those of us who lived with him...totally ORDINARY, and totally totally mystical, and we take it all for granted somehow, or not for granted, but dissolving into the great something as an ordinary part of life, which most people don't experience in a imillion lifetimes.</p>
<p>Your book has shown me so much, what we carry and can open others to...</p>
<p>That is the first thing – know what you are carrying – it is HUGE.</p>
<p>...Anyway this book is incredible. It is just freaking incredible...</p>
<p>- Peggy Sands</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm reading your book, an adventure unto itself...How to say: it is surprising, confronting, and delightful. SO straightforward about things hardly anyone talks about, let alone writes down in detailed descriptions...You also describe very well the places, situations, people, and the food too! As I read I grow to know all of those, and to love them..and the depth from which you come, whether shopping or meditating or tantra-ing, is marvellous..and above all inspiring..I'm printing a chapter, “Music,” to send to my 34-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>- Brahmani</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm slowly making my way through Dancing Leaves, reading it with the care it deserves. I think about the depths of your explorations, reflect on my own dealings in these matters and make some notes. Your words are so descriptive, your exercises so necessary and your narrative so close to real human experiences – warts and all. It teases a part of my brain and my heart that has rarely been touched. I am thrilled by that and grateful too.</p>
<p>...Reading about your early years...such graphic images, teeth, filth, dryness, sex, loneliness, the positive poles of the breasts, hurt, glee, mischief, and luminosity of a soul on fire. Yes I'm still caressing the leaves of your life – holding them for a moment and scattering them as the fall from my hand...I want you to know I did listen. I learned too.</p>
<p>...Reading Dancing Leaves has left me spellbound with your ability to linger with a difficult atmosphere between you and Neil when you tried to speak but faced the experience alone...Maybe there is no other way. We have to face these small deaths alone. Things do pop because of it!</p>
<p>I read your experiences and I grow calm thinking I'm not alone dying when my partner is mute. Thank you for sharing your journey (in all the ways that you do) you will never know how much it means to me.</p>
<p>- Yuri Zelez</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Best Tantra book ever. (I'm) much more interested in people and personal stories, and how to sometimes step out of them, than just theory and technique.</p>
<p>- Kerina Moorsteen</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I finished your book. It was so honest and funny and sweet and really feel like I know you now. My favourite bit was when you were trying to do laughing meditation in the church, it had me in fits of laughter myself. ..</p>
<p>- Bria</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am so impressed in how you describe (in) words – they are so rich with liveliness and so visual – the reader is really pulled in, this is the type of writing I love. Your descriptions are really genius! It inspires me to write as well.</p>
<p>- Megan Pacetti</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I agree with all your other fans. Your writing is really compelling, delightful to read, and so far very intriguing – and although I have no idea where the story goes....so far you've got my attention.</p>
<p>- Krishna Priya</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is pretty wild for a slightly stuffy Midwestern man to be with a wild witchy beauty like you – and love it! The book is absolutely mindblowingly engaging...Darling, the book is fascinating. You have really done something wonderful.</p>
<p>- Elizabeth Bordeaux</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's so rich and real...I don't ever feel preached at or being convinced...it's an extraordinary thing in a not-very-dramatic way and you get to watch it all unfold...If a cynical, mystically challenged person like me can take sweet refreshing draws from your book...the rest of the world should be swimming in it!</p>
<p>- Dalayna Williams</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I joined your workshop yesterday at the Tantric Festival in Rotterdam ...It was sublime and had a deepness and intensity that is rare in the workshops in Holland that I have joined over the last years.</p>
<p>I am still a bit shaken at this moment – since I just found out you are the author of Love at Dancing Leaves...one of my 2 most cherished 'tantric' books – the other being Daniel Odier's story about his personal journey.</p>
<p>Therefore – a deep bow and thank you!...</p>
<p>- Rudolf Eeken</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Engaging...I like the way you use words and phrasings. ..Craftsmanship...sweetness of the language, and when it demands you become devastatingly clinical. But the poetry of the prose dominates the cascading flow of the writing, and which is why I like it...I just felt I wished I were a tiny part of that journey.</p>
<p>- Samuel Dani</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just finished reading your book! Wow! What a book! I'm truly amazed, delighted, touched, and grateful.</p>
<p>When I first started it I whizzed through the first 50 pages or so totally enthralled with it and wondered, “Is she going to be able to keep this up for 500 pages?” And you did ! Amazing!</p>
<p>I most love your honesty and openness. It's very difficult for me to perceive a woman's world and I sense I got a good glimpse of it because of you. ..</p>
<p>- Ansula</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Beautiful! Congratulations!</p>
<p>- Deva and Miten</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The book is so magical I never want it to end. When does the sequel come out?</p>
<p>- Kerina Moorsteen</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Love at at Dancing Leaves arrived in my life a few days ago...such a joy to peruse, feel, bathe in...thank you so much for your beauty, love and vitality...and also so sweet of you to acknowledge me in your book...I must say I found it really intriguing, full of zest and heart. I really enjoyed reading your Tantric cameos – such a sweetness and playfulness, lightness and innocence...</p>
<p>- Satya Puja</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I feel like I am frolicking through a leafy forest...You write with transcendent clarity which seems to add an additional dimension – not the 3rd, perhaps, but maybe the 51/2th.</p>
<p>- Huck Akin</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I started reading Love at Dancing Leaves late last night and only got as far as page 8, the reason being that I found myself re-reading nearly every sentence to savor every word and phrase.</p>
<p>I have bachelor degrees in Literature and History...I think, or like to think, I know good writing when I see it....Until last night, I considered you to be a somewhat talented, but more so deluded writer...I was expecting a sappy, sophomoric romance novel...I was Wrong...Have you read Black Lamb and Gray Falcon by Rebecca West or Bury Me Standing by a female author named Fonseca? Those two books left me in awe of the authors' range and talent, and if your book holds up for the next 497 pages, I'll be adding you to that list.</p>
<p>- Robert Banker</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Like sipping nectar from acorn cups.</p>
<p>- Dalayna Williams</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What a pleasure it is to read you: such beautiful writing, with lovely images, lyrical metaphors. The often-musical rhythm and flow spill over and through it. You write with so many felcitious phrases and words coined along the way!</p>
<p>You're definitely a wordsmith – a high compliment in my book.</p>
<p>- Nanette McGuinness, editor</p>
<p> </p>
<p>More About the Moon</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm just knocked sideways by the majestic language and clarity of More About the Moon and your poetry in general! Everything, from the feel of the book to its sylvan illustrations...and the magnificent words within, has warmed my heart.</p>
<p>- Simon Zonnenblick, editor, Caterpillar Poetry</p>
<p> </p>
<p>...Alive with deep personal insights from someone who has experienced the world in ways which many of us can only dream of.</p>
<p>Glorious reflections of life shining like jewels in time.</p>
<p>Between two beautiful cover pictures Madhuri's book of poetry offers a vibrant glimpse of life reflected with focus and clarity....I really enjoyed the broad range of experience and vivid connection with each poem and could not put her book down.</p>
<p>Wonderful value.</p>
<p>- Keith Fielder</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Madhuri's (book of) poetry arrived...what a wonderful gift! I had no idea she could write like that...so beautiful.</p>
<p>- Anupam</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The book is absolutely magical. When I need a bit of magic, whimsy and fairy wings! - I get it out and treat myself, really like opening candy.</p>
<p>- Kerina Moorsteen</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I bought 5 or 6 More About the Moon and gifted them to friends and family...You are so talented and it is inspiring to see your continued blossoming.</p>
<p>- Jim Chambers</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Leave your mind at the door, with your shoes. Madhuri will take you on a journey that will leave you quiet, centered, and enriched. She takes a lifetime of searching, putting pen to paper in the most intense and enlightening moments, sharing those moments to the universe. For anyone who can tune in, and let them take them with her on her path..it's a profound and moving life;s journal...of one remarkable woman's spiritual footsteps.</p>
<p>- William Shepherd (Guru)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your book is beautiful! It's like a song with so much feeling – like you're one with everything.</p>
<p>Thank you for the poem about our childhood.....</p>
<p>- Diana Drake Gall</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just about to read more of the poems before bed. They have a soothing effect. I love More About the Moon.</p>
<p>- Alison Darmbrough</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just reading the first poem in the book, written when she could not have been more than sixteen, I am delighted by the maturity of the voice – the haiku-like observation of the world around her....and then she takes us on a marvellous journey through her life, across continents and worlds, through love and pain and sorrow and joy, coming and going, learning, and leaving. And in that journey the voice matures, becomes more precise, and takes on that quality, which is perhaps beyond the ken of the very young, where “I” dissolves and the poet really does become the poetry:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And one is leaning out the window</p>
<p>over the light lichens crusted on the roof tiles</p>
<p>and the air is clean and cool as water,</p>
<p>and one is so gently full of joy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(from leaning Out a Window in Tuscany, 2009.)</p>
<p>Read this small book. It is a true gift.</p>
<p>- Krishna Gopa</p>
<p> </p>
<p>..Your book is an amazing treasure. I enjoy reading it and often hear your voice while reading in it...sometimes becoming part of the night-walk or moon-gazing party. Thanks..for this amazing present.</p>
<p>- Ramya</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your poems are magnificent...true and wise and innocent. Non-cliche purity...</p>
<p>- Prartho Sereno, Poet Laureate, Marin Co, Calif.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Madhuri, you are truly a gifted writer. Your words dance right into my heart...so rich, so sensual and poetic all at once.</p>
<p>- Shaeri Richards</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Very deep and joyfull – rarely poetry can hold my attention but yours I read every word. Thank you.</p>
<p>- Kamala</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Deeply felt.</p>
<p>Beautifully said.</p>
<p>A flowering is emerging...</p>

<p>The other day I was reading my beloved Osho! who speaks about how history is really only half of the human story and that the feminine side is missing because the way we experience is so impossible to language. This is where your poetry pours into that empty book of who we are and how we are. I am reminded of the cathedral builders who for 4 or 5 generations cut stone, hauled rock, sanded stone, laid stone, but never saw the cathedral at all or their impact across centuries and cultures. This is you! Sure, you write for you but you write for generations down the line and you open more doors for expression to pour out of women, giving them permission!</p>
<p>- Prem Geet</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I read More About the Moon voraciously cover to cover...It came at just the right moment...Your poems are magnificent..true and wise and innocent....None of that fancy mental footwork that abounds these days, but non-cliche purity, as clear and mysterious as the moon herself.</p>
<p>- Prartho Sereno</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Madhuri is the most creative person I know. She is an excellent visual artist, producing watercolors, line drawings, and greeting cards. But, to me, she is above and beyond, a master of words, way beyond being a “word smith.” ...The words line up..they beguile me, invite me in. Many of her poems are spare, but they are larger on the inside...</p>
<p>She has a robust toolbox of (these) phrase turns, a cadence choreograophy, and emotional influxes..called on to sculpt each poem. This toolbox has been evident throughout her time line. The voice is comfortably consistent, but displayed perfectly for each poem, in each content. And there is the Moon in each one this time.</p>
<p>- Carl Gancher</p>
<p> </p>
<p>...This poet sits at the hem of the Divine moon's illumined gown and takes notes...</p>
<p>Osho speaks about the wholeness of higher mathematics versus ordinary mathematics and says, “The same is true about all the higher values. A beautiful poem is not just the words that compose it; it is something more. Otherwise anybody who can put words together in a rhythmical form will become a Shakespeare, a Kalidas, a Milton, a Shelley. Then any linguist, grammarian will become a great poet. That does not happen. You may know the whole grammar of language, you may be acquainted with all the words of the language, still to be a poet is a totally different phenomenon. Poetry comes first, then come the words, not vice versa – it is not that you arrange the words and the poetry arises.</p>
<p>- Osho, I Am That, ch 9</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I really like More About the Moon. To my eyes and ears you have an authentic voice.</p>
<p>- Satyam</p>
<p> </p>
<p>...Tremendous appreciation for your imagery, ability to write rhythmically and the passion for life, love and getting to the bottom of it all that permeates your creativity.</p>
<p>- Amido Goodnight</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Madhuri's primal poetry is one beautiful individualistic example of how poetry comes first, across a lifetime, as a way of relating to life, mining a relationship to Self...A mo-n-mad mystical trek over four decades...</p>
<p>Throughout recorded history, it seems that poets would have depleted the Moon's imagery by now, but Madhuri's latest moon-licious book proves that the Cool She is inexhaustible, rich beyond imagining, as many-faced as we are....Her amazing book is a rare moon-guided journey from a woman's waxing pubescence to the fullness of her own oceanic presence...the Night Pearl continues to reveal Herself in altogether new ways as long as there is a witnessing, pulsating mystic looking up... Madhuri reveals a rare gift, as if following the best poetic advice from..Ezra Pound who said simply, “Make it new.”</p>

<p>(Re audio version:) First of all, there is your voice: it is mellow yet acrobatic in its flexibility. It is soothing and draws me in...I loved the crescendo section...And your rhythms:...prit'neer perfect...It was very musical in its rhythms, driven by your sweet facile voice.</p>
<p>And your thought stream: A thorough and insightful journey through sweet meadows, glades and ponds, bypassing negativity and linking up with the positive cosmic conscious mode..and there were many times I was jolted with the brilliance of the turns of phrase. I made pleased sounds: hoots, guffaws, sighs (with a shake of the head), and many repeats of the spoken word “AMAZING”.</p>

...are you in it?
 
Funding humbly hoped-for, for a new book of poems written between 1973 and 2004, in Osho's communes in Poona and the Ranch; also some from Goa, the Himalayas, Sri Lanka...
These are poems about romantic love gone good or bad, about discipleship, about the mysteries of being in a Buddhafield. and a few adventures on Enfields.
Seeking 1,200 pounds, for formatting and publicizing, and putting this book (approx. 260 pages) onto Kindle, and Lulu.com.
 
a sample...
 
in silence
 
ten days she did not talk.
but once,
burned thumb in tea
 
the body talked.
 
- 1975
 
Madhuri is the author of Impassioned Cows by Moonlight, Love at Dancing Leaves: a Tantra Memoir, More About the Moon, and A Colourful Dessert of Flowers. 
Born in California, she is a nomad with a few roots in England.
 
Praise for Madhuri's writing:
 
Madhuri is a very good poet.
- Osho
 
You're real. Your poems are real.
- Denise Levertov, in a letter in 1970
 
I can't imagine how you go that far inside to access these precision experience outpourings of reality. ..your work..has that great “welcome disturbing” effect of Pablo Neruda....
FREQUENTLY you are so so new and fresh. It's a REAL POET when their words lead reality. Hard to explain but I know you get it....
- Prem Geet
 
Each word so simply & clearly in the right place at the right time...I get a feeling of profound...wholeness, completion, appreciation, happiness, comprehension...yet I can't express it. Whilst reading this poem...when I got to certain lines... I started weeping...
- Rudra
 
Your magic poetry reaches just underneath the skin and tugs us into reality for a few brief joyous pleasure moments. Yay!
- Prem Geet
 
...Such hidden depths are gently yet vibrantly lit...
- Nidhi Rice
 
What a gift you have to transmit in words!
- Upchara
 
Every once in a while, you come into my consciousness – via Osho News or another look at your website. I always enjoy reading what you write – even though the subject doesn't often interest me.
I think that says something significant – about you.
- Rama Prem
 
It is a great privilege to publish (your poems....) I feel that in discovering your thoughtful, philosophical and sensitive poetry a new light has been shone on the world of nature and the mind for me. Thank you for sharing it.
- Simon Zonnenblick, Caterpillar Poetry magazine
 
 
..This is incredible writing. I cannot believe a teenager wrote it. More poetry than prose.
- Kerina Moorsteen, (about short story, Meralda.)
 
..You have a talent for expressing yourself with absolute clarity, sincerity and groundedness...
- Kavi
 
I have read your poetry, and I like it.
- Kohrogi-sensei
 
We have all felt these things. We who bother to look. But we do not know how to say it. And we feel alone, until we read your words. You unite our insides. ..
- Sandhano Moorsteen
 
Thank you for being so wild and unruly and sensual. And eloquent about it.
- Sandhano Morsteen
 
Deep, wild, fearless, tender, sacred, rebellious, reverent...
- Sandhano Moorsteen
 
About the poem Heroes:
This poem is exquisite!
- Prabha
I was just reading about child predators when I read your poem. How beautifully you tell the story, the overcoming. Through the fire, bringing beauty from ashes.
- Elizabeth Bordeaux
Your AMAZING poem has kicked off the healing of a lifetime. Tears, past lives....
- Prem Geet
Your poem is beautiful. I say it again: Beautiful!
- Kohrogi-sensei
 
...A real presence as a poet.
- Bob Horne, Puzzle Poets open mic. Sowerby Bridge
 
Your voice and imagination sparks something in me which is very nearly like touching a spark of eternity, a transformed myself – so that I can witness consciousness experiencing itself through the life, words and imaginative forms of another human being.
- David Roberts
 
You are a good writer. I am no great critic but I've been enjoying your stories, though I do find myself envying your youthful ventures in Poona – but, in my opinion, your writing is well constructed and easy to read..as well as very well expressed and the content is very interesting to me also.
- Julian
 
You write in such an extraordinary way – your use of words is very agile and stimulating.
- Dawn Golten
 
On the article How Clinging Happens:
I shall read it again and again. Perfect. Addiction...defying one's personal truth in the moment makes one cling. Ahhh finally the solar plexus pain has softened, if only for a moment. Maybe longer. Understanding is good medicine.
- Kerina Moorsteen
 
On the vid of the song Three Years Ago:
So fleshy, heart-y, sweet oh you amazing poet you. Reminds me of William Butler Yeats! Now that's a compliment. Mad, you make me laugh a lot, can't help it.
- Prem Geet
Brave and beautiful. A love song to the earth...Lots of Fun...Yes and the song and the stones made me ache for a walk on the fells.
- Nirguna
 
 
Impassioned Cows by Moonlight:
 
(Katy Akin) is as good as Burroughs. Somebody, looking for a new, raw, original literary talent should snap her up...
- Noel Young, editor, Capra Press, 1977
 
Your youthful poems: quiet descriptive ferocity. So many perfect words...
- Carl Gancher
 
Akin's empathy with others is deep and felt with considerable originality. She has a special way of moving somehow into the skin of those she loves.
Akin's poems are warm, pulsing pieces of warm fur.
The prose pieces are as adept as the poetry..
Akin's is a talent of major proportions. I hope that her life is her writing, and that more work will reach us, spun from the incredible seams of her special living...it doesn't matter if her craft is deliberate or intuitive – her poems work wonderfully well.
Katy Akin is a damned good poet.
Robert Peters, 1975
 
...A young visionary.
- Gene Detro, 1976
 
Love at Dancing Leaves: a Tantra Memoir
 
Just being near your book, I feel inside humming and thrilled...something sacred has arrived!
Reads like a juicy novel with such valuable treasures of profound wisdom and practical instructions, all woven together in your own inimitable, captivating style.
I can only imagine people will love it and be tremendously benefited by it.
..You write so well, so poetic, so articulate, so preserving of the mystery and sacredness of all the experiences you share with us...You put words so well to what is for me unexpressable beauty. It seems so important that all this be shared...
- Deva Vibha
 
I am so completely wrapped up in reading your book I can't put it away. Reading it is like making love in the most exquisite way, like being embraced and cradled in sweet and lovely honey dew...it is a masterpiece – a song, a dance...of words that flow so effortlessly...like pearls pearling out of your deepest source of beingness empowering the reader...You are amazing Madhuri I am in awe.
Every woman needs to read this book and get empowered by it in her own unique womanness...
- Veet Nisarg
 
The more I read, the more I love your book. ..So many words you write touch my heart and remind me of depths within...Your words ring true in my heart...as beautifully sincere and real as you can possibly be.
...I also enjoy and admire your way with using words, but more important for me is the energy that is transmitted...
Even in Sedona, we suffer form intense boring untruthfulness! And watching the news just makes one sick. Which is why each night as I go to sleep, I read a few pages of your book. It is cleansing, refreshing, funny, delightful, warm, human, wonderful! What a treasure you are.
- Leela Lovegarden
 
You did a super job with this book. It is so real, funny, poignant, honest, creative, deep...
- Mary Ann Winiger
 
Just a note to say how delightful I find your writing style. ..I hope many find your book and read it, you are doing a fabulous job of sharing Osho's tantric teachings.
- Shaeri Richards
 
Just finishing your book...it is such a thing of beauty, wanting to thank you again for sharing yourself with such honesty. It is truly awesome and ohhh so well written! How I admire your litheness and lightness, your dancing and your bliss and creativity and your not avoiding anything but bravely exploring it ALL, allowing darkness and warts, in depths. Being so slow and earthbound myself...it is truly revealing that a life like yours can be had.
I laughed out loud, felt innerly touched and much mouth watering happend as your lovely descriptions of food rolled by...what a wonderful story and unfolding love between the two of you, how magic clean and true.
- Leena Danoe
 
This warm and wooly memoir is as sassy, quirky and tender as its author – one of Osho's earliest Western disciples, intrepid witness, incurable artist, devotee...
This book could only be written by one who comes to life with a simple, grateful Yes.
- Prartho Sereno
 
You are a great story teller, very imaginative and perceptive, wickedly intelligent....You are the real deal.
- Robert Banker
 
Love it, gripped. A beautiful book. Its beauty and intimacy and truth are what hit you.
I want to say that after reading sections of your book, generally about 30 or so pages at a time, I would feel so loving! It also somehow made me appreciate Purushottama (also a Missouri lad) even more.... It helps a kind of relaxation happen and that wonderful sense of merging and not being a separate being. So thank you. You are so open in this book but nothing feels exaggerated. It has a kind of muted respectful feel. ...Understated. And so much acceptance...
To read this book is to be exposed to an intimacy and depth of truth that few writers have the courage to explore. It is a love story but there is no hiding from reality, no losing oneself in fantasy and creating an unreal image of the other. The writer reveals herself and in so doing hidden parts of the reader come to light. At times I laughed deliciously, in other places tears streamed, sometimes from sadness but often from the beauty expressed. It reveals the evolution of love of self, and other, with an undercurrent of acceptance of what is, an exploration of what is, and it leaves you with many tools for your own journey.
- Amido Goodnight
 
I started to read your book last night and was instantly engrossed!...What I am enjoying is just savouring how you put the words on the page. That is my favourite kind of reading.
I will be astonished if your book does not find its way into the valued literature of the world.
- Kumud
 
I've read so many hundreds of books classic or otherwise, and I see that yours is so unique that it will instigate a whole new movement, not only in literature, but in life!
Almost halfway through...So beautiful fun interesting captivating mysterious. So detailed yet inclusive & integrative, insights into pulsations betwixt regular mundane doings & subtle esoteric energies!
And so satisfyingly fat!
...True abundance! I'm sure a plenitude of others will feel the same.
- Rudra
 
Reading and very much enjoying...You are a great descriptive writer.
- Celest Brown
 
This book is so amazingly beautiful...I just started it last night and couldn't put it down, which totally surprised me because it's only really good thrillers that catch me that way.
You have so beautifully caught the exquisite crazyness of our lives I think, those of us who lived with him...totally ORDINARY, and totally totally mystical, and we take it all for granted somehow, or not for granted, but dissolving into the great something as an ordinary part of life, which most people don't experience in a imillion lifetimes.
Your book has shown me so much, what we carry and can open others to...
That is the first thing – know what you are carrying – it is HUGE.
...Anyway this book is incredible. It is just freaking incredible...
- Peggy Sands
 
I'm reading your book, an adventure unto itself...How to say: it is surprising, confronting, and delightful. SO straightforward about things hardly anyone talks about, let alone writes down in detailed descriptions...You also describe very well the places, situations, people, and the food too! As I read I grow to know all of those, and to love them..and the depth from which you come, whether shopping or meditating or tantra-ing, is marvellous..and above all inspiring..I'm printing a chapter, “Music,” to send to my 34-year-old daughter.
- Brahmani
 
I'm slowly making my way through Dancing Leaves, reading it with the care it deserves. I think about the depths of your explorations, reflect on my own dealings in these matters and make some notes. Your words are so descriptive, your exercises so necessary and your narrative so close to real human experiences – warts and all. It teases a part of my brain and my heart that has rarely been touched. I am thrilled by that and grateful too.
...Reading about your early years...such graphic images, teeth, filth, dryness, sex, loneliness, the positive poles of the breasts, hurt, glee, mischief, and luminosity of a soul on fire. Yes I'm still caressing the leaves of your life – holding them for a moment and scattering them as the fall from my hand...I want you to know I did listen. I learned too.
...Reading Dancing Leaves has left me spellbound with your ability to linger with a difficult atmosphere between you and Neil when you tried to speak but faced the experience alone...Maybe there is no other way. We have to face these small deaths alone. Things do pop because of it!
I read your experiences and I grow calm thinking I'm not alone dying when my partner is mute. Thank you for sharing your journey (in all the ways that you do) you will never know how much it means to me.
- Yuri Zelez
 
Best Tantra book ever. (I'm) much more interested in people and personal stories, and how to sometimes step out of them, than just theory and technique.
- Kerina Moorsteen
 
I finished your book. It was so honest and funny and sweet and really feel like I know you now. My favourite bit was when you were trying to do laughing meditation in the church, it had me in fits of laughter myself. ..
- Bria
 
I am so impressed in how you describe (in) words – they are so rich with liveliness and so visual – the reader is really pulled in, this is the type of writing I love. Your descriptions are really genius! It inspires me to write as well.
- Megan Pacetti
 
I agree with all your other fans. Your writing is really compelling, delightful to read, and so far very intriguing – and although I have no idea where the story goes....so far you've got my attention.
- Krishna Priya
 
It is pretty wild for a slightly stuffy Midwestern man to be with a wild witchy beauty like you – and love it! The book is absolutely mindblowingly engaging...Darling, the book is fascinating. You have really done something wonderful.
- Elizabeth Bordeaux
 
It's so rich and real...I don't ever feel preached at or being convinced...it's an extraordinary thing in a not-very-dramatic way and you get to watch it all unfold...If a cynical, mystically challenged person like me can take sweet refreshing draws from your book...the rest of the world should be swimming in it!
- Dalayna Williams
 
I joined your workshop yesterday at the Tantric Festival in Rotterdam ...It was sublime and had a deepness and intensity that is rare in the workshops in Holland that I have joined over the last years.
I am still a bit shaken at this moment – since I just found out you are the author of Love at Dancing Leaves...one of my 2 most cherished 'tantric' books – the other being Daniel Odier's story about his personal journey.
Therefore – a deep bow and thank you!...
- Rudolf Eeken
 
Engaging...I like the way you use words and phrasings. ..Craftsmanship...sweetness of the language, and when it demands you become devastatingly clinical. But the poetry of the prose dominates the cascading flow of the writing, and which is why I like it...I just felt I wished I were a tiny part of that journey.
- Samuel Dani
 
Just finished reading your book! Wow! What a book! I'm truly amazed, delighted, touched, and grateful.
When I first started it I whizzed through the first 50 pages or so totally enthralled with it and wondered, “Is she going to be able to keep this up for 500 pages?” And you did ! Amazing!
I most love your honesty and openness. It's very difficult for me to perceive a woman's world and I sense I got a good glimpse of it because of you. ..
- Ansula
 
Beautiful! Congratulations!
- Deva and Miten
 
The book is so magical I never want it to end. When does the sequel come out?
- Kerina Moorsteen
 
Love at at Dancing Leaves arrived in my life a few days ago...such a joy to peruse, feel, bathe in...thank you so much for your beauty, love and vitality...and also so sweet of you to acknowledge me in your book...I must say I found it really intriguing, full of zest and heart. I really enjoyed reading your Tantric cameos – such a sweetness and playfulness, lightness and innocence...
- Satya Puja
 
I feel like I am frolicking through a leafy forest...You write with transcendent clarity which seems to add an additional dimension – not the 3rd, perhaps, but maybe the 51/2th.
- Huck Akin
 
I started reading Love at Dancing Leaves late last night and only got as far as page 8, the reason being that I found myself re-reading nearly every sentence to savor every word and phrase.
I have bachelor degrees in Literature and History...I think, or like to think, I know good writing when I see it....Until last night, I considered you to be a somewhat talented, but more so deluded writer...I was expecting a sappy, sophomoric romance novel...I was Wrong...Have you read Black Lamb and Gray Falcon by Rebecca West or Bury Me Standing by a female author named Fonseca? Those two books left me in awe of the authors' range and talent, and if your book holds up for the next 497 pages, I'll be adding you to that list.
- Robert Banker
 
Like sipping nectar from acorn cups.
- Dalayna Williams
 
What a pleasure it is to read you: such beautiful writing, with lovely images, lyrical metaphors. The often-musical rhythm and flow spill over and through it. You write with so many felcitious phrases and words coined along the way!
You're definitely a wordsmith – a high compliment in my book.
- Nanette McGuinness, editor
 
More About the Moon
 
I'm just knocked sideways by the majestic language and clarity of More About the Moon and your poetry in general! Everything, from the feel of the book to its sylvan illustrations...and the magnificent words within, has warmed my heart.
- Simon Zonnenblick, editor, Caterpillar Poetry
 
...Alive with deep personal insights from someone who has experienced the world in ways which many of us can only dream of.
Glorious reflections of life shining like jewels in time.
Between two beautiful cover pictures Madhuri's book of poetry offers a vibrant glimpse of life reflected with focus and clarity....I really enjoyed the broad range of experience and vivid connection with each poem and could not put her book down.
Wonderful value.
- Keith Fielder
 
Madhuri's (book of) poetry arrived...what a wonderful gift! I had no idea she could write like that...so beautiful.
- Anupam
 
The book is absolutely magical. When I need a bit of magic, whimsy and fairy wings! - I get it out and treat myself, really like opening candy.
- Kerina Moorsteen
 
I bought 5 or 6 More About the Moon and gifted them to friends and family...You are so talented and it is inspiring to see your continued blossoming.
- Jim Chambers
 
Leave your mind at the door, with your shoes. Madhuri will take you on a journey that will leave you quiet, centered, and enriched. She takes a lifetime of searching, putting pen to paper in the most intense and enlightening moments, sharing those moments to the universe. For anyone who can tune in, and let them take them with her on her path..it's a profound and moving life;s journal...of one remarkable woman's spiritual footsteps.
- William Shepherd (Guru)
 
Your book is beautiful! It's like a song with so much feeling – like you're one with everything.
Thank you for the poem about our childhood.....
- Diana Drake Gall
 
Just about to read more of the poems before bed. They have a soothing effect. I love More About the Moon.
- Alison Darmbrough
 
Just reading the first poem in the book, written when she could not have been more than sixteen, I am delighted by the maturity of the voice – the haiku-like observation of the world around her....and then she takes us on a marvellous journey through her life, across continents and worlds, through love and pain and sorrow and joy, coming and going, learning, and leaving. And in that journey the voice matures, becomes more precise, and takes on that quality, which is perhaps beyond the ken of the very young, where “I” dissolves and the poet really does become the poetry:
 
And one is leaning out the window
over the light lichens crusted on the roof tiles
and the air is clean and cool as water,
and one is so gently full of joy.
 
(from leaning Out a Window in Tuscany, 2009.)
Read this small book. It is a true gift.
- Krishna Gopa
 
..Your book is an amazing treasure. I enjoy reading it and often hear your voice while reading in it...sometimes becoming part of the night-walk or moon-gazing party. Thanks..for this amazing present.
- Ramya
 
Your poems are magnificent...true and wise and innocent. Non-cliche purity...
- Prartho Sereno, Poet Laureate, Marin Co, Calif.
 
Madhuri, you are truly a gifted writer. Your words dance right into my heart...so rich, so sensual and poetic all at once.
- Shaeri Richards
 
Very deep and joyfull – rarely poetry can hold my attention but yours I read every word. Thank you.
- Kamala
 
Deeply felt.
Beautifully said.
A flowering is emerging...
Lovely.
- Devageet.
 
The other day I was reading my beloved Osho! who speaks about how history is really only half of the human story and that the feminine side is missing because the way we experience is so impossible to language. This is where your poetry pours into that empty book of who we are and how we are. I am reminded of the cathedral builders who for 4 or 5 generations cut stone, hauled rock, sanded stone, laid stone, but never saw the cathedral at all or their impact across centuries and cultures. This is you! Sure, you write for you but you write for generations down the line and you open more doors for expression to pour out of women, giving them permission!
- Prem Geet
 
I read More About the Moon voraciously cover to cover...It came at just the right moment...Your poems are magnificent..true and wise and innocent....None of that fancy mental footwork that abounds these days, but non-cliche purity, as clear and mysterious as the moon herself.
- Prartho Sereno
 
Madhuri is the most creative person I know. She is an excellent visual artist, producing watercolors, line drawings, and greeting cards. But, to me, she is above and beyond, a master of words, way beyond being a “word smith.” ...The words line up..they beguile me, invite me in. Many of her poems are spare, but they are larger on the inside...
She has a robust toolbox of (these) phrase turns, a cadence choreograophy, and emotional influxes..called on to sculpt each poem. This toolbox has been evident throughout her time line. The voice is comfortably consistent, but displayed perfectly for each poem, in each content. And there is the Moon in each one this time.
- Carl Gancher
 
...This poet sits at the hem of the Divine moon's illumined gown and takes notes...
Osho speaks about the wholeness of higher mathematics versus ordinary mathematics and says, “The same is true about all the higher values. A beautiful poem is not just the words that compose it; it is something more. Otherwise anybody who can put words together in a rhythmical form will become a Shakespeare, a Kalidas, a Milton, a Shelley. Then any linguist, grammarian will become a great poet. That does not happen. You may know the whole grammar of language, you may be acquainted with all the words of the language, still to be a poet is a totally different phenomenon. Poetry comes first, then come the words, not vice versa – it is not that you arrange the words and the poetry arises.
- Osho, I Am That, ch 9
 
I really like More About the Moon. To my eyes and ears you have an authentic voice.
- Satyam
 
...Tremendous appreciation for your imagery, ability to write rhythmically and the passion for life, love and getting to the bottom of it all that permeates your creativity.
- Amido Goodnight
 
Madhuri's primal poetry is one beautiful individualistic example of how poetry comes first, across a lifetime, as a way of relating to life, mining a relationship to Self...A mo-n-mad mystical trek over four decades...
Throughout recorded history, it seems that poets would have depleted the Moon's imagery by now, but Madhuri's latest moon-licious book proves that the Cool She is inexhaustible, rich beyond imagining, as many-faced as we are....Her amazing book is a rare moon-guided journey from a woman's waxing pubescence to the fullness of her own oceanic presence...the Night Pearl continues to reveal Herself in altogether new ways as long as there is a witnessing, pulsating mystic looking up... Madhuri reveals a rare gift, as if following the best poetic advice from..Ezra Pound who said simply, “Make it new.”
- Prem Geet
 
A Colourful Dessert of Flowers
 
 
(Re audio version:) First of all, there is your voice: it is mellow yet acrobatic in its flexibility. It is soothing and draws me in...I loved the crescendo section...And your rhythms:...prit'neer perfect...It was very musical in its rhythms, driven by your sweet facile voice.
And your thought stream: A thorough and insightful journey through sweet meadows, glades and ponds, bypassing negativity and linking up with the positive cosmic conscious mode..and there were many times I was jolted with the brilliance of the turns of phrase. I made pleased sounds: hoots, guffaws, sighs (with a shake of the head), and many repeats of the spoken word “AMAZING”.
- Carl Gancher
The Armageddon piece is brilliant....the main element was your performance.
Poetry become almost song...
- Nirguna
I listened to your beautiful voice as I tidied my office and did some filing.
Epic poems! ..You are amazing and after a while I became lulled into this place of deep peace with your words gently undulating in the background.
Beautiful and quirky and interesting.
- Dawn Golten
 
My lovely friend and teacher Madhuri who was my door to India and many other experiences has a new book! If you love soaking in mystical girly-womanly imagery...check it out!
Dalayna Williams
 
The truly original poet Madhuri creates a new form of extended poetry that invites you into her unconscious as a trembling participant of some foreign communion...(She) pours her existence into yours. Her words reshape you.
- Prem Geet
 
The book did leave me a bit speechless. Really wonderful. Out of any box I have ever seen.
- Kerina Moorsteen
 
Truly a wonderful poem, filled me with delight!
- Daniela Leardini
 
 
 
 
 
The Poona Poems
 
Wise, witty and honest poems about love, attachment, and detachment for other women to go “Ah ha!” to and curious men to wonder at...and all the others including the clear, clear ones after your op. It's been a privilege to read them.
- Satyam Makoieva
 
It REALLY is a very valuable historical snapshot of soul in time....

<p>Baby boomers have relied primarily on wisdom to pave their way to success. Education, knowledge, investment strategies, 401ks and carefully contrived career paths were expected to lead to success in one’s golden years. </p>
<p>Seeing the overall failure of that formulaic approach to life, younger generations today have relied on passion as the guiding principle for their version of success.</p>
<p>The concept of “success” has transformed from a focus on financial gain to a focus on living a more extraordinary life, one that benefits humanity. We want to make the world a better, more peaceful place. We want to be “changemakers” and “social entrepreneurs."" Security and stability are a lot less compelling than before. There’s more out there and we know it. </p>
<p><strong>In short, we must foster wisdom, passion and collaboration if we truly want to live an extraordinary life and make a positive impact. </strong></p>
<p><strong>In <em>Wisdom Meets Passion</em> you’ll find some of these principles:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How can I “make a difference” in the world today?</li>
<li>Where do I find security?</li>
<li>Is a college degree necessary for success today?</li>
<li>How do I find – or create – work that matters?</li>
<li>Can I be a social entrepreneur and do good while doing well?</li>
<li>Why am I here?</li>
<li>What if I’m ready for retirement and still haven’t lived my dream – is it too late?</li>

<p>Our goal is to get this book and medallion into your hands.  We want you be able to inspire those in your center of influence – children, spouses, co-workers and those you meet on the street.  </p>

<p>The medallion was designed as a collaboration between Jared Angaza and Hannah Woodard at KEZA, an ethical fashion label owned by Jared that operates in East Africa.

<p>The necklace itself is made from a durable, black nylon cord, randomly knotted and looped around itself, as a representation of humanity. The cord loops through the center of the Ubuntu Medallion, representing the core of our ethos as a united society.</p>
<p>The necklace was assembled by Nepali refugees through Hope Rise, a Nashville, TN based charity assisting refugees integrating into Nashville. Every medallion sold affords them more income, dignity and options.</p>
<p>You can wear it on your neck, carry it in your pocket, pay it forward or hang it from your rearview mirror. Go wild with it. </p>

</div></div>","I’m Dan Miller, life coach and the author of 48 Days to the Work You Love, No More Dreaded Mondays and The Rudder of the Day. My passion is helping people find – or create – work that is meaningful, fulfilling and profitable.
My publisher, Thomas Nelson, is releasing the trade paperback version of Wisdom Meets Passion on August 28th, but we wanted to give you an opportunity to collaborate with us to spread this powerful message. We have produced a Special Edition Hardback Version of Wisdom meets Passion that won't be sold in stores. We're making it available to you first, here on Indiegogo.
This project is about the power of collaboration. I worked with my son Jared Angaza to write Wisdom Meets Passion - A book that talks about joining generations and philosophies. We also created a medallion that captures the essence of the book. You can wear it around your neck or put it in your pocket as a daily reminder to connect.

What is Wisdom Meets Passion About?
Wisdom meets Passion isn’t a movement or a new philosophy. It’s a reminder. A wakeup call. An outline to engage us in living a more extraordinary life. To help us become the very best of who we are. 
To thrive.
We’ve got a plan that involves collaborating with you.
Ubuntu
There’s an old African philosophy that encapsulates the concept of collaborative living.
It’s called Ubuntu.
It’s the belief that we are all interconnected.
No matter our race, culture, creed or socioeconomic status.
My humanity is tied to yours.
We are each a collective of our personal relationships and experiences.
We’ve created a special medallion as a reminder of this.

<p>Refund</p>
<p>It's been almost three years since the campaign closed on this and every step since then has been past the deadline and barely finished.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Otis G. Sanders, I'm a professional photographer, I'm here on IndieGoGo to raise funds to finish my book project entitled: ""Always &amp; ForEver, Love"" subtitled: ""Success Stories of Marriages 20 + Years Strong""</p>
<p>This book project is a celebration of the institution of  traditional marriage. With approx. 50% of all marriages in America ending in divorce there is a desperate need to bring to light the other 50% of marriages that survive where the couples are happy and in love after 20 years or more of marriage. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>""Always&amp;ForEver, Love""  will consist of approx. 50 married couples of different Ethnic groups that have been married not less than 20 years. Different Ethnic groups will be used to demonstrate that there is no difference between the races when it comes to the institution of marriage.  What makes a marriage work for an African American couple is the same for an  Anglo, Hispanic, Bi-racial, or Asian couple.   The selected couples will be interviewed and photographed, each couple will have 2 pages in the book, one page will be highlights of what they have done and continue to do to make their marriage work, and the opposite page will be a full page photograph of the couple.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This book, ""Always &amp; ForEver, Love"" can be used as a reference book for couples that are looking to get married, have a better marriage, already married and want their marriage to last through the good and bad times.  Reading the stories of successful marriages from 20 years to 73 years are examples of what is possible and most couples reading these couples stories will find similarities that are not unlike their own circumstances, thereby giving them them fortitude to forge ahead to build a long standing, successful, happy, marriage til death due they part.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If this campaign falls short of desired funding this book project will still happen as I have used personal funds for all travel, hotels, meals, promotions, and transportation to photograph and interview the couples.  The publication date will be changed as it will take a while long to raise the required funds for printing.<br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
My name is Otis G. Sanders, I'm a professional photographer, I'm here on IndieGoGo to raise funds to finish my book project entitled: ""Always & ForEver, Love"" subtitled: ""Success Stories of Marriages 20 + Years Strong""
This book project is a celebration of the institution of  traditional marriage. With approx. 50% of all marriages in America ending in divorce there is a desperate need to bring to light the other 50% of marriages that survive where the couples are happy and in love after 20 years or more of marriage. 

""Always&ForEver, Love""  will consist of approx. 50 married couples of different Ethnic groups that have been married not less than 20 years. Different Ethnic groups will be used to demonstrate that there is no difference between the races when it comes to the institution of marriage.  What makes a marriage work for an African American couple is the same for an  Anglo, Hispanic, Bi-racial, or Asian couple.   The selected couples will be interviewed and photographed, each couple will have 2 pages in the book, one page will be highlights of what they have done and continue to do to make their marriage work, and the opposite page will be a full page photograph of the couple.


The Impact
This book, ""Always & ForEver, Love"" can be used as a reference book for couples that are looking to get married, have a better marriage, already married and want their marriage to last through the good and bad times.  Reading the stories of successful marriages from 20 years to 73 years are examples of what is possible and most couples reading these couples stories will find similarities that are not unlike their own circumstances, thereby giving them them fortitude to forge ahead to build a long standing, successful, happy, marriage til death due they part.

If this campaign falls short of desired funding this book project will still happen as I have used personal funds for all travel, hotels, meals, promotions, and transportation to photograph and interview the couples.  The publication date will be changed as it will take a while long to raise the required funds for printing.

<p>The basic idea is about a man who has allowed life to stop... Years have become monotony and he doesn't really care. Fate though, has a way of setting things straight, allowing eyes to be opened, egos to be bruised and wrongs to be righted. I think it's a funny, exciting, true, tragic, redemptive story of a man and a long overdue journey.</p>
<h2>
<br/>My Story (About the Author)</h2>
<div>My name is Myles Carter and I am a writer. I do this as a hobby right now because I'm new, I've no experience and I can't eat paper. I need to make a living so I work throughout the day and try to produce 600-1000 words at night in order to keep writing, keep improving and keep attempting to get my work out there.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The idea was that I'd work hard on a book, to send it to a publisher. Once they read it, see if it's the kind of thing that they want to sell to the masses, they may buy it. If they buy it, I would get a cheque and some royalties per book sold. This would be a process that could take years and lots of wasted money and time trying to get agents and editors and publishers to like something that I like, and that I want the world to have a chance to look at. I'd get a small percentage of the books sales and people who buy it would pay too much for an item I just want to put food in my stomach and a roof over my head.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<p>Over the last 2 months though, I've begun to think about the age we live in and the effect that being so connected with other people in an digital world can mean. An idea, while not new, came to me from many different channels. It was the idea that I have a product, and a medium to get that out there. It's called the internet and my words can make their way to others pretty easy. I'll pitch it to the world, see if they like a taste and if they do, they'll get to be part of publishing a book.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>After it's finished, end of May, I'm going to podcast chapter by chapter, to allow people a taste of the book. Something they can listen to on the way to work, something they can appreciate. That'll be free, that's my gift to the world and anyone who cares. Then I'll sell the book online, and in print (through the internet) for a price that allows people to read it and take it in. Nothing that will break the bank and no specially costs to sell it to Americans or Canadians or Europeans, one flat price for everyone.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So, I'm going to work in this way, if enough people who like to read want to support me, I'll give them something to read. It'll be shorter, somewhere around 200 - 250 pages, the kind of thing you'd be able to get immersed in on a flight, finish on the beach after two days, or sit down on a rainy morning and finish before bed if all you want to do is read and drink tea.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>$7500.00 - It's an arbitrary number, but what it really amounts to is giving me the ability to live, pay rent, operate my lights, get any supplies, buy an ISBN number so I can walk up to apple or amazon and have my book published through their shops. It'll allow me to buy a printer and print the book as is needed. It'll give me levity to bind copies for donors or for bookshops. It'll make sure I can devote days, not hours to a work of love. It'll mean that I scrimp and save, the same as I do now, but provide a product... a piece of art, if you may, to the world.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The perks for donations are always worth greater than their value in donation... at least I believe so. If they aren't, contact me I'd be happy to arrange something. However, each donation level will receive their items services plus those of all levels below (paperbacks are limited to the numer listed on your level).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>$ 1.00 - Random fact (or two)</p>
<p>$ 5.00 - E-Copy of the book (Kindle/iBooks) + personally drawn thank you note</p>
<p>$ 10.00 - Shout out on podcast</p>
<p>$ 25.00 - Bound chapter (your choice) signed</p>
<p>$ 50.00 - Copy of book (hardcover), signed</p>

</p>
<p>So no matter the distance, the darkness, the cold or the terrain, industry's hardest workers sometimes need help.  And there is a cadre of clinicians and first responders who provide that care.  They are often hampered by isolation and weather and limited equipment.  Sometimes, they are simply overwhelmed by volume as the population of a town explodes or a project gets expanded.
</p>
<p>I want to find out how it's done.  What works and what doesn't?  Who are the people that choose to practice in such extreme environments and what are their stories?  What is it like from the patient's perspective?
</p>
<p>Often, half the challenge is in getting there, or conversely, getting out.  So, to understand it, I'm hitting the road.  A 12,000+ mile roadtrip from Maine to northern Labrador and Quebec, back down to the midwestern US, west to Washington, south to California, east to Texas and northeast to West Virginia.  Alone.
</p>
<p>I'll be visiting an arctic hydroelectric plant under construction, a 1970s era self contained and enclosed iron mining town in Quebec, the booming population around ""fracking"" in the Dakotas, loggers in the Northwest, gold miners returning to California, and itinerant agriculture workers along the Mexican and Canadian borders.  In New Mexico, I'll visit the vestiges of the space race and learn about the highest altitude medicine there is, then a 4-hour drive later, plunge half a mile into the earth at a subterranean geological repository for nuclear waste.  I'll visit an offshore oil rig and a tanker in the gulf of Mexico and find out what the aftermath of the coal mine disaster in West Virginia has meant to primary care providers there.  I'll island hop along the coast of Maine and find out how practitioners there survive both the isolation of winter and the overcrowding of summer.
</p>
<p>I'll be driving, camping and writing a series of articles, alone.  All I need is gas in the tank, food in my belly and time.  Time to hear the stories these folks want to tell.  Your donation will go directly to those things.  And studded snow tires.

<p>Robin Behl</p></span></div>","From the subarctic tundra of northern Labrador, to the scorching heat and searing sun of Bisbee, Arizona, men and women toil every day to extract minerals and drill for oil and harness the power of water and wind, undeterred by the elements.  Copper and gold and iron mines.  Offshore and tar sand and hydraulic fractured oil production.  Hydroelectric plants, mountaintop weather stations and space shuttle operations.  Laborers with strong hands and stronger backs rake blueberries and pick oranges and shake pecans.  All of these jobs come with an inherent amount of risk and danger.  And they're all done by humans.  No matter the advances in technology, a person has to drive the truck or change the fitting or de-ice the equiment.  And humans get hurt.  They get sick.  Som of them have babies and some of the have heart attacks.

So no matter the distance, the darkness, the cold or the terrain, industry's hardest workers sometimes need help.  And there is a cadre of clinicians and first responders who provide that care.  They are often hampered by isolation and weather and limited equipment.  Sometimes, they are simply overwhelmed by volume as the population of a town explodes or a project gets expanded.

I want to find out how it's done.  What works and what doesn't?  Who are the people that choose to practice in such extreme environments and what are their stories?  What is it like from the patient's perspective?

Often, half the challenge is in getting there, or conversely, getting out.  So, to understand it, I'm hitting the road.  A 12,000+ mile roadtrip from Maine to northern Labrador and Quebec, back down to the midwestern US, west to Washington, south to California, east to Texas and northeast to West Virginia.  Alone.

I'll be visiting an arctic hydroelectric plant under construction, a 1970s era self contained and enclosed iron mining town in Quebec, the booming population around ""fracking"" in the Dakotas, loggers in the Northwest, gold miners returning to California, and itinerant agriculture workers along the Mexican and Canadian borders.  In New Mexico, I'll visit the vestiges of the space race and learn about the highest altitude medicine there is, then a 4-hour drive later, plunge half a mile into the earth at a subterranean geological repository for nuclear waste.  I'll visit an offshore oil rig and a tanker in the gulf of Mexico and find out what the aftermath of the coal mine disaster in West Virginia has meant to primary care providers there.  I'll island hop along the coast of Maine and find out how practitioners there survive both the isolation of winter and the overcrowding of summer.

I'll be driving, camping and writing a series of articles, alone.  All I need is gas in the tank, food in my belly and time.  Time to hear the stories these folks want to tell.  Your donation will go directly to those things.  And studded snow tires.

In return, you can travel with me through my blog and webcam, the ""shotgun cam"" mounted in the front passenger seat.  For anyone contributing $1,000 or more, I'll hand-pick some carved or woven artwork from each of the Native American or First Nation (Canada) communities I visit and send them to you.  If you contribute $100 or more, you'll get advertising space on my blog and on the ""shotgun cam.""

<p><br/>The first one will be named <strong>""The Apple Tree,""</strong> which tells the story of Little Shaima, a young girl who learns the virtues of planting a fruit tree with her dad. When this fruit tree starts to bear fruit, Little Shaima learns the valuable lesson of generosity and giving charity. The story is based on the Hadith:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><br/><em>""When a Muslim plants a tree, whatever is eaten from it is charity from him and whatever is stolen is charity and whatever is subtracted from it is charity"" (Sahih Muslim).</em></p>
<p><br/>The author, resident of Southern California, hopes that this story and the series as a whole will teach Muslim as well as non-Muslim children not only the different Hadiths that exist, but also the numerous life lessons that come from learning them.</p>

<p>Mariam is striving to make this project one with a strong sense of <strong>quality!</strong> She wants to go above and beyond when it comes to the publishing of this book because she feels there is a lack of quality when it comes to Islamic books.

<p><span> </span></p></span></div>","What is Miracle e-zine?
 
Miracle e-zine is an online literary and artistic magazine featuring writers from various countries, walks of life and levels of writing experience, all united by a love for creative writing.  Founded in June 2012, we have published five issues thus far and we are currently working on our sixth issue.
 
Anyone can submit writing or art to Miracle e-zine as it is a publication that welcomes both emerging and established writers.  In this way, the magazine helps young or reluctant writers gain experience and share their writing with others.  It is difficult to be published and this magazine is a great first step.  This publication is about writing for pleasure as much as showcasing quality writing.  Hundreds of stories, ideas and thoughts from a diversity of individuals combine to form Miracle e-zine.  Whether you are an amateur or a professional, as long as you are a writer, your talent is welcome here.
 
Miracle e-zine features an abundance of genres; poetry, short stories, prose, non-fiction, book reviews, film reviews, interviews, photography, visual art and articles.  It is international and bimonthly, with each issue focused on a different theme, like inspiration.  A different author is featured every month, as well as a different writing website.  We also welcome advertisers.
 
Each issue also includes fun writing tasks for readers to complete.  If you send in your response to the task you could win prizes and a special feature in the next issue of Miracle e-zine.  Miracle e-zine also features a writing workshop, help column and theme column.  
 
The writing workshop offers ideas to improve one’s writing.  In Issue 5 of Miracle e-zine, the writing workshop column featured Marie Lightman, who offered interesting writing prompts for those with writer’s block.
 
Our help column is written by Troy Cabadia and gives writers helpful tips and information about aspects of the writing world.  In Issue 5, Cabadia explored the world of digital publishing and the pros and cons of E-books, making this aspect of literature more straightforward and less intimidating to readers.
 
Finally, the theme column is written by R.G. Summers and consists of an article based on the theme of the issue, often in the form of a short story.  In Issue 5, she wrote a short story about Inspiration, which provided the lesson that even the smallest, most fleeting thoughts can be inspiration for creative writing.
 
Mission
 
Our main goal is to publish new and young writers or introverted writers that are hesitant to share their work.  We aim to feature a variety of writers from all around the world, publishing both quality literary work and new, young and emerging writers.  Miracle e-zine collects intelligent, creative writing from writers with varying levels of skill and experience.
 
Miracle's main aim is to bring all forms of art under one roof for which it is on and off working on many projects, for example, the Young People Project, whose aim is to bring creative young people from around the world together to create something different.
 
Contributors
 
Our editor is Guntaj Arora.  We feature different writers each issue.  So far we have featured Jane Struthers, Anne Caldwell, Ann Wilson, Cath Drake, Wes Brown, Harry Giles, Leeroah Hursky, Kayo Chingonyi and Akash KJ.
 
Each issue contains writing from around fifty different writers.  We have a wide variety of contributors from many different countries and walks of life.  Whether you write only as a hobby and you have never shown your writing to anyone, or you have been published hundreds of times, Miracle e-zine welcomes your talents. We look for all types of writing and art works.
 
Miracle Bond
 
Miracle Bond is an online, interactive community of emerging writers dedicated to improving their writing, associated with Miracle e-zine.  It is completely free to join and since it is an online group it is open to writers from all countries.  
 
The group participates in various activities and interactive sessions in which they discuss and share their work.  Miracle Bond is tailored to writers who want inspiration, advice or feedback on their work.  Every week there are new activities and writers post their work so that the other group members can provide suggestions and constructive criticism.  
 
To join you must fill out an online registration form on the Miracle e-zine website and the group will consider you for membership.  Members are selected based on their desire to develop and improve their writing.
 
How will we use the funding?
 
Our Kickstarter funding will be used to fund the first print edition of Miracle e-zine.  We are a digital magazine and we would like expand our readership by creating print issues as well as digital issues.  Our print edition will come out in August and it will be sold online and at many bookstores around the world. Also, this funding will be used for the Young People Project. Miracle's main goal has always been to promote young people, and these funds will be used in bringing about many creative activities throughout the year!
 
Submissions
 
We are always looking for submissions for our upcoming issues.  If you would like to submit some poetry, short fiction, non-fiction, flash fiction, book reviews, blog posts or art work, feel free to submit your work to Miracle e-zine through our website (http://miracleezine.wix.com/miracle-e-zine) or our email address:miracle.ezine@yahoo.com and make sure that you include a short biography in the third person.  Our editors will try to respond to your submissions within 2-3 weeks and we will let you know whether your work is accepted.
 
There is no preferred genre of writing.  You will find that we welcome most genres.  Works in progress and simultaneous submissions are welcome but they must be marked as such.  
 
Poetry: no more than 3-6 poems
Short stories: limit of 2, no more than 3500 words
 
Make sure that you paste your submission into the email or attach it as a .doc file.
 

 
Rewards
 
If you contribute to our project, there are many wonderful awards available to you.  We are giving away free copies and subscriptions to the digital and print editions of Miracle e-zine.  
 
At the $10 or more level you will be given a membership to Miracle Bond, a special and interactive writing group.  Also available are copies of the anthology for the 2013 Poetry Competition and copies of the first print issue personally autographed by our editor, Guntaj Arora.  Guntaj Arora will also be writing handwritten Thank-You notes to contributors of $200 or more.  Other rewards include a special framed poster by the Miracle e-zine team.  
 
The reward for contributing $500 or more is that you will be able to work with Miracle e-zine on its first print issue.  
 
And finally, if you are the generous being that contributes $600 or more, you will be the featured writer, artist or photographer for the next issue of Miracle e-zine.  If you are an advertiser, we will give you a full-page ad in our magazine.

<h3></h3>
<p>Hello! I’m Michael Harris, Founder of <b>ProSeed Books</b>. I am a working professional, artist, musician &amp; writer. Giving back to my community has always been important to me. I am driven to connect with my environment, with the people in my life and those I have yet to meet.  I have always found that artistic expression is one of the most powerful ways to do this; be it with a song, a book, a painting, photography or dance. Communicating the beauty of our human condition is critical and what I am inspired to do.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>“A Picture Is Worth...”</b> does this and much more. As a true collaborative multimedia book, it not only brings together the best of photography, music and technology, but it changes what a book can do. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/181073/files/20131106193326-spread6_inlayout.jpg?1383795206"" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">At the start, ten photographers were asked to submit a series of photos that work loosely to convey a story. These stunning photos were then handed out to ten Singer/Songwriters who were asked to compose and record an original song based on the inspiration gleaned from the photos they received. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/181080/files/20131106193725-spread2_inlayout.jpg?1383795445"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>What makes <b>""A Picture is Worth...""</b> stand apart? Each artist has an individual QR code in the book that allows the reader to use their smart phone or tablet to scan the codes to hear the music that goes with each series of photos--and watch the individual artists discuss their part in the book’s creation. </p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/F9MOQlUNAIE?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>“A Picture Is Worth...”</b> will also make a difference in the lives of young children in communities in need.  A portion of each book sold will be donated to the Los Angeles branch of <b>Reach Out And Read </b>, a national non-profit children’s literacy organization, that puts books into the hands of parents and young children to develop a culture of reading within the family. So your contribution aids in that endeavor. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/181078/files/20131106193449-spread3_inlayout.jpg?1383795289"" src="""" style=""""/><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">What your contribution goes to:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Your contribution goes to the final production and printing of the limited-edition book and the distribution of the gifts for the various tiers. A portion of each book sold from the ‘Giving Tree’ tier will go to Reach Out And Read. Any remaining funds will be used to seed the next ProSeed Book project. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Because this is a special limited-edition book, we are only printing a few hundred which we hope to pre-sell during the campaign, allowing us to hit our donation goal to Reach Out And Read. If we do not make our overall campaign goal, books will still be printed and rewards distributed, but the number of books and the amount we can donate will of course be effected. </p>
<p><b>As thanks for your kindness!</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>With attention to detail and quality we have put together a selection of gifts at various contribution tiers. </p>

<p><br/></p></span></div>","Hello! I’m Michael Harris, Founder of ProSeed Books. I am a working professional, artist, musician & writer. Giving back to my community has always been important to me. I am driven to connect with my environment, with the people in my life and those I have yet to meet.  I have always found that artistic expression is one of the most powerful ways to do this; be it with a song, a book, a painting, photography or dance. Communicating the beauty of our human condition is critical and what I am inspired to do.


“A Picture Is Worth...” does this and much more. As a true collaborative multimedia book, it not only brings together the best of photography, music and technology, but it changes what a book can do. 


At the start, ten photographers were asked to submit a series of photos that work loosely to convey a story. These stunning photos were then handed out to ten Singer/Songwriters who were asked to compose and record an original song based on the inspiration gleaned from the photos they received. 








What makes ""A Picture is Worth..."" stand apart? Each artist has an individual QR code in the book that allows the reader to use their smart phone or tablet to scan the codes to hear the music that goes with each series of photos--and watch the individual artists discuss their part in the book’s creation. 



“A Picture Is Worth...” will also make a difference in the lives of young children in communities in need.  A portion of each book sold will be donated to the Los Angeles branch of Reach Out And Read , a national non-profit children’s literacy organization, that puts books into the hands of parents and young children to develop a culture of reading within the family. So your contribution aids in that endeavor. 


What your contribution goes to:



Your contribution goes to the final production and printing of the limited-edition book and the distribution of the gifts for the various tiers. A portion of each book sold from the ‘Giving Tree’ tier will go to Reach Out And Read. Any remaining funds will be used to seed the next ProSeed Book project. 


Because this is a special limited-edition book, we are only printing a few hundred which we hope to pre-sell during the campaign, allowing us to hit our donation goal to Reach Out And Read. If we do not make our overall campaign goal, books will still be printed and rewards distributed, but the number of books and the amount we can donate will of course be effected. 
As thanks for your kindness!


With attention to detail and quality we have put together a selection of gifts at various contribution tiers. 


A bookmark of Cherry wood, hand branded with the ProSeed Books’ pine cone logo.



A dark gray, soft cotton t-shirt, silk screened by hand with the ProSeed Books logo and slogan. 




A beautiful print of one of the photographs from the book signed by the photographer.
A limited-edition copy of “A Picture Is Worth...”, numbered, with an embossed seal and signed by several of the artists.
Your name in the book as a special patron to this project.

1) It’s Levantine Fantasy
Israel is a beautiful and fascinating place. Merely looking out of a car window fills you with four thousand years of wonder, magic, and horror. It is a country of dark contradictions – a land of ancient history that hails to times before the flood, and an all-too-fragile modern civilization.

Besides, why should Greeks and Vikings have all the fun? The Gods and Monsters of the Old Levant want to be heard too...
You can read one such story here.
2) It’s Real Fantasy
Yes, it’s an oxymoron. Allow me to explain. This is more than just a fantasy story cycle one writes as he sits in front of the computer, sipping tea and listening to bands you’ve probably never heard of. This is a nice and accurate guide. These stories are not made up, they are told by the land. I am merely translating them into words and pictures.

</p><p><b>“The peculiar grace
of a shaker chair is due to the fact that it was made by someone capable of
believing that an angel might come and sit on it.” – Thomas Merton, Trappist
Monk and Philosopher</b></p>
<p>I am a mortgage broker. 
I rent money. I don’t build
enduring, simply elegant furniture.  But
the sentiment behind this Thomas Merton quote has always resonated deeply with
my belief system.  What if my next client
actually was an angel?  A celestial
spirit sent down from above?  </p>
<p>What would I do differently than I
have done before?  </p>
<p>What would I need to learn in order to
be worthy of the business?</p>
<p>What skills would I need to improve in
order to give advice better than ever before?</p>
<p>What resources would I need to gather?</p>
<p>And who is to say that my next client
is not, indeed, an angel?</p>
<p>These are the questions that keep me up at night; how can I
achieve constant, never-ending improvement in how I serve my clients?</p>
<p><b>What does that have to do with this book?<span>  </span></b></p>
<p>In 2008 our industry collapsed and took the economy of the entire
country, maybe even the world, with it.  The
collapse of the industry came about, in my opinion, because of a convergence of
three trends:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Investment banks, with loosened regulatory
guidelines, discovered that they could create highly profitable, exotic loan
products that sold very well.</p></li>
<li><p>Mortgage originators (those who worked for
brokers or banks) found they could make a great deal more money on the exotic
products than on conventional products and went crazy selling them.</p></li>
<li><p>Potential homebuyers who were not able to buy
homes with conventional financing jumped on the opportunities afforded by the
exotic products, sometimes having been duped into accepting onerous terms, and
sometimes knowingly.</p></li>
</ul><p><i>This was our fault as
an industry; we are responsible to see that it doesn’t happen again</i></p>
<p>I believe that the primary reason we as an industry were
able to sell such toxic products and cause the Great Recession was because many
originators (not all) were completely disconnected from their clients, and many
clients (not all) were so uninformed they had no chance to protect themselves.</p>
<p>As I sat thinking in 2008 how we could change the industry
so that such a debacle never happened again, I knew that I could not change the
industry.  There has been a valiant
attempt through the new regulation, but the best they can hope for is to
control the bad players through strict oversight and clean up messes through
enforcement.  They will always be
battling corruption and greed.</p>
<p>I can, however, educate the consumer.  That is the purpose of <i>The Loan Guide: How to Get the Best Possible Mortgage</i>.  </p>
<p><b>Why Educating the Consumer Matters</b></p>
<p>If you, the consumer, are educated about all the ins and
outs of the mortgage you are considering, you will know when your mortgage
advisor is not acting in your best interest. 
You will be able to make informed, confident decisions, and you will get
the best possible mortgage.</p>
<p>This is just a book, but the message, the information and
the guidance in the book are important. 
The book empowers consumers to manage the mortgage process by giving
them a peak behind the industry curtain, guidance as to whether they should or
should not proceed with their current plans, and financial tools to back up
their decisions with solid data.</p>
<p><i>There has been no
other book on mortgages written since the collapse of the business</i></p>
<p>Everything about mortgage lending has changed since 2008,
but there hasn’t been a book written for the consumer since before the
collapse.  There simply is no unbiased
source of information for the consumer today. 
<i>The Loan Guide</i> is badly
needed.</p>
<p><i>The book is done.  Your contributions will be used to promote
this important message</i></p>
<p>The book is written, edited by a team of writers and
mortgage professionals, laid out, and ready to publish.  But in order for this message and these tools
to reach as many people as possible, a robust promotional campaign has to be
launched.</p>
<p><b>What we need and how it will be used</b></p>
<p>The funds raised by this campaign will be used for the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create a professional book cover design.</p></li>
<li><p>Flesh out the website <a href=""http://www.loanguide.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.loanguide.com</a> to sell the books and
provide easy access to the Excel-based tools which are used throughout the
book.</p></li>
<li><p>Host a book launch event for influential
industry leaders who will help market the book.</p></li>
<li><p>Offer the tools in the book through consumer
counseling agencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Create educational events with real estate
agents to deliver the message and promote the book.</p></li>
<li><p>Reach out to local corporations to deliver the
message as an employee benefit.</p></li>
<li><p>Distribute the book through financial planners
and their professional organizations.</p></li>
<li><p>Advertise on Facebook and Linkedin to create a
viral sales channel</p></li>
<li><p>Order the first 500 copies to use for
promotional meetings</p></li>
</ul><p>To accomplish all of this will take a minimum of $18,500. If we get to $27,300, we’ll also be able to
create a couple of professional-quality promotional videos, have an e-book
version layout created professionally, and create a series of lectures that can
be used to educate consumers to make informed, confident decisions about buying
their next home.</p>
<p>I’ve created some nifty perks as a gift of gratitude for
your support.  Especially if your
business is helping families with their real estate or financing needs, you’ll
find perks that can bring a great deal of value to your clients and help you
build your business at the same time. 
I’m very grateful for your support, and I want to show it.</p>
<p>The important message in The Loan Guide will be worthless if
it is not read.  Your contribution will
not only help me as an author, but will help the thousands of folks who need
this book today.  You will be helping to
educate consumers so that they can help themselves by making informed,
confident decisions about the largest debt they’ll ever have.</p>
<p>Finally, I realize not everyone can contribute and some of
the perks won’t be meaningful to everyone. 
Whatever amount you can contribute is appreciated, and even if you can’t
contribute you can provide very valuable support by passing this campaign on to
anyone who is looking for a mortgage or who works with homeowners in any
capacity.  </p>
<p>Real estate agents, financial advisors, asset managers,
credit counselors, accountants, and others can use this book to help educate
their clients and the perks I’ve offered can help them build their
business.  Please pass this on to those
you know.</p>

country, maybe even the world, with it.  The
collapse of the industry came about, in my opinion, because of a convergence of
three trends:

Investment banks, with loosened regulatory
guidelines, discovered that they could create highly profitable, exotic loan
products that sold very well.
Mortgage originators (those who worked for
brokers or banks) found they could make a great deal more money on the exotic
products than on conventional products and went crazy selling them.
Potential homebuyers who were not able to buy
homes with conventional financing jumped on the opportunities afforded by the
exotic products, sometimes having been duped into accepting onerous terms, and
sometimes knowingly.
This was our fault as
an industry; we are responsible to see that it doesn’t happen again
I believe that the primary reason we as an industry were
able to sell such toxic products and cause the Great Recession was because many
originators (not all) were completely disconnected from their clients, and many
clients (not all) were so uninformed they had no chance to protect themselves.
As I sat thinking in 2008 how we could change the industry
so that such a debacle never happened again, I knew that I could not change the
industry.  There has been a valiant
attempt through the new regulation, but the best they can hope for is to
control the bad players through strict oversight and clean up messes through
enforcement.  They will always be
battling corruption and greed.
I can, however, educate the consumer.  That is the purpose of The Loan Guide: How to Get the Best Possible Mortgage.  
Why Educating the Consumer Matters
If you, the consumer, are educated about all the ins and
outs of the mortgage you are considering, you will know when your mortgage
advisor is not acting in your best interest. 
You will be able to make informed, confident decisions, and you will get
the best possible mortgage.
This is just a book, but the message, the information and
the guidance in the book are important. 
The book empowers consumers to manage the mortgage process by giving
them a peak behind the industry curtain, guidance as to whether they should or
should not proceed with their current plans, and financial tools to back up
their decisions with solid data.
There has been no
other book on mortgages written since the collapse of the business
Everything about mortgage lending has changed since 2008,
but there hasn’t been a book written for the consumer since before the
collapse.  There simply is no unbiased
source of information for the consumer today. 
The Loan Guide is badly
needed.
The book is done.  Your contributions will be used to promote
this important message
The book is written, edited by a team of writers and
mortgage professionals, laid out, and ready to publish.  But in order for this message and these tools
to reach as many people as possible, a robust promotional campaign has to be
launched.
What we need and how it will be used
The funds raised by this campaign will be used for the
following:

Create a professional book cover design.
Flesh out the website www.loanguide.com to sell the books and
provide easy access to the Excel-based tools which are used throughout the
book.
Host a book launch event for influential
industry leaders who will help market the book.
Offer the tools in the book through consumer
counseling agencies.
Create educational events with real estate
agents to deliver the message and promote the book.
Reach out to local corporations to deliver the
message as an employee benefit.
Distribute the book through financial planners
and their professional organizations.
Advertise on Facebook and Linkedin to create a
viral sales channel
Order the first 500 copies to use for
promotional meetings
To accomplish all of this will take a minimum of $18,500. If we get to $27,300, we’ll also be able to
create a couple of professional-quality promotional videos, have an e-book
version layout created professionally, and create a series of lectures that can
be used to educate consumers to make informed, confident decisions about buying
their next home.
I’ve created some nifty perks as a gift of gratitude for
your support.  Especially if your
business is helping families with their real estate or financing needs, you’ll
find perks that can bring a great deal of value to your clients and help you
build your business at the same time. 
I’m very grateful for your support, and I want to show it.
The important message in The Loan Guide will be worthless if
it is not read.  Your contribution will
not only help me as an author, but will help the thousands of folks who need
this book today.  You will be helping to
educate consumers so that they can help themselves by making informed,
confident decisions about the largest debt they’ll ever have.
Finally, I realize not everyone can contribute and some of
the perks won’t be meaningful to everyone. 
Whatever amount you can contribute is appreciated, and even if you can’t
contribute you can provide very valuable support by passing this campaign on to
anyone who is looking for a mortgage or who works with homeowners in any
capacity.  
Real estate agents, financial advisors, asset managers,
credit counselors, accountants, and others can use this book to help educate
their clients and the perks I’ve offered can help them build their
business.  Please pass this on to those
you know.
Thank you for your support!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<h3>V<strong>oices of Hellenism literary journal is a San Francisco Bay Area-based nonprofit Hellenic literary journal and a product of the Voices of Hellenism Literary Society, a global Hellenic organization that strives to promote Modern Greek Literature, idiosyncratic community building through writing, and historical preservation through literature and the written word. The journal began as a dream and was started by Annamarie Buonocore in 2011. The publication is annual and will come out in December of each year. Submissions are accepted on a rolling basis and peer reviewed by an editorial board. Submissions of poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, and scholarly, academic essays are accepted for consideration. Submissions come from, Greek-Americans, Greeks, and Philhellenes from throughout the world. In addition to the various literary works we publish, we also publish artworks that are often avant garde in nature. We are a progressive, avant garde organization and publication that strives to bridge the gaps and disparities between Modern Greek academia and the modern-day Greek communities. The publication strives to educate future generations as well as the general public beyond the Hellenic world, so that the Hellenic experience and the stories of the Greek Diaspora are heard. These are the voices of a people not fully accepted as white yet not fully embraced as people of color. We are strengtheing and bringing together Hellenes and Philhellenes throughout the world. </strong>
</h3>
<p><strong>Born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, Annamarie Buonocore is a proud Greek-American who wants to progressively give back to her community and help fellow Greek-Americans, Greeks, and Philhellenes explore the joys of writing and publish their writing in a community publication. She sees that the community needs a literary journal that will feature works of fiction and poetry along with scholarly essays and avant garde artworks. A life-long poet and writer with a strong family background in journalism and publishing, she explored her passion for literature and developed her own publishing company, Nine Muses Press. It all began when she was in the church choir and became inspired by the hymnology and music of the Greek Orthodox Church. She heard stories and voices that needed to be heard and attempted to execute the project through a small Hellenic museum in the same city as her church that is operated by a fellow parishioner. When ideas took different paths and economic times became more difficult, Annamarie continued the project as an independent publication and organization and developed a publishing company that places Greeks and Greek-Americans at the forefront of its mission. </strong></p>

 man's journey of life lessons. Sean M. Flynn chronicles his experiences
 from a streetwise, adventurous adolescent on the vivid streets of South
 Side Chicago to a doting son, devoted father, committed brother, uncle,
 and God-fearing Christian. THE MANUAL identifies the key attributes 
that every minority male must balance in order to become a REAL man. Its
 a very honest and relatable story that accurately depicts life in the 
harsh inner city. THE MANUAL narrates that manhood is not about the 
conquest of women, producing babies, or even making a lot of money. THE 
MANUAL teaches everyone--regardless of age, gender or race--that REAL 
manhood is first and foremost about seeking a perfect union with God and
 living one's life in accordance with Godly principles. THE MANUAL is a 
blueprint for living a life of peace and prosperity for one's self, 
one's family,  and one's community. Its an essential guideline for 
growing from a boy to a man.</p>
<p>THE MANUAL was initially just a thought bore out of Sean M.
 Flynn’s concern for the tragedies befalling young minority males 
growing up in Chicago. By working with the youth for several years, Mr. 
Flynn discovered that many of the hardships and difficulties most of 
those children faced were similar to adversities he’d overcome in his 
own life. The main difference was that while Mr. Flynn had maintained 
the hope that life can and will get better in the midst of difficulties,
 the young men he encountered didn’t believe that faith in better days 
was a practical reality for them.</p>
<p>Understandably, these actualities lead Mr. Flynn to begin 
writing his memoir in March 2013. By May 2013, the preliminary version 
of THE MANUAL was born. From June 2013 to December 2013, several 
versions of THE MANUAL were created. From then until January 2014, the 
book has been fully edited, crafted, and designed in its entirety.</p>
<p>As of February 2014, the only thing that still needs to be 
accomplished in order to bring THE MANUAL to the masses of youth who 
need it is funding to support the mass production of hard copies of the 
book for retail distribution, to pay for promotional costs, and to cover
 expenses that are necessary to provide supplemental male mentoring to 
various urban communities. The total funding needed to materialize THE 
MANUAL is an estimated $65,000. A local printing manufacturer, has 
offered Mr. Flynn an estimated quote and turnaround time of 5-7 days for
 the completion of hard copies of THE MANUAL. Provided Mr. Flynn’s goal 
amount is reached and funds are disbursed timely, production for THE 
MANUAL can begin immediately and, by April 2014, THE MANUAL can be 
circulated amongst online and retail bookstores nationwide.</p>

The purpose of THE MANUAL is to affect positive change in a
 young minority male's life. In Chicago, hundreds of minority male's are
 killed year after year succumbing to street violence, death, jail or 
drugs. The skyrocketing violence amongst the youth has been well 
publicized  on CNN this past summer. There is a real need for for action
 to be taken in the city. Lots of adolescents lose their way navigating 
through their young adult lives due to lack of guidance. This is where 
THE MANUAL comes in. The book, in and of itself can be a help to a young
 man, but also its principles serves as the core curriculum taught in 
the Male Mentor Program sponsored by Standing in the Gap Foundation, 
LLC. Its imperative that such a tool is made available to at risk teens 
in need of it the most. If you really want to make a difference, if you 
really want to affect change in someone's life, if you really want to 
save a poor soul that is drowning, make it possible for young males in 
Chicago to receive beneficial guidance from someone who's been there and
 done that.<br/><p></p><p></p><br/></div>","THE MANUAL is an inspirational memoir of positive change. A

and, as shocking as this may seem, I don’t believe that politicians and
bureaucrats in Washington can fix our problems. 
At this point, I don’t even think the current cast of characters we
elected can fix the government’s problems. </p>
<p>  Here’s the
good news.  It’s our fault.  Politicians can’t fix our problems because
they’re not supposed to.  We’re supposed
to fix our problems.  Us.  Ordinary citizens.  You.  Me.

shirt and those <u>pants</u>.

can.  </p>
<p>  That’s why
I wrote <i>Power to the People (Really). </i>I
want to remind Americans that we live in a self-governing republic.  That means that we govern our own behavior
and we govern the country.  We don’t vote
god-like geniuses into office who “run the country” and “take care of us.”  Their inability to do so should be quite
apparent by now. </p>
<p>  Here’s
where you come in.  The deal I’ve got
with my publisher, Dietz Press in Petersburg, Virginia, is that I bring the
book to him professionally copy-edited, laid out and with a cover design, and
he’ll publish it and get it into some bookstores around Richmond, Virginia,
where I live.  I also need to get a
certain number of pre-sales before he’ll print the book.  No, this is not a vanity publisher; it's a legitimate small publisher who hasn't published a book like mine before. 
</p>
<p>  I’ve gotten estimates from
recommended professionals.  The copy editing
comes in at about $1200, the layout at $600, and the cover design at $700.  The grand total is $2500.  In the interests of transparency, I added
some money to their estimates because things happen and turn out more expensive
than planned.  I’ll use any extra funds
for marketing the book.  I will post the
financial records for this project on the website power2thepeoplebookc.ipage.com.</p>

embedded in the post “Power to the People.” 
You could also google “Craig Comess” and <i>Richmond Times-Dispatch</i> to see some newspaper columns I’ve written.       </p><p>   Incidentally, I'm embedding the original PowerPoint in my blog under ""Power to the People II"" so that you can see what it is supposed to look like.  When the PowerPoint was converted to video and then put on Vimeo, the slides started to bleed into each other.  I'm not very experienced at working with video. </p></div>","Hi.  I’m Craig Comess,

comes in at about $1200, the layout at $600, and the cover design at $700.  The grand total is $2500.  In the interests of transparency, I added
some money to their estimates because things happen and turn out more expensive
than planned.  I’ll use any extra funds
for marketing the book.  I will post the
financial records for this project on the website power2thepeoplebookc.ipage.com.
  If you want
to find out more about me and the book, check out the website at
http://power2thepeoplebookc.ipage.com.  You can also check out my blog Everybody Has a Right to My Opinion to
see read some sample chapters.  They are
embedded in the post “Power to the People.” 
You could also google “Craig Comess” and Richmond Times-Dispatch to see some newspaper columns I’ve written.          Incidentally, I'm embedding the original PowerPoint in my blog under ""Power to the People II"" so that you can see what it is supposed to look like.  When the PowerPoint was converted to video and then put on Vimeo, the slides started to bleed into each other.  I'm not very experienced at working with video.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>This isn't specifically about my upcoming project, but it is great news for me as a writer. My book that came out this spring, ""The World Was My Oyster But I Didn't Know How to Cook,"" has just been awarded the Princeton Literary Review's Gold Standard for Literary Excellence.

<h2><strong>ANOTHER UPDATE!<br/></strong></h2>
<p>I've officially started writing this and the storyline is really coming together. In a few days I'll share a little bit about it. Not a <em>lot</em> because I've already told you how superstitious I am when it comes to talking about what I'm writing while it's still so new. When I do that, I starting messing it all up and then I write less and less until finally all I do is lay in my bed and complain. And that's not good for anyone.</p>
<p>But I did want to report back that now that I have the plot laid out, things are starting to rocket right along. It's contemporary and will probably be a little controversial. Gotta love a little literary controversy!</p>

<h2><strong>UPDATE!<br/></strong></h2>
<p>The first few days of this campaign have been great! I'm so thankful to those who have contributed, or have started helping me spread the word. I know there are many good causes out there you could spend your money or your time on, and I'm grateful to know that so many people are willing to put their support behind an independent writer like me. Supporting the arts will always come back to you in ways you'd never expect. So from the bottom of my heart, thank you for the support you've given so far. I'm looking forward to the rest of the campaign and I hope you are too.<strong><br/></strong></p>

<p><strong>Who I Am</strong></p>
<p>My name is Christy Potter. I have been a journalist for the past 23 years, but after watching my chosen field change so much, I decided it's finally time to fulfill my lifelong dream of writing the Great American Novel. Well, okay, the Really Good American Novel. I'll let the critics upgrade me if they think I deserve it.</p>
<p>I've written two books over the past several years, but I recently stepped down from my full-time journalism job in order to fully focus on my next project. This is the book I've been carrying around in my head for a long time. This is the book that will get me noticed, make my name recognized, and help me achieve the goal I set long ago: to win a major book award before I turn 50.</p>
<p>Please forgive me, but I am not ready to talk publicly about the plot of the novel. This is one of my writer quirks - I can't do it until I'm substantially further along in the writing. Talking about it too soon changes my focus and changes my writing and then things start going downhill and then I get all stressed out and start writing about the Communist plot that keeps me from being able to buy vodka at 9 a.m. on a Sunday. I'm kidding. (Mostly.) But I really can't tell you right now what my book is about. I will tell you this, though: there's a reason my greatest role models are Philip Roth, John Updike, and Jonathan Franzen.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>I've published two smaller books over the past few years, so I have a solid idea of the cost to self publish. I'll have to pay an editor, and have a cover designed, plus printing, promotion, shipping, and the day-to-day expenses of taking time out from everything else in order to write and do research.</p>
<p>That said, I know it is a leap of financial faith to back a writer. In my case, you can rest assured that I'm the real thing. Check my blog, <a href=""http://www.ChristytheWriter.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ChristytheWriter.com</a>, or search my name on Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, and iTunes. I'm not a bored housewife who wants to write a book because she has nothing else to do. I'm not someone who bought book-writing software and thinks I might just take a crack at it, what the heck. I'm an award-winning writer with many publishing credits to my name. Book writing, while my first love and true passion, doesn't make many of us filthy rich. A financial boost from you would enable me to focus fully on what I know will be my breakout novel.<br/><br/>What you get in return is explained in more detail below. But the one thing that everyone who donates, or helps spread the word about my campaign, will get is the knowledge that you're supporting an artist, helping a writer realize her true potential, giving an independent author a little boost. You're helping to bring another book into the world. As the saying goes, the earth without art is just ""eh.""</p>
<p>And perhaps most importantly, when I've reached the heights to which I'm aiming, the first thing I will do is reach my hand out to help give other writers the same kind of boost. That's just how it should work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What if Money is Just Too Tight?<br/></strong></p>
<p>You may not be in a position to help me financially, and believe me, I understand. You can still help support my project by telling your friends and colleagues about what I'm doing. Give them a link to this page so they can see for themselves. Anything you can do to help me spread the word would be greatly appreciated. Indiegogo has some share tools available for you to use.<br/><br/>Thank you, everyone who is still reading, for taking the time to get to know me and hear about my dreams. Since the day I self-published and Crayon-illustrated the book in my campaign photo, I've been nurturing this dream. Now, with your help, I can make it come true.<br/><br/></p>

<p>As those of you who have taken an Outlaw Yoga class can attest,
we have stumbled on to something pretty fun here. What started off as a new way
to practice a new way of being in a fun and LOUD environment, has since grown
into a revolution of contemporary yoga.</p>
<p>A yoga that challenges us to stop making excuses, that
empowers us to go beyond the physical and take our practice off of the mat, one
that allows opportunity for real connection at so many levels. A practice,
sometimes on our mats, that gives us a reason to step up...either that, or a
moment to step out.</p>
<p>My experiences in life have been interesting to say the
least. From fucking everything that moves, to working with gang members in war
zones, my life has been chance after chance for me to fuck up...to fall...and
to get back up. In publishing a measure of my story alongside some of the
experiments and lessons that I have encountered along the way, I hope only to
demonstrate that more is always possible, that whether it is on the mat or off,
in the cage or in the kitchen, anyone has the power within to take a look, take
ownership, and to take action in the story of their lives. </p>
<p>There were a couple of options to publish this book, but I
thought the most interesting one would be to allow the community to decide

<p>How many times have you had a restless night dreading having to wake up the next morning only to drive to a job that you know isn't purposeful or utilizing your full potential? I experienced this weekly in a previous corporate job...and here is my story of how I feared mediocrity, took meaningful action, and created the life I always dreamed of.</p>
<p><strong>Why write this book and how is it unique?</strong></p>
<p>Through all of my experiences in entrepreneurship, family business, and large corporations, I was very fortunate to discover my life’s calling at a young age. Couple that realization with considerable amounts of research:</p>
<p>- Gallup found that less than 30% of people are engaged in their work</p>
<p>- Albert Mehrabian’s research shows that only 7% of a person’s message to another person is verbal</p>
<p>- Daniel Pink found that people are motivated by autonomy, mastery, and purpose</p>
<p>- Only 25% of jobs are available online, 75% are discovered via personal referrals</p>
<p>- According to LinkedIn, 85% of jobs come from a person’s 2<sup>nd</sup> level connections</p>
<p>- The unemployment rate still hovers around 8% nationally, yet there are only 3.6 million jobs available</p>
<p>…and it is becoming increasingly difficult to find work that matters to the individual and society and allows you to live your passion. I started to see a shift in the executives that I work with…one group simply wanted me to do the work…the other desperately wanted a step-by-step process that would allow them to:</p>
<p>- understand themselves…their natural communication and behavioral styles</p>
<p>- understand how to read others and be able to adjust communication to meet the other person’s</p>
<p>- discover their personal brand through a defined process</p>
<p>- include what makes them unique in resumes, cover letters, LinkedIn, when networking and in interviews</p>
<p>- learn best practices for using LinkedIn to find new clients or new jobs</p>
<p>- establish personal advisory boards to foster continual growth, learning, and renewal </p>
<p><strong>What will I learn?</strong></p>
<p>The book is a manual/blue print/step-by-step process for taking the DISC assessment, incorporating the knowledge learned throughout the career transition process, and sharing career development best practices.</p>
<p>In the book, the reader is given an access code to the DISC assessment (the same process as StrengthsFinder 2.0), provided a portal to take the assessment online, walked through the different sections of the DISC, asked for additional insights via self-assessment and the identification of work priorities, and then uses that to create guiding statements (i.e. personal mission or vision statements).

<p>I then give tactical advice on how to incorporate the DISC into and live one’s personal brand in person and online filtering it throughout the networking process, general communication tips, and when interviewing.

I experienced this weekly in a previous corporate job...and here is my story of how I feared mediocrity, took meaningful action, and created the life I always dreamed of.
Why write this book and how is it unique?
Through all of my experiences in entrepreneurship, family business, and large corporations, I was very fortunate to discover my life’s calling at a young age. Couple that realization with considerable amounts of research:
- Gallup found that less than 30% of people are engaged in their work
- Albert Mehrabian’s research shows that only 7% of a person’s message to another person is verbal
- Daniel Pink found that people are motivated by autonomy, mastery, and purpose
- Only 25% of jobs are available online, 75% are discovered via personal referrals
- According to LinkedIn, 85% of jobs come from a person’s 2nd level connections
- The unemployment rate still hovers around 8% nationally, yet there are only 3.6 million jobs available
…and it is becoming increasingly difficult to find work that matters to the individual and society and allows you to live your passion. I started to see a shift in the executives that I work with…one group simply wanted me to do the work…the other desperately wanted a step-by-step process that would allow them to:
- understand themselves…their natural communication and behavioral styles
- understand how to read others and be able to adjust communication to meet the other person’s
- discover their personal brand through a defined process
- include what makes them unique in resumes, cover letters, LinkedIn, when networking and in interviews
- learn best practices for using LinkedIn to find new clients or new jobs
- establish personal advisory boards to foster continual growth, learning, and renewal 
What will I learn?
The book is a manual/blue print/step-by-step process for taking the DISC assessment, incorporating the knowledge learned throughout the career transition process, and sharing career development best practices.
In the book, the reader is given an access code to the DISC assessment (the same process as StrengthsFinder 2.0), provided a portal to take the assessment online, walked through the different sections of the DISC, asked for additional insights via self-assessment and the identification of work priorities, and then uses that to create guiding statements (i.e. personal mission or vision statements). From there, I show the reader how to write meaningful accomplishment development statements (resume bullet points) and filter those throughout their resume, cover letter, 30-second commercial, and LinkedIn (ensuring that DISC content is included throughout).
I then give tactical advice on how to incorporate the DISC into and live one’s personal brand in person and online filtering it throughout the networking process, general communication tips, and when interviewing. Because the job search never ends, I’ve also developed best practices to foster continual growth and learning via the 70 / 20 / 10 principle, formal education, certifications, and the adoption of a personal advisory board.
In short, the book is a how-to guide for the major components of career transition full of incredible resources, templates, and ideas that readers can use to unlock their own potential.

I am so excited to finally share this labor of love with you all. I wrote this book because I wanted to create the foundational guide to sports nutrition for athletes that I wish had existed for me. Learning how to fuel myself properly is the main reason I was able to earn my spot on the track and cross country teams at Duke University, but when I was first trying out new foods and recipes, the information I could find on what athletes should and shouldn't eat was overwhelming and confusing. With AthlEATS, I create a unique guide to this complicated topic by including exclusive interviews with olympians, world series champions, and registered dietitians on their experiences learning to fuel at an elite level. In addition to sharing stories from these experts and tying them into foundational nutrition topics, I’ve added easy recipes for you to put each chapter’s recommendations into practice.<br/><br/>After two years as a Division one athlete, I have learned from multiple sports dietitians and understand even more about the complexities and best practices when it comes to fueling. I hope to provide a base for athletes to not only understand the huge impact eating well will have on their performance, but also the understanding that a great diet doesn’t mean obsessing over protein and calories - and looks different for everyone. Just as an Olympic marathoner will have a different diet than an NFL quarterback, the way YOU fuel yourself and your goals should be personally tailored to what makes you feel and perform your best. I’m not saying this is easy to find; patience will be key while you experiment and search for what works the best for you. But I promise it will be worth it.<br/><br/>Although I will certainly share tips tailored to athletes who expend thousands of calories a day, this book is for everyone. Whether you are looking to stop feeling tired all day, see more time on the field, or see more gains in the weight room, the stories and information I share will help you take your happiness and health to the next level by providing you with a deep understanding of what your body needs and when. My ultimate hope is that after reading AthlEATS, you will be three things: aware of the importance of nutrition, equipped with recipes to level up your game, and fully confident and guilt-free when indulging in the occasional burger and fries.<br/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE BOOK BREAKDOWN - AthlEATS</strong></p><p>The book is written in 2 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1 </strong>contains the introduction + chapters [1-7].

In these final chapters, I focus on how to balance eating whole foods that fuel your body with delicious foods that fuel your soul. With exclusive interviews from athletes like Olympic medalist April Ross and Ironman champion Jesse Thomas, I share how elite athletes themselves still eat pizza and ice-cream, and have learned to deal with the pressure society puts on athletes to eat perfectly and look a certain way.<br/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>WHAT I NEED &amp; WHAT YOU'LL GET</strong></u></p><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p><i>6,834: What a nightly ‘I love you’ taught me about life, leadership, and the pursuit of happiness</i> is the story of growing up with an entrepreneurial mom and how that influenced every aspect of my life, from dating to my career. I retell the story of my relationship with my mom and how her entrepreneurial spirit inspired my own journey.<br/><br/>My name is Olivia McDonnell and I am the author of <i>6,834: What a nightly ‘I love you’ taught me about life, leadership, and the pursuit of happiness</i>. I wrote this book because the greatest gift my mom ever gave me was the confidence to walk into any room that I earned a spot in.  <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the profound power of love between a mother and daughter while inspiring the next generation of women to see themselves in executive roles. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to escape from the status quo and join our journey of a few laughs, and a few tears, both in and outside of the boardroom.</p>
<p><i>6,834: What a nightly ‘I love you’ taught me about life, leadership, and the pursuit of happiness</i> speaks to moms and young women, who grapple with imposter syndrome and challenging the status quo in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that this book inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does having an entrepreneurial role model impact the life of a young girl?</li>
<li>How can we shatter the glass ceiling through having more female role models?</li>
<li>How do women overcome imposter syndrome within their career or at home?</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing female entrepreneurship will change us all for the better.</p>
<h3><strong>About The Author</strong></h3>
<p>Olivia McDonnell is an author and entrepreneur with nine years of experience successfully climbing the ranks of Wall Street before pursuing her MBA at the University of Southern California Marshall School of Business.<br/><br/>Never someone to accept the status quo, Olivia decided to write this book when she realized how growing up with an entrepreneurial mom gave her a unique perspective on life. Understanding that entrepreneurship is the backbone to achieving the American Dream, Olivia is passionate about empowering disruptors and innovators.  <br/><br/>An avid music lover and aspiring beach bum, you’re most likely to find Olivia driving the PCH with her sunglasses on, hair blowing in the wind, and singing along with the radio.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Olivia McDonnell at OliviaMcDonnell.Author@gmail.com and at @OliviaMcDonnell_author.</p>

I want you to see this book as an opportunity to escape from the status quo and join our journey of a few laughs, and a few tears, both in and outside of the boardroom.
6,834: What a nightly ‘I love you’ taught me about life, leadership, and the pursuit of happiness speaks to moms and young women, who grapple with imposter syndrome and challenging the status quo in a new way.Ultimately, I hope that this book inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:

How does having an entrepreneurial role model impact the life of a young girl?
How can we shatter the glass ceiling through having more female role models?
How do women overcome imposter syndrome within their career or at home?

I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing female entrepreneurship will change us all for the better.
About The Author
Olivia McDonnell is an author and entrepreneur with nine years of experience successfully climbing the ranks of Wall Street before pursuing her MBA at the University of Southern California Marshall School of Business.Never someone to accept the status quo, Olivia decided to write this book when she realized how growing up with an entrepreneurial mom gave her a unique perspective on life. Understanding that entrepreneurship is the backbone to achieving the American Dream, Olivia is passionate about empowering disruptors and innovators.  An avid music lover and aspiring beach bum, you’re most likely to find Olivia driving the PCH with her sunglasses on, hair blowing in the wind, and singing along with the radio.For more information, you can connect with Olivia McDonnell at OliviaMcDonnell.Author@gmail.com and at @OliviaMcDonnell_author.

What We Need & What You'll Get
This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:

The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2021.
The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)
The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).
The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
The launch & promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Spring.

When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover and an audiobook.

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier. The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:
Please share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #6834Book and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so we can help amplify your efforts.
You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page.
Please share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it via text or direct message on social media.
Thank you so much for all of your love and support!Thanks again,Olivia McDonnell",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

After years of traveling and sharing spoken word poetry, this
book is my offering of prayers, lessons, memories, culture, testimony,
medicine, and magic for the betterment of our world. I speak as a child of
indigenous and Latin American diaspora, and as a young queer woman of color activist.Why This Book Matters


 Because I'm one of few Latina/Mestiza young
women committed and dedicated to sharing their truth out loud through poetry in
community.

Because the book gives voice to a queer woman of
color, and shares herstory, a story that is often made invisible or
oversimplified by mainstream culture.

 Because it speaks openly about mestizaje,
queerness, spirituality, and activism
 Because it brings healing and connection

 Because it invites a new generation of women's
voices to be affirmed and not shamed and silenced

What Will Be in the BookNew poems that share the lived realities and
perspectives of women of color on topics like: 
Diaspora
Equal pay

Reproductive
rights
Response
to sexual assault
Love
Hoodology
Music
Moon Time
Loving Man
Loving Woman
Colonialism
Theology
Culture
Purpose
etc
As well as:



Poems presented at the 2014 Texas Democratic
Convention, TEDxUrsulineCollege, The Dallas Museum of Art, The Prindle

A sampling of my most popular spoken word
pieces, including: In the Grey, Music 101, and Where I'm From

Why I Am Self-Publishing

Learning
to control forms of production for myself and my community is a sustainable cultural
investment 

It's
a way to share my community's voice that has historically been excluded from
mainstream production
To
carve out new spaces for alternative voices to be heard
To
empower my community to collaborate in my creating
Because
collective production builds strong communities of solidarity

Since its creation, Sass &amp; Balderdash has grown to over 5,500 followers and has been included in WordPress.com's list of recommended humor blogs. It's a space to laugh at everyday life, pop culture, and - perhaps most importantly - yourself.</p>
<p><b>Who Am I?</b></p>
<p>I'm Katie Hoffman, and aside from the occasional guest post, I create all the content on Sass &amp; Balderdash. Sass &amp; Balderdash is near to my heart because I started writing it at a time in my life when a lot of things were changing. In September 2012, I had lost about 100 pounds over the course of the prior year, and I was struggling to find a full-time job after graduating in May. This has been my first experiment with both blogging and humor writing, and I'm really proud of my little corner of the Internet.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Web design, web design, web design. I plan on moving self-hosting Sass &amp; Balderdash soon, and I have a very specific vision for how the page will look--it just so happens that vision is expensive. I want it to look more professional, be responsive across devices, and maybe even generate an oooh-aaah or two.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>When I started writing this blog, I never anticipated anyone would read it. It seemed like one of those whims I decided to act on that wouldn't stick like so many diets and fashion trends I've experimented with in the past. As a writer, I feel like I've really grown up with this blog, and having the resources to make it into a more professional, functional, beautiful space feels like the next step to growing it even more.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I know $1250 is a lot of money, but I don't want you to donate all that--unless you're Diddy. I just need 250 people to skip their $5 coffee in favor of using the Keurig at home one morning. If it's a generous crowd, 125 people could skip lunch at Corner Bakery and contribute $10.</p>
<p>I don't make any money from my blog, but I put time, thought, and effort into it as if it were another full-time job. I know we all have bills to pay, but if you happen to have any loose change you could spare from your couch cushions, I'd appreciate it.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Share this page! Twitter, Facebook, email, <i>anything</i>. Even if you can't donate anything, I'll still love you for sharing this. Also, if you happen to know any web designers with serious skills who wouldn't mind dealing with a low-key controlling blogger, pass their information along.</p>

As a writer, I feel like I've really grown up with this blog, and having the resources to make it into a more professional, functional, beautiful space feels like the next step to growing it even more.
    Risks & Challenges I know $1250 is a lot of money, but I don't want you to donate all that--unless you're Diddy. I just need 250 people to skip their $5 coffee in favor of using the Keurig at home one morning. If it's a generous crowd, 125 people could skip lunch at Corner Bakery and contribute $10.
I don't make any money from my blog, but I put time, thought, and effort into it as if it were another full-time job. I know we all have bills to pay, but if you happen to have any loose change you could spare from your couch cushions, I'd appreciate it.
    Other Ways You Can Help Share this page! Twitter, Facebook, email, anything. Even if you can't donate anything, I'll still love you for sharing this. Also, if you happen to know any web designers with serious skills who wouldn't mind dealing with a low-key controlling blogger, pass their information along.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","10-julio-2015. Actualización 4.1.
Atención, primicia del episodio de anoche, TODOS los mecenas que pillen un pack que incluya recompensas, se llevarán además la mini de Monje de MoM Miniaturas! No podemos editar los pledges, pero lo añadimos en su descripción aquí mismo más abajo.




Gracias Manu! ;)

09-julio-2015. Actualización 4.
La actualización de hoy trae las suficientes novedades como para que alteremos la apariencia habitual de esta página.
Hemos añadido nuevas opciones de aportación. Hay disponible un nuevo pack que lleva camiseta en vez de taza, con los mismos extras y opciones. La camiseta será en color negro con esta ilustración, cortesía de Bad Roll Games:

Además, metemos como añadidos las opciones de camiseta y taza. Vamos, que te has comprado la taza y quieres la camiseta? Pues 10€ tienen la culpa... Que quieres añadir más tazas a tu pledge? Pues 10€ tienen la culpa... ""Oye, pero yo os di pasta de más y ahora me molaría camiseta..."" No pasa nada, escríbenos a la dirección de correo de siempre, nos lo cuentas y lo apañamos...
""Bueno, me mola mazo la camiseta y paso de la taza..."" Idem... ;)
Obviamente así no recaudaremos más, pero entendemos que a estas alturas hacer esta modificación puede ser un fastidio para vosotros... Ya os contamos en la pasada actualización que nos había costado MUCHO decidir qué hacíamos con la imagen en cuestión... ;)
Además, todos los pledges se llevarán un nuevo añadido, que NO puede meter en las descripciones, porque la plataforma no está preparada para meter tantas cosas, pero que SÍ actualizaré aquí, en la historia de la campaña.


Cortesía del Museo de L'Iber, Museo de los Soldaditos de Plomo, de aquí de Valencia, os llevaréis un descuento del 50% en la próxima entrada que vayáis a comprar para visitar sus instalaciones. Os dejamos aquí un enlace a su web para que pichoneéis un poco ;)

http://www.museoliber.org
Lo dicho, gracias por vuestras aportaciones, y a ver si en estos días de final de campaña conseguimos entre todos pegar un último empujón y sacarla adelante! ;)
Turno Cu4tro es un podcast extremadamente gamberro dedicado a tratar temas de actualidad, y no tan actualidad, en el mundillo de las miniaturas y los wargames.




Tras 3 temporadas de podcast y varias incursiones en el mundillo de los vídeos en youtube, el equipo que utilizamos se nos ha quedado corto para hacer las cosas que queremos ofrecer a nuestro público habitual.

El equipo del podcast dispone de recursos MUY LIMITADOS, ya que no contamos con el patrocinio económico ni el apoyo de marcas ni particulares, por lo que llegar a reunir el monto económico suficiente para comprar el material que necesitamos nos llevaría al menos otra temporada y media... demasiado tiempo para nosotros y esperamos que para vosotros ;)

Con este nuevo equipo mejoraría notablemente la calidad técnica de nuestro podcast y la producción de los vídeos que hemos vuelto a grabar. Principalmente lograremos una mejor calidad de sonido en todo lo que hagamos y no se nos volverá a extraviar un episodio por un fallo de la plataforma.


Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes

 Necesitamos, en principio, algo más de 600€ para material, básicamente una mesa de mezclas, una grabadora digital, micros, antorcha, pie basculante, etc...

Pensamos que para conmemorar vuestra ayuda a la compra del material queríamos que os llevaseis un recuerdo, algo físico que pudieseis utilizar. Qué mejor que una taza con nuestro logo? XD

Las tazas son a prueba de microondas, lavavajillas y, de momento, parece que de frikazos como nosotros... XD

Pero no os lleváis sólo la taza! Gracias a los compis, y no tan compis, que tenemos repartidos a día de hoy por este mundillo, también os lleváis, según la recompensa que escojáis, 3 dados de placaje de Willy Miniatures o una mini de Willy Miniatures, un vale de descuento del 15% en Willy Miniatures, una mini de Resina Planet para Euphoria, un reglamento licenciado de Dadi&Piombo, una lámina conmemorativa de Jordi Bayarri, etc... material valorado en más de 40€ sin contar la taza en sí!

Qué recompensas hay disponibles?

A dónde va a parar mi pasta?
Por si os preguntáis a dónde va exactamente vuestra pasta, aquí os lo detallamos:

Por tanto, unos 11,68€ se van en pagar la taza, la reproducción de la lámina, comisiones varias y los gastos de envío... lo que nos deja que de cada aportación nos quedan algo más de 4€ para material.

<p>I’m the author of the nonfiction book, <strong>Writing and the Spiritual Life: Finding Your Voice Within</strong>, from McGraw-Hill. My first collection of poetry, <strong>Territory of Wind</strong>, came out from Many Names Press, in 1998. About that book, poet Al Young said, “Vecchione’s compass of feeling, thought and memory point forever towards ‘the hum and buzz of the inner hive,’ where everything starts out sacred and stays that way.” Since the publication of <strong>Territory of Wind</strong>, I’ve been writing poems and storing them in that inner hive. Now is the time to bring them into the light. My forthcoming book, <strong>The Knot Untied</strong>, is the culmination of these years of writing.</p>
<p>The publishing world has become an extremely difficult one, based significantly on the bottom line. Rather than enter that fray, I’d like <strong>The Knot Untied</strong> to be published by the community of people who want to read it. This project is a first venture in what I’m calling Community Publishing. Purchase your copy of the book in advance, or give one as a gift, and support its publication. Contribute at a higher level and your name will be included in the book’s acknowledgements. Perhaps you’d care to opt for a perk that entitles you to a reading and workshop in your home for a group of your friends.</p>
<p><strong>The Knot Untied</strong> will be published in the spring of 2013. The first two events have just been scheduled: a reading/signing at Bookshop Santa Cruz and one at The Steinbeck Center in Salinas, California.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>Have you always dreamed of being a book publisher? Now’s your chance! Your support will make it possible for these poems to live in the pages of a book, to be read by others. Even if being a publisher isn’t on your bucket-list, a love of reading poetry is reason enough to join in. Poetry can shorten the divide between people. It shows us how connected we are to each other and lights a path through the forest.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU WILL GET</strong></p>
<p>The amount needed to produce <strong>The Knot Untied</strong> is $5,500. Lucky for me, graphic designer, Jerry Takigawa, and I are trading services, so that significant part of the project is covered, and it ensures a gorgeous-looking book. The cover art is my own.</p>
<p>Everyone who contributes $25 or more will receive a signed copy of the book, approximately 80 pages.</p>
<p>Those who contribute $75 or more will also have their name included in the book’s acknowledgements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>Help me untie this knot by spreading the word! Tell your poetry-loving friends about this project and encourage them to participate.</p>
<p>Suggest this title to your local bookstore.</p>
<p>Organize a reading in your community.</p>

I’m the author of the nonfiction book, Writing and the Spiritual Life: Finding Your Voice Within, from McGraw-Hill. My first collection of poetry, Territory of Wind, came out from Many Names Press, in 1998. About that book, poet Al Young said, “Vecchione’s compass of feeling, thought and memory point forever towards ‘the hum and buzz of the inner hive,’ where everything starts out sacred and stays that way.” Since the publication of Territory of Wind, I’ve been writing poems and storing them in that inner hive. Now is the time to bring them into the light. My forthcoming book, The Knot Untied, is the culmination of these years of writing.
The publishing world has become an extremely difficult one, based significantly on the bottom line. Rather than enter that fray, I’d like The Knot Untied to be published by the community of people who want to read it. This project is a first venture in what I’m calling Community Publishing. Purchase your copy of the book in advance, or give one as a gift, and support its publication. Contribute at a higher level and your name will be included in the book’s acknowledgements. Perhaps you’d care to opt for a perk that entitles you to a reading and workshop in your home for a group of your friends.
The Knot Untied will be published in the spring of 2013. The first two events have just been scheduled: a reading/signing at Bookshop Santa Cruz and one at The Steinbeck Center in Salinas, California.
  
THE IMPACT
Have you always dreamed of being a book publisher? Now’s your chance! Your support will make it possible for these poems to live in the pages of a book, to be read by others. Even if being a publisher isn’t on your bucket-list, a love of reading poetry is reason enough to join in. Poetry can shorten the divide between people. It shows us how connected we are to each other and lights a path through the forest.
  
WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU WILL GET
The amount needed to produce The Knot Untied is $5,500. Lucky for me, graphic designer, Jerry Takigawa, and I are trading services, so that significant part of the project is covered, and it ensures a gorgeous-looking book. The cover art is my own.
Everyone who contributes $25 or more will receive a signed copy of the book, approximately 80 pages.
Those who contribute $75 or more will also have their name included in the book’s acknowledgements.
 
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
Help me untie this knot by spreading the word! Tell your poetry-loving friends about this project and encourage them to participate.
Suggest this title to your local bookstore.
Organize a reading in your community.
  
A SELECTION OF POEMS FROM THE KNOT UNITED
 
SING FOR YOUR SUPPER
What if singing
was how you earned your living—
each day, year after year.
The sky above you is blue.
Clouds billow like white dresses.
They are yours
though you do not own them.
Your voice flickers
like a pinwheel of color.
Old uncle has his tune,
as do your sisters and cousins.
Every answer has its question.
Songs, little melodies,
are your job,
for which you never
earn any money.
You live in a house
in a tree.
Rarely do your feet
touch the ground.
Imagine!
 
MY FRIEND MEMORIZES HER GRANDSON’S FACE
In the kitchen, with the summer party going on outside,
you say, “When the baby was sick,
I climbed in bed beside him,
because it is too easy to forget,
and I want to remember.”
 
You remember the furrowed brow in sleep,
flushed cheeks, the unrehearsed perfection of his mouth,
the jewel box of a little fevered face.
 
What will you keep in your purse,
in the zippered clutch of memory?
 
Everything changes.
And too soon,
too soon.
 
CLIMB
Once we crossed Broadway at 153rd St. there was the A & P,
the shopping carts glaring in the summer sun, lined up
at the ready like a parade before the start whistle.
And beyond that there was the big hill.
Even at five, I didn’t like exertion,
especially because the top of the hill hadn’t  much to offer,
except the cool interior of the big, stone church
that I preferred to the heat of city sunlight.
 
For a moment I’d be relieved to be inside, happy even.
The cool darkness made me so, and the surprise, each time,
though I always knew what was coming,
when I dipped my fingertips in the holy water
and the chill startled my forehead awake
and made me forget about outside, the climb
that had tired me and quickened my breath.
After blessing myself, not that I ever felt blessed,
my hand would fall back inside my mother’s hand,
clasping it,, the way one holds something
she’s afraid of losing.
 
Of course I couldn’t have foreseen a loss of innocence,
but I did sense change was on the horizon
like cats know an earthquake’s coming and prick up their ears
before the ground’s slightest tremor, and I knew I would endure.
I would not blot out like my vision did for a moment
upon entering the dark sanctuary from the glare
of shopping carts, the sharpness of the sun.
 
But something in me would want to shut, would be inclined to,
like the bold  church doors, heavy on their hinges,
a compelling desire, to not have to keep standing and shining
as I was driven to by the slight but insistent push of my mother’s hand 
on my back as I approached the altar of my life.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi! My name is Mary Metcalfe. I am a professional writer/editor who has completed the third novel in a series set near Boston, Massachusetts. In <em>Road to Tomorrow</em>, I explore Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) and its effects on a young military family.</p>
<p>The RAND Corporation, a highly-respected international research organization, estimates that 300,000 returning American military personnel have varying degrees of TBI. Only in recent years has funding and support been made available to these 'walking wounded'. Spousal abuse is common as are divorces among these victims.</p>
<p>TBIs occur through any trauma to the head, meaning that literally millions of people around the world are dealing with the aftermath of TBIs. For example, a concussion is a TBI.One concussion may heal completely. Multiple concussions? Probably not. Many amateur and professional athletes see their careers end as TBI symptoms worsen over time.</p>
<p>There are many causes: sports injuries, car accidents, falls, blasts - any hit to the head, whatever the cause, results in TBI.</p>
<p>My only aunt saw her successful writing career end abruptly after she suffered TBIs following being hit by a car. I know now that my father came home from World War II with TBI. In my research for <em>Road to Tomorrow</em>, I have met others online who are estranged from their families and struggle with day-to-day living including so many things we take for granted like walking, gardening, reading, writing.</p>
<p>The publication of <em>Road to Tomorrow</em> this fall is my way of helping to bring TBI into mainstream awareness in a way that will shed light on the problem and encourage those suffering with TBI to seek the help and support that could improve their lives.</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<i>Separated: An Owner’s Guide</i> — This book highlights the process of dealing with shoulder injuries through several lenses including the US healthcare system, technology, and genetics.<br/><br/>My name is Trevor Lee and I am the author of <i>Separated: An Owner’s Guide</i>. I wrote this book because there are enthralling, emerging initiatives that improve the prevention and recovery process of shoulder injuries. I want to see the next young swimmer or basketball player keenly protect their health while enjoying and dominating their sport.<br/><br/>My aim is that, in reading this book, you will better appreciate your shoulder and the people who have or are helping you take care of it. I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the shoulder and its intersections in other subject matters in you. Ultimately, I want you to see the ideas in the book as tools to enhance your shoulder and wellbeing.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about shoulder injuries and emerging innovations:<ul>
<li>Drew Brees’ miraculous surgery and rise after Hurricane Katrina</li>
<li>The financial hardships endured by a former football player</li>
<li>How technologies like VR can directly shape health outcomes</li>
<li>And countless other topics</li>
</ul> You will love this book if you or someone that you know has experienced a shoulder problem.<br/><br/><i>Separated: An Owner’s Guide</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to athletes, weekend warriors, and patients with shoulder problems who are looking at the shoulder and associated diseases for the first time.<br/> <h3>The Book - <i>Separated: An Owner’s Guide</i>
</h3> The book is written in three parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-4.

Separated: An Owner’s Guide — This book highlights the process of dealing with shoulder injuries through several lenses including the US healthcare system, technology, and genetics.My name is Trevor Lee and I am the author of Separated: An Owner’s Guide. I wrote this book because there are enthralling, emerging initiatives that improve the prevention and recovery process of shoulder injuries. I want to see the next young swimmer or basketball player keenly protect their health while enjoying and dominating their sport.My aim is that, in reading this book, you will better appreciate your shoulder and the people who have or are helping you take care of it. I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the shoulder and its intersections in other subject matters in you. Ultimately, I want you to see the ideas in the book as tools to enhance your shoulder and wellbeing.In this book, you'll learn about shoulder injuries and emerging innovations:
Drew Brees’ miraculous surgery and rise after Hurricane Katrina
The financial hardships endured by a former football player
How technologies like VR can directly shape health outcomes
And countless other topics
 You will love this book if you or someone that you know has experienced a shoulder problem.Separated: An Owner’s Guide is a non-fiction book that speaks to athletes, weekend warriors, and patients with shoulder problems who are looking at the shoulder and associated diseases for the first time. The Book - Separated: An Owner’s Guide
 The book is written in three parts.Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-4. The basic framework is established, where we venture through the anatomy and physiology of the shoulder, symptoms of various disorders, and the origin stories of shoulder treatments.

An assorted collection of innovations and perspectives — gene therapy, new technologies, and more — are explored.

<p>Now, back to the original campaign text:</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Hi everyone! Below you'll find a detailed description of my project. If you're short on time, please read ""In a Nutshell"" and then jump between <strong>bolded</strong> sections. Thank you!  -Blake</em></p>
<p><em>***Also, don't miss the ""Updates"" tab (above) to find important news!***</em></p>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<h3>In a Nutshell...</h3>
<p><strong><em>Hi, I'm Blake</em>.</strong> I've written an awesome book manuscript (<strong><a href=""http://www.scribd.com/blake_boles_1/d/81486515-Better-Than-College-How-to-Build-a-Successful-Life-Without-a-Four-Year-Degree-Preface-Excerpt?secret_password=1w1bk5nc416g1mqv1tzt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">here's an excerpt</a></strong>) that provides a genuine alternative to the overpriced college experience—but I need your help to publish it.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, this fundraiser will <strong>help me to create a top-notch book</strong> and <strong>help you get</strong><strong> a great pre-order deal</strong>! I will directly invest the money that I raise in the editing, design, printing, and other up-front costs necessary to bring the book to life.</p>
<p>When you contribute to this campaign, you'll receive a package of unique ""perks."" (You can browse these on the right). Most of these will <em>only</em> be available through IndieGoGo! Find a package that you like, click ""Claim This Perk,"" and in a few months, when the book is published, I'll send you the perks. Easy!</p>
<p>Beyond the perks, however, <strong>your contribution will fuel the spread of a vitally important idea: That you can build a successful life without a four-year degree</strong>. Too many people believe that ""college=success"" and therefore everyone should take out $20,000+ in student loans. We <em>must</em> change that idea—and together, we will. </p>
<p>To learn more about the book, please continue reading below.</p>
<br/><hr/>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Why is College Overrated?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em>Once, a long long time ago</em>, a 4-year college degree guaranteed a stable economic future. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em>Today</em>, a 4-year degree offers $25,000 in student loan debt, a spot on mom’s couch, and your very own place in the Craigslist breadline. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">If you're supremely confident that you'd like to enter a licensed profession (doctor, lawyer, etc.), do Ph.D.-level research science, or work for a big traditional institution (e.g. an investment bank or the government), then you should go to the best college that you can get into.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">But if, on the other hand:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">you suspect that becoming a doctor, lawyer, architect, scientist, professor, or banker is really somebody else’s goal for you,</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">you’re interested in the liberal arts, studio art, technology, starting your own business, or working with your hands,</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">you suspect that you haven’t seen enough of the world to really focus in college,</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">you’re mostly interested in the social aspect of college,</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">or you’re simply unsure about everything,</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">...then <strong>postponing, leaving, or skipping college might be <em>the best thing you ever do</em></strong>. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We've heard a lot of these arguments over the past few years. It's easy to find an article or book that (rightly) criticizes college. <strong>But:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">There's no book that provides a concrete alternative path for young adults facing the college decision right now.</span></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">To make a smart decision about going to college (and taking on life-crushing student loans), <strong>young adults need a genuine alternative to college</strong>: <strong>one that provides real-world skills, financial security, and a sense of meaning</strong>. That alternative already exists, but no one has described it well. <em>That's where you &amp; I come in</em>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 style=""text-align: left;"">The Book</h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong><em>Better Than College: </em></strong><em style=""font-weight: 800;"">How to Build a Successful Life Without a Four-Year Degree</em> is a step-by-step guide to postponing, leaving, or skipping college. The book describes how to harness the power of <em>self-directed learning </em>to give yourself a higher education in five strategic steps:</p>
<ol>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Build Self-Knowledge</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Give Yourself Assignments</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Create &amp; Share Value</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Find Support</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Market Yourself</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em>Better Than College</em> also features:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">interviews with young adults (many of whom unschooled as teens) who deliberately decided to skip college in favor of self-directed learning</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">a discussion of the modern economic trends that demand a self-directed, entrepreneurial approach to learning</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">guidance for getting hired without a college degree</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">tons of specific advice and tips for beginning your self-directed higher education <em>today</em> </li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The book will be lean (&lt; 150 pages)—no fluff—and focus exclusively on providing young people (and those of any age) with the most useful, practical, and well-reasoned insight for choosing self-directed learning over institutional education.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: left;"">What I Have, What I Need, and Where the Money Will Go</h3>
</div>
<p>As of February 2012, I have:</p>
<div style=""border-color: initial !important;"">
<ul>
<li>Performed all interviews</li>
<li>Written a preliminary manuscript</li>
<li>Submitted the manuscript to 20+ associates in the world of alternative education, received a ton of useful feedback, and revised the manuscript accordingly</li>
</ul>
<div>That's a good start, but it's a long way from a clean, polished final product. <strong>With the money I raise through this campaign, I will purchase</strong>:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Line-by-line editing by two different professional editors </li>
<li>Professional interior design (i.e. typesetting)</li>
<li>Professional cover design (e-book + physical book)</li>
<li>Professional e-book conversion (to .mobi for Kindle and .ePub for Sony, iBooks, Nook, etc.)</li>
<li>ISBN, copyright, and Library of Congress registration</li>
<li>Proof printing and the initial print run to send to IndieGoGo contributers</li>
<li>Additional copies of the book to send to alternative education pioneers and potential reviewers</li>
<li>Postage &amp; supplies necessary to mail everything</li>
</ul>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong><em>These are the investments necessary to produce a top-notch book—and they're pricey</em></strong>. <strong>By raising $8500 or more by March 19th, 2012,</strong> I can secure the editorial, design, and printing services necessary to create a professional book that influential people will take seriously and then <em>further spread its message.</em>

<h3>An Indie Publishing Venture</h3>
<p>I released my first book, <em>College Without High School</em>, through a traditional publisher. That was a positive experience that taught me what goes into professional publishing. This time, <strong>I'm independently publishing my book</strong> in order to retain full rights to the work. That way I can give away free copies to those who need it most, offer special discounts, and run innovative fundraisers like this one! <strong>By supporting this campaign you're supporting a 100% indie publishing venture!</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>If I <em>don't meet</em> my $8500 goal, I will still move forward with the project and use whatever funds raised to publish and ship the best possible book. But more funds will equal a better book and an important message spread farther!</div>

Now, back to the original campaign text:

Hi everyone! Below you'll find a detailed description of my project. If you're short on time, please read ""In a Nutshell"" and then jump between bolded sections. Thank you!  -Blake
***Also, don't miss the ""Updates"" tab (above) to find important news!***

 
In a Nutshell...
Hi, I'm Blake. I've written an awesome book manuscript (here's an excerpt) that provides a genuine alternative to the overpriced college experience—but I need your help to publish it.
In a nutshell, this fundraiser will help me to create a top-notch book and help you get a great pre-order deal! I will directly invest the money that I raise in the editing, design, printing, and other up-front costs necessary to bring the book to life.
When you contribute to this campaign, you'll receive a package of unique ""perks."" (You can browse these on the right). Most of these will only be available through IndieGoGo! Find a package that you like, click ""Claim This Perk,"" and in a few months, when the book is published, I'll send you the perks. Easy!
Beyond the perks, however, your contribution will fuel the spread of a vitally important idea: That you can build a successful life without a four-year degree. Too many people believe that ""college=success"" and therefore everyone should take out $20,000+ in student loans. We must change that idea—and together, we will. 
To learn more about the book, please continue reading below.

 
Why is College Overrated?
Once, a long long time ago, a 4-year college degree guaranteed a stable economic future. 
Today, a 4-year degree offers $25,000 in student loan debt, a spot on mom’s couch, and your very own place in the Craigslist breadline. 
If you're supremely confident that you'd like to enter a licensed profession (doctor, lawyer, etc.), do Ph.D.-level research science, or work for a big traditional institution (e.g. an investment bank or the government), then you should go to the best college that you can get into.
But if, on the other hand:

you suspect that becoming a doctor, lawyer, architect, scientist, professor, or banker is really somebody else’s goal for you,
you’re interested in the liberal arts, studio art, technology, starting your own business, or working with your hands,
you suspect that you haven’t seen enough of the world to really focus in college,
you’re mostly interested in the social aspect of college,
or you’re simply unsure about everything,

...then postponing, leaving, or skipping college might be the best thing you ever do. 
We've heard a lot of these arguments over the past few years. It's easy to find an article or book that (rightly) criticizes college. But:
There's no book that provides a concrete alternative path for young adults facing the college decision right now.
To make a smart decision about going to college (and taking on life-crushing student loans), young adults need a genuine alternative to college: one that provides real-world skills, financial security, and a sense of meaning. That alternative already exists, but no one has described it well. That's where you & I come in.
 


The Book
Better Than College: How to Build a Successful Life Without a Four-Year Degree is a step-by-step guide to postponing, leaving, or skipping college. The book describes how to harness the power of self-directed learning to give yourself a higher education in five strategic steps:

Build Self-Knowledge
Give Yourself Assignments
Create & Share Value
Find Support
Market Yourself

Better Than College also features:

interviews with young adults (many of whom unschooled as teens) who deliberately decided to skip college in favor of self-directed learning
a discussion of the modern economic trends that demand a self-directed, entrepreneurial approach to learning
guidance for getting hired without a college degree
tons of specific advice and tips for beginning your self-directed higher education today 

The book will be lean (< 150 pages)—no fluff—and focus exclusively on providing young people (and those of any age) with the most useful, practical, and well-reasoned insight for choosing self-directed learning over institutional education.
To get a taste for the book, check out this excerpt from the preface!
 


What I Have, What I Need, and Where the Money Will Go

As of February 2012, I have:


Performed all interviews
Written a preliminary manuscript
Submitted the manuscript to 20+ associates in the world of alternative education, received a ton of useful feedback, and revised the manuscript accordingly

That's a good start, but it's a long way from a clean, polished final product. With the money I raise through this campaign, I will purchase:


Line-by-line editing by two different professional editors 
Professional interior design (i.e. typesetting)
Professional cover design (e-book + physical book)
Professional e-book conversion (to .mobi for Kindle and .ePub for Sony, iBooks, Nook, etc.)
ISBN, copyright, and Library of Congress registration
Proof printing and the initial print run to send to IndieGoGo contributers
Additional copies of the book to send to alternative education pioneers and potential reviewers
Postage & supplies necessary to mail everything

 

These are the investments necessary to produce a top-notch book—and they're pricey. By raising $8500 or more by March 19th, 2012, I can secure the editorial, design, and printing services necessary to create a professional book that influential people will take seriously and then further spread its message.


***See the ""Updates"" tab for a detailed breakdown of where the money goes.***


 
An Indie Publishing Venture
I released my first book, College Without High School, through a traditional publisher. That was a positive experience that taught me what goes into professional publishing. This time, I'm independently publishing my book in order to retain full rights to the work. That way I can give away free copies to those who need it most, offer special discounts, and run innovative fundraisers like this one! By supporting this campaign you're supporting a 100% indie publishing venture!



If I don't meet my $8500 goal, I will still move forward with the project and use whatever funds raised to publish and ship the best possible book. But more funds will equal a better book and an important message spread farther!

 




When Will You Receive the Book?
The planned release date for the book is June 6, 2012. As an IndieGoGo contributer, your books will ship one week early, on May 30th. (Please allow for slight date shifts due to unforeseen production factors.)

<h3>The Entryway</h3>
<p>My name is Rob Queen, <a href=""https://robwqueen.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">writer and teacher</a>. When I'm not teaching, I'm writing. When I'm not writing, I'm teaching. This current dual career came at the end of over a dozen years in equine services. It was partially my previous career with horses that spawned this tale, especially as my love for beasts is not limited to horses, but stretches to just about every type of animal (minus mosquitoes. Not much a fan of them, I'll admit). The other thing that influenced <i>Escape from the Spotlight</i> was my love of a good superhero story. </p>
<p>Combine the two elements, and <i>Escape from the Spotlight</i> was born. This would be the third published book written by myself, following my <i><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Twelve-Cataclysms-Protasis-Rob-Queen/dp/1499528442/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1478709279&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=twelve+cataclysms"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Twelve Cataclysms: Protasis</a></i> and <i><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/wamped-Jim-Lillie-ebook/dp/B008PYM1DC/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1506880862&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=%24wamped"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">$wamped</a></i>, which I co-wrote with James Lillie. </p>
<p>Simply put, I love story-telling as much as a cat loves changing its mind when it begs to have its belly rubbed. Indiegogo is a medium for the execution of my enduring love of story-telling, one that I used before to raise funds to publish <i>The Twelve Cataclysms</i>. This particular campaign has two goals: to bring <i>Escape from the Spotlight</i> into the spotlight of publication, and to help set up the funding for ongoing tales in this world where individuals are more than just human.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Exhibit</h3>
<p>This is not a Young Adult novel. It is an exploration of life. In the grand tradition of DC and Marvel, <i>Escape from the Spotlight </i>is written as if Patty Jenkins Christopher Nolan was in the director's seat.</p>
<p>Doran is young, but it's an important time in life that, should he survive, will invariably define many aspects of his future. Though Doran is the primary exhibit, he is not alone. Off the beaten path, like in any Sanctuary, there are a number of exhibits that showcase the teenage years. Through the hi-energy school editor Mia, the charismatic Reed, and the athletic Mo, the story explores the nuance and problems that not only come with the teenage years, but also the problems - personal and peer - that come with powers. </p>
<p>As anyone who has spent time with animals would know, each animal is a unique entity that brings their own sense of self to the page. <i>Escape from the Spotlight </i>explores the deeper sense of consequence and informed decision-making, all wrapped up in an adventure of discovery and mystery.</p>
<p>I have shared the first chapter of this novel for your reading pleasure. <a href=""https://wordpress.com/read/feeds/72330246/posts/1630506793"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Check it out</a>, and come back to contribute!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Administration </h3>
<p>To provide this book with its escape from concept to the liberation of publication, it will need several things. </p>
<p>The first is the cover. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/jeanpascal.leclerckegle"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jean-Pascal Leclerc Kegle</a> has done a great job with the cover, but he needs payment. Similarly, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/hde.ponsonbyjones"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HdE</a> will need his rate for his excellent lettering on the final product. Following the remuneration to these talents, the book will need several things for itself. Though self-publication via Amazon.com's Createspace is an affordable entity, it is not free. Layout, formatting, editing, and publishing costs all stack up. In addition to this will be the marketing, which will carry the author to a number of reading venues to help introduce the story to a wider audience. One particular means of marketing is its submission into some fiction competitions, most notably <a href=""http://www.indiebookawards.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Indie Book Awards</a>, which would give <i>Escape from the Spotlight</i> a significant amount of visibility should it be successful.</p>
<p>One other area that your funding will navigate is yourselves. Your funding will find its way back to you in the manner of the exclusive perks that are mentioned on this campaign page. For more details as to what those Perks are, just take a look at the side of the page and start thinking about how nice it would be to have a limited edition flash drive, or a poster of the cover signed by the author and cover artist, or even the main event - your very own copy of <i>Escape from the Spotlight</i>. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Upkeep</h3>
<p>As a special perk, any contribution of $100 or greater will lead to a worthwhile cause outside of just creating great art. As mentioned above, animals are incredibly important to me, and with larger contributions, you will be aiding me in the publication of the book as well as providing a donation towards the care and upkeep of animals. How does that work? I will be using no less than half of the contribution and collecting it into a single donation to the animal charity (compiled from the contributions of all of you) from the ""Trustees of the Titus Sanctuary."" I will be  updating details regarding its distribution as it happens, as well as invite suggestions for the charity. In that way, we can keep a running dialogue of distribution to so as to figure out the best means of making sure the beasties are best cared for. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Contingencies</h3>
<p>Animals are notorious for finding ways of creating havoc in our lives, and while we often forgive them for being the wonderful creatures they are, contingencies are nonetheless important. For this campaign, even if we don't reach our planned goal, your contribution will still net you the Perks that you contributed towards. From this end, your contribution will provide payment according to need: publication, perks, marketing. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Feeding</h3>
<p>Every contribution, whether $1 or $100, helps to reach our goal in 30 days. So, too, does getting the word out about this project! Even more than just monetarily, word-of-mouth and your excitement helps multiply the value of your support.</p>
<ul>
<li>Please tell a friend, or 25 friends, or even a 100 friends, acquaintances and co-workers, clients, about <i>Escape from the Spotlight</i>!</li>
<li>Get the word out by phone, email, and by talking it up.</li>
<li>Post a message on your <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/12-Cataclysms-Rob-Queen-1402185413364388/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook </a>page.</li>
<li>Even better, post a link to the campaign <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Z1Hw_5U-Xk&amp;t=4s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">video</a>.</li>
<li>Tweet a link to this IndieGoGo page.</li>
<li>Share the image of the cover on Instagram!</li>
<li>Visit my <a href=""http://robwqueen.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website and blog </a>to stay up-to-date on all my offerings.</li>
</ul>
<p>*Some people are not yet familiar with the power of crowd-funding. Explain how it works and motivate someone to check out this campaign.</p>
<h3>The Nutrients</h3>
<p>This is the second crowd-funding campaign that I have set up. The first one, for <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Twelve-Cataclysms-Protasis-Rob-Queen/dp/1499528442/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1506884713&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=twelve+cataclysms"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Twelve Cataclysms: Protasis </a>was my first foray into the world of crowd-funding. This second time around, I feel more confident with regards to perks, limitations, possibilities, as well as overall security with this as a means of connecting to people.</p>
<h3>The Animals</h3>
<p>Like the animals who star in this adventure, this is a campaign that cannot survive without attention and nurturing.

</div></div>","The Entryway
My name is Rob Queen, writer and teacher. When I'm not teaching, I'm writing. When I'm not writing, I'm teaching. This current dual career came at the end of over a dozen years in equine services. It was partially my previous career with horses that spawned this tale, especially as my love for beasts is not limited to horses, but stretches to just about every type of animal (minus mosquitoes. Not much a fan of them, I'll admit). The other thing that influenced Escape from the Spotlight was my love of a good superhero story. 
Combine the two elements, and Escape from the Spotlight was born. This would be the third published book written by myself, following my The Twelve Cataclysms: Protasis and $wamped, which I co-wrote with James Lillie. 
Simply put, I love story-telling as much as a cat loves changing its mind when it begs to have its belly rubbed. Indiegogo is a medium for the execution of my enduring love of story-telling, one that I used before to raise funds to publish The Twelve Cataclysms. This particular campaign has two goals: to bring Escape from the Spotlight into the spotlight of publication, and to help set up the funding for ongoing tales in this world where individuals are more than just human.
 

The Exhibit
This is not a Young Adult novel. It is an exploration of life. In the grand tradition of DC and Marvel, Escape from the Spotlight is written as if Patty Jenkins Christopher Nolan was in the director's seat.
Doran is young, but it's an important time in life that, should he survive, will invariably define many aspects of his future. Though Doran is the primary exhibit, he is not alone. Off the beaten path, like in any Sanctuary, there are a number of exhibits that showcase the teenage years. Through the hi-energy school editor Mia, the charismatic Reed, and the athletic Mo, the story explores the nuance and problems that not only come with the teenage years, but also the problems - personal and peer - that come with powers. 
As anyone who has spent time with animals would know, each animal is a unique entity that brings their own sense of self to the page. Escape from the Spotlight explores the deeper sense of consequence and informed decision-making, all wrapped up in an adventure of discovery and mystery.
I have shared the first chapter of this novel for your reading pleasure. Check it out, and come back to contribute!
 
The Administration 
To provide this book with its escape from concept to the liberation of publication, it will need several things. 
The first is the cover. Jean-Pascal Leclerc Kegle has done a great job with the cover, but he needs payment. Similarly, HdE will need his rate for his excellent lettering on the final product. Following the remuneration to these talents, the book will need several things for itself. Though self-publication via Amazon.com's Createspace is an affordable entity, it is not free. Layout, formatting, editing, and publishing costs all stack up. In addition to this will be the marketing, which will carry the author to a number of reading venues to help introduce the story to a wider audience. One particular means of marketing is its submission into some fiction competitions, most notably The Indie Book Awards, which would give Escape from the Spotlight a significant amount of visibility should it be successful.
One other area that your funding will navigate is yourselves. Your funding will find its way back to you in the manner of the exclusive perks that are mentioned on this campaign page. For more details as to what those Perks are, just take a look at the side of the page and start thinking about how nice it would be to have a limited edition flash drive, or a poster of the cover signed by the author and cover artist, or even the main event - your very own copy of Escape from the Spotlight. 
 
Upkeep
As a special perk, any contribution of $100 or greater will lead to a worthwhile cause outside of just creating great art. As mentioned above, animals are incredibly important to me, and with larger contributions, you will be aiding me in the publication of the book as well as providing a donation towards the care and upkeep of animals. How does that work? I will be using no less than half of the contribution and collecting it into a single donation to the animal charity (compiled from the contributions of all of you) from the ""Trustees of the Titus Sanctuary."" I will be  updating details regarding its distribution as it happens, as well as invite suggestions for the charity. In that way, we can keep a running dialogue of distribution to so as to figure out the best means of making sure the beasties are best cared for. 
 
Contingencies
Animals are notorious for finding ways of creating havoc in our lives, and while we often forgive them for being the wonderful creatures they are, contingencies are nonetheless important. For this campaign, even if we don't reach our planned goal, your contribution will still net you the Perks that you contributed towards. From this end, your contribution will provide payment according to need: publication, perks, marketing. 
 
Feeding
Every contribution, whether $1 or $100, helps to reach our goal in 30 days. So, too, does getting the word out about this project! Even more than just monetarily, word-of-mouth and your excitement helps multiply the value of your support.

Please tell a friend, or 25 friends, or even a 100 friends, acquaintances and co-workers, clients, about Escape from the Spotlight!
Get the word out by phone, email, and by talking it up.
Post a message on your Facebook page.
Even better, post a link to the campaign video.
Tweet a link to this IndieGoGo page.
Share the image of the cover on Instagram!
Visit my website and blog to stay up-to-date on all my offerings.

*Some people are not yet familiar with the power of crowd-funding. Explain how it works and motivate someone to check out this campaign.
The Nutrients
This is the second crowd-funding campaign that I have set up. The first one, for The Twelve Cataclysms: Protasis was my first foray into the world of crowd-funding. This second time around, I feel more confident with regards to perks, limitations, possibilities, as well as overall security with this as a means of connecting to people.
The Animals
Like the animals who star in this adventure, this is a campaign that cannot survive without attention and nurturing. There is no fast-track to success, but with the help of supporters like you, that success can be reached, and opportunities for growth will present themselves. Just as Doran and his family occasionally have to do to keep their animal sanctuary solvent, I am standing under the spotlight of the show, asking for your help. Help bring the irony of this title to its very own spotlight, where it can stand tall and proud, successful of its own merit.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>Thinking Horizontally </i>is a book about how to focus your entrepreneurial mindset on growing horizontally. Whether you are an existing business owner or planning a startup, this book will help to achieve success through a horizontal mindset and ideology.<br/><br/>My name is James Manske, and I am the author of <i>Thinking Horizontally</i>. I wrote this book because I have experienced continued success through the thought process of thinking horizontally during many years in business, which began at the age of ten. I have been fortunate enough to find multiple corollary options to expand sales, businesses, and growth.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover new ways to view your business or a new business you are looking to start by understanding how diversification in your industry works. I want you to consider this book as a pathway to seek out additional opportunities in your current field and simplify processes to grow your bottom line. By understanding the methods and mindset in this book, you will be able to break free from the thought processes that many originally believed were the only way to become successful in business.<br/><br/><br/><u><strong>FOR ALL:</strong></u><br/><br/><i>Thinking Horizontally</i> speaks to entrepreneurs and those seeking to start new businesses and those business owners who are feeling stagnant. If you are grappling with creating new revenue streams and a better future, this book will help you simplify your company processes in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Thinking Horizontally</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<p>What areas of my company can I implement simplicity?</p>
<p>Where are there possible corollary opportunities that can be created?</p>
<p>How can I hire great talent and become more analytical in my business?</p>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing these answers and ideologies from successful individuals will change us all for the better.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong><i>Thinking Horizontally</i></strong></u></p>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><i>Part 1 How We Got Here:</i><br/>Contains the author’s note + chapters [1-3]. This section focuses on what separates successful entrepreneurs from the ordinary by exploring a focused mindset and the art of diversification. Without the proper focus or ability to think horizontally, you must realize that there is no better time to work on expansion than now. Time is of the essence when building success for the rest of your life.<br/><br/><i>Part 2 Principles of the Expansion Mindset:</i></p>
<p>Contains chapters [4-8]. In these chapters, you will learn how to explore corollary opportunities internally and externally for your business. Customers are also a big part of diversification. This section examines different ways to increase sales with your current clientele. You will also learn that by creating a rock-star team and focusing on the analytics, you will be able to easily implement new horizontal growth.<br/><br/><i>Part 3 How to Build the Expansion Mindset:</i></p>
<p>Contains chapters [9-11]. In this section, we discuss what makes you want to be better. What wants and goals do you have and how can horizontal thinking help you to achieve these dreams? What is holding you back in your current situation and how to utilize your skills to push out the negative, change your situation, and reach success? Guinio Valpone is a great example of how to achieve greatness. In his college years of living in his car to being able to pivot throughout his entrepreneurial journey, Guinio has built a very successful empire of tech companies that generate over nine-figures in sales.<br/><br/> </p>

<p>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</p>
<p>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this spring of 2021.</p>

What happens to us when our lives get uprooted?  How do we sweep the fragments together and carve a path forward?  The reality is, no matter what happens to us, we never get to go back to the beginning.  We must all start....from the middle.   This book takes a personal and graphic look at a young teenage girl who watches her father and mother die.  She is sent to live in servitude with strangers and eventually escapes on a ship.  She survives only to be betrayed again, and again, ... and again.  It’s a tribute of perseverance in a life continuously interrupted by life.--------------My hope is that in reading this book, you will see the celebration of yourself and where you come from.  This novel should serve as both an encouragement and a reminder that GODDIE  lives in all of us.  It is my desire to show that just as our mothers and fathers did, we can survive too. The tenaciousness of our parents, sewn into our DNA, is alive and well.  The standard is there for all of us.  Let’s get up and get going.The journey of this book meets the reader who lives at the crossroads of aspiration and anguish.  A time when classes ruled the masses, and simplicity and gratefulness were the tools of survival.  This book is for anyone who has had to leave everything they’ve ever known.  It’s for that person who went somewhere they’ve never been, to get something they’ve never had.  Goddie's masterclass examines the potency of Jamaican culture through the lens of loss, poverty, and discovery.  Witness the granular transition of a poor girl learning how to recover again, and again, ...and again.Allow me to introduce you to GODDIE.  A novel based on a true story. What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be self-published in partnership with New Degree Press.  I am raising the publishing funds myself to own the book's creative rights and to invite readers on my journey.   I have set up various pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for final publication.  *Money raised will go towards the following:** The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in August 2021.* The Cover Design of my book - The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!!* The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats).* The Copy Editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.* The Launch & Promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this summer.When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish.When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition.When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook! I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:

However, there are many misconceptions about these mergers and acquisitions, the way in which these companies are valued and the manner in which they are sold. I will provide you with my take on these issues, liberally sprinkled with wisdom gleaned through my 30 years of martial arts training.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover some of the clear misconceptions about the way in which these companies are valued. In this book, I hope to share the same sort of passion and excitement I have for acquisitions and show you how the philosophies learned through my martial arts training have helped me succeed. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you build a 5 to 10-year game plan to prepare your company for a sale or merger, putting you light years ahead of your competition.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the trends and insights from major players in our industry.</p><ul>
<li>The vast majority of advisors - in fact over 80% - have no written succession or continuity plan.</li>
<li>Personal insights about my 15 years of experience in acquisitions</li>
<li>Classic mistakes first time buyers and sellers make, drawing on examples from various industries in corporate America.</li>

This section covers some of the new trends in financing and some interesting martial arts analogies. You will also see how some of the changes in the industry are affecting the present and future buyers.<br/><br/>Part [3] contains Chapters 6 through 9. This section covers a successful acquisition and a contentious acquisition. In addition, it covers one executive’s journey as he re-tooled a major firm to make it more proactive and competitive. You will also learn about the challenges facing Amazon, Grubhub, DoorDash, and other meal delivery firms as they scramble to achieve profitability while also playing in the M&amp;A space.<br/><br/>Part [4] contains chapters 7 through 10 and includes interviews with top advisors and firms that are involved with valuation and selling methodologies. There are some key takeaways to help you build and refine your practice along with stories about other non-financial companies that have done extensive work in the acquisitions area.</p><p><br/>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get<br/><br/>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

However, there are many misconceptions about these mergers and acquisitions, the way in which these companies are valued and the manner in which they are sold. I will provide you with my take on these issues, liberally sprinkled with wisdom gleaned through my 30 years of martial arts training.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover some of the clear misconceptions about the way in which these companies are valued. In this book, I hope to share the same sort of passion and excitement I have for acquisitions and show you how the philosophies learned through my martial arts training have helped me succeed. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you build a 5 to 10-year game plan to prepare your company for a sale or merger, putting you light years ahead of your competition.In this book, you'll learn about the trends and insights from major players in our industry.
The vast majority of advisors - in fact over 80% - have no written succession or continuity plan.
Personal insights about my 15 years of experience in acquisitions
Classic mistakes first time buyers and sellers make, drawing on examples from various industries in corporate America.
Why playing the long game, and planning years in advance, is the ONLY way to win in this competitive environment.

This section covers some of the new trends in financing and some interesting martial arts analogies. You will also see how some of the changes in the industry are affecting the present and future buyers.Part [3] contains Chapters 6 through 9.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>Nova University imagines the future of higher education through the lens of the student experience.<br/><br/>My name is Wren Lee and I am the author of Nova University. I wrote this book to imagine a university that works on solving the current issues within higher education. As a student, I know about the experiences my friends and I have had with higher ed and how frustrated we get sometimes. I empathize with college students in the US and want to help them.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover new ways to approach higher education. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to kickstart a revolution within higher education. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of higher education and the student experience through concepts like:<ul>
<li>Micro-housing</li>
<li>Competency-based education</li>
<li>Student-directed learning</li>
</ul>
<br/>You will love this book if you are currently or previously associated with an institution of higher education, if you want higher education to change, or if you enjoy thinking about the future.<br/><br/>Nova University speaks to current students, staff, and faculty and futurists who want to grapple with higher education and access and equity in higher education in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Nova University inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<ul>
<li>How might we help college students become aware, educated members of society?</li>
<li>How might we promote personal development and growth in universities?</li>
<li>How might we prepare college students for interdisciplinary, collaborative post-graduate work?</li>
</ul>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers.

I wrote this book because I felt powerless in my life goal of helping save the environment, yet through researching and after interviewing various powerful “eco-winners“, I gained hope and understanding on what is needed to help the Earth; starting with my own community, first.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will be inspired by the stories of Eco-winners to start and continue your advocacy and live according to your ideals in protecting the beautiful Earth we live on. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for environmental advocacy in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you change the environmental policies or movements within your own communities and, quite possibly, on a global scale as well. <br/><br/>In this book, you will learn about environmental leaders and how to take create a real impact on the world now:</p><ul>
<li>Story of Greta Thunberg: the story of how a thirteen year old environmental advocate created the greatest global climate-strike movement in history, impacting more than 20 countries.</li>
<li>Story of Wangari Maathai: the story of how a rural Kenyan woman created the Green Belt Movement, a nationwide movement in which rural women in Africa planted millions of trees to support their communities and oppose dictatorship Earth-harming government regime</li>
<li>Story of Heidi Harmon: the story of the Mayor of San Luis Obispo, who went from being a discouraged single mom to becoming the leader of multiple environmental organizations and marches, and eventually the main green legislator in Central California. </li>
</ul><p>You will love this book if you are an environmentalist or a person born of this Earth. <br/>Eco Winneris a non-fiction book that speaks to students, young adults, and just people who want to protect the Earth we live on or who are looking at making an impact and fighting environmentally-degrading companies and legislation for the first time. </p><p> </p><h2>The Book - Eco Winners</h2><p>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/>Part 1: <strong>Eco History</strong> contains the introduction + the incredible story of Greta Thunberg, and chapters that give an overview of how Earth’s resources have been overused throughout history. Throughout this section, you will learn about major events that transformed the Earth and how we now use and abuse it, including insights into the First Agricultural Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and the current meat, coal, natural gas, and agricultural markets. <br/><br/>Part 2: <strong>Eco Winners</strong> contains Chapters 5-10, chapters in which I explore the stories of Eco-winners, starting from local environmental movements including beach clean-ups and tree-plantings, to national movements including stopping destructive pipelines and petitioning the government. One of my favorite moments was when I interviewed a recent college graduate not much older than me who, to my surprise, already had gotten arrested twice for the fight for the environmental movement, manually stopped the building of a pipeline, and overall lived life fearlessly according to her ideals. <br/><br/>Part 3: <strong>Eco World</strong> contains Chapters [10-15]. In these chapters I go into more depth about the impacts of different organizations and companies and their influence on the world. In this chapter, we explore different environmental organizations including Environmental Defense Fund, Sierra Club, and companies including Amazon, Fjallraven, Glossier, and more. These chapters show the importance of the environmental impacts of companies and governments, and how, surprisingly, an individual person can influence both corporations and legislation.</p><p> </p><h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.
