<br/><br/><p><b>HUGE SAVINGS!</b></p>
<p>For bids of $50 - $100, you will receive a signed voucher from myself, exclusive to the Indiegogo Campaign. This voucher gives you a once off  <b>10% discount off</b>,  per booking, on our famous chauffeur tours at any of our stores worldwide.</p>
<p> As we cater for tour groups, of up to 100 bikes per tour, this would be considered as an individual booking, so you do the math!</p>
<p><b>HOW TO GET THE BEST VALUE FROM YOUR VOUCHER!</b></p>
<p>The value a person gets depends on the volume of the tour. Its  10% off whether you have one bike or 20.  So for example lets say you wanted to do our 2 hour chauffeur tour with  say 20 friends @ 599 per bike, you would make a saving of R2400 on the group tour which is great, especially if your a corporate wanting to book something a little different for that team building event and save a few rand/dollars.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So the more bikes you use on a tour the more you save! But, thats just the cost and saving for a tour which is our lowest priced product. As its more expensive to hire a Harley-Davidson and ride on your own, so the discount becomes more valuable especially if you and your group want to do a bit of bike touring. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The ""lifetime: condition is a bonus as once you use this cash to market the business and drive more volume, our prices decrease which means more saving to people with a larger discounted saving.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you are currently living or plan to travel to South Africa on holiday or on business, you can redeem your voucher for your tour or rental in Johannesburg, Durban or Cape Town. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
This fantastic offer also
extends to the rentals of our Harley-Davidson fleet which is a home away from
home for most bikers on holiday. Please note that a valid bike license will
have to be provided. <p><b><br/></b></p>

I have studied agronomy and business management (now a Haitian farmer).  I have been working for 4 years doing different agricultural businesses to help farmers. From my experiences, I want to focus on what works better and do them on larger scale. Normally, I am Social Entrepreneur. 
It's very difficult to have access to loans in my country (mainly for farming) and the interest rate are very high form (23%to 66% a year, in some rare occasion you might find an 18% from NGO or other difficult loans). 
This contribution will help me be able to save my investment from now that are 6,328 USD, keep the farm going until it start bring cash in, and plant my important products (they bring a lot of income) hot peppers and vegetables. 
The farm is a 5 acres of land with irrigations system on it (I am repairing) next to a river. 
Your Contributions will help me do these:

</span></p><p>We are a group of young Scottish
entrepreneurs who love two things: technology and whisky. But it wasn't always
like this. We graduated from university a few years ago and as our
lifestyles improved, we became tired of drinking low quality, cheap beverages.
Drinking alcohol became less about quantity and more about quality and so it
was time to upgrade our drink of choice. Being Scottish and huge fans of Mad
Men, whisky was the natural solution. Yet, like most people we felt a little
overwhelmed by choice, undereducated in taste and discouraged by price. So
much so that the thought of purchasing enough whisky to discover what we liked
didn’t appeal. So, YoCo Club was born.</p>

</span></p><p>YoCo Club is the monthly whisky subscription service
delivering a case of two single malt Scotch whiskies with accompanying tasting
notes and a membership card for as little as £27 per month. We have
selected a range of whiskies from each of Scotland's whisky regions and will be
sending subscribers a monthly case containing 1x20cl bottle of our first chosen
whisky and 4x5cl bottles of our second chosen whisky. One for you and one to
share. In other words, each case contains 40cl of whisky, which is over 12
drams for you to collect and enjoy every month. </p>

</p><p>We have included some of Scotland’s
most popular distilleries, such as Talisker and Glenlivet, as well as hidden
gems like Inchgower and Kilchoman. This ensures you get to taste and experience
the best of Scottish whisky: from the bottles that everyone raves about, to the
undiscovered drams that you would struggle to find in a bar. Rest assured,

</p><p>YoCo Club is more than a whisky club.
YoCo is an abbreviation of “Young Company” and we are on a mission to become
this generation’s answer to discovering, delivering and revelling in Scotch
whisky. We are a lifestyle club that escapes the old school image of a whisky club.
Whether you enjoy drinking whisky with ice, water, one sip at a time or all in
one go, we don’t mind and we won’t hold you to ""traditional
etiquette"". We're here to deliver great whisky directly to your door. </p>

</div></div>","We are a group of young Scottish
entrepreneurs who love two things: technology and whisky. But it wasn't always
like this. We graduated from university a few years ago and as our
lifestyles improved, we became tired of drinking low quality, cheap beverages.
Drinking alcohol became less about quantity and more about quality and so it
was time to upgrade our drink of choice. Being Scottish and huge fans of Mad
Men, whisky was the natural solution. Yet, like most people we felt a little
overwhelmed by choice, undereducated in taste and discouraged by price. So
much so that the thought of purchasing enough whisky to discover what we liked
didn’t appeal. So, YoCo Club was born.

YoCo Club is the monthly whisky subscription service
delivering a case of two single malt Scotch whiskies with accompanying tasting
notes and a membership card for as little as £27 per month. We have
selected a range of whiskies from each of Scotland's whisky regions and will be
sending subscribers a monthly case containing 1x20cl bottle of our first chosen
whisky and 4x5cl bottles of our second chosen whisky. One for you and one to
share. In other words, each case contains 40cl of whisky, which is over 12
drams for you to collect and enjoy every month. 


We have included some of Scotland’s
most popular distilleries, such as Talisker and Glenlivet, as well as hidden
gems like Inchgower and Kilchoman. This ensures you get to taste and experience
the best of Scottish whisky: from the bottles that everyone raves about, to the
undiscovered drams that you would struggle to find in a bar. Rest assured,
every whisky you receive from our great range will be a premium single malt
Scotch whisky…without compromise!

You can subscribe for either 1 month, 3 months, 6
months or 12 months and your first case will also contain a membership card
that will give you exclusive access to some of the UK's finest venues. This
will allow you to build on your knowledge and learn to appreciate the complex
tastes of each whisky. In addition to the selected whiskies, each
recurring monthly case will contain an invitation for a friend to join the club
and tasting notes about the current month's whiskies, accessible by following
the link on your membership card.
Joining the club will allow you to sample some of the world’s best whisky whilst you discover what you like and what you don’t like without racking up an expensive bar bill. It's really easy to join, just pick one of our rewards and become a founding member! 

YoCo Club is more than a whisky club.
YoCo is an abbreviation of “Young Company” and we are on a mission to become
this generation’s answer to discovering, delivering and revelling in Scotch
whisky. We are a lifestyle club that escapes the old school image of a whisky club.
Whether you enjoy drinking whisky with ice, water, one sip at a time or all in
one go, we don’t mind and we won’t hold you to ""traditional
etiquette"". We're here to deliver great whisky directly to your door. 


It's now time to introduce the Indiegogo community to YoCo Club and
share some of the world's best whisky with you. But don't just take our
word for it. World leading whisky expert Charles MacLean has joined our team of
Ambassadors and given his seal of approval: 





Select a membership. We offer 4 different memberships from 1 month to 12 months, so make sure to pick the reward that adequately quenches your
     thirst.
Every calendar month we will pick, pack and send
     your order giving you a
     full 30 days to enjoy the exquisite flavours packed inside each
     case. 
Every case contains two single malt Scotch whiskies with accompanying tasting notes, a membership card and an invitation for a friend to join the Club. Make sure to share on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram as after all, enjoying whisky makes for
     a better experience when shared in the company of others.

<p>GROW (Gaining Resilience and Opportunities for Women and
youth) is a Tanzanian-based project that builds on the collective potential of
rural women. Deep in the
lush green mountains of northwestern Tanzania lies the vibrant region of Ngara
brimming with potential in the rich farmland of the local communities. Ngara is
one of the poorest and most remote regions in Tanzania. The annual household
income is less than $95. The idea for GROW was born from the need for economic
growth in Ngara’s local sector and the recognition of the vast potential of women and youth. The project was developed by WomenCraft, a well-established social enterprise that has operated in Ngara for six years. The GROW team
strives to tap into the vast potential of the diverse natural wealth of the
region as a means to develop rural-income generating activities. We have developed a collection of sustainable
micro-entrepreneurship activities, including rice farms, sunflower farms, and
beekeeping, with the vision of expanding the economic sector, while simultaneously
improving access to nutrition and empowering local women. </p>

<p>Our primary focus for this fundraiser lies in the beekeeping
project, which holds vast potential to flourish into a profitable
business of producing honey and beeswax products. Currently GROW has 8
beekeeper groups with a total of 65 members. We believe in investing in a
small, focused project from which the profits will be reinvested to help the
expansion of the businesses and the inclusion of more group members. Our next
harvest season is quickly approaching in September and we are in need of your
help to ensure our first harvest is successful so we can secure the future of GROW. We
are seeking to raise $5,000 to supply the necessary equipment and training to
harvest this season’s first round of honey and beeswax. </p>

smoothly. </p>
<p>Your donations fund:</p>
<p>-  Protective gear and equipment, such as boots,
masks, and buckets for the harvesting, processing, and packaging procedures</p>
<p>- Training for our beekeepers to ensure high quality production of honey and beeswax</p>
<p>- A clean, secure processing and storage room for honey and beeswax</p>
<p>- Basic packaging (jars, labels) </p>
<p> Equipped with a few simple tools, our trained beekeepers can successfully harvest the first season of honey and perfect the art of honey-making and purifying beeswax. The production and sale of profitable goods allows our apiaries to increase in number, thus expanding the potential for products produced and
increasing the number of local community members who financially benefit from
participation in GROW’s beekeeping enterprise. </p>

and enable the first round of successful honey and beeswax processing to run
smoothly. 
Your donations fund:
-  Protective gear and equipment, such as boots,
masks, and buckets for the harvesting, processing, and packaging procedures
- Training for our beekeepers to ensure high quality production of honey and beeswax
- A clean, secure processing and storage room for honey and beeswax
- Basic packaging (jars, labels) 
 Equipped with a few simple tools, our trained beekeepers can successfully harvest the first season of honey and perfect the art of honey-making and purifying beeswax. The production and sale of profitable goods allows our apiaries to increase in number, thus expanding the potential for products produced and
increasing the number of local community members who financially benefit from
participation in GROW’s beekeeping enterprise. 
Other ways to help? We also appreciate help in spreading the conversation about GROW’s mission and products to
family and friends and via social media platforms and word-of-mouth. 
-Please specify that donations are being made out to GROW/beekeeping.-


                                         




Future Goals and Projected Impact
- Expand rural
income-generating activities, business skills, and financial knowledge of the
local community

-Increase the economic potential of the women and their
families involved with GROW
-Tackle gender inequality through economic empowerment, knowledge and skills workshops, and education 

We aim to tackle gender inequality and poverty
through the production of goods that can be enjoyed on a global scale and that
connect communities worldwide. The GROW team envisions a thriving
micro-enterprise business that produces, markets, and sells quality honey,
beeswax candles, and other products in the local Tanzanian and international
markets. Eventually, we hope that GROW flourishes into a self-sustainable
enterprise that gives back to the local economy and that is run by local women
whom have risen as community leaders through the GROW training.

<p>Living Room is an endeavor to build community through the love of music: connecting people with the music and musicians that they love and providing a place for Tulsans to connect with one another.</p>
<p>In 2013, after graduating college, we noticed that it was difficult to connect with people. We figured we couldn’t be the only ones that felt this way. How could we bring together community on a larger scale? What started with having friends over for dinner, and late nights listening to friends write songs grew into a solution. Living rooms are an important part of family life. From your living room, you can catch up on the world, or with some friends, you can be entertained or can find rest.

<p>Unlike your living room, is the modern concert space. While we all love a good rock show, nobody likes to feel like cattle herded in and out of a space by barking security guards. Living Room is a place where artists from around the country come and play music.

At Living Room You’re not livestock, you’re a human and we appreciate your support and contribution. </p>
<p><b>Here are the Logistics</b></p>
<p>It can be difficult to make a sufficient living as a musician. In establishing Living Room we see artist compensation as our top priority. Artists pour a large amount of time, energy and money into their craft. They deserve not only to be heard, but compensated for their efforts.</p>
<p>You can’t put on a show without sound equipment. Currently, we are supported by our friends that allow us to use their audio equipment for our events. As we host larger and more notable artists and bands, and as we look to moving into our own space, the equipment needs to be able to properly capture musicians as they want to be heard.  </p>
<p>What’s a living room without the décor? Living Room needs to feel like… well, a living room, preferably one that’s a step above a recent college graduate’s. It’s going to require a keen eye, some lights, and some decorations. But while we’re at it, we will go ahead and mention, food sales (because who doesn’t eat in their living room?) and marketing (because we got to tell you about what’s coming up next). In the future, we would love to supply a space for local vendors to sell their food.</p>
<p>You can’t have a living room without a home to put it in. As of now, our friends at HootOwl Coffee have graciously allowed us to use their retro coffee shop. Living Room would not be possible without their help and support. Our loftiest and current long term goal is acquisition, either by way of renting or owning, of a show and community Living Room space. </p><p>We need your contributions to begin all of these processes. </p>

<p><b>Your</b> cattle <b>are not given</b> to farmers which makes the model so unique, <b>it is borrowed</b> to the farmer for a specific period. This allows the project to continue indefinitely. <strong>PAYING FORWARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN</strong></p>

<p>Once the farmer has sufficient cattle of his own and created a number of sustainable jobs, the <b>borrowed cattle are moved along to another farmer</b> and the process repeats itself, creating a <strong>manageable,</strong> <b>sustainable</b> <b>PAY FORWARD concept. </b>This unique model is called <b>COW SHARING</b>. </p>

</div></div>","SOUTH AFRICA is a beautiful country and a popular holiday destination. It is where you will find one of the 7 Wonders of the World: TABLE MOUNTAIN.SOUTH AFRICA also boasts the largest economy in AFRICA with a population of 60 Million people. Many call it the Rainbow Nation, The Cradle of Human Kind, Home to Nelson Mandela and the BREAD BASKET of Africa. Over the years, MANY FOREIGNERS have seeked a better living in South Africa and made their home here.                 BUT WHAT IF THE BREADBASKET RUNS OUT OF BREAD?Currently, beautiful SOUTH AFRICA is facing a huge problem: 30% of our population is UNEMPLOYED! The situation affects millions, especially CHILDREN.
            
This means that 18 Million people are JOBLESS, creating all sorts of problems like Xenophobia, criminal activities and poverty. These problems affects the world at large. 
Throughout the years, THE PEPLER GROUP have already created 9000 SUSTAINABLE jobs in South Africa, using our own funds (more than 10 000 000 USD), by establishing 6 very successful projects and won many awards in doing so... (read more about them here: www.cowsharing.co.za ) BUT, we have not created nearly enough jobs to make a real impact on SOUTH AFRICA'S unemployment problem! 
We need to make a LASTING IMPACT on this volatile problem facing our country and continent. We had ENOUGH of this problem and it's crippling effects on society.. OUR AIM: To create jobs FASTER, bringing relief to a sea of unemployed people. The situation is VERY URGENT. OUR PLAN: To make a BIG IMMEDIATE IMPACT and we CANNOT DO IT without HELP.This is exactly WHY we turned to CROWD funding.












We believe that with YOUR HELP we can  bring about a permanent, lasting change in Africa, starting with South Africa.




         EVERY JOB that is created, IMPACT positively on at least THREE KIDS!
                                  





COW SHARING is our social OUTREACH & community UPLIFTMENT Project.(Website: www.cowsharing.co.za)
Cow SHARING is an innovative way to create JOBS in South Africa and help struggling farmers at the same time.
(See our testimonial videos below)
For the past 7 years, we have proven the concept to be sustainable
over time. It is based on a MANAGED Pay Forward Model. It is also the ultimate Sustainable
Green Economy builder. 

So how do we implement and manage COW SHARING?
Please view our MAIN VIDEO for more information on Cow SHARING or go to our website: www.cowsharing.co.zaYou may also e-mail us at: info @ cowsharing.co.za OR call us directly on +27 83 309 3157Please view these TESTIMONIALS to witness first hand how COW SHARING has been changing lives:



_____________________________________________________________________________
YOU can help someone in SOUTH AFRICA get a job TODAY and leave your legacy!                                                             HOW ?







Yes, through COW FUNDING. We DARE YOU to match OUR OWN contributions made towards JOB CREATION in South Africa, to the value of 10 MIL USD. In doing so we will, together, create and sustain 80 000 NEW jobs!  Let us reach out to others through our Social Outreach Program.


You contribute, we purchase & manage the cattle that is placed with South African farmers on your behalf, this in return CREATES SUSTAINABLE JOBS.





Your cattle are not given to farmers which makes the model so unique, it is borrowed to the farmer for a specific period. This allows the project to continue indefinitely. PAYING FORWARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN


The farmer then shares in the proginy and builds his own herd as result over time.


Once the farmer has sufficient cattle of his own and created a number of sustainable jobs, the borrowed cattle are moved along to another farmer and the process repeats itself, creating a manageable, sustainable PAY FORWARD concept. This unique model is called COW SHARING. 


The Farmer who has been assisted now also makes a commitment to help at least 1 other farmer. It doubles the effort and the result. This way WE ENSURE the funds that you contribute continues to contribute for many years afterwards.

<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""></span>
</div>
<p>My story is straightforward. My husband moved from Greece to Armenia 5 years ago and since then he has been dreaming about opening a small open-air Greek café – a traditional <i><b>rakomeladiko</b></i> mixed with <i><b>kafenio</b></i> – a drinking and relaxation place, the type we used to go in Athens during our dating period. I love his idea!</p>
<p>My husband has found a cool green place in the center of the city, in a park, next to a small artificial lake. He has great ideas and a lot of passion but is short of cash to finalize the project. </p>
<p>In 10 days it is his birthday and the only gift worth giving I came up with – is to try to fund-raise as much as possible to make his dream come true. </p>
<p>I'm appealing to all the Greeks who live outside of Greece or those in Greece who want to see the traditions going. I'm also appealing to those who have some Greekness inside them, who appreciate good drinks with great snacks and pies, good company and relaxing outdoors, in a simple but great environment. Those who love summer, who love sun, who love blue and white colors :)</p>
<p>The money will be used to do some minor renovation (to take down crappy writings and posters), to paint the place in appropriate colors and decorate it with flowers. And of course, to bring some essential drinks from Greece as well as chairs and tables from Athens. </p>
<p>Please pitch in from $ 1 to $ 10 or just pass the information along, whatever you feel comfortable with! We will drink to your health as soon as we manage to open the café, and if you ever travel to Yerevan, Armenia - the drinks are on us! </p>
<p>You will be always welcome in our little Greek corner.</p>

<p>
</p>
<div>
<p></p>
<h3>Hello, my name is Anthony...</h3>After 15 enjoyable years as in IT consultant working for a dozen or 
more blue-chip companies I took a leap of faith to take my own ideas to 
market. My mission: to innovate ways to enrich local 
economies and communities throughout the UK.<br/><br/><p>In 2014, I launched Local Puzzle and in the first 18 months it drove 
over £500,000 revenue to local independent businesses, raised £4,000 for local schools and charities and 241 players won a combined total of £40,000 just by shopping local, playing puzzles and socialising with their friends.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some players who have learned Local Puzzle through and through claim to 
win / earn more money from playing Local Puzzle than they do from their 
day jobs. We think this is a little exaggerated, but none the less, our 
vision is to make this very true for the top 20% of our players.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>How It Works<br/>
</h3>It's simple, just shop with any of your local independent businesses (it doesn't even need to be listed on our site) then send us a photo of your receipt via email here <a href=""https://www.localpuzzle.com/receipts/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a> we'll then award you Puzzle Points. Those with the most Puzzle Points share thousands of pounds in cash every two months. That's it.<br/><br/><p>Every 6 months we give a donation to the school or charity with the more Puzzle Points you've scored, the bigger say you have in where that money goes.<br/></p>
<p>Those who want to get more involved can top up their points by collecting Puzzle Codes, playing sliding puzzles, referring their friends, sponsoring their favourite businesses, trading in virtual shares and much more. There's a whole host of fun, the more you do, the more you'll win for yourself and your chosen school or charity (if you select one).<br/></p>
<p>It's not luck, it's effort and cunning that will get you to the top.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Where Does The Money Come From?</h3>
<p>Money comes into Local Puzzle from 3 revenue streams:</p>
<p>1) Contributions that the independent businesses choose to make in return for the extra customers they get;</p>
<p>2) Some of the players themselves choose to buy tickets to events, merchandise and other bits and pieces from us (they don't have too as Local Puzzle is free to play);</p>
<p>3) Other companies pay us fees to advertise their products and services to the independent businesses listed on the Local Puzzle Platform;<br/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
</div>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<br/>This will sound strange, but Local Puzzle grows by giving away more money to it's players, local schools and charities. This then draws more money into local businesses who are then are happy to contribute back to the prize funds, creating a spiral of economic growth for the entire local community.<br/><br/>Every £1 we give away currently generates £22 revenue for independent businesses.<br/><br/>On top of the extra money we'll give away, we need to recruit a small team to help grow the initiative (including making it easier to understand), it's been just me with a little help from friends and family so far, so I'm looking forward to creating some real jobs - which helps the local community even more.<br/><br/>We have lots of merchandise that you can purchase, from pens, torches and bags to limited edition digital Avatar's for the leader-board and tickets to amazing events we hold in the UK.<br/><br/><h3>The Impact</h3>
<br/>Without any funding, our prize funds can currently support:<br/><br/>- about 150 players per month who take a share of £5,000 in cash winnings every two months <br/>- £1,000 for local schools and charities every 6 months<br/>- about £50,000 for local independent business per month.<br/><br/>With the funding required, in 6 months time, our prize funds will support:<br/><br/>- Over 500 players per month, with a total combined winnings of £20,000 every two months<br/>- £6,000 for local schools and charities every 6 months<br/>- £200,000 revenue for local independent businesses per month<br/><br/>These figures will continue to grow and with your help by way of contribution, will grow even more.<br/><br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges </h3>
<p><br/></p>A risk is that we can't generate enough results for local independent businesses to justify enough contribution from them back into the scheme to sustain (and grow) the prize funds, this hasn't been a problem so far but it's up to all of us to create a buzz and demonstrate the community value, generosity and effectiveness of Local Puzzle.<br/><br/>Another risk is that it's all too complicated to understand or may seem to good to be true. This is a tough one, and whereas we make it more intuitive every day, until now we've let the results do the talking. Players find themselves winning easy prizes, which then motivates them to learn more about Local Puzzle and how to maximise there winnings. The businesses follow suit, they see more people spending in their shops and buzzing about Local Puzzle, this then gets their attention and we are then invited to explain more to them. <br/><br/>We go to extraordinary lengths to make sure the businesses only strengthens from being involved - the results are clear and transparent to them on their own Trade Dashboard and fundamentally, they have complete control without needing to lift a finger.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you can't donate us anything, don't worry, just spare some time to learn how to play Local Puzzle (it's free). You'll soon start winning some cash for your efforts and then you can choose to help fund us, or spend that money with a local independent business - in either case we all win.<br/>

Those with the most Puzzle Points share thousands of pounds in cash every two months. That's it.Every 6 months we give a donation to the school or charity with the more Puzzle Points you've scored, the bigger say you have in where that money goes.
Those who want to get more involved can top up their points by collecting Puzzle Codes, playing sliding puzzles, referring their friends, sponsoring their favourite businesses, trading in virtual shares and much more. There's a whole host of fun, the more you do, the more you'll win for yourself and your chosen school or charity (if you select one).
It's not luck, it's effort and cunning that will get you to the top.


Where Does The Money Come From?
Money comes into Local Puzzle from 3 revenue streams:
1) Contributions that the independent businesses choose to make in return for the extra customers they get;
2) Some of the players themselves choose to buy tickets to events, merchandise and other bits and pieces from us (they don't have too as Local Puzzle is free to play);
3) Other companies pay us fees to advertise their products and services to the independent businesses listed on the Local Puzzle Platform;



   What We Need & What You Get
This will sound strange, but Local Puzzle grows by giving away more money to it's players, local schools and charities. This then draws more money into local businesses who are then are happy to contribute back to the prize funds, creating a spiral of economic growth for the entire local community.Every £1 we give away currently generates £22 revenue for independent businesses.On top of the extra money we'll give away, we need to recruit a small team to help grow the initiative (including making it easier to understand), it's been just me with a little help from friends and family so far, so I'm looking forward to creating some real jobs - which helps the local community even more.We have lots of merchandise that you can purchase, from pens, torches and bags to limited edition digital Avatar's for the leader-board and tickets to amazing events we hold in the UK.The Impact
Without any funding, our prize funds can currently support:- about 150 players per month who take a share of £5,000 in cash winnings every two months - £1,000 for local schools and charities every 6 months- about £50,000 for local independent business per month.With the funding required, in 6 months time, our prize funds will support:- Over 500 players per month, with a total combined winnings of £20,000 every two months- £6,000 for local schools and charities every 6 months- £200,000 revenue for local independent businesses per monthThese figures will continue to grow and with your help by way of contribution, will grow even more.
  Risks & Challenges 
A risk is that we can't generate enough results for local independent businesses to justify enough contribution from them back into the scheme to sustain (and grow) the prize funds, this hasn't been a problem so far but it's up to all of us to create a buzz and demonstrate the community value, generosity and effectiveness of Local Puzzle.Another risk is that it's all too complicated to understand or may seem to good to be true. This is a tough one, and whereas we make it more intuitive every day, until now we've let the results do the talking. Players find themselves winning easy prizes, which then motivates them to learn more about Local Puzzle and how to maximise there winnings. The businesses follow suit, they see more people spending in their shops and buzzing about Local Puzzle, this then gets their attention and we are then invited to explain more to them. We go to extraordinary lengths to make sure the businesses only strengthens from being involved - the results are clear and transparent to them on their own Trade Dashboard and fundamentally, they have complete control without needing to lift a finger.
  Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't donate us anything, don't worry, just spare some time to learn how to play Local Puzzle (it's free). You'll soon start winning some cash for your efforts and then you can choose to help fund us, or spend that money with a local independent business - in either case we all win.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><a href=""www.facebook.com/betmanna.project"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""www.facebook.com/betmanna.project"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Betmanna</a> means ""I wish"" in dialectal Syrian
Arabic. The project's main goal is to provide displaced Syrian children with a
space for leisure and entertainment where they're encouraged to <b>express
themselves</b>, their wishes and experiences, through <b>art, writing and music</b>
workshops. By helping them put their own abilities to work and having fun at
the same time in a safe and supportive environment, we aim to brighten their
mood and boost their self-confidence, as well as help them learn new tools and
skills, paving the way towards <b>healing and empowerment</b>. </p>
<p>This initiative started a year ago with a campaign in
which Syrian children refugees in Reyhanli (Turkey), Cairo (Egypt) and Irbid
(Jordan) <b>exchanged letters</b>, drawings and wishes with <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.360434570802352.1073741837.295135637332246&amp;type=3"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>kids of different origins located in

<h3>Jordan. Summer
2015</h3>
<p>Since the
Syrian uprising began in 2011 in the city of Dar’aa, just a few kilometers away
from the border with Jordan, <span>thousands of refugees have fled to their neighboring countries, in an attempt to escape from the barrel bombs, persecution and poverty of the now four year-long war.</span><span> In Jordan, there are </span><a href=""http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=107"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">628.160 registered Syrian refugees</a> of which <b>more than half </b>are children. Some of
them live in refugee camps like the massive <a href=""http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/see-scale-zaatari-syrian-refugee-5072287"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Zaatari Camp</a>, some live in smaller illegal improvised camps scattered around the
countryside, and others are integrated in urban areas, sharing space with their
host communities. The access to education, let alone leisure activities, is
restricted (a study from CARE shows that <a href=""http://www.care.org/sites/default/files/documents/EMER-JOR-2013-Syrian-Refugees-in-Urban-Jordan.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">60% of school-age
children amongst urban refugees are not attending school</a>). Families are forced to watch their sons and
daughters languish in boredom at home, often overcrowded, with the weight of a
broken life, war and displacement on their shoulders. Facing desperation, an increasing number of families resort to negative
coping mechanisms, like early marriage of girls, or child labor in the case of
boys (according to an <a href=""http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---arabstates/---ro-beirut/documents/genericdocument/wcms_246207.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ILO report</a> around half of the households have one child working), with their
mothers taking care of younger siblings and their fathers deceased, absent or
disabled (UNHCR reports that <a href=""http://www.unhcr.org/54b685079.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">female-headed households represent one third of the refugee
population</a>). </p>
<p>As the conflict
and the displacement is prolonged, refugees’ vulnerability rises dramatically:
savings waste away, support networks decay, host communities grow more hostile,
and government resources and policies get more and more restrictive. </p>
<br/>
<h3>One Project,
Two Initiatives </h3>
<p>Betmanna is coming back to Jordan this summer to focus
on a new idea: new ways and tools to help children break the tedious routine,
open up <b>and allow them to express</b>
their emotions and aspirations for the future. At the same time working with
the community to <b>cover some of their
basic needs</b> in the face of almost total isolation and abandonment by public
and private institutions. </p>
<h4>1. ""Bring a Loudspeaker!""</h4>
<p>In almost every letter the children wrote last summer
they expressed their wishes for the future. The word ""betmanna"" (I
wish) was written all over. Then came the idea, why not <b>say it out loud</b>?
Because it is sometimes difficult to put our thoughts together and speak out,
why not encourage the flow of words, ideas and feelings <b>through music</b>?</p>
<p>Our specific goal for the summer 2015 is to allow the
kids to be creative and write their own songs or poems, help them to pass on
their message through singing, rapping or reciting. In other words, creating a
metaphorical loudspeaker and ensure that <b>their
voices are heard</b>. </p>
<p>With this in mind, we want to take it to the next
level:  <b>edit a video-clip</b> of the whole experience and use it as a mean
to reach even more people. The more we can invest in recording equipment (such
as video cameras and recording devices) the more the children will be able to
get involved in the learning and shooting of their own films. </p>
<p>We are all aware of the power of images. We are
determined to help the children reach out to the world, because they have
something important to say. </p>
<h4>2. ""Backpacks for Health ""</h4>
<p>As said before,
not all refugees in Jordan (or elsewhere) live in official governmental refugee
camps such as Zaatari or Azraq. Some live in urban areas and others set up
their own informal tented settlements (ITS) in the countryside. If refugees in
general lack of access to basic services, the situation in the ITS’s is even
worse, since they are pretty much isolated, leaving refugees on their own. In
addition to the lack of direct assistance, last November the Jordanian <a href=""http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/download.%20php?id=7762"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>authorities decided</span></a> that registered Syrian refugees can <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11261468/Jordan-repeals-free-medical-aid-for-Syrian-refugees.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>no longer access free health services</span></a>. </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>We
will be visiting a tent settlement in the Amman countryside</b> where we have
been witness to the <b>huge need for improved hygiene</b> for the children. In
order to do something about it, we plan to:</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Distribute <b>60 backpacks</b> containing a <b>basic
hygiene kit</b> for the kids.</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Carrying out <b>fun
activities about healthy habits</b> and hygiene with the children. </p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Doing a <b>needs
assessment workshop with the community</b> in order to promote a <b>sustainable way</b> to maintain the
improvements (self-production of hygienic products, use of traditional means…)</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Facilitate the <b>exchange
of techniques and products</b> with a women's project in Al Hoson Camp who
already sell their own gels and soaps. <br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What do we need
to make this possible</h3>
<p>Our grassroots project is run on a low budget in an
efficient way. Should donations exceed our starting financial goal, it will
simply allow us to expand the number of activities, the number of children we
can reach and use better quality materials. The money needed will directly finance
the activities with these approximate amounts: </p>
<ul>
<li>60 backpacks with hygiene kits--- (1200€) </li>
<li>4 cameras  --- (500€)</li>
<li>1 digital voice recorder --- (40€)</li>
<li>Daily healthy snacks for the kids (and lots of water!
As summer temperatures can be very high) --- (240€)</li>
<li>Stationery (Crayons, pencils, pens and paper) --- (30€)</li>
<li>Transportation expenses ---- (200€) </li>
<li>Crowfunding fees: 100€</li>
</ul><p><br/></p><h3><b>Who are we?</b></h3>

<h3><b>Jordania. Verano 2015</b></h3>
<p>Desde el inicio del levantamiento sirio en
2011, en la ciudad de Dar’aa, a muy pocos kilómetros de la frontera con
Jordania, miles de refugiados/as han huido a sus países vecinos, en un intento
de escapar de los barriles explosivos, la persecución y la pobreza de los ya
cuatro años de guerra. En Jordania hay en este momento <a href=""http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=107"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">628.160 personas
refugiadas sirias registradas</a>, de las cuales <b>más de la mitad son menores</b>. Algunas de ellas viven en campos
de refugiados masivos como <a href=""http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/see-scale-zaatari-syrian-refugee-5072287"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Zaatari</a>,
otras viven en campamentos más pequeños, ilegales e improvisados, repartidos
por las afueras de las ciudades, y otras están integradas en las áreas urbanas,
compartiendo el espacio con las comunidades de acogida. El <b>acceso a la educación</b>, por no decir a las actividades de ocio, es
restringido (un estudio de CARE muestra que <a href=""http://www.care.org/sites/default/files/documents/EMER-JOR-2013-Syrian-Refugees-in-Urban-Jordan.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">el
60% de los menores en edad escolar de entre los refugiados urbanos no van a la
escuela</a>). Las familias se ven forzadas a observar a sus hijos e hijas
languidecer en el aburrimiento, en casa, a menudo abarrotada, con el peso de una
vida rota, la guerra y el exilio sobre sus hombros. Ante la desesperación, un
número creciente de familias recurren a mecanismos de adaptación negativos,
como el <b>matrimonio temprano</b> de las
niñas, o el trabajo infantil en el caso de los chicos (según un <a href=""http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---arabstates/---ro-beirut/documents/genericdocument/wcms_246207.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">informe

<h3><b>Un Proyecto, Dos Iniciativas</b></h3>
<p>Betmanna vuelve a Jordania este verano con
una nueva idea: nuevas formas y herramientas que ayuden a los/as niños/as a
romper la tediosa rutina, abrirse y expresar sus emociones y aspiraciones para
el futuro. Al mismo tiempo, trabajaremos con la comunidad para cubrir algunas
de sus necesidades básicas frente al casi total aislamiento y abandono por
parte de las instituciones públicas y privadas. </p>
<h4><b><i>1. </i>“¡Trae un Altavoz!”</b></h4>
<p>En casi todas las cartas del año pasado,
los y las niñas expresaban deseos para el futuro. La palabra “betmanna” (yo
deseo/espero) aparecía por todas partes. Entonces vino la idea, ¿por qué no <b>decirlo bien alto</b>? Y ya que a veces nos
es difícil poner los pensamientos en orden y expresarlos, ¿por qué no promover
el flujo de ideas, palabras y sentimientos <b>a
través de la música</b>?</p>
<p>El objetivo en concreto para este verano
2015 es animar a los y las niñas a dejar volar su creatividad para que escriban
sus propias canciones o poemas, ayudarles a enviar su mensaje cantando,
rapeando o recitando. En otras palabras, crear un altavoz metafórico y
asegurarnos de <b>que sus voces sean
escuchadas</b>. </p>
<p>Con esto en mente, queremos llevarlo un
paso más allá: editar un <b>videoclip</b> de la experiencia y usarlo como medio para
llegar incluso a más gente. Cuanto más podamos invertir en aparatos de
grabación (como cámaras y grabadoras), más podremos <b>involucrar a los propios
niños/as</b> para que puedan aprender, filmarse y hacer sus propias grabaciones. </p>
<p>Todos conocemos el poder de una imagen.
Estamos decididos/as a que la voz de los niños/as llegue al exterior, porque
tienen algo importante que decir. </p>
<h4>2. “Mochilas de
Salud”</h4>
<p>Como se ha mencionado antes,
no todas las personas refugiadas en Jordania (o en otros lugares) viven en campamentos
de refugiados oficiales del gobierno, como Zaatari o Azraq. Algunas viven en
áreas urbanas y otras montan sus propios asentamientos informales en las
afueras. Si en general los y las refugiadas carecen de los servicios básicos,
la situación en estos campamentos informales es todavía peor, ya que están casi
totalmente aislados, dejados a su propia suerte. Además de la falta de
asistencia directa, el pasado noviembre las <a href=""http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/download.%20php?id=7762"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">autoridad
jordanas decidieron</a> que las
personas sirias refugiadas ya <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11261468/Jordan-repeals-free-medical-aid-for-Syrian-refugees.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">no
podrán acceder a los servicios de salud gratuitos.</a> </p>
<p><b>Visitaremos
uno de estos asentamientos</b> <b>a las afueras de Amman</b> en el cual hemos sido testigos de la
enorme <b>necesidad de mejorar la higiene</b> de los y las pequeñas. Para hacer
algo al respecto, queremos:</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Distribuir al menos <b>60 mochilas con un kit de higiene básico</b>
entre los niños/as.</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Realizar <b>dinámicas divertidas</b> <b>sobre hábitos saludables</b> e
higiene con los niños/as. </p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Llevar a cabo <b>un análisis de necesidades con la comunidad</b> con
tal de promover una manera <b>sostenible</b> de mantener las mejoras
(autoproducción de productos de higiene, uso de métodos tradicionales, etc.)</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Facilitar un<b> intercambio de técnicas y productos</b> con un proyecto
de mujeres del campamento de Al Hoson que venden sus propios geles y jabones. </p>
<h3><b>Qué necesitamos para hacerlo possible</b></h3>
<p>Nuestro proyecto de base comunitaria funciona con un bajo presupuesto
usado de manera eficiente. Si las donaciones excedieran nuestro objetivo
económico inicial, simplemente nos permitirá ampliar el número de actividades,
el número de niños/as al que lleguemos y el uso de materiales de mejor calidad.

<p><b>Betmanna</b></p><p><b>""</b><b>ماهو مشروع""</b></p>
<p>الهدف الرئيسي للمشروع هو توفير مساحة للترفيه و التسلية للأطفال المشردين
السوريين و ذلك<span>  لتشجيعهم على التعبير عن أنفسهم،  و رغباتهم و مختلف تجاربهم، من خلال ورش عمل فنية
تشمل الفن  الكتابة والموسيقى. من خلال مساعدتهم
على وضع قدراتهم في العمل واستغلال الوقت في بيئة آمنة وداعمة، ونحن نهدف إلى سطع مزاجهم
وتعزيز الثقة بالنفس، وكذلك مساعدتهم على تعلم أدوات ومهارات جديدة، مما يمهد الطريق
نحو الشفاء والتمكين</span><span> 
</span></p>
<p>بدأت هذه المبادرة قبل عام مع حملة تبادل فيها الأطفال السوريين اللاجئين
في ريحانلى (تركيا)، القاهرة (مصر) وإربد (الأردن) رسائل ورسومات وأمنيات مع أطفال
من أصول مختلفة تقع في اسبانيا .</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>
</p><p><span>سيستمر التبادل هذا العام، لان الخطابات مازالت تتدفق ذهابا وإيابا، ولكن
هذا الصيف سوف تتوسع أنشطتنا وتشمل أنواع جديدة من ورش العمل لمساعدة الأطفال من اجل<span>  تعبير أفضل عن مشاعرهم وآمالهم ونضالاتهم  و مختلف تجاربهم. هذا العام التركيز الجديد سيكون
على الموسيقى والفيديو .</span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>الأردن. صيف 2015</b></p>
<p>منذ بدء الانتفاضة السورية في عام 2011 من<span>  مدينة</span>على بعد بضعة كيلومترات بعيدا عن الحدود مع الأردن، فر الآلاف اللاجئين درعا
إلى البلدان المجاورة لها، في محاولة للهرب من القصف و التفجيرات والاضطهاد والفقر
,مضى على<span>  الحرب أربعة سنوات طويلة.يوجد الآن  في الأردنما يقارب ال 628،160 لاجئ سوري مسجل أكثر
من نصفهم من الأطفال. البعض منهم يعيشون في مخيمات للاجئين مثل مخيم الزعتري ، ويعيش
بعضهم في مخيمات صغيرة غير قانونية منتشرة في جميع أنحاء الريف، ويتواجد الآخرون  في المناطق الحضرية، ويتقاسمون الفضاء مع المجتمعات
المضيفة لهم. الحصول على التعليم، و للأنشطة الترفيهية غير ، متوفران . أكثر من  60٪ من الأطفال في سن المدرسة في أوساط اللاجئين
في المناطق الحضرية لا يذهبون إلى المدرسة. يضطر الأهالي لمشاهدة أبنائهم وبناتهم يقبعون
في المنازل، غالبا ما تكون مكتظة، مع مآسي الحرب والتهجير التي يحملونها على أكتافهم.
مع هذا  اليأس، فإن عددا متزايدا من الأسر تلجأ
إلى آليات التكيف السلبية، مثل الزواج المبكر للفتيات، أو عمالة الأطفال  في حالة الفتيان (وفقا لتقرير صادر عن منظمة العمل
الدولية ما يقرب من نصف الأسر لديها طفل واحد يعمل)، مع أمهاتهم مع الحرص من الأشقاء
الأصغر سنا وآبائهم المتوفين، أو المعوقين (تقارير المفوضية أن الأسر التي ترأسها إناث
تمثل ثلث السكان اللاجئين) .</span></p>
<p>كما طال أمد الصراع والنزوح، ويرتفع ضعف اللاجئين بشكل كبير: وتسوس شبكات
الدعم، تنمو المجتمعات المضيفة بأكثر عدائية، والموارد والسياسات الحكومية تفرض المزيد
من القيود .</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>مشروع واحد، مبادرتين</b></p>
<p>""بتمنى ""يعود إلى الأردن هذا الصيف بهدف<span>  التركيز على فكرة جديدة: وهي الاعتماد على وسائل
وأدوات جديدة لمساعدة الأطفال على كسر الروتين الممل، والسماح لهم بالتعبير عن مشاعرهم
وتطلعاتهم للمستقبل. في الوقت نفسه العمل مع المجتمع المدني  لتغطية بعض احتياجاتهم الأساسية في مواجهة العزلة
شبه التامة ، وإهمال شبه كلي من جميع المؤسسات العامة والخاصة .</span></p>
<p><b>""</b><b>إحضار مكبر
الصوت</b><b>!""</b></p>
<p><span>  في كل حرف تقريبا كتبه الأطفال
في الصيف الماضي وأعربوا عن أمنياتهم في المستقبل تم كتابة  أتمنى في كل 
مكان من هنا جاءت الفكرة، لماذا لا نقول ذلك بصوت عال؟ لأنه من الصعب في بعض
الأحيان تجميع أفكارنا كلها والتحدث بها، لماذا لا نشجع على تدفق الكلمات والأفكار
والمشاعر من خلال الموسيقى؟</span></p>
<p>لدينا هدف محدد لصيف 2015 هو دعم أفكار الأطفال لتكون خلاقة أكثر و حثهم على
كتابة الأغاني الخاصة أو القصائد، ومساعدتهم على نقل رسالتهم من خلال الغناء، وموسيقى
الراب أو القراءة. وبعبارة أخرى خلق مكبر صوت مجازي و ذلك لضمان سماع أصواتهم .</p>
<p>مع الأخذ بعين الاعتبار، نحن نريد أن تأخذه إلى المستوى التالي: انجاز فيديو
كليب من التجربة برمتها واستخدامها كوسيلة للوصول إلى عدد أكبر من الناس. كلما زادت
قدرتنا على الاستثمار في معدات التسجيل (مثل كاميرات الفيديو وأجهزة التسجيل) أكثر
فإن الأطفال سوف تكون لهم القدرة على المشاركة في التعلم وتصوير أفلامهم الخاصة .</p>
<p>نحن جميعا ندرك قوة تأثير الصور. نحن عازمون على مساعدة الأطفال لتصل أصواتهم
إلى العالم، لأن لديهم شيء في غاية الأهمية يخبرونا عنه . </p>
<p><b>""</b><b>حقائب تحمل
على الظهر من أجل الصحة</b><b>""</b></p>
<p>كما ذكرت من قبل، لا يعيش جميع اللاجئين في الأردن (أو أي مكان آخر) في مخيمات
اللاجئين الحكومية الرسمية مثل الزعتري. يعيش العديد منهم في الريف و المناطق الحضرية
عن طريق اقامة خيام غير رسمية خاصة بهم و التي تعتبر سيئة جدا حيث انها معزولة الى
حد كبير و تعاني من نقص الخدمات الاساسية و الصحية التي تؤثر على النظافة العامة و
الشخصية . </p>
<p><span>  لذلك سنقوم بزيارة لتسوية خيمة في
ريف عمان حيث كنا شهودا على حاجة كبيرة لتحسين النظافة للأطفال. من أجل القيام بشيء
حيال ذلك، ونحن نخطط *لتوزيع 60 حقيبة ظهر تحتوي على عدة النظافة الأساسية للأطفال
. *القيام بأنشطة ممتعة حول المعدات الصحية والنظافة مع الأطفال .* ممارسة ورشة عمل

(الإنتاج الذاتي من المنتجات الصحية، واستخدام الوسائل التقليدية) . تسهيل تبادل التقنيات
والمنتجات مع مشروع نسائي في ملجئ مدينة الحصن حيث يصنعون مواد صحية  الخاصة بهم مثل الصابون .</span></p>

What is the Betmanna Project?
Betmanna means ""I wish"" in dialectal Syrian
Arabic. The project's main goal is to provide displaced Syrian children with a
space for leisure and entertainment where they're encouraged to express
themselves, their wishes and experiences, through art, writing and music
workshops. By helping them put their own abilities to work and having fun at
the same time in a safe and supportive environment, we aim to brighten their
mood and boost their self-confidence, as well as help them learn new tools and
skills, paving the way towards healing and empowerment. 
This initiative started a year ago with a campaign in
which Syrian children refugees in Reyhanli (Turkey), Cairo (Egypt) and Irbid
(Jordan) exchanged letters, drawings and wishes with kids of different origins located in
Spain. 
                                                   
The exchange will continue this year, since the letters are still
flowing back and forth, but this summer we will extend our activities and
include new types of workshops to help better express their feelings,
hopes, struggles and experiences of Syrian children. This year the new focus
will be on Music and Video.     
Jordan. Summer
2015
Since the
Syrian uprising began in 2011 in the city of Dar’aa, just a few kilometers away
from the border with Jordan, thousands of refugees have fled to their neighboring countries, in an attempt to escape from the barrel bombs, persecution and poverty of the now four year-long war. In Jordan, there are 628.160 registered Syrian refugees of which more than half are children. Some of
them live in refugee camps like the massive Zaatari Camp, some live in smaller illegal improvised camps scattered around the
countryside, and others are integrated in urban areas, sharing space with their
host communities. The access to education, let alone leisure activities, is
restricted (a study from CARE shows that 60% of school-age
children amongst urban refugees are not attending school). Families are forced to watch their sons and
daughters languish in boredom at home, often overcrowded, with the weight of a
broken life, war and displacement on their shoulders. Facing desperation, an increasing number of families resort to negative
coping mechanisms, like early marriage of girls, or child labor in the case of
boys (according to an ILO report around half of the households have one child working), with their
mothers taking care of younger siblings and their fathers deceased, absent or
disabled (UNHCR reports that female-headed households represent one third of the refugee
population). 
As the conflict
and the displacement is prolonged, refugees’ vulnerability rises dramatically:
savings waste away, support networks decay, host communities grow more hostile,
and government resources and policies get more and more restrictive. 

One Project,
Two Initiatives 
Betmanna is coming back to Jordan this summer to focus
on a new idea: new ways and tools to help children break the tedious routine,
open up and allow them to express
their emotions and aspirations for the future. At the same time working with
the community to cover some of their
basic needs in the face of almost total isolation and abandonment by public
and private institutions. 
1. ""Bring a Loudspeaker!""
In almost every letter the children wrote last summer
they expressed their wishes for the future. The word ""betmanna"" (I
wish) was written all over. Then came the idea, why not say it out loud?
Because it is sometimes difficult to put our thoughts together and speak out,
why not encourage the flow of words, ideas and feelings through music?
Our specific goal for the summer 2015 is to allow the
kids to be creative and write their own songs or poems, help them to pass on
their message through singing, rapping or reciting. In other words, creating a
metaphorical loudspeaker and ensure that their
voices are heard. 
With this in mind, we want to take it to the next
level:  edit a video-clip of the whole experience and use it as a mean
to reach even more people. The more we can invest in recording equipment (such
as video cameras and recording devices) the more the children will be able to
get involved in the learning and shooting of their own films. 
We are all aware of the power of images. We are
determined to help the children reach out to the world, because they have
something important to say. 
2. ""Backpacks for Health ""
As said before,
not all refugees in Jordan (or elsewhere) live in official governmental refugee
camps such as Zaatari or Azraq. Some live in urban areas and others set up
their own informal tented settlements (ITS) in the countryside. If refugees in
general lack of access to basic services, the situation in the ITS’s is even
worse, since they are pretty much isolated, leaving refugees on their own. In
addition to the lack of direct assistance, last November the Jordanian authorities decided that registered Syrian refugees can no longer access free health services. 

We
will be visiting a tent settlement in the Amman countryside where we have
been witness to the huge need for improved hygiene for the children. In
order to do something about it, we plan to:
- 
Distribute 60 backpacks containing a basic
hygiene kit for the kids.
- 
Carrying out fun
activities about healthy habits and hygiene with the children. 
- 
Doing a needs
assessment workshop with the community in order to promote a sustainable way to maintain the
improvements (self-production of hygienic products, use of traditional means…)
- 
Facilitate the exchange
of techniques and products with a women's project in Al Hoson Camp who
already sell their own gels and soaps. 

What do we need
to make this possible
Our grassroots project is run on a low budget in an
efficient way. Should donations exceed our starting financial goal, it will
simply allow us to expand the number of activities, the number of children we
can reach and use better quality materials. The money needed will directly finance
the activities with these approximate amounts: 

60 backpacks with hygiene kits--- (1200€) 
4 cameras  --- (500€)
1 digital voice recorder --- (40€)
Daily healthy snacks for the kids (and lots of water!
As summer temperatures can be very high) --- (240€)
Stationery (Crayons, pencils, pens and paper) --- (30€)
Transportation expenses ---- (200€) 
Crowfunding fees: 100€
Who are we?
My name is Elisa and I’m a psychologist and educator
specializing in the mental health of refugees, migrants and minorities. I
coordinate a local project in Barcelona with children at risk, and I’m also an
activist with Global Solidarity with the Syrian Revolution and as a citizen of
the world concerned about human rights and popular movements for freedom and
dignity. 
While carrying on the Betmanna project in Irbid in the
summer of 2014, I had the honor to meet Nada, Luna and Eman, three amazing young Syrian-Iraqi
sisters, volunteers and community leaders. This project has been thought through
and designed hand in hand with them, and they are as responsible as I in
conducting the activities on the ground, with the help of the Aahed Group’s
volunteers.                   Eman                              Elisa                                   Nada    &    Luna
Aahed Group
Aahed Group is a non-profit association made
up of young students who volunteer and provide a variety of services and
activities for displaced Syrian families in Jordan. Many of the volunteers are
themselves Syrians or of Syrian descent, and they are very dedicated to helping
their own people, both children and adults. They aim to cover their basic needs
through different projects focusing on health, education, children’s rights,
labor, etc                                    During and After the Campaign
Since we know the children will create wonderful things out of these activities, we will keep you posted constantly through our website/social media. Follow us on our facebook page and see what your donations are contributing to! We will also attach a financial report in our website, to show you in details and with full transparency how the money was spent.THANKS A LOT! :)Special thanks to,Companies and organizations that have contributed so far: ---------------------------------CASTELLANO
¿Qué es el Proyecto Betmanna?
Betmanna significa “Yo
deseo” en árabe dialectal sirio. El principal objetivo del proyecto es dotar a
los niños y niñas sirios desplazados de un espacio de ocio y entretenimiento,
donde se les anima a expresarse, sus
deseos y experiencias, a través del arte,
la escritura y la música. Al ayudarles a utilizar sus propias habilidades,
divirtiéndose al mismo tiempo en un ambiente seguro y de apoyo, pretendemos
mejorar su estado de animo y aumentar su confianza, a la vez que ayudarles a
aprender nuevas herramientas y habilidades, allanando el camino hacia la curación y el empoderamiento. 
Esta iniciativa comienza hace un año con
una campaña de intercambio de cartas,
dibujos y deseos entre niños/as refugiados/as de Siria en Reyhanli
(Turquía), Cairo (Egipto) e Irbid (Jordania) y niños/as
de origen diverso en España. 
                
El intercambio continuará este año, ya que
las cartas siguen circulando entre unos/as y otros/as, pero este verano
ampliaremos nuestras actividades para incluir nuevos tipos de talleres que ayuden a expresar aún mejor los
sentimientos, esperanzas, luchas y experiencias de la infancia siria. Este año
el nuevo foco lo pondremos en la Música
y el Video. 
Jordania. Verano 2015
Desde el inicio del levantamiento sirio en
2011, en la ciudad de Dar’aa, a muy pocos kilómetros de la frontera con
Jordania, miles de refugiados/as han huido a sus países vecinos, en un intento
de escapar de los barriles explosivos, la persecución y la pobreza de los ya
cuatro años de guerra. En Jordania hay en este momento 628.160 personas
refugiadas sirias registradas, de las cuales más de la mitad son menores. Algunas de ellas viven en campos
de refugiados masivos como Zaatari,
otras viven en campamentos más pequeños, ilegales e improvisados, repartidos
por las afueras de las ciudades, y otras están integradas en las áreas urbanas,
compartiendo el espacio con las comunidades de acogida. El acceso a la educación, por no decir a las actividades de ocio, es
restringido (un estudio de CARE muestra que el
60% de los menores en edad escolar de entre los refugiados urbanos no van a la
escuela). Las familias se ven forzadas a observar a sus hijos e hijas
languidecer en el aburrimiento, en casa, a menudo abarrotada, con el peso de una
vida rota, la guerra y el exilio sobre sus hombros. Ante la desesperación, un
número creciente de familias recurren a mecanismos de adaptación negativos,
como el matrimonio temprano de las
niñas, o el trabajo infantil en el caso de los chicos (según un informe
de la OIT, en alrededor de la mitad de
los hogares hay un niño que trabaja), con sus madres a cargo de hermanos/as
pequeños/as y sus padres fallecidos, ausentes o discapacitados (Naciones Unidas
informa que los hogares
monoparentales encabezados por mujeres representan un tercio de la población
refugiada).
A medida que el conflicto y el exilio se
prolonga, la vulnerabilidad de las personas refugiadas crece de forma
dramática: los ahorros se agotan, las redes de apoyo se desgastan, las
comunidades de acogida se vuelven más hostiles y los recursos y políticas del
gobierno son cada vez más restrictivas. 
Un Proyecto, Dos Iniciativas
Betmanna vuelve a Jordania este verano con
una nueva idea: nuevas formas y herramientas que ayuden a los/as niños/as a
romper la tediosa rutina, abrirse y expresar sus emociones y aspiraciones para
el futuro. Al mismo tiempo, trabajaremos con la comunidad para cubrir algunas
de sus necesidades básicas frente al casi total aislamiento y abandono por
parte de las instituciones públicas y privadas. 
1. “¡Trae un Altavoz!”
En casi todas las cartas del año pasado,
los y las niñas expresaban deseos para el futuro. La palabra “betmanna” (yo
deseo/espero) aparecía por todas partes. Entonces vino la idea, ¿por qué no decirlo bien alto? Y ya que a veces nos
es difícil poner los pensamientos en orden y expresarlos, ¿por qué no promover
el flujo de ideas, palabras y sentimientos a
través de la música?
El objetivo en concreto para este verano
2015 es animar a los y las niñas a dejar volar su creatividad para que escriban
sus propias canciones o poemas, ayudarles a enviar su mensaje cantando,
rapeando o recitando. En otras palabras, crear un altavoz metafórico y
asegurarnos de que sus voces sean
escuchadas. 
Con esto en mente, queremos llevarlo un
paso más allá: editar un videoclip de la experiencia y usarlo como medio para
llegar incluso a más gente. Cuanto más podamos invertir en aparatos de
grabación (como cámaras y grabadoras), más podremos involucrar a los propios
niños/as para que puedan aprender, filmarse y hacer sus propias grabaciones. 
Todos conocemos el poder de una imagen.
Estamos decididos/as a que la voz de los niños/as llegue al exterior, porque
tienen algo importante que decir. 
2. “Mochilas de
Salud”
Como se ha mencionado antes,
no todas las personas refugiadas en Jordania (o en otros lugares) viven en campamentos
de refugiados oficiales del gobierno, como Zaatari o Azraq. Algunas viven en
áreas urbanas y otras montan sus propios asentamientos informales en las
afueras. Si en general los y las refugiadas carecen de los servicios básicos,
la situación en estos campamentos informales es todavía peor, ya que están casi
totalmente aislados, dejados a su propia suerte. Además de la falta de
asistencia directa, el pasado noviembre las autoridad
jordanas decidieron que las
personas sirias refugiadas ya no
podrán acceder a los servicios de salud gratuitos. 
Visitaremos
uno de estos asentamientos a las afueras de Amman en el cual hemos sido testigos de la
enorme necesidad de mejorar la higiene de los y las pequeñas. Para hacer
algo al respecto, queremos:
- 
Distribuir al menos 60 mochilas con un kit de higiene básico
entre los niños/as.
- 
Realizar dinámicas divertidas sobre hábitos saludables e
higiene con los niños/as. 
- 
Llevar a cabo un análisis de necesidades con la comunidad con
tal de promover una manera sostenible de mantener las mejoras
(autoproducción de productos de higiene, uso de métodos tradicionales, etc.)
- 
Facilitar un intercambio de técnicas y productos con un proyecto
de mujeres del campamento de Al Hoson que venden sus propios geles y jabones. 
Qué necesitamos para hacerlo possible
Nuestro proyecto de base comunitaria funciona con un bajo presupuesto
usado de manera eficiente. Si las donaciones excedieran nuestro objetivo
económico inicial, simplemente nos permitirá ampliar el número de actividades,
el número de niños/as al que lleguemos y el uso de materiales de mejor calidad.
El dinero solicitado irá íntegramente a financiar las actividades en las
siguientes cantidades aproximadas: 


60 mochiles con kits higiénicos --- (1200€)

4 cámaras --- (500€)

1 grabadora de voz digital --- (40€)

Aperitivos diarios sanos para los/as niños/as (y mucho agua! Las
temperaturas estivales pueden ser muy altas) --- (240€)

Gastos de transporte --- (200€)

Tasas del micromecenazgo (100€)

Quiénes Somos
Mi nombre es Elisa y soy psicóloga y educadora, especializada en salud

con infancia en riesgo, y también soy activista con Solidaridad Global con la
Revolución Siria y como ciudadana del mundo preocupada por los derechos
humanos y los movimientos populares por la libertad y la dignidad. 
Mientras llevaba a cabo el proyecto Betmanna en Irbid, el verano de
2014, tuve el honor de conocer a tres increíbles hermanas sirio-iraquíes,
voluntarias y líderes en su comunidad. Este proyecto ha sido pensado y diseñado
mano a mano con ellas y son tan responsables como yo de conducir las
actividades sobre el terreno, con la ayuda de los voluntarios del Grupo Aahed. 
Grupo Aahed

asociación sin ánimo de lucro formada por jóvenes estudiantes que trabajan de
manera voluntaria para proveer diferentes servicios y actividades para las
familias sirias en Jordania. Muchos y muchas de las voluntarias son también de
origen sirio, y están comprometidos a ayudar a su gente, tanto niños/as como
adultos. Su objetivo es cubrir sus necesidades básicas a través de diferentes
proyectos en diferentes áreas: sanidad, educación, derechos de la infancia,
trabajo, etc. 
Durante y Después de la Campaña
Ya que sabemos que los niños/as crearan cosas estupendas fruto de estas
actividades, os mantendremos informados constantemente a través de las redes
sociales. ¡Seguidnos en nuestra página de facebook para ver
a lo que contribuyen vuestras donaciones! También subiremos un informe
económico a nuestra página, para mostrar en detalle y con total transparencia
cómo el dinero ha sido invertido. 

¡MUCHAS GRACIAS! :)

Betmanna""ماهو مشروع""
الهدف الرئيسي للمشروع هو توفير مساحة للترفيه و التسلية للأطفال المشردين
السوريين و ذلك  لتشجيعهم على التعبير عن أنفسهم،  و رغباتهم و مختلف تجاربهم، من خلال ورش عمل فنية
تشمل الفن  الكتابة والموسيقى. من خلال مساعدتهم
على وضع قدراتهم في العمل واستغلال الوقت في بيئة آمنة وداعمة، ونحن نهدف إلى سطع مزاجهم
وتعزيز الثقة بالنفس، وكذلك مساعدتهم على تعلم أدوات ومهارات جديدة، مما يمهد الطريق
نحو الشفاء والتمكين 

بدأت هذه المبادرة قبل عام مع حملة تبادل فيها الأطفال السوريين اللاجئين
في ريحانلى (تركيا)، القاهرة (مصر) وإربد (الأردن) رسائل ورسومات وأمنيات مع أطفال
من أصول مختلفة تقع في اسبانيا .

سيستمر التبادل هذا العام، لان الخطابات مازالت تتدفق ذهابا وإيابا، ولكن
هذا الصيف سوف تتوسع أنشطتنا وتشمل أنواع جديدة من ورش العمل لمساعدة الأطفال من اجل  تعبير أفضل عن مشاعرهم وآمالهم ونضالاتهم  و مختلف تجاربهم. هذا العام التركيز الجديد سيكون
على الموسيقى والفيديو .

الأردن. صيف 2015
منذ بدء الانتفاضة السورية في عام 2011 من  مدينةعلى بعد بضعة كيلومترات بعيدا عن الحدود مع الأردن، فر الآلاف اللاجئين درعا
إلى البلدان المجاورة لها، في محاولة للهرب من القصف و التفجيرات والاضطهاد والفقر
,مضى على  الحرب أربعة سنوات طويلة.يوجد الآن  في الأردنما يقارب ال 628،160 لاجئ سوري مسجل أكثر
من نصفهم من الأطفال. البعض منهم يعيشون في مخيمات للاجئين مثل مخيم الزعتري ، ويعيش
بعضهم في مخيمات صغيرة غير قانونية منتشرة في جميع أنحاء الريف، ويتواجد الآخرون  في المناطق الحضرية، ويتقاسمون الفضاء مع المجتمعات
المضيفة لهم. الحصول على التعليم، و للأنشطة الترفيهية غير ، متوفران . أكثر من  60٪ من الأطفال في سن المدرسة في أوساط اللاجئين
في المناطق الحضرية لا يذهبون إلى المدرسة. يضطر الأهالي لمشاهدة أبنائهم وبناتهم يقبعون
في المنازل، غالبا ما تكون مكتظة، مع مآسي الحرب والتهجير التي يحملونها على أكتافهم.
مع هذا  اليأس، فإن عددا متزايدا من الأسر تلجأ
إلى آليات التكيف السلبية، مثل الزواج المبكر للفتيات، أو عمالة الأطفال  في حالة الفتيان (وفقا لتقرير صادر عن منظمة العمل
الدولية ما يقرب من نصف الأسر لديها طفل واحد يعمل)، مع أمهاتهم مع الحرص من الأشقاء
الأصغر سنا وآبائهم المتوفين، أو المعوقين (تقارير المفوضية أن الأسر التي ترأسها إناث
تمثل ثلث السكان اللاجئين) .
كما طال أمد الصراع والنزوح، ويرتفع ضعف اللاجئين بشكل كبير: وتسوس شبكات
الدعم، تنمو المجتمعات المضيفة بأكثر عدائية، والموارد والسياسات الحكومية تفرض المزيد
من القيود .

مشروع واحد، مبادرتين
""بتمنى ""يعود إلى الأردن هذا الصيف بهدف  التركيز على فكرة جديدة: وهي الاعتماد على وسائل
وأدوات جديدة لمساعدة الأطفال على كسر الروتين الممل، والسماح لهم بالتعبير عن مشاعرهم
وتطلعاتهم للمستقبل. في الوقت نفسه العمل مع المجتمع المدني  لتغطية بعض احتياجاتهم الأساسية في مواجهة العزلة
شبه التامة ، وإهمال شبه كلي من جميع المؤسسات العامة والخاصة .
""إحضار مكبر
الصوت!""
  في كل حرف تقريبا كتبه الأطفال
في الصيف الماضي وأعربوا عن أمنياتهم في المستقبل تم كتابة  أتمنى في كل 
مكان من هنا جاءت الفكرة، لماذا لا نقول ذلك بصوت عال؟ لأنه من الصعب في بعض
الأحيان تجميع أفكارنا كلها والتحدث بها، لماذا لا نشجع على تدفق الكلمات والأفكار
والمشاعر من خلال الموسيقى؟
لدينا هدف محدد لصيف 2015 هو دعم أفكار الأطفال لتكون خلاقة أكثر و حثهم على
كتابة الأغاني الخاصة أو القصائد، ومساعدتهم على نقل رسالتهم من خلال الغناء، وموسيقى
الراب أو القراءة. وبعبارة أخرى خلق مكبر صوت مجازي و ذلك لضمان سماع أصواتهم .
مع الأخذ بعين الاعتبار، نحن نريد أن تأخذه إلى المستوى التالي: انجاز فيديو
كليب من التجربة برمتها واستخدامها كوسيلة للوصول إلى عدد أكبر من الناس. كلما زادت
قدرتنا على الاستثمار في معدات التسجيل (مثل كاميرات الفيديو وأجهزة التسجيل) أكثر
فإن الأطفال سوف تكون لهم القدرة على المشاركة في التعلم وتصوير أفلامهم الخاصة .
نحن جميعا ندرك قوة تأثير الصور. نحن عازمون على مساعدة الأطفال لتصل أصواتهم
إلى العالم، لأن لديهم شيء في غاية الأهمية يخبرونا عنه . 
""حقائب تحمل
على الظهر من أجل الصحة""
كما ذكرت من قبل، لا يعيش جميع اللاجئين في الأردن (أو أي مكان آخر) في مخيمات
اللاجئين الحكومية الرسمية مثل الزعتري. يعيش العديد منهم في الريف و المناطق الحضرية
عن طريق اقامة خيام غير رسمية خاصة بهم و التي تعتبر سيئة جدا حيث انها معزولة الى
حد كبير و تعاني من نقص الخدمات الاساسية و الصحية التي تؤثر على النظافة العامة و
الشخصية . 
  لذلك سنقوم بزيارة لتسوية خيمة في
ريف عمان حيث كنا شهودا على حاجة كبيرة لتحسين النظافة للأطفال. من أجل القيام بشيء
حيال ذلك، ونحن نخطط *لتوزيع 60 حقيبة ظهر تحتوي على عدة النظافة الأساسية للأطفال
. *القيام بأنشطة ممتعة حول المعدات الصحية والنظافة مع الأطفال .* ممارسة ورشة عمل
لتقييم الاحتياجات مع المجتمع من أجل التعزيز بطريقة مستديمة للحفاظ على التحسينات
(الإنتاج الذاتي من المنتجات الصحية، واستخدام الوسائل التقليدية) . تسهيل تبادل التقنيات
والمنتجات مع مشروع نسائي في ملجئ مدينة الحصن حيث يصنعون مواد صحية  الخاصة بهم مثل الصابون .
ماذا نحن بحاجة إليه لتحقيق هذا
المشروع
يتم تشغيل مشروعنا الشعبي وفق ميزانية منخفضة بطريقة فعالة. يجب أن تتجاوز
التبرعات هدفنا المالي ابتداء، فإنه سيسمح لنا ببساطة لتوسيع عدد من الأنشطة، و أكثر
عدد ممكن من الأطفال  واستخدام مواد ذات جودة
أفضل. 
المواد المستلزمة مرفقة
بالأسعار : 
  60 حقيبة ظهر مع مجموعة من مستلزمات
النظافة  1200 
كاميرات  5004
الصوتي الرقمي 401
• وجبات خفيفة صحية يومية للأطفال (والكثير من الماء! فدرجات الحرارة في الصيف
يمكن أن تكون عالية جدا) 240
• قرطاسيه (الطباشير وأقلام الرصاص والأقلام والورق) 30
• نفقات النقل 200
• 100رسو
من نحن؟
اسمي إليسا وأنا طبيبة نفسانية ومربية متخصصة في الصحة العقلية للاجئين والمهاجرين
والأقليات المتعرضة للخطر، وأنا أيضا الناشطة العالمية  المتضامنة مع الثورة السورية وكمواطن من العالم
قلقة بشأن حقوق الإنسان والحركات الشعبية من أجل الحرية والكرامة .
حيث عملنا سوية على  المشروعفي اربد في صيف عام 2014، كان لي شرف لقاء
ندى، لونا وإيمان، ثلاثة شابات أخوات من مع مجموعة من المتطوعين وقادة المجتمع و ذلك
بمساعدة مجموعة عهد . 

موسسة عهد 
مؤسسة عهد هي  جمعية غير ربحية تتألف
من الطلاب الشباب الذين يتطوعون لتوفير مجموعة متنوعة من الخدمات والأنشطة للأسر السورية
النازحة في الأردن. العديد من المتطوعين هم أنفسهم السوريين أو من أصل سوري، وهم حريصون
جدا لمساعدة الناس والأطفال والكبار على حد سواء. أنها تهدف لتغطية احتياجاتهم الأساسية
من خلال المشاريع المختلفة التي تركز على الصحة والتعليم، وحقوق الطفل، والعمل، الخ...
أثناء وبعد الحملة
لأننا نعلم أن الأطفال  باستطاعتهم
خلق أشياء رائعة من هذه الأنشطة، سوف ننشر لكم باستمرار من خلال موقعنا على الانترنت
/ وسائل الإعلام الاجتماعية. تابعونا على صفحتنا على  الفيسبوك لمعرفة نتائج و آثار تبرعاتكم ونحن أيضا
سنقوم  بإرفاق التقرير المالي في موقعنا، لنظهر

I have already acquired several small stills and much of the equipment needed to open a Craft-distillery, but with the help of the community we will be able to possibly purchase a larger still and thus have a greater production capacity when we open.The ImpactThe opening of the distillery will be the fulfillment of a dream for me personally as I have always wanted to create something that would reach people, plus Rum is Fun! It will also add a new type of attraction to Thornton.
There is not another distillery on the I-80 corridor between Joliet and the city of Chicago.
As a project manager, I know how to build it and as a bartender I know how to make it a luxurious, enjoyable, and relaxing space where you can sit back and enjoy a one of a kind small-batch craft spirit.
It will be a great place to visit and learn the process of how spirits are produced. Whether you’re a resident or in town for business or pleasure!
Here's where we are:We've been working for the last year to get us to where we are today. We have a location selected, the purchase agreement has been signed, architecture and construction drawings are in the works, recipe flavor development is ongoing using store bought products, and all the key equipment has been sourced, quoted and pending order. We are starting the capital campaign to get interest in the project as well as raise funds. Please remember, this is a true start-up small business in a tough industry and I am relying on family, friends and YOU.Risks & ChallengesThe most difficult part of starting a distillery is the requirement that you lease space, build, purchase equipment and get inspected locally before you can even begin the application process for the license. And that process can take several months to complete.
We have been truly fortunate to find a municipality that supports our efforts and wants the project to succeed. Thornton has acted as a true business partner helping to get the project to this phase.
We have enlisted a local architect to ensure that my build-out meets the local requirements as well as the state and federal requirements.
We have secured the services of a former TTB official to consult on the application and provide guidance from the start of the process until we can produce legally.

<h1><b>Who are we?</b></h1>
<p>Gratis Labs is one of the major new players in the telecommunications industry. The company was specifically formed to offer innovative telecommunications solutions to the most frequent problems phone service users encounter, as defined and specified by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The team at the core of the enterprise is made up of telecom and software engineers with decades of combined experience in telecommunications research and development, network integration, network operations and maintenance and large-scale project management. The company’s directors have worked on projects for American and European telecom giants. </p>
<h1><b>About this project</b></h1>
<p>The Gratis project has been specifically designed and created to bring an all-encompassing telecommunications solution to the global market. Gratis is not just the “next generation” communications application to come onto the market. Rather, Gratis will undoubtedly be the market leader which changes the way people communicate…forever!</p>
<p>The following issues have been highlighted by the FCC as the most common problems faced by pre-paid phone card users (see this link for details: <a href=""https://www.fcc.gov/document/pre-paid-phone-cards-tip-sheet"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.fcc.gov/document/pre-paid-phone-cards-tip-sheet</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Access numbers and/or PINs that don't work</li>
<li>Service or access numbers that are always busy</li>
<li>Card issuers going out of business, leaving people with useless cards and no means by which they can claim a refund</li>
<li>Rates that are higher – and often considerably higher – than advertised </li>
<li>Imposition of mysterious and undisclosed ""post-call"" fees, which service providers deduct after the user completes a call</li>
<li>Imposition of even more mysterious and undisclosed ""maintenance"" fees, which the service providers deduct either after a call or at regular intervals</li>
<li>Service providers that charge users even when their call does not go through</li>
<li>Poor quality audio connections, including static, lag, echo, break-up, etc.</li>
<li>Cards that expire without the purchaser's knowledge and with no advance notice from the service provider </li>
<li>Per-call fees charged in addition to the per-minute charges</li>
</ul>
<p>The Gratis solution to these problems is as robust and reliable as it is easy to understand. Basically, the Gratis system has at its foundation an exceptional platform that can make call connections with amazingly high-definition audio quality. Equally as important, the actual time the user spends talking is the only thing for which that user is charged. In addition, Gratis has been designed for use as both an iPhone and Android app, so virtually any smart phone in the world will be able make and receive calls.</p>
<h2><b>How can you say Gratis is the next big thing in telecommunications? What makes it so different?</b></h2>
<p>Let’s look again at those annoying issues highlighted by the FCC and see how Gratis deals with each of them. Once again, Gratis is not just another phone app. It is an innovative telecommunications solution, which will forever change the way people communicate.</p>
<ul>
<li>No access numbers required!  Once loaded, Gratis is integrated directly into your phone. Users never – repeat, never – have to call an access number or enter a PIN code. With Gratis, you can direct dial any phone number in your contacts list, or you can use the keypad.</li>
<li>No trips to the shop to buy credit! With Gratis, you can buy credits from within the application itself (or online), so you never have to go to a retail shop.</li>
<li>See what you pay for, every time. No hidden charges, no per-call or maintenance fees, ever! Every time you finish a call, Gratis provides a detailed call record, which includes the destination number, call start time, duration, total cost of the call and your balance. Don’t worry if you’re too busy to look at this information after every call. The entire log is held on your phone and always available through a user-friendly menu.</li>
<li>Share the wealth! With Gratis, you can transfer pre-paid call credits to any one of your family or friends, provided they have a pre-paid account.</li>
<li>Need to make a call but you’re out of credit? No problem! With Gratis, you can request an “Emergency” top-up. Once the request is made, $2 in credit will be added to your account, and the next time you top-up, that $2 will be taken off the top. Who else offers that kind of security in an emergency situation?</li>
<li>Unrivalled call quality. With Gratis, it doesn’t matter whether you’re phoning a landline or mobile, or making free calls (Gratis to Gratis). The audio quality is crystal clear and utterly reliable, every time.</li>
<li>Credits never expire! With Gratis, you don’t have to worry about unused credit being subject to expiry dates. That’s just not fair, and Gratis will never allow it to happen to any of its users, ever.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Gratis so far… </b></h2>
<p>The engineers at Gratis Labs have already developed a platform that can support up to 500,000 users. As already noted, the company has developed a Gratis solution for both iPhone and Android users, which means the vast majority of mobile phone users around the world already have phones which will be able to use Gratis. </p>
<p>However, Gratis does much more – infinitely more – than just make and receive calls.  Remember, we told you that this is an innovative telecommunications solution, and people today do much more than just talk on the phone. </p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><b>Ok, then, what else can Gratis do?</b></h2>
<p>For starters, Gratis can send and receive chat messages, photos and videos, but you’re probably thinking that there are a few apps out there that can do that, too. Well, then, can those apps also translate chat messages (in real time) in no less than 64 languages? Because Gratis can! Whether you want to chat with foreign friends, clients, customers or the mysterious person you met while vacationing abroad, Gratis allows you to send a chat message in your own language, which will be simultaneously translated into the language of your choice. This feature is unique to the Gratis telecommunications solution.</p>
<h2><b>Well, that’s impressive. Anything else?</b></h2>
<p>As a matter of fact, yes! Gratis offers two other features that people are already raving about. The first is a “Recall” function. Let’s be honest with each other. We’ve probably all, at one time or another, sent a message, photo or video that we really – I mean REALLY – wished we hadn’t. Until Gratis came along, once that message was sent, there was no going back. However, the “Recall” function actually allows you to “take back” any message you’ve sent to any device. If the other user hasn’t gone online or doesn’t have Gratis switched on, they’ll never even know you’ve sent the message. If they have Gratis switched on but haven’t seen the message/photo/video, they’ll receive a notification that a message came in, but they won’t be able to see the actual message itself. Even if they’ve already seen the message, you can still delete it from their device. With Gratis, you’re in charge of the information you send, even after you’ve sent it and even if you wish you hadn’t sent it!</p>
<p>The other amazing feature offered by Gratis is something a lot more fun. Gratis isn’t just about high-tech wizardry, you know. Anyone with the Gratis app can customize their app screen. You can change the image, theme and even the colour.  Imagine being able to match your phone app to your wardrobe! With Gratis, you can.</p>
<p>Finally, some of our so-called competitors have found it necessary to have advertising pop-ups, which countless users have reported to find frustrating, annoying and even the source of unwelcome viruses! Gratis does not allow advertisers to communicate over the app and never will. </p>
<h2><b>Apart from these impressive features, why else should I join Gratis?</b></h2>
<p>Well, let’s see. We’ve talked about all the things Gratis can do, so why else would you want to use this system? The most obvious answer is…money! Gratis offers the lowest-priced calls/texts/messages on the planet, and that’s a fact. Just look at the ways you can save money compared to the system you’re using now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make enormous savings on long distance and international calls.</li>
<li>Get rid of your expensive call plans, many of which don’t even include international calls.</li>
<li>Make exceptional savings when sending international SMS messages.</li>
<li>Say goodbye to those outrageous and painfully expensive roaming charges!</li>
<li>Never lose money due to expired call credits.</li>
<li>Every call you make to other Gratis users is completely free of charge.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>This all sounds good! How do I get Gratis on my phone, and how much does it cost?</b></h2>
<p>The answer to the first question is simple, and the answer to the second question is even better. Android users can already go to our website, <a href=""http://gratislabs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://gratislabs.com</span></a> to download Gratis. For those with an iPhone, Gratis are pleased to announce that they have developed an iPhone version of the Gratis app and sent it to Apple for approval. Gratis Labs fully expects this version to be approved within the coming days. We will notify our friends and sponsors as soon as that approval has been received, on our website and our Facebook page.  </p>
<p>Once Gratis “goes live,” you will be able to go to the appropriate site and download the Gratis app. When the download is complete, a Gratis icon is clearly displayed on your phone. To use Gratis, just tap the icon and follow the extremely easy installation instructions on your screen. You’ll be happy to know that your mobile phone number is your user name, and no password is required!</p>
<p>As to how much the Gratis solution costs, many people expect that, because Gratis does not allow advertising through the app, it will be expensive.  Nothing could be further from the truth. The Gratis app is 100 percent free to download.</p>
<h2><b>Gratis going forward…</b></h2>
<p>Gratis Labs is now prepared to launch this amazing new telecommunications solution to the world on a commercial basis. For now, however, only our sponsors/backers and the friends they invite to join them will have access to this miraculous new telecommunications solution. The interest being expressed by the industry and users across the planet has been enormous. It appears virtually certain that within a very short period of time, many millions of people will be saving money by using Gratis for the vast majority of their communication needs.</p>
<p>At this time, the existing platform cannot accommodate the millions of people who want to use the Gratis app. The company is targeting investment of $30,000, which will allow Gratis Labs to launch the service on a commercial basis. That investment would allow the company to invest in the high-capacity, high-performance servers and other hardware necessary to service the first one million users. Once that is accomplished, funding should be in place to increase capacity to up to 100 million users. </p>
<p>For more information, you can visit the Gratis website, <a href=""http://www.gratislabs.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.gratislabs.com</a>, or follow us on Facebook or Twitter.</p>
<p>Once Gratis is installed on your phone, topping up is simple! Just tap on the “More” menu and select “Shop.” Finally, tap “Top-Up.” Select your choice of $4.99, $9.99 or $19.99 blocks of credit. As soon as the transaction is completed, the new balance will be displayed to include the top-up value.</p>
<p>Alternatively, users can opt for one of the many exceptional Gratis package deals on offer. The package information is displayed on a different backdrop and with a different theme to the top-up options, which also gives users some idea of how they can customize their own app.</p>
<h2><b>Once I’ve loaded Gratis on my phone, how do I use it to make calls?</b></h2>
<p>The user can now make “Gratis Out” calls, which refers to paid calls made using the Gratis app.  To call any number, you can dial as normal after selecting “Keypad<b>.</b>” Use the keypad as you would for any standard call, or you can select one of your existing contacts. Once the call is complete, a detailed record of the call will be saved in the “Call Detail” page, where users can see the number called, the date, time, duration and total cost of the call, as well as the remaining balance.</p>
<h2><b>How is using Gratis better than using a standard pre-paid phone card?</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>To start, all calls from one Gratis user to another are free, regardless of where the two parties are in the world. But let’s say the person you want to call is not online. Gratis will inform you of that fact and then suggest the most economical way to make a “Gratis Out” call to that same contact. </li>
<li>Gratis only charges for calls that have actually been connected.</li>
<li>Gratis call credits never expire. Never. You can use your credit without having to top-up for one year, five years, even 20 years, if you like.</li>
<li>The audio quality using Gratis is far superior to that experienced when making a standard mobile phone call.</li>
<li>You can keep your existing SIM card. With Gratis, there’s no need to change.</li>
<li>Gratis offers 24/7/365 support to all its customers. The app even has a support page where users can log any problem or query. Gratis guarantees that they will respond to that query within one hour, day or night.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>How do I buy Gratis pre-paid phone cards? </b></h2>
<p>Call credits can be purchased by selecting one of the “Top-up Perks” on the left side of this page.  Top-up values of $20, $50 and $100 are available. In addition, buyers receive 10% additional credit when you buy one of the perks on this page. </p>
<p>Call credits to the value of $4.99, $9.99 and $19.99 can also be purchased inside the app itself, or via our website <a href=""%22"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.gratislabs.com</a> . Please note that the additional 10% credit is not available when you use either of those options.  </p>
<p>You could also choose to select Gratis packages that contain a specific number of hours to call landlines and mobiles in selected countries. These call rates are exceptionally low and offer the best value in the global telecommunications market. Any of the packages shown on the left side of this page can be purchased by selecting the “Package perk” and following the instructions. Packages may also be purchased inside the app or on our website  <a href=""%22"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.gratislabs.com</a> . Please note that any of the packages bought as a Gratis Perk have the very lowest calling rates, even compared to similar package purchased inside the app or on our website.  </p>
<h2><b>How does Gratis compare with Skype, the “main competitor”?</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>Gratis does not allow advertisements to be displayed anywhere on the app. Skype, however, has annoying, unwanted pop-up ads which can appear at any time. </li>
<li>Gratis never charges per-call connection fees. Skype, on the other hand, charges connection fees of 4.9 cents or 8.9 cents per call, regardless of the length of that call. Those charges are outrageously expensive. At times, the connection cost is more than the actual call cost. The tables below compare Gratis and Skype call costs for one-minute and three-minute calls. For accuracy, we have included the Skype connection charges in the call cost.  <b>Please note: </b>Global telecom statistics indicate that the average call lasts approximately three minutes.</li>

<p>The above charts clearly show that Skype is at least three times more expensive than Gratis for a one-minute call. To be fair, we should point out that Skype is only twice as expensive as Gratis for a three-minute call. As the average duration of a call is approximately three minutes, we can only say with certainty that Gratis calls cost just half of what Skype calls will take out of your pocket.</p>
<p>We have made several references to the call quality you can expect to enjoy through the Gratis solution. We’d like to back up these claims by inviting you to download the Gratis app at <a href=""http://gratislabs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://gratislabs.com</span></a>. Invite your friends to download the app, and then make some free calls. You’ll be amazed at the audio quality, which is vastly superior to anything offered by Skype.</p>
<h2><b>Will any of the Gratis pre-paid phone cards or Gratis Packages be available for retail purchase later on? </b></h2>
<p>Anyone (including distributing companies and retailers) can purchase the Gratis Perks during the launch campaign at the same price as any member of the general public who decides to take part in the crowdfunding campaign. </p>
<p>To make your Gratis experience even better (and less expensive), if you purchase a top-up of $500 or more using one of the Gratis Perk options, we will give you between 15 and 25% additional value, and we will also provide an app that can be used to resell our products, allowing you to recoup that 15% to 25% margin.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><b>Why should I trust Gratis?</b></h2>
<p>Gratis Labs wholeheartedly believes that this new communications solution is the best pre-paid phone system on the market today. We trust the audio quality of our voice calls, and we know that we have the best call rates on the global market. Therefore, we can make the following unconditional offer:  If you are not happy with the voice quality of your Gratis calls or the call rates on offer, we will refund in full the remaining call credits on your pre-paid account. For package users, we will refund the remaining value of your existing package on a pro-rata basis. This refund is also applicable to Top-up Perks and Package Perks. No strings attached. </p>
<p>To receive your refund won’t require endless texts, calls and emails, either. In the extremely unlikely event that you’re not happy with your Gratis package, simply fill in the CONTACT page in the app, where you can request your refund. Refund processing takes an average of just one to five days, depending on the payment method you used to buy your package/minutes. Try getting a refund from Skype that fast…or at all, for that matter!</p>
<h2><b>What we have achieved thus far... </b></h2>
<p>We have developed a stable, reliable voice platform that can handle all calls made and received by Gratis users. </p>
<p>We have developed an equally reliable SMS platform which can handle all SMS messages sent from the Gratis app.</p>
<p>We have also developed a chat platform which can handle all chat messages, photos and videos sent and received by the Gratis app.</p>
<p>In addition, we have developed a unique and truly amazing translation platform, which at the tap of an icon can translate your chat messages into a language understood by the person who is receiving the message. This translation feature will allow people who do not speak the same language to chat in real time, with each person writing in the language of their choice. This feature can be also be used for business purposes, as well as for personal chats. Imagine a feature that will allow a grandmother to communicate with her grandchildren, who are growing up abroad and do not speak the same language.</p>
<p>Gratis is no longer merely on the drawing board. After years of research and fine-tuning, we have already invested in infrastructure that can handle up to 500,000 users.</p>
<p>To ensure we can offer the Gratis service to the widest possible range of users across the world, we have developed both iPhone and Android apps, both of which will enable users to make and receive voice calls, chat messages, SMS texts, photos and videos. The app has been fully tested and has without question reached commercial launch level.  Please download the app at <a href=""http://gratislabs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://gratislabs.com</a>; you will enjoy it!</p>
<p>We have also created a website, where you can learn all about the Gratis solution: <a href=""http://www.gratislabs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.gratislabs.com</a></p>
<h2><b>Where our sponsors fit in ... </b></h2>
<p>We need at least an additional $30,000 in investment to launch a global commercial service. This funding is needed for hardware requirements, including high-capacity, high-performance servers, which will increase our existing capacity from 500,000 to 1 million users.</p>
<p>If we receive more funding than our targeted goal, Gratis Labs will invest the additional funds to expand our capacity to several hundred million users, as follows:</p>
<p>At $30 000 of additional investment, we can increase capacity to 1 million users.</p>
<p>At $100 000, we can increase capacity to 2 million users.</p>
<p>At $250 000, we can increase capacity to 5 million users.</p>
<p>At $500 000, we can increase capacity to 10 million users.</p>
<p>At $2,500,000, we can increase capacity to 50 million users.</p>
<p>At $5,000,000, we can increase our capacity to a staggering 100 million users.</p>
<h2><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></h2>
<p>If you cannot or do not wish to contribute financially, it doesn't mean you can't help Gratis get started. Please, get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. To make it even easier to spread the news about Gratis, you can use the Indiegogo share tools.</p>
<h2><b>Proposed Timeframe</b></h2>
<p>The total amount of time we have dedicated to setting up the new infrastructure required to handle 1 million users is two months. The GRATIS application itself, however, is already fully developed and available at <a href=""http://gratislabs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://gratislabs.com</a>  for Android users. As already stated, we expect to receive approval from Apple for the iPhone version within the next few days.</p>

Gratis Labs is one of the major new players in the telecommunications industry. The company was specifically formed to offer innovative telecommunications solutions to the most frequent problems phone service users encounter, as defined and specified by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The team at the core of the enterprise is made up of telecom and software engineers with decades of combined experience in telecommunications research and development, network integration, network operations and maintenance and large-scale project management. The company’s directors have worked on projects for American and European telecom giants. 
About this project
The Gratis project has been specifically designed and created to bring an all-encompassing telecommunications solution to the global market. Gratis is not just the “next generation” communications application to come onto the market. Rather, Gratis will undoubtedly be the market leader which changes the way people communicate…forever!
The following issues have been highlighted by the FCC as the most common problems faced by pre-paid phone card users (see this link for details: https://www.fcc.gov/document/pre-paid-phone-cards-tip-sheet):

Access numbers and/or PINs that don't work
Service or access numbers that are always busy
Card issuers going out of business, leaving people with useless cards and no means by which they can claim a refund
Rates that are higher – and often considerably higher – than advertised 
Imposition of mysterious and undisclosed ""post-call"" fees, which service providers deduct after the user completes a call
Imposition of even more mysterious and undisclosed ""maintenance"" fees, which the service providers deduct either after a call or at regular intervals
Service providers that charge users even when their call does not go through
Poor quality audio connections, including static, lag, echo, break-up, etc.
Cards that expire without the purchaser's knowledge and with no advance notice from the service provider 
Per-call fees charged in addition to the per-minute charges

The Gratis solution to these problems is as robust and reliable as it is easy to understand. Basically, the Gratis system has at its foundation an exceptional platform that can make call connections with amazingly high-definition audio quality. Equally as important, the actual time the user spends talking is the only thing for which that user is charged. In addition, Gratis has been designed for use as both an iPhone and Android app, so virtually any smart phone in the world will be able make and receive calls.
How can you say Gratis is the next big thing in telecommunications? What makes it so different?
Let’s look again at those annoying issues highlighted by the FCC and see how Gratis deals with each of them. Once again, Gratis is not just another phone app. It is an innovative telecommunications solution, which will forever change the way people communicate.

No access numbers required!  Once loaded, Gratis is integrated directly into your phone. Users never – repeat, never – have to call an access number or enter a PIN code. With Gratis, you can direct dial any phone number in your contacts list, or you can use the keypad.
No trips to the shop to buy credit! With Gratis, you can buy credits from within the application itself (or online), so you never have to go to a retail shop.
See what you pay for, every time. No hidden charges, no per-call or maintenance fees, ever! Every time you finish a call, Gratis provides a detailed call record, which includes the destination number, call start time, duration, total cost of the call and your balance. Don’t worry if you’re too busy to look at this information after every call. The entire log is held on your phone and always available through a user-friendly menu.
Share the wealth! With Gratis, you can transfer pre-paid call credits to any one of your family or friends, provided they have a pre-paid account.
Need to make a call but you’re out of credit? No problem! With Gratis, you can request an “Emergency” top-up. Once the request is made, $2 in credit will be added to your account, and the next time you top-up, that $2 will be taken off the top. Who else offers that kind of security in an emergency situation?
Unrivalled call quality. With Gratis, it doesn’t matter whether you’re phoning a landline or mobile, or making free calls (Gratis to Gratis). The audio quality is crystal clear and utterly reliable, every time.
Credits never expire! With Gratis, you don’t have to worry about unused credit being subject to expiry dates. That’s just not fair, and Gratis will never allow it to happen to any of its users, ever.

Gratis so far… 
The engineers at Gratis Labs have already developed a platform that can support up to 500,000 users. As already noted, the company has developed a Gratis solution for both iPhone and Android users, which means the vast majority of mobile phone users around the world already have phones which will be able to use Gratis. 
However, Gratis does much more – infinitely more – than just make and receive calls.  Remember, we told you that this is an innovative telecommunications solution, and people today do much more than just talk on the phone. 


Ok, then, what else can Gratis do?
For starters, Gratis can send and receive chat messages, photos and videos, but you’re probably thinking that there are a few apps out there that can do that, too. Well, then, can those apps also translate chat messages (in real time) in no less than 64 languages? Because Gratis can! Whether you want to chat with foreign friends, clients, customers or the mysterious person you met while vacationing abroad, Gratis allows you to send a chat message in your own language, which will be simultaneously translated into the language of your choice. This feature is unique to the Gratis telecommunications solution.
Well, that’s impressive. Anything else?
As a matter of fact, yes! Gratis offers two other features that people are already raving about. The first is a “Recall” function. Let’s be honest with each other. We’ve probably all, at one time or another, sent a message, photo or video that we really – I mean REALLY – wished we hadn’t. Until Gratis came along, once that message was sent, there was no going back. However, the “Recall” function actually allows you to “take back” any message you’ve sent to any device. If the other user hasn’t gone online or doesn’t have Gratis switched on, they’ll never even know you’ve sent the message. If they have Gratis switched on but haven’t seen the message/photo/video, they’ll receive a notification that a message came in, but they won’t be able to see the actual message itself. Even if they’ve already seen the message, you can still delete it from their device. With Gratis, you’re in charge of the information you send, even after you’ve sent it and even if you wish you hadn’t sent it!
The other amazing feature offered by Gratis is something a lot more fun. Gratis isn’t just about high-tech wizardry, you know. Anyone with the Gratis app can customize their app screen. You can change the image, theme and even the colour.  Imagine being able to match your phone app to your wardrobe! With Gratis, you can.
Finally, some of our so-called competitors have found it necessary to have advertising pop-ups, which countless users have reported to find frustrating, annoying and even the source of unwelcome viruses! Gratis does not allow advertisers to communicate over the app and never will. 
Apart from these impressive features, why else should I join Gratis?
Well, let’s see. We’ve talked about all the things Gratis can do, so why else would you want to use this system? The most obvious answer is…money! Gratis offers the lowest-priced calls/texts/messages on the planet, and that’s a fact. Just look at the ways you can save money compared to the system you’re using now:

Make enormous savings on long distance and international calls.
Get rid of your expensive call plans, many of which don’t even include international calls.
Make exceptional savings when sending international SMS messages.
Say goodbye to those outrageous and painfully expensive roaming charges!
Never lose money due to expired call credits.
Every call you make to other Gratis users is completely free of charge.

This all sounds good! How do I get Gratis on my phone, and how much does it cost?
The answer to the first question is simple, and the answer to the second question is even better. Android users can already go to our website, http://gratislabs.com to download Gratis. For those with an iPhone, Gratis are pleased to announce that they have developed an iPhone version of the Gratis app and sent it to Apple for approval. Gratis Labs fully expects this version to be approved within the coming days. We will notify our friends and sponsors as soon as that approval has been received, on our website and our Facebook page.  
Once Gratis “goes live,” you will be able to go to the appropriate site and download the Gratis app. When the download is complete, a Gratis icon is clearly displayed on your phone. To use Gratis, just tap the icon and follow the extremely easy installation instructions on your screen. You’ll be happy to know that your mobile phone number is your user name, and no password is required!
As to how much the Gratis solution costs, many people expect that, because Gratis does not allow advertising through the app, it will be expensive.  Nothing could be further from the truth. The Gratis app is 100 percent free to download.
Gratis going forward…
Gratis Labs is now prepared to launch this amazing new telecommunications solution to the world on a commercial basis. For now, however, only our sponsors/backers and the friends they invite to join them will have access to this miraculous new telecommunications solution. The interest being expressed by the industry and users across the planet has been enormous. It appears virtually certain that within a very short period of time, many millions of people will be saving money by using Gratis for the vast majority of their communication needs.
At this time, the existing platform cannot accommodate the millions of people who want to use the Gratis app. The company is targeting investment of $30,000, which will allow Gratis Labs to launch the service on a commercial basis. That investment would allow the company to invest in the high-capacity, high-performance servers and other hardware necessary to service the first one million users. Once that is accomplished, funding should be in place to increase capacity to up to 100 million users. 
For more information, you can visit the Gratis website, www.gratislabs.com, or follow us on Facebook or Twitter.
Once Gratis is installed on your phone, topping up is simple! Just tap on the “More” menu and select “Shop.” Finally, tap “Top-Up.” Select your choice of $4.99, $9.99 or $19.99 blocks of credit. As soon as the transaction is completed, the new balance will be displayed to include the top-up value.
Alternatively, users can opt for one of the many exceptional Gratis package deals on offer. The package information is displayed on a different backdrop and with a different theme to the top-up options, which also gives users some idea of how they can customize their own app.
Once I’ve loaded Gratis on my phone, how do I use it to make calls?
The user can now make “Gratis Out” calls, which refers to paid calls made using the Gratis app.  To call any number, you can dial as normal after selecting “Keypad.” Use the keypad as you would for any standard call, or you can select one of your existing contacts. Once the call is complete, a detailed record of the call will be saved in the “Call Detail” page, where users can see the number called, the date, time, duration and total cost of the call, as well as the remaining balance.
How is using Gratis better than using a standard pre-paid phone card?

To start, all calls from one Gratis user to another are free, regardless of where the two parties are in the world. But let’s say the person you want to call is not online. Gratis will inform you of that fact and then suggest the most economical way to make a “Gratis Out” call to that same contact. 
Gratis only charges for calls that have actually been connected.
Gratis call credits never expire. Never. You can use your credit without having to top-up for one year, five years, even 20 years, if you like.
The audio quality using Gratis is far superior to that experienced when making a standard mobile phone call.
You can keep your existing SIM card. With Gratis, there’s no need to change.
Gratis offers 24/7/365 support to all its customers. The app even has a support page where users can log any problem or query. Gratis guarantees that they will respond to that query within one hour, day or night.

How do I buy Gratis pre-paid phone cards? 
Call credits can be purchased by selecting one of the “Top-up Perks” on the left side of this page.  Top-up values of $20, $50 and $100 are available. In addition, buyers receive 10% additional credit when you buy one of the perks on this page. 
Call credits to the value of $4.99, $9.99 and $19.99 can also be purchased inside the app itself, or via our website http://www.gratislabs.com . Please note that the additional 10% credit is not available when you use either of those options.  
You could also choose to select Gratis packages that contain a specific number of hours to call landlines and mobiles in selected countries. These call rates are exceptionally low and offer the best value in the global telecommunications market. Any of the packages shown on the left side of this page can be purchased by selecting the “Package perk” and following the instructions. Packages may also be purchased inside the app or on our website  http://www.gratislabs.com . Please note that any of the packages bought as a Gratis Perk have the very lowest calling rates, even compared to similar package purchased inside the app or on our website.  
How does Gratis compare with Skype, the “main competitor”?

Gratis does not allow advertisements to be displayed anywhere on the app. Skype, however, has annoying, unwanted pop-up ads which can appear at any time. 
Gratis never charges per-call connection fees. Skype, on the other hand, charges connection fees of 4.9 cents or 8.9 cents per call, regardless of the length of that call. Those charges are outrageously expensive. At times, the connection cost is more than the actual call cost. The tables below compare Gratis and Skype call costs for one-minute and three-minute calls. For accuracy, we have included the Skype connection charges in the call cost.  Please note: Global telecom statistics indicate that the average call lasts approximately three minutes.

This chart shows charges for a one-minute call. The prices are shown in U.S cents

The above charts clearly show that Skype is at least three times more expensive than Gratis for a one-minute call. To be fair, we should point out that Skype is only twice as expensive as Gratis for a three-minute call. As the average duration of a call is approximately three minutes, we can only say with certainty that Gratis calls cost just half of what Skype calls will take out of your pocket.
We have made several references to the call quality you can expect to enjoy through the Gratis solution. We’d like to back up these claims by inviting you to download the Gratis app at http://gratislabs.com. Invite your friends to download the app, and then make some free calls. You’ll be amazed at the audio quality, which is vastly superior to anything offered by Skype.
Will any of the Gratis pre-paid phone cards or Gratis Packages be available for retail purchase later on? 
Anyone (including distributing companies and retailers) can purchase the Gratis Perks during the launch campaign at the same price as any member of the general public who decides to take part in the crowdfunding campaign. 
To make your Gratis experience even better (and less expensive), if you purchase a top-up of $500 or more using one of the Gratis Perk options, we will give you between 15 and 25% additional value, and we will also provide an app that can be used to resell our products, allowing you to recoup that 15% to 25% margin.


Why should I trust Gratis?
Gratis Labs wholeheartedly believes that this new communications solution is the best pre-paid phone system on the market today. We trust the audio quality of our voice calls, and we know that we have the best call rates on the global market. Therefore, we can make the following unconditional offer:  If you are not happy with the voice quality of your Gratis calls or the call rates on offer, we will refund in full the remaining call credits on your pre-paid account. For package users, we will refund the remaining value of your existing package on a pro-rata basis. This refund is also applicable to Top-up Perks and Package Perks. No strings attached. 
To receive your refund won’t require endless texts, calls and emails, either. In the extremely unlikely event that you’re not happy with your Gratis package, simply fill in the CONTACT page in the app, where you can request your refund. Refund processing takes an average of just one to five days, depending on the payment method you used to buy your package/minutes. Try getting a refund from Skype that fast…or at all, for that matter!
What we have achieved thus far... 
We have developed a stable, reliable voice platform that can handle all calls made and received by Gratis users. 
We have developed an equally reliable SMS platform which can handle all SMS messages sent from the Gratis app.
We have also developed a chat platform which can handle all chat messages, photos and videos sent and received by the Gratis app.
In addition, we have developed a unique and truly amazing translation platform, which at the tap of an icon can translate your chat messages into a language understood by the person who is receiving the message. This translation feature will allow people who do not speak the same language to chat in real time, with each person writing in the language of their choice. This feature can be also be used for business purposes, as well as for personal chats. Imagine a feature that will allow a grandmother to communicate with her grandchildren, who are growing up abroad and do not speak the same language.
Gratis is no longer merely on the drawing board. After years of research and fine-tuning, we have already invested in infrastructure that can handle up to 500,000 users.
To ensure we can offer the Gratis service to the widest possible range of users across the world, we have developed both iPhone and Android apps, both of which will enable users to make and receive voice calls, chat messages, SMS texts, photos and videos. The app has been fully tested and has without question reached commercial launch level.  Please download the app at http://gratislabs.com; you will enjoy it!
We have also created a website, where you can learn all about the Gratis solution: www.gratislabs.com
Where our sponsors fit in ... 
We need at least an additional $30,000 in investment to launch a global commercial service. This funding is needed for hardware requirements, including high-capacity, high-performance servers, which will increase our existing capacity from 500,000 to 1 million users.
If we receive more funding than our targeted goal, Gratis Labs will invest the additional funds to expand our capacity to several hundred million users, as follows:
At $30 000 of additional investment, we can increase capacity to 1 million users.
At $100 000, we can increase capacity to 2 million users.
At $250 000, we can increase capacity to 5 million users.
At $500 000, we can increase capacity to 10 million users.
At $2,500,000, we can increase capacity to 50 million users.
At $5,000,000, we can increase our capacity to a staggering 100 million users.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot or do not wish to contribute financially, it doesn't mean you can't help Gratis get started. Please, get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. To make it even easier to spread the news about Gratis, you can use the Indiegogo share tools.
Proposed Timeframe
The total amount of time we have dedicated to setting up the new infrastructure required to handle 1 million users is two months. The GRATIS application itself, however, is already fully developed and available at http://gratislabs.com  for Android users. As already stated, we expect to receive approval from Apple for the iPhone version within the next few days.
Details of the proposed roll-out phases are as follows:

Month One: Hardware and software installation for voice platform, SMS platform and chat platform.
Months One to Two:  Deploy the product platform and perform load performance tests for inter-operability,
End of Month Two:  Open the application to 1 million additional users.

Background

Many Conway locals have fond memories of Nye's Pharmacy - folks are passionate about this place. In the 1950's and 60's the promise of Nye's was used to bribe kids to behave during a dreaded visit to the doctor. A stop at Nye's Pharmacy meant a cherry coke, cheeseburger and french fries - maybe even an ice cream. For many Conway teenagers in the late 1960's, Sunday afternoon cruising always led to a meet-up at Nye's.

Est. 1953.

  
  What We Need   We are raising funds to have a local sign company restore the sign. They will sandblast it and repaint it to its original colors. The restored sign will be re-installed on top of the Nye's Pharmacy building.
Once the sign is restored, we will investigate replacing the previous neon lighting with LED light strips and reinstalling the original light covers.
   The Impact Your contribution will make a difference in Conway.  Nye's Pharmacy is a local historic landmark. 
Constructed in 1953, the building is the city’s only example of modern architecture. This restoration demonstrates that we care about preserving our community's history and the structures that tell its stories.

Every day we hear about the surge in people working from home, the local cafe or from co-working spaces that are springing up everywhere.

Despite its enormous popularity there is no single online #telework hub - not till now. 

Cue www.teleworktoday.net - a feature-rich website that delivers the latest legitimate telework jobs along with training, networking and news.

Telework Today is a site destined to be Australia's online Telework Hub Our aim is to promote, inform & educate. We love Teleworking and want to open others' minds to the huge advantages of a remote workforce. We want to see less traffic,  a reduction in travel time, a better work/life balance and increased productivity as our nation embraces the digital age.





   The Pitch We are raising funds to promote and develop the Telework Today website.


Our goal is to finance an advertising campaign promoting the merits of telecommuting and showing how perfectly suited it is for Australia.
Our objective is to promote telecommuting via ads on the back of buses in Australian capital cities and major regional hubs.  We will launch a series of punchy online ads drawing people to www.teleworktoday.net and highlight the advantages of 'steering clear of the office'.
In the past 12-months the Australian government has 'archived' its www.telework.gov.au website. There is currently no Australia-based online portal  for telecommuters. We think this void must be filled.
Campaign funds will be (approximately) split as follows - 40% public transport advertising campaign, 40% online and print media promotion and advertising and 20% web development and site administration.
 




   The Impact A few facts about commuting to work in Australia.  The average Australian worker spends over 1 hour a day commuting. This equates to almost 10 (wasted) days each year! 
Work in a capital city and this figure rises to 1.5hrs a day or 15 days a year!
Sydney commuters spend up to 4-days a year sitting in the car.
Motorist spends up to $20,000pa commuting to work. This includes registration, parking and petrol. Don't know about you but I'd rather take a luxury trip to Europe each year than pay that!
An average CBD worker spends up to $13,000pa on public transport - not to mention the wasted travel time.
Tuesday and Wednesday mornings are, on average, the worst for traffic.
Apart from the frustration faction, commuting can cause back pain, higher cholesterol, and higher levels of obesity. 


That said .....  Studies have shown teleworkers can be up to be 50% more productive, have far less stress in their lives, enjoy a better work/life balance and spend more time with family. Advantages for business & managers are - Cost savings, less office space needed, happier employees, retention of valued staff,  greater geographical availability of talent and many more bonuses.

<p>De Doação para Impacto – Por cada 10 Euros doados, paga 1 hora de formação no programa eYe para 1 jovem desempregado e ajuda-o a estar mais perto de um emprego!</p>
<p><b>Qual é o problema?</b></p>
<p>O desemprego juvenil é um problema gravemente complexo e é um problema que nos afecta a todos.</p>
<p>60% dos empregadores entrevistados em toda a Europa diz que os jovens candidatos que entrevistam para empregos não têm as habilidades sociais e competências adequadas. E enquanto 7,5 milhões de jovens de toda a Europa estão sem emprego, sem formação ou educação , 2 milhões de empregos estão vagos - limitando o crescimento dos empregadores e criando instabilidade para a sociedade.</p>
<p>Ninguém consegue resolver o problema do desemprego jovem – sozinho! A solução está na colaboração!</p>
<p><b>Qual é a solução que a certificação eYe oferece?</b></p>
<p>O programa eYe  oferece uma abordagem radicalmente nova para resolver o problema do desemprego jovem. Nós construímos uma comunidade de Impacto de empregadores, organizações, instituições académicas e indivíduos.</p>
Colaboramos para:
<br/><p>- Recolha de necessidades de contratação dos empregadores</p>
<p>- Selecção de jovens desempregados</p>
<p>- Fornecer 6 meses formação de competências e habilidades sociais e um estágio</p>
<p>- Fornecer acesso ao emprego ... o que seria de outra forma estaria fora do alcance dos jovens desempregados.</p>
<p>- O programa de certificação eYe é a ponte entre o sistema de ensino e as empresas de contratação.</p>
<p>O eYe forma competências (por exemplo, comunicação, resolução de problemas, auto -conhecimento, etc. ) que os empregadores estão à procura desesperadamente, mas que o sistema de ensino não fornece. Damos aos jovens desempregados espaço para aprender, para se prepararem para um emprego, para aumentar os seus níveis de auto -confiança, ganharem experiência de trabalho relevante através de um estágio e construir uma forte comunidade com ideias semelhantes. No final do programa de 6 meses nós conectamos os nossos participantes com oportunidades de trabalho dentro da comunidade de impacto.</p>
<p><b>Isto não é magia – é o poder da colaboração!</b></p>
<p>Consegue imaginar a juventude – sem trabalho, sem opcções de futuro – e voce pode ajudar a abrir a porta para um amanhã melhor? </p>
<p><b><br/>Quem é que começou o programa de certificação eYe?</b></p>
<p>Em 2014 a CircularSociety começou o projeto eYe.</p>
<p>A CircularSociety  é uma empresa baseada na Suiça, fundada por Carsten Sudhoff (formador em HR do Word Economic Forum). A CircularSociety constroi uma Comunidade onde as empresas, organizações e individuos colaboram para resolver os problemas dos nossos dias. Nós aplicamos uma abordagem de negócio para resolver problemas de cariz social e aproveitar a mentalidade colaborativa da geração do século 21 para conduzir em grande escala empresarial sustentável e de mudança social.</p>
<p>Em vez de estarmos só a falar dos problemas que existem na nossa sociedade e de passar a responsabilidade para outro, nós decidimos criar verdadeiras soluções!</p>
<p><i>""O European Youth Employment (eYe) - Certificado é uma abordagem inovadora para aumentar a empregabilidade dos jovens e para ajudar os empregadores contratar novos talentos . "" (Jan Mühlfeit , Presidente Europa, Microsoft Corporation 2007-2014)</i></p>
<p>Nós desenvolvemos as competencias de jovens desempregados e vamos ajudá-los a encontrar um emprego.</p>
<p>Com o seu donativo,  pode- se tornar parte desta comunidade e ver como o seu apoio financeiro vai mudar a vida de uma pessoa desempregada. Mesmo por mais pequena que seja a sua doação para o eYe.</p>
Nós trabalhamos em colaboração com a Embaixada Portuguesa na Suíça e com a Câmara de Comércio Suíço -Português.<p></p>
<p>Temos os seguintes campeões organizacionais como nossos parceiros:</p>
<p>Nosso primeiro grupo de 30 jovens participantes irá começar em Setúbal, Portugal no final de setembro de 2015 - e precisamos de sua ajuda para garantir o financiamento necessário! O currículo de formação eYe foi projetado, os formadores e técnicos estão agendados, o local está preparado para a  Comunidade eYe em Portugal e está a crescer cada vez mais. As empresas que procuram novos funcionários estão à nossa espera.</p>
<p>Estamos prontos para ir! O seu donativo pode acender a chama!</p>
<p>O Emprego Jovem é essencial para um futuro sustentável na Europa - a sua decisão de doar pode desencadear muitas mais pessoas a faze-lo. A nossa viagem começa em Portugal, se conseguirmos o financiamento necessário para este primeiro grupo, vamos ser capazes de provar a viabilidade do programa eYe e ampliar nosso projeto para mais países na Europa. País por país, estamos determinados a ajudar a encontrar empregos para 50 mil jovens desempregados na Europa até 2018!</p>
<p><b>O que precisamos?</b></p>
<p>O nosso objectivo é angariar 70.000 Euros até 29 de Setembro de 2015, data que marca o inicio da nossa primeira formação eYe em Setúbal, Portugal.</p>
<p>Os fundos (ver no Indiegogo taxas e presentes) irão pagar:</p>
<p>- Formação e Desenvolvimento (9 dos melhores formadores e tecnicos, 6 meses de um Curso Online de Inglês com horas ilimitadas, orientação e aconselhamento vocavional, etc.)

</p>
<p>- Acomodação (estadia noturna durante 15 dias de workshop no Parque de Alambre, Portugal)</p>
<p>- Refeições (Pequeno almoço, almoço e jantar durante os 15 dias de workshop)</p>
<p>- Eventos de criação de contactos (com empregadores e executivos)</p>
<p>Para os 30 participantes durante a formação nos Workshops eYe.

“The European Youth Employment (eYe) - Certificate is a ground breaking approach to increase the employability of young people and to help employers hire talent.” (Jan Mühlfeit, Chairman Europe, Microsoft Corporation 2007-2014)We work in collaboration with the Portuguese Embassy in Switzerland and with the Swiss-Portuguese Chamber of Commerce to increase job opportunities!Every 10 USD you donate pay for 1 hour of the eYe program for 1 young unemployed participant and brings them closer to a job!If we raise 70,000$ we can give this chance to 30 unemployed youth, proving the concept of our program and get more investors to be able to scale up to other countries, like Italy, UK and Greece.
(Please see Portuguese translation at the end of the page)If you had the opportunity to give someone hope, renewed self-confidence, a brighter future and a means of supporting themselves... all for a small donation... would you help? 
What is the problem?
Youth Unemployment is a massively complex issue and it is everybody’s problem.
60% of surveyed employers across Europe say that the young candidates they interview for jobs do not have the right soft skills and competencies. And while 7.5 million young people across Europe are out of a job, out of training or education, 2 million jobs are vacant and cannot be filled – limiting the growth of companies and creating instability for societies.

Nobody can solve the problem of Youth Unemployment – alone! The solution lies in collaboration!

How does the eYe certification program offer a solution?
The eYe certification program offers a radically new approach to solve the problem of Youth Unemployment. We have built an Impact Community of employers, organizations, academic institutions and individuals. We collaborate to:


1. Collect employers' hiring needs


2. Select young unemployed people


3. Provide 6 months of soft skills and competency training, coaching and an internship


4. Give employers access to young talent with the right skills


5. Connect eYe graduates with employment opportunities... which would otherwise be out of reach for the young unemployed


6. We ask eYe-graduates to remain part of the Impact Community and mentor the next cohort of young unemployed eYe participants








The eYe certification program is the bridge between the education system and the hiring companies.

eYe trains those soft skills and competencies (e.g. communication, problem solving, self-awareness, etc.) that employers are desperately looking for but that the education system does not provide. We give young unemployed the space to learn, to prepare for a job, to grow their levels of self-confidence, gain relevant work experience through an internship and build a strong community of like-minded. At the end of the 6-months program we connect our participants with job opportunities with employers in the eYe-Community.

This is not magic – it is simply the power of collaboration.

Can you imagine a youth - with
no job, no options for a future - and you help open the door to a
brighter tomorrow?

PORTUGUESE TRANSLATION
De Doação para Impacto – Por cada 10 Euros doados, paga 1 hora de formação no programa eYe para 1 jovem desempregado e ajuda-o a estar mais perto de um emprego!
Qual é o problema?
O desemprego juvenil é um problema gravemente complexo e é um problema que nos afecta a todos.
60% dos empregadores entrevistados em toda a Europa diz que os jovens candidatos que entrevistam para empregos não têm as habilidades sociais e competências adequadas. E enquanto 7,5 milhões de jovens de toda a Europa estão sem emprego, sem formação ou educação , 2 milhões de empregos estão vagos - limitando o crescimento dos empregadores e criando instabilidade para a sociedade.
Ninguém consegue resolver o problema do desemprego jovem – sozinho! A solução está na colaboração!
Qual é a solução que a certificação eYe oferece?
O programa eYe  oferece uma abordagem radicalmente nova para resolver o problema do desemprego jovem. Nós construímos uma comunidade de Impacto de empregadores, organizações, instituições académicas e indivíduos.
Colaboramos para:
- Recolha de necessidades de contratação dos empregadores
- Selecção de jovens desempregados
- Fornecer 6 meses formação de competências e habilidades sociais e um estágio
- Fornecer acesso ao emprego ... o que seria de outra forma estaria fora do alcance dos jovens desempregados.
- O programa de certificação eYe é a ponte entre o sistema de ensino e as empresas de contratação.
O eYe forma competências (por exemplo, comunicação, resolução de problemas, auto -conhecimento, etc. ) que os empregadores estão à procura desesperadamente, mas que o sistema de ensino não fornece. Damos aos jovens desempregados espaço para aprender, para se prepararem para um emprego, para aumentar os seus níveis de auto -confiança, ganharem experiência de trabalho relevante através de um estágio e construir uma forte comunidade com ideias semelhantes. No final do programa de 6 meses nós conectamos os nossos participantes com oportunidades de trabalho dentro da comunidade de impacto.
Isto não é magia – é o poder da colaboração!
Consegue imaginar a juventude – sem trabalho, sem opcções de futuro – e voce pode ajudar a abrir a porta para um amanhã melhor? 
Quem é que começou o programa de certificação eYe?
Em 2014 a CircularSociety começou o projeto eYe.
A CircularSociety  é uma empresa baseada na Suiça, fundada por Carsten Sudhoff (formador em HR do Word Economic Forum). A CircularSociety constroi uma Comunidade onde as empresas, organizações e individuos colaboram para resolver os problemas dos nossos dias. Nós aplicamos uma abordagem de negócio para resolver problemas de cariz social e aproveitar a mentalidade colaborativa da geração do século 21 para conduzir em grande escala empresarial sustentável e de mudança social.
Em vez de estarmos só a falar dos problemas que existem na nossa sociedade e de passar a responsabilidade para outro, nós decidimos criar verdadeiras soluções!
""O European Youth Employment (eYe) - Certificado é uma abordagem inovadora para aumentar a empregabilidade dos jovens e para ajudar os empregadores contratar novos talentos . "" (Jan Mühlfeit , Presidente Europa, Microsoft Corporation 2007-2014)
Nós desenvolvemos as competencias de jovens desempregados e vamos ajudá-los a encontrar um emprego.
Com o seu donativo,  pode- se tornar parte desta comunidade e ver como o seu apoio financeiro vai mudar a vida de uma pessoa desempregada. Mesmo por mais pequena que seja a sua doação para o eYe.
Nós trabalhamos em colaboração com a Embaixada Portuguesa na Suíça e com a Câmara de Comércio Suíço -Português.
Temos os seguintes campeões organizacionais como nossos parceiros:
Nosso primeiro grupo de 30 jovens participantes irá começar em Setúbal, Portugal no final de setembro de 2015 - e precisamos de sua ajuda para garantir o financiamento necessário! O currículo de formação eYe foi projetado, os formadores e técnicos estão agendados, o local está preparado para a  Comunidade eYe em Portugal e está a crescer cada vez mais. As empresas que procuram novos funcionários estão à nossa espera.
Estamos prontos para ir! O seu donativo pode acender a chama!
O Emprego Jovem é essencial para um futuro sustentável na Europa - a sua decisão de doar pode desencadear muitas mais pessoas a faze-lo. A nossa viagem começa em Portugal, se conseguirmos o financiamento necessário para este primeiro grupo, vamos ser capazes de provar a viabilidade do programa eYe e ampliar nosso projeto para mais países na Europa. País por país, estamos determinados a ajudar a encontrar empregos para 50 mil jovens desempregados na Europa até 2018!
O que precisamos?
O nosso objectivo é angariar 70.000 Euros até 29 de Setembro de 2015, data que marca o inicio da nossa primeira formação eYe em Setúbal, Portugal.
Os fundos (ver no Indiegogo taxas e presentes) irão pagar:
- Formação e Desenvolvimento (9 dos melhores formadores e tecnicos, 6 meses de um Curso Online de Inglês com horas ilimitadas, orientação e aconselhamento vocavional, etc.)


- Acomodação (estadia noturna durante 15 dias de workshop no Parque de Alambre, Portugal)
- Refeições (Pequeno almoço, almoço e jantar durante os 15 dias de workshop)
- Eventos de criação de contactos (com empregadores e executivos)
Para os 30 participantes durante a formação nos Workshops eYe.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Who We Are</h3>
<p>   Pawsitive Care is a small, veteran owned, family business that was started by Ashley Rivera in 2015. Ashley and her husband Jim have 3 children, and allowing them an opportunity to learn, grow, and be an active part of caring for animals has helped shape Pawsitive Care into what it has become today. You can follow us on Facebook at <a href=""https://m.facebook.com/pawsitivecaretx/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://m.facebook.com/pawsitivecaretx/</a></p>
<p>   Pawsitive Care is a member of NAPPS (National Association of Professional Pet Sitters) and IBPSA (International Boarding and Pet Services Association). They provide professional pet sitting, dog walking, in-home boarding, and dog fostering for the South Houston and northern Brazoria County areas. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Do We Need To Grow?</h3>
<p>   As the community around us grows so does the need for quality pet care. Unfortunately, the number of pets in need also follow this trend. The need for fostering dogs became apparent to Ashley while walking dogs in different neighborhoods. She would often find them lost or abandoned, taking them home to house them temporarily until an owner or an adopter was found.</p>
<p>   The number of dogs needing a temporary home greatly outnumbers the places available. Currently, Ashley and her family board dogs from their home located on 1 acre in Manvel, TX and are very limited in the number of dogs that they can care for. By adding a building to board dogs in individual rooms, they can continue to grow and help families in the community while helping dogs in the community find families.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501820402/i2uznr3hsbccaiut9rpm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need</h3>
<p>  <i><strong> Regular kennels are often overcrowded, loud, smelly, and just an overall stressful place to be if you're a dog! </strong></i></p>
<p>    High stress levels can cause physical and emotional harm to dogs no matter where they are. Too often, dogs that board at a regular kennel facility can become fearful of other dogs or become ill from stress and low sanitation standards.</p>
<p>    For those needing to be adopted it can mean a world of difference! Most people don't give a second glance to the sad dog hiding in a corner, the one barking aggressively at the gate, or one who looks unwell. Give that same dog an enriching environment, social interaction, and training- you've got a whole different pup that everyone wants to add to their family!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Dog Haven </h3>
<p>Giving dogs a sense of calm and security is the main focus for building each dog suite- being a home away from home.</p>
<p>    The entire project aims to have 20 individual, climate controlled rooms with 6 being used for foster dogs on a regular basis. Each room will have a dog door that leads to a personal outdoor run so they can go in or out as they please throughout the daytime.</p>
<p>    The project also includes 3 play yards for exercise, socialization, and one-on-one playtime. All play yards will be strongly supervised while in use.</p>

<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Depletion of the world’s oceans has created the need for new, sustainable ways to produce seafood. This has been especially true in the case of shrimp. The world’s natural ecosystem is rapidly being destroyed and almost 95% of the shrimp we eat are now farm raised in open air ponds and imported from Southeast Asia and South America where loose environmental regulations and optimal climates allow for production all year round.</span><br/>

<h2>What is biofloc shrimp farming?</h2>Biofloc shrimp farming facilitates a bacterial community where the bacteria accumulate in clumps called flocs, which break down nitrogenous wastes and turn them into high-protein feed for the shrimp. The flocs process nitrogenous wastes and the shrimp feed on the flocs; this symbiotic relationship stabilizes water quality and supports rapid shrimp growth.<br/>

Waste feed and solids are diverted to clarifying tanks, where the solids settle and clear water is re-circulated back to the grow out tank. The floc also acts as part of the shrimp’s diet throughout the grow out period and the shrimp grow very efficiently, feeding off both the feed and the heterotrophic floc.<br/>

<p></p>
<div><p>But our love affair with shrimp does have a downside. Most of the shrimp we import is “farmed”—grown in huge industrial tanks or shallow, man-made ponds that can stretch for acres. In some cases 150 shrimp can occupy a single square meter (roughly the size of a 60-inch flat-screen television) where they’re fed commercial pellets, sometimes containing antibiotics to ward off disease. If ponds aren’t carefully managed, a sludge of fecal matter, chemicals, and excess food can build up and decay. Wastewater can be periodically discharged into nearby waterways. “Bacteria and algae can begin to grow and disease can set in, prompting farmers to use drugs and other chemicals that can remain on the shrimp and seep into the surrounding environment,” says Urvashi Rangan, Ph.D., executive director of the Consumer Reports Food Safety and Sustainability Center. Those shrimp-farming practices raise a variety of concerns—not just about how safe shrimp are to eat but also about the environmental damage that can be caused by farming them that way.</p></div>
<p></p>
<div><p>For shoppers the dilemma starts at the grocery store, where it’s difficult to know what to buy. <a href=""http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/06/the-lowdown-on-shrimp-labels/index.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Labels</a> and names can be confusing, meaningless, or—worse—deceptive.

<p></p>
<div>
<div>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Despite America’s massive intake of shrimp, the Food and Drug Administration tested only 0.7 percent of foreign shrimp shipments last year. To do our own testing, Consumer Reports bought 342 packages of frozen shrimp—284 raw and 58 cooked samples—at large chain supermarkets, big-box stores, and “natural” food stores in 27 cities across the U.S. (We didn’t include fresh, never-frozen shrimp because they account for only a small percentage of the shrimp that consumers buy.)  </span><br/>
</div>
<p></p>
<div><p>We tested for bacteria such as salmonella, vibrio, staphylococcus aureus, and E. coli. We also looked for drug residues to see whether antibiotics were used in raising the shrimp. Antibiotics—none of which are approved by the U.S. for shrimp farming and which are illegal in imported shrimp—are problematic because their use can ultimately lead to bacteria becoming antibiotic-resistant, meaning that at some point the antibiotic may no longer work to treat common human ailments.</p></div>
<p></p>
<div><p>Our findings provided some cause for concern. In 16 percent of cooked, ready-to-eat shrimp, we found several bacteria, including vibrio and E. coli. Those bacteria can potentially cause illnesses such as food poisoning—which could include diarrhea and dehydration—and, in rare instances, can even prove fatal. In 11 samples of raw imported farmed shrimp, we detected antibiotics. And in seven raw shrimp samples (six farmed and one wild), we found MRSA—methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, a bacteria that can cause infections that are often difficult to treat.</p></div>
<p></p>
<div><p>Overall, 60 percent of our raw shrimp tested positive for bacteria, but it’s important to keep those findings in perspective. By comparison, in 2013, when we tested raw chicken breasts, 97 percent of the samples contained bacteria, says Rangan, who oversaw both the shrimp and chicken studies. Read ""<a href=""http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2014/02/the-high-cost-of-cheap-chicken/index.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The High Cost of Cheap Chicken</a>"" for more details.</p></div>
<p></p>
<div><p>Compared with the chicken samples, far fewer shrimp contained salmonella, which is often responsible for outbreaks of food poisoning. But of concern, we found vibrio on many shrimp samples. “Vibrio is the most common cause of food poisoning from eating raw oysters,” Rangan says. “And even though most bacteria on shrimp would be killed during the cooking process, our test results raise real questions about how shrimp is raised, processed, and regulated.”</p></div>

<h3>Dirty shrimp: What we found</h3>
<p>Consumer Reports tested 284 samples of raw shrimp purchased at stores around the country and tested them for bacterial contamination. The last column shows the percentage of samples that contained at least one of the following bacteria: vibrio, staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, listeria, or salmonella—bacteria that can potentially make you sick. Our experts say more should be done to prevent contamination, but note that cooking should kill the bacteria.</p>

We have the freshest shrimp you can find in Wisconsin! We guarantee fresh, healthy, responsibly-raised shrimp without antibiotics or added chemicals and hormones. Learn more about our shrimp farming process.Dairyland’s shrimp are sold alive and fresh. No chemicals or colorings are necessary to enhance the product, and our shrimp is more flavorful than frozen shrimp from the grocery store. You can feel good about eating our product because it is locally and sustainably grown and does not destroy natural ecosystems like the shrimp found in grocery stores. We have a few tasty shrimp recipes for you to enjoy.The truth about the shrimp you buy in the grocery store
Depletion of the world’s oceans has created the need for new, sustainable ways to produce seafood. This has been especially true in the case of shrimp. The world’s natural ecosystem is rapidly being destroyed and almost 95% of the shrimp we eat are now farm raised in open air ponds and imported from Southeast Asia and South America where loose environmental regulations and optimal climates allow for production all year round.

Viral diseases and challenges from the environmental community toward traditional shrimp farming have been making consumers more aware of shrimp farming’s many flaws like habitat destruction, effluents of contaminated waste water, and use of pesticides and hormones.

Now a new and sustainable way of shrimp farming has evolved that protects shrimp from disease and protects the environment from hazardous shrimp farming practices, creating the possibility that indoor shrimp farming could become the cleanest seafood industry in the world!

What is biofloc shrimp farming?Biofloc shrimp farming facilitates a bacterial community where the bacteria accumulate in clumps called flocs, which break down nitrogenous wastes and turn them into high-protein feed for the shrimp. The flocs process nitrogenous wastes and the shrimp feed on the flocs; this symbiotic relationship stabilizes water quality and supports rapid shrimp growth.
Our processAt Dairyland Shrimp LLC we use a biofloc heterotrophic saltwater system with zero water exchange; we re-circulate our water and therefore do not generate waste water. Waste feed and solids are diverted to clarifying tanks, where the solids settle and clear water is re-circulated back to the grow out tank. The floc also acts as part of the shrimp’s diet throughout the grow out period and the shrimp grow very efficiently, feeding off both the feed and the heterotrophic floc.
Our new facilityWe need your help to fund a sustainable indoor shrimp farming facility that will be completely independent from a power grid. This state of the art facility will implement solar power and geothermal heat. We want are building to be a model to other shrimp farmers to show them just how sustainable and ecofriendly seafood can be.    Here is how geothermal heat works.

Americans love shrimp



Each of us eats, on average, almost 4 pounds per year, making shrimp more popular than tuna. Once considered a special-occasion treat, shrimp has become so ubiquitous that we now expect to find it on the menu whether we’re at a pricey restaurant or a fast-food joint.


In fact, Americans eat about three times more shrimp than we did 35 years ago. To satisfy our insatiable appetite, the U.S. has become a massive importer: About 94 percent of our shrimp supply comes from abroad, from countries such as India, Indonesia, and Thailand.

But our love affair with shrimp does have a downside. Most of the shrimp we import is “farmed”—grown in huge industrial tanks or shallow, man-made ponds that can stretch for acres. In some cases 150 shrimp can occupy a single square meter (roughly the size of a 60-inch flat-screen television) where they’re fed commercial pellets, sometimes containing antibiotics to ward off disease.

<p>Honey Bee One &lt;3</p><br/></div>","Who are we ?

We are a small family based collective, passionate about supplying organic, raw, golden nectar to our local community.
With a past in the holistic health food world, we love to enrich peoples life with top quality nourishment and are keen on green living and harmony with our beautiful earth.
Here at Honey Bee One we would love to establish a a trio of colonies to produce high quality, organic, raw, floral honey. Our ethos is green, friendly and non-invasive.
Your help would give us the boost we need to make a sustainable, ethically responsible, health giving future for us, our local flora and community.

Our Goals and your perks for donating

To achieve our goal we will need £2000. 
This will enable us to purchase:
 5 complete gabled hives made of cedar wood. (2 As anti swarming protection/spares for moving bees  around)
3 Over wintered Queen Bee Nucleus's (A Queen bee, with eggs and drones). 
Body suit, Bee Hat, Gloves, and a few tools to make the job easier.
Our perks include £2000 worth of our pure top quality honey, delivered to your door in small batches as the season changes and as you finish your last batch !
 Large slabs of our delicious honey comb with honey.
Jars of our Pure Honey & Organic Rose Oil Infused Honey.
Organic Bees Wax Candles.

The Impact
Having Bees around us is vital to our existence on this earth.

Bees are in a ""little"" bit of trouble nowadays and they need our support! 
Establishing healthy hives and producing healing products is close to our hearts and we know it would really benefit our local community and planet earth !

Risks & Challenges
With Bees being under threat from an array of chemicals used in agricultrual and industry practice nowadays there is more risk of bees being harmed by humans than ever.

Our bees will be based in the heart of rural somerset surrounded by moorland and wildlife not industrial sites, and large scale agriculture.
We are using a completely organic, non-invasive technique, never harvesting too much honey, meaning not having to feed our bees sugar making for healthier, stronger, happier bees.
Also never culling of bees to prevent swarming, rather allowing them to grow to full capacity and then allowing them to swarm into a neighbouring baited hive (a perfect home for them) ready for them to move straight into.
These methods allow the bees to develop naturally as they like best and minimises disturbance and unnatural substances in their lives.

<h3>The Scoop</h3> <p>Hi!  I'm Natalie Boddeker, the owner and operator of Zest! Juice for Life.  Zest! was started after I watched a documentary called Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead.  It inspired me to go on a 50 day juice fast.  After that, I felt so great that I had to tell everyone I knew about juicing!  Soon, I started holding seminars and found that most people don't want to juice themselves, they would much rather buy it from me!  So, I began making and selling my cold pressed juice blends at the Community Farmers Market in Bowling Green, KY. We get the majority of our produce from our local farmer friends. In the past three years the Zest! team and I have had great success with our little business, but now it's time to grow and have juice available for folks every day of the week!

The reality is, those pictures probably looked like absolute trash but there was something about capturing those moments that captivated my interest in such an intense way. From there I moved into wanting to film everything, from ghetto skateboarding videos with my friends to make believe talk shows. Really just anything we thought would be entertaining to watch over and over again. Now at the ripe age of 25, the majority of my creative outlet is centered around the church I attend, Church of Living Water, located in Olympia, WA.

Before becoming a programmer I was a retailer in New York City, a photographer who studied with Ansel Adams and a teacher.  Nowadays, I just go to music events, work on FestivalTrek and have fun.<br/><br/>

<h1><b>         A little about the Farm</b></h1> <p>    My wife and I have always grown our own food usually nothing but a small garden and whatever we could cram in pots on the porch due to our confined urban settings in Colorado. When we realized we were expecting  our first child we knew it was time to move on to more wide open spaces in hopes to raise our son in the ways of sustainable living and teach him to grow his own food. So I called up my long time friend in southeast Louisiana (where my Brit &amp; I were raised) who had just purchased his family's dairy farm property and asked him if he would be interested in doing a little organic farming.</p>
<p>He was all in.</p>

<p>     With shovels in  hands we packed up our bags and headed back down south to get our hands dirty. We immediately started working the soil and figuring out a good system of growing. After the birth of our son and 2 years of getting the soil where we liked it we have managed to drum up a pretty good following in the community thanks to the local farmers market. Also our neighbor farmers who have helped us every step of the way.</p>
<p>     On the Farm we grow mixed vegetables from potatoes to greens to tomatoes. We are practicing sustainable organic growing techniques including green manure, crop rotation, and compost tea that supplies our community with fresh veggies through the local farmers market year round and through the bi-weekly farm box we will starting this spring.</p>
<p>     Our goal with the high tunnel is to extend our growing season on certain crops that do not fare well in the summer heat and rain in the deep south so we can supply our community with a weekly farm box giving them access to better tasting and healthier food for their families and ours.    </p> </div> <div> <h3>             This is what we need your help for</h3> <p> </p>
<p>                                 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452008744/sa4fsr3p6im86cbs4ic5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <p>  Farming and feeding people is all we have ever wanted to do and with this high tunnel YOU can make this dream  a reality. </p>
<p>    High tunnels are often confused with greenhouses in that they are plastic coverings that protect your plants from the elements. But unlike Greenhouses tunnels are used to cover sensitive crops in rows like tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, cucumbers, and squash (which is what we plan on putting in ours) while greenhouses are mostly used to germinate seeds and prepare transplants.</p>
<p>     High tunnels are structures constructed of a metal frame covered with a single layer of 6 mil greenhouse grade plastic. They have high ceilings which allow us to fit our tractor in and work with ease. Tunnels are a simple, relatively inexpensive, and effective way of protecting sensitive crops from the effects of marginal low to high temperatures, wind, rain ,some insect and disease pests, as well as wildlife damage.</p>
<p>     Upon receiving funding for the high tunnel we will stuff it full of fresh non-gmo organic veggie transplants that we started in the greenhouse to fill our first season of farm boxes.</p>
<p>     We will also be using some of the funding for a new wheel seeder, a walk behind tiller, and pumps for the compost tea system as we will be using compost tea on drip irrigation to fertilize the rows in the high tunnel.</p>

     On the Farm we grow mixed vegetables from potatoes to greens to tomatoes. We are practicing sustainable organic growing techniques including green manure, crop rotation, and compost tea that supplies our community with fresh veggies through the local farmers market year round and through the bi-weekly farm box we will starting this spring.
     Our goal with the high tunnel is to extend our growing season on certain crops that do not fare well in the summer heat and rain in the deep south so we can supply our community with a weekly farm box giving them access to better tasting and healthier food for their families and ours.                    This is what we need your help for  
                                    Farming and feeding people is all we have ever wanted to do and with this high tunnel YOU can make this dream  a reality. 
    High tunnels are often confused with greenhouses in that they are plastic coverings that protect your plants from the elements. But unlike Greenhouses tunnels are used to cover sensitive crops in rows like tomatoes, eggplants, peppers, cucumbers, and squash (which is what we plan on putting in ours) while greenhouses are mostly used to germinate seeds and prepare transplants.
     High tunnels are structures constructed of a metal frame covered with a single layer of 6 mil greenhouse grade plastic. They have high ceilings which allow us to fit our tractor in and work with ease. Tunnels are a simple, relatively inexpensive, and effective way of protecting sensitive crops from the effects of marginal low to high temperatures, wind, rain ,some insect and disease pests, as well as wildlife damage.
     Upon receiving funding for the high tunnel we will stuff it full of fresh non-gmo organic veggie transplants that we started in the greenhouse to fill our first season of farm boxes.
     We will also be using some of the funding for a new wheel seeder, a walk behind tiller, and pumps for the compost tea system as we will be using compost tea on drip irrigation to fertilize the rows in the high tunnel.

<p><b><b></b></b></p><h3><b><b>Help Introduce a Frozen Yogurt Shop in Swaziland</b></b></h3><b>HELP INTRODUCE A
FROZEN YOGURT SHOP IN SWAZILAND</b><p></p>
<p>Hello, my name is
Gcinekile “G” Mavimbela and I am 26 years old from the Kingdom of Swaziland.
Swaziland is a small landlocked country in Southern Africa known for its
wilderness reserves and festivals showcasing traditional Swazi culture. Although
the great attractions, Swaziland is faced with high poverty and a lot of
children lack basic needs such as food,
shelter and clothing. My goal is to find a sustainable way of helping under
privileged children in the country. Therefore, I plan to introduce a frozen
yogurt business and use a proportion of the profits to support orphans in the
country. All your generous gifts towards establishing the frozen yogurt shop
will continuously support Swazi children for generations. </p>
<p>Frozen yogurt will
be a healthy substitute for ice cream in the country for both the local people
and the large number of tourists that the country receives yearly. The shop
will be operated in a city called Ezulwini known for tourist attractions. I
will sell and market a variety of frozen yogurt flavors with natural and
artificial toppings. It will be a self-service, creating a fun and relaxed
atmosphere. </p>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b>Every Contribution Matters!</b></h3><b>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">Frozen yogurt is my
favorite treat in the US and I thought it would be wise to use my favorite
treat to pursue my passion. A generous donor has agreed to match, dollar to
dollar, every gift to this campaign, so your contribution will have double the
impact, $25, 000 raised through this campaign will actually result in $50, 000
towards the cost of the frozen yogurt setup. </span></h3></b><p></p>

country. All your generous gifts towards establishing the frozen yogurt shop
will continuously support Swazi children for generations. 
Frozen yogurt will
be a healthy substitute for ice cream in the country for both the local people
and the large number of tourists that the country receives yearly. The shop
will be operated in a city called Ezulwini known for tourist attractions. I
will sell and market a variety of frozen yogurt flavors with natural and
artificial toppings. It will be a self-service, creating a fun and relaxed
atmosphere. 
Every Contribution Matters!
Frozen yogurt is my
favorite treat in the US and I thought it would be wise to use my favorite
treat to pursue my passion. A generous donor has agreed to match, dollar to
dollar, every gift to this campaign, so your contribution will have double the
impact, $25, 000 raised through this campaign will actually result in $50, 000
towards the cost of the frozen yogurt setup.

After spending years travelling the world, meeting many lovely people and staying in many hostels, I decided it was time to hang up my backpack and create a beautiful place for travellers to relax and feel at home. 


Our hostel is situated in the Rhodope mountains and looks out upon beautiful hills and landscapes.Rather than going for the standard city hostel, we've created something more natural and ecological for our guests to enjoy.

<h3>About Black Rock Legal Defense Fund</h3>
<p>Black Rock Legal Defense Fund was established in 2012 to counter-balance overbearing law enforcement practices inconsistent with
 the letter &amp; spirit of the law, and offensive to upright standards 
of decency and justice with particular emphasis on the fourth and eighth
 amendments. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Not just another Civil Rights group</h3>
<p>While advocacy and lobbying fall within the scope of BRLDF’s mission, this organization aims to affect change in the most direct,
 proactive, and value driven manner possible – by hiring attorneys to 
defend the disadvantaged from criminal prosecution incommensurate with 
their actual violations. Because competent representation can make the 
difference between a minor inconvenience, and a life altering event of 
profound significance.<br/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Legal Defense Fund</h3>
<p>The Black Rock Legal Defense Fund is a unique account that can be 
tapped for providing individual citizens with legal or direct financial 
assistance. Application to the fund is approved by either a small 
committee or the national board, depending on the level of assistance 
sought. The committee works throughout the year raising funds for LDF.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Purpose of the Fund</h3>
<p>The Black Rock Legal Defense Fund collects and distributes 
contributions for aiding citizens in defending the freedom from 
excessive bail, fines, punishment, unreasonable searches or seizures as 
guaranteed by the Eighth and Fourth Amendments of the United States 
Constitution.</p>
<p>The primary role of the Legal Defense Fund is to support the defense 
of disadvantaged individuals facing egregiously exaggerated criminal 
prosecution, which can be the most expensive way to defend the Eighth 
and Fourth Amendments. The fund can also be a source of support for 
coalitions and newsletters, as well as for legislative lobbying 
activities aimed at protecting individuals &amp; their civil rights from
 overbearing intrusion by government authority.</p>
<p>All requests from the Legal Defense Fund will be weighed 
with special consideration for activities that will effect the most 
far-reaching and positive outcomes.</p>
<h3>Community Service</h3>Black Rock Legal Defense fund offers those sentanced to community service the unique opportunity to satisfy that requirement building the infrastructure to advocate for a more humane and rational criminal justice system.<br/><p></p>

<div>Die PonyTruppe Dresden bietet mit ihrem Konzept bereits ganz jungen Pferdefans die Möglichkeit, den Kontakt zu ihrem Lieblingstier herzustellen, alles über es zu lernen und das Körpergefühl, die Balance und Fitness von Kindern durch individuellen Reitunterricht schon in der frühkindlichen Entwicklung zu unterstützen.</div>

Die PonyTruppe Dresden bietet mit ihrem Konzept bereits ganz jungen Pferdefans die Möglichkeit, den Kontakt zu ihrem Lieblingstier herzustellen, alles über es zu lernen und das Körpergefühl, die Balance und Fitness von Kindern durch individuellen Reitunterricht schon in der frühkindlichen Entwicklung zu unterstützen.
Hierbei geben wir nicht einfach nur Reitstunden. Jeder Reitschüler übernimmt auch die Vorbereitung seines Pferdes auf den Reitunterricht.
Weiterhin unterstützen wir mit Lehrgängen Konzentrations- und Begeisterungsfähigkeit auf die Altersgruppen abgestimmt, und fördern Charaktereigenschaften wie Verantwortungsbewusstsein, Toleranz, Selbstbewusstsein und Fairness. Die Arbeit mit Pferden eignet sich hier hervorragend.
Dank einem großen Zuspruch wollen wir den Schritt auf ein eigenes Gelände wagen und dort ein Paradies für Kinder entstehen lassen. Gegenwärtig nutzen wir noch die Vorteile einer hervorragenden Anlage, sind jedoch zu stark gewachsen um dort bleiben zu können.
Mit den durch die Kampagne erzielten Mitteln, werden die Investitionen für das Reitparadies vervollständigt. Wir möchten unsere speziell auf die Förderung von Reitanfängern, egal welchen Alters, abgeschnittenen Pläne umsetzen. 
In unseren Videos und generell auf dem Videokanal der PonyTruppe, können Sie zusätzlich in unsere Arbeit reinschnuppern.


Was wir für Sie umsetzen


Die wesentlichen Bestandteile der Finanzierung liegen im Bau eines Offenstalls für artgerechte Pferdehaltung, in der Sicherung der Tier und Einzäunung des Areals und im Anlegen des Reitplatzes:
  Der Stall, bzw das Hauptgebäude befindet sich auf einem schwebenden Fundament und ist von einem Dachdeckermeister konzipiert.  Auf diese Weise können wir nicht nur sicher stellen, dass es sich um einen durchdachten Bau handelt, wir haben zusätzlich immer die Chance das Gebäude zu transportieren, zu verändern und bei Modernisierung zu verkaufen.

Für diese Investitionen benötigen wir Ihre Hilfe.


Die Folgen


Mit der Umsetzung der Pläne schaffen wir gemeinsam ein Areal, auf dem unsere Kinder und mit Ihnen natürlich auch deren Familien sich sinnvoll in ihrer Freizeit beschäftigen können. Auf dem eigenen Gelände können wir optimale Haltungsbedingungen für unsere Pferde, Flexibilität in der Terminvergabe und einen Standort für mehr tolle Veranstaltungen bieten, als dies unsere Kunden jetzt schon von uns gewöhnt sind.

Risiken & Herausforderungen
Die PonyTruppe Dresden ist sich der Herausforderungen des Projektes bewusst und scheut keine Mühen diese zu bewältigen.
Neben der artgerechten Versorgung unserer Tiere, steht die Zufriedenstellung unserer Kunden im Vordergrund.
Die größte Herausforderung liegt dabei in der Personalplanung. Der neue Standort ist gut zu erreichen und ermöglicht  uns bessere Chancen auf Fachkräfte.
Dem Einfluss von Schlechtwetterzeiten werden wir vor allem mittels des besonderen Reitplatzbodens, aber auch durch einen beheizten Aufenthaltsraum entgegenwirken.

</h3>
<p>Nearly two years ago, I dropped out of university, becoming one of millions of university students around the world who, for various reasons, drop out before graduation year. In my case, it was familial financial constraints. To sustain me in school hundreds of miles away, my family sometimes went without food. Sometimes, from the little that I earned from a writing stint, I sent home. Dropping out became inevitable. One morning, I applied for an indefinite break and headed home with one objective: find a job. Anything. My graduation year would have been 2017. </p>
<p>Having worked for three years after high school to save up for university, dropping out barely half way into my three and a half year journalism course at <a href=""http://www.usiu.ac.ke/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">USIU</a>, Nairobi, Kenya, quickly set me on a path of emotional breakdown. It had all ended faster than it had started; one moment I was a hopeful freshman keen on finishing school in record time... the next, I was stuffing my few belongings in a bag and heading home.</p>
<p>Once home, I was back at a familiar place of uncertainty. It was that uncertainty that had led me to find work after high school in a bid to save up for university education. Within three years, I learned and worked my way into becoming a prime-time radio newscaster at <a href=""http://www.radiocity.ug/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Radiocity 97FM</a>, despite being without any kind of university or college training. A year and a half after I enrolled for university, what made dropping out particularly hard was not that I needed school to discover myself or my potential but the fact that with the break, my ultimate journalistic dreams were taking a back seat, again. Nevertheless, blinded by the urge to help my family, I started the knocking. Door after door. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>It wasn't long before I was reminded of the sole reason why I have always wanted to get done with school. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Despite my experience, proven ability to learn fast and passion, that I didn't have a degree was something many employers fronted as the only reason why they couldn't take me on. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Meanwhile, things were either the same at home or deteriorating; my young brother soon dropped out of high school in order for my sister to continue with her IT degree. She is currently in her second year. Something positive. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">With my job search yielding nothing, alongside whatever my parents could raise, I used my small savings to start up a 300-bird chicken project. Given my limited capital base, it soon ran into setbacks that thinned the already marginal profits. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Frustrated, I slowly drowned deeper in my own mental pool of worry. What started as occasional lack of sleep and mild headaches soon grew into something more serious: depression. It wasn't just about my dreams but even those of my two siblings. I worried that they were doomed to the same fate. I was angry about how things had turned out for my parents; they'd toiled selflessly for others but had little to show for their laudable efforts. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">After months of <i>almosts, </i>my current $600 p.m job came. Since November 2015, I have worked as the online content editor at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/nbstelevision/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NBS Television</a>, a leading player in Uganda's broadcasting industry. Getting the job brought much-needed relief; it came with a chance of being back in a newsroom, human contact... it gave me a shield against my worries, aided my healing process and above all else, a shot at survival. </span></p>
<p>But I don't want to survive. I watched my father survive and sacrifice for his family my entire life. I want more than to survive. </p>
<p><b>Fishing My Dreams...</b></p>
<p>Ultimately, I want to start up a production company to tell the many untold stories of Uganda and Africa at large. In between, I want to position myself better by finishing school; I want not to be told that I am the perfect person for the job save for the fact that I lack a mere paper. Being in a position to help out my family, though limited, brings joy but I don't want that to be the reason why my own dreams sink down into oblivion with each passing day.</p>
<p>That is why I am asking for help. I seek a total of US$3,325 (the exact equivalent of UGX11.1M) to start up a fish farm, an 8-month project capable of fivefold profitability. </p>
<p>As per this breakdown drawn up by Geossy Ltd, US$1,797 (UGX6M) would be spent on constructing a 125 m3 cage with a holding capacity of 10,000 heads of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilapia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tilapia</a>. Fish feeding equipment and a boat are also covered. </p>
<p>The US$1,527 (UGX5.1M) buys the Tilapia fingerlings, the feeds and labour for the 8-month  growth process. </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>As shown below, US$3,325 (UGX11.1M), over a period of eight months yields a production cycle revenue of US$15,099 (UGX50.4M) and net profits totalling to US$11,773 (UGX39.3M). These figures factor in a mortality rate of 10% (1,000 of the 10,000 heads) and a per kilogramme US$2 (UGX8,000) price for the projected 6,300kgs <i>harvestable </i>after the eight months. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460873251/kdjfjf_lyxwgz.png"" src="""" style=""width: 598.415px;height: 660px;""/></p>
<br/><p>It would take me five months of saving every penny I currently earn to raise the money I need for this project. If only I could. It would take me two whole years, as per my current salary scheme to save up the equivalent of the profits that this project forecasts within eight months. </p>
<p>With the money, the plan is to use the initial cage to fund a minimum of 5 cages within three years. The cage will be constructed at home where there is enough space for at least one such cage. Eventually, I intend to buy some land to accommodate expansion or apply for a license to farm on Lake Victoria. </p>
<p><b>What your contribution will help me achieve...</b></p>
<p>Apart from achieving the main goal of starting the project and funding it until the time when mature fish will be pulled out of the cage, the outcome of the project is one of hope. Hope that I will be able to afford finishing school, pay for my siblings' education and support my parents who're both not earning any money. Hope that with fewer needs to worry about, my own recovery process would be aided. Hope that within a few years, I will be able to afford the resources needed to start up and run a production house. Hope that even amid efforts to help my family, my own dreams will not be lost in the process. </p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>A Who and A Where?</h3> <p>I, Jonathan, started 310HIGHROAD in Los Angeles, CA as a way to increase the overall employee health and lifestyle while providing consumers with the most direct and personal furniture shopping experience he could think of. Subconsciously for the past 5+ years, I have been brainstorming in a way that will change the work force and ecommerce experience for the better. My background in customer service and operational functions at previous places of employment have helped develop 310HIGHROAD into what it is today.</p>
<p>The 310HIGHROAD campaign was started out of a necessity to improve overall mental and physical health in creating new things, while doing what I do best - giving back and helping others. I am developing a way for employees to be more productive with less of the stress factors of life, while improving the customer service and ecommerce buying experience for furniture and home goods or accessories. The campaign is so near and dear to my heart, I named the company after the address of the home I grew up in. There's something about that brick home back in the suburbs of Chicago that was always so inviting, relaxing, loving, and comforting that I am able to close my eyes and pretend I am sitting in the living room with the summer breeze blowing through the house, the birds outside are chirping at the squirrels on the bird feeder, the dogs are barking at who knows what, cows across the street are mooing, and mom is in the kitchen preparing the pot roast for dinner.  <br/></p>
<p>I'm sure some of you reading this are instantly taken back to that home with me. Can you smell the flowers and feel the breeze as it blows through the house? Do you hear the birds? Do you look outside the window and smile from the sunshine hitting your face? That's what home is and I want to share that with everyone. How we're raised, where we're raised, and how comfortable you feel inside your home are extremely important to your overall health. I will replicate that exact idea through 310HIGHROAD on both ends - one for the consumer in their shopping experience and purchases and the other for the employee in their workplace atmosphere. As a contributor, you will help make this dream a reality.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Simply put...Think of us as a personal design ecommerce presence that will handle all of your decorating needs. We will be there through every step of the way offering design consultations and advice from on staff professionals. Our team of experts will also manage the ecommerce store based on your particular interests - colors, concepts, particular furniture eras, re-purposing ideas for items you've found on our site, vintage furniture sourcing, and so much more! The possibilities of what 310HIGHROAD will be able to offer you are limitless. </h3>
<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Your Home. Your Lifestyle. Here's the ""deets""<br/>
</h3> <p>Listen, I'll be honest. I can't do this alone and quite frankly, I don't want to. I like be surrounded by people who are looking out for the good and success in others.</p>
<p>Currently, my goal of $125,000 will be directly related to building the brand and all it encompasses.<br/>~$10,000 will go directly to strategically building out the website and phone apps for a streamlined eCommerce buying experience. I want to be as detailed as possible for consumers - think of it as a personal shopping experience for your home. Need design help? Call, text, email, smoke signal us - I want to be there to help! <br/>~$35,000 is going to secure one hell of a building and office environment. Each office inside the building will be dedicated to a room in a home (whoever gets the bathroom as their office, I will make sure it is only a showroom and NOT in working order). Working with our furniture and home goods suppliers, I would love the skilled and hand-picked team to receive a quarterly budget to make their office as inviting as possible. Imagine now you're in your living room at home, but thinking of the company atmosphere - what would you like to see? Grab a vendor catalog and place an order - make 310HIGHROAD like your home.<br/>~$10,000 will be used to concept a 310HIGHROAD collection of furniture and home goods line, but will also be used to secure immediate furniture sales for the eCommerce buying experience.  <br/>~$10,000 has to go towards supplies, marketing, and normal office admin expenses. <br/>~$60,000 will make the future a success as we build the brand and secure employment. Think of it as a secure piggy bank for the company to be financially responsible and consistent.</p>
<p>In case we don't reach our exact goal, the funds will be evenly distributed on a percentage basis across the board. The funding topics above are the heart and soul of the company and deserve attention. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Perk Me Up!<br/>
</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><p>Who doesn't love a perk? I know I do. Look what's in store for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>A personalized Thank You postcard from Jonathan</li>
<li>Helping Mother Earth breathe life with freshly planted flowers or trees at the new office</li>
<li>Stainless steel reusable water bottles</li>
<li>Sturdy reusable tote bags</li>
<li>Large proud backer stamps the company will use on outgoing packages in your name</li>
<li>Hand-picked box of your interests in furniture and/or home goods <br/>
</li>
<li>A room inside our ""home"" office named after you</li>
<li>Free ground shipping up to 6 months</li>
<li>A piece of furniture or home good named after you and the first one off the production line!</li>
<li>To be a part of history and 310HIGHROAD forever<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Hurdles We Face:<br/>
</h3> <p>To keep with being honest - there's a lot at stake. I am deeply appreciative of everyone who contributes and everyone who believes in me, but it will be my sole responsibility to keep the company running and employees happy. Spending time running through the ""what if"" questions in my head is enough to drive me crazy, but then I stop and think the ""what if"" turns into <i>What if we are so successful as a brand and lifestyle, all employees receive more time off or are guaranteed a bonus</i>? That's what make me happy.</p>
<p> Writing everything down, planning for the future, accounting for growth, looking at all possible obstacles - this will help make a strong foundation for what the company stands for and plans to execute.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Contribution for 310HIGHROAD is not solely monetary.</h3>

I, Jonathan, started 310HIGHROAD in Los Angeles, CA as a way to increase the overall employee health and lifestyle while providing consumers with the most direct and personal furniture shopping experience he could think of. Subconsciously for the past 5+ years, I have been brainstorming in a way that will change the work force and ecommerce experience for the better. My background in customer service and operational functions at previous places of employment have helped develop 310HIGHROAD into what it is today.
The 310HIGHROAD campaign was started out of a necessity to improve overall mental and physical health in creating new things, while doing what I do best - giving back and helping others. I am developing a way for employees to be more productive with less of the stress factors of life, while improving the customer service and ecommerce buying experience for furniture and home goods or accessories. The campaign is so near and dear to my heart, I named the company after the address of the home I grew up in. There's something about that brick home back in the suburbs of Chicago that was always so inviting, relaxing, loving, and comforting that I am able to close my eyes and pretend I am sitting in the living room with the summer breeze blowing through the house, the birds outside are chirping at the squirrels on the bird feeder, the dogs are barking at who knows what, cows across the street are mooing, and mom is in the kitchen preparing the pot roast for dinner.  
I'm sure some of you reading this are instantly taken back to that home with me. Can you smell the flowers and feel the breeze as it blows through the house? Do you hear the birds? Do you look outside the window and smile from the sunshine hitting your face? That's what home is and I want to share that with everyone. How we're raised, where we're raised, and how comfortable you feel inside your home are extremely important to your overall health. I will replicate that exact idea through 310HIGHROAD on both ends - one for the consumer in their shopping experience and purchases and the other for the employee in their workplace atmosphere. As a contributor, you will help make this dream a reality.

Simply put...Think of us as a personal design ecommerce presence that will handle all of your decorating needs. We will be there through every step of the way offering design consultations and advice from on staff professionals. Our team of experts will also manage the ecommerce store based on your particular interests - colors, concepts, particular furniture eras, re-purposing ideas for items you've found on our site, vintage furniture sourcing, and so much more! The possibilities of what 310HIGHROAD will be able to offer you are limitless. 

  Your Home. Your Lifestyle. Here's the ""deets""
 Listen, I'll be honest. I can't do this alone and quite frankly, I don't want to. I like be surrounded by people who are looking out for the good and success in others.
Currently, my goal of $125,000 will be directly related to building the brand and all it encompasses.~$10,000 will go directly to strategically building out the website and phone apps for a streamlined eCommerce buying experience. I want to be as detailed as possible for consumers - think of it as a personal shopping experience for your home. Need design help? Call, text, email, smoke signal us - I want to be there to help! ~$35,000 is going to secure one hell of a building and office environment. Each office inside the building will be dedicated to a room in a home (whoever gets the bathroom as their office, I will make sure it is only a showroom and NOT in working order). Working with our furniture and home goods suppliers, I would love the skilled and hand-picked team to receive a quarterly budget to make their office as inviting as possible. Imagine now you're in your living room at home, but thinking of the company atmosphere - what would you like to see? Grab a vendor catalog and place an order - make 310HIGHROAD like your home.~$10,000 will be used to concept a 310HIGHROAD collection of furniture and home goods line, but will also be used to secure immediate furniture sales for the eCommerce buying experience.  ~$10,000 has to go towards supplies, marketing, and normal office admin expenses. ~$60,000 will make the future a success as we build the brand and secure employment. Think of it as a secure piggy bank for the company to be financially responsible and consistent.
In case we don't reach our exact goal, the funds will be evenly distributed on a percentage basis across the board. The funding topics above are the heart and soul of the company and deserve attention. 

Perk Me Up!

Who doesn't love a perk? I know I do. Look what's in store for you:

A personalized Thank You postcard from Jonathan
Helping Mother Earth breathe life with freshly planted flowers or trees at the new office
Stainless steel reusable water bottles
Sturdy reusable tote bags
Large proud backer stamps the company will use on outgoing packages in your name
Hand-picked box of your interests in furniture and/or home goods 

A room inside our ""home"" office named after you
Free ground shipping up to 6 months
A piece of furniture or home good named after you and the first one off the production line!
To be a part of history and 310HIGHROAD forever





Hurdles We Face:
 To keep with being honest - there's a lot at stake. I am deeply appreciative of everyone who contributes and everyone who believes in me, but it will be my sole responsibility to keep the company running and employees happy. Spending time running through the ""what if"" questions in my head is enough to drive me crazy, but then I stop and think the ""what if"" turns into What if we are so successful as a brand and lifestyle, all employees receive more time off or are guaranteed a bonus? That's what make me happy.
 Writing everything down, planning for the future, accounting for growth, looking at all possible obstacles - this will help make a strong foundation for what the company stands for and plans to execute.

    Contribution for 310HIGHROAD is not solely monetary.
Although a monetary contribution helps - spreading the word about 310HIGHROAD is the greatest compliment I could think of. From the bottom of my heart - I will not give up on you and thank you in advance for even taking the time to read the campaign.

Our Solution. 



Locally built and globally financed, mNaukri combines the sucesses of the past and the present to build trust, connect communities, and empower through employment. We connect slum residents to local employment opportunities that are individually catered to their needs, more often than not jobs that are task-oriented, short-term, easy to complete.

<h1>What You Get</h1> <p style=""text-align: justify;"">  Besides getting some pretty awesome perks from us for contributing to our campaign, this project gives back in a variety ways. Not only are you helping a small business thrive and providing a local community more access to fresh and sustainable food, you are making it possible for small farms around the world to make a big impact on the local food movement. New farmers are necessary for our future in food as the average age of an American farmer is 57, and getting older every year. To reverse this course, we must take bold action to ensure that aspiring farmers have access to land, health care, capital, education and training. By helping The Tiny Acre, you are helping all beginning farmers become the next generation of farmers our country so desperately needs. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">  You don't have to be local to feel good about helping our campaign. We have partnered with a local food pantry, so any perks redeemed that come with produce can be donated to them if you are unable to come to the farm yourself. </p>

  With your help (and a little elbow grease) we want to build a greenhouse on the farm to vastly expand the potential of our second growing season, and beyond. A large greenhouse at The Tiny Acre will allow us to:  Increase our CSA capacity from 15 members, to 40. That means providing 40 families with fresh, local produce all season long!  Become full-time vendors at two farmers markets (Spring, Summer & Fall).
House 40 additional tomato plants during peak Summer season as a bumper crop. Grow vegetables year round, making local produce more accessible to our community in the colder months.

   What We Need   To reach our goal, we have proposed a budget of $2500. These funds get broken down into 4 categories:  
Greenhouse build-out (all materials for framework, metal poles, lumber, poly film, gables ends, hardware etc.)

Propagation materials (seed trays, flats, heating mats, seeding mix, germination chamber ect).

Shelving (enough greenhouse benches to fit 60 seedling trays).

Miscellaneous expenses (hosing, hand tools, thermometer, fans, tomato trellising etc.) 

  

  If we exceed our goal, additional funds from this campaign will go towards upgrades on the greenhouse such as a heater and more propagation space as well as renovating existing garage space here on the farm for a farm stand open weekly to the public. 



What You Get   Besides getting some pretty awesome perks from us for contributing to our campaign, this project gives back in a variety ways. Not only are you helping a small business thrive and providing a local community more access to fresh and sustainable food, you are making it possible for small farms around the world to make a big impact on the local food movement. New farmers are necessary for our future in food as the average age of an American farmer is 57, and getting older every year. To reverse this course, we must take bold action to ensure that aspiring farmers have access to land, health care, capital, education and training. By helping The Tiny Acre, you are helping all beginning farmers become the next generation of farmers our country so desperately needs. 
  You don't have to be local to feel good about helping our campaign. We have partnered with a local food pantry, so any perks redeemed that come with produce can be donated to them if you are unable to come to the farm yourself. 


   


    Other Ways You Can Help Just because you can't contribute, doesn't mean you can't be part of our success. Other great ways to help us reach our goal:  Make some noise about it! Scream about it! Dance about it! SHARE SHARE SHARE and don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools!


Thank you so much for reading about our journey and we hope to see everyone this upcoming season, whether it be at the farm or at a farmer's market. We are very excited!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>In July of 2015, I had the good fortune to take
over a small 34 seat café in a Davidson Business Courtyard in my hometown,
Smiths Falls Ontario. I thought this was a perfect opportunity to promote local
foods by creating menu items from farmers and growers, so in August, Café 7
West opened its doors again with a new menu and a fresher approach to food!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466092699/12916971_862337293891654_8270748689507274860_o_lpqy1c.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I created a 'localcentric' menu using local food
distributor, Wendy's Mobile Market of Lyndhurst Ontario for access to beef,
pork, chicken, eggs, greens vegetables, cheese and more from local producers. I
chose a secondary supplier, J Quattrocchi, a local wholesale food distributor that
has been operating since 1922 right here in Smiths Falls.  I have received
tremendous support from Two Rivers Food Hub and have established clientele from
the local community as well as local food enthusiasts from surrounding towns
and cities including Almonte, Brockville, Kemptville, Kingston, Lanark,
Merrickville, Napanee and Perth. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466092735/12901543_853476151444435_1352818807368485831_o_irv0y4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My challenge creating a menu with fresh foods in a

I purchased tables from a local re-use store, The Real Deal and refinished them
(actually my very supportive father did this for me). My parents gifted our
family harvest kitchen table and benches (a communal table near electrical
outlets for laptops), and a former landlord sold me chairs he was no longer
using. I have managed to cover the unexpected costs of new plumbing after realizing
the pipes had frozen and the recent electrical work that had been started and
never finished. Additional cosmetic work has been done to pretty the place up

<ul>
<li>Clackamas River Outfitters was founded in 2015 with a goal to expand the paddling opportunities on the Clackamas River. For years, private boaters have enjoyed the Clackamas River's scenic flat water and whitewater stretches. However, without the availability of a local source to rent gear, get instruction, or book a tour, access to more potential users has been limited. <i> </i>
</li>
<li>Clackamas River Outfitters has partnered with PGE (Portland General Electric) to expand our paddling rentals, tours, and instruction to Promontory Park. This spring, CRO will open our second location at the marina! Our expanded business will offer customers a second location, additional amenities, and more square miles to paddle. Now, is your opportunity to participate in the growth of Oregon's outdoor recreational activities by participating in building a vibrant paddling community on the scenic Clackamas River! </li>
</ul>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460686574/Screenshot_2016-04-14_14.43.02_wedjeg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<ul>
<li>Your generous contributions will help us grow our small business and expand sustainable recreation, conservation education, and allow more people too experience the Wild &amp; Scenic Clackamas River in a low impact manner. </li>
<li>By funding CRO's campaign, you will be directly assisting in expansion of sustainable recreation on the Wild &amp; Scenic Clackamas River while simultaneously supporting vibrancy of the local economy. Choosing to contribute will result in the availability of fun, healthy and sustainable recreational opportunities. Our passion for paddling is matched by our connection to the natural world. We believe that by spending more time outdoors, we become more connected to our understanding of how the natural world supports our lives in so many wonderful ways and how what we do impacts the natural and wild places that sustain us.</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get<span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;""> </span>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>CRO is working hard to raise $15,000. These funds will go directly back into the expansion of our business. More specifically, your contribution will help us grow our kayak and paddleboard fleet and expand our marketing potential.   </li>
</ul>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460687084/12049580_904373879615704_7708887950596869556_n_xyf3pu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<ul>
<li>In the event that we don't reach our entire goal…this campaign will still have been a success. The exposure our business will gain from this campaign is positive movement forward! Any funds will be used to obtain additional rentals so that we are able to provide quality access to paddling for CRO's second location. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>This project is especially valuable to increasing use and awareness of our natural world. With the current status of climate and and water issues, we feel that our work is one of not only providing fun paddling activities but connecting people to what ultimately sustains us. We want contributors to know they will be assisting in the vibrancy of the local economy by supporting small sustainable business.</li>
<li>Last year was our first season in business. We were successful in fulfilling all our goals in the first year of operation. In a short period of time, we were able to secure funding, organize the structure and operational side of business and effectively execute our goals - a high quality, on-water kayak and paddleboard rental, tour and instruction business.

Clackamas River Outfitters was founded in 2015 with a goal to expand the paddling opportunities on the Clackamas River. For years, private boaters have enjoyed the Clackamas River's scenic flat water and whitewater stretches. However, without the availability of a local source to rent gear, get instruction, or book a tour, access to more potential users has been limited.  

Clackamas River Outfitters has partnered with PGE (Portland General Electric) to expand our paddling rentals, tours, and instruction to Promontory Park. This spring, CRO will open our second location at the marina! Our expanded business will offer customers a second location, additional amenities, and more square miles to paddle. Now, is your opportunity to participate in the growth of Oregon's outdoor recreational activities by participating in building a vibrant paddling community on the scenic Clackamas River! 



Your generous contributions will help us grow our small business and expand sustainable recreation, conservation education, and allow more people too experience the Wild & Scenic Clackamas River in a low impact manner. 
By funding CRO's campaign, you will be directly assisting in expansion of sustainable recreation on the Wild & Scenic Clackamas River while simultaneously supporting vibrancy of the local economy. Choosing to contribute will result in the availability of fun, healthy and sustainable recreational opportunities. Our passion for paddling is matched by our connection to the natural world. We believe that by spending more time outdoors, we become more connected to our understanding of how the natural world supports our lives in so many wonderful ways and how what we do impacts the natural and wild places that sustain us.
   What We Need & What You Get 


CRO is working hard to raise $15,000. These funds will go directly back into the expansion of our business. More specifically, your contribution will help us grow our kayak and paddleboard fleet and expand our marketing potential.   



In the event that we don't reach our entire goal…this campaign will still have been a success. The exposure our business will gain from this campaign is positive movement forward! Any funds will be used to obtain additional rentals so that we are able to provide quality access to paddling for CRO's second location.     The Impact

This project is especially valuable to increasing use and awareness of our natural world. With the current status of climate and and water issues, we feel that our work is one of not only providing fun paddling activities but connecting people to what ultimately sustains us. We want contributors to know they will be assisting in the vibrancy of the local economy by supporting small sustainable business.
Last year was our first season in business. We were successful in fulfilling all our goals in the first year of operation. In a short period of time, we were able to secure funding, organize the structure and operational side of business and effectively execute our goals - a high quality, on-water kayak and paddleboard rental, tour and instruction business. We were able to re-invest in our company in the first season and change negative usage patterns for the better in an area that had previously been underutilized.
We LOVE what we do and want to share it with others in a meaningful way. The ability to increase our rental fleet will secure our operational viability and allow us to provide more access to paddling opportunities to more people.

<div>[ENGLISH SUMMARY BELOW]</div>Eindhoven krijgt er een leuk plekje bij, als het aan ons ligt. In de loop van december opent op Bergstraat 35 in Eindhoven de kaas- en delicatessenwinkel Jokkmokk zijn deuren. Bij Jokkmokk kun je terecht voor mooie kazen en lekkere delicatessen waarbij vooral de passie van de makers en de smaak centraal zullen staan. Voor een ambachtelijke Hollandse boerenkaas, een lekkere schapenkaas uit de streek, een pittige blauwe kaas, een traditionele cheddar, de mooiste Franse kaasjes en nog veel meer kazen zul je hier terecht kunnen. En voor meer, uh, ja, dinges dus....<p></p> </div><div>Jokkmokk heeft een zwak voor streekproducten, maar ook voor traditie, kleine gepassioneerde makers en natuurlijk voor hele lekkere smaken. Biologisch kan dan een plus zijn, ongepasteuriseerd is dat zeker. Maar voorop staan de zintuigen. Lekker, mooi, welriekend (of niet) en met een scala aan structuren zal het kaasaanbod weldoordacht maar niet buitensporig groot zijn. Iedere kaas heeft een verhaal, die verhalen willen we gaan vertellen, en dat kunnen we waarschijnlijk beter als het over 40 kazen gaat dan wanneer het over 200 stuks gaat.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Wat hebben we nodig</h3> <p>Een deel van de financiering is rond. Om die hele mooie kazen en lekkernijen naar Eindhoven te krijgen is echter nog extra geld nodig. Jij kunt daarbij helpen. Als je nu helpt het bedrag wat nog nodig is rond te krijgen krijg je je inleg terug in kaas (of wijn, of olie, of uh, dinges). Als je niet vaak in Eindhoven komt, kunnen we het ook in de vorm van een lening doen die je over drie jaar met rente (6% per jaar) terugkrijgt.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Waar gaat het geld in zitten?</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>Mede door jouw bijdrage kan het volgende tot stand gaan komen:</p> <ul> <li>een mooi assortiment, bestaande uit streekproducten, ongepasteuriseerde Holandse kazen, kazen en producten van verder weg die met heel veel passie zijn gemaakt en alle verhalen die daarbij horen.</li> <li>een mooi ingericht winkelpand waarin die producten mooi tot zijn recht kunnen komen.</li> <li>de armslag om ook in promotie en communicatie te investeren zodat er ruchtbaarheid komt over deze mooie plek in de even mooie Bergstraat.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risico's</h3> <p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Als het geld niet voor 100% ingezameld kan worden, dan betekent het dat een paar onderdelen van de winkel in fases gerealiseerd zullen gaan worden.

</div></div>","JOKKMOKK - kaas & dinges 
[ENGLISH SUMMARY BELOW]Eindhoven krijgt er een leuk plekje bij, als het aan ons ligt. In de loop van december opent op Bergstraat 35 in Eindhoven de kaas- en delicatessenwinkel Jokkmokk zijn deuren. Bij Jokkmokk kun je terecht voor mooie kazen en lekkere delicatessen waarbij vooral de passie van de makers en de smaak centraal zullen staan. Voor een ambachtelijke Hollandse boerenkaas, een lekkere schapenkaas uit de streek, een pittige blauwe kaas, een traditionele cheddar, de mooiste Franse kaasjes en nog veel meer kazen zul je hier terecht kunnen. En voor meer, uh, ja, dinges dus.... Jokkmokk heeft een zwak voor streekproducten, maar ook voor traditie, kleine gepassioneerde makers en natuurlijk voor hele lekkere smaken. Biologisch kan dan een plus zijn, ongepasteuriseerd is dat zeker. Maar voorop staan de zintuigen. Lekker, mooi, welriekend (of niet) en met een scala aan structuren zal het kaasaanbod weldoordacht maar niet buitensporig groot zijn. Iedere kaas heeft een verhaal, die verhalen willen we gaan vertellen, en dat kunnen we waarschijnlijk beter als het over 40 kazen gaat dan wanneer het over 200 stuks gaat.
  Wat hebben we nodig Een deel van de financiering is rond. Om die hele mooie kazen en lekkernijen naar Eindhoven te krijgen is echter nog extra geld nodig. Jij kunt daarbij helpen. Als je nu helpt het bedrag wat nog nodig is rond te krijgen krijg je je inleg terug in kaas (of wijn, of olie, of uh, dinges). Als je niet vaak in Eindhoven komt, kunnen we het ook in de vorm van een lening doen die je over drie jaar met rente (6% per jaar) terugkrijgt.
Waar gaat het geld in zitten?
 Mede door jouw bijdrage kan het volgende tot stand gaan komen:  een mooi assortiment, bestaande uit streekproducten, ongepasteuriseerde Holandse kazen, kazen en producten van verder weg die met heel veel passie zijn gemaakt en alle verhalen die daarbij horen. een mooi ingericht winkelpand waarin die producten mooi tot zijn recht kunnen komen. de armslag om ook in promotie en communicatie te investeren zodat er ruchtbaarheid komt over deze mooie plek in de even mooie Bergstraat.    Risico's Als het geld niet voor 100% ingezameld kan worden, dan betekent het dat een paar onderdelen van de winkel in fases gerealiseerd zullen gaan worden. Het betekent dus niet dat JOKKMOKK er niet komt. €4500,- is als streefbedrag bepaald, meer is  zeker welkom en kan goed gebruikt worden voor nog meer mooie dingen.

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>Between the wild wind and the babbling brook is where our little farm is stood.</p>
<p>It started with a dream to become more self sufficient and to live closer to the land. To grow our own food and to have a gentler footprint on the earth. It has since become so much more than the dream of self sufficiency. It has become a realisation that we are connected to our food in a way that todays world has almost lost sight of, and an awareness of how we are connected to our planet, and how we can benefit nature through raising animals in an ethical and sustainable way that complements nature and its resources. </p>
<p>Here at Windbrook Farm we have a small milking herd of Jämtland goats, a native Swedish breed which is at risk of endangerment. Our goats are fed on pasture and ecological grain, we have Linderöd pigs, another native Swedish breed, also an endangered breed. Our pigs live free range in the forest, and have several hectares of grazing forest to roam. We also raise a growing flock of hens for both meat and eggs. We keep a variety of hens, Hedemora, Orpington crosses, Brahmas and a couple of other cross breeds. </p>
<p>We have built up the farm over the past four years, and invested our own time, energy and money into making it what it is today. We use sustainable practices, encourage biodiversity, and actively choose to work with techniques such as Holistic Management, Permaculture, and Regenerative Agriculture.</p>

We are expanding our little farm so it includes a farm shop where we can sell our own products and products from farms near by.</p>
<p>Late last spring, we were taking the dog for a walk in our village, and walked a different way than usual, it was then that we came upon a worn down old house, standing quietly set back from the road. where once it would have stood proudly in the centre of the village. Walking up to the dusty window to look in, inside it was a time capsule of days gone by. There, this once grand building has stood, unloved and untouched for 40 years. We decided right then, we wanted to breathe life back into this old country store, and bought it straight away.<br/><br/></p>

<h4>The Goats</h4>
<p>Just now we have 4 beautiful goats in our herd, we are going to increase our goat family to 10 milk goats, plus babies once they have a new home to move into. They will have the freedom to free range in the forest, and have a good happy life exploring all day long. The goats have a totally organic and local diet of hay grown on our own land, free grazing in the forest and supplemented with organic grain, grown in a neighbouring village.<br/><br/></p>

<br/><h4>The chickens</h4>
<p>We currently have 10 chickens on the farm, all for egg production. This year we are growing our chicken flock to 50 laying hens and 100+ meat birds. They will have full access to the land to scratch up and help rejuvenate the soil, they will also have full access to the forest, and allowed to live as natural of a life as possible. <br/><br/></p>

<br/><h4>The Pigs</h4>
<p>The pigs live a happy free range life in the forest, they have a very natural life, how pigs should live, free of confinement. They spend their days foraging, sleeping and playing. They help the forest to stay healthy whilst being happy and healthy themselves. Life is stress free. Happy pigs provide us with good happy meat. We have three breeding sows, and expecting our first litter of piglets very soon. <br/><br/></p>

How the funds raised will be used

Conversion of the old hay barn into a chicken house
Replacing the leaking roof and fixing the water damage
Fitting an approved production kitchen
Starting work on the micro dairy and milking barn
Renovating the stable block
Poultry equipment
Reconnecting services, such as electricity 
If we are not successful in reaching our target, all the funds contributed will still go towards these projects and getting them as close to completion as possible.    Risks & Challenges Living in an area with foxes, hawks and lynx, keeping free range chickens can always pose as a risk, luckily we have 2 livestock guardian dogs who keep that risk low. Other factors that can be a challenge are the short summers and long winters we get.

The goats have a totally organic and local diet of hay grown on our own land, free grazing in the forest and supplemented with organic grain, grown in a neighbouring village.

The chickens
We currently have 10 chickens on the farm, all for egg production. This year we are growing our chicken flock to 50 laying hens and 100+ meat birds. They will have full access to the land to scratch up and help rejuvenate the soil, they will also have full access to the forest, and allowed to live as natural of a life as possible. 

The Pigs
The pigs live a happy free range life in the forest, they have a very natural life, how pigs should live, free of confinement. They spend their days foraging, sleeping and playing. They help the forest to stay healthy whilst being happy and healthy themselves. Life is stress free. Happy pigs provide us with good happy meat. We have three breeding sows, and expecting our first litter of piglets very soon. 

All of our animals have a happy life, with no soy, no GMOs and antibiotic free.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

in 2007, and has swept across Asia and Europe. We’re just starting to see them
here in the United States. If you want a small taste of what to expect, check
out our video for a short demonstration. Escape rooms are great for adults and
teens, couples, families, corporate team building and more. It’s an experience
like no other, and the best hour you’ll spend!</span><br/></p>
<p><b>Why me?</b></p>
<p> I first discovered escape rooms about a year
ago, and have done a number of them in the area. I also worked at an escape
room where I learned the secrets behind the business. Combine that with the 7
years experience in management and I have the tools needed to create a successful
business and improve on what exists. At my current job I’ve been in charge of
marketing, social media, customer service, budgeting, payroll, and more. Everything
needed to run a business. With my lifelong love of gaming and creative edge, I
can design and implement the puzzles and games in the rooms themselves. </p>

<p>In addition to
supporting a new local small business, you’ll get an entry to the most fun
event you’ve experienced! </p>
<p>For every $20 you
donate you’ll get one entry to our escape rooms when they open. (Normally we’ll
be charging $28.50) </p>
<p>$120 will get you a
full room to yourself for six people. </p>
<p>$250 will get you two
full rooms of six people, plus your name on our “wall of founders” on our
webpage and at CluedIn. </p>
<p>$500 gets you four
full rooms of six people plus we’ll integrate a picture of you or your name
into one of the puzzles in our rooms. </p>
<p>Want to invest more?
For people interested in investing $1000 or more send me a message and I’ll go
over how you can see a return on your investment from 5%-9% of your initial
investment within a year. Plus you’ll receive more benefits as a premier
backer. </p>
<p><b>What makes us
different from other escape rooms?</b></p>
<p>We’ll be opening with
two rooms (trust me, once you do it once you’ll want to do it again!). We’ll be
adding on a third room after 4 months, and a fourth room after 8 months. <br/>
We’ll feature three types of rooms.<br/>
Story rooms- Where the puzzles tell a narrative<br/>
Theme rooms- Where the puzzles all relate to a fun theme <br/>
Challenge rooms- The puzzles will be random or skill based, and players compete
on a leader board to win prizes every 4 months. <br/>
Our rooms will feature fun themes, nothing scary (except maybe around
Halloween), and will be challenging, but never impossible to complete. </p>

</div><p>Hi All,</p><p><br/>I was recently accepted into the IDEX Fellowship program and will be moving to India for six months! If you’re interested in learning more about the work I’ll be doing *and potentially supporting my efforts* please read on!</p><p></p><p><strong>ABOUT THE FELLOWSHIP:</strong></p><p>The IDEX fellowship is a 6-month program that offers professional, cultural and social immersion for talented individuals interested in launching careers in the social enterprise sector.</p><p>IDEX places fellows, like me, alongside local entrepreneurs in homegrown enterprises. Currently IDEX operates in Bangalore, Mumbai, and Hyderabad, India. The main benefits of IDEX are two fold.

<p>1. Introduction </p>
<p>Behold the wonders of a not so distant future. Take a slow deep breath and close your eyes. Imagine our future. Behold all the exciting new opportunities available to you and your family. Look at how far you have come, look at how far we have come as a species. Man, isn’t it funny how your kids look just as you did when you were younger. Marvel at you and your family enjoying a great day out doors, drinking fresh clean water, breathing fresh clean air. We did it! Humanity has finally wakened up and recognized that with efficiency and creativity, we can easily solve the prehistoric energy problems of previous generations. Wait! What’s that? On the surface of that structure; are you kidding me? Can you see it?I know, I know, I can’t believe it either but yes it’s here. Yes, dare I say it????</p>
<p>RAIN POWER IS HERE!</p>
<p>Imagine if every rain shower could generate a useable about of green energy. Imagine if humanity could start using just one of the many unlimited natural god given resources in our great planet to generate a useable amount of power. WE CAN NOW!</p>
<p>I CHALLENGE all of you with the capacity, to imagine a future with unlimited clean green energy derived from every natural accruing rain shower!!!</p>
<p>Would that help our global energy needs???</p>
<p>2. What kind of Rain Power research will this campaign fund?</p>
<p>WEDO TECHNOLOGY is seeking funding for rain power (kinetic) energy research. We believe we can have a fully operational system within the next 18-36 months. Much of the needed technologies for this process already exist, nevertheless no visionary has derived a system to start this process. Humanity’s never ending quest for unlimited sustainable energy solutions leads our spices in many exciting new directions. This seemingly never ending quest for energy has overtaken our hunger for knowledge, innovation, &amp; unity. We’ve lost our imagination and will to take our species &amp; planet in exciting new directions. Many creative minds settle for the visions of pervious innovators instead of craving their own paths. We want to change this narrative.</p>
<p>For years I've independently research energy derived from rain power. I believe the kinetic energy from rain drops along with the current produced from the liquid could create productive amounts of green natural energy. Living in Florida has allowed me to test my theory preliminary but now is the time for this groundbreaking great green solution to take it to the next level. I want to start from starch. Although I know I have great ideas and systems already, with the right funding and a fresh start I believe I can create several productive prototypes.</p>
<p>Each rain drop creates energy as it ascends from the sky. In every rain storm billions if not trillions of energy droplets fall to the ground. Each time one of these energy droplets hit the surface it creates measurable kinetic energy from the impact. Imagine when we designed surfaces that generated energy based off kinetic energy derived from rain drops. These system would benefit some areas more than most, but these systems will add to our planets overall energy portfolio and help to reduce the need for unsustainable energy solutions. We need more creative plans for action if were truly seeking results.</p>

<p>There are five forms of kinetic energy- All of our current energy is derived from these 5 sources.</p>

<p>2.Heat</p>
<p>3.Sound</p>

<p>Note we currently generate useable power from all the above sources accept sound. Rain power is correlated with motion. The energy I intend to harness is kinetic Rain motion energy.</p>
<p>Has Kinetic Energy ever been used to generate useful electrical power?</p>
<p>Yes! </p>
<p>In the London Olympics a walk way was designed to generate kinetic (motion) electrical power from the footsteps of stadium travelers; to power cellphone power stations and street light. These kind of creative solutions are what’s need to fully diversify our energy portfolio.</p>
<p>If usable energy could be derived from footsteps in the London Olympics, then why wouldn't rain energy provide enough useful kinetic (motion) energy?</p>
<p>WE BELIEVE IT WILL!</p>
<p>4. WEDO TECHNOLOGY ENERGY VISION FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS:</p>
<p>The key to Energy salvation is not finding some super natural energy supply source, it is energy storage systems. Energy storage is the key to true key to humanity's energy prosperity. Many great minds across the globe already fully understand the need for sufficient energy storage methods. Nevertheless most are misguided in their quest to find a central energy storage system. They should instead focus on smaller more efficient energy storage devices which are more cost effective and require less manufacturing, and less energy to produce. Many central energy storage systems currently exist, but these system are all very costly and years away from making a real difference.</p>
<p><br/> I believe all devices should be designed to work off the power grid for at least 72hrs minimum. All products should be designed with 2 internal energy storage systems, with one only operating while the other is charging, equally all products should not be connected to the power grid unless they are charging; phantom energy usage accounts for a majority of global energy waste, controlling it is the key to energy salvation. These few changes alone would produce more energy than 1000 nuclear power plants. Humanity waste more energy than we use, if we started working on more ways of reducing our wasted energy all new methods of energy production will be that much better.</p>
<p>A majority of our products are designed based on a 200yr old energy grid. How can we solve our energy need if were still perfecting industrial age technologies. It amazes me that the brilliant minds of today are still attempting to solve the same problems of previous generations. Too many choose to follow the lead of pervious innovators instead of finding their own paths to innovation. More creative minds need to start craving their own path. The time has come from more creativity, productivity and innovation.</p>
<p>The key to energy salvation is not solely finding new unlimited natural source of energy but equally using the energy supply we currently have more efficiently. We must not only search for new natural abundant energy sources but additionally finding ways of containing our currently wasted energy. I believe many of efforts globally are overly misguided in their quest for energy dominance. The ultimate quest should be for energy efficiency. The most efficient nation will find much more prosperity than Most. Focusing on energy storage system is the true key to energy dominance. Once wasted energy is efficiently contained then true quest for energy dominance can begin.</p>
<p>5. Conclusion</p>
<p>Lost in the pages of history is opportunity-</p>
<p>Generation after generation had the opportunity to work together-</p>
<p>And did not-</p>
<p>Are we to follow their lead or do we crave our own paths?</p>
<p>Only time will tell!!</p>
<p>Opportunities fall from the sky like golden rain drops. Many see the storm but don’t take advantage! What will you do?</p>
<p>Greed blinds many from seeing opportunity. Unlimited power means unlimited economic potential, unlimited prosperity and ultimately unlimited opportunities for all who seek. I believe we have an unbelievable opportunity to forever change our world. We could start creating surfaces which added to our planets energy diversification providing future sustainability an additional power options for future generations. Rain power is not cold fusion but it is another creative green energy method. WEDO TECHNOLOGY wants to bring rain power to life and with your help we will. Now is our time. This is our generation.</p>
<p>WEDO TECNOLOGY is sparking a CLEAN ENERGY RENAISSANCE. Now is our time. Together we must start leading and bringing forth solutions which can clean our environment and help our citizens.</p>

<p>6. UPDATE 1:</p>
<p>UNLIMITED NATURAL SUSTAINABLE<br/>ELECTRICAL ENERGY THROUGH MOTION <br/>THEORY: BY JOHN TAYLOR-WEDO TECHNOLOGY 12/27/15</p>
<p>I believe we may be closer to unlimited natural energy than we think. Future generations will need many different energy solutions to fuel growing populations. Humanity must start deriving more sustainable energy solutions to advance our planet and species.</p>
<p>I believe one of the many solutions will be to derive motion energy from natural occurring events in nature (such as: River current, Rain showers, lighting, Waterfalls, hurricanes, tidal energy, oceans energy, sandstorms, mudslides, earthquakes and more). I believe the key to unlimited sustainable energy will be derived form a combination of all these natural occurring events.<br/></p>
<p>Unlimited energy is not the solution to humanity energy problems but it is a solution to how we derive unlimited electrical power energy. Again as I've stated in other opinions, the key to humanity’s energy problem is not unlimited energy systems; it’s a combination of energy storage systems (BATTERIES or similar devices) as well as, proper energy management (reducing and containing wasted energy). Nevertheless if humanity starts focusing on a combination these natural occurring sustainable solutions, we can achieve our goal of unlimited sustainable energy for future generations.</p>
<p>Note: In no way am I discounting solar or wind energy. Solar &amp; Wind both are major keys to humanity progressions, because they both exist throughout space. Finding more effective and efficient solar &amp; wind options will be critical for intergalactic space travel. (I would also like to note that I have an unbelievable addition to solar technology that will change the efficiency of solar technology for future generations (patent pending))</p>
<p>Others may have similar theories but if they exist I have not seen nor read them. My theory is based off my opinion. No one has all the answers but all great minds will have their own opinions on futuristic ideas and innovations. I'm just making sure my theories are public.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I truly see the challenge many great minds had when trying to relay futuristic visions and new concepts to the general public. Most simple minds lack the capacity in understanding non existing innovations and concepts. I’ve come to recognize that it’s extremely hard for many to grasp such complex visions of our future. Too many attempted to correlate my projects with non-similar existing creations, not fully seeing the many differences my systems present. Sometimes it’s hard to relay a vision to those without the capacity to understand the concepts. Nevertheless, like many driven minds before me, I push forward. <br/> I will not let anyone stop me from showing the world, that there are creative solutions which can help clean our planet and bring more opportunities &amp; prosperity to all of our peoples. WEDO Technology is here to change the world and with your support we know we will.</p>

The key to energy salvation is not solely finding new unlimited natural source of energy but equally using the energy supply we currently have more efficiently. We must not only search for new natural abundant energy sources but additionally finding ways of containing our currently wasted energy. I believe many of efforts globally are overly misguided in their quest for energy dominance. The ultimate quest should be for energy efficiency. The most efficient nation will find much more prosperity than Most. Focusing on energy storage system is the true key to energy dominance. Once wasted energy is efficiently contained then true quest for energy dominance can begin.
5. Conclusion
Lost in the pages of history is opportunity-
Generation after generation had the opportunity to work together-
And did not-
Are we to follow their lead or do we crave our own paths?
Only time will tell!!
Opportunities fall from the sky like golden rain drops. Many see the storm but don’t take advantage! What will you do?
Greed blinds many from seeing opportunity. Unlimited power means unlimited economic potential, unlimited prosperity and ultimately unlimited opportunities for all who seek. I believe we have an unbelievable opportunity to forever change our world. We could start creating surfaces which added to our planets energy diversification providing future sustainability an additional power options for future generations. Rain power is not cold fusion but it is another creative green energy method. WEDO TECHNOLOGY wants to bring rain power to life and with your help we will. Now is our time. This is our generation.
WEDO TECNOLOGY is sparking a CLEAN ENERGY RENAISSANCE. Now is our time. Together we must start leading and bringing forth solutions which can clean our environment and help our citizens.
 
6. UPDATE 1:
UNLIMITED NATURAL SUSTAINABLEELECTRICAL ENERGY THROUGH MOTION THEORY: BY JOHN TAYLOR-WEDO TECHNOLOGY 12/27/15
I believe we may be closer to unlimited natural energy than we think. Future generations will need many different energy solutions to fuel growing populations. Humanity must start deriving more sustainable energy solutions to advance our planet and species.
I believe one of the many solutions will be to derive motion energy from natural occurring events in nature (such as: River current, Rain showers, lighting, Waterfalls, hurricanes, tidal energy, oceans energy, sandstorms, mudslides, earthquakes and more). I believe the key to unlimited sustainable energy will be derived form a combination of all these natural occurring events.
Unlimited energy is not the solution to humanity energy problems but it is a solution to how we derive unlimited electrical power energy. Again as I've stated in other opinions, the key to humanity’s energy problem is not unlimited energy systems; it’s a combination of energy storage systems (BATTERIES or similar devices) as well as, proper energy management (reducing and containing wasted energy). Nevertheless if humanity starts focusing on a combination these natural occurring sustainable solutions, we can achieve our goal of unlimited sustainable energy for future generations.
Note: In no way am I discounting solar or wind energy. Solar & Wind both are major keys to humanity progressions, because they both exist throughout space. Finding more effective and efficient solar & wind options will be critical for intergalactic space travel. (I would also like to note that I have an unbelievable addition to solar technology that will change the efficiency of solar technology for future generations (patent pending))
Others may have similar theories but if they exist I have not seen nor read them. My theory is based off my opinion. No one has all the answers but all great minds will have their own opinions on futuristic ideas and innovations. I'm just making sure my theories are public.
John Taylor
WEDO TECHNOLOGY
Risks & Challenges
I truly see the challenge many great minds had when trying to relay futuristic visions and new concepts to the general public. Most simple minds lack the capacity in understanding non existing innovations and concepts. I’ve come to recognize that it’s extremely hard for many to grasp such complex visions of our future. Too many attempted to correlate my projects with non-similar existing creations, not fully seeing the many differences my systems present. Sometimes it’s hard to relay a vision to those without the capacity to understand the concepts. Nevertheless, like many driven minds before me, I push forward.  I will not let anyone stop me from showing the world, that there are creative solutions which can help clean our planet and bring more opportunities & prosperity to all of our peoples. WEDO Technology is here to change the world and with your support we know we will.
Special Note: 
WEDO Technology is launching #innovationBONANZA  & #cleanENERGYrenaissance  campaigns from 12/10-12/31. The goal of these campaigns are to promote the Crowdfunding Community, creativity, unity, innovation,  and clean sustainable solutions for our planet and future generations.

Short Summary TheDecalCollective.com
I am a double engineering major currently at a state university. As a young adult who has worked many jobs in many different industries, I decided to put my skills to the test and create an awesome small business by college students for college students. This is extremely important to me, as I have put a lot of my own time and money into this business to get it off the ground. If this becomes a successful venture, I want to hire other college students and to also begin donating a portion of the profit to charity. If I do not get help from contributors, I stand to have a very slow increase in growth which might take me a while, as all my funds are wrapped into this business. I am passionate about this, and am working hours each day to make this a business as sustainable, eco friendly, college budget friendly, and philanthropical as possible.   What We Need & What You Get 
I will need about 500 dollars:
To pay designers for new designs which are custom to college universities in order to cater to school spirit
To use facebook marketing campaigns to acquire more website clicks and page likes
To be able to create an ambassador program to get other college students to sell the decals at their respective campus 
If I do not reach my entire goal, I will try to acquire manufacture more inventory at a lower price in order to make the product more affordable.


    Risks & Challenges There are going to be a few challenges: to get prices down in order to make retail prices much more affordable for customers. People want all of the designs and decals in the pipeline all at the same time, which requires too much capital for me to perform. I have been the director of retail operations, with 8 employees receiving record high profits in one season of 65,000$ due to working 80 hours each week, and with the money given, I can promise just that.

<p>The table is set and it's time to eat...dig in.  All of a sudden, my
youngest daughter starts vomiting violently.  Only two-years-old, she
desperately wants to eat, even after getting sick.  But she can't.  She
cries, my wife cries, and I have tears welling up...unaware of what to do, to
help my baby girl.  That was the start of learning Alyssa had Celiac
disease.  And through testing, we found out our oldest, Ava, also has
celiac disease and is a-symptomatic...quietly destroying her insides.  So
we started our gluten-free diet, like so many others have to do. Which in turn
ended our carefree lifestyle of eating on the go.</p>
<p>I'm Mike Orlando.  My wife, Brenda and I have been living
that lifestyle for five years.  We are working parents that care deeply
for their children and struggle to find options in restaurants...at least,
those that are definitely clear of contaminants. It is always a risk for us. Sometimes you just want to go out to eat or grab a quick bite on the go.</p>
<p>We don't want to be sad, angry, or depressed. We just want to take
action. Gud and Free is our action. Gud n Free will be the first
allergy-free restaurant in the region...we have found nothing like this within 250
miles of us. The facility will be free of wheat, gluten, fish and nuts. With our cooking style we can also avoid dairy and soy as well. </p><p>We will be serving burgers, breaded chicken sandwiches and subs on good bread or with many other features. We have worked to find good food, which took a lot of research as well as trial and error.  But it's good. You might not even know the difference, or perhaps like it better.</p>
<p>By helping us, you will give people the opportunity to
eat the same foods that many take for granted...to feel ""included"" instead of

<p>Let's talk about myself. I'm Chris van Steenbergen a young entrepreneur (now 35) started way-back in 1996 to connected people to the Internet. In that time it was only possible to get 'online' when you got a dial-up modem with an amazing speed of 1200 bps (1 Mbps = 1000000 bps). In that time I was involved in setting up a dial-in Internet Provider in the Netherlands to give these modems access to the Internet. Actually you couldn't call it internet since it was a system of bulletin boards systems(BBS). The real Internet was with Netscape Navigator which could download HTML pages. In 2004 I started a Wireless Internet Service Provider (when WiFi was called 802.11) with more than 5000 connections and covered several hospitals, elderly care centers and cities like Rotterdam (mobile Wimax) and Amsterdam (iBurst). In 2007 I takeover the nationwide paging operator Callmax and in 2013 the spin-off The Telecom Company was born.

Looking back to nowadays, I'm still in the telecom business and i'm still doing the same from what I was starting with: Connecting devices instead of people on the Internet. 



What We Need
 First of all, we need your support, without an army we cannot conquer the world. I am a very driven entrepreneur with a lot of connections (15.000+ on LinkedIn) so that is a good start. But on a global scale that's nothing. 
So what is the plan.... simple, just get IoT gateways like (below) up-and-running in the whole world and get these devices connected.

How can I support
You can support us in 2 ways:
As a network builder. We will organize an IoT-Kit to get you up-and-running to build your own Internet of Things network in your neighbourhood, including the full support of our team. We take care of the collected data from devices which will be handled and saved on our 'open' cloud-database. Your gateway will be one of the gateways which will be installed worldwide.
As an investor. We are welcoming you to get you on board of our telecom venture. Back us in the worldwide network rollout and support our company to become a global telecommunication operator for the Internet-of-Things. 
With both ways, with the revenue we realise, we will help other entrepreneurs in building wonderful things. One of the things we currently working on is a bracelet to track-and-trace elderly, children or even your car.
If don't worry if you cannot make a choice. Your donation will help us a little bit closer to reach our goals.
If we are not succeeded in our campaign, then we will still delivering the gateways and give it another try when the market is ready for us.



The Specs



Comparing to other competitors in the market:- More than 30% cheaper than other IoT gateways in the market.
- Provide coverage up to 22 kilometers with 5 dBi external antenna.- The gateway is modular build and can be customized.- Runs in standalone or mesh mode to cover entire cities.- One gateway is able to serve up to 10.000 IoT devices.
The Impact 
As Internet connectivity gets embedded into everything from baby monitors to industrial sensors, investors, entrepreneurs and engineers are rushing to cash in. According to Gartner, Internet of Things (IoT) vendors will earn more than $309 billion by 2020. However, most of those earnings will come from services.
The Impact is tremendous, even if we are getting only 1% of the 30 billion devices connected by 2020 we are doing great!
The IoT (Internet of Things) technology is a huge step forward in the management of devices around us. In 2020, at least 212 billion devices are in the market waiting to get connected to the Internet. In this growing market we need a global organisation, to providing the infrastructure to the people devices. Let's make this devices communicate on our gateways. The time is now to get in this huge growth market. 

Risks & Challenges
 Are there risks? Ofcourse there are risks, one of the risk is that we don't have enough support and we cannot overwhelming the world with blinking IoT gateways. In that case we will be very upset :-(

<p>Growing up, my Great Aunt Mable was my encouragement.  She always told me I could do anything.  To this day, I can see her reassuring smile saying go for it.</p>
<p>Not everyone has my Aunt Mable cheering them on from the sidelines.  Not everyone has a support system; not one person saying you can do it.  The world is great at telling us our dreams are destined to fail, so why bother trying.  These are the people I want to reach.  These are the individuals I created the #whathaveyouinspired movement to help.</p>
<p>I made my dream a reality almost 2 years ago, after being diagnosed with cancer.  I learned the hard way we may not always have tomorrow.  We need to make our dreams happen today.  I created my company, called it Love 2 Inspire and opened Inspired Boutique; where I sell products made with reclaimed and upcycled materials crafted from my hands.  Up to this point, I've only sold what I've made.</p>
<p>I've been blessed to have my business grow steadily, allowing me to move into a prime location.  <b>This move will finally allow me to begin fulfilling the true vision for Love 2 Inspire......making dreams a reality for others.</b></p>
<p>Our communities are full of talented men and women who need a little help growing their dream seed.  This new location will allow me the ability to be their encouragement and support.  All the motivation I need is the reward of inspiring someone else to live their dream; starting within my own community.</p>
<p>By providing a safe and creative environment for local craftsmen/women, amazing custom displays, wonderful signage and traffic of over 6 million people annually, I'm removing huge roadblocks and hurdles to making their crafts a viable and successful business.  This will also remove a major financial burden for these talented individuals.</p>
<p>Along with helping local craftsmen/women, I want to lift up those who feel they no longer have a dream seed.  Those who've had their seed trampled or crushed. Those who just need to know someone still care.  I still care!</p>
<p>I could move into my new space, renovate, build, and sell just my kreations single handedly, but who'll benefit?  Just me, myself, and I.   That's not acceptable to me. <b> I want men and women from my local rescue mission and community to benefit. </b> I want to hire those who need a hand-up, not a handout.  If you walk through your local mission, I know you'll find skilled and talented workers;  relying on their services due to circumstances instead of choices.</p>
<p>The reason I named my company Love 2 Inspire was to INSPIRE! The same reason I started the #whathaveyouinspired movement.  To inspire change with love to create hope and opportunity.  I want everyone to know there's hope in ALL circumstances and share the blessings God has graced upon me.</p>
<p><b>I'd love for you to join the #whathaveyouinspired movement!  Will you help create hope and be the change?  Will you take a stand, instead of watching life happen from the sidelines?</b></p>

</div><div> <p>Here's how the #whathaveyouinspired movement needs breakdown:</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444168340/vhjjnaikadft032s4mxd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div><br/></div>If we can't raise enough money, then I'll have to limit the number of craftspeople I bring into the boutique and the number of workers I hire.  I want to help as many people as possible.  If we don't raise enough funds, I will be forced to divide monies raised at the same percentage points as the full amount.  It won't have the same impact to the community or individuals in need.  I sincerely hope you'll help me avoid making those difficult cuts.  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In exchange for your help, you can choose the perk package that best suits your budget.  (see perk information at the bottom of page)</span>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>You may be wondering why should you join the #whathaveyouinspired movement and I'm glad you asked!  </p>
<p>First, think back to a time in your life when the odds were stacked against you.  How difficult was that time period?  If one person, one stranger would've been in your corner, how would it have changed your perspective?  <b>All it takes is one person to start a small ripple in the water.  Just think of the wave we could create if our individual waves were joined together.  We could change the world.</b></p>
<p>Second, that's exactly what my long term goal is....to change the world.  I may be starting in my own community, but I have my sites set on yours, and yours, and yours.  Eventually, I'd love to have my brick &amp; mortar (and online) boutique filled with wares from around the world.  All handcrafted by individuals struggling to grow their dream seed.  Then I can begin to hire more individuals that need work. Imagine if the movement inspires other businesses and individuals to do the same in their communities!</p>
<p>I have to start somewhere, at the beginning and I'd feel blessed to have you join my movement.  A movement to make dreams reality.  To show dreams are possible and worth nurturing.  That each and every person has a dream they can achieve.  It may take a village to raise a child, but it takes that same village to raise a dream, a person from the ashes.  </p>
<p>Who knows where your contribution can take our movement.  Today it might be creating a job painting a display, for a single father trying to keep his family together at the Rescue Mission.  Tomorrow it might be the same single father selling his handcrafted products to a world-wide customer base; allowing him to buy a home, send his kids to college, and inspire them to dream.  One of those children may discover the cure for cancer.  </p>
<p><b>I do know it can NOT happen if we don't try.  If we don't encourage.  If we don't support.  Will you start a little ripple with me?  </b></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenge</h3> <p>I've been blessed and my locally owned small business has grown, but I'm still small.  Being a small business myself, it's beyond my capabilities to handle this entire movement myself.  I need a little help from you to let it see the light of day.</p>
<p>I'm providing a prime location that has over 6 million visitors annually.  I can hardly believe it's possible after two years, let alone if I was just starting out on the unknown world of being self-employed.  I wouldn't have made it this far if a friend hadn't offered his unused office space at a price I could afford.  He asked for far less than it was worth, but I couldn't have afforded a penny more.  This allowed me the opportunity to see if my dream could blossom.  I want to do the same for others.   <b>I want to pay it forward. </b></p>
<p>Along with a physical location, I'm providing the insurance, an online boutique, sales staff, and advertising for each and every crafts-person I bring on board.  This is all I can afford to do alone.  I wish I had unlimited resources, but that isn't the case.  I need your help to make this movement possible.</p>
<p>The proper professional displays to suit each product, custom business signs, and labor to make it all happen will take a huge financial burden off each craftsman/woman; along with burdens of the next paycheck or meal for some at the Rescue mission.  The effects will be felt throughout the area and the money they earn will be spent back into the community.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>I know some of you are in the situations I described in the beginning.  You're in need of encouragement and support.  The great news is you can still make a huge difference by sharing our campaign with everyone you know.  As a matter of fact, we're offering a special prize to one lucky person.  Once we reach our goal and our campaign has ended, the person who shared our campaign to the largest number of people who became donors will win a special prize.  The winner and only the winner will walk away with an embroidered ski jacket bearing our movement title.  You can proudly show off the impact you made toward inspiring change with love to create hope.  This prize is worth over $400.  Throughout the campaign, I'll post sneak peeks of the prize.</p>

</div></div>","The #whathaveyouinspired Movement Each of us has a dream, a tiny little seed of hope, & the desire to live it.  Our little seed needs encouragement & support to make it blossom.
Growing up, my Great Aunt Mable was my encouragement.  She always told me I could do anything.  To this day, I can see her reassuring smile saying go for it.
Not everyone has my Aunt Mable cheering them on from the sidelines.  Not everyone has a support system; not one person saying you can do it.  The world is great at telling us our dreams are destined to fail, so why bother trying.  These are the people I want to reach.  These are the individuals I created the #whathaveyouinspired movement to help.
I made my dream a reality almost 2 years ago, after being diagnosed with cancer.  I learned the hard way we may not always have tomorrow.  We need to make our dreams happen today.  I created my company, called it Love 2 Inspire and opened Inspired Boutique; where I sell products made with reclaimed and upcycled materials crafted from my hands.  Up to this point, I've only sold what I've made.
I've been blessed to have my business grow steadily, allowing me to move into a prime location.  This move will finally allow me to begin fulfilling the true vision for Love 2 Inspire......making dreams a reality for others.
Our communities are full of talented men and women who need a little help growing their dream seed.  This new location will allow me the ability to be their encouragement and support.  All the motivation I need is the reward of inspiring someone else to live their dream; starting within my own community.
By providing a safe and creative environment for local craftsmen/women, amazing custom displays, wonderful signage and traffic of over 6 million people annually, I'm removing huge roadblocks and hurdles to making their crafts a viable and successful business.  This will also remove a major financial burden for these talented individuals.
Along with helping local craftsmen/women, I want to lift up those who feel they no longer have a dream seed.  Those who've had their seed trampled or crushed. Those who just need to know someone still care.  I still care!
I could move into my new space, renovate, build, and sell just my kreations single handedly, but who'll benefit?  Just me, myself, and I.   That's not acceptable to me.  I want men and women from my local rescue mission and community to benefit.  I want to hire those who need a hand-up, not a handout.  If you walk through your local mission, I know you'll find skilled and talented workers;  relying on their services due to circumstances instead of choices.
The reason I named my company Love 2 Inspire was to INSPIRE! The same reason I started the #whathaveyouinspired movement.  To inspire change with love to create hope and opportunity.  I want everyone to know there's hope in ALL circumstances and share the blessings God has graced upon me.
I'd love for you to join the #whathaveyouinspired movement!  Will you help create hope and be the change?  Will you take a stand, instead of watching life happen from the sidelines?
#whathaveyouinspired      #inspirechangeandhope
How You can Inspire Change
 Here's how the #whathaveyouinspired movement needs breakdown:


If we can't raise enough money, then I'll have to limit the number of craftspeople I bring into the boutique and the number of workers I hire.  I want to help as many people as possible.  If we don't raise enough funds, I will be forced to divide monies raised at the same percentage points as the full amount.  It won't have the same impact to the community or individuals in need.  I sincerely hope you'll help me avoid making those difficult cuts.  In exchange for your help, you can choose the perk package that best suits your budget.  (see perk information at the bottom of page)
  The Impact You may be wondering why should you join the #whathaveyouinspired movement and I'm glad you asked!  
First, think back to a time in your life when the odds were stacked against you.  How difficult was that time period?  If one person, one stranger would've been in your corner, how would it have changed your perspective?  All it takes is one person to start a small ripple in the water.  Just think of the wave we could create if our individual waves were joined together.  We could change the world.
Second, that's exactly what my long term goal is....to change the world.  I may be starting in my own community, but I have my sites set on yours, and yours, and yours.  Eventually, I'd love to have my brick & mortar (and online) boutique filled with wares from around the world.  All handcrafted by individuals struggling to grow their dream seed.  Then I can begin to hire more individuals that need work. Imagine if the movement inspires other businesses and individuals to do the same in their communities!
I have to start somewhere, at the beginning and I'd feel blessed to have you join my movement.  A movement to make dreams reality.  To show dreams are possible and worth nurturing.  That each and every person has a dream they can achieve.  It may take a village to raise a child, but it takes that same village to raise a dream, a person from the ashes.  
Who knows where your contribution can take our movement.  Today it might be creating a job painting a display, for a single father trying to keep his family together at the Rescue Mission.  Tomorrow it might be the same single father selling his handcrafted products to a world-wide customer base; allowing him to buy a home, send his kids to college, and inspire them to dream.  One of those children may discover the cure for cancer.  
I do know it can NOT happen if we don't try.  If we don't encourage.  If we don't support.  Will you start a little ripple with me?  
    Risks & Challenge I've been blessed and my locally owned small business has grown, but I'm still small.  Being a small business myself, it's beyond my capabilities to handle this entire movement myself.  I need a little help from you to let it see the light of day.
I'm providing a prime location that has over 6 million visitors annually.  I can hardly believe it's possible after two years, let alone if I was just starting out on the unknown world of being self-employed.  I wouldn't have made it this far if a friend hadn't offered his unused office space at a price I could afford.  He asked for far less than it was worth, but I couldn't have afforded a penny more.  This allowed me the opportunity to see if my dream could blossom.  I want to do the same for others.   I want to pay it forward. 
Along with a physical location, I'm providing the insurance, an online boutique, sales staff, and advertising for each and every crafts-person I bring on board.  This is all I can afford to do alone.  I wish I had unlimited resources, but that isn't the case.  I need your help to make this movement possible.
The proper professional displays to suit each product, custom business signs, and labor to make it all happen will take a huge financial burden off each craftsman/woman; along with burdens of the next paycheck or meal for some at the Rescue mission.  The effects will be felt throughout the area and the money they earn will be spent back into the community.
    Other Ways You Can Help I know some of you are in the situations I described in the beginning.  You're in need of encouragement and support.  The great news is you can still make a huge difference by sharing our campaign with everyone you know.  As a matter of fact, we're offering a special prize to one lucky person.  Once we reach our goal and our campaign has ended, the person who shared our campaign to the largest number of people who became donors will win a special prize.  The winner and only the winner will walk away with an embroidered ski jacket bearing our movement title.  You can proudly show off the impact you made toward inspiring change with love to create hope.  This prize is worth over $400.  Throughout the campaign, I'll post sneak peeks of the prize.

To have the system fully operational we need to make design and configure the service to 100 % so we need a trained and qualified person to perform this work .</p>
<p>Also to offer the service you deserve we need to provide adequate equipment and a quality environment so you feel you are in front of us, that´s why we need web cameras and microphones to enhance our equipment (which are quit frankly somewhat old ) .</p>

<p></p><p></p><p>Hangers are one of the vastly used 
day-to-day product in almost every households and clothing outlets.
					However, with the exponentially growing rapid schedule, handling 
the washed and ironed apparels are a challenge. Carefully glancing 
through the existing hangers and doing a quick market survey gave us a 
clear picture of as to what people are looking for- in a hanger. 
Firstly, a hanger should be an efficient user-friendly product, which 
can easily slide through the apparels of any shape and size. Secondly, 
sliding the cloth into the hanger should not take a longer time. With a 
product like GreenHang, the clothes can be snuggled at least five time 
faster than the existing product. Finally, considering the fact that the
 “eco-friendly” products are the topic of interest, GreenHang will be an
 eco-friendly hanger composed of a cost-effective biodegradable 
material.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><h2>WHO NEEDS GreenHang</h2>
<ul>
<li>
							Every members in the household who go through hanging the clothes.</li>
<li>Every clothing outlets that needs to align the disassembled apparels in the clothing racks.
						</li>
</ul><p><b>Market survey</b><br/></p><p>We did a quick market survey in the clothing outlets at North Dakota. The survey consisted of both sales reps and customers who were willing to share their opinions on our new product; the questions for the survey were based on, both, composition of the hanger (biodegradable) and design. Following is the summary of the market survey</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473450287/customers_wr4ots.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473450324/reps_zcrqd5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>
</p><h2>WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT GreenHang</h2>
<p>
</p><p>
GreenHang is composed of biodegradable material (corn ethanol by-product
 distiller's dried grain), which can not only degrade in the environment
 rapidly, but also can serve as a fertilizer at the stage of 
wear-and-tear. In the North American continent distillers’ dried grain 
will be used as a major component to produce biodegradable hanger; corn 
is one of the main crops in the US. However, the major component can 
vary from sugar beet pulp to banana peels depending on the demands of 
hanger. For example, if we have a demand in producing hangers for the 
individuals in the African continent, we may mainly use banana peels as a
 major source. The by-products listed above have shown considerable 
strength and durability to make biodegradable composites. </p><p>GreenHang
 is quick, user-friendly, and an eco-friendly hanger. This can be used 
to slide through the apparels of any size and shape (expandable) within 
few seconds. GreenHang is made to meet the need of a large number of 
people both at households and clothing outlets in a cost effective and a
 user-friendly manner

Hangers are one of the vastly used 
day-to-day product in almost every households and clothing outlets.
					However, with the exponentially growing rapid schedule, handling 
the washed and ironed apparels are a challenge. Carefully glancing 
through the existing hangers and doing a quick market survey gave us a 
clear picture of as to what people are looking for- in a hanger. 
Firstly, a hanger should be an efficient user-friendly product, which 
can easily slide through the apparels of any shape and size. Secondly, 
sliding the cloth into the hanger should not take a longer time. With a 
product like GreenHang, the clothes can be snuggled at least five time 
faster than the existing product. Finally, considering the fact that the
 “eco-friendly” products are the topic of interest, GreenHang will be an
 eco-friendly hanger composed of a cost-effective biodegradable 
material.

WHO NEEDS GreenHang


							Every members in the household who go through hanging the clothes.
Every clothing outlets that needs to align the disassembled apparels in the clothing racks.
						
Market surveyWe did a quick market survey in the clothing outlets at North Dakota. The survey consisted of both sales reps and customers who were willing to share their opinions on our new product; the questions for the survey were based on, both, composition of the hanger (biodegradable) and design. Following is the summary of the market survey
WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT GreenHang


GreenHang is composed of biodegradable material (corn ethanol by-product
 distiller's dried grain), which can not only degrade in the environment
 rapidly, but also can serve as a fertilizer at the stage of 
wear-and-tear. In the North American continent distillers’ dried grain 
will be used as a major component to produce biodegradable hanger; corn 
is one of the main crops in the US. However, the major component can 
vary from sugar beet pulp to banana peels depending on the demands of 
hanger. For example, if we have a demand in producing hangers for the 
individuals in the African continent, we may mainly use banana peels as a
 major source. The by-products listed above have shown considerable 
strength and durability to make biodegradable composites. GreenHang
 is quick, user-friendly, and an eco-friendly hanger. This can be used 
to slide through the apparels of any size and shape (expandable) within 
few seconds. GreenHang is made to meet the need of a large number of 
people both at households and clothing outlets in a cost effective and a
 user-friendly manner

<h2>Tamale Madness Fundraising Campaign</h2>
<p>I am an experienced chef of 38 years that decided to start my own business making homemade Tamales. I have combined my experience as a cook in The United States Navy, and the civilian Culinary Arts Industry,combining my culinary education and practical experiences, and produced a high quality marketable sellable product. I am seeking funds to expand my  business and help it grow. I have cultivated my Tamale business and developed a ""cult like following"" of a highly desirable product. I have developed a clientele of returning and new clients with my ability and motivation, of believing in myself and my products.  Now is your chance to help a budding entrepreneur to take her business to the next level and build on her firm foundation of existing success. </p>
<p>My next challenge/hurdle is to retain the proper business licenses and permits in order to produce my products in a licensed food production kitchen. I have already developed and tested an expanded menu of items that I am positive will be highly desirable and palatable.I have made and sold various menu items to new clients that are unable to cook for themselves for a variety of reasons, whether they are to busy (due to work or personal commitments) they are afraid to cook and handle knives, ( veterans with PTSD) or due to hot weather. The positive impact on my community is already being felt,due to high demand of a high quality product thereby making my product an overnight success. I don't cut corners when producing my products, I use organic herbs and spices, and all fresh ingredients and combined with trade secrets/recipes, and my own formulas. The suggested donation is $25 or more but of course whatever you can afford. </p>

Within minutes of placing the Paw-fect Indoor Dog Boots on the paws of a scared dog who had lost his confidence, that dog is once again walking on smooth floors and joining his family instead of laying on the carpet in the pack porch alone, too scared to walk across the linoleum floor in the kitchen. (This was Randy and he is the Collie in our pitch video).</p><p>I have seen the same dramatic improvement in the life of an amputee dog. Roxi (a 12 year old Pomeranian) wouldn’t leave the safety of the floor mats to join the family. Her pet parent placed just one boot on her remaining front paw and within seconds she was walking with the rest of the pack. See her video here: <a href=""https://youtu.be/yqDtSTTZ2PM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://youtu.be/yqDtSTTZ2PM</a></p><p>When I heard these stories from our first few customers for these boots, I knew we had to get them into the hands of as many pet stores and pet parents as possible, as quickly as possible.</p><p>Until now, we have been content to be a regional company selling smaller quantities of superior products to pet stores in our home province of Alberta. We have a <u>fiercely loyal</u> following of people who have purchased our pet gear. Many have contacted us directly when they have moved out of province for replacement items or to outfit their new fur-kids and we happily ship product to them.</p><p>With this invention however, it’s time for us to expand and roll out the Paw-fect Indoor Dog Boots across North America. We have already moved into a bigger factory building and we have hired a new team member but, we want to hire even more people and we are willing to grow as large as we need to in order to help as many dogs as we can.</p><p>With your help, we can achieve this lofty goal.</p><p><strong>Here’s How You Can Help</strong></p><p><strong>Here’s What You Get</strong></p><p>We are offering some of our superb products in exchange for your contribution:</p><ol><li>$55.00 CDN Early Bird Jump Starter Perk: Receive one pair of the Paw-fect Indoor Dog Boots plus 3 bonuses.<ol>

At the moment it takes about four minutes to sew just one boot from start to finish.

However, they are expensive, approximately $25,000 each. Instead of borrowing the money from a bank or leasing the machine, we wanted to appeal directly to you, an everyday investor and potential customer. I prefer to put product into someone’s hands in exchange for their contribution. I like to earn my money the old-fashioned way; by working for it!</p><p><i>But you are asking for $60,000? </i></p><p>Let me tell you what else we wish to do with your investment:</p><ul>
<li>We need to update our website and create a more customer-friendly experience on the web.</li>
<li>We have a marketing firm lined up to help us spread our story in a more effective way.</li>
<li>We want to travel to Pet Industry trade shows so we can exhibit and tell even more people about the Paw-fect Indoor Dog Boots and some of our other unique and exclusive items.</li>
<li>We want to travel to more consumer shows like pet expos to tell more pet parents about our products and how we can help improve the pet guardian experience.</li>
<li>We want to hire even more team members and put more Albertans back to work.</li>
<li>Together we will be helping an amazing charity, the Lions Foundation Dog Guides program.</li>
</ul><p><i>What happens if you raise way more than $60,000?</i></p><p>We will be jumping for joy because you will have confirmed to us how needed this merchandise is. We have a contingency plan for that as well:</p><ul>
<li>We would purchase multiple pattern tackers. (With each additional tacker we will be creating at least one additional job).</li>
<li>We would purchase a die-cutter to mechanically trim multiple boots at a time making us even more efficient. (Again, another new job).</li>
<li>We would be able to buy the fabric in larger quantities, direct from the factory and then be able to offer the Paw-fect Boots in other colors.</li>
<li>We would buy our own loom to weave the nylon webbing we use in-house. This would give us even more freedom to offer different and stylish colors.</li>
<li>We can even look at expanding into Europe and Australia! (Even more jobs).</li>
</ul><p><strong>The Paw-fect Indoor Dog Boots Are Even More Versatile!</strong></p><p>Let me tell you about 2 more uses for these amazing boots:</p><ol>
<li>The unique qualities of the materials we use allow the Paw-fect Indoor Dog Boots to be used as a superior wound boot.</li>
<li>These boots will protect your valuable floors from the damages that dog’s paws can cause. (hardwood, cork, laminate and linoleum will all benefit from the use of these boots).</li>
</ol><p>Unexpectedly, we had to use these boots as a wound-boot ourselves on our dog Riley. A couple of weeks back, we had returned from a walk and Riley was chewing and licking his foot crazily. We went over and pulled the fur back from his toes to take a closer look. Sure enough he had a split between the two middle toes. He had a small mat near the one toe, so we trimmed it up and removed it. I then rinsed Riley’s paw under running water to clean the wound. Next, we put some anti-bacterial cream on the wound and while the paw was still wet, we then put a Paw-fect Boot on him.</p><p>Two hours later, I removed the boot to check on his foot. To my amazement, Riley’s paw was completely dry! The fabric has a slight sponge-like backing on it that helps to wick moisture away. I then put the boot back on Riley and put him in his bed for the night.</p><p>The next morning, I checked on his foot and he already had a thick healthy scab over the wound. A couple more days with the Paw-fect Boot on and the wound was healed.</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>Unlike most of the other fine campaigns on this site, we are already in production with this item. We have done all of the research and development for the materials and production methods. That doesn’t mean we won’t see some challenges. Among them:</p><ul>
<li>A delay in delivery of the pattern tacker could cause a slight delay in delivery of some perks.</li>
<li>It will take about 6 weeks for delivery of the machines. We will place our order before the end of the campaign, once we have confirmed the demand for the boots. This will speed up delivery of the machine(s). If the delay is too long, we can purchase another machine like the one we are currently using and sew them by hand.</li>
<li>An overwhelming response could lead to longer delays. To avoid this, we will breakdown the perks into stages that will allow us to stagger the delivery dates to realistic targets. We will do it that way, so everyone will be informed and we be able to keep your confidence as contributors.</li>
</ul><p>One thing I have learned in business is the importance of communication. We will keep all of our contributors in the loop through frequent updates and emails.</p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>If you are unable to contribute at this time, truly I understand. Many of my customers are struggling in Alberta, so I get it.</p><p>But, we’re not just after your money. You can help in other ways:</p><ul>

We have done all of the research and development for the materials and production methods. That doesn’t mean we won’t see some challenges. Among them:
A delay in delivery of the pattern tacker could cause a slight delay in delivery of some perks.
It will take about 6 weeks for delivery of the machines. We will place our order before the end of the campaign, once we have confirmed the demand for the boots. This will speed up delivery of the machine(s). If the delay is too long, we can purchase another machine like the one we are currently using and sew them by hand.
An overwhelming response could lead to longer delays. To avoid this, we will breakdown the perks into stages that will allow us to stagger the delivery dates to realistic targets. We will do it that way, so everyone will be informed and we be able to keep your confidence as contributors.
One thing I have learned in business is the importance of communication. We will keep all of our contributors in the loop through frequent updates and emails.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are unable to contribute at this time, truly I understand.

<h3>What is Back of the Yards Coffee Co?</h3>
<p>Back of the Yards Coffee Co. is a high quality coffee roaster founded by Mayra Hernandez and Jesse Iñiguez located in the Back of the Yards community that will not only produce great tasting coffee products, but have a direct social and economic impact in the community that we serve. We are establishing relationships with coffee farmers and purchasing directly from them in order to ensure high quality standards and fair wages. By removing middle men we are able to return those savings not only to our customers, but also directly back to the farmers that grow our coffee.</p>
<p>We believe that good quality coffee begins where it is grown, how it is grown and by whom it is grown all the way down to how it is served. We maintain quality by monitoring every step of the process from bean to cup. Which means that not only have we developed standards for our suppliers, but will also train businesses and baristas that serve our products.</p>
<p>We are firm believers that we are products of where we come from. The Back of the Yards Community shaped who we are and provided us the opportunities to grow and become successful. Our goal is to leave our mark and have an impact into the present and future of our community just like it did with us. With every 12 oz bag of coffee that you buy, you can help us accomplish this.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472773959/a7p81yqyhur9egemvgob.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to transform Back of the Yards Coffee Co. from dream to reality, we need your help. For us to begin building our coffee shop, start roasting our fresh coffee beans and begin to have a social and economic impact in Nueva Independencia and Back of the Yards, we need to raise $85,000.</p>
<p>The money raised will help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secure our storefront, do the build out of the space and buy the necessary equipment to make it a functional coffee shop</li>
<li>Purchase and ship green coffee beans from Nueva Independencia farms in Chiapas to Back of the Yards where we will roast them in-house</li>
<li>Buy our roaster and begin testing different roasts to develop our flavor profile</li>
<li>Begin shipping our roasted coffee beans and serving our freshly brewed coffee at our coffeehouse</li>
</ul>
<p>For your generosity, we are offering an array of perks that only our first time contributors will have access to. Some of those perks include discounts to our Coffee Club, exclusive access to our first batches of freshly roasted coffee and limited edition merchandise like mugs, tshirts and decals!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What makes Back of the Yards Coffee Company unique is that beyond our goal of producing high quality coffee, our mission is to have a direct social and economic impact on the communities of Nueva Independencia, Chiapas and Back of the Yards, Chicago. By bridging the two communities, we are able to address their needs. Nueva Independencia produces high quality coffee beans but needs a point of distribution. In Back of the Yards we have the opportunity to create a business that yields high social and economic returns but we need the harvest that Nueva Independencia can provide. </p>
<p>Both Mayra and Jesse are natives of the Back of the Yards neighborhood and have a long track record of service in the community. This project is not only an extension of their commitment to the Back of the Yards but also an opportunity to provide a sustainable business with high economic and social returns to a community that is long overdue for a coffee shop.</p>
<p>That is why they understand the importance of doing this as a community. With your help, Back of the Yards Coffee Co. can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Provide new taxable revenue into the local economy</p></li>
<li><p>Hire locally</p></li>
<li><p>Offer entrepreneurship training and support</p></li>
<li><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>And partner up with current initiatives that are working to yield high social and economic returns</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Currently $47.5 million leave the Back of the Yards community every year in the form of food and beverage sales. With your help, we intend to revert 1%, or $475,000, of that back into the community through sales of our coffee beans within our first 3 years. </p>
<p>Additionally, $1 from every 12 oz coffee bag sold will go towards achieving our goal of making an impact in Back of the Yards. By investing in local initiatives with high social returns, we are able to support programming and scholarships in need of funding. Apart from our passion for roasting high quality coffee, investing back into the community that helped us grow is our main driving force.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Stephanie and Jenny are passionate about creating an amazing art community through our store.  They have found a delightful old building that is currently being gutted and retrofitted in a revitalized area of Ogden.  <br/></p>
<ul> <li>
<span><span><span>Stephanie
 graduated college, with a major in Psychology and a minor in Sociology 
and  Art. With a passion for giving back to the community she worked in 
social work for 17 years. She has now been working the last 7 years with
 the arts in her own business, Our Children's Earth, LLC.  She loves 
expressing her creativity while being eco friendly and staying home with her children.  She is excited to help create this amazing community 
space to support others to accomplish their dreams.</span></span></span><br/>
</li> <li>Jenny is a junior high wood shop teacher who married Rene, a 16th generation silversmith from Colombia. They create hand crafted fine jewelry and sell it at art festivals. Rene also teaches silversmithing and jewelry making classes out of their garage.<br/>
</li> <li>Together, Stephanie and Jenny are thrilled to build a fabulous space where local artists can sell their work, others can learn various art mediums through classes and we can all do amazing things working together.<br/>
</li>
</ul> <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are asking for $10,000.<br/></p> <ul> <li>$5000 will go towards advertising, marketing and community outreach. We want to open with a bang. In order to do that, we want to get the word out through ads on Facebook, in the local newspaper as well as local magazines.  We also will create flyers to distribute around town.  <br/>
</li> <li>$1500  will be used for furniture and fixtures.  We love to reuse, recycle and even upcycle. We have bought most of our display cases and racks at yard sales and from businesses that no longer need theirs.  A portion of this money will also purchase paint for the walls and the cement floor.<br/>
</li> <li>$1000 for our big store front sign as well as a smaller sign for the back door that will open into The Neon Park, which will be finished next year.</li>
<li>$1250 will purchase supplies for our studio space that artists and students can use.</li>
<li>$1250 will purchase furniture, table and supplies for our classroom.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your contributions will be wisely used to create an prodigious art space in our community.  Ogden has long been considered the armpit of Utah with a colorful past. During the last 10 years, there has been a grass roots revitalization and renascence though out our beloved O-Town and especially to the down town area. Ogden is now often ranked by national associations as a favorite ski town, small town and our down town 25th Street is a ranked favorite street in the USA.  <br/></p>
<p>We are renting a part of the Kiesel Building, that has a long, rich history that spans a century. It has been empty for several years. The building has recently been bought and is in the process of being completly remodeled.  The ground level will host several retail stores, including ours. The second story will house a high-tech business, slated to open in less than six weeks.  The  top two floors will become office and business space so that it can maintain its vintage charm. <span> Adjacent to the building, a new park will replace a dilapidated parking lot.  Behind the building, the city is cleaning out the alley way and will create a parking lot to accommodate about 200 cars. </span></p> <ul> <ul>
<li>We have 13 artists who have already signed up with us to sell their 
art through our membership option. They will be paying us a monthly fee 
and working in the store in exchange for selling their art and teaching classes in our space.</li>
<li>We have about 15 other artists that have committed to selling their work on consignment. </li>
<li>This collective gives artists a chance to have a space that before was unaffordable.</li>
<li>All artists who work with us must live or work in Weber County, making our shop truly a local's artist collective.</li>
</ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We realize all ventures require risks. We are working hard to keep our risks to a minimum.    We have met with business leaders and owners, researched other art coops and collectives and met with the Small Business Administration mentors while we created our detailed business plan that is a hybrid between a co-op and a consignment store.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>We see our biggest challenge as getting people to come to our place.  The store is located on a side street between two big shopping and entertainment centers in Ogden, 25th Street and The Junction.  The city is working to build a bridge between these two areas and we are in the middle of that bridge. We see this as a great opportunity to welcome new customers, locals and visitors as well.<br/>
</li></ul> <p></p>

Stephanie
 graduated college, with a major in Psychology and a minor in Sociology 
and  Art. With a passion for giving back to the community she worked in 
social work for 17 years. She has now been working the last 7 years with
 the arts in her own business, Our Children's Earth, LLC.  She loves 
expressing her creativity while being eco friendly and staying home with her children.  She is excited to help create this amazing community 
space to support others to accomplish their dreams.
 Jenny is a junior high wood shop teacher who married Rene, a 16th generation silversmith from Colombia. They create hand crafted fine jewelry and sell it at art festivals. Rene also teaches silversmithing and jewelry making classes out of their garage.
 Together, Stephanie and Jenny are thrilled to build a fabulous space where local artists can sell their work, others can learn various art mediums through classes and we can all do amazing things working together.

    What We Need & What You Get We are asking for $10,000.  $5000 will go towards advertising, marketing and community outreach. We want to open with a bang. In order to do that, we want to get the word out through ads on Facebook, in the local newspaper as well as local magazines.  We also will create flyers to distribute around town.  
 $1500  will be used for furniture and fixtures.  We love to reuse, recycle and even upcycle. We have bought most of our display cases and racks at yard sales and from businesses that no longer need theirs.  A portion of this money will also purchase paint for the walls and the cement floor.
 $1000 for our big store front sign as well as a smaller sign for the back door that will open into The Neon Park, which will be finished next year.
$1250 will purchase supplies for our studio space that artists and students can use.
$1250 will purchase furniture, table and supplies for our classroom.
    The Impact Your contributions will be wisely used to create an prodigious art space in our community.  Ogden has long been considered the armpit of Utah with a colorful past. During the last 10 years, there has been a grass roots revitalization and renascence though out our beloved O-Town and especially to the down town area. Ogden is now often ranked by national associations as a favorite ski town, small town and our down town 25th Street is a ranked favorite street in the USA.  
We are renting a part of the Kiesel Building, that has a long, rich history that spans a century. It has been empty for several years. The building has recently been bought and is in the process of being completly remodeled.  The ground level will host several retail stores, including ours. The second story will house a high-tech business, slated to open in less than six weeks.  The  top two floors will become office and business space so that it can maintain its vintage charm.  Adjacent to the building, a new park will replace a dilapidated parking lot.  Behind the building, the city is cleaning out the alley way and will create a parking lot to accommodate about 200 cars.   
We have 13 artists who have already signed up with us to sell their 
art through our membership option. They will be paying us a monthly fee 
and working in the store in exchange for selling their art and teaching classes in our space.
We have about 15 other artists that have committed to selling their work on consignment. 
This collective gives artists a chance to have a space that before was unaffordable.
All artists who work with us must live or work in Weber County, making our shop truly a local's artist collective.
    Risks & Challenges
We realize all ventures require risks. We are working hard to keep our risks to a minimum.    We have met with business leaders and owners, researched other art coops and collectives and met with the Small Business Administration mentors while we created our detailed business plan that is a hybrid between a co-op and a consignment store.

We see our biggest challenge as getting people to come to our place.  The store is located on a side street between two big shopping and entertainment centers in Ogden, 25th Street and The Junction.  The city is working to build a bridge between these two areas and we are in the middle of that bridge. We see this as a great opportunity to welcome new customers, locals and visitors as well.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The young people we work with typically leave school with little or no prospects of employment or further education. Many have had years of difficulties in their home lives.</p>
<p>Without programmes like Against the Grain they often end up homeless, addicted or at worse with criminal convictions. </p>
<p>Matt, George and John who are our first three trainees, say the project has already helped them gain knowledge of upholstery and finishing techniques, improved their confidence and taught them about working in teams. </p>
<p>The programme has a positive impact on young people as well as a positive impact on our environment. By upcycling furniture we are helping to reduce landfill and restore things that have plenty more life in them yet.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking for support in all shapes and sizes including volunteer tradespeople, donated furniture, money, a van and driver, paint, upholstery fabric and other items that can be upcycled and sold,</p>

With an awesome, super cool, t-shirt you'll be able to show your support for the honeybees and look snazzy at the same time!




Honeybee Photographic PrintsWorking with Denise Yager Photography, we’ve created high quality professional prints of our honeybees in action.  


These prints show the lovable little honeybees visiting flowers pollinating, and working in the hive.  In sets of 3-5 the prints will make awesome wall decor displaying your love for nature and inspiring conversation.




1lb Jar of Quality Local HoneyHoney is often sold in Queenline 1lb Glass Jars.  We’ll work with beekeepers in your local area to provide you with the superior honey only your local beekeepers can provide.  


Local honey is better for you, and supplying a local honey product is better for the environment.  Every jar of honey purchased supports your local beekeeper, and helps the honeybees in your area.  Now that’s a sweet deal!




Hive ShareThis is your chance to own a share of your very own honeybee hive.  We’re offering a ⅙ share, ¼ share, or ½ share of a honeybee hive. 


You’ll get a photograph of your hive, the beekeeper managing the hive, and quarterly updates on the status of the colony from your beekeeper.And the best part; You’ll also get a proportional share of any honey produced by the colony.  A ⅙ share typically equates to 6-7lbs of honey, ¼ share is around 10lbs of honey, and ½ share is around 20lbs.  That’s a lot of honey!
Note: depending on the success of the colony you may received more or less honey.




Bring On The Honeybees!Here’s where you can really make a difference.  Annual honeybee losses are high enough to kill a beekeeping operation.  We need to support those who care for honeybees.  


You can help to contribute a 3lb package of honeybees to a local beekeeper in your area.  Locally sourced honeybees do not need to shipped across the country.  This causes less stress on the honeybees, and reduces the likelihood of the spread of pests and disease.  They also increase the odds that the honeybees will survive in your native regional environment.




Give A Bee A Home - Contribute a new beehiveThe biggest expense a beekeeper faces is the cost of new equipment.  You can help defray this cost by contributing to the cost of a beehive.  This directly helps the beekeepers stay in business, and start the season out right.  


The beekeeper will use the hive to add new colonies to their Apiary (bee yard) or to replace old, worn out equipment.




Build an Apiary & Visit an ApiarySometimes you just go big.  With this perk you’ll build a brand new apiary (bee yard) We’ll work with local beekeepers to source a location for two new hives that you’ve sponsored.  By adding two new colonies to your area you’re ensuring diversity and helping the local pollinators.


We’ll also arrange a visit to an Apiary in your neighborhood.  This will give you time to speak with a beekeeper and see your local honeybees in action.


You should know… we’ve set an aggressive goal to get More Honeybees launched.  Even if we don’t hit our goal, the funds collected will be used for their intended purpose, helping honeybees and their keepers. 
 The ImpactYour food supply is directly dependent on the honeybees.  By participating in our effort you are standing up to say honeybees matter.  Every dollar raised will help the honeybees in your area:
Donating honeybees to a local beekeeper adds pollinators to your local ecology.
Donating honeybees also supports local honeybee breeders which reduces the likelihood of spreading disease and pests by shipping honeybees across the country.
Finally, donating honeybees also helps a beekeeper offset the costs of replacing honeybees lost during the prior season.
Providing beekeepers with new equipment helps to support beekeepers, who are the people that love honeybees most and physically work the hardest to support them.
It’s all good for the industry, for the honeybees, for local pollination, and for your food supply.
If we’re successful, your local area will have more honeybees, better able to survive in your area, with a stronger beekeeper community to help take care of them.  Doing this across the nation will support pollinators and protect your food supply.
 Risks & ChallengesIn any new venture there are always risks and challenges.  The trick is to identify the troublespots and put plans in place to mitigate them.
If a tree falls in the woods and no one hears it…We’re counting on the social power of the internet to get the word out.  That means you.  If we launch this effort, and no one shares, no one knows, our impact will be minimal.  Please share this page, encourage your friends to share, and share it again.  You’re key to our success!
Our intent is to source our honey and honeybees from beekeepers close to you.  This supports your local ecology.  However, if we can’t find someone in your neighborhood we’ll do our best to get as close as possible.
What if we’re wildly successful??Too much too soon can also be a problem, but that’s a problem we’d like to face!  With 25 years of operational experience, we know how to deliver.  We’re confident we can contact enough beekeepers to keep you in honey!

 Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute.  We understand that.  But that doesn't mean they can't help.
Please help get the word out and make some noise about our efforts.  Please share this page, and encourage others to share it as well.
If you have a skill set you think will help, please contact us about volunteering.  We’re always looking for more volunteers to help pick up the cause.
Our honeybees and our food supply is depending on your effort and participation.  Thank you for being part of the team.",12.0,1,"1 Campaign
