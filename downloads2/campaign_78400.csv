<p>A powerful motivator for him to work hard is eligibility for grants, scholarships and bursaries in his 2nd, 3rd and 4th years of university, if his marks are high enough.  But for this first year, he simply needs a great deal of money for his tuition and basic expenses.  </p>
<p><strong>Ogo-Oluwa's goals?</strong></p>
<p>He wants to become one of Nigeria's best classical flutists and have an international performance career.</p>
<p><strong>What He Still Needs </strong></p>
<p>The first campaign raised approximately $7,600 after fees, which will pay off his tuition for the remainder of his first year and does provide some left-over funds for food, and rent, which is now $500 a month. </p>
<p><strong>BUDGET:</strong></p>
<p>$1,000 - towards rent</p>
<p>$3,000 - towards food, bathroom and kitchen supplies for the next 8 months</p>
<p>$1,500 - instrument overhaul and re-padding;  his flute is in dire need of repair</p>
<p>$1,000 - university text books and supplies, including sheet music</p>
<p><strong>PERKS</strong> include, but are not limited to, the satisfaction of becoming an integral part of this young man's future success.  These are not typical 'perks'; they aren't 'physical' - he has no means of rewarding your contribution other than being intensely grateful and also working hard to honour your contribution. </p>

<p><br/><strong>AQUABEAR LEGION CELEBRATES 15 YEARS WITH TWO COMPILATIONS!</strong><br/>Aquabear has been around since 2004, so to celebrate our 15th anniversary we are producing two new compilations! One is on vinyl and features new Ohio music (Volume 7) and one is a curated cassette compilation of classic Ohio music (Mother of Presidents). We want you to help put these awesome collections out there. Please consider pre-ordering and supporting your local Aquabear.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>AQUABEAR LEGION VOLUME 7</strong><br/>Volume 7 in our Ohio compilation series will be pressed to vinyl by Musicol in Columbus and feature music from Actual Form, Ampline, Buffalo Killers, Counterfeit Madison, DANA, Hiram-Maxim, Lung, Smizmar, and Van Dale. This will be a run of 300 records, 50 of which will be some sort of super special vinyl color. Art for the compilation will be by Athens' own Chris Biester.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>MOTHER OF PRESIDENTS </strong><br/>An Aquabear Legion Archival Release. We have decided to curate our first archival compilation and release it on cassette! Aquabear has only been in the Ohio music game since 2004, while many fine folks have been at this for a long time. This tape will feature songs from legendary Ohio acts from all around the state, covering years from 1974 to 2004. Music from: 84 Nash, Appalachian Death Ride, Geraldine, Grafton, Great Plains, Jenny Mae, Log, Mike Elliott, Mirrors, Orchestraville, Ron House, Swearing at Motorists, Thee Shams, and more still to be announced.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT AQUABEAR LEGION</strong><br/>Aquabear Legion is a website and music collective based in Athens, Ohio. Since 2004, Aquabear has worked with over 250 bands and dozens of visual artists and filmmakers. And in that time produced 13 releases including compilations of Ohio music both physical and for free on aquabearlegion.com. We put out our first vinyl compilation in 2015 (Volume 5), and followed up with another in 2017 (Volume 6). </p>
<p>To help raise money for our new release we are offering not only the first copies of the new Volume 7 vinyl compilation with art from Athens' own Chris Biester, and the first copies of our Mother of Presidents cassette compilation, but also Aquabear t-shirts, hoodies, colored vinyl, and countless random Aquabear items we might send along. We sincerely appreciate your support of this project.</p>
<p>Our projects are funded to cover that project. With your support we can make it happen.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?</strong><br/>That is a great question and we love transparency, here is a rough breakdown below. Our $5,500 goal is the number that could cover making 300 copies of the vinyl compilation and 200 copies of the cassette, fully packaged with artwork and shipped out to all of you wonderful people and record stores across the state. It also helps Aquabear Legion continue to sustain itself with some new merchandise for this project! This amount also covers marketing, shipping, general Aquabear expenses, supplies, and crowdfunding fees we incur. <br/><br/>In addition we have also included our annual costs for Aquabear Legion for two years in this fundraiser (around $500) this includes $$ for our web hosting, p.o. box, bank account business fees, and maybe even a few other necessities if there is any left over. We want to start putting out more things, having the safety of net of some basic expenses that we need to exist would be a huge help.</p>
<p><strong>COSTS</strong><br/>*all costs are estimated and subject to change<br/>Records (300):   $1500<br/>Record Jackets (300):   $500<br/>Inserts for Record:  $300<br/>Cassette Production:  $500<br/>Mastering:   $250<br/>Download Codes:  $200<br/>Shipping:  $500<br/>Sleeves/Other Costs:   $100<br/>Marketing:   $300<br/>Crowdsourcing Platform Fees:   $500<br/>Art production:   $200<br/>Licensing + Other Distribution Costs:  $150<br/>Aquabear Legion Business Expenses:  $500</p>

<p><strong>WHAT YOU GET</strong><br/>Two awesome albums of Ohio music that you are helping to put out, plus special rewards at higher levels like hoodies, other Aquabear releases, Aquabear t-shirts, and colored vinyl.</p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong><br/>We are excited to release this amazing music on record, cassette, download, and streaming, and send them all around Ohio and the world. </p>
<p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong><br/>This will be our third vinyl release in this format, second cassette and our fourth crowdsourcing/pre-order campaign since 2011. In 2017 we released Aquabear Legion Volume 6, and in 2015 we released Aquabear Legion Volume 5, both after successful Indiegogo pre-order campaigns, so we are aware of the general challenges in releasing a compilation on vinyl. Aquabear Legion has been working with musicians in Ohio since 2004 and Volume 7 will mark our 13th release, and out Archival Ohio cassette will be our 14th release.</p>
<p>We have already set up a plan to work with Ohio based businesses for the entire process and production of these projects. This is a model we have worked to adhere to for the past 15 years. Artwork will be produced locally here in Athens County and made by hand. Records will be pressed at Musicol Recording Company in Columbus, jackets printed at Gotta Groove Records in Cleveland, and cassettes produced by A to Z Audio in Cleveland. </p>
<p>If there are any delays, mishaps, or anything else Aquabear will make sure to address any issues that will arise and contact any and all backers to keep them updated. We view all supporters and backers of this project as direct contributors. And promise to put out a rad record, tape, and some more cool stuff if you support it.</p>

I'm a singer-songwriter. </p><p>I've set up this Crowdfunder to ask for your help to raise money for my new music video.</p><p>I’ve written an album inspired by my life story and the first single from the album called “I Won’t Wait”, needs a music video shooting.</p><p>But for now let me tell you more about myself, my story and what the whole album is all about...</p><p>I went through some real challenges in my childhood, starting with the death of my father aged 14, that had such a profound effect on me. We didn't have it easy as a family.  I went through bullying and abuse in high school, and this continued into my adult life. All these experiences  have caused me to be very insecure most of my life. Therefore I struggled with  mental health  myself, which caused me a lot of struggles and difficult situations. </p><p>I could be in a much worse place now if I'd continued to live in that way. But somehow I knew it is not gonna be like this forever. I’ve had my passion -  singing. Music was what kept me going. it started from early childhood. I used to sing for hours as a child and it was a way how I used to get away from negative feelings , a way  of cleansing myself. I used to sing in such an emotional way it made me feel better. I knew I had something special that I didn't want to waste so I’ve  decided to follow my dreams. </p><p>Despite having no support I dedicated myself to singing, and it was and it is the purpose of my life. I believe that music can have a powerful impact on people’s emotions.</p><p>I'm not trying to make you feel sorry for me. I'm happy now and accept myself as I am.. I'm leaving  the past behind me, and I’m excited about my future and my upcoming projects.</p><p> I’ve written the album because I know there are many people out there with similar problems who struggle with mental health or to accept themselves and find a purpose in life. I'd like to inspire them through my life story.

I'm a singer-songwriter. I've set up this Crowdfunder to ask for your help to raise money for my new music video.I’ve written an album inspired by my life story and the first single from the album called “I Won’t Wait”, needs a music video shooting.But for now let me tell you more about myself, my story and what the whole album is all about...I went through some real challenges in my childhood, starting with the death of my father aged 14, that had such a profound effect on me. We didn't have it easy as a family.  I went through bullying and abuse in high school, and this continued into my adult life. All these experiences  have caused me to be very insecure most of my life. Therefore I struggled with  mental health  myself, which caused me a lot of struggles and difficult situations. I could be in a much worse place now if I'd continued to live in that way. But somehow I knew it is not gonna be like this forever. I’ve had my passion -  singing. Music was what kept me going. it started from early childhood. I used to sing for hours as a child and it was a way how I used to get away from negative feelings , a way  of cleansing myself. I used to sing in such an emotional way it made me feel better. I knew I had something special that I didn't want to waste so I’ve  decided to follow my dreams. Despite having no support I dedicated myself to singing, and it was and it is the purpose of my life. I believe that music can have a powerful impact on people’s emotions.I'm not trying to make you feel sorry for me. I'm happy now and accept myself as I am.. I'm leaving  the past behind me, and I’m excited about my future and my upcoming projects. I’ve written the album because I know there are many people out there with similar problems who struggle with mental health or to accept themselves and find a purpose in life. I'd like to inspire them through my life story. I hope when they listen to my songs they will find the strength to cope.On the album you can find songs  about forgiveness, about loving and accepting yourself as well as feeling like you’d like to be back to being innocent as a child is.If you struggle with mental health or to find purpose in life. If you’re  feeling lonely or like you don’t fit. I’m here to let  you  know through my music that you’re not alone with your problems that you are beautiful as you are full of potential and your life  can be meaningful.So that's why I'm asking you to donate to my crowd-funder, as shooting a music video is such a expensive thing, but it would help me to create such a special  video for all the people out there. There are many options to purchase some great perks or you could simply donate . Please help me  to make it happen. It will mean world to me ❤️Here is a song I’d like to shoot tnę video for :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIJ4l95_24Y",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>PUSH Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm <a href=""http://jocelynmackenzie.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jocelyn Mackenzie</a>, and I'm a musician, maker, and medium. I'm proud to introduce my debut full-length solo album PUSH, now available for pre-order before its release on <a href=""https://righteousbabe.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Righteous Babe Records</a> in early 2021.</p>
<p>PUSH is a collection of pop songs about healing through radical self love, and it is arranged entirely for string quartet. These songs alchemized my most intimate experiences into powerful anthems of hope, transformation, and survival, and I'm so excited for you to hear them. </p>
<p>By blending chamber music with pop hooks and synth beats, my arrangers and I created a sound for the album that is vibrant, intimate, refreshing, and empowering. The team at Righteous Babe Records agreed, and I'm honored to join their roster of legacy artists for my debut full-length release.</p>
<p>Together with Righteous Babe, we're gathering the final resources to finally place PUSH into your hands. I can't wait to share the gift of this music with you! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598928828/uezyvms1qobjzry3wkge.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><u>THE SONGS</u>: These songs are deeply powerful, personal anthems about healing through radical self love. </strong>Writing these songs got me through some of the hardest times in my life. They are deeply vulnerable, genuine expressions of joy, pain, loss, and renewal. This is my best work yet, and I'm proud to share it with to you!</li>
<li>
<strong><u>THE COMPOSERS</u>: PUSH was co-created a star-studded lineup of composers. </strong>Once written, I handed my songs off to five talented composers to arrange them for string quartet, which is something I don't know how to do.

Hi! I'm Jocelyn Mackenzie, and I'm a musician, maker, and medium. I'm proud to introduce my debut full-length solo album PUSH, now available for pre-order before its release on Righteous Babe Records in early 2021.
PUSH is a collection of pop songs about healing through radical self love, and it is arranged entirely for string quartet. These songs alchemized my most intimate experiences into powerful anthems of hope, transformation, and survival, and I'm so excited for you to hear them. 
By blending chamber music with pop hooks and synth beats, my arrangers and I created a sound for the album that is vibrant, intimate, refreshing, and empowering. The team at Righteous Babe Records agreed, and I'm honored to join their roster of legacy artists for my debut full-length release.
Together with Righteous Babe, we're gathering the final resources to finally place PUSH into your hands. I can't wait to share the gift of this music with you! 



THE SONGS: These songs are deeply powerful, personal anthems about healing through radical self love. Writing these songs got me through some of the hardest times in my life. They are deeply vulnerable, genuine expressions of joy, pain, loss, and renewal. This is my best work yet, and I'm proud to share it with to you!

THE COMPOSERS: PUSH was co-created a star-studded lineup of composers. Once written, I handed my songs off to five talented composers to arrange them for string quartet, which is something I don't know how to do. What they wrote surpassed my wildest dreams! Together, we created something more beautiful than anything I could have made independently.

Sam McCormally: My right hand man on this project, co-producer, and creator of all of the beats for the record. Member of Fellow Creatures, Ugly Purple Sweater, and composer of seven documentary films. PUSH would not have materialized without Sam!

Emily Hope Price: The immensely talented cellist, Broadway musician, film composer, and singer/songwriter. Fellow member of Pearl and the Beard (of course). 

Franz Nicolay: Allstar multi-instrumentalist, author, co-producer of Pearl and the Beard's album Killing the Darlings, member of The Hold Steady, World Inferno Friendship Society, and much more. 

Patrick Breiner: Clarinetist, composer, educator, and member of Bing & Ruth, Battle Trance, and much more.

Adam Schatz: Multi-instrumentalist, writer, record producer, and PUSH string quartet engineer. Member of Landlady, touring member of Sylvan Esso, and much more. 




 
What I Need & What You Get
Here's where your funds will go and what I have to do to get PUSH into your hands:

I need to pay to get PUSH mastered. 
I need to pay some of the artists that already worked on PUSH.A large portion of this campaign will go toward paying back the musicians and engineers who agreed to work on this album with no guarantee of when I would be able to pay them. They have already given their time, talent, and hard work... let's get these artists paid! 

I need to pay for the production of physical merchandise for you, such as the tee shirt (designed by me!) and PUSH on vinyl.
I need to pay to promote this thing! I want as many people as possible to hear this music, so I'm hiring a team of PR and radio agents, as well as social media ad fees. 
There are lots of admin and overhead costs, such as platform fees, taxes, and shipment costs. 

EVERYONE who funds the album receives a digital download of PUSH before it is released on Righteous Babe!  
The following offerings are available only here on Indiegogo for the minimum of these amounts, but if you are moved to offer more, it is much appreciated! ALL offerings include a digital download of PUSH before it's released on Righteous Babe Records. 
 


 
The Impact
The world needs good music right now.

As PUSH's first song Better says, ""The whole world's in the flux of a fever."" This song was written over five years ago, and I had no idea how true these words would become. 
In this time of quarantine, social justice, and political unrest, I am craving human connection now more than ever, and having to find creative solutions to cultivate it in new ways. PUSH is a conduit of human connection.
This album has created itself in divine harmony with the universe all along. Every collaborator, every musician, and every note in every song said a big YES to their role in it, and I believe it all happened in divine timing so that you could hear it.


 
Risks & Challenges
The biggest risk I face by not meeting my funding goals is not being able to pay the musicians who already worked so hard on PUSH, at a time when musicians are struggling to find work.
If I don't meet my funding goals, l will continue to fund this record as I have been over time, slowly and incrementally out of pocket, with your help and with the generosity and patience of my collaborators.
Another risk and challenge is... well... the state of the world. There's not much I can do about that, but if you're patient with me and my team as we change what we can together, I know this music will make the world a better place.

 
Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you can't contribute financially, that doesn't mean you can't help!

Spread the word about PUSH to the people you know who you think would like the album! It's thoughtful for them, and meaningful for me.

<p>Hello there, my name is <strong><a href=""http://RickLeeJames.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rick Lee James</a></strong>. I'm a worship leader, singer and songwriter, speaker, author, and Podcast host with over twenty years of experience in ministry. Over the years I've had the honor of sharing the gospel through music in numerous venues from the National Worship Leader Conference to the world famous Ryman Auditorium.</p>
<ul><li><u><strong>What is this album and why is it important to me?</strong></u></li></ul>
<p>Rich Mullins is an artist whose music moves me in such a way that through it, I honestly think I can hear God speaking. I have prayed on many occasions, “God, please let me write music that leads people to you in the way that Rich Mullins music has done for me.” So when Randy Cox, Rich Mullins' first publisher, called me to ask if I would be willing to record some of Rich’s unfinished songs, I was both elated and terrified that such an honor would be entrusted to me. It quite honestly hit me like loud clap of thunder would. I wasn’t expecting it and I was in awe after I heard it. This is quite appropriate because the song by Rich that we have already recorded is called, <strong>THUNDER</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515113333/y6yfnc3h51ctxkg68v7u.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Amazingly, there is a line in <strong>""Thunder""</strong> that describes what the Holy Spirit has been moving me to do with this new album:</p>
<p><i><strong>“It sounded like thunder when you cleared the temple.”</strong></i></p>
<p>Those words put me in awe, because my belief is that the temple of modern worship music could use some “clearing”. By “clearing the temple,” I mean that there aren’t a lot of popular worship songs that explore with candor the depths of the entire human experience. We don’t often sing about loving our enemies or struggling with the absence of God. We have very few worship songs that help our people sing when they don’t even know if God is there? Maybe the temple needs to be cleared out a bit to help us see what worship looks like in those moments?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>It is in this spirit that I am setting out to make this new record. It's a combination of my original songs, hymns I've re-imagined, and unpublished music by the late Rich Mullins.</strong></i></p>

<p>I’ve already started recording this album with my super-talented friends, <a href=""http://brothersmcclurg.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Brothers McClurg</strong></a> at <strong>Old Bear Studio</strong> in Buffalo, New York. Chris Hoisington, of Brothers McClurg, is producing the project and he has been an amazing collaborator to work with.  Most of the songs on this record will be originals, but <u><i><strong>Rich’s song, Thunder, will be the opening track.</strong></i></u></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Thunder will be the perfect musical announcement that this album intends to carry on the Ragamuffin tradition of being like Jesus and turning over the tables.</strong></i></p>

<p> </p>
<ul><li><u><strong>What We Need?</strong></u></li></ul>
<p>To meet the financial needs for this recording, we have set our goal at $10,200. There are many complex aspects that go into a live recording like this. The money will go to things like paying for studio time, the producer, the musicians, the engineers, the videographers, the photographers, all pre and post production of the project before and after the album, the printing of CDs, and the distribution of the album to all major distributors, and none of this includes promoting the album once it releases or any of the money I've already paid to record the first two songs.</p>
<p>Basically, in addition to what I've already spent out of my own pocket (over $2000),  this album will cost a little over $1000 a track. It's a huge deal to make a project like this, and I know I have no ability to fund this project on my own. However, with God's help and the generosity of good people like you, there's nothing we can't do. When you partner with us, you're helping to release a unique and powerful record into the world that carries on a legacy of comforting the disturbed and disturbing the comfortable, both inside and outside the walls of the Church.</p>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<h3>What's it all about?</h3>
<p>I have been in love with music my entire life. Still, I initially backed away from pursuing a music career, for all the familiar reasons: 'You won't make any money, there is too much competition, better keep music as a hobby.' At 26 I found myself burnt out from working over hours at a job I did not care for. I decided, after all, to quit and follow my purpose.</p>
<p>I have since released my debut EP Skipper Canyon Road, which received critical acclaim from major Dutch national radio channel NPO2 among others. Last summer I toured through the Netherlands with my 'Just A Drifter' show. I plan to record and produce a full album this fall - with help of this crowdfunding campaign and your contribution!</p>
<div> </div>
<h2>The Specs</h2>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I aim to fund one third (€5000) of the production costs through crowdfunding. The funds from this campaign will contribute to the total €15.000 it takes to professionally record and produce the album. With this money I can hire a producer, session musicians, and rent a studio; as well as hire a photographer and graphic designer for the album cover - among other stuff that's needed to produce a stellar record.</li>
<li>All contributions over $10 will be rewarded with super cool perks. Check the campaign page for details - anything is possible, from personal cover songs to merch packages to life-long VIP status. You will also receive updates on the production process, fun promo stuff, and of course be the first to know when the release will happen so you can get your hands on the album. Early bird alert: If your contribution is amongst the first 10, you will receive an additional secret perk!</li>
<li>Please note that Indiegogo only supports credit card payments. No credit card? No problem. Send me a message at info@laurakits.com</li>
</ul>
<p>If I don't reach the crowdfunding goal, I will not be able to create the album with all of the songs and at the production quality that I aim for. So let's not have that happen!</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<h3>What does it mean to support this project?</h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>If you are a music lover, you care about good songs. In my songwriting I put an emphasis on lyrics. I want them to be poetic, real, honest, and with a sense of humor. But the music is just as important - no programmed licks and zero computer drums, all of it has to be real, recorded by the best musicians. If you like Miranda Lambert, The Band Perry, Carrie Underwood, Bruce Springsteen, Dolly Parton or the Nashville tv show soundtrack, to name a few, I promise you you will enjoy this album too.</li>
<li>I have already successfully recorded, produced and released an EP with seven songs in 2017. You can find Skipper Canyon Road on <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/nl/album/skipper-canyon-road/1222890918?l=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">iTunes</a>, <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/6nC4B6ZCUCapniSXxBXqY7?si=saW9JevKRC20fPTFPVjyIA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Spotify</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOUWQPqNj-8j4qV8HDWe4-Q"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YouTube</a>. It has been picked up by several Dutch radio channels and international Spotify playlists. So I know what I am doing - although that was just the start.</li>
<li>The music industry is a heck-a-difficult scene to break into. It takes hard work and lots of patience. And let's be honest: Funding goes a long way in creating high quality productions. I saved money while working full time, and I happily invest this in my future as an artist. This crowdfunding campaign should not only complement those funds with some hard-needed extra money, but also serve as a PR campaign to bring myself and my music to an audience of international music lovers.</li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have a detailed plan and budgeting for the recording and production phase. I am working with professionals I trust and whom I have worked with before. I have seen and agreed to the production costs up front, so there will be no surprises. With my strategy consulting background, I am confident that I can manage this project without wasting time and money. The main challenge is whether I will succeed in promoting the record at the scale I aim to. For that, I am thoroughly researching my options for both an indie release with a PR firm, or a label deal. And I am working with a social media professional to rev up the promotion engine. This is all part of the project, and therefore my responsibility. Of course, in the end, the success of the album is also in the hands of listeners. I will do everything on my end to make sure listeners get the best music I can give them.</p>

<h3>""Opera For Everyone: Who Had The Worst Day?""</h3>
<p>Nothing was right. You woke up late, you spilled coffee on the way out, you got a flat tire, you grabbed the wrong folder for an important meeting, your phone died, you’re tired, you’re hungry, and you just want to scream. You’re having a very bad day. Opera characters, like you and me, sometimes have a ""terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.""</p>
<p>We have some of the best up-and-coming opera singers from our city joining us and we want to share their superb talent with you: Calvin Griffin, bass-baritone, Adelaide Boedecker, soprano, Nathan Munson, tenor, and Kaitlyn Costello, mezzo-soprano. Recent Atlanta Opera Studio Artist alumna Brenna Corner will be hosting and directing the evening, and our own Chaowen Ting will be conducting the orchestra.</p>
<p>This event will take place on September 16th at 4 pm at Kellett Chapel in Peachtree Presbyterian Church and is free of charge.</p>
<p>Sunday, September 16th at 4pm<br/>Kellett Chapel in Peachtree Presbyterian Church <br/>3434 Roswell Rd NW, Atlanta, Georgia 30305<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Is Our Goal?</h3>
<p>Our goal for this concert is to highlight the human struggles that these characters share with us, in a genre of music that, for some, feels unrelatable and ancient. We also want to showcase our local talent to our community and bring you an afternoon of beautiful music.</p>
<p>Our goal as an organization is to connect the community with high-quality performances of a broad variety of vocal repertoire. Our seasons include intimate recitals and classical operas that resonate with present-day audiences. We offer professional experiences and opportunities for emerging artists from, but not limited to, the Greater Atlanta area. VAA is passionate about making classical vocal arts and operatic singing accessible to a wide range of audiences including children, young adults, and under-served groups while nurturing young talents.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will ensure we can compensate our local artists what they are worth and offer future programming that will bring high-quality performances to underserved communities and audiences that perhaps have never had access to live classical music. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The best way to help other than financially is to spread the word and come to our shows. We believe we can make a huge impact in our community and we need all the support we can get. You can share this Indiegogo directly to your social media or via email.</p>

<p>I'm betting that since you've made your way to this page, you already know a bit about me. If not, thank you for coming, just the same. I started playing guitar when I was a kid. Just me on my bedroom floor with a Washburn and a live John Mayer DVD. I would pause and play each frame until my fingers matched the chords. Couldn't have known then how much that would change my life.</p>
<p>At that age, I never imagined music would be a centrifuge of my career; I only knew that it was a place I felt safe to be myself. For the last 7 years, my full-time endeavors in a worship band have soaked up a lot of my songwriting time. But in more recent days, I've been able to go back to my bedroom floor and write some songs just for me. </p>
<p>Well, I mean, I<i> thought</i> they were just for me. I can't help but to write songs out of necessity;  because I need a space to feel what I have a hard time verbalizing otherwise. In these last seasons, I've learned how rich life can be when you dare to be honest with yourself and those around you. Honest about what's happened. Honest about who you are and who you want to be. This little EP is the result of a deeply rooted desire to be transparent with this one life that I've been given; to offer up what I've experienced in hopes that you can feel through music what you might be afraid to feel without it. </p>
<p>I found some space to heal.</p>
<p>And I hope that these songs help you find yours.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>So Why the Crowd-Funding?</h3>
<p>Everyone knows music-making is expensive so I won't bore you with the facts and figures. Here's the quick break-down;</p>
<ul>
<li>This project has cost me lots of money. Don't worry about how much. Just know that the money I make here is going towards paying for it.</li>
<li>I'm only printing one run of hard copies of this EP. It will only be available digitally after this campaign ends.</li>
<li>I have 100 Limited Edition Hard Copy Packages for sale. If you want one, you gotta get it here! And you gotta get it now!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What's in it for you?</h3>
<p>You're going to get a lot of content that adds to the experience of these songs. Here...I'll give you the breakdown.</p>
<ul>
<li>You're gonna get the Digital Copy of the EP the minute I have it. March 6. Everyone else has to wait for it to come out on iTunes later in the month.</li>
<li>You're gonna get an immediate download of the single JACKSON which you currently can only listen to here on the interwebs.</li>
<li>You're gonna get a full-color, replica sticker of my geometric buffalo tattoo. Let me explain: Jackson, WY is a literal space where I saw a different side of God than I'd seen before. I did a lot of healing there and my tat helps me remember how to get back to that when I need to. </li>
<li>You're gonna get a voice-memo bonus track of one of my original songs, and also a voice-memo bonus track of a never-before-heard Water Within song. (NO BIG DEAL, RIGHT?!)</li>
<li>Finally, you'll see some behind the scenes footage of studio sessions, stories behind the songs, and interviews.</li>
<li>Oh and DUH, you'll get one of the 100-ever-printed-in-the-world hard copies of SPACE TO HEAL. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>We've Only Got 30 Days</h3>
<ul>
<li>Once the 100 pre-orders are gone, THEY'RE GONE. I have no idea what to expect. Maybe only a few people will be super interested in this? But maybe a lot of people will be and then if you wait til the last minute, it'll be sad because you might miss out! </li>
<li>Feel free to share this around and tell your friends! Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, you know the drill. </li>
</ul>
</div><p>Thanks for giving this a listen! I'm excited to share this piece of me with all of you guys!</p><p>-Whit</p></div>","Hello friends,

<h2><strong>Our Story</strong></h2>
<p>We are Lodz Jewish Heritage Foundation trying to make our voice for peace and friendship heard.  We were funded in 2002 and we have made an imprint on Lodz cultural stage with Yiddish film festivals, workshops for kids and adults, day-camps etc.</p>
<p>Some stories capture your heart and imagination from the very first words you hear.  They have a long lasting impact. If you hear them as a child they can mould your behavior and influence your life for the years to come. The right story can make a huge impact on our future. We are going to tell such a story to children and youth. </p>
<p>We are teaming together with Lodz Children's Choir (which frequently performs in Hebrew and Yiddish) and Lodz Philharmonics to stage a compassionate musical for kids. It tells a true story about the antisemitic mass media campaign in 1968 Poland that forced 12,000 people to leave the country into uncertain future with one way ticket and no passport.  Our musical tells a tale of two friends (Polish and Jewish girls) who live through that difficult time and cultivate their friendship throughout the ordeal as well as afterwards through decades in separation. The ladies are still friends even today! We plan to show their pictures on big screen at the end of the show.  They will be our honored guests at the performance.</p>
<p>We feel strongly that this musical will play an important role in shaping ideals of young people as well as their sensitivity to human rights violation. They will know how to combat antisemitism, racism and xenophobia. The music, multimedia presentation (with the use of social media), the different art forms employed in the show and the plot go hand in hand engaging children, keeping them interested in the story and educating them at the same time.</p>
<p>With your help we can shape the future. We can make our World a better, more compassionate and friendly place. By educating the children we give them the power to make changes for better tomorrow. There is a need to combat antisemitism we encounter in social media and more and more often expressed in the open. Only by shaping the sensibilities of kids and youth we can hope for peace in the future.</p>
<p>Can you imagine being a part of musical revolution? Revolution that steers children into a future where they embrace the difference and fight for justice? The songs you help to perform will be sang by the children over and over again reinforcing the peaceful message. They will be recorded and played at home, on social media, in a car. You will truly become a peaceful worrier. Let's hope that with your help we will combat antisemitism.  </p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<p>The total cost of the performance is $75,000 euro. So far we secured $35,000. </p>
<p>We received $25,000 from the Lodz Marshalls Office to pay for the cost of:  rehearsals and performance of Lodz Philharmonic Orchestra, cost of compositions, arrangements, musical scores for orchestra and soloists, conducting, musical Director of the performance, voice emission, children's choir's rehearsals and performance  </p>
<p>Further we secured $10,000 from the Ministry of Culture to pay for the sound system at the Lodz Train Station where the performance will take part, for the right to use this public space and for security guards.</p>
<p>We still need $40,000 to pay for the multimedia presentation, lights, graphic designers,  animation, the dance group rehearsals and performance, for ambulance on site, professional recording of DVD from the show, to pay for the interpreters for the deaf people and translators to Hebrew and English, for the professional actors and costumes, make-up, for scenography and insurance etc.</p>
<h2>Perks</h2>
<p>We have a broad array of perks including a Membership in a Private Facebook Supporters Group (with sneak previews), personalized ringtone with a  tune from our musical sang by our Choir, Skype Chat with Maestro or our Director, Dance workshops with a World Modern Dance Champion, Signed Photos, Posters, Few-Nights Hotel Stay in Lodz, City Guided Tours, Trips to varied Polish Cities to name a few. Please check the details. Make sure you check our campaign often. There will be new perks listed now and then.</p>If we do not gather all the funds needed for the show we will still try to stage it in a limited version (smaller cast, smaller venue perhaps, no DVD). If we receive very little funds, we will keep those funds towards our next year production of Holocaust themed performance about Litzmanstadt Ghetto.<br/> </div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are staging this interdisciplinary art performance at the modern, spacious <a href=""https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fd-pt.ppstatic.pl%2Fkadry%2Fk%2Fr%2F1%2F51%2F13%2F584d6938e5af1_o%2Csize%2C1068x623%2Cq%2C71%2Ch%2C2b4dc8.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dzienniklodzki.pl%2Fwiadomosci%2Flodz%2Ffabryczny%2Fa%2Fotwarcie-dworca-lodz-fabryczna-tlumy-lodzian-na-nowym-dworcu-foto%2C11564859%2F&amp;docid=DiMSANh7CaXM_M&amp;tbnid=OqQf5pinJaiZTM%3A&amp;vet=10ahUKEwi1z8unx8LbAhXNKVAKHd1ZAH4QMwg1KAMwAw..i&amp;w=1068&amp;h=623&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;bih=618&amp;biw=1247&amp;q=%C5%82%C3%B3d%C5%BA%20fabryczna&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1z8unx8LbAhXNKVAKHd1ZAH4QMwg1KAMwAw&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lodz Train Station</a>, using public space to send a strong message. The Station is a really big venue frequented by a lot of travelers as well as a popular destination of Lodz inhabitants due to the Station's modern design.</p>
<p>The show will be broadcast on social media, the TV will run coverage about this event and the newspapers will cover it as well. It will also be recorded on DVD. This huge event has a potential of reaching tens of thousands of people. We have people from other Polish cities interested in the event and ready to travel. We have high schools interested in the performance. We are expecting several thousand people present at the opening night. Many more watching while the show is being streamed. It will show them that the art can be experienced in many different ways.</p>
<p>Just like the venue, this performance is different and modern. As an multidisciplinary event, it will combine symphony music, song, dance, animation and theater. We will have several stages built for the performance. The actors and the public will move alongside with the action. It will be also broadcast on big screens at the station. As the real story ended at the train station when the friends had to say teary goodbyes, our show will end there as well.</p>
<p>We are very excited about our project. As it is aimed mainly at kids and youth, it will change the way young people see modern history. It will teach them critical thinking, compassion and standing by their principles. Most of all it will show them the true meaning of friendship.</p>
<p>The Lodz Jewish Heritage Foundation has a track record of staging shows (four so far), workshops, film festivals etc. It works closely with Lodz Film Academy and Lodz Arts Academy supporting young artists who chose to to do work arising from rich Jewish history of the region. This event will be the biggest so far and at the same time it will have the biggest impact.</p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
</div><div>
<p>Time is our biggest challenge. We are trying to race gather enough money to stage our musical at the end of November. If we miss our deadline we will lose the money secured from the   Marshal's Office and the Ministry. We are still looking for alternative sources of financing.  We are talking to private donors and cultural institutions. We are confident we can meet our deadline.  We love our project and we will make sure it will happen.</p>
<p>Another, smaller concern is getting a proper sound and lighting system for the Lodz ""Fabryczna"" Train Station. We are getting the best professional crew in our town to make sure the audience will be delighted with the end result.</p>

<h3>Two trios, one record</h3>
<p>I have been living in Colombia for ten years, loving every minute of it, and I have been wanting to make a record that brings together both of my worlds. One half of the record will be an American group, the other half Colombian. I've selected 12 original compositions for the recording, many of which are new, some older that I haven't recorded, and some that I've never recorded in this format. I hope you'll consider supporting the record. Here are some things that are all ready to go :</p>
<ul>
<li>The musicians are on board. These are some of the coolest people I know and it is an honor that they want to make this record with me.</li>
<li>The studio is selected. It is a really beautiful place and we will have it all to ourselves. We'll be staying at the studio and we can record and rehearse at our leisure. </li>
<li>The record label Música Corriente is going to distribute the recording and help with logistics. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funding for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bringing the musicians to Medellín</li>
<li>Paying the musicians</li>
<li>Paying the studio costs and mixing/mastering</li>
<li>Pressing the record</li>
</ul>
<p>The things we are offering for your help:</p>
<ul>
<li>A digital download of the recording</li>
<li>The CD</li>
<li>The lead sheets to the tunes</li>
<li>mini polaroids of the recording session</li>
<li>LPs of other projects I'm on from Música Corriente's catalogue</li>
<li>Producer Credits</li>
<li>Song Dedications</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3>Challenges</h3></div><div><p>This is quite the undertaking but we do have many of the details worked out. We have the dates tentatively confirmed with the musicians and the studio. Thankfully, the studio is very reasonably priced and since there is lodging at the studio, that is another cost already taken care of. The record label is going to take care of a lot of things I wouldn't know how to do. They'll prepare the artwork and text, organize the pressing of the record, distribute the physical copies and release the record to iTunes and streaming services. The biggest challenge is financing travel costs and paying five musicians. </p></div><div>

</div></div>","Two trios, one record
I have been living in Colombia for ten years, loving every minute of it, and I have been wanting to make a record that brings together both of my worlds. One half of the record will be an American group, the other half Colombian. I've selected 12 original compositions for the recording, many of which are new, some older that I haven't recorded, and some that I've never recorded in this format. I hope you'll consider supporting the record. Here are some things that are all ready to go :

The musicians are on board. These are some of the coolest people I know and it is an honor that they want to make this record with me.
The studio is selected. It is a really beautiful place and we will have it all to ourselves. We'll be staying at the studio and we can record and rehearse at our leisure. 
The record label Música Corriente is going to distribute the recording and help with logistics. 


What We Need & What You Get
We need funding for:

Bringing the musicians to Medellín
Paying the musicians
Paying the studio costs and mixing/mastering
Pressing the record

The things we are offering for your help:

A digital download of the recording
The CD
The lead sheets to the tunes
mini polaroids of the recording session
LPs of other projects I'm on from Música Corriente's catalogue
Producer Credits
Song Dedications

ChallengesThis is quite the undertaking but we do have many of the details worked out. We have the dates tentatively confirmed with the musicians and the studio. Thankfully, the studio is very reasonably priced and since there is lodging at the studio, that is another cost already taken care of. The record label is going to take care of a lot of things I wouldn't know how to do. They'll prepare the artwork and text, organize the pressing of the record, distribute the physical copies and release the record to iTunes and streaming services. The biggest challenge is financing travel costs and paying five musicians.

<h3>A Celebration of George Jones</h3>
<p>Ask anyone, ""Who's the greatest singer in country music?"" Chances are they'll reply, ""<strong>George Jones</strong>."" From his start as a flat-topped honky-tonker to his reign as king of the country crooners, George’s hit-making career spanned the history of country music after WWII.  He scored number one hits in four different decades and helped to define the art of singing country music.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, <strong>Crying Time</strong> has played a Tribute to George Jones show at the Ivy Room, Armando's, and the Freight and Salvage to sold-out crowds and rave reviews. We'll be back at the Ivy Room and Armando's this Fall, with a studio album of some of the songs from those shows, featuring some of the Bay Area's top Country/Honkytonk/Americana performers in celebration of George's heart-breaking and boot-stomping songs. The album also features extra special guest, steel guitar legend <strong>Bobby Black</strong>, who appeared on some of George's early Starday releases.</p>
<p>In addition to Mr. Black, performers include <strong>Maurice Tani</strong>, <strong>Val Esway</strong>, <strong>Joe Rut</strong>, the <strong>Loretta Lynch Trio</strong>, and <strong>Danny Allen</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Money in this Deal</h3>
<p>We've recorded the album at Myles Boisen's Guerrilla Recording Studio. Henry Rowe, the son of Crying Time drummer and the genius behind How to Play the Drums, Tim Rowe, has created a fabulous portrait of The Possum for the cover. The CDs are being printed  at Discmakers. As you know, all this takes $$$. You can help us recoup funds by pre-ordering the CD. We've got some other great perks for you, as well. Read on!</p>

<h3>About me and this crowdfunding project</h3>
<p>Hello my dear,</p>
<p>I am MARA and I went through a professional education as a classical cellist at ""Hochschule für Musik FRANZ LISZT"" in Weimar/Germany and ""Conservatoire National Superiór de Musique et Danse"" in Lyon/France. After following the career of a typical cellist and holding jobs at several German theater orchestras (Weimar, Wiesbaden, Mainz, Stuttgart, Ulm) I decided to finally bring my own music into this world. It all started during a master class with jazz cellist Stephan Braun, who inspired me to improvise and to create original music. I then completed my studies in ""Improvisation for Strings"" at the ""Anton Bruckner Private University"" in Linz, where I learned new techniques on the cello and delved deeper into jazz and other genres, and eventually started to sing to my own accompaniments. </p>
<p>This year (2018) everything started and my dreams (those I never dared to have) came true: I played my first solo concert in April, comprising mostly of my newly arranged or composed music (I only played two pieces which were originally for cello: Peteris Vasks's 'Pianissimo' and Mark Summer's 'Julie-O' - two pieces I love so much I couldn't go without). Since then I gave several solo concerts all over Germany and am truly thankful for all the positive feedback I get from everywhere. I call my program <i>""Off the beaten track""</i> because I am exploring new ways of cello music.</p>
<p>My next dream is to produce an album full of my own compositions/arrangements - to share my passion with you. It will be my first album and I will learn so many things while doing it - but I want to capture the best version of my songs and give them to you. I was asked so many times after a concert if I have a CD for sale - Finally I want to be able to say ""Yes""! And in contributing to this crowdfunding campaign you can even choose to get your name printed in the booklet - because you are that special person who will make it all happen!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For the whole CD production I will need minimum 3000€. I chose this amount because it helps me to get going even if there are more costs. Let me break these down for you in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>most costs go to the studio and the all in producer (high quality studio production, sound engineering, mixing)</li>
<li>mastering of the songs</li>
<li>CD pressing (digipack and 4 page booklet)</li>
<li>album and booklet art designer</li>
<li>photographer</li>
<li>GEMA fees</li>
<li>digital distribution </li>
</ul>
<p>I arranged my favorite songs and composed completely new and unique music for cello and my voice. Being one of the very few cellists in the world who sing while playing, this combination is also special in another way: the cello is said to be the instrument closest to the human voice. That alone makes the combination so perfect. But more than that I use the cello as a rhythm instrument or a bass or a guitar. There are many sounds of the cello that are yet to be discovered. You will help me bring my voice out into the world.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my fundraising goal I'll do the production of the CD anyway. A musician's art is rarely captured - it exists only in the moment. It is my lifelong dream to capture my music and to hold it in my hands. To listen to it for as long as I want - like a painter who can look at his artwork anytime he wishes. Or to leave my footprint in this world after I'm gone. Life is too short to not follow our dreams. And all those unpaid hours working behind the scenes doing merchandise and promotion things, I am just starting to learn, have to pay off ;-)</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Of late, nowadays you can get music very cheap. At Spotify or other streaming platforms musicians don't earn much for their music. All the credits for cover songs go to the main composer and not to the artist who covered the song in a new and unique way (I should have made cat videos..!). But still I believe that the world also needs quality music, needs music who doesn't sound the same as everything else. And the world needs music that affects the heart. Even if those streaming platforms don't generate much money, the costs for the production and the printing for us musicians stay the same. I am still in favor of CDs, because you can hold them in your hands, you can have an autograph or a personal message on it - but you can also digitize them. You own the rights for the CD and not Amazon or iTunes (b.t.w. Did you know that you do not have those rights for the music purchased on iTunes and that you are not legally allowed to pass it on to your children after you die?). But - of course - if you favor the digital version, there will be the digital download opportunity.</p>
<p>Your contribution to this project will make a difference in the spirit of music: away from the fast consumption towards handmade and hand produced music made with love. Away from supporting rich super stars towards supporting a musician you actually know and who is thankful for your support (and who is creating everything on her own without the help of a label or an agency). </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is my very first album and everything is so new to me - so this is my biggest challenge. But I am very thankful to have helpful musicians and producers at hand who did CD releases themselves and who I can ask (almost) every question. And if not, I'll make mistakes and learn from them and do better next time. </p>
<p>Another challenge is the planning of the release date. I honestly don't know how much time the production will consume. Or the pressing or artwork or GEMA registration. What I know is that I am going into the studio in January 2019 and I will keep you updated, and hopefully in summer 2019 everything will be ready. Please hold your thumbs.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>

<p>Firstly thank you for reading this far. You would not be here if you weren't genuinely interested in my project. But you may not have the money to contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help. If you are interested in supporting me, please get the word out and make some noise about my campaign. I will be very grateful for that. You can use the Indiegogo share tools to do that or share my video on social media.</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary:</strong></p>
<p>About me: I am a Chicago native but currently based in Nashville/NYC as an independent artist and Sony/ATV Pop songwriter. I write songs for others, I write songs for film/TV and advertisements, and I write songs for myself and for my fans.</p>
<p>Just like everyone else on the planet, I have faced some serious and hard times in my life. I know depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD, and I have battled addiction. I have been in recovery now for 2-1/2 years and continue to climb, grow and change as the layers continue to peel away. </p>
<p>Part of that process for me has been writing, writing, writing. Music has saved my life a million times and will continue to be the place I go for relief and for healing. Over the last two years I have written over 100 songs. For this project, I have narrowed it down to 5 songs. These 5 songs are the songs I will be recording on this next EP; they are my heart and my soul; they are where I am now, and they are where I'm headed. I couldn't be more excited and proud to share these songs with the world. The more I push myself to grow, share and be vulnerable, the more I find it is helping others to heal and grow as well. It's a two way street and I couldn't do it without the support and love from all of you. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Being an independent artist is crazy hard, and it can be really difficult to find ways to put music out because of all the costs involved. But the love and passion I feel from the work I am doing keeps me going and keeps me driven to release music that will make a change. I want this music to have a big impact on the world; I want it to help and inspire people and to uplift those in need of support. In order to do that, I'll need the materials to really get it out into the world. I am raising $30k to fully fund the recording of a new EP, the creation of two music videos, a photo shoot, graphic design, promo materials and a release marketing budget. You will get to be a part of the making. You will get to see first hand how the EP is made from start to finish as I share videos and photos and journal through the process. I'll be asking you, at times, for your opinion on artwork and other decisions that will need to be made and you'll get to weigh in on the creative side. Of course, you'll also get the packages you order ;) </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Two years ago I crowd funded my last release ""Freaks Like Me."" There was a song in that project called ""Somebody's Someone."" It is an autobiographical song dedicated to anyone touched by mental health, addiction or homelessness issues. That song changed my life in the most beautiful way possible.The song now has over 20 Million views/500,000 shares on FaceBook. It has been used in rehabilitation and mental health centers and support groups worldwide. It has been incredible to see the song inspiring people reach out to loved ones in need, reach out to their communities, stay sober, get help and literally save lives.</p>
<p>The songs on this next project will continue to fight that good fight and give a voice to those who don't feel they have one. ""I Am Enough"" is my next ""Somebody's Someone"" and I can't wait to get it out there for everyone to sing a long with. </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>There are no risks. The challenges I face are strictly financial. I have an incredible team of passionate people who are behind this project 200%. We all share the common purpose of spreading some love out there in the world. The more we raise, the better able we are to create an impact with this music. We are going for it!</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you aren't able to contribute financially, that is a-okay! I need ALL the help I can get to get this campaign out there! Please share it with your friends and family? Please make posts and videos about it on your pages and send emails and texts to people sharing the link. The more the merrier, because essentially this campaign is all about getting the message out there that we are not alone in our struggles. Reaching out is the only way to let our loved ones know we are here for them. Let's do this! Thank you so much for supporting this mission! </p>

<p>2018 has already proven to be an incredibly exciting year for the three of us! We are incredibly proud to have been appointed Artists in Residence at the University of Surrey for 2018/19. Working with the country’s future young composers, musicians and arts creators throughout the music and media department is a privilege and a truly rewarding experience. However, keeping the momentum in contemporary music is proving more and more difficult in these times of increasing financial pressure. So, it is essential we strive to ensure a diverse and secure future for music and musicians in the coming years.</p>
<p>We are giving you, our audience and supporters of the Arts a wonderfully unique opportunity to play a part in the progress of 21st Century music.</p>
<p>Our residency at the University of Surrey will culminate with a concert as part of the Guildford International Festival in 2019. We are delighted to be commissioning Stephen Goss, Professor of Composition at the University, to write us an original work which will receive its World Premiere at the Festival.</p>
<p>As part of the Festival’s forward-thinking approach they have generously awarded Trifarious a part-commission fee of £1000. Our task is now to raise the further £2000 to bring the project to full fruition.</p>

</div></div>","2018 has already proven to be an incredibly exciting year for the three of us! We are incredibly proud to have been appointed Artists in Residence at the University of Surrey for 2018/19. Working with the country’s future young composers, musicians and arts creators throughout the music and media department is a privilege and a truly rewarding experience. However, keeping the momentum in contemporary music is proving more and more difficult in these times of increasing financial pressure. So, it is essential we strive to ensure a diverse and secure future for music and musicians in the coming years.
We are giving you, our audience and supporters of the Arts a wonderfully unique opportunity to play a part in the progress of 21st Century music.
Our residency at the University of Surrey will culminate with a concert as part of the Guildford International Festival in 2019. We are delighted to be commissioning Stephen Goss, Professor of Composition at the University, to write us an original work which will receive its World Premiere at the Festival.
As part of the Festival’s forward-thinking approach they have generously awarded Trifarious a part-commission fee of £1000. Our task is now to raise the further £2000 to bring the project to full fruition.
This is where YOU can be involved with this exciting project! We are offering a wonderful variety of perks – ranging from ‘buy a bar’ to ‘dedicate the work’. Your contribution, however big or small, will play an essential part in bringing this project to life and thus provide an invaluable and lasting contribution to the world of new music.

We look forward to hearing from you very soon!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A Ghost For All Seasons is a 5 piece metal band from Reno, NV. Established in 2017, the band has gone through numerous member changes, but has solidified a lineup of stellar musicians/songwriters/performers. We have been playing a lot of shows recently and feel ready to take things to the next level: recording our music and getting it to our friends for their daily enjoyment! With 6 tracks already written and performed live, and 3-4 more being fleshed out in the writing process, we are extremely excited to record these songs for y'all. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>A Ghost For All Seasons knows that you get what you pay for, and we want our metal family to have the best recorded sonic version of our music that we can give you. That's why we are recording with Tom Gordon at Imirage Sound Lab. The cost of this recording is going to be $3,200. With this crowd funded campaign, we are trying to raise $5,000. The remaining $1,800 would be for CD duplication and making/fulfillment of the other perks (which include backer only designs for shirts/hoodies, beanies, signed drum heads and more).</p>
<p>As we are doing a flexible campaign, it we don't raise the entire amount needed for recording of the record, whatever y'all DO contribute will go towards the recording. Above all else, the music is most important here. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As artists, we try to create art that not only will we enjoy and be proud of, but that our metal family will enjoy and be proud to support as well! Your support for AGFAS and this Indiegogo campaign will allow us to continue to focus on the art, rather than stress about how it will be financed. And we are most definitely excited about these songs. We feel we have something positive to offer the metal community, and we hope that you will contribute if you can, and come along for the ride with us. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As I said before, we just recently solidified the AGFAS lineup. That said, we as a band have never tried a crowd fund campaign before, and have no idea how much we will actually be able to raise. We realize that in contributing to our record, you are putting your faith in us to fulfill our campaign promises. We do not take that faith lightly, but hold it up high and THANK YOU for not only supporting us and our art, but for putting your trust in us. Likewise, we proudly place our faith in our metal family to help us with this project. After all, we are in this together!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone can afford to contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't support this campaign. Every time you share this campaign with your friends on all of your social media sites, that's another opportunity for not only more financial contributions, but an opportunity to draw more ears to our music, and to make our metal family even bigger! You don't even have to leave this site in order to share this campaign, as Indiegogo has several tools right here that you can use to spread the word. </p>

<h3>Free Radicals 8th Album: Hip Hop and Vocal Music</h3>
<ul>
<li>Over the last 23 years, we have always collaborated with rappers, poets, spoken word artists, and singers, but this is the first time we will put non-instrumental music at the forefront.</li>
<li>This campaign is your chance to push a Free Radicals project to a new level.</li>
<li>Your help is crucial. We just hope the community that has gotten us this far is ready to help push this project over the top.</li>
<li>This project will help us to pay the guest musicians, vocalists, rappers, poets, etc. Free Radicals bandmembers will not take any money from this campaign for writing, practicing, rehearsing, arranging, recording, or producing for the album. We will make money from live shows and if the album generates income.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We will use this campaign to offer all of our guest artists money upfront for their sessions (in addition to royalties), and invest in recording, duplicating disks, producing professional videos, hiring professionals to promote the album to reviewers and radio, and other logistical. production, promotion, and travel expenses.</li>
<li>We have assembled a unique merchandise collection to help reward our donors.</li>
<li>If we fall short of our financial goal, we're still going to do what we have learned to do over 23 years -- make the best project we possibly can with the resources we have.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

</div></div>","Free Radicals 8th Album: Hip Hop and Vocal Music

Over the last 23 years, we have always collaborated with rappers, poets, spoken word artists, and singers, but this is the first time we will put non-instrumental music at the forefront.
This campaign is your chance to push a Free Radicals project to a new level.
Your help is crucial. We just hope the community that has gotten us this far is ready to help push this project over the top.
This project will help us to pay the guest musicians, vocalists, rappers, poets, etc. Free Radicals bandmembers will not take any money from this campaign for writing, practicing, rehearsing, arranging, recording, or producing for the album. We will make money from live shows and if the album generates income.


What We Need & What You Get

We will use this campaign to offer all of our guest artists money upfront for their sessions (in addition to royalties), and invest in recording, duplicating disks, producing professional videos, hiring professionals to promote the album to reviewers and radio, and other logistical. production, promotion, and travel expenses.
We have assembled a unique merchandise collection to help reward our donors.
If we fall short of our financial goal, we're still going to do what we have learned to do over 23 years -- make the best project we possibly can with the resources we have.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi there, we are Red Sage and we hail from the Mile High City of Denver, Colorado. We have been making waves in Colorado and across the country's music scene for the last 5 years. We have done 3 West Coast tours through California, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, and Arizona. Our last album ""Pick Up The Pieces"" made it to iTunes Top 20 Reggae Albums and stayed on their ""best-seller"" list for nearly 6 months. Last year we made our debut at Reggae Rise Up Utah with some of the scene's biggest artists including Rebelution, SOJA, J Boog, Stephen Marley, Hirie, Fortunate Youth, Zion I, Del Tha Funkee Homosapien, and dozens more. </p>
<p>Our passion for music continues to grow, and we have spent the last few months focusing on composition, stage presence, and how to make a more enjoyable show for you, the listeners.</p>
<p>This campaign would give us a launch into a new ethos of music. We firmly believe this next album will be a representation of everything we are aiming for and the message we are trying to convey. The world may not always be bright and beautiful, but there is a way to find your way there. This campaign would go toward helping us pay for studio time, new merchandise for shows, relaunching the website and online store, and also helping us update our online presence with top quality videos and live performance video.</p>
<p>Any help on this campaign is a major step in helping us reach our dreams and goals as a unit. We have all been musicians for years and every musician's dream is to be sustained by music, and we firmly believe we are on that cusp, all it takes is the final leap, which we are more than ready to take right now.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are aiming for $5,000. Studio time is expensive and this would only pay for a portion of what we are aiming to do, but we are hoping to put some of this money toward merchandise, and video as well as starting on our new album.</p>
<p>If the goal is not reached entirely, we will use what we do get to help with merchandise, that way if nothing else, we can sell merchandise to hopefully raise the studio money we need.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, we will be grateful for any and all help, and we appreciate your generosity deeply.</p>
<p>We will be updating our perks as time goes, but any contribution, even minimum amounts will receive a thank you package, even if just stickers and a hand written note. </p>
<p>$10 will get you added to the ""Thank You"" section of our next studio album</p>
<p>$20 gets you above, plus advance access to our first album single. </p>
<p>$40 will get you all of the above, plus be the first to receive our new album before the world does. We will also sign your copy!</p>
<p>$100 and up- we will reserve an acoustic  backstage performance/ meet and greet for you any time we're in your town. Plus all of the above and your choice of t-shirt.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We feel music is the best medicine for the soul. We promise to stick to our musical mission of uplift and healing through vibration. We aim to connect on a personal level with the world, and hope you'll join us in spreading love and learning to the globe.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We understand it may be hard to put faith into a project in today's world when so many people are quick to give up or burn bridges. However, we have formed a family within our unit and around our music that we have no interest in letting go. We are currently in our 5th year of Red Sage, and can promise there will be many more to come whether or not we hit our goal here.

My name is Heather Normandale, I've been a part of the Bay Area Folk fusion scene since 2007, developing a unique style of music weaving together elements of cinematic pop, gypsy jazz, blues, afropop guitar, india raga inspired vocals and the swamp grass folk of my Florida roots.

Miss Sarawan Band is comprised of U.K. guitarist Joe Wrigley, Finnish drummer Antti Siitonen, Russian bassist Andrey Mesheryakov, and Cambodian keyboardist Chea Sophal. For years now this top-notch group of globe-trotting musicians, brought together fortuitously by fickle fate here in Cambodia, have delighted audiences at live music venues, Khmer weddings, local music festivals, and many other celebrations around Cambodia, even reaching an international audience in 2017 with an appearance on the Netflix TV show ‘Jack Whitehall: Travels With My Father’.

Six of the best songs Miss Sarawan has written to date are bound together with Mealea’s romantic lyrical style and the signature 1960’s instrumental twang of Cambodia's ‘Golden Era’. ‘Sabay Jong Jam’ is a kooky mix of Vietnam-war era South-East-Asian cultural melting pot with elements of atmospheric ‘Spaghetti Western’ and ‘Americana’. Put another way, Miss Sarawan creates an undeniably cool and consciously retro sound, one which would not be out of place on the soundtrack to a movie by Quentin Tarantino or David Lynch!</p><p>With this recording, Miss Sarawan will be able to join her musical peers in Cambodia - bands such as the Cambodian Space Project and The Kampot Playboys - on the international stage. Having a well-produced and well-presented recording is an absolute must in order to play such events.

<h3>Thank you for being here! Here's wazzup.</h3>
<p>I began compiling the repertoire and working on these arrangements in 2015. After the Orlando shootings in 2016, Stevie Wonder's <i>Love's in Need of Love Today</i> came to mind, and I knew I had my concept for this recording: Love Needs Love. Since then, I've continued to fine-tune the songs, with the unwavering support of Roseanna Vitro, my friend and producer. Lee has been on-board from the beginning, devoting many hours in collaboration.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm a lifelong musician and composer. After 15 years in desktop publishing, I entered healing arts and metaphysical studies in 2005. I've practiced Quantum Energetics Structured Therapy since 2008, I am now an Akashic Records Guide, and still music director at Unitarian Universalist Congregation of the Palisades in Englewood, NJ</li>
<li>It seems like this is the perfect time for me to do this. I am now 65 years old. I've been developing the concept and repertoire for years. The world needs healing. We are one global race, and forgiveness will catalyze the freedom to peacefully live together and co-create new patterns of wholeness and wellness.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>The biggest ticket left is for promotion. National Press Campaign—$3K and National Radio Campaign—$3K</li>
<li>Licensing to compensate composers and lyricists—$1500</li>
<li>CD Duplication—$2K</li>
<li>Final mixing and mastering—$1500</li>
<li>Photos and packaging design—$1500 unless I do it myself, which is definitely a possibility.</li>
<li>You get the music, plus opportunities to be integral to my completion of a lifetime goal.There are options for T-shirts, professional musical arrangements in your key, healing sessions, house concerts.</li>
<li>I can eventually finish the recording, but having the resources to market it would help me reach an enormously greater audience. As a teenager I felt I owed a karmic debt to society, and this was part of my motivation toward music. My intention is to bring healing with these songs, promoting a message of love and compassion that supersedes all fear.</li>
<li>If I don't reach my entire goal, I will cut corners where necessary. I can design the packaging using photos from 2016. I can choose either press OR radio marketing. I can make fewer CDs. I will get this project out, one way or another.  Your contributions will all go toward this end.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I've invested about $12K to get this far. My vision is to become the ""Susan Boyle of Jazz"" making a big splash, airing on jazz radio, working in listening rooms where I can use my gifts to connect to an audience on a grander scale, promoting the wisdom that Love Changes Everything, and we all have it to give,and we are worthy of receiving it. Love can't be bought or sold, and is available in limitless supply. In order for me to do this on the level I envision, besides press and radio campaigns, I'd like to advertise in trade journals. The tracks we have are jewels, ready to be carved into the finest gems as the production is completed. This is truly an opportunity for you to help me to create a world-class recording. I have confidence that there is enough support for this dream of singing love into this world. Thank you for your help! Love Needs Love</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you have no money to contribute, please help by sharing this with your friends and family.  Sit in meditation and see yourself holding the CD cover in your hand, hearing it being played. Every  thing is energy, and your visionary energy helps! Thanks!</p>

<h3>Perks and Rewards</h3>
<p>There are a few </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Digital Download</strong> – For $10, you'll receive a download of the album after I've wrapped up the finishing touches, probably in early spring.</li>
<li>
<b>Song Charts and Commentary </b>– If you donate $15 or more, you'll also receive a PDF with song charts with instrument chords (so you can play along with guitar/piano etc).</li>
<li>
<strong>Early Access </strong>– For $20, you can get the rough cut of the album right away, and the PDF as soon as it's available. You'll also get periodic updates as I complete new versions of songs, and the opportunity to offer feedback. </li>
<li>
<b>Bonus and Instrumental Tracks</b> – Alternately, for $20 you can some bonus tracks – some fun and sillier songs, as well as instrumental versions of the songs so that you can use it to sing karaoke-style. (Downloadable in early spring of 2019)</li>
<li>
<b>All The Things! </b>– For $35 or more, you can receive all the above things as soon as I finish them up. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

<p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
<p>The Gunn High School Choir is a 150 voice choral ensemble from Palo Alto, CA. We embrace singing as a transformative experience that gives our high school students the vital purpose, community and harmony essential for their well-being.  </p>
<p>Equity is the fundamental principle of our Choir.  We offer international singing tours to all students, regardless of their families’ ability to pay the full cost.  This year’s tour is to Italy in June of 2019 where our singers will perform Mass at the Vatican, among other famous locations.  </p>
<p>We are committed to providing financial support to struggling families who want their children to have this once in a lifetime opportunity, but can’t possibly afford it.</p>
<p><strong>Our Need, Your Benefits</strong></p>
<p>Despite what you may read, there is real need in the Palo Alto Community.  This year we are raising $50,000 to support more than 20 teen singers whose families cannot afford the Italy trip.   While our Choir raises funds all year through our extensive Gunn Student/Staff Musical and by singing at Senior Centers, Kiwanis, Rotary Clubs and extensively during the holidays, we cannot reach our goal without your help, too.</p>
<p>We need an additional $20,000 in order to make the tour possible for every student.  This is where you come in.</p>
<p>Donors are listed in our beautiful programs, receive our undying gratitude and tickets to our shows and are even eligible (at the highest level) for a personalized concert by the Chambers Singers.</p>
<p><strong>Global Harmony</strong></p>
<p>While some high schools offer “non-school sanctioned” specialty trips that are costly and exclusive, our public schools need to be a place where there is equal opportunity for all. That’s what this scholarship fund and your generosity are helping to create.  Over the past 20 years, the Gunn Choir has toured destinations in Europe, Canada, Mexico, New York City and Disneyland, providing hundreds of families with financial support so their children can participate.

</div></div>","Who We Are
The Gunn High School Choir is a 150 voice choral ensemble from Palo Alto, CA. We embrace singing as a transformative experience that gives our high school students the vital purpose, community and harmony essential for their well-being.  
Equity is the fundamental principle of our Choir.  We offer international singing tours to all students, regardless of their families’ ability to pay the full cost.  This year’s tour is to Italy in June of 2019 where our singers will perform Mass at the Vatican, among other famous locations.  
We are committed to providing financial support to struggling families who want their children to have this once in a lifetime opportunity, but can’t possibly afford it.
Our Need, Your Benefits
Despite what you may read, there is real need in the Palo Alto Community.  This year we are raising $50,000 to support more than 20 teen singers whose families cannot afford the Italy trip.   While our Choir raises funds all year through our extensive Gunn Student/Staff Musical and by singing at Senior Centers, Kiwanis, Rotary Clubs and extensively during the holidays, we cannot reach our goal without your help, too.
We need an additional $20,000 in order to make the tour possible for every student.  This is where you come in.
Donors are listed in our beautiful programs, receive our undying gratitude and tickets to our shows and are even eligible (at the highest level) for a personalized concert by the Chambers Singers.
Global Harmony
While some high schools offer “non-school sanctioned” specialty trips that are costly and exclusive, our public schools need to be a place where there is equal opportunity for all. That’s what this scholarship fund and your generosity are helping to create.  Over the past 20 years, the Gunn Choir has toured destinations in Europe, Canada, Mexico, New York City and Disneyland, providing hundreds of families with financial support so their children can participate. Students return saying their tour experience was life changing - possibly the most incredible experience of their high school years.
Beyond what the students themselves gain from the experience, we believe there is a greater good.  By sharing the joy of music on a global scale, our students become the best kind of ambassadors for a more harmonious world.
So please….give to our fundraising campaign at whatever level you can afford.  Our public schools play a role in sharing the arts between cultures, in blending our voices with others, and in giving each student a chance to experience the power of voice on a global scale.
Our world needs all the harmony it can get, and that’s what this scholarship fund and your generosity are helping to create.

<h3>How YOU can help :)</h3>
<p>We all have dreams and aspirations.  Sometimes we wish ours were less demanding.  We don't know if what we are doing is the right thing, or the smart thing...but we do know that if we hadn't ever tried...we'd regret it at some point in life. </p>
<p>We honestly didn't expect it to be so much work and dedication, but we love it.  While the first tour was successful, we were able to sustain ourselves and eat every night, while buying gas and paying bills...we are stepping it up a notch.  Here are just a few things that we need in order to make a tour and career as a musician work:</p>
<p>-New Produced Music<br/>-Packaging, licensing, and publishing that music<br/>-Show Merch (t-shirts, stickers, pins, etc.)<br/>-Music Videos<br/>-Tour promotion (ads, flyers, cards, etc.)<br/>-Subscriptions to websites for booking<br/>-Constant gear and vehicle maintenance/upkeep</p>
<p>And then some.  This all costs us our own dollars and lots of time, which we love to put in as much as we can.  The more funds we have, the better chance we have at being successful while touring, and the longer we get to keep going at this dream of ours.  I'm currently working on the 2nd EP that I will be releasing before the tour starts in March.  We still haven't gotten physical copies of the first EP made, still yet have to get t-shirts, and now a 2nd EP is on the way.  Your contributions will help with all of these things.  And the best part, we want to give back to you for taking part in our dreams!  Here are a few of the awards we would like to offer :)</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We all can appreciate and love music in some way.  There is no better feeling in the world than playing a song and having someone come up just to tell you how it has touched them, or relates to something in their life.  We want to share our stories, our passions, our fears, trials, heartaches, love, happiness and dreams with you through song.  We want to play in your town.  We want to spread the music across the nation, and maybe even the world.  Your contributions allow that to become real for us.  We are doing this the right way, and being very efficient and effective with our time, and money.  We want to make this work and promise to keep you all updated along the way while putting your donations to good use. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Life on the road, as a musician has tons of risks.  Most nights we aren't sure where we will be sleeping as we stay in our van to save money...but we love it!  There is ALWAYS the threat of traffic, car accidents, vehicle break downs or tire blow outs, etc.  Also eating healthy and taking care of ourselves can be a challenge out there.  Another big one is the fact that we've given up health insurance, steady pay, and comfort in our lives.  If we get sick on the road (which I have...food poisoning)...it can be miserable.</p>
<p>Time is always a challenge as well.  Trying to always get music out and in front of people is tough with all of the competition these days.  We can't just turn off life and lock ourselves in the studio forever...we have to still play shows every week to pay bills, even during our ""down"" time.  We work 7 days a week doing something typically.  This can take a toll on a relationship, so being a husband and wife duo in our first year of marriage, this can be challenging to find the balance between work and play.  But we are learning and figuring it out along the way!<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Thanks for getting this far!  Phew...it's a long one.  We want you to know that donating is not the only way we could use your help.  If you like the music and what we are doing, then simply go and follow ""Seth Brand"" on spotify, iTunes, etc.  Like my facebook page (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sethbrandmusic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Seth Brand Music</a> and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sethbrand"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Seth Brand</a>), Instagram (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sethbrandmusic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Seth Brand Music</a>), YouTube (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/sethbrandmusic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Seth Brand Music</a>), etc.  Follow our website (<a href=""http://www.sethbrand.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sethbrand.com</a> ; <a href=""https://ssbrand.wixsite.com/abrandnewadventure"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://ssbrand.wixsite.com/abrandnewadventure</a>) and stay up to date with our blog which we plan to do while on this tour. </p>

<p><strong>Lakhushd</strong>i is a unique village in the upper Svaneti region of Georgia. Blessed by its stunning physical beauty, the village is also remarkable because of the ancient traditions and culture it has maintained throughout the centuries. It can be said that Lakhushdi is a living museum of Svan life. Old traditional <strong>Svan folk music</strong> still exists in Lakhushdi in the context of its original environment, which is an increasingly rare phenomenon in today's world. Understandably, our village has become quite popular nowadays among foreign visitors who are interested in Georgian folk singing. Their main focus is the music, but the experience of hearing this music sung by the village singers while participating in the village’s traditional everyday life, has added a special dimension to Lakhushdi's appeal.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593521940/y5i2fcubbgctpl8nw6iy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Lakhushdi is a “bio village” with respect to ethnomusicology, a place where this ""bio music"" is alive and well.</p>
<p>Our <strong>Chamgeliani</strong> family is a singing family. The tradition has been <strong>passed from generation to generation</strong>, always playing a prominent role in the cultural life of the village. But the time came when we felt the need to introduce Lakhushdi to the rest of the world. This calculated exposure had two main goals: to save our cultural treasure from gradually disappearing, and to improve the economic situation of the village so that its inhabitants could afford to maintain this living tradition. So in 2011, with help from our foreign friends, an idea was born - to invite select visitors to experience our culture and traditions, at the same time preserving and adapting them to the modern world. Lakhushdi has been called a singing village. Our project is unusual in the fact that <strong>we do not relate to our guests as tourists;</strong> we deliberately use the word <strong>“guest”</strong> instead of “tourist”. We believe that “a guest is a gift from God,” and we treat them as members of our family, our village, our community. Our guests are <strong>fully integrated</strong> into the life of the host family and the village, participating in religious and folklore festivals. Joining in the farming chores they hoe, plow, weed, and make cheese. They sing, dance, pray, and play with the children. At night we assemble around a bonfire or perform joint concerts on the impromptu stage, where a considerable audience may gather. We tell our guests folktales and myths about Svaneti, and these magical evenings create meaningful impressions for guests and hosts alike. The village youngsters, growing up in an era of globalization, have the rare opportunity to suddenly perceive their own culture and traditions in a completely new light.</p>

<p>Despite our efforts, many traditional Svaneti handicrafts have been lost or are on the verge of extinction. One feels<strong> the need for a communal space </strong>where we might revive the transmission of artisans' knowledge of all kinds, <strong>a cultural centre</strong> where members of the younger generation can learn local handicrafts. A space where special events can be presented, as well as a regular daily exchange of traditional know-how. It was thus decided, as the next step for Lakhushdi, to build a <strong>""House of Song""</strong>. This will only be possible with help from our friends around the globe, and we hope this house will become a home for all that we cherish, for all that our guests have also come to recognize as good and wholesome and valuable.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Greetings and Salutations!</p>
<p>My name is Mikhail Johnson, an international student from Jamaica, who is currently a Doctoral Candidate in Piano Performance at Texas Tech University.</p>
<p>I am also a freelance pianist and composer in the early stages of my career and this campaign is soliciting your assistance of sixteen thousand dollars ($16,000) to cover my expenses of tuition, room and board for my final year of graduate school.</p>
<p>In recent months the global pandemic has greatly affected my ability to support myself as an artist; halting all streams of income. Additionally, due to organizational budget cuts, my scholarships were reduced by 50%. The onset of the pandemic was quite untimely and as an international student, many privileges afforded to citizens to obtain work/income are extremely limited to foreigners and require extreme planning and paperwork to obtain permission.</p>
<p>Your generous contribution will not only facilitate completion of my degree, but will contribute to several artistic cultural projects of mine that were meant to provide funds to cover my living expenses.</p>
</div><div><h3>The Goal</h3></div><div>
<p>I need sixteen thousand dollars ($16,000) by May 31, 2021 to cover my college tuition and my living expenses (rent and food) for the entire school year. The breakdown is as follows:</p>
<p>$10,000- School tuition and fees</p>
<p>$6,000- Living expenses (rent, food, living essentials)</p>
<p>Your contributions based on your choice will give you exclusive perks such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exclusive performances of me</li>
<li>Virtual recital links</li>
<li>Be named as a Patron of Mikhail as a Performer, Composer, or Publisher (Johno Muzik) on the dedicated Support page on my official website: <a href=""http://mikhail2406.wix.com/mikhail-johnson"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://mikhail2406.wix.com/mikhail-johnson</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, your contribution will aid in the creation of new Jamaican musical compositions for the following forces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voice and Piano</li>
<li>Violin and Piano</li>
<li>Two Keyboard Instruments</li>
<li>Brass Quintet</li>
<li>Brass Ensemble</li>
<li>Orchestra  </li>
</ul>
<p>Your name will be in the actual sheet music as a Commissioner. You will also receive exclusive recordings of the piece you chose once the work had been completed and performed/ recorded.  </p>
<p>If we do not make the entire goal, all your contributions will go towards meeting the tuition goal first to ensure completion of the degree in the stipulated time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Possible Challenges</h3>

</div></div>","Summary
Greetings and Salutations!
My name is Mikhail Johnson, an international student from Jamaica, who is currently a Doctoral Candidate in Piano Performance at Texas Tech University.
I am also a freelance pianist and composer in the early stages of my career and this campaign is soliciting your assistance of sixteen thousand dollars ($16,000) to cover my expenses of tuition, room and board for my final year of graduate school.
In recent months the global pandemic has greatly affected my ability to support myself as an artist; halting all streams of income. Additionally, due to organizational budget cuts, my scholarships were reduced by 50%. The onset of the pandemic was quite untimely and as an international student, many privileges afforded to citizens to obtain work/income are extremely limited to foreigners and require extreme planning and paperwork to obtain permission.
Your generous contribution will not only facilitate completion of my degree, but will contribute to several artistic cultural projects of mine that were meant to provide funds to cover my living expenses.
The Goal
I need sixteen thousand dollars ($16,000) by May 31, 2021 to cover my college tuition and my living expenses (rent and food) for the entire school year. The breakdown is as follows:
$10,000- School tuition and fees
$6,000- Living expenses (rent, food, living essentials)
Your contributions based on your choice will give you exclusive perks such as:

Exclusive performances of me
Virtual recital links
Be named as a Patron of Mikhail as a Performer, Composer, or Publisher (Johno Muzik) on the dedicated Support page on my official website: http://mikhail2406.wix.com/mikhail-johnson


Furthermore, your contribution will aid in the creation of new Jamaican musical compositions for the following forces:

Voice and Piano
Violin and Piano
Two Keyboard Instruments
Brass Quintet
Brass Ensemble
Orchestra  

Your name will be in the actual sheet music as a Commissioner. You will also receive exclusive recordings of the piece you chose once the work had been completed and performed/ recorded.  
If we do not make the entire goal, all your contributions will go towards meeting the tuition goal first to ensure completion of the degree in the stipulated time.

Possible Challenges
It is important that I address possible challenges that I will face relating to the commissioned perks presented as well as the performance perks.
Given the pandemic climate, performing has become a very arduous task. Booking venues (especially with social distancing protocols) will take longer planning times than before the pandemic and this will be the case for a while. As such, coordination to get the performers to rehearse, perform and/or record within stipulated guidelines, the recordings of my compositions or performance recitals may not take place as quickly as before.
Nevertheless, rest assure that you will be the first to notified of all perks as they arrive.

Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you are not able to contribute to this campaign currently, please by all means share far and wide with anyone who could help or might be interested in supporting my cause. 
Feel free to utilize the Indigogo sharing features.
Thank you so much for your time and consideration. I am greatly appreciative of your support.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I have been living in Berlin for the last 4 years during which I have studied vocals (BA) and had the opportunity to work as a backing vocalist and violinist in different projects. Inspired by the artists I have worked with I found the songwriter in me. Check out a <a href=""https://youtu.be/J7nUxvEKIVY?t=305"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">concert</a> I streamed from a beautiful Zionskirche, Berlin last December. <br/><br/><strong>What?</strong><br/><br/>So far I have been performing my music only live mostly solo. The next step of growth is to bring four of my songs alive with bigger string and band arrangements at the studio! </p><p>The songs are written by me and the arrangements done together with the amazing musicians Dan, Andrius, Victor and Hannah, you'll also hear them on the songs. We will record at Blue Whale Studio in Wedding, Berlin. The tape recording Blue Whale uses gives the perfect live sound feel to the music. After choosing the best takes Emilio (the trusted, insanely talented sound engineer of Blue Whale) will mix and afterwards send the songs to his entrusted mastering engineer Facu in Argentina.<br/><br/><strong>How?</strong><br/><br/>The recording process involves a lot of steps from arrangements, the sound, visual and promotion details to the finished recordings and releases. This takes time which also means money. Here's an overview of how your money will be used in this project:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625131859/mpazmebzzhmyvge6ocp2.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Here's a bit more about each section:</p><ul>

If you would still like to make a contribution, please send an inquiry to colbert.jeremy@gmail.com **</p><p><strong>Jeremy Colbert</strong> is a musician and educator living in Pittsburgh, PA with a strong interest in the impact music has on our consciousness. During his 16 years as a songwriter he has explored the depths of how lyrics and music relate to and affect the human psyche. Holding a degree in music education, he has seen firsthand how music positively shapes the character of youth during his 10+ years of teaching. As a music-lover, he has seen countless times the therapeutic communal effect live music has on the listeners—especially to those who move and dance to the music.</p><h2>Spirit Maze Campaign</h2><ul>
<li>Original music rooted in the healing and reflective power of music</li>
<li>Featuring Terrapan (handpan—inverted steel drum) and guitar/vocal compositions</li>
<li>Tuned to a frequency believed to be in alignment with the natural world (432Hz)</li>
<li>Recorded in Boulder with Dango Rose of Elephant Revival and Evan Reeves as producers</li>
<li>Featuring string arrangements, musicians Bridget Law &amp; Darren Garvey of Elephant Revival, Richard Vagner &amp; others</li>
<li>Self-funded so far and completely recorded, final push to complete and launch</li>
<li>Donations will go directly and efficiently toward final production costs, mixing, mastering, hiring an artist, creating a website, and marketing the album</li>
<li>If you donate, a digital copy of the album will be sent to you upon its launch</li>
<li>Pledge to play community and charity events for each fundraising benchmark</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>$10,800 may seem like an odd goal. In many cultures the number 108 is considered to be quite significant (you can read more below). The intrinsic power of mathematics and sacred geometry is truly fascinating and this album is imbued with traces of these principals (for example, the second track “Align” is based around the tempo of 108 beats per minute).  </p><p><strong>Jeremy is pledging to commit to playing a community or charity event each time this campaign raises $1080 up until $10800</strong>. For instance, playing music at Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, accompanying a community yoga class, providing background music for a charity event, or sharing the Terrapan at a retirement home. These will be announced and whenever appropriate they will be live-streamed on Facebook.</p><p>The benchmark totals are as follows:</p><ol>
<li>$1080 *reached!* MAPS conference in Wilkinsburg during SOAP on 9/28</li>
<li>$2160 *reached!* Repair the World: Pittsburgh - future community event! </li>
<li>$3240 *reached!* Stand by for announcement!</li>
<li>$4320 *reached!* Stand by for announcement! </li>

</ol><h2>The Journey and Story</h2><p>In 2014 Jeremy was introduced to the Terrapan (one type of handpan) by the talented <a href=""https://youtu.be/6oremFnbgO0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sam Maher</a> and acquired one soon thereafter. After working with plant medicines in Peru, Jeremy was compelled to change his framework around music and began exploring the meditative and healing potential of this incredible instrument as well as 432Hz tuning (more info on that below). Soon he was writing compositions with his new instrument and sharing it with curious listeners who were asking about his entrancing ‘space-ship turtle-shell.’</p><h3>Intentions behind the Music</h3><p>This album contains seven tracks that are intended to take the listener on an expansive &amp; reflective journey. Instrumental Terrapan compositions--layered with ethereal string arrangements—are weaved into fully produced guitar and vocal works that share musings of consciousness, alignment, connection, and healing—both collective in regard to the state of our planet and individual in regard to the internal evolutions we are all experiencing.</p><h3>The Terrapan</h3><p>The inverted steel drum that we call a ‘handpan’ originated in Switzerland in the year 2000 and was called the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_(instrument)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hang</a> (pronounced ‘hawng’) created by the company <a href=""https://panart.ch/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PANArt</a>. Today there are many makers who model after the original. Jeremy plays a Terrapan made by <a href=""https://www.terratonz.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Terratonz</a> that is tuned to F major 432Hz (specifically ‘Tinggi Pelog’ tuning). Jeremy has used this instrument as a personal meditative tool to compose music that embodies a feeling or impactful experience in his life. The music has been shared in many ways including accompanying yoga classes, as a means of sound healing and space-holding, performing (both on stage and sharing during ceremonies such as the September 19' Full Moon Gathering at Alex &amp; Allyson Grey's <a href=""https://www.cosm.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chapel of Sacred Mirrors</a>), and in artistic endeavors—namely an immersive collaboration with <a href=""https://www.bricolagepgh.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bricolage Theater Company</a>. Spirit Maze will be the first time the music is shared via collaborative professional studio recordings.</p><h3>Why Boulder?</h3><p>Jeremy, a Pittsburgh musician, chose to record in Boulder for reasons beyond his love of mountains, the region, and its people. Many musicians he admires are based in the area, including the band <a href=""http://www.elephantrevival.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Elephant Revival</a> that spent 11 years creating and spreading gorgeous consciously-minded folk music. <a href=""http://dangorose.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dango Rose,</a> who plays bass and mandolin with the group, recently formed the artist agency <a href=""https://www.elephantcollective.agency"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Elephant Collective</a> along with talented producer Evan Reeves—who has ties to Pittsburgh. After connecting with Dango on the phone and meeting up with Evan (while he was in Pittsburgh visiting family) it became clear that a collaborative studio effort was in the works and Jeremy was invited to Boulder to get started. The vision of creating a unique meditative and reflective album was immediately supported, even down to working in a different standard of tuning—432Hz.</p><h3>What does 432Hz music mean?</h3><p>Over the centuries, instruments in the Western model of music have been tuned based on the relative pitch of a note we call ‘A’ above middle C. The amount of times this note vibrates per second is its Hertz (Hz) value. In 1955 it was established that the international standard of music would use 440Hz (440 times per second) as the reference pitch to tune the ‘A’ note. There is a large school of thought that suggests this standard ought to be just slightly lower (honestly almost imperceivable to an untrained ear) and based around 432Hz. Mathematically, tuning this way creates middle C to be a perfect 256Hz (as opposed to 261.656Hz) and there are other more intricate ways in which the math lends itself in favor of 432Hz.</p><p>The verdict is, of course, still out. Please do your own research and experience the difference for yourself. It may feel a little odd at first listening to 432Hz music because we are so used to 440Hz, but from my experience over the last 4 years I have grown to love the warmth and connection that I experience from this tuning (and I love singing to it!).</p><p>A more in-depth yet straight-forward explanation can be explored here: <a href=""https://www.binauralbeatsmeditation.com/432-hz-truth-behind-natures-frequency/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.binauralbeatsmeditation.com/432-hz-truth-behind-natures-frequency/</a></p><p>If you want to dive deeper, a brilliant modern mathematician <a href=""https://www.robertedwardgrant.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Robert Edward Grant</a> has made some interesting mathematical discoveries and the following video is a peek into how mathematical constants support 432Hz tuning:</p><p><a href=""https://youtu.be/_619nwr409o"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://youtu.be/_619nwr409o</a></p><p>It is, of course, wonderful to have standards so that musicians and instruments all around the world can perform together. In my opinion, 440Hz music can absolutely be healing, however it has been my intention to explore firsthand and experientially how tuning to 432Hz feels in the body and how it affects the mental state. All I can say is my experience has proven quite positive in regard to 432Hz music.</p><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cymatics"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Cymatics</strong></a> is the study of wave phenomena. Visually, sound waves manifest in fascinating and consistent ways in the surface of water, or when salt or sand is vibrated on metal surfaces. Feel free to view the following video to see how sound takes shape with cymatics and to see how, in one case, it varies from 432Hz to 440Hz. Please note that this is just one example and there are factors such as surface material and size that may come into play. Regardless, it is fascinating to see how sound takes shape!</p><p><a href=""https://youtu.be/1zw0uWCNsyw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://youtu.be/1zw0uWCNsyw</a></p><p>All of this is an exploration. Please, feel welcome to join me! What I’ve found is that many things considered to be the norm are not always in alignment and that there is value in venturing outside the box.</p><h3>The significance of 108</h3><p>108 is considered by many cultures (largely Hindu, Buddhist, and yogic) to be a sacred number. My favorite aspect of the number is as follows:</p><p><strong>1</strong> represents the linear, how we perceive time and the progression of our lives</p><p><strong>0</strong> represents the circle, the cycle—the experiences/seasons that come around again and again</p><p><strong>8</strong> represents infinity—fractal truth</p><p>Here are a few examples of the significance of 108:</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568389212/zspa0pcmragkxn6t0cnz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><ul>

Self-funded so far and completely recorded, final push to complete and launch
Donations will go directly and efficiently toward final production costs, mixing, mastering, hiring an artist, creating a website, and marketing the album
If you donate, a digital copy of the album will be sent to you upon its launch
Pledge to play community and charity events for each fundraising benchmark
 $10,800 may seem like an odd goal. In many cultures the number 108 is considered to be quite significant (you can read more below). The intrinsic power of mathematics and sacred geometry is truly fascinating and this album is imbued with traces of these principals (for example, the second track “Align” is based around the tempo of 108 beats per minute).  Jeremy is pledging to commit to playing a community or charity event each time this campaign raises $1080 up until $10800. For instance, playing music at Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, accompanying a community yoga class, providing background music for a charity event, or sharing the Terrapan at a retirement home. These will be announced and whenever appropriate they will be live-streamed on Facebook.The benchmark totals are as follows:
$1080 *reached!* MAPS conference in Wilkinsburg during SOAP on 9/28

The Journey and StoryIn 2014 Jeremy was introduced to the Terrapan (one type of handpan) by the talented Sam Maher and acquired one soon thereafter. After working with plant medicines in Peru, Jeremy was compelled to change his framework around music and began exploring the meditative and healing potential of this incredible instrument as well as 432Hz tuning (more info on that below). Soon he was writing compositions with his new instrument and sharing it with curious listeners who were asking about his entrancing ‘space-ship turtle-shell.’Intentions behind the MusicThis album contains seven tracks that are intended to take the listener on an expansive & reflective journey. Instrumental Terrapan compositions--layered with ethereal string arrangements—are weaved into fully produced guitar and vocal works that share musings of consciousness, alignment, connection, and healing—both collective in regard to the state of our planet and individual in regard to the internal evolutions we are all experiencing.The TerrapanThe inverted steel drum that we call a ‘handpan’ originated in Switzerland in the year 2000 and was called the Hang (pronounced ‘hawng’) created by the company PANArt. Today there are many makers who model after the original. Jeremy plays a Terrapan made by Terratonz that is tuned to F major 432Hz (specifically ‘Tinggi Pelog’ tuning). Jeremy has used this instrument as a personal meditative tool to compose music that embodies a feeling or impactful experience in his life. The music has been shared in many ways including accompanying yoga classes, as a means of sound healing and space-holding, performing (both on stage and sharing during ceremonies such as the September 19' Full Moon Gathering at Alex & Allyson Grey's Chapel of Sacred Mirrors), and in artistic endeavors—namely an immersive collaboration with Bricolage Theater Company. Spirit Maze will be the first time the music is shared via collaborative professional studio recordings.Why Boulder?Jeremy, a Pittsburgh musician, chose to record in Boulder for reasons beyond his love of mountains, the region, and its people. Many musicians he admires are based in the area, including the band Elephant Revival that spent 11 years creating and spreading gorgeous consciously-minded folk music. Dango Rose, who plays bass and mandolin with the group, recently formed the artist agency Elephant Collective along with talented producer Evan Reeves—who has ties to Pittsburgh. After connecting with Dango on the phone and meeting up with Evan (while he was in Pittsburgh visiting family) it became clear that a collaborative studio effort was in the works and Jeremy was invited to Boulder to get started. The vision of creating a unique meditative and reflective album was immediately supported, even down to working in a different standard of tuning—432Hz.What does 432Hz music mean?Over the centuries, instruments in the Western model of music have been tuned based on the relative pitch of a note we call ‘A’ above middle C. The amount of times this note vibrates per second is its Hertz (Hz) value. In 1955 it was established that the international standard of music would use 440Hz (440 times per second) as the reference pitch to tune the ‘A’ note. There is a large school of thought that suggests this standard ought to be just slightly lower (honestly almost imperceivable to an untrained ear) and based around 432Hz. Mathematically, tuning this way creates middle C to be a perfect 256Hz (as opposed to 261.656Hz) and there are other more intricate ways in which the math lends itself in favor of 432Hz.The verdict is, of course, still out. Please do your own research and experience the difference for yourself. It may feel a little odd at first listening to 432Hz music because we are so used to 440Hz, but from my experience over the last 4 years I have grown to love the warmth and connection that I experience from this tuning (and I love singing to it!).A more in-depth yet straight-forward explanation can be explored here: https://www.binauralbeatsmeditation.com/432-hz-truth-behind-natures-frequency/If you want to dive deeper, a brilliant modern mathematician Robert Edward Grant has made some interesting mathematical discoveries and the following video is a peek into how mathematical constants support 432Hz tuning:https://youtu.be/_619nwr409oIt is, of course, wonderful to have standards so that musicians and instruments all around the world can perform together. In my opinion, 440Hz music can absolutely be healing, however it has been my intention to explore firsthand and experientially how tuning to 432Hz feels in the body and how it affects the mental state. All I can say is my experience has proven quite positive in regard to 432Hz music.Cymatics is the study of wave phenomena. Visually, sound waves manifest in fascinating and consistent ways in the surface of water, or when salt or sand is vibrated on metal surfaces. Feel free to view the following video to see how sound takes shape with cymatics and to see how, in one case, it varies from 432Hz to 440Hz. Please note that this is just one example and there are factors such as surface material and size that may come into play. Regardless, it is fascinating to see how sound takes shape!https://youtu.be/1zw0uWCNsywAll of this is an exploration. Please, feel welcome to join me! What I’ve found is that many things considered to be the norm are not always in alignment and that there is value in venturing outside the box.The significance of 108108 is considered by many cultures (largely Hindu, Buddhist, and yogic) to be a sacred number. My favorite aspect of the number is as follows:1 represents the linear, how we perceive time and the progression of our lives0 represents the circle, the cycle—the experiences/seasons that come around again and again8 represents infinity—fractal truthHere are a few examples of the significance of 108:
The 5-pointed star (that aligns with the human form, and is used in fractal form as a symbol of this album) contains the angle of 108 degrees five times within its central pentagon and on the outer degrees.
Mala prayer beads almost always contain 108 beads and many yogic traditions and sacred sites are based around the number 108 (ie 108 energy lines, or Nadis, in the body, 108 Sun salutation practice, 108 Earthly desires)
At 432Hz tuning, one octave of A (as in the open low A of the 5th guitar string) vibrates at 108Hz
The moon’s diameter is around 1080 miles
In astrology there are 9 planets and 12 houses, which make 108 combinations
The Sanskrit alphabet also has 54 letters, each having masculine and feminine quality for a total of 108
The Sri Yantra, a sacred geometric symbol of creation, contains 54 points where three lines intersect, and each of these points has a masculine and feminine quality—making 108
  What is the Symbol? The symbol that you see featured is a concept that Jeremy came up with that overlays two very powerful symbols.The Pythagorean Lute (or Lute of Pythagoras) is a fractal (shape that continues infinitely in both directions) 5-pointed star that overlaps upon itself that was presented very clearly to Jeremy during a vision while in Peru. The Caduceus (dual serpent with wings) is something we are all familiar with, as it is commonly used as our medical symbol.However, this association was a mistake that occurred most notably by the US Army Medical Corps in 1902 when the Caduceus was used as its logo. The symbol that is supposed to be associated with medicine is a similar one called the Rod of Asclepius that only has one snake and no wings (as used correctly by Blue Cross Blue Shield).Ironically, the Caduceus, also known as the Staff of Hermes, has historically been a symbol of commerce. It is interesting that over the last century our culture has used the Staff of Hermes as the symbol for our 'booming' medical industry.Spiritually, the Caduceus symbol represents the alchemy of masculine and feminine energies rising and intertwining as a means for growth or enlightenment (wings), as widely portrayed in Kundalini Energy.The way that these two symbols (Pythagorean Lute and Caduceus) overlay perfectly struck Jeremy as significant, and he teamed up with James Gyre of Naked Geometry  to hone in on the union and create laser-cut art pieces, both small scale and large, to create the symbol that is the Spirit Maze—a portrayal of the sacred fractal experience of growth that we are all on. Thank you for taking the time to read!

<h3>About Allen...</h3>
<p><br/>Allen is a poet / writer / Jazz vocalist<br/><br/>As a singer Allen (me) has been described as being warm, with a conversational style, with critics praising his ability to not only sound as if he believes every word that he interprets but an approach that communicates very well to audiences.  I was born in Newark, New Jersey, but for some time, has been based in London.  I made my recording debut in 2017 with '<i>Sorry Grateful</i>', a collection of standards.  Among its highlights are my personal versions of <i>Misty, The Shadow Of Your Smile</i>, <i>Happiness Is A Thing Called Joe</i> and <i>When I Fall In Love</i>.  While I have (according to the critics) become an important part of the London music scene, my latest release, '<i>No One Is Alone</i>', has spread the news about my musical talents worldwide - reaching #98 on the Jazz USA billboards - and has led to an important step forward in realising my next project - <i>Uncovered Covers</i>.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>     Hi! Thank you so much for checking out my Indiegogo campaign! I am so excited to announce I am recording a NEW ALBUM! </p>
<p>     Last year was a year of intense change for a lot of us. For me it was a year of professional AND personal transformation. After living in New York City for 15 years I decided to make the life changing decision to move back to my home town of Johnson City, TN. This was a decision that I knew deep down was the right one, but it didn't come easy. I moved to New York over a decade ago because of the opportunities I believed it would offer me as an aspiring artist. From the minute I landed in the city of dreams I knew I was at home. It was serendipitous how quickly everything fell into place for me. As the years past, my love continued to grow for the city and it ultimately led me to the places and the people that inspired me to start my career as a singer-songwriter. </p>
<p>     After so many years of learning and growing, it became clear that it was time for me to move on and get back to my roots and be closer to my family. To be honest, I was apprehensive about coming back ""home.""  After all, it hadn't felt like my home in 20 years. I was nervous about establishing myself as an artist in a new town. Johnson City took me by surprise and superseded any expectations I could have imagined.  Coming back to Johnson City and introducing myself to the artist community was like walking into a room full of strangers with arms wide open ready to embrace me.  I am still overwhelmed with gratitude by the love and support I have received in less than a year of living here. </p>
<p>     That brings me to why I am wanting to record a new record. During the shutdown, I was unable to stay on the move like I had been used to, touring almost full time.  So, I took the time to get still and started writing again.  The songs came flowing like they had just been waiting in line ready for me to welcome them in. The previous year was full of so much experience, love and let down, and you can expect to hear about the ups and downs of my journey on this record.  For example, ""Solid Ground"" is a powerful song about finding my grounding again after a tumultuous relationship.  There is also a song titled ""Family"" where I sing about my journey coming back home and realizing my biggest fans have been here all along. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>     I have set my goal at $6,000, and this will help me get started with a few songs.  I am committed to start bringing these songs to life and I know we can do it! If we are able to reach this goal, my ultimate stretch goal will be $10,000 so that I can record my DEBUT FULL LENGTH ALBUM! </p>
<p>    By contributing to this campaign you will be helping me record with my dear friend and very talented producer, Matt Smile at his studio, Audioasis in Bristol, TN. I had the opportunity to work with Matt on my last single ""Sunshine."" I knew from the first day of working together that I wanted to do my album with him. We have incredible collaborative work energy and I can't wait to hear how he will help bring these songs to life.  </p>
<p>   Your contribution will also go towards hiring musicians, mixing, mastering &amp; artwork. </p>
<p>   By joining this journey you can expect to be invited to join a private Facebook group where I will share exclusive behind the scenes footage and updates on what its like recording an album with yours truly. There are also some other fun incentives over in the perks section you can check out.  </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>     For those of you who know me well, you know how much of an influence my family and my life experiences have on my songwriting. You also know how special it is for me to be close to my family again. It feels like the right place, right time and I truly believe these songs will have an emotional impact on those who decided to listen. Like all the feels :) </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The only risk I can see is the risk of putting myself out there again and telling my story, which is always a bit scary. But I know my fears at this point and I consider them to be my friend. </p>
<p>As for challenges- with the present state of the world and the unknown that lies ahead, I am sure that challenges will arise. But I don't feel inclined to focus on challenge because I don't mind challenge. I also don't mind ease and I believe with my whole heart this is going to unfold in the most perfect way.   </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>For those of you who can not make a financial contribution, I completely understand and I appreciate that you've even read this far. That to me says you're a contributor. You've already contributed your time and energy, and that means something. If you'd like to do more, please feel free to share this campaign!

<p><b><u>MY PURPOSE</u></b></p>
<p>It's been nearly 10 years since I first stepped foot in
Nashville, and now, here I stand on the cusp of seeing my sophomore album,
""Music Box,"" produced with the help from my friend, percussionist and
business partner, Pino Squillace, come to fruition.  It's been an experience growing as an artist
through many songs, countries, cities and towns. I keep going back to this
dream, though.</p>
<p>Thirteen years ago my soul found purpose, fueled by my
awakening inside a dream. Vividly before
me appeared three water-filled orbs.  To
my left, drowning in despair lay a crippled orchestra with no air to flow
through their reeds and strings.  Nobody
would ever be able to hear the voices of their instruments raised in harmony. Similarly in distress, the orb in the middle
and to the right beckoned me closer.  The
middle orb, full of dancers of all kinds, could not gain footing to display the
beauty blooming in their steps, just as the artists and painters in the right
orb could not reflect their colorful brush strokes because no canvas would hold
the art flowing out of them.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">They all looked as though they were crying out to be seen,
to be heard and I felt the sorrow inside the souls.  With a loving heart, I intuitively understood
something suddenly; that this water the orbs held symbolized the barrier
society brings to the true artist. Instinctively, I wanted to act, to help and
with that realization I found myself hoisted up on a podium with baton in hand;
the curator with the cure.  Like
lightning strikes from the ground, I was thrashing into the orbs, releasing the
artists from the confines of the water.</span></p>
<p>A sweet victory filled my heart and as the water flowed freely,
my song, ""Music Box,"" was born!</p>
<p>I want to embark on a crusade that will fight against the
obstacles that we as artists constantly face in today's society. Wouldn't it be
great to be free?  To let your heart
speak what it will into your art? To escape from them, the creatives you know,
the barriers holding back their art inspired by love, hate, disappointment,
celebrations, laughter, tears, hope, despair, truth and lies? Wouldn't that be
cause to link arms and fly the flags for artistic freedom?  Allow us to hold onto our inherent gifts, our
true purpose, and our artistic integrity. Will you believe in us?  Please, I invite you to join my cause.</p>
<p>I feel this
conviction to reach out to my fellow artists everywhere I go, to help them grow
as artists and individuals.</p>
<p><b><u>BUT I NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE…</u></b></p>
<p>The money I'm raising in this campaign will be going to very specific areas to help enable us to reach more people through music. I
have decided to list the different areas I'm raising money for, so you will
know each item your contributions will go toward.</p>

<h3>Why a Salon?</h3>
<p>A Music Salon gives each listener the highest value experience possible. It presents Artists and Public with the greatest degree of comfort and contact, while preserving the integrity and quality of the music. It perfectly suits all styles, from Baroque and Classical through Jazz and Country right up to Contemporary works and Improvisation. No wonder, then, that personalities like Beethoven, Schubert, Liszt, Chopin, and Brahms all composed the majority of their works for Salon concerts.</p>
<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>The Nuremberg Salon Project wants to share the high-quality live experience of chamber music with a broad public. No matter the musical style or time period, we want it to be personal and up close. Through the classic Salon format of our concerts, a variety of outreach projects, special events for new audiences, and a luxurious setting with pristine acoustics, we hope to promote the cultural welfare of our city’s downtown area.</p>
<h3>A Global Concept</h3>
<p>We want to bring the Salon experience back. More than that, we want to make it contemporary. We're starting in Nuremberg, but thinking of the world as a whole.</p>
<p>Every Salon will be different, tailored to its city's character, language and community. But the quality and level of experience will be universal, giving performers and public a unique forum for intimate musical communication.</p>
<p>We chose Nuremberg for our first location. Help us do it right from the beginning, and you help us spread the idea more quickly.</p>
<h3>What's a Salon?</h3>
<p>A large, luxuriously furnished room with excellent acoustics.</p>
<p>A space with unique, beautiful aesthetics, and an intellectual atmosphere. A room with especially beautiful proportions and decorations, perhaps featuring a collection of artwork or fossils, or else containing a small library of classic literature.</p>
<p>A forum for discussion, entertainment, and relaxation. An average Salon accommodates around 50 people. The layout will vary from event to event. Guests take their places in comfortable, upholstered, movable seats wherever they fancy. For breaks in the Program, standing tables and a bar in another part of the Salon offer refreshment and invite conversation.</p>
<p>The way it looks can and will vary from place to place. Traditional forms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nuremberg: German ""Prunktsaal"" - dark paneled wood, stained glass windows, beautiful exotic carpets, traditional leather armchairs</li>
<li>Paris: classic French style - gilded stucco &amp; plaster decorations, ornate mirrors, marble tops, chrystal chandeliers</li>
<li>Boston: New England Colonial-style interior - mahogany or walnut furniture, brick fireplaces, ivory &amp; nautic blue painted walls with wood accents, pewter candle-holders, linen curtains &amp; table cloths</li>
<li>Tokyo: woven straw &amp; bamboo furnishings, calligraphy &amp; artwork scrolls, tatami-inspired aesthetics, coffered ceiling, transluscent sliding doors between performance area and standing room, display of collected porcellain</li>
<li>London: Elizabethan-style luxury</li>
<li>Buenos Aires: European pomp and 19th century Latin American flair, inspired by Argentina at the peak of its growth</li>
</ul>
<p>The possibilities are endless.</p>
<h3>Better for the Public, better for the Music</h3>
<p>Music is about communication. It is a language that surpasses boundaries and wants to be personal. At the Nuremberg Salon, we care about human contact. Concerts are flexible and inviting. Instead of clapping while the soloist walks off stage, you get to shake his or her hand. Our artists don’t just play – they speak as well. For those who prefer breaks, there are drinks and there is conversation. For those who want to hear more, musicians will give their own introductions to pieces, and answer questions.</p>
<h3>How it will work:</h3>
<p>Our Salon goes right in the city center. Dinner before the concert? Walk to the performance. In the mood for exploration afterwards? Nightlife around the corner. Tons of options, and a location that's as convenient as it is beautiful.</p>
<p>Musicians give their own introductions to pieces. Guests may listen and learn, or else converse and enjoy drinks with hors d'oeuvres at the bar. Several short intermissions during the course of an evening offer listeners the chance to be social, read on their own, take a look around, hear more about the program, or just sit and relax in a welcoming setting.</p>
<p>The Nuremberg Salon will bring artists from across the world to Nuremberg. Whether you want to hear a virtuosic Pianist perform classical repertoire, experience a string quartet up close, listen to a country singer accompanied by his guitar, watch a Jazz combo improvise over the standards, or sit through a complete song cycle - our concert format makes us stand out. Here, every seat is closer than the front row.</p>
<p>These unique chamber concerts are especially suited to attract new audiences, because the personal atmosphere and manner of presentation help listeners open up to new experiences.</p>
<p>After each concert, performers are approachable and open to questions. In the reception area, drinks and chatter can carry on for hours.</p>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>Following the launch of our Non-for-Profit in the Spring of 2017, the Nuremberg Salon will create a unique space in the inner city. In the heart of the pedestrian center, our luxuriously furnished Salon with perfect acoustics, movable seating, two Steinway &amp; Sons grand pianos, a bar, adjustable lighting installations, an exhibition space, standing room tables and a reception area, will offer an ideal venue for chamber music of all styles, welcoming a broad public on a regular basis. Before and after performances, audience members will be situated to enjoy downtown Nuremberg’s nightlife.</p>
<p>In addition to its chamber music season, the Nuremberg Salon will undertake several outreach initiatives for the benefit of its surrounding community. Educational programs for children, specials events for new audiences, open rehearsals with visiting ensembles, Masterclasses for Conservatory students, and a steady media presence with published live recordings will promote the Salon's Mission of making music a positive, moving, and above all, personal force for the greater good of society.</p>
<h3>Why Fundraising?</h3>
<p>Eventually, the Nuremberg Salon, just like any other Salon we found, will be financed by Ticket Sales and a select handful of Sponsors from fields as diverse as Industry, Manufacturing, Real Estate, Insurance, and the Legal sector. For these Patrons of the Arts, we offer excellent exposure and all the benefits of traditional Non-for-Profit organizations. We also give the highest value return per donation. Because of our small size and low running costs, their money will go farther here than at any Symphony Hall or Opera House.</p>
<p>Although each city's Salon will work as an independent unit, with a budget and structure entirely its own, the process of setting up every new location will be our responsibility as the parent organization. Funding from our campaign will go towards making sure each Salon finds a suitable space, highly-qualified leadership in form of a General Manager and Music Director, and builds contacts with their local community effectively from the onset.</p>
<p>As the Nuremberg Salon Project moves forward with its Pilot Phase, we need your help to finance our efforts. Give us the chance to present our concept in more live performances, and to go forward with our local fundraising efforts.</p>
<h3>Why this matters:</h3>
<p>So much of the entertainment business has become impersonal. Concert-goers are expected to follow unspoken rules of etiquette and flip through pamphlets full of advertisements to read Program Notes written by someone who isn't even performing. The sheer size of most halls makes even the highest-paying customer one of many. Artists walk on, play, and disappear again in a cycle that's as routine as it is deadening. The concert industry is a necessity, a natural development, a well-oiled machine that keeps performers and arts managers busy. It's a survival tactic that has many strengths and many weaknesses. It works the way it must, and deserves a place in society. But we want something different.</p>
<p>Most great music was not, in fact, composed for show business. Whether it be Bach, Chopin, Monk or Sinatra - a huge portion of the repertoire plays more easily in an intimate setting. It sounds better up close. Listeners experience it as the composer intended, and performers feel more at home. Because they don't need to project as far, musicians standing on a small stage can work in greater detail. They can enjoy the experience more as well, taking liberties and being spontaneous.</p>
<p>Acoustic music isn't meant to be super-sized. No more folding chairs. No more being expected to drive there, shut up, clap, and drive home. Instead of showmanship, substance and real dialogue. We don't believe that the best music was made to be industrialized - we believe it was meant to reach you.</p>

</div></div>","Why a Salon?
A Music Salon gives each listener the highest value experience possible. It presents Artists and Public with the greatest degree of comfort and contact, while preserving the integrity and quality of the music. It perfectly suits all styles, from Baroque and Classical through Jazz and Country right up to Contemporary works and Improvisation. No wonder, then, that personalities like Beethoven, Schubert, Liszt, Chopin, and Brahms all composed the majority of their works for Salon concerts.
Our Mission
The Nuremberg Salon Project wants to share the high-quality live experience of chamber music with a broad public. No matter the musical style or time period, we want it to be personal and up close. Through the classic Salon format of our concerts, a variety of outreach projects, special events for new audiences, and a luxurious setting with pristine acoustics, we hope to promote the cultural welfare of our city’s downtown area.
A Global Concept
We want to bring the Salon experience back. More than that, we want to make it contemporary. We're starting in Nuremberg, but thinking of the world as a whole.
Every Salon will be different, tailored to its city's character, language and community. But the quality and level of experience will be universal, giving performers and public a unique forum for intimate musical communication.
We chose Nuremberg for our first location. Help us do it right from the beginning, and you help us spread the idea more quickly.
What's a Salon?
A large, luxuriously furnished room with excellent acoustics.
A space with unique, beautiful aesthetics, and an intellectual atmosphere. A room with especially beautiful proportions and decorations, perhaps featuring a collection of artwork or fossils, or else containing a small library of classic literature.
A forum for discussion, entertainment, and relaxation. An average Salon accommodates around 50 people. The layout will vary from event to event. Guests take their places in comfortable, upholstered, movable seats wherever they fancy. For breaks in the Program, standing tables and a bar in another part of the Salon offer refreshment and invite conversation.
The way it looks can and will vary from place to place. Traditional forms include:

Nuremberg: German ""Prunktsaal"" - dark paneled wood, stained glass windows, beautiful exotic carpets, traditional leather armchairs
Paris: classic French style - gilded stucco & plaster decorations, ornate mirrors, marble tops, chrystal chandeliers
Boston: New England Colonial-style interior - mahogany or walnut furniture, brick fireplaces, ivory & nautic blue painted walls with wood accents, pewter candle-holders, linen curtains & table cloths
Tokyo: woven straw & bamboo furnishings, calligraphy & artwork scrolls, tatami-inspired aesthetics, coffered ceiling, transluscent sliding doors between performance area and standing room, display of collected porcellain
London: Elizabethan-style luxury
Buenos Aires: European pomp and 19th century Latin American flair, inspired by Argentina at the peak of its growth

The possibilities are endless.
Better for the Public, better for the Music
Music is about communication. It is a language that surpasses boundaries and wants to be personal. At the Nuremberg Salon, we care about human contact. Concerts are flexible and inviting. Instead of clapping while the soloist walks off stage, you get to shake his or her hand. Our artists don’t just play – they speak as well. For those who prefer breaks, there are drinks and there is conversation. For those who want to hear more, musicians will give their own introductions to pieces, and answer questions.
How it will work:
Our Salon goes right in the city center. Dinner before the concert? Walk to the performance. In the mood for exploration afterwards? Nightlife around the corner. Tons of options, and a location that's as convenient as it is beautiful.
Musicians give their own introductions to pieces. Guests may listen and learn, or else converse and enjoy drinks with hors d'oeuvres at the bar. Several short intermissions during the course of an evening offer listeners the chance to be social, read on their own, take a look around, hear more about the program, or just sit and relax in a welcoming setting.
The Nuremberg Salon will bring artists from across the world to Nuremberg. Whether you want to hear a virtuosic Pianist perform classical repertoire, experience a string quartet up close, listen to a country singer accompanied by his guitar, watch a Jazz combo improvise over the standards, or sit through a complete song cycle - our concert format makes us stand out. Here, every seat is closer than the front row.
These unique chamber concerts are especially suited to attract new audiences, because the personal atmosphere and manner of presentation help listeners open up to new experiences.
After each concert, performers are approachable and open to questions. In the reception area, drinks and chatter can carry on for hours.
The Plan
Following the launch of our Non-for-Profit in the Spring of 2017, the Nuremberg Salon will create a unique space in the inner city. In the heart of the pedestrian center, our luxuriously furnished Salon with perfect acoustics, movable seating, two Steinway & Sons grand pianos, a bar, adjustable lighting installations, an exhibition space, standing room tables and a reception area, will offer an ideal venue for chamber music of all styles, welcoming a broad public on a regular basis. Before and after performances, audience members will be situated to enjoy downtown Nuremberg’s nightlife.
In addition to its chamber music season, the Nuremberg Salon will undertake several outreach initiatives for the benefit of its surrounding community. Educational programs for children, specials events for new audiences, open rehearsals with visiting ensembles, Masterclasses for Conservatory students, and a steady media presence with published live recordings will promote the Salon's Mission of making music a positive, moving, and above all, personal force for the greater good of society.
Why Fundraising?
Eventually, the Nuremberg Salon, just like any other Salon we found, will be financed by Ticket Sales and a select handful of Sponsors from fields as diverse as Industry, Manufacturing, Real Estate, Insurance, and the Legal sector. For these Patrons of the Arts, we offer excellent exposure and all the benefits of traditional Non-for-Profit organizations. We also give the highest value return per donation. Because of our small size and low running costs, their money will go farther here than at any Symphony Hall or Opera House.
Although each city's Salon will work as an independent unit, with a budget and structure entirely its own, the process of setting up every new location will be our responsibility as the parent organization. Funding from our campaign will go towards making sure each Salon finds a suitable space, highly-qualified leadership in form of a General Manager and Music Director, and builds contacts with their local community effectively from the onset.
As the Nuremberg Salon Project moves forward with its Pilot Phase, we need your help to finance our efforts. Give us the chance to present our concept in more live performances, and to go forward with our local fundraising efforts.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi. We are The Honey Miller Band. An all original  non-genre 7 piece  band. We have been performing in Central Florida for the past 7 years  in various forms. Our freshman ""Live"" EP was released in 2012. The original members disbanded in 2014. Since that time Honey Miller reformed organically, with purpose and direction. Dave Miller is the principal songwriter in Honey Miller yet new strength has come to the band- Band Members (Marvin Parish, Anna Lusk, Julie Klein &amp; Barry Canfield are singer-songwriters &amp; musicians. Seth Chipman (Violin) and Anthony Darmana (Percussion) &amp; four harmonizing vocalists round out the sound.  We have recently invested  several thousands of dollars and several thousands of creative hours into the ""Amongst the Boxes"" Album and the ""One Face, One Human Race"" Indiegogo Project. The WORK is DONE! The CD release &amp; Concert dates are set. </li>
<li>About the Single- ""One Face, One Human Race""-My rant about the state of the world into an iPhone voice memo evolved into a song called ""One Face, One Human Race"". The odd thing is, the voice memo was NEVER intended to be a song. With Anna Lusk on lead vocal (Surfing Santa Cocoa Beach) the song was listened to by multiple NPR DJs and a few Music Industry professionals. All encouraged us to further protect and re-record the song as it was their united opinion that this song -""One Face, One Human Race"" WILL BE A HIT!.</li>
<li>So we went into the laboratory, rolled our sleeves up and got to work. We are very pleased with the results. The message parallels the philosophy and has the support of Surfrider Foundation, Cocoa Beach, Broward &amp; Jax Chapters so far.</li>
<li>By contributing just $1 and sharing this song with friends and family you will have contributed to the organic success of a song with a message that didn't need the help of corporate america, The Voice, American idol, music industry insiders, promoters or publishers. This is a real opportunity to show the POWER OF THE PEOPLE with the help of Surfrider Foundation, despite the weight of the matrix upon us. Help us transcend and eclipse the static of the world.  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We have no expectations. Yes our goal is to sell one million downloads because THE SONG IS WORTH SHARING. If it isn't, don't buy it, don't share it. If it hits your soul like we intend it to, PLEASE DO SHARE with everyone!  It only seems right that the record companies and radio stations DO NOT HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OF OUR LISTENING EARS!</li>
<li>SURFRIDER FOUNDATION- CB supports this Project and will receive X% of all proceeds from the $1.00 ""One Face, One Human Race"" Single Download Perk and the $10.00 ""Amongst the Boxes"" Album Download Perk.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe that great music transcends musical genres and boundaries. Our songs all have positive messages and ""One Face, One Human Race""  in particular as all listeners agree, is an ""easy to listen to"" POP song of Global unity that transcends- age, race, creed, religion, politics, borders and ALL cultural differences. And in that-Lies the greatness of the song ""One Face, One Human Race.</p>
<ul>
<li>Honey Miller music is sophisticated and transcends genre. Most songs are lyrically driven and our songs have been used on multiple smaller films, surf documentaries, segways on local radio into NPR World Cafe, spun on multiple NPR stations from Florida to Texas , all the way to Sweden &amp; England. Its even in a NASA Shuttle Astronauts playlist.</li>
<li>We are challenging the status quo and moving our music forward with the help of the people. The power of the song ""One Face, One Human Race"" must be enough to move this forward organically. If the people love the song, the people will SHARE the song.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We realize this is an uphill battle. We have experience in the retail world with another (non-musical) product that has sold well over 2 million units and still sells 20,000 units per month throughout the U.S. coast-to-coast.  Two things are needed to succeed-</p>
<p>1) A great song for the global community w/ Surfrider Foundation Support, that stands alone amongst its peers </p>
<p>2) Unflinching persistence and the help of listeners throughout the surf and music listening communities globally. </p>
<ul><li>We won't stop until we have succeeded. With unflinching faith &amp; the affirmations of industry insiders, we believe ""One Face, One Human Race"" is as commercially viable as any current  pop song played on the radio today. The message is timely and current. We have sent this to the record companies. If you believe in the message, please contribute $1 and share with family and friends if it moves you....If so, we won't need the record companies, we just need YOU! </li></ul>

Our songs all have positive messages and ""One Face, One Human Race""  in particular as all listeners agree, is an ""easy to listen to"" POP song of Global unity that transcends- age, race, creed, religion, politics, borders and ALL cultural differences. And in that-Lies the greatness of the song ""One Face, One Human Race.

Honey Miller music is sophisticated and transcends genre. Most songs are lyrically driven and our songs have been used on multiple smaller films, surf documentaries, segways on local radio into NPR World Cafe, spun on multiple NPR stations from Florida to Texas , all the way to Sweden & England. Its even in a NASA Shuttle Astronauts playlist.
We are challenging the status quo and moving our music forward with the help of the people. The power of the song ""One Face, One Human Race"" must be enough to move this forward organically. If the people love the song, the people will SHARE the song.


Risks & Challenges
We realize this is an uphill battle. We have experience in the retail world with another (non-musical) product that has sold well over 2 million units and still sells 20,000 units per month throughout the U.S. coast-to-coast.  Two things are needed to succeed-
1) A great song for the global community w/ Surfrider Foundation Support, that stands alone amongst its peers 
2) Unflinching persistence and the help of listeners throughout the surf and music listening communities globally. 
We won't stop until we have succeeded. With unflinching faith & the affirmations of industry insiders, we believe ""One Face, One Human Race"" is as commercially viable as any current  pop song played on the radio today. The message is timely and current. We have sent this to the record companies. If you believe in the message, please contribute $1 and share with family and friends if it moves you....If so, we won't need the record companies, we just need YOU!

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p></p>
<p>Hey Everyone, I’m Angela Burns and I’m super excited to tell you all about a new project that I’ve been working on.  It’s a full length album of original music that I’m hoping to bring into the studio and make a spectacular record. What makes this project so unique and exciting for me is that it is the first time I’ve created a collection of songs that are what I would consider worship songs but they are also written sort of in my own unique style of song-writing that you may have heard in some of my other projects. </p>
<p>I am a singer/songwriter and I am absolutely in love with the process of crafting and creating music as art. I love word pictures, imagery and phonetics. I love to play around with sounds and styles. And I super love the whole recording process. Taking my little song and giving it to other creative people who help it to blossom into its full potential.</p>
<p>I also love the passionate pursuit of God through worship.  He is truly my greatest passion, and it  brings me the highest form of delight when I am able to draw others into His presence to encounter His beauty, goodness and love.  </p>
<p>Up to this point in my life, these two musical arenas have been somewhat different from each other stylistically.  My songwriting being more lyric driven an quirky and my worship style being more free flowing, simple and spontaneous. So I’ve endeavored to sort of mesh these two parts of my musical self to create a worship record that leans more toward my style and expression of song writing.  </p>
<p>I sat down at the keyboard with this goal in mind, and I am absolutely thrilled with the result.  I feel with all my heart that these songs carry so much hope and peace and light-heartedness and healing.  Not just in their message, but the very essence and spirit of these things, I believe, can be felt through the music.  So whether you are someone who shares my faith and belief system or not, I truly feel that the goodness of what this music contains is for anyone and everyone.  </p>
<p>So I just really hope that you would be willing to help me to bring these songs into their full potential and out into the world!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>For this project to fly, I will need to raise $15,000.  My personal goal is to save $5,000 of this myself (I already have $3,000. yay!)  The balance of $10,000 I'm hoping to raise through your generous support. </p>
<p>The total $15,000 will cover all costs for the record including all production, studio time, paying the musicians, mixing, mastering and album art. Pretty much everything. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">So, here's how it will work:  If we break it down, each song costs about $1,200 -$1,400 to make. So, the amount of money I raise will equal the number of songs I can do.  That means that no matter what, I will be recording SOMETHING...either an EP or a full length.  But I reeeaaally want to make a proper full length record for you all!  </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p>Also, I really wanted to invest myself in my perks to connect more fully with you guys!  Check them out...I'm actually just as excited about fulfilling the perks as I am making the record itself.  It's going to be a lot of fun all the way around!!</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">The Impact</span></p>
<p></p>
</div><div> <p>I believe that music is one of the most powerful, beautiful sources for life and truth to flow.  And I believe that God is the giver of all life, beauty and truth. It's both exciting and a little scary (vulnerable) for me to invite you into my personal worship space but I'm aching to share my heart and my sound.  And I'm full of hope that you will find rest for your souls and encouragement for your mind through these songs.  And just from a purely aesthetic point of view, I'm hoping you will just simply enjoy the music.  I have the privilege and opportunity to work with some SUPER talented musicians and producers for this particular record.  The sound and product, I assure you, will be professional, creative, and interesting to listen to.   </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span><br/>
</h3> <p>One of the risks is that, honestly, I am a relatively unknown artist at this point.  I am relying solely on word of mouth from those people who know me, and for people who don't know me to take a chance on me.  If you would like to take a peak at my first record, Arbitrary Mind, visit <a href=""http://www.noisetrade.com/angelaburns"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.noisetrade.com/angelaburns</a> or find me on iTunes.  I also just released a single, New Wine, which is featured on the NoiseTrade site and can be viewed here as well <a href=""https://youtu.be/9UweI_mf3Cs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>https://youtu.be/9UweI_mf3Cs</a>. </p>
<p>The second risk is that if I don't reach my goal in this campaign it will be that much harder to make a full length record.  My plan though, is to do everything, everything, EVERYTHING I can to raise this money (even if I have to do like a christmas gift-wrapping fund raiser, or whatever...!) because I believe in these songs that much. And I'm determined to make this happen! The more you are able to support, the less I will have to beg on the street. ;)   </p>
<p>Also, as I mentioned above, I'm so looking forward to fulfilling my perks.  (So I wouldn't call that a risk at all.)  I can't wait to be more connected to you.  </p>

<p>I took a step back to give my undivided attention to my family as wife and mom of two growing sons. For me, this was a very difficult decision to make. I felt I was moving in the right direction but God told me to slow down. Having my family is such a gift and they mean the world to me, yet, not pushing forward in music ministry at the speed of which I originally intended was a hard decision, but the right one. <b><i>Everything else became secondary</i></b>.</p>

<li>Venue - We will be performing at the best facilities in Chicago. If this raises enough interest, we will perform at additional venues.</li>
<li>Performers - Our performers need to get paid for what they do. They are professional musicians and playwright who are writing an original script AND re-writing Mozart’s music!</li>
<li>Costumes - Clothes are expensive now, but they were REALLY extravagant back in the 18th century. We want to look nice for the production!</li>
<li>Recording - We will be creating an audio and video recording of this project.</li>
<li>Programs - Our audience members deserve to have a nice program in their hands.</li>

We are combining elements of classical music, theater, and comedy to provide a new, less formal concert experience. To do this successfully, we have put together an all-star team of classical musicians and a seasoned playwright to collaborate and combine these elements into a single polished performance. It will be both impressive and hilarious.</p><h3>Our Team</h3><p>Our two soloists James Brinkmann (flute) and Alli Gessner (oboe) are great friends, except when it comes to this concerto. To solve their disagreement, they are bringing the competition to an audience who will determine the outcome.

<p>Ghost Town Remedy was started way back in 2012 after Steve and TJ's old band the Junglebots broke up. Some of the songs/ideas that would have been Junglebots 2.0  material instead were reworked with this new band in mind. After writing close to 30 songs we decided to pick the best ones and begin recording an album. These first couple songs ended up on our self-titled EP which was released in March 2014 and the remaining songs we finished after that became ""Caffeine Dreams"". It took awhile but after a few years of writing and recording we finally have an album that we are proud of and beyond excited to share with you!</p>

<p>As years went by, we had less and less opportunities in Iran, to make music, to be seen, and to be heard. Given the fact that our form of music was not having any chance to be played in public, or be given the permission to be released, we had to get out of the country to find more opportunities. </p>
<p>We went to Turkey in 2011, did a small tour, that led to another small tour in Germany in 2012, and from that point on we got more and more invitations to play in Europe. 2013 was our first long tour in Europe. We did it again in 2014 for three months. We were living the dream!</p>
<p>By the end of 2014 we attracted the attention of Parvenue Records in Nuernberg and we got signed by them that led to the release of our first LP album.</p>
<p>This is Rock n' Roll history! We were one of the first bands from Iran, touring, releasing, and living the Rock n' Roll life in Europe!</p>
<p>Of course we had loads of trouble to deal with. Every year waiting for 9 months, applying for visas,  working our asses off to earn the money for the tours, and of course losing the feeling of where home is.</p>
<p>By the end of 2015, after we did a tour with a ""Peace Message"" from the Middle East, we received a German Residency for a year, to finally be able to settle down and work with full force. Little did we know that things might get more difficult.</p>

<p>Hi I'm Miri Hunter, lead vocalist, songwriter and guitarist for the Southern California Desert Band, Hunter and the Wick'd. We are making our first CD. It is a collection of songs written in the hi desert of Joshua Tree. Songs that are inspired (we are pictured in the photo performing at the Hard Rock in Palm Springs) and I come from varying musical traditions. Within the realm of music, we unite as a team to create a montage that is representative of Americana music influenced by desert dreams.</p>
<p>I moved to the desert in 2013. I originally meant to stay two or three months, but the majesty of this world would not let me go.  It opened me creatively in ways that were not possible in other places that I had lived.  I want to share this music with those who cannot be here, but are desirous of expanding creatively.  This recording should be thought of as an oasis of music.</p>
<p>By funding this project you will be enabling people from all over the world to experience the magic of my home, the desert.  In addition, you will also be helping four musicians in their dream of completing and sharing this music.</p>
<p>Although this is our first recording together, we have all been playing together off and on for several years.  As a band we have played at bars, saloons, art galleries, festivals, as well as wild west shows and concert spaces.   As a collective, we have many years of musical and stage experience.   My songwriting partner and I have written music both together and with others.  Although diverse in our musical backgrounds, when we come together to create something new our ideas mesh organically.  It's a rare and valued partnership.</p>
<p>Funds raised for this campaign go towards studio costs, musicians fees, mastering, promotion and marketing, and distribution.  In return for your contribution you receive ten songs full of rhythm, rhyme, harmony and soulful musings.</p>
<p>Reaching our goal........we will!   Funds from performances will make up any deficit.  These desert songs want to be heard and they will be.....</p>
<p>Over the two year journey of this music, the band has had some local hits, many of which, are included in this collection.  So if you have been waiting for a recording of ""Tumbleweed Connection"" or ""Dance All Night in California,"" and ""I Don't Wanna Talk Right Now"" here's your chance.....</p>
<p>This project is a valuable addition to the world right now.  Many are feeling sad, disillusioned and lost.  One of our songs, Dance Like You're Falling In Love, encourages each of us by telling us</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">you gotta dance like you're falling in love</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">you can't hold back, you gotta let go</p>

<p>I am a composer and a teacher with many years experience. <strong>I taught modern harmony for thirty years at the Université de Montréal.</strong> Now I'm retired and I want it to be available to a larger audience, online. </p>
<p>The course will be divided into 10 one-hour units, subdivided into segments of 20 or 30 minutes. Each unit will cover one kind of modern harmony (see below), and will include audio and score examples, as well as exercises. I'll be putting the course up on YouTube gradually over the next year.</p>
<p>First, I'll cover the outgrowths of traditional harmony in thirds: modes, linear harmony, added note chords, extensions (9ths, 11ths, 13ths), and polychords.</p>
<p>Then I'll discuss several other approaches less anchored in the western tradition: intervallic harmony, cells and sets, and stratified harmony.</p>
<p>Finally, I'll discuss how to combine these various techniques within the same piece.</p>
<p>I have for years made lots of pedagogical material available free on my website. See: <a href=""http://alanbelkinmusic.com/site/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://alanbelkinmusic.com/site/en/</a>   </p>
<p> <strong>I am offering my work on this online course for free.</strong> The preparation and the recording will take a lot of my time, but I strongly believe in the future of quality online education and I want to make this contribution. However recording and video editing cost money: that's why I'm here. I need a about $11,000 to pay for the production costs of the course.</p>

<h2><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Making an Album </span></h2>
<p><strong>What does it take? Money and the right people. </strong></p>
<p>My name is Lee Anna, I've been singing and writing songs my entire life, performing everywhere from New York to Disney to basically anywhere you can imagine. I've been in and around recording studios, but never committed to doing a full studio album for a couple reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It costs a ton.</li>
<li>You can spend $5,000 on one song and walk out with something that sounds nothing like you--or anything good for that matter--at the end of the day.</li>
</ol>
<p>As I've been posting more singing videos this year, I realized that in order to capture my [very loud] voice and have it reach more people, I do need to professionally record. </p>
<p>And that's where you come in.  <strong>See, the one thing that speaks louder than a 100,000 followers online is 1,000 who will actually buy your music.  </strong>This campaign is my way of not only combatting the costs of studio time but also to show potential collaborators and maybe even labels that there are people out there (lots of them!) invested in seeing this album come to life.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Whatever you can contribute to this album--$1, $5, $50--you'll be the first to get the finished product once it's ready early next year AS WELL AS a link to download four live recorded songs today as a thank you.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Donate $1-50: 4 songs to download and play on any device today, plus a copy of the album once it's finished</li>
<li>Donate $50+: You name in the acknowledgements of the album, plus the 4 songs to download today and a copy of the album once it's finished </li>
<li>There are also perks like a custom Happy Birthday song, a signed copy of the physical CD, profit-sharing and more!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What Your Contribution Does</h3>
<p>Proceeds will go towards studio costs. Though the project will most likely end up costing close to $10,000, our goal is $3,000 to help finance it but also to show real, genuine, money-where-your-mouth-is interest in the album.</p>
<p>I'm committed to bringing something positive into the world--I feel like music is my small way of contributing to a positive, loving society, by bringing people together--and that's really what <i>your</i> contribution is about. Building something beautiful together. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Recording the right songs</li>
<li>Making sure the sound is right, the team is right, and that we're doing it for the right reasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've been gigging and going around to open mics most of the year, working out new material and really focusing in on my sound and what makes it unique. There are still a ton of lessons to be learned, but I felt like I needed to go out and try out originals in front of strangers in order to learn some very valuable ones, and did indeed!</p>
<h3>Other Ways to Help</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Your support means so, so, so much to me. I cannot tell you how much your shares online have already helped get us to the point we are right now!</p>
<p>If you cannot contribute monetarily but want to do something, feel free to share this campaign on your social media, comment on videos about it, etc.! All of that helps organically reach more people and also is just appreciated by me that someone out there is cheering on the team! </p>

My second album, titled ""Torn Between Pages, Vol. 1: Make It Out Alive,"" was just released on September 13, 2016. You can stream it on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrWu1qIF4QVVjw_32VP2BJjqP0PLOJpy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YouTube here</a> - These songs touch on depression, relationship struggles, family dynamics, suicide, and general fears that everyone experiences in their own lives.

It is with the utmost pride that I present you with what I’ve accomplished thus far and why I'm asking for your help to keep moving forward.</p><p align=""center"">We need funding to create the next series of music videos, songs, live performances, and eventually an organization dedicated to personal empowerment, positive mental health changes and suicide prevention.</p><p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485603731/kb0jgrvmoqkjlwicgsi6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p align=""center"">Lucidious Music has become much more than music. It has become a movement and a family of over 100,000 people that come from all different ages and ethnicities. This is a movement that empowers people and enables them to embrace their passions, face their fears, and take ownership of their personal struggles. <u>All</u> of us face adversity and insecurity, but some of us don’t handle the pressure well and spiral into a depression that seems impossible to escape from. Unfortunately, some choose to take their own life instead of seeking out help.</p><p align=""center"">By joining this movement, we can continue to make a difference and continue to save lives through music. If you’re on board… please keep reading.</p><p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485603633/h5hgfvjlh4norcoxuvk1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p align=""center"">About a year ago I truly began to grasp how harsh the internet and cyberbullying can be. As this movement gained traction I started receiving a variety of messages daily. These messages were stories about the mental torture these people were going through.</p><p align=""center"">I receive messages from 9-year-olds and 65-year-olds who face the same insecurities. Sometimes, we just need a little inspiration and an outlet when we’re feeling low. Ultimately, we ALL have the power to create happiness in our lives. We are ALL unique and capable in our own way.</p><p align=""center"">That’s why I make music. I want to give the world something relatable that spreads positivity, motivation, and desire to keep moving forward.</p><p align=""center""><strong><u>Why Did I Start Doing This?</u></strong></p><p align=""center"">I started writing lyrics as an outlet for my stress and to work on bad habits that were causing problems in my life. For many years, writing was simply something I did behind closed doors. At some point along the way I decided organize my work and share it with others. That’s when I realized there was a greater purpose in what I was doing. These songs, videos, and messages actually helped people. They started to get people out of depression and move them in a positive direction… it’s powerful. I didn’t realize how expensive it would be to create all of this in a professional and efficient way, but this past year has shown me how much of an investment it takes to make an impact. I want to show you some of the videos and messages I received in 2016.</p><div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/tPoybCYVltw?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485650346/jmxq25sqiimrlfgrpe2y.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485650367/t5ilgmpysqkimnxqyfyo.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p align=""center""><strong><u>The Music</u></strong></p><p align=""center"">Below are a few links to songs and videos for you to view!</p><p align=""center""><strong>“Moment of Silence” </strong>– A song dedicated to Taylor Eller, a friend that took his own life about a year ago.

My second album, titled ""Torn Between Pages, Vol. 1: Make It Out Alive,"" was just released on September 13, 2016. You can stream it on YouTube here - These songs touch on depression, relationship struggles, family dynamics, suicide, and general fears that everyone experiences in their own lives. If you haven't seen any of our music videos, be sure to check them out here!So… here we are. It is with the utmost pride that I present you with what I’ve accomplished thus far and why I'm asking for your help to keep moving forward.We need funding to create the next series of music videos, songs, live performances, and eventually an organization dedicated to personal empowerment, positive mental health changes and suicide prevention.Lucidious Music has become much more than music. It has become a movement and a family of over 100,000 people that come from all different ages and ethnicities. This is a movement that empowers people and enables them to embrace their passions, face their fears, and take ownership of their personal struggles. All of us face adversity and insecurity, but some of us don’t handle the pressure well and spiral into a depression that seems impossible to escape from. Unfortunately, some choose to take their own life instead of seeking out help.By joining this movement, we can continue to make a difference and continue to save lives through music. If you’re on board… please keep reading.About a year ago I truly began to grasp how harsh the internet and cyberbullying can be. As this movement gained traction I started receiving a variety of messages daily. These messages were stories about the mental torture these people were going through.I receive messages from 9-year-olds and 65-year-olds who face the same insecurities. Sometimes, we just need a little inspiration and an outlet when we’re feeling low. Ultimately, we ALL have the power to create happiness in our lives. We are ALL unique and capable in our own way.That’s why I make music. I want to give the world something relatable that spreads positivity, motivation, and desire to keep moving forward.Why Did I Start Doing This?I started writing lyrics as an outlet for my stress and to work on bad habits that were causing problems in my life. For many years, writing was simply something I did behind closed doors. At some point along the way I decided organize my work and share it with others. That’s when I realized there was a greater purpose in what I was doing. These songs, videos, and messages actually helped people. They started to get people out of depression and move them in a positive direction… it’s powerful. I didn’t realize how expensive it would be to create all of this in a professional and efficient way, but this past year has shown me how much of an investment it takes to make an impact. I want to show you some of the videos and messages I received in 2016.The MusicBelow are a few links to songs and videos for you to view!“Moment of Silence” – A song dedicated to Taylor Eller, a friend that took his own life about a year ago. This song touches on a variety of topics, but overall is a tribute to anyone who has lost a loved one.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibuCpoaUEMM“Save Me” – A suicide prevention song written from the perspective of someone who attempts to take their life, intertwined with lyrics advocating suicide prevention.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r02VzRBAedA“Changes” – A motivational song from my first album that inspires listeners to get back up and persevere through obstacles they face in their life.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xExLkzE8mCEThe PlanOur plan is pretty simple. The music itself is already available on iTunes, Spotify, Amazon, Google Play, among many other platforms. I want to release high-quality official music videos with strong messages, as well as tour worldwide to perform and promote the songs. If we can afford it I would love to start Torn Between Pages, Vol. II after the music videos are completed.Ultimately, our goal is to create a foundation that will educate youth on suicide awareness and how to better deal with their struggles, along with promoting mental health practices through the arts.Most importantly, I will continue spreading my movement online as I have done for the last few years. I continually post inspirational messages and create social campaigns dedicated to personal development, mindset shifts and creating success.Lucid’s Movement 2017 BudgetOver The Next Few YearsOf course, we want this movement to grow exponentially and spread to people around the globe. We want to start a form of mentorship program/non-profit and/or foundation dedicated to benefiting youth in need of help with their mental health. Additionally, we would like to create a record label that will develop independent artists that stand for similar causes.SupportOf course, we hope you give us your support because it will directly result in thousands of lives being impacted, and saved. In addition to seeing the products created, you will get a reward for being part of this movement too.

<p>From the moment the young English tenor James Beard first performed with Handel in 1734, the composer began fashioning roles for him. This led to a new idea – the tenor as Oratorio’s leading man. Until this moment, sopranos and castrati had dominated the operatic stage. As Handel invented and shaped the English Oratorio, and took advantage of John Beard’s special talents, he was able to compose pieces that, to this day, define the elements of this genre, and form a repertoire for the tenor voice of unsurpassed depth and beauty.   </p>
<p>Co-GRAMMY winners for Best Opera recording of 2014, conductor Stephen Stubbs and tenor Aaron Sheehan, soon after the presentation of the GRAMMY Award started looking for a concept that could form the basis of a collaboration featuring the solo tenor with Stubbs’ Pacific MusicWorks Orchestra. When they hit upon the extraordinary story of the career of John Beard and his unique relationship with Handel, it was clear that this would make for a glorious concert program. Once the music had been examined to select the most outstanding arias, it became clear that this would also make an ideal debut recording for both Sheehan and the orchestra.   </p>
<p>Concert performances of Handel’s Tenor will be held in Seattle in February 2017. In the same time period the magnificent recording venue near Seattle in the cloister chapel of Bastyr as well as the entire orchestra have been reserved to make this recording. The final, and supremely important element is to guarantee the funding of this project which, at a very reasonable price, will bring a recorded souvenir into being for what is sure to be a musical highpoint in the career of Sheehan and Pacific MusicWorks, and a notable revival of an important aspect of Handel’s works.<br/> </p>

I was living the life of an artist - spending most of my nights alone in my studio, always working towards daunting deadlines. Partying, which we excused as networking, was becoming a large part of my life in order to be a part of the art scene. I often felt totally exhausted after stressful times, like exhibition openings, and was struggling with the fallout. Then I discovered yoga. Initially, I saw it as a tool to perform better, to train my body to function more efficiently. The most beautiful part about this science of life called Yoga is that it slowly but gradually helped me to <strong>develop a more intimate relationship with myself</strong>. Without originally aiming for it, I became more and more aware and conscious of what was going on in me. I became more <strong>receptive to the beauty of life</strong>.</p><p>Bhakti yoga, the yoga of devotion, and in my case the chanting of mantras, entirely changed my life. This tool helped me to <strong>pacify my mind</strong> and gave me the strength to look inwardly. I learned to listen to what’s alive in me and stay curious in a non-judgmental way. Which has allowed me to respond accordingly and make my life a happier one.</p><p>For a few years now I have been practicing this intuitive art of self-exploration - switching off the analytic rational mind and making space for the realm of emotions and whatever is alive in me. Having received such great healing from this practice it is my biggest dream to share this precious gift with as many people as possible. That is the reason I want to create this album - so we all can go on this journey together.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Chanting as a key to meditation</strong></h2><p>One translation of the Sanskrit word ""mantra"" is the ""<strong>protection of the mind</strong>"" - it is meant to give the mind guidance. Mantras are special, sacred sounds that embody various messages and help to invoke things like truth, reality, light, peace, love, knowledge and action into the practitioner’s life. It can be seen as a form of meditation, helping to calm the internal chatter and overcome the busy monkey mind.</p><p>As humans, we are constantly thinking, always rationally reflecting, explaining, and planning. Many of these thoughts tend to be reoccurring, repeating every day. Unfortunately, the majority of them are negative judgments.  How do we get out of this viscous circle?</p><p>With a mantra, you stick to a formula, a syllable or a melody. It is something you repeat over and over protecting your mind from excessive thoughts. The goal is to <strong>clear out thought patterns</strong> that don't serve you anymore and rather to focus your inner conversation on actually want more of in your life. With focusing on the positive, you gradually rewire the neurological pathways in your brain. Our thoughts follow the path of least resistance - so we have to pave a path where we will end up having a more positive, empowered and clear vision of who we are and who we want to be.</p><p>The power of reciting mantras is extremely effective regardless of your belief system. Hopefully, these chants will support you on your spiritual path if you are seeking some sort of guidance. If not, you still receive the benefits of calming down and going into a <strong>state of relaxation</strong>.</p><p>Scientifically, meditation and mantras induce the relaxation response through activating the parasympathetic nervous system. By chanting regularly you turn down your sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for your fight or flight reactions in life.  Being agitated, stressed and nervous are signs of an over stimulated sympathetic nervous system. Which can potentially lead to <strong>stress related diseases</strong> such as anxiety, obesity, heart disease, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, depression, gastrointestinal problems, asthma etc.</p><p>Through chanting, we send vibrations &amp; stimulation to our parasympathetic nervous system encouraging it to be activated. Activating the parasympathetic nervous system results in relaxation. In this state of calmness, we receive benefits such as improved memory, immune function, sleep, and higher levels of growth hormones. It also may help tame inflammation, allergic responses, and tension headaches.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Plenty of good reasons to start chanting!</strong></p><p> </p><h2><strong>The mantra healing project</strong></h2><p>My intention is to use the raised money for the <strong>professional production of an entire album</strong>. As every mantra has a very specific purpose, I will provide you with the background information. I will explain various chants used for different goals so you that you have can have the choice of what you want to work on.</p><p>My dream is to help people find tools that they can use in their lives to better help themselves- to empower others to manifest their dreams and unleash their own healing powers that are dormant within themselves. Yoga, meditation and chanting are powerful methods that can be used to learn to take <strong>responsibility for your own happiness</strong>. I want to support others in achieving their personal contentment.</p><p>I have been given the opportunity to collaborate with some amazing people. With some fun exercises and my guidance, you will learn step by step how to apply the mantras to your own needs. We’ll explore meditation in a fresh and modern way providing methods and ideas of how to integrate the practice into your daily life.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2><p>There is a lot involved in making a record, especially as an independent artist. Without having the support and funds of a record label and because this music is targeting a niche community, it is extremely challenging.</p><p>Mantras come from a long-standing tradition starting in the Indian culture. The ideal starting point for my album is to receive coaching from an expert in Rishikesh, India before the actual recording. Anandra George is an internationally respected mantra teacher and <strong>sacred musician</strong>, she is frequently invited to teach and lead chanting/kīrtan at the world’s largest yoga festivals. She will be coaching me, supporting the manifestation of this project, teaching me this ancient practice of sound through her profound knowledge.</p><p>We’ve put together a budget of $10,000 to cover all of the expenses to make my/your dream record, as well as prepare it in such a way that its most beneficial for people. Here is what that $10,000 includes:</p><p>• Production, engineering, studio time</p><p>• Professional studio musicians</p><p>• Mixing the record</p><p>• Mastering the record</p><p>• Album artwork</p><p>• Coaching in Rishikesh with my Mantra teacher, Anandra George</p><p>• Travel expenses to India</p><p>• Marketing &amp; promotion</p><p> </p><p>If I don't receive the full amount I will be focus on the recording of the mantras in Kolkata. The smaller the budget - the simpler the sound will be :)</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>Once the album is funded, I promise to complete it in a timely manner and I am fully committed to making sure every single perk is sent out to you as soon as possible! I am very grateful for your support in creating this record!</p><p> </p><h2><strong>What can you do?</strong></h2><p>Please help me spread the word to your friends, family members, classmates, and every other random person you meet :)</p><p>With a common effort we reach the goal much easier! Every Penny counts, so even if you are short on money, a small amount shows me your support and helps me on so many levels !</p><p>Even if you can’t donate, please spread the good word to others and especially everyone you think this project could be beneficial for!</p><p>Another easy way to spread the word is to share it with friends on your FB wall - you will bring this project to a new and broader audience  and support me immensely!</p><p> </p><h2><strong>&lt;3 Thank you &lt;3</strong></h2><p> </p><p>I am already deeply grateful that you took the time to read all of this! Thanks for considering donating some of your hard-earned money to make this music come to life.</p><p>I am very moved and humbled by your support and I am highly motivated and excited to continue on my path with making this record!

In October 2016, we were given a rare manuscript that had been hidden in an attic for almost seventy years. Duo Odéon, our violin-piano duo, had the honor of giving the premiere of “Valses from Specter of the Rose,” by the violinist Werner Gebauer based on Antheil’s film music, in November 2016 in Portland, Oregon. The “Valses” form the centerpiece of our recording project—<i>Duo Odéon: The Antheil-Gebauer Works</i>. This summer we will travel to Boyce, Virginia to record the “Valses,” Antheil’s Sonatina for Violin and Piano, and his Violin Concerto (arranged for piano by the composer himself) with the label Sono Luminus. The album will receive international distribution in Spring 2018.</p><p>Until November, neither the “Valses” nor the Concerto (the violin/piano version) had ever been performed live. In fact, they only exist in manuscript form. Previously recorded, but now out of print, the Sonatina completes this set of three pieces composed by two musical friends, Antheil and Gebauer. We are excited to share this music with fresh audiences and invite the next generation of musicians to discover twentieth century and contemporary classical music through our performance of Antheil’s work. After the release of the recording, we plan to intensify our performance schedule, including educational programming and community outreach.</p><p>You can be an instrumental (no pun intended!) part of making <i>Duo Odéon: The Antheil-Gebauer Works</i> happen! Your donation to our recording project is not only an investment in a tangible, lasting piece of art and history, but also in our commitment to long-term educational outreach.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484277526/rraimyrbvklorvnnxnks.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>The Nitty Gritty</strong></h3><p>The total cost for our recording project is $18,500.

<p></p>
<p>Né à Montréal d’un père noir Américain et d’une mère
blanche Canadienne, Pierre Perpall amorce sa carrière artistique à titre de
danseur. En 1963, il remporte un concours de twist présenté au Palais du
Commerce de Montréal et présidé par nul autre que Chubby Checker. À 13 ans, il devient chanteur au sein de la
formation R&amp;B ""The Poodles"". Il se joint ensuite au groupe The
Jeans, renommé The Beethovens, et grave un premier 45 tour.</p>
<p>Surnommé ""L'Homme élastique"", Pierre Perpall obtient un premier succès au palmarès en
1966 avec <i>Ma Lilli Hello</i>. L’année
suivante, il reçoit un trophée le consacrant meilleur chanteur de R&amp;B au
Québec. Véritable précurseur, il a été un dès tout premiers noirs à faire des
apparitions à la télé québécoise, ouvrant la voie aux artistes de couleur qui
allaient lui succéder.</p>
<p>Au début des années 1970, il part à la conquête des
États-Unis et présente une série de spectacles au Nevada, en Californie et en
Floride où il bat des records d’assistance. Il perfectionne alors son style
unique qui conjugue chanson et danse, dans des chorégraphies inédites qui
électrifient le public. En plus de composer ses propres chansons, il apprend le
piano, la guitare, la basse et la batterie.</p>
<p>                                        ★ <b>Les </b><b>années</b><b> disco et de break-danse ★</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Cinq ans plus tard, il revient au Québec, alors que la
vague disco bat son plein. Entre 1976 et 1984, il est sur toutes les scènes,
enregistrant une vingtaine de singles au sein des groupes Purple Flash et Pluton
and the Humanoids. Parmi ses grands succès, on compte<span>  <i>We Can
Make it</i>, <i>Da, Da, Da</i> et <i>Crème soufflée</i>. </span></p>
<p>En parallèle, il contribue à l’essor du <i>break-dancing</i> au Québec, prenant
plusieurs troupes de <i>breakdancers</i>
sous son aile, devenant alors promoteur de spectacle. Dans les mêmes années, il
fondra une compagnie de disque sous le nom des Productions Permont, qui
produiront de nouveaux talents tels que Nancy Martinez, Martin Stevens, Michel
Stax, Laurence Jalbert et plusieurs autres.</p>
<p>                                          ★ <b>Une carrière avec les plus grands ★</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Au cours de sa carrière, Pierre Perpall s’est produit en
compagnie de grands noms du showbiz, tels que Céline Dion, Bonnie Pointer, The Commodores,
The Drifters, The Best of The Platters, Joe Dassin, Nanette Workman, B.B.
King et Boule Noire pour ne nommer que ceux-ci. Comme chanteur, il enregistre plusieurs
45 tours, 12 albums et produit comme réalisateur une trentaine d’albums pour
différents artistes. <i>Il a aussi fait
paraître des recueils de ses chansons, dont Mes plus grands succès 1967-1982 et
Purple Flash Greatest Hits.</i><b><span>  </span></b>Il vend présentement ses compositions par
Internet ainsi qu'à des compagnies de disques à l’étranger, notamment au Japon,
l’Allemagne, l’Angleterre, d'où ses chansons sont très en demande.</p>
<p>Pierre Perpall, toujours actif et aussi énergique, donne régulièrement
des spectacles privés et tiendra l’affiche au Casino de Montréal ainsi que la
Place des Arts, comme chanteur et réalisateur dans ses revues musicales toutes
plus colorées les unes que les autres dont <i>Sh…
Boom, Sh… Boom</i> et <i>Las Vegas à Québec,</i>
dans lequel il reprend des succès des années 1950 et 1960. </p><p><span>♫♪¸.•*¨*•♪♫♪♥*♫♪♫¸.•*¨*•♥*♫♪¸.•*¨*•♪♫♪,♥*♫♪¸.•*¨*•♪♫•*¨*•.¸¸¸.•*¨*•♥*♫♫*• <br/></span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1342309/files/20150331085806-Ornement_-_Les_artistes_et_amis.jpg?1427817486"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1332427/files/20150327184125-Pierre_Perpall_et_James_Brown_2.jpg?1427506885"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1342739/files/20150331111428-PP_Amies_Artistes_3.jpg?1427825668"" src="""" style=""width: 625.288px; height: 473px;""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1359678/files/20150406103936-PP_Amies_Artistes_corrig_.jpg?1428341976"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1359680/files/20150406103950-PP_Amies_Artistes_corrig_2.jpg?1428341990"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1342316/files/20150331090045-Ornement_-_Les_Contreparties.jpg?1427817645"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

50 ans de carrière musicale produire un spectacle en salle avec 12
musiciens, artistes invités et les honneurs que je mérite. J’aurais besoin de
vos contributions et encouragements financiers pour m'aider à réaliser ce rêve qui
me tient à cœur! Et c’est celui de rendre hommage à un artiste de chez nous,
qui a su donner à son public, et suivre les vagues musicales depuis 50 ans.
                                        ★ Les débuts d’un pionnier au Québec ★

Né à Montréal d’un père noir Américain et d’une mère
blanche Canadienne, Pierre Perpall amorce sa carrière artistique à titre de
danseur. En 1963, il remporte un concours de twist présenté au Palais du
Commerce de Montréal et présidé par nul autre que Chubby Checker. À 13 ans, il devient chanteur au sein de la
formation R&B ""The Poodles"". Il se joint ensuite au groupe The
Jeans, renommé The Beethovens, et grave un premier 45 tour.
Surnommé ""L'Homme élastique"", Pierre Perpall obtient un premier succès au palmarès en
1966 avec Ma Lilli Hello. L’année
suivante, il reçoit un trophée le consacrant meilleur chanteur de R&B au
Québec. Véritable précurseur, il a été un dès tout premiers noirs à faire des
apparitions à la télé québécoise, ouvrant la voie aux artistes de couleur qui
allaient lui succéder.
Au début des années 1970, il part à la conquête des
États-Unis et présente une série de spectacles au Nevada, en Californie et en
Floride où il bat des records d’assistance. Il perfectionne alors son style
unique qui conjugue chanson et danse, dans des chorégraphies inédites qui
électrifient le public. En plus de composer ses propres chansons, il apprend le
piano, la guitare, la basse et la batterie.
                                        ★ Les années disco et de break-danse ★

Cinq ans plus tard, il revient au Québec, alors que la
vague disco bat son plein. Entre 1976 et 1984, il est sur toutes les scènes,
enregistrant une vingtaine de singles au sein des groupes Purple Flash et Pluton
and the Humanoids. Parmi ses grands succès, on compte  We Can
Make it, Da, Da, Da et Crème soufflée. 
En parallèle, il contribue à l’essor du break-dancing au Québec, prenant
plusieurs troupes de breakdancers
sous son aile, devenant alors promoteur de spectacle. Dans les mêmes années, il
fondra une compagnie de disque sous le nom des Productions Permont, qui
produiront de nouveaux talents tels que Nancy Martinez, Martin Stevens, Michel
Stax, Laurence Jalbert et plusieurs autres.
                                          ★ Une carrière avec les plus grands ★

Au cours de sa carrière, Pierre Perpall s’est produit en
compagnie de grands noms du showbiz, tels que Céline Dion, Bonnie Pointer, The Commodores,
The Drifters, The Best of The Platters, Joe Dassin, Nanette Workman, B.B.
King et Boule Noire pour ne nommer que ceux-ci. Comme chanteur, il enregistre plusieurs
45 tours, 12 albums et produit comme réalisateur une trentaine d’albums pour
différents artistes. Il a aussi fait
paraître des recueils de ses chansons, dont Mes plus grands succès 1967-1982 et
Purple Flash Greatest Hits.  Il vend présentement ses compositions par
Internet ainsi qu'à des compagnies de disques à l’étranger, notamment au Japon,
l’Allemagne, l’Angleterre, d'où ses chansons sont très en demande.
Pierre Perpall, toujours actif et aussi énergique, donne régulièrement
des spectacles privés et tiendra l’affiche au Casino de Montréal ainsi que la
Place des Arts, comme chanteur et réalisateur dans ses revues musicales toutes
plus colorées les unes que les autres dont Sh…
Boom, Sh… Boom et Las Vegas à Québec,
dans lequel il reprend des succès des années 1950 et 1960. ♫♪¸.•*¨*•♪♫♪♥*♫♪♫¸.•*¨*•♥*♫♪¸.•*¨*•♪♫♪,♥*♫♪¸.•*¨*•♪♫•*¨*•.¸¸¸.•*¨*•♥*♫♫*•

<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Hello Friend! </span></h3>
<h3>Let me introduce mys.elf </h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I am Shari Elf</span></h3>
<h3>and <i>I LIKE MYSELF</i>
</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I'm an artist...musician...activist...raw food chef...life coach...fashion designer...creator of The World Famous Crochet Museum and co-creator of Art Queen in Joshua Tree...and I like being a girl.</span></h3>
<h3>And, in the words of Jesika von Rabbit, I am the founder of the I LIKE MYSELF movement in Joshua Tree, California.</h3>
<div>I believe life is funner when I like myself just the way I am, right now!  It's the crazy weird unique things about each of us that make us who we are and that really make us lovable. I have found it's much easier to like and love other people when I like and love myself first.  After personal experiences in my own life where I realized I was not behaving like someone who liked herself, I've done the turnaround and now I'm preaching the gospel of I LIKE MYSELF to anyone who has ears and heart to hear and feel.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Click on the youtube link below to hear the song! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I like myself, so you don't have to</div>
<div>I like myself, I'm down with me</div>
<div>I like myself, I'm in my spaceship</div>
<div>I like myself, I'm filled with me</div>
<div>What would Cher do? I don't care,</div>
<div>I'm way too busy with myself!</div>
<div>I'm excavating precious jewels, from deep inside</div>
<div>I'm filled with these. What would Shari Do?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I want more people to hear this message and open their minds to it's healing balm.  I sell I LIKE MYSELF t-shirts at Art Queen gallery in Joshua Tree.  There are people regularly telling me they can't wear an I LIKE MYSELF t-shirt.  Quite a few.  Why is the world in the current state of unbalance it is in?  In my view it's because we individually do not like ourselves.  The solution is simple.  If a few people open their minds about being nicer to themselves, my song and video will have done the work I  want them to do! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p>I like my mind, I like my style</p>
<p>I like my vibe, I'm good with me</p>
<p>I like my skills, I made my panties</p>
<p>I made 'em cuz, I like myself</p>
<p><i>(Jesika von Rabbit as Heidi Klum of Project Runway): </i></p>
<p>Designers, I invite you to take the unconventional panties challenge<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>I realized I needed a song with this theme that was showing up in my art a lot and always very popular but a song wasn't coming to me. Then I heard Yoko Ono's new dance club hit song ""Bad Dancer"", which she recorded along with a full album with  son Sean Lennon when she turned 80 last February. I realized my song had to be a fun dance song. Of course you want to dance when you are singing I LIKE MYSELF!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I am enough, I do enough, I have enough, I LIKE MYSELF</div>
<div>I like my sock, I like my shoe, I like me and I like you. (and I LIKE MYSELF)</div>
<div>I like my knees, I like my nose, I like my brain, I like my toes</div>
<div>I like my teeth, I like my armpit, I like my Elf, and I LIKE MYSELF</div>
<div>(Victoria Williams): she likes herself  I LIKE MYSELF  (Victoria Williams): she likes herself</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I went to garage band on my computer and worked out the sound I wanted and recorded a rough draft of the song. Then I asked Todd Rutherford Johnson and Jesika Von Rabbit of the Joshua Tree band Gram Rabbit to record my song in their studio.  I am a big fan of their music and I am always dancing when Jesika is singing.  I'm super excited about the hip hop dance song we recorded in their studio over the past 6 months.  I want this song and it's positive message to get stuck in everyone's head and psyche!  I want the video to be fun, colorful and playful and show lots of us crazy, fun-loving, care-free desert characters singing I LIKE MYSELF.... like we mean it!!!  I want it to spread my message, after all, I am the founder of the I LIKE MYSELF movement in Joshua Tree, California. </div>
<div>To spread the message of self-liking, we realized we need a video!  I'm thrilled that Jesika von Rabbit will be producing this video and she has introduced me to an amazing and colorful video director, Jessica Janos of Los Angeles (Jessica directed Jesika's recent video I'm Psychic, now available for public viewing! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLIr525ZKBM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLIr525ZKBM</a>). </div>
<div>We have completed the 4 day video shoot in Joshua Tree  (February 2-6, 2015) with the goal of releasing the video by Valentine's Day...Feb 14, 2015.  This is not gonna happen at this point but we hope to debut the video by the end of February! </div>

<div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>In the spirit of I LIKE MYSELF, I wanted to try something that made my soul happy, to get people involved in my crusade, to have a party to look forward to (we have really fun parties at Art Queen in Joshua Tree), to offer fun perks!  </div>
<div>Let's have a party!  The perks are tailored by me with the special flavor that most of my projects have: fun! community involvement and evolvement!  aura cleansing! dancing and live music at the video viewing party in March, 2015 at Art Queen in Downtown Joshua Tree, California! tasty snacks!  Dancing and playing at Art Queen on Thursday, February 5, when we do the group dancing and scenes with desert friends.  </div>

The Kittens are:  Shari Elf, JP Houston and Ryan Erskine.  We 3 Kittens spent one day a week for most of 2011 to record these 10 songs.  I am very happy with the album and so excited to share it with my fans.  $1000 will help pay for finishing the I LIKE MYSELF recording, mastering the entire album as well as replication of 500 CDs. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = $3000<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If we make more than our desired goals, I would love to pay Jessica and the crew more for their hard work and creativity and have more funds for the viewing party so we could pay another band or 2 to play (Daytime Moon has offered to play at the party). If we don't make all of our desired goals, we'll make it work, with priority being to pay the video director and video expenses.  <span><br/><br/></span>
</div>
<div>The running time of my campaign is 2 weeks so the funds will more quickly be available to the crew to finish this by our deadline.  This is a 14 day campaign, not a 30 day campaign so donate now if you believe in this cause!  Thank you for reading this far into my campaign!  : )  I like you! <br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><h3>Perks:</h3></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If you've ever been to Art Queen or my booth at the Joshua Tree Music Festival, you may have experienced one of my Complimentary or Complementary Aura Cleanses. </div>
<div>Get your aura cleansed and be bright and shiny and help our projects for $10!  </div>

<div>Or experience Dinner at Shari's, a $100 perk.  I love having dinner parties and have been complimented on my healthy and delicious cooking. I will lovingly prepare a homemade meal for you and other guests!  There will be lively and interesting conversation. </div>
<div>I was sitting here thinking, well, this is my campaign, what kinda things do I really LOVE to do?  I've had it in my mind it would be fun to offer a healing retreat, where a guest could stay in my airstream trailer and I will make fresh raw juices and raw healthy food and I'd share some of my many interests in the areas of health and well-being.  I've loved the idea of conducting mini personal health retreats that include raw food cooking classes, life coaching sessions with emphasis on balancing of your yin/yang energies and art and creativity class or coaching, basically, it's an I LIKE MYSELF retreat.  I'd love to take this kind of retreat myself, so I'm offering the ILIKEMYSELF Personal Retreat as a  $1000 perk.</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The impact I am envisioning!!!??? This video going viral and people all over the world singing I LIKE MYSELF!  In every language!  Here are a few examples  of people saying I LIKE MYSELF all around this cozy world:</div>

<div><span><span>Je me aimer! </span></span></div>
<div><span><span><span>我喜欢自己!</span></span></span></div>

<div><span><span><span>Maiṁ apanē āpa kī taraha!</span></span></span></div>
<div><span><span><span><br/></span></span></span></div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div><br/></div> <p>I believe in Jessica Janos and her brilliant creativity and her exceptional ability at deadlines!  I absolutely love the new video she created and directed for Jesika von Rabbit's song I'M PSYCHIC.  And she just quit smoking, so this project will help distract her and give her a positive thing to focus on!  It is fun to pay people for their creative brilliance! </p>
<p>It is fun to have a community party to celebrate the completion of our goals! </p>
<p>There is always the risk and challenge that we may not make our deadline goals.  Or that Jesika von Rabbit is asked to tour with Cher so can't play at the party.  Or that maybe I took one too many fashion risk!  No, cancel that, that's never a problem. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div><br/></div> <p>You can help by being nice to yourself!!  And LIKING YOURSELF!! I like you, what's not to like??!!  Please let your friends know if you like the sounds of this project. Help evolve the world to a place of bliss and happiness, one person at a time. <br/></p>

<p>Please say this out loud now:</p>
<p>SOMETHING GOOD'S GONNA HAPPEN TO ME TODAY!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>thanks for reading to the end : )  I like you! </p>

The running time of my campaign is 2 weeks so the funds will more quickly be available to the crew to finish this by our deadline.  This is a 14 day campaign, not a 30 day campaign so donate now if you believe in this cause!  Thank you for reading this far into my campaign!  : )  I like you! 


Perks:

If you've ever been to Art Queen or my booth at the Joshua Tree Music Festival, you may have experienced one of my Complimentary or Complementary Aura Cleanses. 
Get your aura cleansed and be bright and shiny and help our projects for $10!  
Come to the party and dance with fun people like yourself for just $20!   
Make a guest appearance in the video for $100! (you must be available on Thursday, February 5 to be in the video),  you don't have to donate to be in our big group scenes so don't let this perk stop you from showing up Thursday, February 5th to help with the party scenes. 
Or experience Dinner at Shari's, a $100 perk.  I love having dinner parties and have been complimented on my healthy and delicious cooking. I will lovingly prepare a homemade meal for you and other guests!  There will be lively and interesting conversation. 
I was sitting here thinking, well, this is my campaign, what kinda things do I really LOVE to do?  I've had it in my mind it would be fun to offer a healing retreat, where a guest could stay in my airstream trailer and I will make fresh raw juices and raw healthy food and I'd share some of my many interests in the areas of health and well-being.  I've loved the idea of conducting mini personal health retreats that include raw food cooking classes, life coaching sessions with emphasis on balancing of your yin/yang energies and art and creativity class or coaching, basically, it's an I LIKE MYSELF retreat.  I'd love to take this kind of retreat myself, so I'm offering the ILIKEMYSELF Personal Retreat as a  $1000 perk.

  The Impact

The impact I am envisioning!!!??? This video going viral and people all over the world singing I LIKE MYSELF!  In every language!  Here are a few examples  of people saying I LIKE MYSELF all around this cozy world:
Me gusto! 
أنا أحب نفسي! 
Je me aimer! 
我喜欢自己!
 Gusto ko ang aking sarili!
Olen itseni! 
אני אוהב את עצמי! 
Maiṁ apanē āpa kī taraha!
   Risks & Challenges
 I believe in Jessica Janos and her brilliant creativity and her exceptional ability at deadlines!  I absolutely love the new video she created and directed for Jesika von Rabbit's song I'M PSYCHIC.  And she just quit smoking, so this project will help distract her and give her a positive thing to focus on!  It is fun to pay people for their creative brilliance! 
It is fun to have a community party to celebrate the completion of our goals! 
There is always the risk and challenge that we may not make our deadline goals.  Or that Jesika von Rabbit is asked to tour with Cher so can't play at the party.  Or that maybe I took one too many fashion risk!  No, cancel that, that's never a problem. 

    Other Ways You Can Help
 You can help by being nice to yourself!!  And LIKING YOURSELF!! I like you, what's not to like??!!  Please let your friends know if you like the sounds of this project. Help evolve the world to a place of bliss and happiness, one person at a time. 
Also, I'd be grateful if you'd let me know if there are any typos or other kinds of errors in my writing. 
Please say this out loud now:
SOMETHING GOOD'S GONNA HAPPEN TO ME TODAY!

thanks for reading to the end : )  I like you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Hello Everyone, thanks for your interest in my
latest project!</b></p>
<p>I am getting ready to head into the studio for my latest project, “Dare to
Believe,” and would love your support. 
Music is a powerful thing and can change the world. Whether you're up or down, music lifts your
soul and spirit to new heights!</p>
<p><b>Project Background</b></p>
<p>My latest project, “Dare to Believe” is an exciting opportunity for me.  With this new EP, I look forward to having songs that will not only be heard on Inspirational Country Music affiliated
stations but will also be promoted to mainstream country radio stations.  This represents the next step in my career,
and an exciting step of faith to see what God has in store for me.</p>
<p><b>Where Your Support Will Go</b></p>
<p>All of the money from this campaign will go directly towards the recording costs
of my new project (i.e. production, studio time, mixing, mastering, musician
costs, etc.).  As a thank you, there are different gifts associated with your contributions.  They are all listed to the right.<br/></p>
<p><b>Personal Background</b></p>
<p>I have released two previous projects, “Where I’m Going (2011)” and “Life
From Scratch (2013)”.  I have had three
#1 songs on the Inspirational Country Music (ICM) charts, “It Ain’t Gonna Be
Like This Forever,” “I Feel Better When I Sing,” and “Livin’ In Today.”  In 2012, I won the ICM New Artist of the Year
Award and have been nominated three times for Female Vocalist of the Year.</p>
<p>I paid for my last two projects by working a ""day"" job. A few months ago though, I started doing music
full time. It was a big stretch of faith
as I had been working there almost ten years. Sometimes to move forward, you
have to step out into that great unknown.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and for all of your help! I appreciate it soooo much!</p>

</ol><p>To be brief and to the point, i. In the last 2 years, I have done quite a lot. I have come to the  realization that, without funding, I can not take the next step in my  career.  A lot of things need to happen:. A move to Atlanta, GA or Jacksonville, FL is needed to play more shows to build my fan base. Also, I need things that every budding DJ and producer needs;. Tthings like DJ headphones, studio headphones, studio monitors (audio and video), a new laptop (as mine has a fried motherboard), car repairs, food, and shoes that are not falling apart. A lot of head-desking, math, and  worrying about how to take the next step  followed. I want to make the best music I can. I just need the tools to do it!  As you will see, writing an album is very expensive. </p><br/><br/><p>What I need!</p><p>Here is as brief list of the items that I need to get to the next rung on the ladder. </p><p><a href=""http://www.sweetwater.com/wishlist/53495a74c3d70c146bc3855e0a24b90f"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sweetwater Shopping List! </a></p><ul><li><p><a href=""http://www.dell.com/us/p/xps-15-9530/pd?oc=fncwx1603b&amp;model_id=xps-15-9530"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dell i7 15"" display</a>. To be honest this is the most important part of the puzzle. With out a new laptop, there is no DJ'ing, new music, or new videos! With the high system demands of the hardware and software that I will be using, I need an i7 CPU with at least 16GB of RAM. The audio on board does not really matter as I have a <a href=""http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/KompAudio6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Native Instruments Komplete Audio 6</a> that I already own for an audio interface.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p><a href=""http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/Live9Suite-e/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ableton Live 9 Suite</a>. This is critical to arranging, DJ'ing, mixing, and remixing, Also, with Ableton Live 9 being the standard for production in the dance music scene, I will have a lot more opportunity for collaboration and remix work.</p></li></ul><ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/Reason7/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Reason 7</a>.  A huge part of my unique sounds come from this piece of software. I have years of custom loops, samples, sounds, and synths. All of my releases in the past have been done in Reason 5, Reason 7 provides a huge boost in productivity and quality of work flow.  </p></li>

With out the loyalty; of the DJ's, fans, and other supporters, I could not have made it to where I am with music. So I want to thank you up front for your support. In the last few years, I have done a great many things with music. Here is a short list of what I have done so far with literally no budget. :
Number 1 remix featured on  drumnbass.net (part of the EDM network 2013)
Headlined 2 different 24- hour parties in Jacksonville, FL 
Released a full- length album called  Exterminatus (Morbit Records 2012)
Released - Crush (Dirt, Lies, & Audio: BLACK 2012)
Released - Gravity Well (Dirt, Lies, & Audio: BLACK 2012)
Released - RIC DOLORE EP (Morbit Records 2013)
Released - Subver5ion - Vent (Ric Dolore Remix - DLA: BLACK 2012)
Released - Ric Dolore Promo Mix (DLA:BLK) - over 16k plays!
Released - Ric Dolore - DLAB Promo Mix 2 - over 9k plays!
Formed Drum N Bass trio  Devastate  in 2014.
To be brief and to the point, i. In the last 2 years, I have done quite a lot. I have come to the  realization that, without funding, I can not take the next step in my  career.  A lot of things need to happen:. A move to Atlanta, GA or Jacksonville, FL is needed to play more shows to build my fan base. Also, I need things that every budding DJ and producer needs;. Tthings like DJ headphones, studio headphones, studio monitors (audio and video), a new laptop (as mine has a fried motherboard), car repairs, food, and shoes that are not falling apart. A lot of head-desking, math, and  worrying about how to take the next step  followed. I want to make the best music I can. I just need the tools to do it!  As you will see, writing an album is very expensive. What I need!Here is as brief list of the items that I need to get to the next rung on the ladder. Sweetwater Shopping List! Dell i7 15"" display. To be honest this is the most important part of the puzzle. With out a new laptop, there is no DJ'ing, new music, or new videos! With the high system demands of the hardware and software that I will be using, I need an i7 CPU with at least 16GB of RAM. The audio on board does not really matter as I have a Native Instruments Komplete Audio 6 that I already own for an audio interface.Ableton Live 9 Suite. This is critical to arranging, DJ'ing, mixing, and remixing, Also, with Ableton Live 9 being the standard for production in the dance music scene, I will have a lot more opportunity for collaboration and remix work.
Reason 7.  A huge part of my unique sounds come from this piece of software. I have years of custom loops, samples, sounds, and synths. All of my releases in the past have been done in Reason 5, Reason 7 provides a huge boost in productivity and quality of work flow.  


Native Instruments Komplete 10 Ultimate.  This is the standard for EDM Music production. It's a must have! 

Toontrack Superior Drummer 2 This is used by top producers from around the world. You can do things with this that are not possible with real life drums and makes it an great tool for working with drum samples.
Sennheiser HD 380 Pro.  I can not DJ or make new music with out them. My last set of Sennheiser HD 280 headphones were destroyed in a small mishap. The HD 380 would be a very nice upgrade and give me a better understanding of the music that I am writing with out going to a huge studio.Novation Launchpad S. An integral part of my DJ setup. The LaunchPad S, allows amazing editing of music while a song is playing, and is fFully integrated into Ableton Live 9. I can do things like, chop, glitch, reverse, and stutter full songs or loops of music while iI am DJ'ing or even write songs live in front of a crowd.Novation Launch Control XL.  This will allow me to have control over the mix when DJ'ing better then plugging in to the house mixer. The  Novation Launch Control XL  is also fully integrated into Ableton Live 9. Controlling effects, cross-fading, and mixing music loops or songs is made possible when combined with two or more LaunchPad S’s.Yamaha HS8S. This is the industry standard for small project studios, and allows for a. Amazingly true reproduction of the bass sounds and kick drums in your songs; a. All of this with out the added expense of studio time. Yamaha HS7  Again, Yamaha monitors are the  industry standard for small project studios. They have a vVery flat response, meaning the sounds you make are truly heard while you are writing. IsoAcoustics ISO-L8R130 - Small, Pair. It would be a waste of money to not to have a way to isolate your expensive  Yamaha monitors from your desk. The vibration from the monitors changes the sound, s. So this is a needed accessory for the audio monitors. IsoAcoustics ISO-L8R200 Sub - Large, Single Unit. Just as above, you have to isolate the sub from the floor. This gives you the best performance and gets rid of that ""trunk rattling"" sound as your bass sounds vibrate the floor.How does this benefit the music?The intent is to push back at the cookie- cutter world that is becoming the Electronic Dance Music scene.

No more cookie- cutter music!
With your help, I will continue to provide top -quality, original songs and remixes.

<h3>Hi! I'm Beth Hamon, an independent Jewish musician based in Portland, Oregon.</h3>
<p>Some of you know my story already: a former bicycle mechanic-turned Jewish synagogue musician, songwriter and recording artist. It's not as simple or as glamorous at it sounds. Mid-life career changes can be financially, emotionally and spiritually demanding.<br/>But the results can be enlightening.<br/>In the five years since walking away from the bicycle industry, I've managed to travel across much of the USA, bringing my folk/roots Jewish music to communities ranging in size from 50 families to over 1,000. I've met amazing teachers and mentors along the way, and have been inspired by my experiences to give something back through my music.<br/><br/>So I've come up with a way to get my music out to more people, AND to promote community creativity and engagement:<br/><br/><strong>Presenting A Sliver In The Sky: an OPEN SOURCE Jewish Music Project.</strong><br/><br/><u>Here's how it works</u>:<br/><br/>-- I will record six to eight original, previously unreleased Jewish songs using nothing more than my voice and a guitar.<br/><br/>-- I will make lead sheets for each song available after you purchase a copy of the recording.<br/><br/>-- I will license the recording under <strong>Creative Commons</strong> (CC) -- this means if you buy one copy of the recording, you can then make and share other copies far and wide. All you're required to do is attribute the composer (that's me) each time you share my music.<br/><br/>-- You can then bring my song to your synagogue, camp or community center and create an arrangement based on your community's musical resources and desires.<br/><br/>-- In return, all that's required is that you provide me with a video or audio recording of your version of my song, send me a physical copy of the sheet music arrangement of it, and tell me when and where you used it. I want to see how your creativity interprets my song, and I want to know where my music travels!<br/><br/>-- If this really takes off -- and I have a hunch it might! -- then my ultimate goal is for this Open Source project to grow partnerships between me and your synagogue or camp community. Bring me out for a weekend as an artist/educator-in-residence, or have a video-conference with me. Together, we can brainstorm great musical ideas AND plant seeds for the future of creativity and communal engagement in Jewish communities across the country, through the gift of music!</p>
</div><div>
<p>This is why I'm calling this an <strong>Open Source music project</strong>.</p>
<p>It's similar to what the creators of Linux software intended: create the basic software, then invite users around the world who know how to code to update and upgrade functions and share them with each other, not only making the software better and easier to use but also creating an intentional community of people working together for a greater good.</p>
<p>And so it is with my project.<br/>Open Source Music is designed to bring people together to experiment with raw material and then to create their own sounds -- and build stronger community in the process.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>How does Open Source Music work?</strong><br/>1. It eliminates the middlemen (licensing houses, publishers, and record labels) through <strong>direct creation and distribution of the music by the composer</strong>.</p>
<p>2. It encourages <strong>direct creative collaboration between the composer and other musicians</strong>, building community.</p>
<p>3. It promotes the far more realistic ideal of getting one's music out there and heard, over an unrealistic expectation of high profits that are simply no longer attainable by most artists in <strong>a post-copyright world</strong>.<br/>(I know I'll get my head handed to me on this point by someone, somewhere; but I'm not worried. I believe Open Source is the future, and not only for computer programming.)<br/><br/>If it works, great.<br/>If it doesn't, that's okay too. At least I will have learned something.</p>
<p>I would love for you to become involved in this project, as a funder, and/or as a music director willing to put a toe in the experimental waters of Open Source Jewish music with me.<br/><br/>I'm keeping the fundraising, promotion and the actual recording very simple, both to make it more sustainable AND to make it more accessible.<br/>Please enjoy the video links provided in the campaign, check out the perks and decide for yourself if you'd like to be involved in what I believe is a very exciting way to grow new music -- and musical engagement -- in Jewish communities. I hope you'll agree that it's interesting and that you'll get involved.<br/>Thank you, and as always, Buckets of Peace -- Beth</p>

</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong> I began this project over a year ago recording on
New Years Eve, bringing in 2014.  After finishing recording in Spring of
2014, life swept me away to an Italian
Sculpture Garden
in Minnesota
where I married my love and I never got to mastering and duplicating my then
newly recorded album.  It has been over year and today listening again to
the mix, I know I NEED to put this album out! The band sounds amazing with lots
o soul and I'm proud and excited to share the music with you all.  In
order to do this I need your help so I can pay for the mastering
and printing of the album.  Please help me finish this project,
it's been a long time coming and I hope to share it soon!</p>
<p><strong>About Me: </strong>I am a singer-songwriter with a
gravelly, soul-pumping voice. I began playing guitar and singing during
my adolescent years.  My lyrics reflect on past struggles with love, urban
chaos, and longing for the wilderness while in the heart of city.  I
released my first full-length album <b><em>Sing it to Me</em></b> in September
2010. Launching my debut album Sing it to Me at the Hotel Utah Saloon in San Francisco, I
continued performing both solo and collaborating with other musicians including
singer-songwriter Erma Kyriakos, Paige and Chris Cotton. I recorded vocal
harmonies on Chris Cottons’ album New American Century Volume One. I
recorded my second album titled <strong>The Turn</strong> in 2011 with a full
band at Tiny Telephone Studios in San
  Francisco. After a trip to Belize summer
2013, I decided it was time to make a soul album and returned once
again to Tiny Telephone, working with James Riotto to record my third album <strong>Llegada</strong>.
</p>
<p> I had written most of the compositions over
the past couple of years as “folk” songs and found a new response to them while
travelling in Belize. 
With the absence of a real folk scene, most of the music I encountered was
rhythm-based, reggae, rap, and pop music.  When I sang for people
travelling around I received an intense emotional response, people recalling
music that reminded them of deceased family members or childhood.  I came
back to San Francisco
and decided to record this third album “Llegada” which means “arrival”,
honoring lost loved ones and a raw emotion that many have forgotten from the
days of childhood.</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>My costs</b>: The total costs of the first phase of this project were $9,275. Miraculously I was able to cover most of the cost using
my own savings. Now I need to cover the mastering and production of the
album.  </p><p><u>Your contribution covers:</u></p>
<p>•  Mastering of final project $900</p>
<p>•  Production of a limited edition hard copy CD $900</p>
<p>• Graphic Design/Album Art $500</p>
<p>•  Shipping costs/Indiegogo fees $200-$400</p>
<p><b>What I’ve spent so far :</b></p>
<p>•  Studio time, mixing, production fees 
$6000</p>
<p>•  Live musician fees $2500</p>

<div>Hey everyone!! First off, thank you so much for taking the time to check out this great project I'm working on! My name is Santo Hooligan but some of you may know me personally as Eric. I am born/raised in South Texas (y'all) but currently live in NYC to aggressively pursue my music career. I remember the moment I wanted to be a professional singer/artist/musician when I first listened to Selena when I was 7 years old. I have been singing since I was a child and recently in the past two years, I decided to FINALLY go after my passion and goals in music. I've been working very hard the past year on my craft, recording new music and it's time to get it out there! I've been  vocal training with the AMAZING Norma Garbo (Taylor Swift, Scissor Sisters, Kara DioGuardi, and many more), guitar lessons (NYC Guitar School) and recording with the very talented Craig Levy (producer), so I take my music career VERY seriously.</div>

<p>How serious am I about playing the bass you ask? I rehearse every day with my school orchestra, I play in my school's chamber strings, I have a small group lesson every week, I play in my school's Jazz Band two mornings a week, I have a private lesson each week and finally, I rehearse with the Barrington Youth Orchestra every Monday night. I am the first chair bass player in my orchestra and I recently auditioned and made I.M.E.A, an honors orchestra in my state.

I practice bass and piano everyday right after I finish my homework.</p>

<div>The trip to Israel is a 10-day trip that will take place over Passover and Easter in 2015. My airfare, hotel and some meals are included in the price of the trip.  Some of the places we will be visiting are Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, the Sea of Galilee, and the River Jordan. We will spend time practicing and performing with students from a high school for the performing arts as well as playing several other concerts. I look forward to performing many different styles of music, including American composers like Aaron Copland and Samuel Barber.

</div> <div>Most, if not all of the funds I'm trying to raise are going into the quality of the project. Nothing short of the best for these compositions.

This is a fund raiser for the first of the series.Most of the work is done, but to complete this project I have brought on an ace producer/engineer in Phil Harris from Nashville along with some very special guests to add some lovely color and orchestration to the final sound.What began in Brooklyn will end in Nashville and will jump start a brand new sound from yours truly!
 Most, if not all of the funds I'm trying to raise are going into the quality of the project. Nothing short of the best for these compositions. I'm enlisting the help of the wealth of talented session players and vocalists from Nashville to fill out the arrangements I've prepared and recorded.

I quit my job to follow my heart and my passions, to be the change I want to see happen in this world, which is a little Peace and a little Love in a world engulfed with mindless violence and hate, where holding hands and kissing and showing acts of love is condemned or deemed vulgar, where oppression happens on a larger scale, and where there are more and more people suffering from depression and anxiety because they are doing things they don't want to.</p>

<p>I am on a journey to all the 29 States of India.

<p>I began my journey on the 1st of January 2015 and have already visited 7 states but now terribly low on money because my earnings come from whatever I get from playing music on the streets and through whatever kind people donate. I use that money to fund my travels and for food and also to feed poor children on the streets where I perform since I share their space. It feels good to bring smiles on their faces.</p>

I lived in Nashville for 18 years before moving here. I was fortunate enough to work with some very fine, and well known, musicians while I lived in Tennessee. I have spent the last few years living very happily here in Tasmania. Most of that time writing songs and making a record of mostly my original songs. Throughout this period I have been getting my musician friends to help me with this project. In today's world they can record their tracks and send them to me. I have managed to accumulate some of the greatest musicians I have ever played with. Some of these have played on records most of you would have grown up with. Here are a few of them listed. <br/><br/>Meet the musicians:<br/><br/>Spooner Oldham (piano) - One of the original Swampers from Muscle Shoals. Has played on hundreds of hit songs by Aretha Franklin to Neil Young and too many to mention. <br/><br/>Mark T. Jordan (Hammond organ and piano) - Mark played on Van Morrison's Tupelo Honey record. Many tours with his as well. He also toured with Jackson Browne on his Pretender tour. As well as Lyle Lovett.<br/><br/>Mike McAdam (guitar) Mike is known as a top notch guitar slinger and played and recorded with Steve Earle on Copperhead Road. He has many many recording and touring credits. <br/><br/>Dann Sherrill (drums and percussion) - Dann is not only one of my best friends, he is one of the most gifted players and nicest guys you will ever meet. We have played on my records together including Summervilla-Work to do and both my solo records.  His knowledge of Afro-Cuban grooves to the old school rock and blues in unsurpassed by most out there. <br/><br/>Jim Brock (drums and percussion) - As I said I wanted to the best. Jim Brock is a legend in the Charlotte music scene and already was even when I began playing around there in the early 80s. His credits look like the greatest rock, folk and jazz artists in the world.<br/><br/>Rick Plant (guitar) - I met Rick very early on when I moved to Nashville. We did lots of playing and recording together. He was working with Buddy and Julie Miller when he moved from Nashville To Melbourne, Australia! So we are kindred spirits! He was about my favorite picker in town. <br/><br/>Danny Carter (vocals) - What can I say about Danny. I worked with Danny and Tim for 18 years. We are brothers through and through. He is one of the best songwriters and singers you will ever hear. I wouldn't think of doing a recording without him. <br/><br/>Tim Carter (banjo, mandolin, vocals) - Tim is known as one of the finest human beings you will ever know. He is also an astounding musician and recording engineer. I can safely say every record I have done would not be possible without him. He has guided me through each one with patience and encouragement. Tim has 4 Grammys on his wall to prove he is one of the best at what he does. <br/><br/>Richard Crooks - Legendary session drummer known for playing on Bob Dylan's Blood On The Tracks album. He worked with Dr. John for 20 years or so. I was lucky to be able to briefly befriend him when he moved to Key West. He was kind enough to play on a track for me. <br/><br/>Robert Bowlin - Robert is one of the most talented guys on the planet. He was a fiddler for Bill Monroe for several years. He is an amazing player all the way around. A good friend too and we have made many records together over the years, including two of mine.<br/><br/>As you can see there are great players and this is only a few of them. Most I have worked or recorded with and were chosen because of what they can bring to each particular song. <br/><br/>So you see we have the players and this is what we are asking for. The recording, cover illustration and graphic design are finished and paid for privately so the $10,000 I am looking to raise will pay for post production and manufacturing. Approximate costs below. <p></p><p>$1500 - Mixing</p><p>$1000 - Mastering</p><p>$1500 - 1000 CDs</p><p>$3000 - 200 Vinyl records</p><p>$3000 - Initial promotion via internet and print</p></div>","I am an American musician and producer now residing in Tasmania, Australia.
