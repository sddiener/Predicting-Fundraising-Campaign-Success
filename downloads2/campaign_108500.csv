<h3>Our Broken Health Care System</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511545085/lhzz84t3ge8vcgrhmh34.jpg"" src="""" style=""padding:12px;width: 125px;height: 250px;float: right;""/>     Health care in the United States is broken. We are caught in political gridlock where neither side cares what’s best for the average citizen, but only cares for their party’s platform, and the laws pushed by their major donors. With insurance companies and big pharmaceutical companies free to write their own rules in many cases, there is no accountability in the system. Treatment costs continue to rise, specialty drug prices have become outrageous, insurance premiums and deductibles are reaching unsustainable highs</p>
<p>     Health care horror stories are endless. Elderly couples are unable to afford the medicines they need. Young families are unable to cover the medical costs required to care for their children. The quality and availability of health care continues to decline as the costs continue to spiral up. Some reports indicate that over half of all bankruptcies are based on medical expenses. Government reports show that almost 20% of the US Gross Domestic Product is based on health care costs. We must regain control, or we will all suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>     It is not a matter of “if” you will be a victim of our broken system, but “when” and how badly you will be hurt.</p>
<h3>System Failures</h3>
<p>     The health care industry is guided by two major forces: legislators who pass laws and regulations; and providers who often adhere to business practices that are designed solely for their own short-term profitability, rather than the long-term good of society. When both legislators and big businesses neglect our needs as constituents and customers, we all suffer. There are countless examples of this. Here are just a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Unreasonable Drug Costs:</strong> Harvoni, a drug used to treat Hepatitis C, is sold in the United States for $94,000 for a 12-week supply. This same drug is available for around $200 in Japan; a licensed generic version is available for $1,200 in India; and Harvoni is available for $2000 in Korea. It costs approximately $100 to manufacture Harvoni. The first few months the drug was out, sales more than paid for all of its development costs, and has since made tens of billions of dollars in profit for Gilead, the manufacturer. This is only one example of many where pharmaceutical companies have no one to hold them accountable for predatory pricing.</li>
<li>
<strong>Skyrocketing Insurance Premiums:</strong> While health care premiums for small business group policies have seen modest increases the last several years, plans on the health care exchanges have increased close to 22 percent per year since their inception. At this rate, premiums have almost doubled in the last 3 years. These plans generally serve those who can least afford the increase, including the elderly who are not yet eligible for Medicare, as well as the poor and sick within our society. The average cost for health insurance for a family of four is now above $25,000 per year, and that doesn't include deductibles, co-pays or co-insurance.</li>
<li>
<strong>Special Interest Influence:</strong> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511394896/gkd5xz8cvvgeuus5ipj3.jpg"" src="""" style=""padding:12px;float: right;""/> Health care lobbyists contributed almost $280 million to their favored candidates’ campaigns in 2016, and spent over $500 million on convincing the legislators they bought and paid for to vote for the bills written for the benefit of their special interest groups. Include other benefits provided by special interest groups, such as advertising in favor of their chosen candidate, and the total is well over a billion dollars a year. Politicians have been bought and paid for by the health care industry with an endless stream of cash. Your $25 campaign contribution just doesn't carry much weight with your congressional representative by comparison. As we expose their conflict of interest, they will understand that they must pass laws that benefit the people, or we will replace them.</li>
<li>
<strong>Medicare Fails Our Seniors:</strong> Medicare was envisioned as a safety net for retiring seniors, but premiums are rising as fast or faster than Social Security increases. Few doctors will see new Medicare patients because of low reimbursement and billing complications, and Medicare drug costs are breaking the system.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The HCA Taskforce is on Your Side.</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511394220/bppsnfvtrbpuypuaagot.jpg"" src="""" style=""padding:12px;float: left;""/>      The Health Care Accountability Taskforce (HCA Taskforce) is a research and consumer advocacy group focused on restoring integrity and balance to the health care system. Our purpose is to gather and expose information allowing consumers to fully understand the problems related to health care: including ever increasing cost, declining service and the lack of availability for those who are least able to afford it. Armed with this information, and the combined voices of our members, we will have the power to force politicians and business leaders to act in the best interests of the health care consumer, rather than themselves and their political party.</p>
<h3>Strength in Numbers</h3>
<p>     The HCA Taskforce is dedicated to exposing the true problems in the health care industry, and mobilizing an army of like-minded individuals who want to take back control of our own health care needs. By building an organization with a powerful membership base, we will have the strength to make both government and big business pay attention to our needs. By exposing fraud, corruption, and conflicts of interest by our government leaders, we will be able to pressure the government to once again be a government “of the people, by the people, and for the people.” By exposing unethical business practices we will be able to ensure that businesses will deal fairly and ethically with the consumer either out of respect for the consumer, or fear of the prosecution since they will no longer own the law.</p>

We will publish our research to expose fraud and corruption wherever we find it and call on the media and our supporters to demand action. When the public becomes outraged, as it did with the Epi-Pen case a few years ago, we have the power to take action and see real changes take place. To make a difference, we must rise above partisan politics and never allow compromises that treat the surface but mask the hidden monster that still remains.</p>

<p>     We will retain doctors, lawyers, accountants, insurance specialists and others who understand the health care industry, but are not subject to their influence. With the support of our members we can turn the system around for ourselves, our children, the poor and the seniors who are suffering under the current system.</p>
<h3>Our Vision and Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>First Quarter 2018: </strong>Launch our initial membership drive and set up our new headquarters office.<br/>     Using the funds from this campaign, we will launch a membership drive that will focus on building a newsletter subscriber base of at least 25,000. From the pool of subscribers, we will enlist 10,000 as contributing members who will make average contributions of $25 or more per year. With this base, we will have membership funds coming in that will allow us to continue towards our ultimate goal of 100,000 contributing members and 250,000 newsletter subscribers. This membership base will cover our anticipated annual budget of $2.5 million.<br/>     To open up opportunities to receive support from private foundations and other charitable organizations, we will spin off a sister organization as a registered 501c3 non-profit organization for much of the research and educational efforts of the Taskforce.<br/>     In this quarter we will secure office space and hire a research journalist and a public relations director. Our focus will be to begin initial research and produce monthly newsletters with informative articles that do not require the in-depth analysis of medical and legal professionals. Producing regular newsletters will aid our public relations director in building our membership levels throughout the following quarter.</li>
<li>
<strong>Second Quarter 2018:</strong> Address excessive drug costs and continue to grow membership.<br/>As our membership increases in the second quarter of 2018, we will staff our legal and accounting team to begin analysis on underlying medical costs, especially drug and hospitalization expense. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511545740/rlx2gj1d6vkvrymu0uk7.jpg"" src="""" style=""padding:12px;height: 210px;float: left;""/>     Prescription drug costs are the largest slice of health care expenses at 20 percent; and these costs are expected to grow from 20 to 40 percent each year. We will focus on bringing to light drug pricing schemes that produce some of our most egregious examples of over-pricing such as Harvoni ($94,000 per treatment in the US, but only $2,000 in Korea) and Humira ($4,500 in the US, but only $1,000 in Europe for a twin-pack). Attacking this problem will provide the greatest relief of all the health care areas that we will focus on. It is also the easiest area to address. With enough pressure, the CEO’s of half a dozen companies could initiate a major reduction in their drug pricing almost overnight.<br/>     To segregate our political activities, we will spin off a sister organization as a registered 501c4 and / or a 527 organization for more direct political activity engaged in by the Taskforce.<br/>     With continued growth and more detailed research, we will begin issuing calls to action, and expand our membership base to 50,000 members.</li>
<li>
<strong>Third Quarter 2018:</strong> Expose political problems and continue to expand research areas covered.<br/>     In the third quarter of 2018, we will continue building our membership base to 75,000 contributing members. We will also bring on insurance and political specialists to lead our in-depth analysis of insurance policies and business models and the relationships between our politicians and the special interest groups that spend close to a billion dollars a year to control our political process. Attacking the problem of corrupt politics will be one of the most difficult. This will require a change of heart for almost every lawmaker in office; or making sure they are no longer in office after the next election.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fourth Quarter 2018:</strong> Finish building the leadership team with the addition of medical professionals and reach 100,000 members.<br/>     As we approach the end of the year, we will be looking at close to 100,000 contributing members. With full funding we will bring on our medical team to analyze treatment practices. Retaining medical specialists will require the largest increase in our salary expense, and are therefore held until last. With doctors in our organization, we can better address the viability of alternative treatments, defensive medical costs, and how the field of medicine is impacted by the various requirements imposed by the government and insurers.</li>

Additionally, Manon worked as the online high jewelry editor for the global private jet travel magazine, Elite Traveler, before launching her YouTube channel, Rare & Beautiful, where she interviews global fine jewelry designers and brands.Manon’s role as leader and influencer in the silver hair space began 11 years ago when she first started the transition from dyed black hair to her natural silver hair. Since then, she has enjoyed a growing number of Instagram followers, Pinterest pins and YouTube viewers because of her natural silver hair.Those of us who grew up in an era where owning our natural silver hair was taboo are ditching the hair dye to set our silver hair free . . . along with our schedules & pocketbooks.We are making an identity shift: we aren’t letting ourselves go – we're simply letting go. And we're rocking our own personal style in the process.We place a higher value on our own authenticity than we do on the opinions of others.We are confident, unique and comfortable in our own skin. We are rare & beautiful, and so is our hair.         CLARIFY is a sulfate-free and paraben-free gentle clarifying shampoo formulated especially for natural silver hair. This shampoo works triple-time, ridding hair of dirt build-up from environmental impurities, styling products, and chemicals found in water. CLARIFY leaves hair gently squeaky clean, easy to comb through, super shiny and smelling amazing. Directions: I use CLARIFY gentle clarifying shampoo at least once a week before toning my hair with AMPLIFY toning shampoo. I apply CLARIFY to my wet hair, making sure to work in the later evenly throughout my entire head of hair. I rinse well with warm water and repeat a second time to completely remove all environmental impurities as well as chemical and product build-up. During the second application, I keep the lathered shampoo in my hair for up to 5 minutes depending on how yellow my hair is: the more the yellow in my hair, the longer I leave it on my hair. After rinsing well, my hair is a little bit squeaky clean, super soft and a perfect canvas for the next step: AMPLIFY toning shampoo. XO Manon     AMPLIFY is a sulfate-free and paraben-free gentle purple toning shampoo formulated especially for natural silver hair. It's multifaceted vegetable protein-based complex, amino acid complex and intense purple pigmentation strengthen and protect hair from cuticle abrasion and breakage while neutralizing yellowing found in natural silver hair.  AMPLIFY leaves hair stronger, brighter, shinier and smelling amazing. Directions: I use AMPLIFY gentle toning shampoo at least once a week after clarifying my hair with CLARIFY clarifying shampoo. I apply AMPLIFY to my wet hair beginning with the ends, and work the lather through to the mid-crown of my head. I'll let the lather sit on my hair up to 10-15 minutes to really penetrate the hair shaft and neutralize the yellow strands. Usually, the newer hair growth at the scalp of my head isn't as yellow as the outgrowth of the rest of my hair, so I give more time to toning the lower parts and ends of my hair. Before rinsing, I put additional AMPLIFY on the crown of my head, working lather through to the scalp and throughout all of my hair, and then let it sit for a couple more minutes. After rinsing well, my hair is free of brassy yellow tones, it's super bright and shiny, and is ready for its final step: FORTIFY fortifying conditioner. XO Manon   FORTIFY CONDITION is a sulfate-free, paraben-free and nutrient-rich gentle conditioner formulated especially for natural silver hair. Fortified with multiple fruit and plant extracts, this luxurious, power-packed hydrating conditioner fortifies the hair with a high-tech delivery system that ensures the nutrients penetrate the hair cuticle, building strength from within while protecting the hair's surface. FORTIFY CONDITION leaves hair feeling silky soft, light-weight, full of volume and smelling amazing. Directions: I use FORTIFY CONDITION after using either AMPLIFY gentle toning shampoo or FORTIFY SHAMPOO. I apply FORTIFY CONDITION to my wet hair making sure to work in the conditioner throughout my entire head of hair. I rinse well with warm water, towel dry and style with my blow dryer. My multi-colored silver, gray and white strands look so vibrant and shiny, and my hair feels incredibly light, silky soft and smooth, and smells amazing. Yours will, too! XO Manon  FORTIFY SHAMPOO is a sulfate-free, paraben-free and nutrient-rich gentle shampoo formulated especially for natural silver hair. Fortified with multiple fruit and plant extracts, this luxurious, power-packed hydrating shampoo fortifies the hair with a high-tech delivery system that ensures nutrients deposit onto the hair and protect the hair. FORTIFY SHAMPOO leaves hair clean, silky soft and smelling amazing. Directions: I use FORTIFY SHAMPOO gentle shampoo 2 - 3 times a week depending on my work and travel schedule. I apply FORTIFY SHAMPOO to my wet hair making sure to work in the gentle, conditioning lather throughout my entire head of hair. I rinse completely with warm water, repeat the wash and rinse again. After the final rinse, my hair feels silky and clean, smells amazing and is ready for the final step: FORTIFY fortifying conditioner. XO Manon

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Welcome to the Universe where Black Womyn and Black Girls are actively healing! My name is Jessica F Morrison, and I have always wanted to host my own event and create an atmosphere of love, abundance, open arms, open invitation, and full acceptance. I also have not celebrated my birthday formally since I was a teenager. Life is soooo very short, and this year I am changing that absence of celebration! Not to mention I have ONE DECADE’s worth of original music and poetry on my phone and in my notebooks I am just BURSTING to share it for a room full of people.</p>
<p>This June, I just sunccessfilly completed, with distinction, my MFA in Acting graduate program at The Theatre School DePaul University ANNNND I was THE graduation speaker for well over 10,000 guests and world wide streaming. I have been moving so quickly through life that I haven’t even stopped to properly celebrate or share this accomplishment either.</p>
<p>With your investment, I will have the financial capital to make my dreams of sharing my (he)art with you and the rest of the world a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This Healing Concert will take place in Chicago. I need $800 total to book the space. The venue that I’ve fallen in love with has everything I need and requires a $200 deposit to secure the date. In my ideal world, the ULTIMATE birthday gift would be to call these people Saturday morning and put that $200 down for the date! The most promising weeks available are the 2nd or 3rd weeks in December. I chose this space because it has all of the equipment I need as well as being a flexible space AND includes a performance stage and (my dream) concert-lighting set up (YES, this is going to be a whole VIBE!)</p>
<p>As with most things I do, every guest that comes I want them to leave with something. So I am budgeting at least $300 to purchase and package (potentially personalized) gift bags for the guests who will be in attendance.</p>
<p>The remainder of the funds will go toward marketing, food, booze, paying the artistic talent (MC, Singers, musicians, front of house, DJ, photographers, videographers, etc.)</p>
<p>I have a special perk going on right now. Any one person, business or organization who donates, gifts, or invests $50 or more will recieve a hand written card from me with a personalized addressing! And if you’ve ever gotten a letter from me or heard any of my poetry, you KNOW I pour my heart out. You will be MOVED in a profound way!!! Plus, how many hand written letters are you receiving these days?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The concert is NECCESSARY right now because how many of us are living in fear? Fear of our own neighbors, traveling, turning on the news, afraid we are going to get “that” phone call, fear thinking about the future, fear of the past, or fear of not knowing how we will get through? We need PEACE! And if you can imagine a room FILLED with people of all backgrounds and stories in one space moving, speaking, singing, dancing, and laughing in joy, love, light, and celebration of life?! THAT IS THIS CONCERT! A HEALING space for ALL of us but especially for black women. Right now I speak to you humbly as a survivor of many things but especially sexual abuse because that is most presently affecting in my day to day life right now.</p>
<p>I heal best when I help other people heal through the stories of my own healing.</p>
<p>If you are new to me and my brand, firstly WELCOME! Also, I want to present my integrity to you. I have a proven record of being one of the MOST dynamic artists, speakers, and creators of this time and generation. I am a Billionaire in spirit and in practice, and I dedicate my life and I give you my word that I WILL GIVE BACK TO THE WORLD AS ABUNDANTLY AS GOD HAS BLESSED ME WITH GIFTS LOVE, LIGHT, and THE POWER TO HEAL AND CHANGE LIVES.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk, honestly, is being transparent and vulnerable about the fact that I don’t have the funds to do this myself. I have posted on social media word about throwing a “Birthday Concert”, but since graduating from my Master’s program, I have been struggling with finding balance in my life. I am juggling life and needs and my savings and I have been humbled so many times asking my parents for help to stay afloat. However, I don’t want my pride or my fear or finances to keep me from my destiny. I have a song in my heart to sing, and I know it resonates with the ? world.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute financially, I hope you don’t feel badly about it. Your time and your light mean the world to me. I would love to support you and encourage you on this life journey as well. There is more than enough room for ALL OF US to thrive. I hope you might consider contributing in these ways:</p>

During this time she had extreme awakening experiences which brought her to the fulcrum of her existence. These experiences left her with profound cosmic knowledge and, in the midst of it, she ""saw"" a Divine circular pathway which lies within all things, including the human body. Reborn into cosmic knowledge she understood that this roadway within must be maintained as it is also the path to well-being and happiness. Six years later, after cloaking this new way of seeing into today’s language, she restores the bridge between Divinity and matter by discovering our correspondence to the cosmos. With it she reintroduces a natural way of achieving balance which brings health, prosperity and wholeness. This is achieved through understanding a sacred code behind the Divine circle, a code that was interpreted by our ancestors which is known to us today as the zodiac.The Great Mother and Her Sacred Circle is a manual to understanding cohesiveness between the Divine and the material world, and a Divine system of mind/ body balancing. This balancing is achieved through tending to the sacred geometry within, whose very nature is described by the zodiac!In this manual you will find…
How your own system of energy flow (your mind & body) is geometrically symbolized by the cross.
A chart of archetypal images, known as the zodiac, and how they fundamentally represent a code of specific vibrations that directly correspond to your mind & body (your cross).
The art of systematically balancing your mind & body by using the zodiacs to form specific thoughts, actions, and words which vibrationally balance and heal.
Find over thirty diagrams and charts regarding the code and your own energy flow.
Develop a deeper connection to your inner self, with a step-by-step process on how to meditate for healing and transcendence.
Discover how your cross (your mind & body) relates to the cosmic whole by seeing a direct correspondence to earth and the galaxy which reveals an organic heritage.
Clearly ""see"" the Divine Mother through understanding the energetic way of the circle.
The Great Mother and Her Sacred Circle  will change the way you think about life and death, while restoring a lost system of energy management as the ancient, powerful images of the zodiac are revealed as the very earth-bound source which flows within you, taking you back to your original source - the Great Divine Mother.About MeMy name is Kel Rae and for over thirty years I was a seeker - someone plagued by the question, “What is life all about?”  I struggled for most of my life to find meaning, and I eventually found it, along with true abundance, by entering the inward realm of meditation.My interest in Divinity began at the young age of seven, as I had regular out-of-body experiences  along with other outer-worldly encounters. I quit grade school and left home to find greater truth and a deeper meaning to life - a sense of purpose. I explored much of the world yet still felt unfulfilled - nothing outward seemed to fill my heart, there had to be another way.At the age of forty I began to pray fervently to the Divine to explain why I was here. I was completely unprepared for what came next. Soon after a strange situation emerged and a voice within told me to meditate. Having no prior knowledge of meditation, the voice instructed me how. As my practice deepened I left the world to go out into the Mexican desert and go further into the dark journey. It was here that I experiencing tremendous terror, total agony and yet was sustained by unimaginable amounts of Divine love. After my experience with the Divine Mother the journey came to an end and I returned to the world to share my truth with those seeking it. This work, The Great Mother and Her Sacred Circle, is a vision of Divine knowledge coupled with years of research to reveal an energetic bridge which leads back to Divine connection with the Great Knower or Divine Mother. It speaks of love as the source of radiance that can heal and move all perceived barriers, and it breaks down a complex energetic system into a linear, easy-to-understand, geometric system of healing and health management that results in wellness, joy and a sense of purpose. It has taken thirty years to arrive at this knowledge and six years to process it. However, this material has only been assembled and funds are required in order to partner with an writer/ editor, and illustrator in order to complete this project and publish this manual so that all can have the benefits of this information.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>You may know me from teaching at FreeYogaTV, and I have loved being able to share my journey through getting my certifications in Yoga with you all.  After filming over 200 classes, I have started to realize that I want to go deeper into my understanding of the massage and anatomical aspect of mindful movement and somatic practices. </p>
<p>I came across a wonderful school, IPSB, here in Los Angeles that does a great job of combining martial arts and massage into an integrated healing practice.  They not only allow me the opportunity to complete my 550 hours required to become a certified massage therapist in California, but they also provide training in holistic practices that will seamlessly integrate all of my experience in healing modalities. This seems like a perfect marriage of some of the skills I already have to be able to branch out into this expertise.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I want to create comprehensive courses for our YouTube Channel that allow me to give you a deeper understanding of the anatomy in the body, and how to holistically provide yourself with an integrated healing practice. Through massage we will be able to go deeper than ever before in self-care and mind-body balancing. Only with your help will I be able to garner the knowledge necessary to create these classes for you.</p>
<p><br/>The first module of the certification costs two thousand dollars. So, I want to start there, and share what I learn in my schooling with all of you.  If we raise more; then I will be able to keep going, if we don’t, I will at least have 120hrs of information that I can turn into classes.</p>
<p><br/>As a huge THANK YOU to anyone who contributes toward this certification process; I want to offer downloads of your favorite FreeYogaTV classes, as well as one on one sessions with me.  Over the years, I have specialized in working with people through neurological trauma and injury.  I have worked with MDs, PTs, Massage Therapists, Psychotherapists, Chiropractors, Scientists, PHDs, MFAs, PTSD, trauma victims, post-surgery, directors, producers, high stress, low energy, depressed, happy but confused, and the list goes on, of wonderful people.  I want to provide you with access to all of this experience.  If you would like to learn about my sessions you can find testimonials and more information @ <a href=""http://www.stephenbeitler.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.stephenbeitler.com</a></p>
<p>If you can give three bucks I want to give you a huge thank you, and also put your name on a list of donors for our first class inspired by the massage therapy certification.  Just a little way to show my gratitude to this community that makes these videos possible.  It truly takes a village to get these things done, so I love to be able to watch those names go by after a class!</p>
<p>For a five dollar contribution I want to send you some of our meditation mp3s to download from our google drive.  These meditations range from our one minute and three minute guided breath meditations, to a couple of our older and longer visualizations. And, of course we will add your name as a donor.</p>
<p>For nine dollars I want to give you the opportunity to download your favorite FreeYoga class.  Often times we may find ourselves without an internet connection, and this way you  can have at least one FreeYoga class with you wherever you might be.  When our campaign finishes, you will just send me the url with the class you want, and I will email you a google-drive download.</p>
<p>For fifteen dollars I want to chat with you on the phone!  I have been talking with people about their practice for years.  I have it down to a science how to ask you about what you are working on, and what you would like to cultivate.  I will then be able to give you a specific prescription of practices and videos to help you on your way.  If you want to learn more about my sessions and read testimonials you can visit <a href=""http://www.stephenbeitler.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.stephenbeitler.com</a>    plus, you get the meditations, and your name as a donor.</p>
<p>For a twenty seven dollar contribution I want you to be able to download your favorite FreeYogaTV workshop!  If we find ourselves traveling, or maybe we want to burn a DVD to play the videos on the big screen, having these mp4s available means no more worries about an internet connection.  Plus, no more YouTube ads!  At the end of the campaign you can let me know which workshop you would like (30 days, 7 day warrior, 5 day retreat, Yin yoga) and I will send you a googledrive download. Plus, all the other rewards that came before.</p>
<p>For a fifty four dollar contribution I want to sit with you in a one on one video session.  I have been doing these video sessions for many years, and being able to see you, no matter where you are in the world, and watch your body move; gives me a great window into your practice.  I am able to very quickly give you pointers and advice on how to holistically integrate your movement vocabulary, and somatic understanding, to uncover your subconscious habitual patterning.  Every thought, emotion, and experience is lodged in our bodies, but usually we can't 'see' it.  It takes this outside perspective to give us the birds eye view necessary to uncover these poisonous habits.  To learn more about my sessions you can go to <a href=""http://www.stephenbeitler.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.stephenbeitler.com</a>     and, of course, you get all the previous rewards.  Which, includes a phone conversation, so we will be able to chat on the phone first to get an idea of where you want to go, and then hit the ground running in our video conferencing.</p>
<p>Our highest contribution is for a full session with me.  I have been doing these one on one sessions for years, and they give us the opportunity to do a complete overhaul of your nervous system.  We are able to pull from all of my experiences, and I am able to give you hands-on adjustments.  I am able to help you to feel all the places in your body that your conscious mind has forgotten about, or that you can't seem to let go of.  We will move through your entire system in ways that we rarely get the opportunity to experience.  You can find out more @ <a href=""http://www.stephenbeitler.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.stephenbeitler.com</a>  If you don't live close enough to have a session in person you can also trade this in for two video sessions (for a total of 3 sessions, since you get all previous rewards)  or, if you would like to wait until I am a certified massage therapist, you can trade this in for two massage sessions with me.  Any way you would like it, you will also get all previous rewards, so downloads, a phone conversation, and a video session, so that when we meet in person we can take off with full throttle. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you follow me on YouTube, then you know that I always teach from my own experience.  This certification program would open up a whole new area of exploration where we would be able to delve into the therapeutic aspects of touch and self-massage.  We would be able to combine our yoga asana with a myriad of self care practices.  I would be able to expand your understanding of the anatomy and the integration necessary for a healthy nervous system, not just from the Yogic point of view, but also combining the knowledge of a massage therapist.</p>
<p>Growing FreeYogaTV from an idea in my head to the almost 11k subscribers we have now, would not have been possible without all of your support.  I once asked my teacher ""Why teach?""  I really didn't want to be a teacher; and he told me that is exactly why I could.  It is only through teaching that we are able to truly know if we understand something completely.  Learning this new modality will give me another ocean of knowledge that I can then distill and pass on to all of you.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I am going to put $2,000 of my own money into the first module in order to garner the knowledge that I believe will continue to help our community grow.  If that is all that we are able to afford, then that is all the knowledge I will gain.  But, I believe that with the strength of this community, and the beauty of this wonderful modern world in which we have crowd funding, it just might be possible for this kid from a tiny town in South Carolina who grew up with nothing, to keep reaching for the stars.</p>

You may know me from teaching at FreeYogaTV, and I have loved being able to share my journey through getting my certifications in Yoga with you all.  After filming over 200 classes, I have started to realize that I want to go deeper into my understanding of the massage and anatomical aspect of mindful movement and somatic practices. 
I came across a wonderful school, IPSB, here in Los Angeles that does a great job of combining martial arts and massage into an integrated healing practice.  They not only allow me the opportunity to complete my 550 hours required to become a certified massage therapist in California, but they also provide training in holistic practices that will seamlessly integrate all of my experience in healing modalities. This seems like a perfect marriage of some of the skills I already have to be able to branch out into this expertise.
 

What We Need & What You Get
I want to create comprehensive courses for our YouTube Channel that allow me to give you a deeper understanding of the anatomy in the body, and how to holistically provide yourself with an integrated healing practice. Through massage we will be able to go deeper than ever before in self-care and mind-body balancing. Only with your help will I be able to garner the knowledge necessary to create these classes for you.
The first module of the certification costs two thousand dollars. So, I want to start there, and share what I learn in my schooling with all of you.  If we raise more; then I will be able to keep going, if we don’t, I will at least have 120hrs of information that I can turn into classes.
As a huge THANK YOU to anyone who contributes toward this certification process; I want to offer downloads of your favorite FreeYogaTV classes, as well as one on one sessions with me.  Over the years, I have specialized in working with people through neurological trauma and injury.  I have worked with MDs, PTs, Massage Therapists, Psychotherapists, Chiropractors, Scientists, PHDs, MFAs, PTSD, trauma victims, post-surgery, directors, producers, high stress, low energy, depressed, happy but confused, and the list goes on, of wonderful people.  I want to provide you with access to all of this experience.  If you would like to learn about my sessions you can find testimonials and more information @ www.stephenbeitler.com
If you can give three bucks I want to give you a huge thank you, and also put your name on a list of donors for our first class inspired by the massage therapy certification.  Just a little way to show my gratitude to this community that makes these videos possible.  It truly takes a village to get these things done, so I love to be able to watch those names go by after a class!
For a five dollar contribution I want to send you some of our meditation mp3s to download from our google drive.  These meditations range from our one minute and three minute guided breath meditations, to a couple of our older and longer visualizations. And, of course we will add your name as a donor.
For nine dollars I want to give you the opportunity to download your favorite FreeYoga class.  Often times we may find ourselves without an internet connection, and this way you  can have at least one FreeYoga class with you wherever you might be.  When our campaign finishes, you will just send me the url with the class you want, and I will email you a google-drive download.
For fifteen dollars I want to chat with you on the phone!  I have been talking with people about their practice for years.  I have it down to a science how to ask you about what you are working on, and what you would like to cultivate.  I will then be able to give you a specific prescription of practices and videos to help you on your way.  If you want to learn more about my sessions and read testimonials you can visit www.stephenbeitler.com    plus, you get the meditations, and your name as a donor.
For a twenty seven dollar contribution I want you to be able to download your favorite FreeYogaTV workshop!  If we find ourselves traveling, or maybe we want to burn a DVD to play the videos on the big screen, having these mp4s available means no more worries about an internet connection.  Plus, no more YouTube ads!  At the end of the campaign you can let me know which workshop you would like (30 days, 7 day warrior, 5 day retreat, Yin yoga) and I will send you a googledrive download. Plus, all the other rewards that came before.
For a fifty four dollar contribution I want to sit with you in a one on one video session.  I have been doing these video sessions for many years, and being able to see you, no matter where you are in the world, and watch your body move; gives me a great window into your practice.  I am able to very quickly give you pointers and advice on how to holistically integrate your movement vocabulary, and somatic understanding, to uncover your subconscious habitual patterning.  Every thought, emotion, and experience is lodged in our bodies, but usually we can't 'see' it.  It takes this outside perspective to give us the birds eye view necessary to uncover these poisonous habits.  To learn more about my sessions you can go to www.stephenbeitler.com     and, of course, you get all the previous rewards.  Which, includes a phone conversation, so we will be able to chat on the phone first to get an idea of where you want to go, and then hit the ground running in our video conferencing.
Our highest contribution is for a full session with me.  I have been doing these one on one sessions for years, and they give us the opportunity to do a complete overhaul of your nervous system.  We are able to pull from all of my experiences, and I am able to give you hands-on adjustments.  I am able to help you to feel all the places in your body that your conscious mind has forgotten about, or that you can't seem to let go of.  We will move through your entire system in ways that we rarely get the opportunity to experience.  You can find out more @ www.stephenbeitler.com  If you don't live close enough to have a session in person you can also trade this in for two video sessions (for a total of 3 sessions, since you get all previous rewards)  or, if you would like to wait until I am a certified massage therapist, you can trade this in for two massage sessions with me.  Any way you would like it, you will also get all previous rewards, so downloads, a phone conversation, and a video session, so that when we meet in person we can take off with full throttle. 
 

The Impact
If you follow me on YouTube, then you know that I always teach from my own experience.  This certification program would open up a whole new area of exploration where we would be able to delve into the therapeutic aspects of touch and self-massage.  We would be able to combine our yoga asana with a myriad of self care practices.  I would be able to expand your understanding of the anatomy and the integration necessary for a healthy nervous system, not just from the Yogic point of view, but also combining the knowledge of a massage therapist.
Growing FreeYogaTV from an idea in my head to the almost 11k subscribers we have now, would not have been possible without all of your support.  I once asked my teacher ""Why teach?""  I really didn't want to be a teacher; and he told me that is exactly why I could.  It is only through teaching that we are able to truly know if we understand something completely.  Learning this new modality will give me another ocean of knowledge that I can then distill and pass on to all of you.
 

Risks & Challenges
I am going to put $2,000 of my own money into the first module in order to garner the knowledge that I believe will continue to help our community grow.  If that is all that we are able to afford, then that is all the knowledge I will gain.  But, I believe that with the strength of this community, and the beauty of this wonderful modern world in which we have crowd funding, it just might be possible for this kid from a tiny town in South Carolina who grew up with nothing, to keep reaching for the stars.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:

As always; sharing, liking, telling a friend helps so much more than you might realize!

With $25,000, Project LETS will be able to expand our Peer Mental Health Advocate (PMHA) program to more college campuses, and continue to provide programming, resources, and crisis support to young folks in need.

<li>Providers contribute to stigmas against certain disorders and experiences </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Story of LETS</h3>
<p>In October 2009, our founder, Stefanie Kaufman, lost her friend <a href=""http://www.letserasethestigma.com/our-story/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Brittany Marie Petrocca</strong></a> to suicide. In the aftermath, it was clear that the East Meadow, New York community was devastated and hurting. However, her high school shut down conversations about it-- they even refused to put a photo of Brittany in the yearbook. At the age of fourteen, Stefanie and her friends did not know how to <strong>grieve in this culture of silence.</strong></p>
<p>It was at this point that Stefanie, who was quietly living with her own mental illness, began to work to erase the stigma by holding educational workshops, pushing for policy reform, and encouraging conversations about mental health and suicide. In 2013, she incorporated Project LETS as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization in the state of New York.</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Upon coming to Brown University, Stefanie soon recognized the same culture of silence around issues of mental health. She had negative experiences with mental health resources on campus-- with long wait times and a fragmented system of care, it was difficult to access help. The lack of transparent policies made students with mental illness frightened to seek care from university counseling centers. Students didn’t know if they would be <a href=""http://www.today.com/video/mental-health-policies-at-universities-draw-increasing-concern-708889155922"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">involuntarily hospitalized</a> or even <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2013/11/04/univ-medical-leaves-unhelpful/3359813/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">forced to withdraw from school</a> if they expressed concerns about suicidal ideation and self-harm to a therapist-- so many students struggled in silence. </p>
<p>In response, Project LETS launched their pilot PMHA program at Brown University in the fall of 2015.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The PMHA Program - Our Solution</h3>
<p>Our <a href=""http://www.letsatbrown.org/pmhas"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peer Mental Health Advocate Program</a>, or PMHA program, addresses the need for additional mental health supports specifically for college students. We train college students with mental illness to advocate for other students with mental illness by forming one-on-one partnerships, where they provide long-term peer support, and help struggling students access useful and culturally relevant resources.</p>
<p>           <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492766439/trdrnbefgkk4umf4amhz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>We are the experts: </strong>When trying to solve this problem of lack of support for college students with mental illness, many people look to outsiders with specific credentials-- but we believe that a solution lies with the very people who experience the problem. They are the ones who have the expertise and the skill sets to solve it-- nobody knows these issues better than the people who are hurt by them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Innovative: </strong>It is mutually beneficial for both the PMHA and the mentee. The peer counselor can help their mentee more easily navigate the mental health care system, if they so choose, and can provide them with a consistent source of social support where they can be honest about their experiences with their illness. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Internalized stigma: </strong>There is immense power in that “me, too,” moment, especially when you’re dealing with a topic that so often makes people feel very vulnerable. This is really unique because so often, we’re told that our mental illnesses are only something to overcome, and aren’t anything to be proud of. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>It already exists: </strong>Students are already widely utilizing it, but it’s informal peer support-- meaning that these conversations are happening behind closed doors, and aren’t regulated, with people who might not be trained and who might not have ever encountered these issues before. <strong>We are not therapists, and do not claim to be</strong>; peer support is a different kind of mental health care entirely, and has been proven especially helpful for people with stigmatized illnesses.</p></li>

<h3>The Campaign</h3>
<p>For the past 4 years, Project LETS, Inc. has run on a very small budget.<strong> </strong>Stefanie started the organization with $3,000 of her own money.<strong> </strong>Through a few grants, individual donations, and merchandise sales,<strong> LETS has been able to fully fund our programs without any major financial assistance.</strong> We’ve provided all of our services for free. But in order to expand, we need more help.</p>
<p><strong>With your donations, Project LETS will: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Expand our PMHA Program to 10-15 more universities, including RISD, URI, Penn State, Yale, and Columbia.</li>
<li>Continue staffing our chat-based crisis line with peer counselors.</li>
<li>Continue to offer free, web-based <a href=""http://www.letserasethestigma.com/peer-counseling/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>peer counseling services</strong></a> to individuals who can’t seek treatment due to insurance complications, financial limitations, family issues, stigma, geographic location, inaccessibility, cultural differences, and many other barriers.</li>
<li>Work toward our long-term goal of opening a <a href=""http://www.peerrespite.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>peer respite center</strong></a> + mobile crisis units, all staffed by peer counselors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Project LETS, Inc. has elevated the voices of students and young adults living with mental illness, or neurodiverse experiences. We don’t believe in being a “voice for the voiceless” — <strong>we believe that everybody has a voice, but that many are silenced.</strong> Your contribution goes directly towards ensuring that the narrative of marginalized voices is out there, front and center. Our passion is palpable, our troublemaking is fearless, and our voices are loud and proud together in the face of adversity.</p>

<h3>Who we are and why?</h3>
<p>Kennae Miller, owner of Transformation Yoga.</p>
<p>    Kennae was born in Frankfurt, Germany in a strong military family and was raised in Colorado Springs, CO where her father completed his military career and her family planted their roots. While living in Colorado and being exposed to many different experiences and forms of art she discovered yoga as a junior in high school. Initially lured by the invitation of a free class for relaxation as she navigated her teenage years she enjoyed the calmness of mind a yoga practice brought for her. It was only after the beginning of her parent’s difficult divorce was she able to observe and benefit in different aspects of life, from focus to self-inquisition, stemming from a yoga practice. Kennae credits the practice of yoga as the only place she could go to just be herself and relax her mind.</p>
<p>    In Spring 2005 she enlisted in the United States Air Force and as she traveled around the country, found stability in continuing her yoga practice. As Kennae approached motherhood in 2012, she dreamed of having more freedom outside of wearing a uniform where her individuality and desire to serve others could be of better use. She recalls in 2013 Tweeting, that she would become a Yoga Instructor and own a yoga studio. In 2015 she completed her Yoga Alliance compliant 200-hour teacher training at Hawaii Yoga Institute on the island of O’ahu, Hawaii. Since then she has continued her career development and training in Gentle Yoga, Race Based Trauma Injury, Yoga and Social Justice, Restorative Yoga, Body Positivity, Yoga Nidra, Usui Reiki and various other healing modalities of yoga and meditation. She is also a former police officer and medical assistant and the wife to Retired United States Air Force Spouse and mother of two.  </p>
<p>Here is what she has to share about Transformation Yoga. </p>
<p>    Transformation Yoga is important to me because as much as it is not about me, I too will be able to gain access to tools to assist in my personal journey as I make it available to others. Yoga spaces have strong manufactured marketing that tells certain people and communities that yoga is not for them and this is or is not what a yogi looks like. Because of this it leaves out so many communities especially communities of color (without tokenism), bigger bodies, older bodies, and the communities that could use the tools yoga and other healing modalities have to offer. Oftentimes people are trained to believe access to something like yoga or meditation is a luxury and everyone is not privileged to it. </p>
<p>    ""So why don't studios make classes a price where people can afford to attend?"" Between the overhead cost and expenses to run a studio (double or triple that for being in a specific area where your demographic has access to economic resources) most yoga teachers do not make a living doing this work. In fact, most yoga teachers never make $30k annually, which extends them to driving all over town to offer these tools in multiple studios and off-the-path locations just to be able to bring home a working wage. We also have to acknowledge access to capitol to open business doors, which is difficult to obtain especially if you are not what the ""ideal"" market tells these investors you should look like. </p>
<p>    ""Don't make excuses, start where you can. Try community centers, Recreation outlets, gyms."" Unfortunately because yoga is a $290 billion industry everyone in some way is trying to tap into the yoga market whether that is having classes with cats, selling their own version of yoga equipment, or presenting one clothing brand over another. With so many people seeing yoga as a market for making money and having funding to market what they believe yoga to be, it is difficult for real teacher and those that live this lifestyle to do the real work of yoga. At one point I was teaching 18 classes all over town in different locations and at each place was expected to teach for free, teach for the cost of minimum wage, teach in unsafe ways and conditions and leave out the real yoga. Yes, in some locations in an effort to not offend anyone (although yoga is pretty universal) teachers are instructed to not use Sanskrit words, to not wear particular clothing, or play specific music. Would we ask a doctor to perform surgery but leave her or is brain at home and use the hospital issued one? We don't believe so, this is why we need our own space so there are no limitations on the creativity, arts, and healing that can take place. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>    We need our own facility, where our teachers are no longer running around town to offer these tools to the communities that can benefit most from them. Our facility needs to offer a space for the attendees of these communities to bring their children into the same loving and holistic environment without feeling reprimanded because they did not have access to childcare or an after school program and instead have to not attend classes. We will hire locally and utilize local and eco-sustainable products first and only out source when neccessary. </p>
<p>    We need to ensure our doors will stay open. Pause for a moment and reflect on how many yoga studios used to exist here in the lowcountry and have since closed their doors. We believe in the work we are doing and the lives that are touched and transformed by each and every class we teach and offer but we also know each class is one opportunity to pull back the layers of introspection and it is important class participants are able to come back and continue doing their individual work so we can go out into the communities to serve from our healed and compassionate hearts not our ego perspectives. </p>
<p>    What can you expect out of this, a community where everyone is community. Where regardless of gender identity, race background, or religious belief people can come together in their differences and celebrate our collective humanity. Transformation Yoga is and will always walk the path of being of service to the community whether in volunteering, donations, bringing accessibility to the forefront, utilizing our voice and platform to speak for others and amplifying the voice of others and listening when someone else would be better served to speak. If we do not raise enough funds, we will keep trying. We will not give up and look for something else because we are driven by purpose and service, and we know opening these studio doors is not about us, its about the people. If by an act of God, we are unable to live out this life given purpose we will donate all of the raised funds to Fresh Future Farm (go check them out). </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>    This work is so important to the collective of humanity because in times like these, crucial times we should be able to gather together for the collective voice of humanity, yet how can we do so when we are disconnected from our own hearts and belief. Somewhere many of us have sacrificed compassion and love for profits and fame which has resulted in hate crimes across the country, family separations, media bias in reporting crimes against women and the LGBTQ+, and even the #MeToo movement. We believe through the use of tools like yoga and meditation we are called to action to reconnect with ourselves and in reconnecting within taking a position of notice and action for others. </p>
<p>   We are not the best at asking people to review us, we are not driven and motivated by Facebook 'Likes' or Instagram Followers but we would encourage you to find one of our students and ask them why they come back? What difference their lives have had since attending any of our classes and if you are really curious try one class and tell us for yourself. Then share that with others. We know there is someone somewhere that has far more training and certifications, who plays different music, maybe even looks different than us and wears better clothes but we are just about serving because it isn't about us. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>    We are sure to have some challenges and are prepared to conquer them. My career in the Air Force led me into a career of meeting deadlines, problem solving, and making it happen to carry out the mission no matter what obstacles were presented and this studio would be no different. We could face competition, but this is the very least of our concern. We are not interested in taking clients away from any other studios or competing to be #1, we only want to serve the communities that WE are meant to serve. Just like churches, there are many and people can choose which resonates with them, yoga studios are the same. </p>
<p>    Funding is our biggest challenge and here we are asking you to help us. We will raise enough funding to not only open our doors but to pay our teachers well, have all of our equipment, legal fees, insurance, lease, and utilities covered for at least our first year. This will allow us to focus on serving the people and solidifying our community roots to ensure we are able to keep our doors open in the following years. </p>
<p>    To serve the populations we need to serve we have to be incredibly strategic in our approach. We want our doors to open in Goose Creek so we are able to serve the Cane Bay, Goose Creek, Berkeley County side of Summerville and Moncks Corner. With our doors open there we will be able to offer remote classes at a satellite location in North Charleston. This is will allow us to keep our doors open as well as offer accessible classes in the community. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>    We know our mission will be in hearts and minds and some will not be able to give monetary donations but we would still love your help and support. You can share our campaign, attend any one of our classes, tell your family or friends instead of purchasing another gift, apron, or item that may not be used or re-gifted to send in a donation on your behalf.</p>

Kennae Miller, owner of Transformation Yoga.
    Kennae was born in Frankfurt, Germany in a strong military family and was raised in Colorado Springs, CO where her father completed his military career and her family planted their roots. While living in Colorado and being exposed to many different experiences and forms of art she discovered yoga as a junior in high school. Initially lured by the invitation of a free class for relaxation as she navigated her teenage years she enjoyed the calmness of mind a yoga practice brought for her. It was only after the beginning of her parent’s difficult divorce was she able to observe and benefit in different aspects of life, from focus to self-inquisition, stemming from a yoga practice. Kennae credits the practice of yoga as the only place she could go to just be herself and relax her mind.
    In Spring 2005 she enlisted in the United States Air Force and as she traveled around the country, found stability in continuing her yoga practice. As Kennae approached motherhood in 2012, she dreamed of having more freedom outside of wearing a uniform where her individuality and desire to serve others could be of better use. She recalls in 2013 Tweeting, that she would become a Yoga Instructor and own a yoga studio. In 2015 she completed her Yoga Alliance compliant 200-hour teacher training at Hawaii Yoga Institute on the island of O’ahu, Hawaii. Since then she has continued her career development and training in Gentle Yoga, Race Based Trauma Injury, Yoga and Social Justice, Restorative Yoga, Body Positivity, Yoga Nidra, Usui Reiki and various other healing modalities of yoga and meditation. She is also a former police officer and medical assistant and the wife to Retired United States Air Force Spouse and mother of two.  
Here is what she has to share about Transformation Yoga. 
    Transformation Yoga is important to me because as much as it is not about me, I too will be able to gain access to tools to assist in my personal journey as I make it available to others. Yoga spaces have strong manufactured marketing that tells certain people and communities that yoga is not for them and this is or is not what a yogi looks like. Because of this it leaves out so many communities especially communities of color (without tokenism), bigger bodies, older bodies, and the communities that could use the tools yoga and other healing modalities have to offer. Oftentimes people are trained to believe access to something like yoga or meditation is a luxury and everyone is not privileged to it. 
    ""So why don't studios make classes a price where people can afford to attend?"" Between the overhead cost and expenses to run a studio (double or triple that for being in a specific area where your demographic has access to economic resources) most yoga teachers do not make a living doing this work. In fact, most yoga teachers never make $30k annually, which extends them to driving all over town to offer these tools in multiple studios and off-the-path locations just to be able to bring home a working wage. We also have to acknowledge access to capitol to open business doors, which is difficult to obtain especially if you are not what the ""ideal"" market tells these investors you should look like. 
    ""Don't make excuses, start where you can. Try community centers, Recreation outlets, gyms."" Unfortunately because yoga is a $290 billion industry everyone in some way is trying to tap into the yoga market whether that is having classes with cats, selling their own version of yoga equipment, or presenting one clothing brand over another. With so many people seeing yoga as a market for making money and having funding to market what they believe yoga to be, it is difficult for real teacher and those that live this lifestyle to do the real work of yoga. At one point I was teaching 18 classes all over town in different locations and at each place was expected to teach for free, teach for the cost of minimum wage, teach in unsafe ways and conditions and leave out the real yoga. Yes, in some locations in an effort to not offend anyone (although yoga is pretty universal) teachers are instructed to not use Sanskrit words, to not wear particular clothing, or play specific music. Would we ask a doctor to perform surgery but leave her or is brain at home and use the hospital issued one? We don't believe so, this is why we need our own space so there are no limitations on the creativity, arts, and healing that can take place. 
 

What We Need 
    We need our own facility, where our teachers are no longer running around town to offer these tools to the communities that can benefit most from them. Our facility needs to offer a space for the attendees of these communities to bring their children into the same loving and holistic environment without feeling reprimanded because they did not have access to childcare or an after school program and instead have to not attend classes. We will hire locally and utilize local and eco-sustainable products first and only out source when neccessary. 
    We need to ensure our doors will stay open. Pause for a moment and reflect on how many yoga studios used to exist here in the lowcountry and have since closed their doors. We believe in the work we are doing and the lives that are touched and transformed by each and every class we teach and offer but we also know each class is one opportunity to pull back the layers of introspection and it is important class participants are able to come back and continue doing their individual work so we can go out into the communities to serve from our healed and compassionate hearts not our ego perspectives. 
    What can you expect out of this, a community where everyone is community. Where regardless of gender identity, race background, or religious belief people can come together in their differences and celebrate our collective humanity. Transformation Yoga is and will always walk the path of being of service to the community whether in volunteering, donations, bringing accessibility to the forefront, utilizing our voice and platform to speak for others and amplifying the voice of others and listening when someone else would be better served to speak. If we do not raise enough funds, we will keep trying. We will not give up and look for something else because we are driven by purpose and service, and we know opening these studio doors is not about us, its about the people. If by an act of God, we are unable to live out this life given purpose we will donate all of the raised funds to Fresh Future Farm (go check them out). 

The Impact
    This work is so important to the collective of humanity because in times like these, crucial times we should be able to gather together for the collective voice of humanity, yet how can we do so when we are disconnected from our own hearts and belief. Somewhere many of us have sacrificed compassion and love for profits and fame which has resulted in hate crimes across the country, family separations, media bias in reporting crimes against women and the LGBTQ+, and even the #MeToo movement. We believe through the use of tools like yoga and meditation we are called to action to reconnect with ourselves and in reconnecting within taking a position of notice and action for others.

</div><div>
<h3>THE HEADQUARTERS</h3>
<p>Our business has previously been located in two small historic homes with guesthouses in downtown Phoenix (super cute! see below). We’ve happily operated out of four buildings on our little compound, but now we’re ready to rise like Phoenixes.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535741116/njkiyil7uaaedr5lxa2g.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>After months of research, we purchased our own commercial space and got the keys on September 6th!</p>
<p>Centrally-located, it’s one block north of the Melrose District, a hip, growing strip of local shops, coffeehouses + restaurants.</p>
<p>Our 15,000 sq ft historical building has good bones, but there are some necessary updates + repairs that are high cost. We need a new roof, a fresh coat of paint, concrete floor polish, and other improvements.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535743681/hhd3jrkju11u5lzb4ahw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>THE BIG LEAP</h3>
<p>Our team is amazingly talented at making beautiful things + experiences.</p>
<p>And -- owning commercial real estate is a huge leap for us.</p>
<p>We’ve never been motivated by money. Our motivation has always been to bring more peace into people’s lives + reconnect them with their full potential. But in order to benefit more people, we need to take this risk.</p>
<p><i>Honestly, it's the boldest move I’ve made in my entire life. </i></p>
<p>We’re excited to use this building to bring to life our apothecary + store, weekly “happy hours” with mood-boosting beverages and other multi-sensory events and workshops. We’ll offer botanical bodywork treatments and flower ceremonies and experiences.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHY THIS MATTERS</h3>
<p>We live in a fast-paced world, glued to our smartphones + computers. Over a third of us have trouble sleeping every single night. Stress is a constant, with 1 in 5 American adults on medications for stress and over 7 million kids on medications for ADHD.</p>
<p>Wifi signals + cell phone towers are sending unprecedented levels of electromagnetic activity coursing through our bodies, every minute.</p>
<p>We don’t spend enough time in nature to rebalance all of that. But flower elixirs bring nature to you.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this matter?</strong> <i>Because w</i><i>hat we do really works.</i></p>
<p>Within hours or days of implementing flower elixirs, you experience less irritation. Life becomes smoother. Stress begins to dissolve. You sleep more soundly. Overwhelming emotions get softer and lessen. You notice a sense of perspective and relief.</p>
<p>Over time, you let go of relationships that don’t work, form new ones that do, open more fulfilling career paths, and do things with joy that you used to be afraid of. Resilience is unveiled, self-limiting beliefs dissolve and your talents begin to shine. Your dreams awaken. You become the best version of you.</p>
<p><strong>In short, our flower elixirs accelerate the process of getting you from where you are to who you want to be.</strong></p>
<p>During my international studies of flower essences, I was taught that if even 3% of the world’s population is taking flower elixirs, it will change the outcome of the future for the better.</p>
<p>From the beginning, that has been our goal. We intend to create a worldwide ripple effect of happiness.</p>

I’m Katie Hess, founder of LOTUSWEI. I’ve been working with flower elixirs for the last 18 years, having started creating products 10 years ago. I’m the author of Flowerevolution + I’ve been teaching meditation + awareness practices for 12 years.
As the world’s leading floral apothecary LOTUSWEI has been featured in O, The Oprah Magazine, The New York Times, the LA Times + more.

Our goal is to bring our flower essences into worldwide awareness, so that this powerful, sustainable tool of transformation can help people everywhere lead the freest, best version of their lives.What we know is that when prepared in a certain way, every flower on the planet has a unique effect on us as humans, and these flower elixirs are little-known, but fast-acting + effective.
Through our work, we reconnect people with their inner power, beauty + creativity using nature’s kindest remedy: flowers.
We hand-collect flowers all over the planet to make the most sustainable, gentle + effective botanical remedy for emotional wellness.
We help thousands of people around the world experience more happiness, clarity, peace + better sleep with flower elixirs, mists, oils + rituals.

LOTUSWEI is not just about bottles of elixirs - we invite you into our world of pivotal experiences and memorable events, workshops + retreats.We’ve hosted Flowerlounges in Singapore, New York City, San Francisco, Vancouver, Phoenix, Seattle, Minneapolis, Portland, Boston, Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia.
Flowerlounges are multi-sensory events designed to awaken all your senses so that you can let go of tension + rest in a state of beingness. Enjoy flower mandalas, flower libations + bites infused with mood-boosting elixirs, positive vibes, sparkly people and wakefulness practices.
As leaders in flower essence education, we published an interactive, choose-your-own-adventure flower elixir book and a flower card deck that demonstrate how flowers reflect your greatest potential for inner exploration. We also host the Flowerlounge Podcast with listeners in over 60 countries, featuring experts in wild + non-conventional fields of expertise.

UPLEVELING
We've purchased a commercial building that’s 8x larger than our current location. Home to our new headquarters, it’s allowing us to expand our business exponentially AND we’re creating a wellness hub in Phoenix, Arizona.
Here’s what we’ll do:

OPEN OUR FIRST EVER BRICK + MORTAR APOTHECARY:Experience our multi-sensory products and get a flower reading that will reflect back to you what's happening in your life + how flower essences can help.

HOST FLOWERLOUNGE EVENTS + WORKSHOPS:Attend multi-sensory events, botanical + awareness workshops and weekly meditation + tai chi classes + salsa dance parties.

PROVIDE BOTANICAL + FLOWER ESSENCE TREATMENTS:Enjoy out-of-the-box healing techniques using botanicals, fresh flowers + an apothecary of flower essences + aromatherapy. More relaxing than a massage.

FEATURE NATIONAL WELLNESS EXPERTS AS PART OF OUR PHOENIX WELLNESS HUB:Meet experts: Acupuncturists, Astrologers, Intuitives, Creatives, Poets, Monks + Nuns, Bodyworkers + Martial Artists.

HOST UNDERGROUND FLOWERLOUNGE ""HAPPY HOURS"":Think: ‘Speakeasy’ (but it’s all legal!) for flower elixirs + personal growth with elixir-infused sparkling tonics in our tea lounge inside the LOTUSWEI lab.

THE HEADQUARTERS
Our business has previously been located in two small historic homes with guesthouses in downtown Phoenix (super cute! see below). We’ve happily operated out of four buildings on our little compound, but now we’re ready to rise like Phoenixes.

After months of research, we purchased our own commercial space and got the keys on September 6th!
Centrally-located, it’s one block north of the Melrose District, a hip, growing strip of local shops, coffeehouses + restaurants.
Our 15,000 sq ft historical building has good bones, but there are some necessary updates + repairs that are high cost. We need a new roof, a fresh coat of paint, concrete floor polish, and other improvements.


THE BIG LEAP
Our team is amazingly talented at making beautiful things + experiences.
And -- owning commercial real estate is a huge leap for us.
We’ve never been motivated by money. Our motivation has always been to bring more peace into people’s lives + reconnect them with their full potential. But in order to benefit more people, we need to take this risk.
Honestly, it's the boldest move I’ve made in my entire life. 
We’re excited to use this building to bring to life our apothecary + store, weekly “happy hours” with mood-boosting beverages and other multi-sensory events and workshops. We’ll offer botanical bodywork treatments and flower ceremonies and experiences.

WHY THIS MATTERS
We live in a fast-paced world, glued to our smartphones + computers. Over a third of us have trouble sleeping every single night. Stress is a constant, with 1 in 5 American adults on medications for stress and over 7 million kids on medications for ADHD.
Wifi signals + cell phone towers are sending unprecedented levels of electromagnetic activity coursing through our bodies, every minute.
We don’t spend enough time in nature to rebalance all of that. But flower elixirs bring nature to you.
Why does this matter? Because what we do really works.
Within hours or days of implementing flower elixirs, you experience less irritation. Life becomes smoother. Stress begins to dissolve. You sleep more soundly. Overwhelming emotions get softer and lessen. You notice a sense of perspective and relief.
Over time, you let go of relationships that don’t work, form new ones that do, open more fulfilling career paths, and do things with joy that you used to be afraid of. Resilience is unveiled, self-limiting beliefs dissolve and your talents begin to shine. Your dreams awaken. You become the best version of you.
In short, our flower elixirs accelerate the process of getting you from where you are to who you want to be.
During my international studies of flower essences, I was taught that if even 3% of the world’s population is taking flower elixirs, it will change the outcome of the future for the better.
From the beginning, that has been our goal. We intend to create a worldwide ripple effect of happiness.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Slim and Trim Snacks is launching the first-to market raw, vegan, gluten-free,  ketogenic and Whole 30 compliant cauliflower cracker that combines nutrients, flavor and texture into one amazing snack that is beneficial for everyone.  It’s made from cauliflower, sunflower, flax, pumpkin and sesame seeds as well as herbs and spices and there is absolutely no inflammatory ingredients like wheat, flour, oil, sugar, flour, grain or preservatives used in its making.   Slim and Trim Snacks’ mission is to promote health and wellness one snack at a time, and the introduction of “Classic Cauliflower Cracker” serves to bear that out.  </p>
<p>Contributors who help Slim and Trim Snacks - a small, under-capitalized start-up – bring this unique product to market will, in essence, help to revolutionize the snack market where products are now made that focus on both taste and nutrients and not their mutual exclusivity. Needless to say, nutritious products that taste good are a win-win for the consumer in every respect.</p> <p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Slim and Trim Snacks would like to semi-automate its current manufacturing operations to facilitate the production of these unique crackers.  To scale our operations and produce the crackers in volume we need to purchase a specific machine that will cut and sheet them in large volume.   As a result, we are seeking to raise $15,000 to help with the machinery’s purchase and any inevitable retrofitting that will need to be done to make it fully functional.</p>
<p>The perks we have designed are all premised on promoting health and wellness.</p>
<p>Even though we have signed up for the option of partial funding with Indiegogo which means that we will still receive our contributions if we do not meet our goal, it will be a huge disappointment and will substantially delay the time-frame we've earmarked to bring this unique product to market.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Part of our intent is to secure the support of the American Diabetes Association as well as the national Celiac support group for these unique crackers as they don not have any refined carbs, or grain and as a result would be a perfect snack or mini-meal for the Type 2 diabetic or individual struggling with gluten intolerance, digestive or gut issues.   It is absolutely vital that we bring this breakthrough product to market, so that it can make a meaningful difference in the healthier choices that are available on the supermarket shelves as consumers become more accepting of and are demanding greater plant-based choices.    </p>
<p>Though we already produce raw, vegan, gluten-free kale chips that are currently sold in select Whole Foods Market stores in the north east, that operation is very small  and with it we are pitted against many competitors in a very fragmented field where there are a few large competitors and hundreds of small ones.  By creating a unique and distinguishing, second product line like the cauliflower cracker, we intend to be the first to market with this product in an environment where consumers are demanding and seeking more nutritious snack choices.  And since we have already gotten a commitment from Whole Foods Market to retail it in their stores, we only now need to focus on the process of bringing it to market as soon as is practicable.</p>
<p><strong>Risk &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The risks and obstacles we may face on the way to achieving our goal is competition and lack of capital.  If we do not raise enough funds to scale the product the way we would like, it could delay the process of scaling the product and carve out our own market share.  With that delay, we  could then face the risk of enormous market pressure from competitors.  So as a practical matter, not having enough capital prevents us from semi-automating our production facilities which is key to achieving economy of scale and allow us to exercise greater flexibility in pricing.  Therefore, the success of this campaign - that is achieving our goal - is absolutely crucial.  </p>
<p>Through my business partner and husband who is a mechanical engineer and who specializes in helping companies realize greater production and operating efficiency through proven methods like lean manufacturing, we believe that Slim and Trim Snacks is well-positioned to scale the brand once we have secured the targeted funding.</p>
<p>If we do not have enough funding to purchase the equipment that we need outright, then the contingency plan is to source and retrofit used machinery - a more time-consuming endeavor. </p> <p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>

<p><i>note: there are several videos with more information, click the thumbnails under the main video.</i></p>
<h3>A Brief Backstory</h3>
<p>Its not often that I have put out a call for help, as my aspiration throughout this earthwalk is to serve all of you, to restore the well-being of earth's precious biosphere, and to uplift the destiny of humankind. </p>
<p>As such, I have happily shouldered a weight of responsibility for greater good, and given my energy and days to endeavors that inspire me as worthy and honoring of the divinity within and beyond, efforts that vow reverence to the sanctity of life and the beautiful heart of kindness within you and I and all.</p>
<p>I have all too often taken upon myself to exert my body to its very limit to further my vision for humankind or that of another, often working physically at the threshold of my capacity while creating functional infrastructure and restoring ecosystems to harmony and fruition. And I have suffered multiple injuries to both knees as a consequence of the hazards I have faced, and have now used up the capacity of my knees to so much as support my body weight.<br/>So presently I am confined to a wheelchair for mobility, unable to stand up, let alone tend our gardens, walk in nature, or climb the stairs to the  sanctuary space I so consciously created for the coming together of soul kin for meaningful purpose and sharing of wisdom, for the making of music, and co-creation of sacred devotional space.</p>
<p>Until now, I have never felt the opportunity to sustain a focus on regeneration of the tissues in my knee joints that have served me so well, even as I have suffered much pain for some decades as I have continued to give of myself wholeheartedly and bodily. For the past 20 years I have been riding on grace to empower my ability to mobilize upon my devotions in spite of the severity of the injuries and pain. That grace is now used up, no longer sufficient to keep me standing in my convictions in a physical sense. No longer allowing me to walk my talk so to speak.  A poignant milestone on my journey, and a fulcrum for my way of life that directs me to turn my attention inward to regenerate and heal the cartilage, bone surfaces and ligaments in my knees that have been all but used up.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges that my current physical limitation poses, I remain happy and inspired, deeply grounded in an inexhaustible trust in the larger vision, and in the capacity of my body to heal. I have been postponing all too long the healing process that my knees are so deserving of, as they have served me so well and I have asked so much of them. So it is really a relief that I can now feel full permission to focus my days on regenerating the tissues, and re-orienting my way of life to a more balanced, inward, and restorative energetic. </p>
<h3>Past Injuries and Years of Wear &amp; Tear</h3>
<p>Here I am in a disabled state, having suffered several severe injuries to both knees in decades past, where only partial healing occurred before returning to an active, highly physical way of life; working the land, building structures, organizing community events, and giving of myself to whatever worthy project came before me. And so as I continued my hard working way of life on damaged knees, the deterioration of the joint tissues continued, gradually worsening over the years. I have been living with ongoing pain for a couple of decades and gradually losing capacity while still staying highly active and functional, but finally I've reached a threshold where the tissues in both of my knees have deteriorated to the point where I am unable to walk. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>I'm On Track For Stem Cell Therapy</h3>
<p>I'm so very fortunate to be positioned well for healing my knees.We an amazing orthopedic doctor here in Ecuador who offers natural regeneration therapies and cutting edge stem cell treatment. Dr. Chiriboga is a wonderful doctor, and I'm so happy to have someone with such a highly informed and compassionate consciousness leading my healing process. He has confirmed that I am a good candidate for the stem cell procedure, and he has me on a program of preparatory protocols for the lead up to the treatment. The cellular environment inside my knee joints needs to be in a receptive and regenerative state in order for a stem cell injection to take well and initiate the tissue rejuvenation, and my nervous system needs to be cleared of residual trauma from the past accidents and injuries to be knees. A couple months of neural therapy, orthomolecular intravenous antioxidants and anti-inflammation compounds, homeopathy, physiotherapy, and tissue regeneration supplements are serving to shift the energetics of my knees from acute inflammation and edema to a relaxed and receptive healing mode. In january I will receive stem cell injections in both knees. Dr. Chiriboga will extract some of my own stem cells from the bone marrow in my pelvis and also some fat tissue from my abdomen, with which he will prepare and inject the stem cell concentrate directly into the joint cavity in both knees. The stem cells, being undifferentiated and having the pristine genetic coding for every tissue in the body, will induce the deteriorated joint tissues to regrow into a healthy and youthful state.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>A Year of Tissue Regeneration</h3>
<p>The stem cell tissue regeneration, like any natural process, occurs slowly over a longer timeframe.</p>
<ul>
<li>3 months after the stem cell injections, I will return to Dr. Chiriboga to receive platelet rich plasma injections in both knees. He will extract some blood from my arm and then process it to remove the red and white blood cells, and use the remaining plasma, rich in growth factors, for the injections. This will invigorate the stem cells to continue regenerating the joint tissues.</li>
<li>6 months after the stem cell injections, the joint regeneration is assessed and depending on the level of progress, further treatments will be scheduled. Often it takes 2 or 3 stem cell injections to recover serious joint deterioration over the course of a year or 2.</li>
<li>During the regeneration process, I will have ongoing physiotherapy to continue strengthening the leg muscles, increasing the range of motion, and get me up and walking again. Occasional sessions of other therapeutic modalities such as cranial sacral, reflexology, bowen therapy, and arun touch will also be part of my healing process.</li>
<li>Daily hydrotherapy (alternating hot &amp; cold water) and a regimen of stretches and gentle exercises will support the tissue regeneration while increasing flexibility and strength.</li>
<li>I will also be taking various nutraceutical supplements and botanical preparations throughout the process to augment the tissue regeneration.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Transitioning Our Mode of Offerings</h3>
<p>Suzannah and I have been hoping for an opportunity to focus our time and energy creating online educational resources. We have such a wealth of inspiring content to share, and while we love gathering folks here at Canción del Corazón center for uplifting retreat programs, it is clear that we can also extend our outreach much further by having more of an internet presence and having our retreat content in video, webinar, blog, and podcast formats so it can easily go out to the world. Our hope is that many more people will then find us and if they resonate with our offerings, they can make use of our knowledge and experience to inspire their own activation of their deeper callings.</p>
<p>During the coming year of my healing process, I will not be in a position to contribute to the running of the center and our usual means of income to cover our overhead and living costs in the way that I normally do. So we are needing to scale back our programs, and by doing so, will be creating time and space to move forward with our aspirations to create our online educational resources. Your contribution, in addition to helping us meet the substantive medical costs, will also be supporting us to do this work.</p>
<p>If you are inspired by our way of life and the offerings we share, then through supporting us to make our resources available online, you will have opportunity to receive ongoing access to them and continue to connect with us in that way, and you'll be collaborating with us to contribute the uplifting inspirations to the world.</p>

<h3>We'll Be Forever Grateful For Your Support</h3>
<p>Any level of generosity that you feel to offer up will be deeply appreciated and is so very kind and helpful. I hope that empowering me to walk again and giving Suzannah and I this opportunity to take our collective vision to a higher level of outreach will return unforeseen grace and opportunities toward your own soul callings and way of life.</p>

A Brief Backstory
Its not often that I have put out a call for help, as my aspiration throughout this earthwalk is to serve all of you, to restore the well-being of earth's precious biosphere, and to uplift the destiny of humankind. 
As such, I have happily shouldered a weight of responsibility for greater good, and given my energy and days to endeavors that inspire me as worthy and honoring of the divinity within and beyond, efforts that vow reverence to the sanctity of life and the beautiful heart of kindness within you and I and all.
I have all too often taken upon myself to exert my body to its very limit to further my vision for humankind or that of another, often working physically at the threshold of my capacity while creating functional infrastructure and restoring ecosystems to harmony and fruition. And I have suffered multiple injuries to both knees as a consequence of the hazards I have faced, and have now used up the capacity of my knees to so much as support my body weight.So presently I am confined to a wheelchair for mobility, unable to stand up, let alone tend our gardens, walk in nature, or climb the stairs to the  sanctuary space I so consciously created for the coming together of soul kin for meaningful purpose and sharing of wisdom, for the making of music, and co-creation of sacred devotional space.
Until now, I have never felt the opportunity to sustain a focus on regeneration of the tissues in my knee joints that have served me so well, even as I have suffered much pain for some decades as I have continued to give of myself wholeheartedly and bodily. For the past 20 years I have been riding on grace to empower my ability to mobilize upon my devotions in spite of the severity of the injuries and pain. That grace is now used up, no longer sufficient to keep me standing in my convictions in a physical sense. No longer allowing me to walk my talk so to speak.  A poignant milestone on my journey, and a fulcrum for my way of life that directs me to turn my attention inward to regenerate and heal the cartilage, bone surfaces and ligaments in my knees that have been all but used up.
Despite the challenges that my current physical limitation poses, I remain happy and inspired, deeply grounded in an inexhaustible trust in the larger vision, and in the capacity of my body to heal. I have been postponing all too long the healing process that my knees are so deserving of, as they have served me so well and I have asked so much of them. So it is really a relief that I can now feel full permission to focus my days on regenerating the tissues, and re-orienting my way of life to a more balanced, inward, and restorative energetic. 
Past Injuries and Years of Wear & Tear
Here I am in a disabled state, having suffered several severe injuries to both knees in decades past, where only partial healing occurred before returning to an active, highly physical way of life; working the land, building structures, organizing community events, and giving of myself to whatever worthy project came before me. And so as I continued my hard working way of life on damaged knees, the deterioration of the joint tissues continued, gradually worsening over the years. I have been living with ongoing pain for a couple of decades and gradually losing capacity while still staying highly active and functional, but finally I've reached a threshold where the tissues in both of my knees have deteriorated to the point where I am unable to walk. 

I'm On Track For Stem Cell Therapy
I'm so very fortunate to be positioned well for healing my knees.We an amazing orthopedic doctor here in Ecuador who offers natural regeneration therapies and cutting edge stem cell treatment. Dr. Chiriboga is a wonderful doctor, and I'm so happy to have someone with such a highly informed and compassionate consciousness leading my healing process. He has confirmed that I am a good candidate for the stem cell procedure, and he has me on a program of preparatory protocols for the lead up to the treatment. The cellular environment inside my knee joints needs to be in a receptive and regenerative state in order for a stem cell injection to take well and initiate the tissue rejuvenation, and my nervous system needs to be cleared of residual trauma from the past accidents and injuries to be knees. A couple months of neural therapy, orthomolecular intravenous antioxidants and anti-inflammation compounds, homeopathy, physiotherapy, and tissue regeneration supplements are serving to shift the energetics of my knees from acute inflammation and edema to a relaxed and receptive healing mode. In january I will receive stem cell injections in both knees. Dr. Chiriboga will extract some of my own stem cells from the bone marrow in my pelvis and also some fat tissue from my abdomen, with which he will prepare and inject the stem cell concentrate directly into the joint cavity in both knees. The stem cells, being undifferentiated and having the pristine genetic coding for every tissue in the body, will induce the deteriorated joint tissues to regrow into a healthy and youthful state.

A Year of Tissue Regeneration
The stem cell tissue regeneration, like any natural process, occurs slowly over a longer timeframe.

3 months after the stem cell injections, I will return to Dr. Chiriboga to receive platelet rich plasma injections in both knees. He will extract some blood from my arm and then process it to remove the red and white blood cells, and use the remaining plasma, rich in growth factors, for the injections. This will invigorate the stem cells to continue regenerating the joint tissues.
6 months after the stem cell injections, the joint regeneration is assessed and depending on the level of progress, further treatments will be scheduled. Often it takes 2 or 3 stem cell injections to recover serious joint deterioration over the course of a year or 2.
During the regeneration process, I will have ongoing physiotherapy to continue strengthening the leg muscles, increasing the range of motion, and get me up and walking again. Occasional sessions of other therapeutic modalities such as cranial sacral, reflexology, bowen therapy, and arun touch will also be part of my healing process.
Daily hydrotherapy (alternating hot & cold water) and a regimen of stretches and gentle exercises will support the tissue regeneration while increasing flexibility and strength.
I will also be taking various nutraceutical supplements and botanical preparations throughout the process to augment the tissue regeneration.


Transitioning Our Mode of Offerings
Suzannah and I have been hoping for an opportunity to focus our time and energy creating online educational resources. We have such a wealth of inspiring content to share, and while we love gathering folks here at Canción del Corazón center for uplifting retreat programs, it is clear that we can also extend our outreach much further by having more of an internet presence and having our retreat content in video, webinar, blog, and podcast formats so it can easily go out to the world. Our hope is that many more people will then find us and if they resonate with our offerings, they can make use of our knowledge and experience to inspire their own activation of their deeper callings.
During the coming year of my healing process, I will not be in a position to contribute to the running of the center and our usual means of income to cover our overhead and living costs in the way that I normally do. So we are needing to scale back our programs, and by doing so, will be creating time and space to move forward with our aspirations to create our online educational resources. Your contribution, in addition to helping us meet the substantive medical costs, will also be supporting us to do this work.
If you are inspired by our way of life and the offerings we share, then through supporting us to make our resources available online, you will have opportunity to receive ongoing access to them and continue to connect with us in that way, and you'll be collaborating with us to contribute the uplifting inspirations to the world.

We'll Be Forever Grateful For Your Support
Any level of generosity that you feel to offer up will be deeply appreciated and is so very kind and helpful. I hope that empowering me to walk again and giving Suzannah and I this opportunity to take our collective vision to a higher level of outreach will return unforeseen grace and opportunities toward your own soul callings and way of life.
may kindness grace your days...

<h3 align=""center""><strong>Support our Purpose</strong></h3>
<p>The main aim of the project is to create a free online course of mindfulness to enhance Home-schooling experience in Latin America during the pandemic crisis. We like to help Latin American parents and children with advice, tips, recommendations, and exercises adapted to their social and cultural environment. The project is a way to help Latin American people to face the emotional pressure of home-schooling and child care at home, while they are facing the stress of economic and social difficulties.</p>

<h3 align=""center""><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We will strengthen parenting and child education in Latin America, teaching online mindfulness practices through a website and social networks. Our main aim is to help people in Latin American cities but also remote places affected by poverty and violence. We want to assist them in integrating mindfulness skills in children's education, helping them to be more resilient, confident, body awareness, and heartfulness.</p>
<p>Through the free online course, Latin American parents and children could learn the basics of mindfulness meditation applied to children, simple yoga exercises for kids, mindful breathing games and short stories about emotions, all of them oriented to make the Home Schooling and the isolation experience of families more bearable and kind.</p>

<h3 align=""center""><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Because the course online will be designed and promoted in Spanish, it could be used also by Spanish-speaking families around the world: not only in Latin America, but also in the U.S and Spain.</p>
<p>This project has been ideated to seed in Latin kids a healthy relationship with their bodies, learn to regulate their emotions and to be resilient. We are thinking of future adulthood.</p>
<p>The course will be also an opportunity for Latin families to cultivate love-based relationships. Societies need to build more compassion-based community ties. We believe in the socialization of emotional intelligence in the long term through the diffusion of mindfulness practices today.</p>

<h3>Come Ride The Waves</h3>
<p>What if there was an easy button to remove stress, tap into your creative genius, and get you to your ultimate state physically, mentally, and emotionally? </p>
<p>I'm Marly Fuller, and 20 years ago I began exploring modalities to remove stress, emotional blocks, and physical ailments so that I could enjoy my own experiences fully. Through trial and error, trainings and journeys around the world, I found the easy buttons and they all have something in common: alpha waves. </p>
<p>Of the five types of brainwaves, neuroscience is proving again and again that alpha waves are the bridge to the subconscious-- a place that contains limitless creativity, imaginative problem solving, and deep relaxation.</p>
<p>During my MBA studies I recognized the value of bringing stress reduction modalities into the workplace. It ignited my curiosity and took me to Rishikesh, India where I was certified as a meditation master, to Eileen McKusick's Biofield tuning training, to getting my Reiki Master's certification, and to exploring the use of sounds, essential oils and breathwork to access the alpha-wave state. </p>
<p>For years I've dreamed of building a retreat center to host multi-day getaways, workshops, and a meditation sanctuary. Enter 2020 and I've been blessed with the opportunity to open a center in Chesterfield, Virginia to provide a physical space for you to come enjoy a variety of these alpha-wave-inducing modalities and workshops. The space will also serve as my hub for providing remote services, offsite workshops at your place of business, and online course creation. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is Alpha Wave Adventures?   </h3>
<p>Alpha Wave Adventures creates immersive and interactive experiences that transport groups and individuals into transcendental realms of relaxation and exploration. <i>Your Journey is the Destination.</i> Explore the depths of your creativity, become crystal clear in your communications, and go beyond the competitive edge.</p>
<p>Accessing these experiences can be off-putting for some people or seem unattainable. In my own experience, meditation is fun and exhilarating. It is not at all what the majority of people believe it to be- especially with the variety of types that I teach. I'm thrilled to offer a location for you to try some of these techniques. </p>
<p>The new space is secured at 9510 Ironbridge Road in Chesterfield Virginia, at the 288 and Ironbridge interchange. I'm raising $3,500 in advance for equipment and to create an environment that is ideal for your maximum experience.     </p>
<p>Here is what your investment in pre-launch services will help with: </p>
<ul>
<li>Meditation room updates (flooring, paint, furniture)= $1,500</li>
<li>Retreat room(s) furnishings (massage table, privacy curtains, comfort elements like blankets, warmers, and eye covers)= $1,000</li>
<li>Business administration start-up costs like client management tools= $500</li>
<li>Branding and Marketing (website, print materials, advertising)= $500 </li>
</ul>
<p>If my goal of $3,500 is not met, I am still planning to open the center to the public by mid-February 2020. Any investment you make during this campaign is redeemable regardless of the goal being met. Thank you for your support! </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>You're Helping to Change the World </h3>
<p>Believe it or not, your small contribution is helping to make the world a more positive place. I have always believed at the root of all problems are stress, anger, and negativity. By opening the center, together we will reduce stress one journeyer at a time. </p>
<p>When we remove stress and tap into those alpha waves, creativity increases dramatically.  Imagine the innovation you and your team will experience when stress is removed from the equation and you float into the place beyond what the mind can think up.  </p>
<p>When I have used these techniques with work teams and individuals, the results have been unreal: </p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals have<ul>
<li>Eliminated body pain, migraines, or emotional triggers to become more conscious leaders</li>
<li>Experienced clarity, peace of mind, a sense of knowing, complete stress reduction, and creative insights for a variety of personal or work related issues  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the workplace:<ul>
<li>Creative problem solving that has led to award winning campaigns</li>
<li>Improved employee engagement and reduced turnover </li>
<li>Unbreakable team bonds and unforgettable experiences </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Are There Any Risks? </h3>
<p>Sure there are. How many yoga shops have you seen pop up and disappear within a matter of months? People are busy and they don't think about taking care of themselves in a way beyond food/water/hygiene.  However, with the proof of neuroscience and the newfound openness to these types of modalities, a center like this begs to manifest. </p>
<p>My plan is to educate potential Alpha Wave Adventurers about the benefits of experiencing these services. I have 20 years of study and multiple certifications, so my content runs deep! Platforms will include social media, free online training, keynote presentations (watch for dates from places like PRSA, SHRM, AMA, and more!)</p>
<p>Is there a risk for your investment? Nope, not one bit! Your perk can be redeemed at any time, regardless of center opening. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help financially at this time, there are other ways you can help! </p>
<p>Are you in the Greater Richmond Area and you know people who will swoon for these services? Please share this campaign, follow Alpha Wave Adventures on Instagram, join the Facebook group, and invite your friends to come along as well. </p>
<p>Interested in bringing some type of meditation into your workplace? Help me connect! Message me through this platform or via alphawaveadventures@gmail.com and let's talk about how we can make that happen. </p>
<p>If you're not in the area, you can still contribute to the campaign and either redeem a service when you're in town or simply give the gift of helping dreams come true.</p>
<p>Thank you for your unwavering support. </p>

If my goal of $3,500 is not met, I am still planning to open the center to the public by mid-February 2020. Any investment you make during this campaign is redeemable regardless of the goal being met. Thank you for your support! 

 
You're Helping to Change the World 
Believe it or not, your small contribution is helping to make the world a more positive place. I have always believed at the root of all problems are stress, anger, and negativity. By opening the center, together we will reduce stress one journeyer at a time. 
When we remove stress and tap into those alpha waves, creativity increases dramatically.  Imagine the innovation you and your team will experience when stress is removed from the equation and you float into the place beyond what the mind can think up.  
When I have used these techniques with work teams and individuals, the results have been unreal: 

Individuals have
Eliminated body pain, migraines, or emotional triggers to become more conscious leaders
Experienced clarity, peace of mind, a sense of knowing, complete stress reduction, and creative insights for a variety of personal or work related issues  


For the workplace:
Creative problem solving that has led to award winning campaigns
Improved employee engagement and reduced turnover 
Unbreakable team bonds and unforgettable experiences 




 
Are There Any Risks? 
Sure there are. How many yoga shops have you seen pop up and disappear within a matter of months? People are busy and they don't think about taking care of themselves in a way beyond food/water/hygiene.  However, with the proof of neuroscience and the newfound openness to these types of modalities, a center like this begs to manifest. 
My plan is to educate potential Alpha Wave Adventurers about the benefits of experiencing these services. I have 20 years of study and multiple certifications, so my content runs deep! Platforms will include social media, free online training, keynote presentations (watch for dates from places like PRSA, SHRM, AMA, and more!)
Is there a risk for your investment? Nope, not one bit! Your perk can be redeemed at any time, regardless of center opening. 
 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't help financially at this time, there are other ways you can help! 
Are you in the Greater Richmond Area and you know people who will swoon for these services? Please share this campaign, follow Alpha Wave Adventures on Instagram, join the Facebook group, and invite your friends to come along as well. 
Interested in bringing some type of meditation into your workplace? Help me connect! Message me through this platform or via alphawaveadventures@gmail.com and let's talk about how we can make that happen. 
If you're not in the area, you can still contribute to the campaign and either redeem a service when you're in town or simply give the gift of helping dreams come true.
Thank you for your unwavering support.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Boosting your immune system to kill cancer cells is very important to heal. Or you may have an Autoimmune Disorder (your immune system firing against something it can't kill, typically a Toxin like heavy metals, and destroys self-tissue). Evidence suggests that Microbes (Microbiome) play a significant role in specific cancers and increases inflammation.  80% of the Immune System is located within the Digestive Tract. <u>Your GUT is the command center for your immune system</u>.     </p><p>Yet, traditional medical treatments can often destroy the immune system.  That doesn’t make sense.  There are high death rates within 5 and 10 years for the most common cancers.  Don’t be a statistic: ""there is a 34% death rate for common cancers in 5 years on average per the NCI.""  And 50% in 10 years in the U.K.  Complicated cancers have much higher death rates at 80% +.</p><p>The majority of the patients making up these statistics we understand were treated using standard medical treatments. What are your odds of survival? Probably very good immediately following treatments .... but what about after 3 to 5 years or 10 years? Lets all try and help improve upon those figures together.</p><p><strong>CURE:  We all have cancer - its natural.</strong> Our immune systems are designed to kill cancer cells. That's why fundamentally there is no such thing as a cure for cancer in our view - the solution is already available to us all. Unfortunately it is only the extreme cases of excessive cancer cell growth, not destroyed by the immune system, that affects certain individuals who then become so-called cancer victims.     </p><p><strong>STEM CELL: </strong>The actual stem cell<strong> </strong>of a cancer cell must either be destroyed or the cell healed fully to be successful - else you are just prolonging the ultimate outcome of cancer returning again or spreading (which it will). Current treatments often do not actually kill the stem cells (and certainly don't heal the actual cancer cells). Thus you are just treating cancer - not healing.  Draw your own conclusions please respecting current treatment options.</p><p><strong>SHRINK TUMORS: 3 Approved Non-Invasive Strategies - </strong>one may stop cancer from spreading: </p><p>Cancer is simply a disease. It will spread or metastasize - which is typically the cause of death not the actual tumor itself.  You can't just focus on the tumor, if any.  Circulating Tumor Cells must be controlled.</p><p><strong>Common Sense:</strong>  Understand that medical professionals have proven that <strong>a cancer cell can be fully killed by either 1) Heating it up above 105.5 degrees; 2) by Freezing the cell; or 3) by providing intense Oxygen to the blood / cell </strong>(combined with the correct diet which starves the growth of the cells).  Tumors could shrink accordingly. There are approved medical devices at recognized clinics that can perform these strategies.  These procedures have been functioning in Europe previously and are now recognized by the FDA and Health Canada.</p><p>All three of these non-invasive strategies are available and can be performed at certain locally approved clinics. But very few medical professionals are even aware of these new strategies or can not use them due to governance issues. They are very reasonably priced.

Whatever your reason we can assist. KEY APPROACH: Together we adapt the OCC #1 Strategy Approach to potentially manage or prevent cancer with you.  Its designed for the common cancers then adapted for the more complicated cancers like Brain Cancer. To Keep It Simple: The Approach combines 6 key non-invasive strategies that are specific to your type of cancer as recommended by certain leading medical professionals. No one strategy should be used to obtained results - it's a combination of excellent stand-alone strategies that do it.  But ultimately you decide to include a strategy  or to replace it for another one with the information made available.  Together during our guidance and coaching sessions we will guide you to find the right BALANCE for you. IN BRIEF We find a Balance for YouAnd of course, let's try to limit your STRESS and get control of your life back.The OCC Strategic STEPS(TM) to Manage or Prevent Cancer:Include the complete OCC Strategic VIII STEPS  to optimize results or keep it simple and just consider The OCC #1 Strategy Approach(TM) if you have one of the most common cancers or it is adapted for more difficult cancers.   UNDERSTANDING CANCER & OUR PROCESS Incorporated into The OCC #1 Strategy Approach""Understand that you need to HEAL ,,, not just to be Treated.  Else you are just prolonging the time before your cancer returns""DNA: Cells become cancerous because of damage to their DNA and mutate.  The cells grow out of control and can spread into tissue.  Isolate what caused the DNA damage.FUNDAMENTAL:  According to medical professionals, in order for cancer cells to survive they basically require these conditions: Availability of Glucose; Anaerobic surroundings – Less Oxygen; and the Availability of Glutamine + Methionine.Leading doctors and prominent Ph.D.'s newly recommend: “One avenue to reduce the growth of cancer cells is simply to starve their food sources such as glucose and glutamine-rich foods, then increase the amount of oxygen in the blood.”  Ozone kills pathogens on contact and heals at a cellular level.  We incorporate this critical strategy into the OCC #1 Strategy Approach which is fundamental to our Process.IMMUNE SYSTEM:  Cancer is a disease that your immune system is not fighting properly. Boosting your immune system to kill cancer cells is very important to heal. Or you may have an Autoimmune Disorder (your immune system firing against something it can't kill, typically a Toxin like heavy metals, and destroys self-tissue). Evidence suggests that Microbes (Microbiome) play a significant role in specific cancers and increases inflammation.  80% of the Immune System is located within the Digestive Tract. Your GUT is the command center for your immune system.     Yet, traditional medical treatments can often destroy the immune system.  That doesn’t make sense.  There are high death rates within 5 and 10 years for the most common cancers.  Don’t be a statistic: ""there is a 34% death rate for common cancers in 5 years on average per the NCI.""  And 50% in 10 years in the U.K.  Complicated cancers have much higher death rates at 80% +.The majority of the patients making up these statistics we understand were treated using standard medical treatments. What are your odds of survival? Probably very good immediately following treatments .... but what about after 3 to 5 years or 10 years? Lets all try and help improve upon those figures together.CURE:  We all have cancer - its natural. Our immune systems are designed to kill cancer cells. That's why fundamentally there is no such thing as a cure for cancer in our view - the solution is already available to us all. Unfortunately it is only the extreme cases of excessive cancer cell growth, not destroyed by the immune system, that affects certain individuals who then become so-called cancer victims.     STEM CELL: The actual stem cell of a cancer cell must either be destroyed or the cell healed fully to be successful - else you are just prolonging the ultimate outcome of cancer returning again or spreading (which it will). Current treatments often do not actually kill the stem cells (and certainly don't heal the actual cancer cells). Thus you are just treating cancer - not healing.  Draw your own conclusions please respecting current treatment options.SHRINK TUMORS: 3 Approved Non-Invasive Strategies - one may stop cancer from spreading: Cancer is simply a disease. It will spread or metastasize - which is typically the cause of death not the actual tumor itself.  You can't just focus on the tumor, if any.  Circulating Tumor Cells must be controlled.Common Sense:  Understand that medical professionals have proven that a cancer cell can be fully killed by either 1) Heating it up above 105.5 degrees; 2) by Freezing the cell; or 3) by providing intense Oxygen to the blood / cell (combined with the correct diet which starves the growth of the cells).  Tumors could shrink accordingly. There are approved medical devices at recognized clinics that can perform these strategies.  These procedures have been functioning in Europe previously and are now recognized by the FDA and Health Canada.All three of these non-invasive strategies are available and can be performed at certain locally approved clinics. But very few medical professionals are even aware of these new strategies or can not use them due to governance issues. They are very reasonably priced. They are recently recognized by the FDA and Health Canada. These three strategies can potentially avoid surgery, radiation or chemotherapy (or enhance their outcomes) per such experts recommending the strategies.One such strategy is also an excellent prevention strategy for cancer and other disease that should be considered for all prevention purposes in our view.In addition, one must work on preventing cancer from spreading once any tumor is dealt with.KILL CANCER CELLS:    Stand Alone Products & the #1 Product used in Asia (Without Devastating Side-Effects):There are 7 specific Integrative Products that can kill cancer cells recommended by Doctors and most are backed by case studiesIncluding one Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) recommended by experts which has been used for centuries in China and Asia as the number one cancer fighting product.  It’s now acknowledged by doctors and scientists in North America.  Why not test it … it won’t hurt you and it's good enough for use within Japan’s hospitals.  It's been called, ""Magical.""PLUS, If you believe in or understand quantum physics - for your consideration there are Frequency Devices used in Europe since the 1930's known to kill cancer cells. But are without case studies.CANCER as a METABOLIC DISEASE:    Per two Ph.D.’s with related case studies, only 5% of cancer cases are hereditary in nature. They conclude, 5% of cancer cases are hereditary, 30% of cases are caused by Diet / Obesity, 30% by Smoking, 5% Sedentary Lifestyle and the other causes will be provided to you.Now leading M.D.'s and Ph.D.'s conclude that Cancer is predominantly a metabolic disease that can be caused by environmental / lifestyle / diet issues.  This is crucial to understand and changes the way to approach cancer. IMPORTANT:  Reduce INFLAMMATION and DETOXIFY your body and Liver.  Plus manage your Pancreas.  A PH Level of 7+ can be key to heal.INFLAMMATION: The chronic inflammation of a TH2 immune response suppresses the needed TH1 immune response which is largely responsible to control cancer cell growth. STRESS a common factor that needs to be managed as it can shut down your Immune System.  We offer Stress ManagementSTRESS and Mind Traumas  It is important to recognize that many cancer victims require both physical and mental assistance.  We can refer you to an independent professional who can treat you Online via Skype.  They can relieve most stress related issues within 3 or 4 one hour visits.TWO COMMON ITEMS IN MOST CANCER VICTIMS:  1) Poor GUT Health leading to Leaky Gut Syndrome (toxins leak from the small intestine into the body and organs); and 2) Thyroid issues - thyroid care is important yet so simple to deal with - however it is virtually ignored in current treatment protocols.ENDOCRINE DISORDERS: Cancer can be associated with Endocrine Disorders (Glands/Hormones).  Poor Gut Health and Leaky Gut Syndrome can lead to poor liver functioning and endocrine disorders (your glands not functioning properly such as your thyroid or pancreas).  This can greatly effect your Immune System (or autoimmune disorders) - which can lead to Cancer.PARABENS or preservatives are listed as Priority 1 Substances in Europe that Disrupt the Endocrine System ( Found in: Pharmaceuticals, Deodorants, Cosmetics, Perfumes, Shampoo, Toothpaste, etc.)ARE YOU DRESSED TO KILL?  Is your Clothing, Bras, Deodorants, Cosmetics, Perfumes / Fragrances, Soaps Killing You?  Discuss with us.PATHOGENS & TOXINS (ANTIGENS) Cause Disease: Cancer is also influenced or thought to be caused by Pathogens, Toxins and Radiation & Electromagnetic Fields (either exposure or consumption generally) per many medical professionals. Toxins and Bacteria are factors. Dental Toxins can also be a factor.Pathogens are living microorganisms (like a virus, bacteria, fungus, parasite) while Toxins are non-living (like chemicals, heavy metals). WHO lists many Carcinogens which we can provide.   AVOID these potential factors and Eliminate Them as they disrupt the DNA of cells.ANIMAL PROTEINS & DAIRY Contain ANTIGENS:  Per UCLA,  ""Eating a diet rich in animal proteins during middle age makes you 4 Times More Likely To Die From Cancer - a mortality risk factor comparable to Smoking Cigarettes.""   Give Your Child a Cigarette or a Chicken Wing?There is Irrefutable Evidence that links Animal Proteins & Dairy to Chronic Inflammation, Cancer & Disease.  Per WHO: Red Meat is a probable Carcinogen & Processed Meats are Carcinogenic (the same rating as Asbestos).  Want a side of Asbestos with your Hot Dog?   REQUEST OUR RESEARCH ON THIS TOPIC. We must find a Balance that is right for you - either a plant based diet if chronically ill or moderate animal proteins depending on your Circumstance. SUPPRESS Ras/Raf Oncogene Expression found in 40% of all cancer casesNUTRITION: Is critical to HEAL & Prevent Disease.  The OCC Nutritional Solution Strategy(TM)ELIMINATE CAUSES: Determine what’s caused your cancer and then eliminate those causes so cancer does not return - else it eventually will.  Use THE OCC INTAKE FORM & Your CANCER CAUSE(TM)AT THE HEART OF CANCER:  ANTIGENS (non-living Toxins or Pathogens - hard to kill living virus, mold, candida, etc) and/or secondarily Radiation / EMF's.  Antigens and/or Radiation when combined with (or Cause) Immune System Disorders can be at the Heart of Cancer. DISCOVER & ELIMINATE ANTIGENS and secondarily Radiation /EMF's TO HEAL. OUR KEY APPROACH INCLUDES :    Re-Engineer & Boost Your Immune System to heal and kill cancer cells:   First, Detox the body and the Liver.

He was to be a professional football player before a serious accident changed his path.  He has a young son he needs to live for. He has been treated multiple times without success and such hospitals have placed garnishees on his wages. Yet his positive attitude is remarkable. We know how to reverse his skin cancer within 30 days and shrink his multiple lung tumors within 60 days. May  is a single 64 year old grandmother who recently underwent a double mastectomy - she is exhausted by the treatments both mentally and physically. Her immune system is devastated. She lives in constant fear that she will die from this cancer disease - just like her mother who passed when May was only 8 years old.  May is on a fixed income and simply can't afford help.  She truly needs an extensive non-invasive strategy soon.  She was involved over her life helping thousands of children and has given back to so many over her life. So as the Nike ad says,  let's Just Do It.  In this case - Together.  PLANS to CONSIDEREmail and DISCUSS Your Options1) OCC Manage Cancer Plans(TM)  WHAT IS YOUR LIFE WORTH?   The Complete Process, Strategic Plans and Guidance & Coaching Program to potentially manage your cancer within 4 months.    Minimums for those less fortunate or pay what your inner self tells you to do above this amount please.  If financially secure please contribute handsomely so we can assist you fully and help others.

We would return your amount, if any. Contact US: OnlineCancerClinic@gmail.com  THE OCC STEPS TO MANAGE CANCERKeep It Simple:  Use The OCC #1 Strategy Approach for common cancers and focus there on the 6 key strategies.  The Approach can adapt to your cancer and circumstance. OR complete all the VIII Strategic Steps below to optimize results.  Everyone is unique and this can be customized in order to find your  BALANCE. Step I: Determine The Cause of cancer always and Eliminate that cause(s). Only 5% of cases are hereditary. We provide that guide to determine your cause then suggest how to eliminate. Step II and III: Detox & Inflammation Strategies; and Boost Your Immune SystemImportant to assist in this entire process else cancer will return.  Cancer can be about inflammation. The immune system fights cancer cells - so boost it to heal.  See Our Approach above to understand this better. Step IV: OCC Nutrition Strategies(TM) to stop feeding cancer cells and to potentially starve them per leading Ph.D.’s and M.D.'s.  We inform you what foods to AVOID that cancer cells feed-on (to grow). Plus Use cancer fighting foods daily as recommended by two leading Ph.D.’s.  And use the right food choices to manage or prevent cancer potentially.Either get foods delivered or use our meal plans. Step V: A Standard Process to include is :  Manage Leaky Gut Syndrome. A basic liver and body detox strategy, specific enzymes recommended by leading M.D.’s which could be considered stand-alone items; and specialized Probiotics plus quality Omega 3 for consideration for metabolic health.  But they must be the correct quality products else it's a waste of time and money. Regular SUNSHINE for vitamin D as described in our plans to be used properly. Many experts state this is crucial to cancer care. Ever notice that folks living in southern climates are generally HAPPY and HEALTHY?Endocrine Disorders are recognized and managed.  Thyroid care is important to most cancer victims or to help prevent cancer - but is somehow overlooked today - it can be critical yet easily managed. Thyroid & Pancreas strategies are provided.And ALWAYS consider the #1 TCM product(s) used to prevent or manage cancer in Asia at hospitals and now supported by certain North American M.D.'s and Ph.D.'s.  Step VI: Create Oxygen Rich and Non-Toxic Environments at home or work. Treat cancer at the cellular level - your cells love oxygen (cancer and disease thrives in low oxygen environments internally).  Radiation and chemicals (Toxins) either via exposure or consumption are thought to cause cancer or certainly do influence cancer cells - especially if you have a specific genetic defect that is susceptible to certain disease like cancer.  If radiation is a potential cause or influences cancer cells - what conclusions should you draw from that? What treatments are currently used that include radiation or chemicals?Oxygen strategies are very important to potentially reverse or prevent cancer (and many other disease) at the cellular level. Improve what's called the Mitochondria - the energy source of your cells. Step VII: Activity & Lifestyle Plans.  Many techniques to consider especially to avoid the causes of cancer.  They can be customized to your circumstance.Included are: Walk 20 minutes and preferably 40 minutes daily (as a minimum) to burn calories and assist your body on so many levels - mentally and physically.  You need to be active (you don't need to attend boot camp) to assist with your health. Exercise produces ketones which is what experts want in this instance. We provide several activity plans to consider that can be customized for you. But the more you exercise - the better potentially for your prevention or reversal outcomes.Suggested Net Calorie ranges for cancer prevention or management are also provided. Many other items are included. 
Step VIII: STRATEGIES to KILL CANCER CELLS ""WITHOUT DEVASTATING SIDE-EFFECTS""Combine these strategies with current medical treatments to declare war on cancer or test them independently if your doctor feels you can defer any radical medical treatments for an additional 3 months.  Or if you have recently been treated for cancer and don't want cancer to return - then prevention strategies definitely should be considered.  The Strategies will include among others, these items below which can be adapted to meet your Budget, Lifestyle, Region and Unique Circumstance. Keep it simple and use the OCC #1 Strategy Approach or get very detailed depending on your Balance: A) START WITH THE OCC #1 STRATEGY APPROACH(TM)                          B) ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES:i) The OCC Nutritional Strategy Solution(TM) to potentially starve and heal cancer cells. ii) Products suggested by medical professionals for your consideration that could be considered as stand-alone solutions.  Ones that either potentially kill cancer cells or heal them.  They have solid track records per experts or case studies.There are several very compelling items to kill caner cells - and ones that are specific to certain cancers.  There are 7 very important items to consider as stand-alone products - pick two that will be identified as specific to your cancer or for prevention purposes.  One supplement or the actual related food source is a must to be considered.  In particular, one product is highlighted that is an absolute stand-alone product used to potentially kill cancer cells.iii) 3 Non-Invasive Therapies (meaning no surgery required) to shrink tumors that could be considered without performing surgery, radiation or chemotherapy (or can be used to enhance those outcomes greatly) per experts.  One therapy can also be used for prevention purposes and is remarkable for its health benefits at a cellular level.  It's principles date back to a Nobel Prize winning theory that is now put into logical practice.iv) Plus the #1 Traditional Chinese Medicine product(s) used in Asian hospitals to reverse or prevent cancer and used by Asian physicians.  It is a must to consider in our view for healing in combination with other strategies.v) Oxygen Therapies and new oxygen techniques are very important to manage or prevent cancer per leading experts at the cellular level.vi) Lifestyle Plans and other strategies and techniques to greatly assist.  Sunshine techniques for vitamin D are important.  As is Thyroid care.  Vitamin C and B strategies are suggested.vii) Enzyme Strategies per leading M.D.'s. must be considered.NOTE: No one item should be used alone. It’s always a combination of strategies and techniques that work – while not over-taxing the liver or becoming over-toxic.  Typically just 2 strategies at a time should be considered to ensure toxic levels within your body are appropriate other than the 3 Non-Invasive Therapies suggested above.vii) The Top Two Strategies for your specific cancer are provided.viii) The Number One Strategy to reverse or prevent cancer as recommended by, and which has received tremendous results within, a leading Integrative Cancer Therapist's clinic (a Board Certified Doctor). It is also recognized by many other alternative practitioners - yet disenfranchised by the medical community understandably.  This strategy only has positive clinical results - not evidence based case studies.  Done in conjunction with other strategies it could be considered and certainly won't harm you.ix) The Top 4 Strategies from an Integrative Cancer Therapy & Doctor ( plus ones that are specific to your cancer).x) SKIN CANCER - The shockingly easiest strategy on the planet that could help you within 6 weeks or less without surgery, radiation or chemotherapy or used in conjunction with them.xi) Hail-Mary Strategy: for when your doctors have given up on further treatment options. Brain cancer as an example or Stage 4 situations perhaps.xii) In addition, We provide certain strategies that are supplement, herb, oil or product related strategies from Doctors that are Board Certified in Integrative Cancer Therapy. These are all potentially stand-alone products to manage or prevent specific cancers.  Many have been used historically as alternative strategies.xiii) Frequency Related Therapies to kill cancer cells and improve your health.  IF you believe in quantum physics and feel that cells are simply energy - then disrupt the frequency of cancer cells to heal.  You decide on the merits.  Certain cancer specialists refuse to treat their patients without including these techniques - they are common in Europe.PLUS, Other techniques and strategies are provided for your information.  REFERRAL TO SPECIALISTS:If required, once a client, we can attempt to refer you to clinics who recognize these strategies (there are not many) – they are all M.D.’s.  But they can be very expensive ranging from $20,000 for initial periods to $40,000 to $175,000+.  Travel will be required to Europe or elsewhere. TESTIMONIALS, Our GROWTH & TIMING to DELIVERY""We Are Ready To Start Now""  We have tested our processes with very good receptiveness at this stage of our development.  However, we will not ever use our valued clients as marketing tools - just as you would not appreciate us sharing your confidential information or having it released.Our fee guarantee process is meant to take care of any credibility concerns versus using our clients as marketing tools at this time. Hopefully that speaks to the confidence we have in our process. The Strategies we provide are from medical professionals who have perhaps 100's of combined years in practice, research and wisdom.  Some strategies date back 100's of years - other are new and revolutionary but the medical professionals relied upon are leaders in their specialty field with years of experience and track records.  You benefit accordingly.Contact Us:  OnlineCancerClinic@gmail.com ABOUT USOUR MANAGING DIRECTOR & FOUNDERMr. Mason has previously controlled and operated 25 Medical Clinics with a small team that had over 70 M.D.'s plus over 75 support staff on payroll. Certain clinics also offered pharmacy, laboratory, imagining, dental, physio, psychiatry, and other services in addition to family medicine and walk-in care.  He has been involved with projects including cardiovascular monitoring over the internet, PRP / Stem Cells, and Electronic Medical Records.  Also controlled previously with a small team 100 Optical Stores with Optical Lab.  He has previously been an Author, Broadcaster and Public Speaker.He understands the medical business, how it functions and how the new delivery model to help others truly needs to be online - to save the health care system extensive costs and to be practical in today's evolving world. Plus after working with doctors for over the past 30 years knows the importance of only using medical professionals to provide and prove any strategies before providing the same for information purposes.He is approaching the age of 60 and has the experience, drive and ability to lead the Online Cancer Clinics onto greatness.  He is not a doctor rather an experienced businessman. He has great vision and compassion for others and knows how to treat all team members with respect and to give them the confidence so they can personally excel.  And truly wants to help others.  Previously he has been involved with extensive real estate development projects - if you can build buildings you can get thru many business issues at all levels.A Personal Note from Our Founder:""I lost both parents to cancer and vowed to do something about it!  Especially motivated by my loving mother  -  if only I knew then what I know now - I could have greatly helped her. I have spent the past 8 years on this journey to be here now in a position to help others.If you are like me, cancer has affected our family greatly!  My cousins have suffered. We have lost wonderful aunts and uncles to cancer - all of which could have been prevented in our view.  Plus friends or acquaintances over the years have suffered (perhaps needlessly).Initially we started out to create an online medical clinic to help others - only to realize that doctors can not generally provide their services outside of their jurisdiction of governance or not even online in most jurisdictions.  However, we know that the future of health care must be delivered online.Accordingly, we have developed our delivery model, systems and processes - they really are unique and will help change the world. So when challenged with not being able to have doctors directly on staff - we turned to perhaps something better.  We decided to draw upon world leading medical professionals and authorities to help others - and not to be restricted to just any one physician. We have spent the majority of our time not on marketing; rather on development and research (as one can only imagine how consuming that must be).  So when we say we can potentially save you years of research to understand how to deal with cancer - we mean it.I was perhaps one of the several pioneers in developing walk-in medical clinics many years ago.  Today walk-in medical clinics are very common.  We anticipate that our style of online clinics will also become common within 15 to 20 years.  For now we are unique - but our strategies are based upon the years of experience and studies of certain medical professionals.We truly are here to help and will do our best by you.  I wish you well on your health journey and really hope that we can assist you or your loved ones. Our Vision is to revolutionize how we ALL manage or prevent disease and to enhance LONGEVITY.""    In our case, it will be, ""One Client at a Time."" TEAM and TEAM MEMBERS TO DEVELOPManaging Director                      Senior CoachesAssociate Coaches                      Medical AdvisersNatural Health Advisers             Research AssociatesCommunications Director         Operations DirectorOperations Staff                            Marketing & Client Support  CONTACT US:   OnlineCancerClinic@gmail.com OUR PROCESS:    We encourage you to continue with your medical treatments and doctor's advice.  These strategies and information are designed to work with your medical treatments for better outcomes.

<p>I'm Clare Jackson, I live in Northern England with my partner and 2 young children. My story began in 1997, I had a very stressful job working with abused children, I was looking for a way to de-stress and began having regular massages and meditating. This was where my interests began in Holistic health as it enabled me to work under extreme pressure.</p>
<p>In 2013 I retrained as a Holistic Massage Therapist and set up my own business called Connective Healing. I offer various therapies such Swedish massage, Deep tissue massage, Indian head massage, Warm Bamboo massage, Reiki and regularly hold a Group Guided Meditation session. Have a look at my website <a href=""http://www.connectivehealing.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.connectivehealing.co.uk</a></p>
<p>I noticed through my work that people had recurrent problems from Painful or irregular menstrual cycle, Fertility challenges, PMS, Pelvic congestion,Tilted or prolapsed uterus, Frequent urination, Headaches/dizziness with periods, Constipation or digestive complaints, Ovarian cysts or fibroids.</p>
<p>It was very soon that I too would experience similar problems as I found out that had an ovarian cyst from which I then entered into Premature Menopause. It was devastating at the time and threw my whole identity up into crisis.</p>
<p> So this is where my interest in the Arvigo Techniques of Maya Abdominal Therapy® started. They have their roots in Central America and are the collective wisdom of traditional healers and Dr. Rosita Arvigo, this work combines ancient healing with modern anatomical understanding.</p>
<p>I attended a workshop hosted by Steph Magenta in Manchester, it was run by Hilary Lewin called Mining for Diamonds, with reference to the Menopause. It was a life changing moment for me and felt like the wheels were now in motion for me to follow this path. Hilary trained directly with Dr Rosita Arvigo and was instrumental in bringing this work to Europe and facilitated the first training outside the USA. </p>
<p>The <tt>Arvigo®</tt> techniques were developed by Dr. Rosita Arvigo, DN. based on her apprenticeship with the Maya healer Don Elijio Panti and her own education, training, and research as a Naprapathic Physician. Rosita's lifework, <tt>THE ARVIGO TECHNIQUES OF MAYA ABDOMINAL THERAPY</tt>®, help to restore the body to its natural balance by correcting the position of organs that have shifted and restrict the flow of blood, lymph, nerve and chi energy. Today the <tt>Arvigo®</tt> techniques are employed by <tt>Arvigo</tt>® Practitioners across the globe bringing the benefits of natural healing to their clients.</p>
<p>Dr. Arvigo learned these techniques from her mentor, Don Elijio Panti, the great Maya Shaman of Belize, Central America with whom she apprenticed for ten years. Don Elijio believed that a woman's center is her uterus. ""If a woman's uterus is out of balance, so is she,"" he would say. Midwives and healers of Central America agree that most female troubles are caused by the wandering womb. Don Elijio passed away in 1996 at the age of 103. Rosita also studied with Hortence Robinson, a traditional midwife and herbalist of Belize who began delivering babies when she was only 13.</p>
<p>The Arvigo Techniques of Maya Abdominal Therapy® address position and health of the pelvic and abdominal organs. The work is best known for the correction of the prolapsed, fallen, or tilted uterus and for the prevention and treatment of benign prostate enlargement in men, and for relief of many common digestive disorders.<br/><br/>I completed my Arvigo® Therapy Self-Care Workshop with Arvigo teacher Amanda Porter and the sheer amount of knowledge and experience that was exchanged furthered my interest still. I knew then I needed to complete the Practitioner's training and be able to offer this therapy at Connective Healing to my clients. </p>
<p>Through contributing towards my training costs, you will enable me to offer this therapy to clients old and new. Here are the benefits of The Arvigo Techniques of Maya Abdominal Therapy®:</p>
<p>By repositioning the uterus back into place, homeostasis, or the natural balance of the body, is restored in the pelvic area and the surrounding organs. Toxins are flushed and nutrients that help to tone tissue and balance hormones are restored to normal order. This is essential for healthy pregnancy, labor, and delivery.</p>
<p>Old adhesions from invasive treatments to the pelvic and abdominal area, including fibroid tumors, endometriosis, and cesarean delivery are diminished when addressed by uterine massage. In addition, digestion, urinary and bladder problems can be helped.</p>
<p>For men by ensuring a full blood supply to the prostate, the abdominal massage helps to prevent swelling and inflammation. Men report that they can feel a distinct difference in blood flow after a treatment. Not only does the massage relieve prostate swelling, but it helps alleviate varicose veins, premature ejaculation, some impotency problems and the need to urinate frequently.</p>
<p>Individuals with digestive disorders benefit greatly from the techniques. Many of our common disorders such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome, indigestion, constipation, and heartburn are treated with antacids, muscle relaxants, and a variety of other medications. These treatments address symptoms, not the causes. By using The Arvigo Techniques of Maya Abdominal Therapy®, the upper abdomen is also given a deep, thorough massage to loosen the tight muscles around the stomach and the arteries that feed the digestive and eliminative organs with their vital blood supply. The diaphragm is gently massaged allowing relaxation of tight musculature.</p>
<p>I have plans for the future to use my experience of working with young people and to set up a Mother's and Daughter's group around Menstruation and care of the pelvis. </p>
<p>In terms of funding, the overall costs amount to</p>
<ul>
<li>$300 registration fee,</li>
<li>$1750 for training, </li>
<li>£750 accommodation costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would really love to be able to raise half of the overall costs. </p>
</div><div>
<p>In relation to contribution I can offer a variety of things to thank you for your contribution.</p>
<p>For a contribution of £20-£29-99 you will receive a selection of gorgeous Neal's Yard samples.</p>
<p>For contributions of £30-00 to £49-99 you will receive a free Guided meditation download written by me.</p>
<p>For contributions over £50-00 you will a receive the invitation to a free Group Guided Meditation session to be held at a location and date in my hometown in Northern England.</p>
</div><div>
<p>The impact of The Arvigo Techniques of Maya Abdominal Therapy® is phenomenal to individuals and helps them to take a Holistic approach to their health and involve them in that process. I feel it empowers individuals to bring about tangible health benefits through their own participation.</p>
<p>I worked for 20 years with Children in my past job and always applied myself 100% to my work, I helped develop Lancashire Children's Rights Mentoring and Advocacy scheme now known as The Children's Society in Lancashire.</p>
<p>When I set up Connective Healing  I researched it thoroughly, took business advice, joined a Business Mentoring scheme and applied complete professionalism to my work. This isn't me playing at something I enjoy, it's me offering my skills to people to make lifestyle choices about their health.</p>
<p>I work hard and treat all of my clients individually. I would love to be able to offer the Arvigo Techniques of Maya Abdominal Therapy® as a new therapy at Connective Healing and further an integrated, Connective approach to health.</p>
</div><div><p>I understand that not all people will be able to make a financial contribution however you can still help, all I ask is that folks get the word out and make some noise about my campaign.</p></div><div><ul><li>Just please use the Indiegogo share tools!</li></ul></div><p>And that's all there is to it, thank you so much for taking the time to listen and help.</p><p>Love and best wishes</p><p>Clare x</p></div>","I'm Clare Jackson, I live in Northern England with my partner and 2 young children.

The work is best known for the correction of the prolapsed, fallen, or tilted uterus and for the prevention and treatment of benign prostate enlargement in men, and for relief of many common digestive disorders.I completed my Arvigo® Therapy Self-Care Workshop with Arvigo teacher Amanda Porter and the sheer amount of knowledge and experience that was exchanged furthered my interest still. I knew then I needed to complete the Practitioner's training and be able to offer this therapy at Connective Healing to my clients. 
Through contributing towards my training costs, you will enable me to offer this therapy to clients old and new. Here are the benefits of The Arvigo Techniques of Maya Abdominal Therapy®:
By repositioning the uterus back into place, homeostasis, or the natural balance of the body, is restored in the pelvic area and the surrounding organs. Toxins are flushed and nutrients that help to tone tissue and balance hormones are restored to normal order. This is essential for healthy pregnancy, labor, and delivery.
Old adhesions from invasive treatments to the pelvic and abdominal area, including fibroid tumors, endometriosis, and cesarean delivery are diminished when addressed by uterine massage. In addition, digestion, urinary and bladder problems can be helped.
For men by ensuring a full blood supply to the prostate, the abdominal massage helps to prevent swelling and inflammation. Men report that they can feel a distinct difference in blood flow after a treatment. Not only does the massage relieve prostate swelling, but it helps alleviate varicose veins, premature ejaculation, some impotency problems and the need to urinate frequently.
Individuals with digestive disorders benefit greatly from the techniques. Many of our common disorders such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome, indigestion, constipation, and heartburn are treated with antacids, muscle relaxants, and a variety of other medications. These treatments address symptoms, not the causes. By using The Arvigo Techniques of Maya Abdominal Therapy®, the upper abdomen is also given a deep, thorough massage to loosen the tight muscles around the stomach and the arteries that feed the digestive and eliminative organs with their vital blood supply. The diaphragm is gently massaged allowing relaxation of tight musculature.
I have plans for the future to use my experience of working with young people and to set up a Mother's and Daughter's group around Menstruation and care of the pelvis. 
In terms of funding, the overall costs amount to

$300 registration fee,
$1750 for training, 
£750 accommodation costs.

I would really love to be able to raise half of the overall costs. 

In relation to contribution I can offer a variety of things to thank you for your contribution.
For a contribution of £20-£29-99 you will receive a selection of gorgeous Neal's Yard samples.
For contributions of £30-00 to £49-99 you will receive a free Guided meditation download written by me.
For contributions over £50-00 you will a receive the invitation to a free Group Guided Meditation session to be held at a location and date in my hometown in Northern England.

The impact of The Arvigo Techniques of Maya Abdominal Therapy® is phenomenal to individuals and helps them to take a Holistic approach to their health and involve them in that process. I feel it empowers individuals to bring about tangible health benefits through their own participation.
I worked for 20 years with Children in my past job and always applied myself 100% to my work, I helped develop Lancashire Children's Rights Mentoring and Advocacy scheme now known as The Children's Society in Lancashire.
When I set up Connective Healing  I researched it thoroughly, took business advice, joined a Business Mentoring scheme and applied complete professionalism to my work. This isn't me playing at something I enjoy, it's me offering my skills to people to make lifestyle choices about their health.
I work hard and treat all of my clients individually. I would love to be able to offer the Arvigo Techniques of Maya Abdominal Therapy® as a new therapy at Connective Healing and further an integrated, Connective approach to health.
I understand that not all people will be able to make a financial contribution however you can still help, all I ask is that folks get the word out and make some noise about my campaign.Just please use the Indiegogo share tools!And that's all there is to it, thank you so much for taking the time to listen and help.Love and best wishesClare x",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> </p>
<p>After what seemed like a lifetime of carrying feelings of fear of being judged, shame and rage, I finally realised through my own healing journey, that there is nothing more liberating and rewarding than breaking the silence. On the 23rd September 1998, my husband and I were hijacked and I was raped. This entire experience had changed my life completely and as I reflect on it now it changed it in the most positive ways. My story which I share with you will walk you through the experience that night and the healing I knew I had to do to move from feelings of despair, darkness, and hopelessness to forgiveness, self-love and hope. This journey has made me realise that there are so many other women who are grappling with similar challenges and that it is important for me to share the tools and processes that I used. I have therefore, developed a workbook which is the beginning of a series of workbooks that I will be working on. We launched the women’s program (The Power of Self Love) in December 2018, over 3 days. The ladies were taken through a workshop based on the workbook and it was decided that we needed to share this wisdom and healing with younger women. Based on this decision we have organised the workshop for 20 young ladies which we require funding for.</p>

</div></div>","After what seemed like a lifetime of carrying feelings of fear of being judged, shame and rage, I finally realised through my own healing journey, that there is nothing more liberating and rewarding than breaking the silence. On the 23rd September 1998, my husband and I were hijacked and I was raped. This entire experience had changed my life completely and as I reflect on it now it changed it in the most positive ways. My story which I share with you will walk you through the experience that night and the healing I knew I had to do to move from feelings of despair, darkness, and hopelessness to forgiveness, self-love and hope. This journey has made me realise that there are so many other women who are grappling with similar challenges and that it is important for me to share the tools and processes that I used. I have therefore, developed a workbook which is the beginning of a series of workbooks that I will be working on. We launched the women’s program (The Power of Self Love) in December 2018, over 3 days. The ladies were taken through a workshop based on the workbook and it was decided that we needed to share this wisdom and healing with younger women.

<p>I have designed a wellness transformation program to help people who struggle with weight, stress and self-confidence. This is not a diet, it is an integrated wellness program that is designed to help people get into shape, feel great and find a lifestyle approach that will suit them and help bring them balance and self-acceptance. All on their own terms.</p>
<p>My goal is to help people become their ultimate selves. The aim is to help people get into shape and increase their levels of self confidence. What is great about this program is that it will break all the typical rules associated with weight loss and getting into shape. </p>
<p>You can still eat food that you love and find do exercise that you actually enjoy. There is a healthy alternative for every craving. Good food can still be indulgent and taste unhealthy. I can teach you how. This program is more about figuring out what works for you.</p>
<p>If you are unhappy with your body, then this program is for you. This is not a diet, it is a wellness program that will help you become your healthiest self while making you aware of the things that have lead to failure in the past. Most importantly, this program is designed to make you feel good and feel even better about yourself.</p>
<p>Individuals who purchase the program will also gain access to an online platform where they can get regular updates, self care ideas, recipes, yoga sequences, natural beauty news and tips and support. They will also have access to online yoga classes and workouts (which is why I included my yoga teacher training in the budget).</p>
<p>I have a vision and I have a plan. I have a good team in place that will help me make this project a reality, but what I don't have is funding. I need around  $10 000 to make this dream a reality and to do it the way I had envisioned.</p>
</div><div>
<p>The funds will be broken up as follows:</p>
<p>$2000 for the website and design. This will include:</p>
<p>- The website design</p>
<p>- The eBook design</p>
<p>- info-graphics</p>
<p>- Posters</p>
<p>$500 for a copy editor to edit my eBook.</p>
<p>$2000 to do my yoga teacher training.</p>
<p>$1000 for ingredients and decor for the photoshoot as well as location hire.</p>
<p>$1000 to do a photo shoot for my eBook and website content. This includes</p>
<p>- A food photo shoot and editing</p>
<p>- A yoga photo shoot and editing</p>
<p>- A beauty shoot and editing </p>
<p>$1500 to buy a professional camera and set up a photo studio. </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>$2000 so I can set up a home yoga studio and office to run online classes.</span></p>
<p>If I cannot raise all of the funding, then for now I will use all of the money raised to just complete the ebook and Website and then I will hold off on doing my yoga teacher training and setting up a home studio until I have saved enough money to complete that as I am determined to start teaching online eventually. </p>

<h3>How did we come up with Plan-Hangover?</h3>
<p>If drinking alcohol is in in your lifestyle, hangovers are something that never go away, and in most cases get worse the older you get. As founders of Plan-Hangover, we are by no means alcoholics, but we like to socially drink with friends. Yet every morning after, we dealt with the same issue. </p>
<p>There are tons of home remedies but no reliable brand in the marketplace that people can have as an easy go-to. </p>
<p>New brands keep entering the market and although they boast the ability to fight hangovers, they often don't do the job. The products we saw available were either a multivitamin with outrageous doses or a product packed with unnecessary chemicals that are known to be unhealthy. </p>
<p>Plan-Hangover was conceived in the way that Plan-B is known: a morning after pill to allow you to continue your life without a hitch. It is a simple idea yet there were no solutions available. So we took matters into our own hands and set up a research team who had extensive knowledge of supplements, minerals, herbs, and extracts to create our formula. </p>
<p>Plan-Hangover isn't just a supplement to give you energy or remove headaches. It's a supplement designed to combat both short-term and long-term effects of alcohol on the entire body. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512410654/mraeszcvuueoedyutyvv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We set our funding goal to an exact amount of $46550 that we need to fully launch the product. This is the cost for full manufacturing and distribution, because there are large minimum manufacturing requirements. This campaign is designed much like a preorder so we can afford to manufacture and fully launch Plan-Hangover. </p>
<p>Even if we reach our goal, all of the marketing and testing costs paid by our founders will still technically be losses. However, we know this product will be a success, and we need help funding the initial manufacturing costs!</p>
<p>Our perks are pretty simple. No t-shirts or gimmicks, just the product! While we do have the option for a virtual hi-five and support your decision to contribute in that way, we urge you to order the product itself and see the results first hand!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>A Product with Purpose</h3>
<p>In addition to growing our brand, we do have a social responsibility to give back through various charitable initiatives. There are tons of great non-profits and programs that aim to educate people about the danger of using alcohol irresponsibly. With our belief in our supplement to combat hangovers, a vital part will be helping others to drink responsibly and help those who don't have a safety net. </p>
<p>We pledge an absolute minimum of 5% of profits to be donated to charities that fit our vision. We will publish both the charities and the dollar amounts donated!</p>
<h3>The Product</h3>
<p>Plan-Hangover comes in a 10-capsule sleeve that is as easy to use and as discreet as a pack of gum. </p>
<p>We recommend taking one capsule with a full glass of water before bed after consuming alcohol, and one capsule with a glass of water in the morning. If you forget to take it before bed, we recommend taking both capsules in the morning with a full glass of water to make sure to get the full dose of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and extracts that make our product so useful. </p>
<p>Through our tests, the steps of using Plan-Hangover will alleviate hangover symptoms and reduce alcohol's negative effect on the body.  </p>
<p>Now of course the most important part...</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't contribute, we appreciate you reading this far. Please know that you can always spread the word to your network or use the Indiegogo share tools to help us reach our goal!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>FAQ's</h3>
<p><strong>Are the capsules vegan and gluten free?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, our capsules are made from vegetable materials opposed to the commonly used gelatin capsules. All ingredients including the capsule are gluten free. </p>
<p><strong>When will they be shipped?</strong></p>
<p>The main point of our campaign on Indiegogo is to understand demand and raise capital to assist in our first major manufacturing run. We plan to begin the 4-week manufacturing process early December while the campaign is still running. So they should be completed and shipped to your door by the second week in January. We will make sure to keep everyone that places an order updated!</p>
<p><strong>Why are your products better than others on the market?</strong></p>
<p>There are various factors:</p>
<p>Many other products come as a shot, drink, or powder that cost $5-10 per serving, which is crazy expensive to us and anyone we've talked to. </p>
<p>Other products have tons of unnatural ingredients used to add color, flavor, and effects of a ""hangover cure"". We strived to create a not only a great product, but a great company with core values. </p>
<p>Finally, Plan-Hangover a is a supplement that comes in a box the size of a pack of gum, so it is incredibly convenient in addition to its effect on hangovers.</p>
<p><strong>Other products have caffeine, why don't yours?</strong></p>
<p>Caffeine dehydrates you. Since major hangover symptoms are a result of dehydration, we don't add something that will counteract our mission! That's why our ingredients aim to keep you alert and boost energy without caffeine (we love coffee, so if you're like us just wait a few hours into the day so Plan-Hangover can bring your body back to it's normal feeling). </p>
<p><strong>Have your products been tested?</strong></p>
<p>Of course! We have had multiple blind testing groups sample our product both alone and against home remedies and other ""hangover cure"" products on the market after a night of consuming alcohol. We have completed everything up to large scale manufacturing, which is why we're here!</p>
<p><strong>I am interested in purchasing a wholesale order or a larger bulk than offered on Indiegogo, is that possible?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely, please send any inquires regarding this to contact@planhangover.com.</p>

<h2>Operation: Help</h2>
<p>Hi, I am Luis. I am a physician and specialist in general surgery. During my practice, I met some fantastic humans that need treatment for their diseases, but they sadly they can't afford it. I had helped some of them in the past with my resources, but this time they need more expensive surgeries. That's why I work together with my colleague Doctor Arturo. He is a surgeon, too and we both want to help these people because they came to us for help. But we realized we need more people to spread the voice if we are willing to impact more lives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the past, we both began ""Operation Help"" with the primary purpose to give surgery for hernia repair. We want them to be operated by professionals, with high-quality materials, and in an excellent hospital (they deserve it, even if they can't afford it). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>These people are daughters, mothers, fathers, and a lot of them work on their own to support their families. The hernia they have causes pain to them and interfere with their work. That's why it is important what we want to do. That's why your help is essential. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How can you help these nine people?</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>To give them a proper treatment we need US$11,000. With that money we can provide:</p>
<p>-Hospitalization</p>
<p>-Well equipped operating rooms</p>
<p>-Care by professionals (anesthesiologist, surgeons, nurses, internal medicine specialists, ¡etc)</p>
<p>-Laboratory test before surgery</p>
<p>-Medical evaluation before and after surgery</p>
<p>-Antibiotics and other medications </p>
<p>-Food for their families (it is normal in our culture that one family member stays beside the patient). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The funds are expected to cover all the cost of the treatment, so they don't n have to pay for anything. In change, they will be much thankful to you because of your help. They will continue to protect their own families. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The impact</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>These people are Guatemalan, workers (informal sector), students, sons, daughters, fathers, and mothers. All of them are invaluable to their families. The hernia causes pain to them. It interferes with their normal activities and their works. With your help, you give them freedom. You are giving to them the freedom they need to move, freedom of pain to support their families and their communities. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why we?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Like surgeons, Arturo and I know the pain they are dealing with these health problems. Also, we had evaluated them (with no cost) to be sure that they have a hernia and the surgery is the best treatment for them. We had designed this project that they will not pay anything because we met the providers of surgical materials, we know the disease and, the most important, we know these good people who need help. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How can you be part of this project?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Your support is invaluable. Any help that you can give is essential. Your monetary donation allows us to accomplish this dream for these amazing people. But your support in social networks, chats and your community to share in order we can reach the goal all together will be very valuable. </p>

This is me a few years back, taking a class at the Whole Foods Culinary Center in Austin. Soon afterwards, I enrolled in Escoffier Culinary School.Though my professional background is in digital marketing, cookery has been my passion for as long as I can remember. It's naturally how I show my love to the people I care about.Through the years, my family and friends often made remarks about opening a restaurant. I never dreamed I'd actually do it, but after a life-altering event brought me to Corpus Christi to be closer to family, a group of people came together to help me do just that.There was a beloved space downtown that closed a couple of years ago. I fell in love with it, mostly because it reminded me so much of Austin. A friend suggested that I open it and that is when the adventure began. I had no idea how it would work, but with lots of determination, many successes, a few mistakes and tons of passion, we created a beautiful timeline of memories (and wisdom!). The video above are some highlights of the food we created during our time at Fresh!.My biggest focus was on bringing a higher awareness for healthy, minimally processed foods.Let me explain.You see, around 2002, I began reading about high-fructose corn syrup and decided to cut it out of my diet, mostly by eliminating sodas. A few days after stopping the soda, I awoke with no brain fog.I had become so accustomed to waking up groggy, I actually never associated it with something that I might be eating or drinking.This began my journey into reading labels. What else was I putting into my body...into my family's bodies...that might not be the best?My voracious label reading meant hours at the grocery store. What was once a fun ritual for our family turned into hours of boredom, mostly for the kids. They began to really despise going to the store with me, but I was insatiable. I really wanted to understand everything we were consuming.I began to wonder how we had gotten so far off track with our diet. For instance, how and why is milk homogenized? You mean the naturally occurring fat globules are pressure forced through a fine sieve so they are literally transformed into a substance that will stay suspended in the milk? And why? And how does that affect the way we digest it?Ahem..rampant-lactose-intolerance...Sorry, didn't mean to get into specifics.There are a lot of other things I began to question and came to my own conclusions, one being, eating as clean as possible while keeping as much ultra-processing as possible out of my and my family's diet.Fortunately, I spent many years in Austin where there was an abundance of growers, food producers, restaurants and grocery stores that provided food that I could buy and golly-gee-whiz, not have to decipher labels!I'll stop right here because I was about to post a bunch of facts and memes about processed food, you know, to help everyone understand why I'm so passionate about this topic, when I realized, the people who don't really believe it won't be swayed by my uncanny, ninja-like Googling tactics.So, at this time, I shall appeal to those who:
Do understand
Want to understand
Might not understand, but know that many of us need to make some changes to our every day eating habits
With that said, if you've ever had a taste of my homemades (I love using the term ""homemades"" because, Silver Linings Playbook)Yeah, come on, Dad, be nice. Come on, she's making crabby snacks and homemades! ~ Pat...you'd be hard pressed not to know that most of what I make is healthy, minimally processed, and without the use of microwaves. That's right, we are a microwave-free zone.We also refuse to use:
High Fructose Corn Syrup
Hydrogenated Oils
Refined Sugar
Artificial Sweeteners
Non-organic breads and flour
After I lost 45 pounds in 2010, I kept it off for three years, mostly by going gluten-free. My joints swelled up and I became lethargic after eating (what I thought to be the culprit) gluten. What I later found out (after asking, why is everyone having such a problem with gluten all of a sudden?) is that it actually WASN'T the gluten, it was the PESTICIDES that were giving me the reactions.Anyway, that's a little about me, my background and what we've accomplished so far. And we're not even close to being done •ᴗ•With your help, not only do you get to feel good about supporting us in the food space, you'll also get some prizes that are on fleek.Ya, I said it.So, are you ready?

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3><strong>A Sense Of Urgency</strong></h3><p>Since beginning the book, the need which it seeks to address has become painfully clear. Last month, I attended the funeral of one of my army colleagues. He died too early having taken his own life.</p><p>During the short space of time since I commenced the crowdfunding campaign, unexpectedly, I too have had my own struggles unrelated to writing this book, and have relied heavily on the help of the veteran network as I found myself in position best described as having the wheels falling off and needing the help of others. This ironically gave me an opportunity to effectively road test this book which I can say with confidence is based on lived experience of myself and others.</p><p>Coming back from loss and the journey towards recovery takes time. It takes hard work, discipline and commitment. But it is possible. This book is empathetic to that journey and at the same time very practical in how to get back into the game and live your purpose.</p><h3>A New Approach To Mindfulness</h3><p>At its heart, this is a health book which considers our wellbeing as a holistic journey. Mental health is a very important aspect, which thrives when we maintain our physical health as part of this equation. To live your purpose is to live fully. You deserve it, and the world needs the best you can bring. </p><p>This book is focused on a new approach to discovering your strength through mindfulness. I have drawn upon advice and input from some of the best teachers and leaders that I know, and I hope that you might allow me to share this with you.</p><p>The book highlights the importance of mental health as a fundamental foundation upon which to live fully, supported through three pillars of health, transition and belonging.</p><h3>Changing The Trend - Inflection Points </h3><p>One of the lessons I have learnt is that if as little as 10 minutes a day is dedicated to the work of restoring yourself towards living your purpose, over time you will be amazed at your progress. </p><p>The idea of the book is grounded in a sequence of what I am referring to as 100 “<u><i>inflection points</i></u>”. An inflection point is a change where a trend goes from the negative to the positive. Applying focus and momentum to this process of inflection points, this book is a toolkit for finding and living your purpose providing a very practical 14 week journal to enable change for the better. </p><p>The framework of these inflection points is what makes this book different. They are tested and proven to have a positive impact, and my hope is that they will help you and those you most care about to improve your own wellbeing and live your purpose fully.</p><h3>Encouraging Reviews</h3><p>Reviews from earlier drafts to the book have been extremely encouraging, such as ""<i>Beautifully Written - Great Insight</i>”.</p><p>I’ll let their words speak for themselves with a brief summary of some of the feedback received: ”<i>Refreshingly frank - will touch a lot of people"" </i></p><p><i>""Makes one want to keep reading!"" </i></p><p><i>""A grand endeavour"" </i></p><p><i>""Leaves the reader wanting more"" </i></p><p><i>""This was amazing"" </i></p><p><i>""Love it"" </i></p><p><i>""Relevant</i>"" ...and many more echoing support for the work.</p><p>How you decide to use the book is up to you, as it designed with a versatility to be suitable as an elegant coffee table book featuring a photoessay to complement the writing as much as it is also a personal diary. Importantly, the substance of the book delivers a practical handbook of tested ideas to help you to Live Your Purpose.</p><p>The premise of the book “Live Your Purpose: On coming back from loss” is that we don’t need to live our lives at sea, as it were. A better life awaits, and we should strive to live that life.</p><p>Creating a resource that will help others is an end worthy of itself. My sense from the feedback I have received to date is that it will be of benefit to many. If this book helps you in some small way, then my toil will have been entirely worthwhile.</p><h3>A Marathon Journey</h3><p>The origins of this book was a marathon journey, literally, which culminated with the running of the Marine Corps Marathon last year in Washington DC. Many stories came from that experience which feature in the book.</p><p>I’m drawing upon the experiences of others to highlight the utility of the book to illustrate how different people in different circumstances have met the challenges of adversity, uncertainty and vulnerability that resulted from loss. </p><h3>A little about myself - From Soldier To Social Entrepreneur</h3><p>My name is Matt Jones. I am a retired Australian army officer and veteran. I enjoyed my service with the Australian Army which was lengthy and with such a varied range of experiences that are too great to list here. I have never spent much time talking about my time in Defence with my civilian friends, but it strikes me that when questions are asked, the focus is often on the big ticket items, and not the lived day-to-day experience. It is understandable that people would want to hear about adventure, excitement, danger, intrigue and controversy. But in reality, it is often the day to day grind that was the most meaningful part of my service in Army.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512630237/bhmvg9zxbkjzswaq9ria.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>I’m not going to pretend it was perfect, because it wasn’t. But there were good times. The best part of Army service is unquestionably the people. It is always the people that make a difference, and for me it was an opportunity to work alongside many of Australia’s finest - the men and women of the Australian Defence Force.</p><p>Speaking for myself, after leaving the ADF I must admit to having been ‘at sea’ for many years. It is a jarring contrast with my life in uniform, and for the most part a secret and unseen struggle that few people were witness to as a result of my military service.</p><p>In the years after leaving Army, I turned my attention to making impact through running as a way of addressing key matters of social change that I thought were important. I 2009, I ran what I called the 9 City Bridge Run where I ran nine sub-marathons in nine cities across five countries as a stunt to open a conversation asking how resilience and wellbeing might be a counterpoint to depression, anxiety and suicide following the tragic deaths of a number of friends.  I don’t know how successful I was in undertaking that endeavour, but this book is the culmination of that effort which I had perhaps naively self-funded back in 2009.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512630265/plunycpkf6ygw4ne2djo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The idea to write this book originated while reflecting on the Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington following the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington D.C. last year. I ended up running the marathon following the suggestion of a friend during my participation in the 22 Push Up Challenge. For those who aren’t aware, the 22 Push Up Challenge sought to raise awareness of the unacceptably high rates of suicide among the veteran community. I ran the marathon as part of a team supporting US charity The Mission Continues which seeks to empower veterans adjust to life at home to find purpose through community impact. For me, that experience was profound.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512630177/musuxvppi39ysewfbabj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>A significant event that shaped my thinking was in part the consequence of insights from running the marathon. In April this year, it dawned upon me that I was struggling with an anxiety condition and not actually coping very well. I decided to make this public knowledge as a way of finding a path to my healing. Through that process, my good friend Greg Read suggested that I consider expressing my experience through art, and the result was the award winning tapestry “I Require Assistance” borrowing the symbol of the maritime signal flag describing the same message.  </p><p>The genesis of this book is based on my own reflections, but this book is not about me. It is about us all. I’m inviting you to be part of this conversation.</p><h3>Pompey Elliott Veterans Forum</h3><p>One of the ways to support veterans in crisis is to engage the veteran community in dialogue. In Australia, a missing piece to this conversation is what I’m referring to as the “<i><u>Veteran-Civilian Dialogue</u></i>”. For too long, we have focused on respectful ceremony and wreath laying but not on actually talking to veterans who live amongst us in our community. </p><p>I’m proposing to address this using the book as a platform to convene the inaugural <i><strong><u>Pompey Elloitt Veterans Forum</u></strong></i> in 2018 focusing on engagement of local government and business. The forum will focus on enabling this ‘veteran-civilian dialogue’ in the service of improving community wellbeing. Pompey Elliott was among Australia’s most renowned wartime generals from the First World War who, as a Major-General in 1931, committed suicide. His death is a tragic remainder that these issues are not new, and that even the most capable leaders are not immune from needing help from others.</p><div> </div><h3>Different Ways To Support </h3><p>Here are some of the other ways you could invest in this project other than purchasing a copy of the book:</p><h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Recognition</h3><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Every contributor to the crowdfunding campaign will have their name included in the book “<i>Live Your Purpose: On coming back from loss</i>” as a thank you for helping to make this initiative possible. If you prefer to remain anonymous, that is fine too.</p><h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Soldier’s Five</h3><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">In the Army, a “Soldier’s Five” describes an abbreviated briefing containing only the essential information needed for someone who needs to act decisively under exacting conditions of extreme pressure. This Soldier’s 5 is no different, providing a practical précis emailed to you daily for 100 days across a 14 week period to use as a quick-reference resource of the essential elements based on the 100 inflection points contained within “Live Your Purpose: On coming back from loss”. </p><h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Mind Your Head - Plus 10 Audiobook</h3><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The Plus 10 Audiobook delivers a collections of recorded guided meditations to promote your wellbeing through a greater awareness of mindfulness complementing the 100 Inflection Points upon which the book Live Your Purpose is based. It is about you giving yourself the best of you and the best of your time for ten minutes a day.</p><h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Live Your Purpose: the book</h3><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The core focus to the crowdfunding campaign, a beautifully designed health book and personal diary containing a toolkit with substance to help you Live Your Purpose.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">You can elect to purchase the book for yourself, or gift a copy to benefit veterans in crisis. During the campaign, updates will be made about the progress to gift copies of these books and once bundles are gathered enabling gifting.</p><h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Give One, Get One</h3><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Elect to invest in two books, one for you and another for a mate. A companion set that allows for opening a conversation, or even gifting one book or both books to veterans in crisis. </p><h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Restorative Fitness</h3><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Physical fitness and mental fitness are intertwined on many levels. Both are very important, and critical for us to live our best life. Investing in a Restorative Fitness Session with Matt Jones, a qualified Personal Trainer (Certificate IV Personal Trainer, with qualifications extending to restorative needs of Special Populations [relates to people recovering from injury and illness], pilates, AquaAerobics, boxing) to talk through your plan for your own restorative fitness. Conducted by phone or in person, depending on location, at a time most convenient to you. A copy of Live Your Purpose is included to help inspire you to action based on the Inflection Points.</p><h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Workshop - The Courage To Continue</h3><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Invest in a workshop tailored to meet the needs of 20 people which includes copies of “Live Your Purpose: On coming back from loss” for each participant. Delivery will be conducted using appropriate medium if transport costs are excessive. The cost of the venue and food/beverages are not included. A workshop can also be gifted to be delivered through a reputable organisation supporting the needs of veterans in crisis. </p><h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Supporting The Pompey Elliott Veterans Forum</h3><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Government agencies, businesses or individuals can support the Pompey Elliott Veterans Forum as part of an engaged network committed to improving community wellbeing.</p><h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Sponsor the Pompey Elliott Veterans Forum</h3><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">This is an invitation to become the sponsor for the Pompey Elliott Veterans Forum as they are conducted throughout 2018. Further discussion as to what this entails is welcome through contacting Matt Jones directly.</p><h3>The Publishing Process</h3><p>I am publishing the book in Korea working with an outstanding designer who is highly respected internationally. There are two key advantages for the process of design, production and distribution of the book in Korea. The quality is of a high standard, and through my contacts the process is more affordable than elsewhere. Additionally, the cost of postage in Korea is very competitive and exceedingly more affordable than Australia Post.</p><h3>Raising A Battalion (Of Books) For Deployment</h3><p>Through the sale of the book during this crowdfunding campaign, my aspiration is to “raise a battalion (of books) for deployment”. My aim is that together, we can deploy this battalion of 500 or more books to engage a much needed conversation about our mental health and wellbeing so as to generate positive impact. </p><p>When selecting a book to purchase you have the option to receive a copy of the book for yourself or otherwise gift it to a pool of books that will be gifted to veterans in crisis who are unable to purchase a copy but might most benefit from the book. Gifted books will be distributed through reputable organisations delivering excellent programs for veterans, often on a small scale and unseen by the media. They are mostly led by seasoned veterans who draw upon their own experiences. Through contributing gifted books, it helps them to engage with veterans in crisis at the point where maximum impact can be generated through conversation, care and camaraderie. As bundles of gifted books are accrued during the campaign, they will be gifted to organisations and this will be communicated with supporters. Accountability and transparency are essential.</p><h3>Funding The Book</h3><p>I’m funding this book through pledges to this crowdfunding campaign you are reading now. The way it works is that by pre-purchasing a copy of the book “Live Your Purpose: On coming back from loss”, together we can fund this book and make it available as a resource to many.</p><p>The book is available here for US$25 plus postage.</p><p>All of the risk is on me as this is an “all-or-nothing” crowdfunding campaign. If I am unsuccessful in achieving the amount, all of the money is returned to those making pledges.

I can’t achieve this outcome on my own. Neither is it achieved through the top-down appointment by a large institution. This reflects the conversation that is necessary in our communities about the challenges of mental health. It is up to us and it involves the collaboration of many people. Every contribution matters, no matter how small.</p><p>Two points to note on the pie chart above regarding the breakdown of costs.</p><p>Firstly, all funds received to achieve the funding goal go directly toward achieving this mission of a resource for veterans in crisis, and secondly through the conversation that ensues to engage the veteran community in a robust veteran-civilian dialogue. There are no commissions or salaries paid from the funding received.</p><p>Secondly, the crowdfunding fees might seem steep, and no one likes to pay fees. These fees are taken directly by Indiegogo prior to the distribution of funding should the goal be successful. Click here to see a link on the Indiegogo site explaining the breakdown of fees.</p><h3>The Challenge</h3><p>I have made crowdfunding objective for this project “all-or-nothing” which in simple terms means that if I don’t reach my entire funding goal, then no contributions will be made by anyone but neither will the book be published.</p><p>The objectives for the campaign are directly linked to the funding goal. If the entire goal is achieved, the book will be funded and the project will go ahead. We can have impact if the funding goal is reached.</p><p>If the funding goal is not reached, all funds will be returned through Indiegogo with none being received by myself. I will only receive funds from the project in the event that the funding goal is achieved, and then only after the campaign concludes in line with the dispersement policy timeline.</p><p>Through the campaign, I am striving for maximum impact. The more books that are sold, the more impact that can be generated through this conversation. To that end, I’m looking for innovative ways of broadening this conversation that will deliver impact. If you have a good idea, please let me know. </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Many of the lessons that are included in the book come from insights shared on social media during the 22 Push Up Challenge and training for the Marine Corps Marathon last year. There has been benefit in sharing those insights, however these lessons need to be compiled and not lost, hence the book.</p><p>On a personal level, this endeavour has been entirely worthwhile, even if it has taken up a considerable among of my time and energy. As much as the impact I have experience might be worthwhile, this campaign is not about me.</p><p>The impact that might be achieved through the “raising of a battalion (of books) for deployment (about 500 books)” is the stimulation of hundreds of opportunities to help improve the wellbeing of many individuals and communities. In reality, this is a modest achievement compared to the impact that could be generated through the production of this book over the long term.</p><p>The intention is to open a broad-reaching conversation involving local governments and businesses that will frame a much needed veteran-civilian dialogue which I am referring to as the Pompey Elliott Veterans Forum. That forum is but on avenue towards bringing a new approach to mindfulness. This new approach to mindfulness draws upon lived experiences and lessons from the community as a whole through which a much needed alchemy can be generated. </p><p>Perhaps the impact of that is sought is best communicated through the word “Restoration”, articulated superbly through words of a friend, American thought-leader, activist and author Paul Hawken: </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>“The act of restoration involves recognizing that something has been lost, used up, or removed. To restore is to bring back or return something to its original state. This can involve rebuilding, repairing, removing corruptions and mistakes; it allows for the idea of bringing a person or place or group back to health and equilibrium; it can mean returning something that originally belonged to someone else, whether it is returning lands taken from other cultures, or dignity stolen by bureaucratic regulations and officialdom; it emcompasses the idea of reviving and rejuvenating connections, relationships, and responsibilities. Honor can even be retrieved. It can be as simple as replacing what has aged and died away. Above all, it means to heal, to make whole, to reweave broken strands and threads into a social fabric that honors and nurtures life around it. To restore is to make something well again. It is mending the world. People have to believe there will be a future in order to look forward.”</i></p><p>This act of restoration applies to us all. We have to weave a stronger fabric where veterans are very much part of the communities where they live. </p><h3>Risks</h3><p>Perhaps the biggest risk I face through this campaign is sharing my personal stories of loss publicly, which requires me to overcome my own sense of shame and embarrassment. During the research for this book, I have read widely, including the author Brené Brown whose work on shame, vulnerability and trust is compelling. What I have discovered is that through embracing vulnerability I stand to encounter strength despite the risk involved. Of course, this involves exercising trust to combat shame, and as Brené Brown writes ‘you are only as sick as your secrets’. Through this process I am forced to confront the reality of my journey which at times has taken me to places I never expected to visit. </p><p>Another challenge I face is not to attribute my own value from the success or failure of the crowdfunding process to realise this book. The book is about serving others through addressing a challenge confronted by many. By accepting this challenge, I demonstrate the ability we have to try things that may result in short term failure. Both innovation and creativity are grounded in the process of failure, and only good can come from pursuing success in this crowdfunding campaign.</p><p>“<i>During the crowdfunding process, I will be looking after my own wellbeing as a priority by maintaining a good routine of sleep hygiene, yoga, meditation, diet, water intake and exercise. In addition, I will exploring this theme through conversations and counselling with friends and professionals alike. I will be tasting my own medicine.</i>” I wrote those words prior to the beginning of the crowdfunding campaign, shortly after which I found myself struggling on a number of levels. It has been a good and a humbling process to accept help as it has been offered, often in circumstances that have necessitated me to put the focus on the crowdfunding on the back-burner. The point is that whatever falls across our path, there is always a way forward. Find the courage to continue. Live Your Purpose.</p><p>Please help me to live my purpose by supporting this book.</p><h3>Sharing Is Caring</h3><p>Please share information about this campaign through social media, to the traditional media, in conversation with your friends, and with your local library. The sharing tools on this site make that very easy. Thank you!</p><p>This is an important conversation for us all. Please open this conversation with your friends.</p><h3>Thank You</h3><p>There is one thing left to say and that is that I appreciate you being part of this conversation. Thank you. </p></div>","A Sense Of UrgencySince beginning the book, the need which it seeks to address has become painfully clear. Last month, I attended the funeral of one of my army colleagues. He died too early having taken his own life.During the short space of time since I commenced the crowdfunding campaign, unexpectedly, I too have had my own struggles unrelated to writing this book, and have relied heavily on the help of the veteran network as I found myself in position best described as having the wheels falling off and needing the help of others. This ironically gave me an opportunity to effectively road test this book which I can say with confidence is based on lived experience of myself and others.Coming back from loss and the journey towards recovery takes time. It takes hard work, discipline and commitment. But it is possible. This book is empathetic to that journey and at the same time very practical in how to get back into the game and live your purpose.A New Approach To MindfulnessAt its heart, this is a health book which considers our wellbeing as a holistic journey. Mental health is a very important aspect, which thrives when we maintain our physical health as part of this equation. To live your purpose is to live fully. You deserve it, and the world needs the best you can bring. This book is focused on a new approach to discovering your strength through mindfulness. I have drawn upon advice and input from some of the best teachers and leaders that I know, and I hope that you might allow me to share this with you.The book highlights the importance of mental health as a fundamental foundation upon which to live fully, supported through three pillars of health, transition and belonging.Changing The Trend - Inflection Points One of the lessons I have learnt is that if as little as 10 minutes a day is dedicated to the work of restoring yourself towards living your purpose, over time you will be amazed at your progress. The idea of the book is grounded in a sequence of what I am referring to as 100 “inflection points”. An inflection point is a change where a trend goes from the negative to the positive. Applying focus and momentum to this process of inflection points, this book is a toolkit for finding and living your purpose providing a very practical 14 week journal to enable change for the better. The framework of these inflection points is what makes this book different. They are tested and proven to have a positive impact, and my hope is that they will help you and those you most care about to improve your own wellbeing and live your purpose fully.Encouraging ReviewsReviews from earlier drafts to the book have been extremely encouraging, such as ""Beautifully Written - Great Insight”.I’ll let their words speak for themselves with a brief summary of some of the feedback received: ”Refreshingly frank - will touch a lot of people"" ""Makes one want to keep reading!"" ""A grand endeavour"" ""Leaves the reader wanting more"" ""This was amazing"" ""Love it"" ""Relevant"" ...and many more echoing support for the work.How you decide to use the book is up to you, as it designed with a versatility to be suitable as an elegant coffee table book featuring a photoessay to complement the writing as much as it is also a personal diary. Importantly, the substance of the book delivers a practical handbook of tested ideas to help you to Live Your Purpose.The premise of the book “Live Your Purpose: On coming back from loss” is that we don’t need to live our lives at sea, as it were. A better life awaits, and we should strive to live that life.Creating a resource that will help others is an end worthy of itself. My sense from the feedback I have received to date is that it will be of benefit to many. If this book helps you in some small way, then my toil will have been entirely worthwhile.A Marathon JourneyThe origins of this book was a marathon journey, literally, which culminated with the running of the Marine Corps Marathon last year in Washington DC. Many stories came from that experience which feature in the book.I’m drawing upon the experiences of others to highlight the utility of the book to illustrate how different people in different circumstances have met the challenges of adversity, uncertainty and vulnerability that resulted from loss. A little about myself - From Soldier To Social EntrepreneurMy name is Matt Jones. I am a retired Australian army officer and veteran. I enjoyed my service with the Australian Army which was lengthy and with such a varied range of experiences that are too great to list here. I have never spent much time talking about my time in Defence with my civilian friends, but it strikes me that when questions are asked, the focus is often on the big ticket items, and not the lived day-to-day experience. It is understandable that people would want to hear about adventure, excitement, danger, intrigue and controversy. But in reality, it is often the day to day grind that was the most meaningful part of my service in Army.I’m not going to pretend it was perfect, because it wasn’t. But there were good times. The best part of Army service is unquestionably the people. It is always the people that make a difference, and for me it was an opportunity to work alongside many of Australia’s finest - the men and women of the Australian Defence Force.Speaking for myself, after leaving the ADF I must admit to having been ‘at sea’ for many years. It is a jarring contrast with my life in uniform, and for the most part a secret and unseen struggle that few people were witness to as a result of my military service.In the years after leaving Army, I turned my attention to making impact through running as a way of addressing key matters of social change that I thought were important. I 2009, I ran what I called the 9 City Bridge Run where I ran nine sub-marathons in nine cities across five countries as a stunt to open a conversation asking how resilience and wellbeing might be a counterpoint to depression, anxiety and suicide following the tragic deaths of a number of friends.  I don’t know how successful I was in undertaking that endeavour, but this book is the culmination of that effort which I had perhaps naively self-funded back in 2009.The idea to write this book originated while reflecting on the Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington following the Marine Corps Marathon in Washington D.C. last year. I ended up running the marathon following the suggestion of a friend during my participation in the 22 Push Up Challenge. For those who aren’t aware, the 22 Push Up Challenge sought to raise awareness of the unacceptably high rates of suicide among the veteran community. I ran the marathon as part of a team supporting US charity The Mission Continues which seeks to empower veterans adjust to life at home to find purpose through community impact. For me, that experience was profound.A significant event that shaped my thinking was in part the consequence of insights from running the marathon. In April this year, it dawned upon me that I was struggling with an anxiety condition and not actually coping very well. I decided to make this public knowledge as a way of finding a path to my healing. Through that process, my good friend Greg Read suggested that I consider expressing my experience through art, and the result was the award winning tapestry “I Require Assistance” borrowing the symbol of the maritime signal flag describing the same message.  The genesis of this book is based on my own reflections, but this book is not about me. It is about us all. I’m inviting you to be part of this conversation.Pompey Elliott Veterans ForumOne of the ways to support veterans in crisis is to engage the veteran community in dialogue. In Australia, a missing piece to this conversation is what I’m referring to as the “Veteran-Civilian Dialogue”. For too long, we have focused on respectful ceremony and wreath laying but not on actually talking to veterans who live amongst us in our community. I’m proposing to address this using the book as a platform to convene the inaugural Pompey Elloitt Veterans Forum in 2018 focusing on engagement of local government and business. The forum will focus on enabling this ‘veteran-civilian dialogue’ in the service of improving community wellbeing. Pompey Elliott was among Australia’s most renowned wartime generals from the First World War who, as a Major-General in 1931, committed suicide. His death is a tragic remainder that these issues are not new, and that even the most capable leaders are not immune from needing help from others. Different Ways To Support Here are some of the other ways you could invest in this project other than purchasing a copy of the book:RecognitionEvery contributor to the crowdfunding campaign will have their name included in the book “Live Your Purpose: On coming back from loss” as a thank you for helping to make this initiative possible. If you prefer to remain anonymous, that is fine too.Soldier’s FiveIn the Army, a “Soldier’s Five” describes an abbreviated briefing containing only the essential information needed for someone who needs to act decisively under exacting conditions of extreme pressure. This Soldier’s 5 is no different, providing a practical précis emailed to you daily for 100 days across a 14 week period to use as a quick-reference resource of the essential elements based on the 100 inflection points contained within “Live Your Purpose: On coming back from loss”. Mind Your Head - Plus 10 AudiobookThe Plus 10 Audiobook delivers a collections of recorded guided meditations to promote your wellbeing through a greater awareness of mindfulness complementing the 100 Inflection Points upon which the book Live Your Purpose is based. It is about you giving yourself the best of you and the best of your time for ten minutes a day.Live Your Purpose: the bookThe core focus to the crowdfunding campaign, a beautifully designed health book and personal diary containing a toolkit with substance to help you Live Your Purpose.You can elect to purchase the book for yourself, or gift a copy to benefit veterans in crisis. During the campaign, updates will be made about the progress to gift copies of these books and once bundles are gathered enabling gifting.Give One, Get OneElect to invest in two books, one for you and another for a mate. A companion set that allows for opening a conversation, or even gifting one book or both books to veterans in crisis. Restorative FitnessPhysical fitness and mental fitness are intertwined on many levels. Both are very important, and critical for us to live our best life. Investing in a Restorative Fitness Session with Matt Jones, a qualified Personal Trainer (Certificate IV Personal Trainer, with qualifications extending to restorative needs of Special Populations [relates to people recovering from injury and illness], pilates, AquaAerobics, boxing) to talk through your plan for your own restorative fitness. Conducted by phone or in person, depending on location, at a time most convenient to you. A copy of Live Your Purpose is included to help inspire you to action based on the Inflection Points.Workshop - The Courage To ContinueInvest in a workshop tailored to meet the needs of 20 people which includes copies of “Live Your Purpose: On coming back from loss” for each participant. Delivery will be conducted using appropriate medium if transport costs are excessive. The cost of the venue and food/beverages are not included. A workshop can also be gifted to be delivered through a reputable organisation supporting the needs of veterans in crisis. Supporting The Pompey Elliott Veterans ForumGovernment agencies, businesses or individuals can support the Pompey Elliott Veterans Forum as part of an engaged network committed to improving community wellbeing.Sponsor the Pompey Elliott Veterans ForumThis is an invitation to become the sponsor for the Pompey Elliott Veterans Forum as they are conducted throughout 2018. Further discussion as to what this entails is welcome through contacting Matt Jones directly.The Publishing ProcessI am publishing the book in Korea working with an outstanding designer who is highly respected internationally. There are two key advantages for the process of design, production and distribution of the book in Korea. The quality is of a high standard, and through my contacts the process is more affordable than elsewhere. Additionally, the cost of postage in Korea is very competitive and exceedingly more affordable than Australia Post.Raising A Battalion (Of Books) For DeploymentThrough the sale of the book during this crowdfunding campaign, my aspiration is to “raise a battalion (of books) for deployment”. My aim is that together, we can deploy this battalion of 500 or more books to engage a much needed conversation about our mental health and wellbeing so as to generate positive impact. When selecting a book to purchase you have the option to receive a copy of the book for yourself or otherwise gift it to a pool of books that will be gifted to veterans in crisis who are unable to purchase a copy but might most benefit from the book. Gifted books will be distributed through reputable organisations delivering excellent programs for veterans, often on a small scale and unseen by the media. They are mostly led by seasoned veterans who draw upon their own experiences. Through contributing gifted books, it helps them to engage with veterans in crisis at the point where maximum impact can be generated through conversation, care and camaraderie. As bundles of gifted books are accrued during the campaign, they will be gifted to organisations and this will be communicated with supporters. Accountability and transparency are essential.Funding The BookI’m funding this book through pledges to this crowdfunding campaign you are reading now. The way it works is that by pre-purchasing a copy of the book “Live Your Purpose: On coming back from loss”, together we can fund this book and make it available as a resource to many.The book is available here for US$25 plus postage.All of the risk is on me as this is an “all-or-nothing” crowdfunding campaign. If I am unsuccessful in achieving the amount, all of the money is returned to those making pledges. I receive nothing unless the campaign is successful.I appreciate that not everyone will be in a position to contribute. If that is you, thanks for reading, and I really value your being part of this journey. You too can make a difference by forwarding this link on social media. Thank you for your support.I’m seeking to raise $9075 which is the amount needed to cover essential costs in raising this “battalion of books”.All funds received are directed towards the production and distribution of this book so as to meet the two core objectives of creating a resource for veterans in crisis, along with engaging the veteran community through a robust veteran-civilian dialogue.You can see the breakdown of costs outlined below: One of the strengths of crowdfunding is that it requires the collaboration of many to make the outcome possible.

My name is Brandi.  I am a 42 year old mom to a boy that was born with some medical conditions that requires continual assistance in life. He was born with ADHD, OCD, ODD (Oppositional Defiance Disorder) which makes him very busy! So why not throw in some Down Syndrome! My 16 year old son, Braedyn,  is a 'super high functioning’ teenager who loves sports and taking pictures, but pines to make some friends. <br/><br/>However, not all children fit at school,  and because my son struggles daily to find his identity in this world, he's been ""dismissed"" from most things that children are allowed to partake in like public school and special olympics. And since there is no place to hang out daily in our community, we'd like to change that and create a place. <br/> <br/><strong>WHAT WE WANT TO DO</strong><br/><br/>We're tired of living in a lonely world. So, we'd like to share our daily life activities with others and enjoy the laughter! We'd like to make long lasting memories and create a safe, comfortable day space for people with disabilities in our community. Currently, most special needs adults hang out at the local, low-end department store, since there is nothing ‘to do’ in this town. There is no space dedicated to just people with special needs. So, we want to offer a safe, fun environment, providing the necessary social skills one requires to feel valued in this world. People with disabilities just want to be accepted for who they are. For that is what we all need in life, to feel secure and belong somewhere.<br/>We want to bring CO-OP housing to our town of Campbell River. So the thought process is to build the two together. Those who would want to live in this CO-OP model would be apart of the special needs adventure center. <br/><br/><b>SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION</b><br/><br/>In addition, this past year, our family got to experience the Canadian national housing crisis. An actual lack of housing forced our family of 3 with special needs child, into my parents 5th wheel on their lot, for eight months. Our local Member of Parliament even referred to our family on September 25th, 2017 in the House of Commons when she spoke about her bill C-325 (An Act to amend the Canadian Bill of Rights regarding a right to housing.) </p><p><br/>In our search for a sustainable and affordable rental home, I came up with the idea of having a village of small cabins. (Edit: originally it was yurts, until someone told me a story about a bear crashing through the living room, so we've decided to promote a more permanent structure.) The spin is that we’d have a CO-OP rental village made up of ECO friendly- family orientated - adventure housing, and operate as a day farm for persons with special needs. We would share our lifestyle, because we know first hand how lonely the world really is when you have a person with special needs to care for. We could help a diverse crowd by providing them with a unique yet rewarding living adventure.<br/><br/>I have spoken with our pediatrician and my own physician about this idea. They think it's a great plan and very much needed here. I was told they would ""refer"" to us. <br/><br/><strong>WHAT WE WOULD DO WITH YOUR DONATION</strong><br/><br/>We do require a land purchase or a donation of land. We would need to build the cabins. We would need to build a barn, commercial grade kitchen, workshop(s), and garage. We would need to purchase enough fencing material for a secure perimeter fence.  <br/><br/><strong>WHAT LIFE WOULD LOOK LIKE ON THE FARM</strong><br/><br/>Imagine horse back riding, hiking mountains and walking trails, ATVing, tinkering with cars, wood working, stamping leather, gardening, cooking &amp; baking, reading a book near the pond. Plus, having access to pottery &amp; art lessons, singing &amp; music inspirations, athletics, bonfires, picnics and way more! <br/><br/><strong>WHAT YOU WILL RECEIVE</strong></p><p>*A quarterly newsletter, once we are up and running.<br/>*A t-shirt, a pen, a tour of the facility.<br/>*Your name on a recognition wall on site, if you wish.<br/>*Satisfaction of knowing that you have made a huge difference in the lives of others.<br/><br/>Please join  me to help other people live life to their fullest potential!  Thank you so very much. </p></div>","WHO WE AREHello, how are you?

<p>According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, a flare (or flare-up) is a sudden appearance or worsening of the symptoms of a disease or condition.  There are hundreds of symptoms across the multitude of chronic conditions.</p>
<p>For some of us, it may feel like we are constantly in a flare.  It can be hard to remember if we felt better or worse yesterday... two weeks ago... a month ago... two years ago.  One thing we can do with THELMA is figure out what our baseline, or ""normal"" is. Then, we can take a more active role in trying to heal if we know what things make us feel better or worse.</p>
<p>In building THELMA, we've been looking at ways to better identify the things that trigger flares for those of us with chronic conditions.  We are looking for ways to make it suck less to have a chronic condition.</p>
<p>We are not doctors. We are not medical professionals. We are people who, like you, have been profoundly affected by chronic conditions. We don't have the background to try to cure chronic conditions, but we do have the understanding and experience with data and technology to be able to find correlations and identify trends and triggers.</p>

<p>Because THELMA is such a relevant and compelling endeavor, we have been able to attract amazing talent who are contributing their time and resources.

<p>There is, of course, the risk that we will not achieve our funding goal. That would make us very sad because we really want to make the world a better place. And, we think the way we can do that is to bring THELMA into the world.</p>
<p>There is also the risk of dramatically exceeding our goal with the potential for significantly more active users during the phases than we have planned. If this happens, we will need to rapidly scale up staff and services. This would be a wonderful problem to have.</p>

<p><strong>What I am proposing:</strong></p>
<p>We are living in a new paradigm of heightened necessity to pay attention to mental and physical wellbeing.  We are ushering in another age of Aquarius, an opportunity for different structures that look at healing and wellness in a new way. My business focuses on using nature's elements with a primary focus on water to release, renew, rejuvenate both mind and body. The current state of mental and physical health in America is at a critical point, western approaches to mental health are failing or at best cannot keep up with the demand for services, and western medicine application of prescribing medications is not addressing the route cause of illness, our stress . Our central nervous system remains in a constant state of fight or flight and cortisol levels raised exhaust our adrenals leaving us susceptible to a host of various stress borne illnesses, anxiety, depression, obesity, auto immune diseases, heart disease and cancer to name a few plaguing our society. The goal of Artemis Water sanctuary is first, before doing anything is, to be, Drop out and drop in. To take ourselves out of mind chatter and body stress by engaging the parasympathetic nervous system or the rest and digest functions of the body. Hot and cold water contrast therapy is how. Welcome to the newest modality, a private water wellness circuit. I have created a space defined by the five elements, living moss walls, fire, stone, wood and water. </p>
<p> The wellness circuit offers you two hours either alone or with one other person, clothing optional, to float between a traditional dry sauna, a traditional Japanese Ofuro soaking tub (6 feet X 4 feet wide),  a cedar ice bath, a sitting rain shower and a radiant heat river rock bed (ganbanyoku). The object? Disconnect, do nothing, release to the water all that does not serve you, be renewed let the medium of water we were all born from and are mostly made of restore you. </p>
<p>At the  beginning or at the close of your private water wellness circuit be invited to have further healing through Thai bodywork, a movement therapy class and finally lay fireside and drink from the water bar of single sourced waters from around the world curated specifically for their health benefits, mineral content and life force. </p>
<p><strong>What is Contrast Therapy?</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627818896/bjh9sadv1pgticnkxst5.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>The Turks, Russians, Finns, Romans and Japanese have all used the idea of contrast therapy, transferring the body from very warm temperatures to very cold temperatures, as part of a regular health and wellness routine. The theory behind contrast therapy is simple—the heat from a hot sauna, soaking tub, or hot stone bed brings blood (and its nutrients) to the surface, which can soothe pain and ease sore muscles, then shocking the body in a cold plunge, which in most modern bathhouses remains at about 50 degrees Fahrenheit, increases circulation and pushes that nutrient-rich blood back into the body’s core. Contrast therapy works on the concept of vasodilatation (which occurs in the heat) and vasoconstriction (which occurs in the cold). This results in alternating the blood from flowing to the internal organs and extremities, which help reduce swelling, inflammation, enhance your sleep, improve circulation, relieve depression and provide an overall sense of wellbeing. There is also some exciting evidence coming out about the positive effects on the nervous system, contrast therapy reduces cortisol and resets the central nervous system, placing our over taxed fight and flight response back to the rest and digest mode to allow for immune system building and reduction of stress hormones in the brain not to mention better digestion tract function. </p>
<p><strong>How the circuit works</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1 :</strong></p>

<p><b>Reception the Five Elements and Water Bar </b></p>
<p>The space invites you in with expansive northern light exposure, the sound of a trickling brook, living moss walls, wood interiors, a live fireplace, an overstuffed rich emerald hued sofa, a movement space, and our single sourced water bar. </p>
<p>Check in and receive your bathrobe and instructions on how to best utilize your time for the contrast water therapy circuit. Enjoy the living moss walls, fire place and resting lounge with  a complimentary glass of Masaru Emoto water, while taking your first few breaths, allowing the elements of nature to begin to let your shoulders release. </p>

<p>What is a water bar? We are made up of 70% water, 80% when we are born and by the time we reach 70 it drops to around 60%, never the less we are mostly water this is the main point. Water is our life force, without it we cease to exist, with high quality water we increase this life force. This is called our chi (chee) the life force which sustains us. Water is not all treated equally, it has become a source of great study, the effect of water on the body depending on it's mineral and dissolved solids make up. Water from a glacier, and water from a mountain spring contain very different properties, different trace metals, minerals and acidity levels. We have taken water and what it can do for you to a scientific level at our water bar consulting with a water sommelier, yes a water sommelier,  we have curated a menu of waters from far and wide across the globe to address deficiencies and work optimally to increase your life force.</p>
<p> Dr. Masaru Emoto was one of the first individuals to conduct a scientific experiment on the power of positive words versus negative criticism or bullying words on glasses of water over time. He wrote a book and published these studies called, The Hidden Messages in Water. Dr. Emoto's study took bottles of water and taped pieces of paper with words of praise on some and words of criticism on others and taped the words facing the inside of the bottle. These bottles were frozen and the crystallization of the water in each of the bottles repeatedly formed beautiful symmetric crystals in the positive intention bottles and disorganized ""ugly"" crystals in the bottles written with criticism and mean words. The intentions we have and the words we use hold power to change how an individual looks and feels and Dr. Emoto's experiments are the physical manifestation of this. At the water bar we will offer complimentary Emoto water imbued with various intentions for each month, filled with reverse osmosis water, messages inscribed on the surface of the glass jars and amethyst crystals.</p>

<p>What is Thai bodywork? It's not a traditional massage but meridian energy work and physical manipulation of the body to create space and freedom of movement. It is a healing technique that was practiced before doctors. The manipulation involves deep massage and stretching and it happens on the floor on a firm mattress or a mat fully clothed. It is a therapeutic procedure that provides relaxation and restores healthy blood circulation. It also treats energy blockages, weak, dysfunctional organs, aches and pains, stress and tension, flexibility, paralysis, nerve problems and postural alignments. Thai bodywork differs from traditional massage by its use of body's energy line system, known as Sen lines. There is a basic theory that there are seventy-two thousand Sen lines that are also called energy lines that line the frame of the physical body. The sen lines corresponds with the Chinese acupuncture medications and the ancient medicine practice from Indian Ayurvedic. A session typically lasts an hour or maybe more and the massage works to stretch the entire body. The massage may include the pulling of toes, fingers and ears. Thai Massage is ideal for everyone as the sessions are customized for each individual with their body type and age.</p>

<p><strong>The Impact:</strong></p>
<p>Our world has shifted, the need for preventive immune system building and stress reduction is more necessary than ever before but our traditional methods  of gyms and  community spas are not always available to us in this new paradigm. We need to create new structures that offer support to mind and body to keep us healthy in these increasingly more stressful times. </p>
<p>This is one such structure, consider yourselves early adopters of  ancient modalities of healing in a new private and contactless environment. We are suffering, your contribution will bring the availability of these stress reducing, immune building modalities to Philadelphia even under a lock down. We are classified as ""personal services"" which is the same classification as a doctor's office, we can and will remain open. We service one person or 2 who live together at a time, exclusively.  </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>We all face complications that are unknown, building costs vary, availability and time lines for building are also factors for all who are creating new ventures in this time.  The opening date could be shifted by months not weeks, the cost of wood could climb again or the availability of plumbing components and as such the financial buffer to complete this project comfortably is how to ensure it gets done and this invaluable service can be offered. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I would like to offer a scholarship fund for teens suffering from the isolation of remote schooling who's mental health has been severely compromised at an age when developmentally they are emotionally more reactive,  we are seeing anxiety, depression and suicide rates soar. The traditional inpatient and outpatient mental health services are overwhelmed and wait times for beds are too long. This modality of healing bringing cortisol levels down provides a physical and emotional euphoria, it actually stimulates oxytocin and endorphins in the brain, the ""happy"" hormones.  Please see perks, to understand how you can contribute specifically to this fund. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","What I am proposing:
We are living in a new paradigm of heightened necessity to pay attention to mental and physical wellbeing.  We are ushering in another age of Aquarius, an opportunity for different structures that look at healing and wellness in a new way. My business focuses on using nature's elements with a primary focus on water to release, renew, rejuvenate both mind and body. The current state of mental and physical health in America is at a critical point, western approaches to mental health are failing or at best cannot keep up with the demand for services, and western medicine application of prescribing medications is not addressing the route cause of illness, our stress . Our central nervous system remains in a constant state of fight or flight and cortisol levels raised exhaust our adrenals leaving us susceptible to a host of various stress borne illnesses, anxiety, depression, obesity, auto immune diseases, heart disease and cancer to name a few plaguing our society. The goal of Artemis Water sanctuary is first, before doing anything is, to be, Drop out and drop in. To take ourselves out of mind chatter and body stress by engaging the parasympathetic nervous system or the rest and digest functions of the body. Hot and cold water contrast therapy is how. Welcome to the newest modality, a private water wellness circuit. I have created a space defined by the five elements, living moss walls, fire, stone, wood and water. 
 The wellness circuit offers you two hours either alone or with one other person, clothing optional, to float between a traditional dry sauna, a traditional Japanese Ofuro soaking tub (6 feet X 4 feet wide),  a cedar ice bath, a sitting rain shower and a radiant heat river rock bed (ganbanyoku). The object? Disconnect, do nothing, release to the water all that does not serve you, be renewed let the medium of water we were all born from and are mostly made of restore you. 
At the  beginning or at the close of your private water wellness circuit be invited to have further healing through Thai bodywork, a movement therapy class and finally lay fireside and drink from the water bar of single sourced waters from around the world curated specifically for their health benefits, mineral content and life force. 
What is Contrast Therapy?

The Turks, Russians, Finns, Romans and Japanese have all used the idea of contrast therapy, transferring the body from very warm temperatures to very cold temperatures, as part of a regular health and wellness routine. The theory behind contrast therapy is simple—the heat from a hot sauna, soaking tub, or hot stone bed brings blood (and its nutrients) to the surface, which can soothe pain and ease sore muscles, then shocking the body in a cold plunge, which in most modern bathhouses remains at about 50 degrees Fahrenheit, increases circulation and pushes that nutrient-rich blood back into the body’s core. Contrast therapy works on the concept of vasodilatation (which occurs in the heat) and vasoconstriction (which occurs in the cold). This results in alternating the blood from flowing to the internal organs and extremities, which help reduce swelling, inflammation, enhance your sleep, improve circulation, relieve depression and provide an overall sense of wellbeing. There is also some exciting evidence coming out about the positive effects on the nervous system, contrast therapy reduces cortisol and resets the central nervous system, placing our over taxed fight and flight response back to the rest and digest mode to allow for immune system building and reduction of stress hormones in the brain not to mention better digestion tract function. 
How the circuit works
Step 1 :

Reception the Five Elements and Water Bar 
The space invites you in with expansive northern light exposure, the sound of a trickling brook, living moss walls, wood interiors, a live fireplace, an overstuffed rich emerald hued sofa, a movement space, and our single sourced water bar. 
Check in and receive your bathrobe and instructions on how to best utilize your time for the contrast water therapy circuit. Enjoy the living moss walls, fire place and resting lounge with  a complimentary glass of Masaru Emoto water, while taking your first few breaths, allowing the elements of nature to begin to let your shoulders release. 
Water Bar

What is a water bar? We are made up of 70% water, 80% when we are born and by the time we reach 70 it drops to around 60%, never the less we are mostly water this is the main point.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Our new product launch is the<strong> Fire</strong> Eye Mud Eyeshadow Palette,  this palette is part of an Elements Collection, in which we have created five palettes: Fire, Water, Wood, Earth and Metal, which are considered as the 5 elements of life. Each will consist of rich pigmented colours that represent that element, however still subtle enough for an everyday use if required.  </p>
<p>The silky texture is enriched with plant based ingredients such as lemon balm, lavender and jojoba oil which helps the pigments glide smoothly on to the skin. </p>
<p>Our dream for this palette was to create something everyone can use and by incorporating the 5 elements of life into makeup, it brings about the idea of importance around looking after our environment by using less toxins and bringing balance to peoples lives by being aware of what they are using on there skin, as the 5 elements represent the key to crafting a healthy happy home and environment. </p>

<h3>About us</h3>
<p>Here at MUDD Beauty we are passionate about healthy living and makeup so we combined the two to create highly pigmented makeup derived from natural ingredients. </p>
<p>The Founder of the brand is Alixzondra Samuda, the culmination of her healthy lifestyle and sensitive skin, prompted her to investigate natural beauty products which would not only be beneficial for her skin but also consisted of high quality pigments to show forth on her skin of colour. Through researching the industry, she found even more reasons to make the switch, reasons being 60% of what you put on your skin can be absorbed into the bloodstream including any toxins in those products. </p>
<p>Whilst trying to find makeup to suit her skin tone she became aware of another gap in the market, high pigmented make up with natural ingredients for women of colour. These types of skin tones require high pigments to avoid the makeup looking ashy especially around the mouth area, as this area in women of colour is typically darker than the rest of the skin. </p>
<p>Alixzondra followed her instinct to make ‘MUDD Beauty’ a reality first launching a range of high pigmented liquid lipsticks made from natural ingredients with no toxic chemicals.  </p>
<p>The unique name descends from mud being a biological substance extracted from the earth thus representing the brand’s organic and earthy approach. Whats even better about these types of products is they are not only good for you but they are Eco friendly too.</p>

<h3>Our Brand Values </h3>
<p>Vegan – we ensure our products are vegan friendly by using plant based natural oils and minerals from the earth. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Mohamed Salleh or known as Sam Salleh. I was born and raised in Singapore. I've been born physically challenged, suffering from <i>Osteogenesis Imperfecta</i>. Currently, I'm self-employed doing direct selling of gift items and blogging.</p>
<p>I frequently travel to the Philippines because it is a nice place with less stress compared to Singapore. Apart from that, my big brother is married to a Filipino, so there always a sense of a second home when I am in the Philippines.</p>
<p>I remembered the first time I travelled to the Philippines, many of my friends, including the locals of the Philippines, advised me not to drink water from the tap because I might suffer from diarrhoea as the water may be contaminated even after it was treated. Therefore the advice is to boil the water or buy bottled drinks.</p>
<p>During my holidays in the Philippines, I can see lots of stocks and supplies of water in the supermarket. For me personally, I can afford to buy bottled drinks from the supermarket but for many locals it is a luxury to buy one.</p>
<p>I talked to my local Filipino friends who told me that even when there are existing water refilling stations, the vendors tend to take advantage by overcharging. Hence the idea for this water project is born.</p>
<p>The funds that I receive will be used to finance the first year of operation of the water station. This includes the purchase of the water purification system and bottles, rental of facility to house the system, renovation, application of business permit, website setup, and ongoing operating expenses such as workers’ salary, utilities, communication and other miscellaneous expenses.</p>
<p><i><strong>Locals will benefit from clean water that is affordable and ethically charged and also from the jobs that are created.</strong></i></p>

<p><strong>How will The Dalisay Water Station Project make a difference?</strong></p>
<p>The water system that we are choosing is a Reverse Osmosis (RO) Water Purification System. I choose this technology because of the superior water quality it delivers. Here are the major characteristics of RO water:</p>
<ul>
<li>100% Pure Water</li>
<li>100% Free of metals and other mineral ions and deposits</li>
<li>100% Free of chlorides and fluorides</li>
<li>100% Free of germs</li>
<li>Balanced neutral pH</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the water is of a very high quality and will benefit the large population in Mindanao. Here is a list of figures to help you understand about the population trends in Mindanao:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average population growth rate 2.89% (Source: <a href=""http://psa.gov.ph"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://psa.gov.ph</a>)</li>
<li>Mindanao population constitutes a quarter of Philippines’ total population (in 2010, Philippines had a population of 92 million)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s my production plan for the Mindanao community at the beginning stage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Around 1050 bottles per year (i.e. around 35 bottles per month)</li>
<li>Each bottle with a capacity of 15L.</li>
<li>Total yearly capacity is 6300L. (about monthly capacity 525L)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><i>With a huge population to serve, many locals will potentially benefit from this pure water station project that provides affordable, ethically charged water and also from the jobs that are created.</i></strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong><i>Natural Disasters</i></strong> – The Philippines has typhoons. Setting up in Mindanao has less risk of tropical storms because of the surrounding mountains.</p>
<p><strong><i>Security Risk</i></strong> – A water system is expensive. Security measures such as security cameras will need to be installed to prevent theft. I am also going to choose a location with low crime rate.</p>
<p><strong><i>Quality Maintenance</i></strong> – Some existing water stations businesses do not maintain their filters, and thus water quality dropped. Having adequate funds will ensure the water system is always maintained to continuously produce good drinking water. Bottles for packaging the water currently available are low quality products which may affect the purity of the water. Therefore to source for high quality bottles is a challenge as it may be very costly and in order to overcome that challenge I can buy the bottles cheaper through wholesale purchase.</p>
<p><i><strong>Competition</strong></i> – There are other existing vendors who also provide pure drinking water.  However, some conduct their business by overcharging. I am confident I have the ability to tackle this challenge by providing quality and affordability to be attractive to customers.</p>
<p><strong><i>Personal Challenge</i></strong> - I'm from Singapore and this project will be carried out in the Philippines. It will be tedious, time consuming and expensive for me to travel to Philippines on regular basis. Therefore I have plans to apply long term visa to stay in Philippines so that I could manage it during my stay.</p>

People in the affected areas are exposed to extreme amounts of smoke, ash, and debris in the air, so keeping the airways clean is more important now than ever!</p><p>Nasopure can help to wash the nasal passages, remove irritants, reduce swelling, and thin secretions which increases the efficiency of the nose hairs tasked with capturing irritants before they can further enter the body.

They need it now more than ever after being forced to breathe in all the smoke, ash, debris, and pollutants in the air caused by these fires. We want to send FREE Nasopure to those who need it most right now, and we need your help!Soon after these wildfires began, BeWell Health sent thousands of Nasopure samples to the victims in need throughout the affected areas. We are a small company though and cannot afford to do this all on our own, as the demand for more product is too great. We need your help so that we can send Nasopure kits to the victims affected by these wildfires. We appreciate any and all help!100% of the proceeds will go towards sending free Nasopure to the victims in areas affected by these wildfires! The proceeds will just cover our costs, we are not going to make any profit from this campaign. Our ultimate goal is to help a million noses breathe easier across the United States! If we do not reach our full goal, we will still put 100% of the proceeds towards sending free Nasopure to those affected by the wildfires. We will be working with Salvation Army Community Centers along with other organizations in the affected regions to get Nasopure into the hands of those who need it most. Your contribution will make a significant difference in the quality of life for the victims of these wildfires. We are on a mission to clear the air, one nose at a time - and we need your help!Wildfire disaster victims have been through many hardships in the past months and continue to face challenges, especially when it comes to the long-term health problems these disasters can cause. In California, Oregon, Arizona, Colorado and other states the recent fires have added tons of ash and smoke into the atmosphere, leading to record-breaking air pollution throughout the country. Short-term exposure can result in irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat, and cause chest tightness, coughs, and asthma flare-ups.  The nose filters 10,000 liters of air each day and during these historical droughts and fire seasons, our nostrils are under enormous stress. Further exposure to irritants causes swelling of the nasal membranes and impedes normal nasal drainage. People in the affected areas are exposed to extreme amounts of smoke, ash, and debris in the air, so keeping the airways clean is more important now than ever!Nasopure can help to wash the nasal passages, remove irritants, reduce swelling, and thin secretions which increases the efficiency of the nose hairs tasked with capturing irritants before they can further enter the body. Nasal washing is crucial for those living in areas affected by the wildfires. BeWell Health's mission is ""First Do No Harm"" and our products are made in the USA, assembled by adults with disabilities, and BPA Free. We strive to always do the right thing, provide high-quality products, give back to the community, and take care of the environment. Right now, the people affected by these wildfires across the United States need our help! Testimonials ""The Nasopure products that we received after the recent fires has helped beyond belief!

<h3>This is a calling for your Help and Support! </h3>
<p><u>Target #1 for this campaign is 400,000$ </u></p>
<p>And its not often I come out with such inquiry.  Because I am truly loving to find my own ways. But this time its not about me. Its about everyone. I am collecting funds to buy land where I can plant and grow rich, healthy and potent Tabernanthe Iboga.</p>
<p><i>My name is Aliya Galim</i>, I am originally from Kazakhstan. Have lived in different countries and experienced variety of amazing changes and growth. From corporate world, into Yoga practice and teaching, into Somatic Energy therapy, I have finally arrived to work with Nature. Today I am Intuitive Herbalist, Plant and Animals communicator.</p>
<p>Currently I live in Costa Rica with my partner, where every day I dig my hands into dirt-soil and grow powerful herbs and plants that I gather to create potions and medicine for people around me. I have never ever imagined that herbalism will be my thing. You see, I have never studied this, neither read any book or attended a course. It happened to me almost over a night. A night when I experienced the wonder gift of Iboga. This medicine plant literally reopened my ancient abilities and now I am in service to give back. To Iboga and to Humanity.</p>
<p><strong>Let me introduce you to this Magic Medicine Shrub.</strong><br/>Iboga Tabernanthe is a plant growing in Africa (Cameroon and Gabon),  it has been used by native African tribes of Bwiti religion for medicinal purpose, but mainly for spiritual transformation. Iboga root bark contains 30 known and many other unknown alkaloids. From those there are 4 main psychoactive alkaloids (Ibogaine, Ibogaline, Ibogamine, and Tabernanthine). These  impact receptors in the human brain and the network of nervous system. </p>
<p><strong>What is Addiction?</strong></p>
<p>Through my therapy individual work with clients I learned that what our understanding of  ""addiction"" is quite limited. We mainly associate it with obvious substance addiction. And for me this is only a tip of an ice berg. There is unseen, undercover quiet journey that this illness takes, before it surfaces as final drug or alcohol addiction.</p>
<p>So what is addiction? It is a strong or old dependency with which human associate own identity and without which human cannot face life. One can be dependent on:</p>
<ul>
<li>relationship and social belonging</li>
<li>technology, social media, shopping and hoarding</li>
<li>emotional, self-sabotage turbulence</li>
<li>mental repetitive patterns</li>
<li>need to be valued and seen by others</li>
<li>physical dependency like food, over-exercising, self-beauty image, even coffee</li>
<li>sexual need, promiscuities</li>
<li>violent communication and physical abuse</li>
<li>and finally - drug, alcohol, smoking</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words if a human believes that he or she cannot cope by own self and needs this or that, regularly or sometimes.... this is an addiction. And if substance addiction is obvious, loud and clear. The other above mentioned are very subtle and most of the time are not even recognized. I even realized that most of people who have severe illness unconsciously befriend their diagnosis and really depend on it, because it makes life busy and in a weird way meaningful. </p>
<p>I personally believe that every human being will benefit from one-time Iboga treatment in order to prevent consequences that are hard to reverse in future. </p>
<h3><strong>How does Iboga Tabernanthe help:</strong></h3>
<p>Today there is not enough of study of how Iboga works. Perhaps we don't have such technologies and fundings yet. But the alkaloids of Iboga relax and reset main biocomputer (brain) and the network of nervous system. As a chain reaction it follow to organs and systems. You can't predict what exactly will be healed in human. And those who I personally know have healed from very different symptoms. From physical, to mental and emotional. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>My Iboga Experience.</strong></h3>
<p><br/>During my one session I had restored connection with Mother Nature and my role in serving Her. I have been given straight-forward message that I have old memory of connection with Iboga Tabernanthe trees. And in this lifetime I am to restore this plant. Because beyond the leaves, fruits, bark and seeds there is a Massive Forceful Channel that brings Light and Peace. I have been given back my skills to communicate, feel and listen to the plants. Grow them into powerful resource. Since then every day I walk in the greenhouse, study plants from plants, bring home what was chosen and create an extract, decoction or elixir. How does it work? My logic mind still can't explain. But neither I have the need to explain it to myself. I simply follow the lead of the plants and it works. Before I believed I need to study names and purposes of herbs, attend a course where they will show me exact steps of how to do it. Came out I was so naive. The internal voice that guides me teaches me so much, that even modern books don't have such information. And this is all thanks to Iboga. This Medicine has gifted me with the ability to ""hear the plants and animals"". Which means that Iboga is not only for healing illness and addiction. It can help someone in a similar way it helped me: to open up individual abilities that this world needs.  You never know what will surface after Iboga treatment. I might label as a Profound Personal Spiritual Awakening and breaking free from doubts, fear and playing small.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>My Mission</h3>
<p>Tabernanthe Iboga is leading me to have own farmland where I can devote my heart and hands to plant Iboga seeds and grow them into powerful shrubs <i>in a completely new way. Not recommended by farmers or African tribes, not studied from books, but only through intuitive listening.</i></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Need</h3>
<p>Today I am supported and provided with basic necessities for my life. I have food and shelter. My financial state is enough for this, but not enough for reaching the target of Iboga Mission. I ""was told"" that people can help, and that I am not alone in this. I am able to grow it in a unique way for people and those who will resonate with this mission <u><i>will become the pillars of this project.</i></u></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Target &amp; costs</h3>
<p>This project is a big long-term plan which has sub-targets to meet. This particular fundraising is for purchasing the Land. I will be creating separate fundraising for each next step after previous one is almost or fully achieved. </p>
<p><strong>1 ) LAND</strong>: I am choosing New Zealand as the homeland for this farm. It is remoted and peaceful place that has perfect environment and climate conditions to grow Iboga. The condition and size of land that is needed costs from 300,000 to 1,000 000 USD. <u>So I am targeting 400,000$</u></p>
<p><strong>2) IBOGA</strong>: I will be travelling to Africa or another country to purchase seeds and transport them to the land by myself ~ <u>4000$</u></p>
<p><strong>3) TEAM</strong>: I will have to hire equipment and people to work and prepare the land. <u>Amount to be defined on the a later stage.</u></p>
<p><strong>4) BUILDING BARN:</strong> where Iboga can be treated and stored after harvesting. <u>Amount to be defined on the a later stage.</u></p>
<p><strong>POTENTIAL HOUSE FOR ME:</strong> in case the land that I purchase doesn't have any home to live in.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Support</h3>
<p>Financial support is the main way, and it can be any amount from 5$ and up. I am really grateful for every penny.</p>
<p>I also acknowledge that not everyone  have the financial means to support me, so here are other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please spread the word</li>
<li>Share this campaign on your social media, in your circle</li>
<li>If you are an influencer or community leader, just one repost and this can move mountains for me</li>
<li>Follow me on Instagram @earthtempleweaver and be sure to tag me when you share!</li>
<li>Spread spread spread! The more people are involved the sooner this can manifest!</li>

<p><strong>Ashley:</strong></p>
<p>""Several months ago, I found out my cousin was diagnosed with cancer and would be going into surgery. As I am a single parent and my boyfriend Rick was back in England caring for his father, there was no way for me to go and visit her. </p>
<p>At the same time, Rick's father was told he may have to go back into the hospital for a biopsy on his lung. Since I couldn't see either of them, I decided to go online and see if I could find a useful care package as I've had more than my fair share of surgeries and hospital stays where I just sat there miserable and sometimes alone. Losing track of time and self. Trying to wrap your gown around yourself so you aren't exposed or wishing you had better chap stick or a good toothbrush or just something to pass the time. </p>
<p>What I saw online shocked me. Nothing in the way of real useful care packages. There was a lot of cookies, teddy bears and get well balloons. While those are all sweet, it just wasn't fitting for what people really need.  I called several friends and family in disbelief that something like this didn't really exist. I found a few cancer specific ones with inspirational quotes on everything but nothing just for general self care in a hospital or at home sick or recovery.</p>
<p>I couldn't sleep. After this idea being stuck in my brain for days, I called Rick and asked if this is what I should be doing. It was my ""a ha"" moment. This was what I was meant to do. After reaching out to friends and family in the medical industry as well as people who have had long stays in hospitals, we took the next several months to source, test, and curate what we believe to be the essentials for anyone who is in this kind of situation.""</p>
<p><strong>Rick: </strong></p>
<p>""My Father fell ill when I was in another country, contracting pneumonia, 6000 miles away and there was nothing I could do, I was worried to say the least, I was visiting my girlfriend Ashley at the time and we came up with the idea of trying to find him a box of stuff to do and comfortable clothing to wear to make his stay easier.</p>
<p>To our surprise there was nothing online that resembled that at all, the closest being a pair of socks, that was it, you cant send them food because they're on a diet provided by the nurses, so what are you to do?</p>
<p>It was a while before I could fly back and see him, luckily my sister was there to help him and visit him.</p>

<p>Even after he had gotten out of the hospital and came home he was so exhausted and still in fear for his life that he was basically chair bound, getting up to use the bathroom left him breathless and I could see the defeat in his eyes, slowly accepting that he was falling apart and was going to die.</p>

<p><b><u>Human
Purpose</u></b></p>
<p>Bend Friend will assist
anyone who has a problem bending down, with a bad back, or has balance issues,
from baby boomers to the elderly. No more bending down to pick up food and
water bowls from the floor to fill several times a day. For many, what may seem
a simple task of feeding one’s pet each day, is not only difficult, but can be
dangerous for those struggling with balance and mobility challenges, back and
knee pain, arthritis and dizziness. Or, maybe it’s been a tough winter and your
back is sore from shoveling snow. Spring is here, the garden beds need to be
cleaned and flowers planted, but at the end of day, bending over just hurts too
much. Or, you’ve recently had a knee or hip replacement, or need one. This
product will create a sense of security against falls that can cause injuries
such as broken bones and for those living alone a fall can be life-threatening.</p>
<p><b><u>Pet Purpose</u></b></p>
<p>Our pets deserve the
highest quality of care. The importance of providing fresh food and water to
our pets daily cannot be overstated. Bacteria will grow in water or wet food
that sits for a few days leading to unintended neglect of our pet. In a survey
we conducted of pet owners, many admitted that they did not change water or
food daily, not because they didn’t care for their pet, but because it was
difficult and painful to bend or stoop down to retrieve the bowls. And, they
felt bad that their health was inadvertently affecting the health of their pet.
The health of our pets depends on clean water and fresh food daily. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b><u>Product Need</u></b></p>
<p>A
number of studies have found that people are now reporting physical problems
with balance, bending and kneeling at earlier ages than in the past. </p>
<p>In
an 11-year study of 18,000 people aged 50-64 conducted by the <u>National
Health Interview Survey</u>, it was reported that ""baby boomers are
increasingly reporting mobility-related problems, such as stooping, bending and
kneeling."" </p>
<p><u>The
National Center for Biotechnology</u> reports that an
estimated 19 million people experience some mobility difficulty. “The mean age
of those with minor, moderate, or major difficulty ranged from 59 to 67 years.
Of those reporting major difficulties, 32% said their problems began at age 50
years and younger.” </p>
<p>A
number of causes create these physical challenges.  “By far the most common causes were arthritis
and back problems, with patterns varying by age: arthritis was cited most by
persons who were at least 70 years old, while back problems were reported most
among those aged 18 to 49 years. Other common causes fell broadly into chronic
conditions associated with aging and accidental injuries.” </p>
<p>We
did our own research in many supermarkets and pet stores on both coasts of the
United States over the past year and spoke to hundreds of people. Wheelchair
bound pet owners, those with walkers, and others that seemed to have difficulty
moving or were seniors and boomers. 91.2% of respondents shopping in the pet
food aisles indicated that not only did they think it was a good idea, they
would buy Bend Friend or knew of someone with physical limitations who needed
such a product.</p>
<p>Bend
Friend is so vital that we are developing a proposal to introduce it to
government agencies because for those pet owners with mobility issues it is just
as important to their well being as wheelchairs, canes, and walkers.</p>
<p><b><u>Target
Demographic</u></b></p>
<p>Physically
challenged – Every year, more than 650,000 people need a total knee or hip
replacement, and an estimated 52.5 million U.S. adults report “that their
doctor told them they had arthritis” and of that “294,000 U.S. children under
the age of 18 (or 1 in 250 children) have been diagnosed with arthritis or another
rheumatologic condition.”  <i>(Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention)</i></p>
<p>Senior
citizens - The elderly population will more than double between 2010 and the
year 2050, reaching 80 million people <i>(2010 Census)</i></p>
<p>Baby
Boomers - The country is aging, as those born between 1946 and 1964 enter their
senior years it is predicted that 1 in 5 Americans will be elderly <i>(2010
Census)</i></p>
<p>Pet
Owners - According to the Humane Society (2012),
more than 164 million households in the United States own pets, an increase of
67 million in the last 30 years. This translates to more than 83 millions dogs
and more than 95 million cats living in 62% of all American households. Pet
owners spend more than $50 billion on their pets annually according to the
American Pet Products Association. </p>

that sits for a few days leading to unintended neglect of our pet. In a survey
we conducted of pet owners, many admitted that they did not change water or
food daily, not because they didn’t care for their pet, but because it was
difficult and painful to bend or stoop down to retrieve the bowls. And, they
felt bad that their health was inadvertently affecting the health of their pet.
The health of our pets depends on clean water and fresh food daily. 

Product Need
A
number of studies have found that people are now reporting physical problems
with balance, bending and kneeling at earlier ages than in the past. 
In
an 11-year study of 18,000 people aged 50-64 conducted by the National
Health Interview Survey, it was reported that ""baby boomers are
increasingly reporting mobility-related problems, such as stooping, bending and
kneeling."" 
The
National Center for Biotechnology reports that an
estimated 19 million people experience some mobility difficulty. “The mean age
of those with minor, moderate, or major difficulty ranged from 59 to 67 years.
Of those reporting major difficulties, 32% said their problems began at age 50
years and younger.” 
A
number of causes create these physical challenges.  “By far the most common causes were arthritis
and back problems, with patterns varying by age: arthritis was cited most by
persons who were at least 70 years old, while back problems were reported most
among those aged 18 to 49 years. Other common causes fell broadly into chronic
conditions associated with aging and accidental injuries.” 
We
did our own research in many supermarkets and pet stores on both coasts of the
United States over the past year and spoke to hundreds of people. Wheelchair
bound pet owners, those with walkers, and others that seemed to have difficulty
moving or were seniors and boomers. 91.2% of respondents shopping in the pet
food aisles indicated that not only did they think it was a good idea, they
would buy Bend Friend or knew of someone with physical limitations who needed
such a product.
Bend
Friend is so vital that we are developing a proposal to introduce it to
government agencies because for those pet owners with mobility issues it is just
as important to their well being as wheelchairs, canes, and walkers.
Target
Demographic
Physically
challenged – Every year, more than 650,000 people need a total knee or hip
replacement, and an estimated 52.5 million U.S. adults report “that their
doctor told them they had arthritis” and of that “294,000 U.S. children under
the age of 18 (or 1 in 250 children) have been diagnosed with arthritis or another
rheumatologic condition.”  (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention)
Senior
citizens - The elderly population will more than double between 2010 and the
year 2050, reaching 80 million people (2010 Census)
Baby
Boomers - The country is aging, as those born between 1946 and 1964 enter their
senior years it is predicted that 1 in 5 Americans will be elderly (2010
Census)
Pet
Owners - According to the Humane Society (2012),
more than 164 million households in the United States own pets, an increase of
67 million in the last 30 years. This translates to more than 83 millions dogs
and more than 95 million cats living in 62% of all American households. Pet
owners spend more than $50 billion on their pets annually according to the
American Pet Products Association. 
                                                                 Bend-Friend:
                                                    The Only Product of its Kind

Use of Funds
Completing Prototype Development
The prototyping process
will produce a functional full scale model of the product. The prototype will
be evaluated for proper fitment of components, mechanism functionality, human
factors/user friendly experience, and overall form. 


I
am sure many of you, or have a family member or friend, who has bending and
kneeling problems and something as simple as dealing with feeding your pet has
become a not-so-easy task. We are committed to getting this product on the
market as soon as possible, and are so close…we just need the funding to
complete the last steps. This is such an important product for people with
physical challenges…people of all ages…and as important as a wheelchair, cane
or walker.
We
owe our pet fresh water and food EVERYDAY. Let’s face it…some days we just
can’t bend down several times a day without pain. This leaves our pet with no
water, bacteria-laden water or dried up food.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are working closely with the Homeless Veterans Rehabilitation Program in Menlo Park and the General Medicine Clinic of the Palo Alto Veterans Hospital. Our goal is to raise funds to provide Organic Holistic Treatments for Healing at HVRP to Volunteers in that Program.</p>
<p>Ken Kesey went to the Veterans Mental Facility in Menlo Park Ca. Born in La Junta, Colorado, Ken Kesey earned his journalism degree from the University of Oregon in 1957 and then studied creative writing at Stanford in the late '50s. While at Stanford he tried hallucinogens for the first time after volunteering for a government research program at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Menlo Park. As part of the program, Kesey was given LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, and AMT. During this same period of his life, Kesey worked as a psychiatric attendant at the hospital, which provided inspiration for his first novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. While at Stanford, Kesey lived at Perry Lane, a bohemian community in Palo Alto. He became known for throwing parties where psychoactive chemicals often found their way into the punch bowl.<br/><br/>After Cuckoo's Nest was published, Kesey purchased property in La Honda, California, where he and the Merry Pranksters threw their infamous Acid Test parties during the mid-'60s. These events, fueled by diverse and intriguing guests, day-glo decorations in the trees, music from hidden speakers, and plenty of LSD, were well documented. In 1964, Kesey and the Pranksters set out on a cross-country bus trip to the East coast in a psychedelically painted school bus named Furthur. Along the way they met, among others, Allen Ginsberg, Timothy Leary, Ram Dass, and Jack Kerouac. The trip has been immortalized by Tom Wolfe's book The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, as well as in the recent documentary Magic Trip.<br/><br/>Ken Kesey stood as a transition between the Beat Generation of the '50s and the Hippies of the '60s.

<p>I moved to Mankato in 2015 from Nebraska. After teaching 7-12 sciences and coaching, I went to grad school with dreams of becoming a kinesiology professor and researching PNF stretching (arguably the most effective stretch type for improving flexibility) and delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS). However, after my first year of grad school, I suffered a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in a 2007 car accident. I learned how to apply exercise science from my education to my own healing and eventual power lifting training. I received an MSE in exercise science in 2010. I was led to Mankato Family YMCA in 2016, where I taught Simple Stretch, water aerobics, and Exercise Is Medicine to active older adults (AOA) and other special populations for 2.5 years. Through my own return to active living with TBI and healing the resulting injuries which resulted from inflexibility, and through helping people at the Y move with less pain by stretching more and better, I became known as someone who could adapt nearly any exercise for nearly any ability and someone who could help people stretch muscles they didn't know they have. When one of my ""snowbird"" water aerobics friends reported about a stretch studio she'd tried in California that charges high prices to stretch people in ways she'd experienced me stretching people out of kindness, she suggested I open my own stretch studio in Mankato. </p>
<p>I looked into that California business and opening a franchise here. Not only did it seem to be too cost-prohibitive, but their techniques don't align well with good stretch research. Theresa loves active living, learning, teaching, and helping others. So, while starting a nonprofit is too complicated for me, I do get to offer scientific research-based stretch services at reasonable prices, use a portable stretch table in order to reach people wherever in the Mankato area they are, and give 10% of my intake to the Upper Midwest chapter if the Multiple Sclerosis Society in order to help people with a degenerative disease that affects cognition and movement, among other life aspects.</p>
<p>I'm getting guidance from Mankato's Small Business Development Center. And, I've been blessed to have access to friends and resources who've helped me begin serving Mankato. I'm currently borrowing a friend's massage table, for which I just was able to order a replacement with December's income.</p>
<p>A significant deterrent to booking more stretches than I am now is my availability. I love that I have inexpensive access to an area church, but I've only gotten two hours each week. I cannot get people who are unavailable during those two hours. And, especially because a new client must complete a health history-waiver before I can begin a stretch, about 15 minutes are added to either a 15- or 30-minute stretch, limiting the number of people I can stretch in two hours to 2-4. So, I'd LOVE to lease a tiny office space. I don't have enough consistent clients yet to pay a lease or utilities, or purchase a few inexpensive seats and a desk.</p>
<p>Besides needing more availability in order to attract clients, one of my greatest needs is multimedia marketing. My target audience in the first several years is retirees. Many use social media, like Facebook. So, Flexibility4All has a Facebook page, along with a free website, a YouTube presence, and a Twitter account. The marketing on Facebook us reasonably-priced. But, many older adults use the local paper and read regional magazines. Ads in those-even small ads-can cost hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p>While I hold a Master's of Science Education in exercise science, am currently certified in American Council on Exercise Group Fitness Instruction (ACE GFI), am American College of Sports Medicine Exercise Is Medicine-certified (ACSM-EIM), and am experienced in both group and personal training, I believe the online training to essentially ""trade in"" my GFI for an ACSM Exercise Physiologist (ACSM-EP) certification will better-assist me as I work individually with persons in a therapeutic capacity and its relevant continuing education over time will keep me more current on the science of flexibility exercise in helping others. The exam for members (which I am already) is $279. The book required for ACSM-EP's is ACSM's Resources for the Exercise Physiologist, 2nd Edition (ISBN: 978-1-4963-3907-2). Purchase of the paperback book and the online exam study program I'll need (because I received my degree over eight years ago and have memory trouble related to my TBI) is $127.97.</p>
<p>Since I've encountered nearly no one who's familiar with the concept of assisted stretch, I'd like to advertise my services in multiple media types where people of all ages are likely to read them. I've already designed a Facebook business page, so I can purchase Facebook services to share my page and significant page postings to people within several miles of Mankato for $20 or more. There are multiple paper, radio, and television advertisement resources in and around Mankato which I can utilize, but their prices run over $100, often.

</div></div>","I moved to Mankato in 2015 from Nebraska. After teaching 7-12 sciences and coaching, I went to grad school with dreams of becoming a kinesiology professor and researching PNF stretching (arguably the most effective stretch type for improving flexibility) and delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS). However, after my first year of grad school, I suffered a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in a 2007 car accident. I learned how to apply exercise science from my education to my own healing and eventual power lifting training. I received an MSE in exercise science in 2010. I was led to Mankato Family YMCA in 2016, where I taught Simple Stretch, water aerobics, and Exercise Is Medicine to active older adults (AOA) and other special populations for 2.5 years. Through my own return to active living with TBI and healing the resulting injuries which resulted from inflexibility, and through helping people at the Y move with less pain by stretching more and better, I became known as someone who could adapt nearly any exercise for nearly any ability and someone who could help people stretch muscles they didn't know they have. When one of my ""snowbird"" water aerobics friends reported about a stretch studio she'd tried in California that charges high prices to stretch people in ways she'd experienced me stretching people out of kindness, she suggested I open my own stretch studio in Mankato. 
I looked into that California business and opening a franchise here. Not only did it seem to be too cost-prohibitive, but their techniques don't align well with good stretch research. Theresa loves active living, learning, teaching, and helping others. So, while starting a nonprofit is too complicated for me, I do get to offer scientific research-based stretch services at reasonable prices, use a portable stretch table in order to reach people wherever in the Mankato area they are, and give 10% of my intake to the Upper Midwest chapter if the Multiple Sclerosis Society in order to help people with a degenerative disease that affects cognition and movement, among other life aspects.
I'm getting guidance from Mankato's Small Business Development Center. And, I've been blessed to have access to friends and resources who've helped me begin serving Mankato. I'm currently borrowing a friend's massage table, for which I just was able to order a replacement with December's income.
A significant deterrent to booking more stretches than I am now is my availability. I love that I have inexpensive access to an area church, but I've only gotten two hours each week. I cannot get people who are unavailable during those two hours. And, especially because a new client must complete a health history-waiver before I can begin a stretch, about 15 minutes are added to either a 15- or 30-minute stretch, limiting the number of people I can stretch in two hours to 2-4. So, I'd LOVE to lease a tiny office space. I don't have enough consistent clients yet to pay a lease or utilities, or purchase a few inexpensive seats and a desk.
Besides needing more availability in order to attract clients, one of my greatest needs is multimedia marketing. My target audience in the first several years is retirees. Many use social media, like Facebook. So, Flexibility4All has a Facebook page, along with a free website, a YouTube presence, and a Twitter account. The marketing on Facebook us reasonably-priced. But, many older adults use the local paper and read regional magazines. Ads in those-even small ads-can cost hundreds of dollars.
While I hold a Master's of Science Education in exercise science, am currently certified in American Council on Exercise Group Fitness Instruction (ACE GFI), am American College of Sports Medicine Exercise Is Medicine-certified (ACSM-EIM), and am experienced in both group and personal training, I believe the online training to essentially ""trade in"" my GFI for an ACSM Exercise Physiologist (ACSM-EP) certification will better-assist me as I work individually with persons in a therapeutic capacity and its relevant continuing education over time will keep me more current on the science of flexibility exercise in helping others. The exam for members (which I am already) is $279. The book required for ACSM-EP's is ACSM's Resources for the Exercise Physiologist, 2nd Edition (ISBN: 978-1-4963-3907-2). Purchase of the paperback book and the online exam study program I'll need (because I received my degree over eight years ago and have memory trouble related to my TBI) is $127.97.
Since I've encountered nearly no one who's familiar with the concept of assisted stretch, I'd like to advertise my services in multiple media types where people of all ages are likely to read them. I've already designed a Facebook business page, so I can purchase Facebook services to share my page and significant page postings to people within several miles of Mankato for $20 or more. There are multiple paper, radio, and television advertisement resources in and around Mankato which I can utilize, but their prices run over $100, often. Anything I can get to use toward advertising, continued education, and space lease would help. And, I ALWAYS appreciate help and use it to further help others.
 
I know what I'm doing. And, I've absorbed from my parents a tremendous value of customer service. So, I know once I begin getting customers, I'll KEEP customers and help lots of people.

<p>This fund is to connect displaced workers with new and sustainable earning opportunities.</p>
<p>My Mission.</p>
<p>In the last year, I’ve had a disturbing number of friends and family members lose their jobs for taking time off during an illness, often for jobs that did not provide affordable health care plans.  They worked for companies where the wages were low, the expectations were high, and the working conditions were negative.  They couldn’t save because they didn’t earn enough to live on, many of them that had a second job spent half the earnings just getting to it and now they have nothing to work with when they are trying to start over.</p>
<p>Unless you have a trust fund, sugar sponsor or are coming off a recent lottery win, staying out of work is no fun.  Even when you have help it may not be the kind of help you really need, someone paying a bill, giving you a ride to a job interview or letting you hold a few dollars works for now, but what does it do in the long-term when the people that are helping you are living check to check, just like you were before?  If you are one of those helpers, thank you.  You are amazing.  You made a choice to have a positive impact in someone’s life.  Maybe you’d be interested in something that can make a long-term impact with a short-term contribution.</p>
<p>There is a company called Arise Virtual Solutions.  It operates a virtual call center platform that connects potential workers with Fortune 500 and other companies to work as independent contractors.  Any one can apply to work with Arise.  No experience necessary.  They will train you and get you ready to start over through this new opportunity.  If you already have a job and want to make some additional money you can follow the link <a href=""http://www.ariseworkfromhome.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ariseworkfromhome.com/</a> and get started today.  For the displaced workers we’ve been talking about, there is a bit more to it.</p>
<p>Independent Contractors are responsible for providing their own services and equipment, so to get started working with the platform you’ll need, among other things, a home phone line, high speed internet, a USB headset, a corded home phone with headset and to start your own organization or business unless you are willing to work under another company on the platform.  The estimated start-up cost is between $250 and $770 depending on what services you already have, whether not you organize, incorporate or decide to do neither.  It can sound like a lot until you think about how much you spend helping someone that has been out of work for more than a month.  The bills keep stacking up and there is no return investment on disconnected services like lights, gas and internet, but there is in connecting to earning opportunities where the contractor makes the schedule, the expenses are deductible, transportation costs are reduced, and tax rates are lower. </p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns, please reach out to me and I will share all the information I have.  Let’s make a difference.</p>

INVEST IN HERVEST; INVEST IN COMMUNITY

Besides being environmentally-conscious, Hervest is a socially responsible company. We invest in women — our soap makers are all single mothers from local communities who are taught a livelihood skill by learning how to create homemade soap, and a variety of luxury personal care products. Our goals mainly are, to create employment opportunities for single mothers, and to empower them to achieve a healthy, independent and positive life. 
 

Risks & Challenges
Most of our key ingredients are produced in small factory with hand. And we need to get some of certification papers to export. 
So honestly our shipment may be delayed depend on situation.
In any case we will do my best to produce higher quality products as possible as we can.

<p align=""center""><strong>The Mental Health Party</strong><br/>Compassion, A Future we can all Believe in.<br/>in dedication of Hamish.</p>
<p><br/>Let me tell you a story,<br/>I am a postgraduate psychologist, with specialisations in health &amp; organisational psychology, with postgraduate qualifications. I entered university mature age, beforehand and during university I worked in nearly every industry imaginable. I also established and directed my own small business employing on average 8 people. Despite my experience and qualifications I have struggled to find decent employment within the mental health field for the last year, unable and unwilling to pay an extra $30,000.00 for placement, bound by bureaucracy and red tape from helping others who are in need.<br/><br/>A working with children’s card gives employers the ability to check criminal records and is necessary for nearly every application in the mental health field; work, education and volunteering. Mine recently expired, so the other day I traveled to Fremantle post office to renew it.<br/><br/>As I got out of the car I noticed a man sat nearby. I could see he needed someone to talk to. Over the next hour we spoke along side the road. He explained that his son died last week. He descried how he was suffering psychologically. Although he didn’t say the words, I assumed from what he said, his son had taken his own life. He told me countless stories of his son trying again and again, to acquire help. Increasing in desperation, continuously being turned away at mental health facilities he eventually resorted to lashing out as a last ditch attempt, a scream for help, to no avail.</p>
<p><br/>The man explained how it wasn’t over, how all the bureaucracy surrounding the event was only causing more hardship, both mental and financial. He too was now becoming desperate for help, and felt like he was beating his head against the wall trying to find any. This at a time where support means so much, is unfathomably beneficial and protective.<br/>He discussed his disappointment with the government. How over his lifetime he’s seen quality of life decline within Australia, and no clear positive direction for the future. I think all of us who have spent enough time in Australia would agree.<br/><br/>Like many of us this man struggled to understand why there is no option of government focused on the well being of the population. He said if only there was a Mental Health party that had people’s best interest at heart, he would vote for them.<br/><br/>We parted ways, and I hope that things have become easier for him since our conversation, but realistically I doubt they have. All he needed at that point was someone to listen to him. I continued to the post office.<br/><br/>With forms and id in hand including my recently expired working with children card I acquired when I was at university, I explained I would like to renew it. “where are you currently working” said the clerk. I am not working in a position that requires a working with children card right now. “It is required for my applications so I can attain a job within the field”. “oh I’m sorry we can’t help you then”. “so, your saying that even though I need this to be employable I cant renew it unless I already am already employed”.  Two of employees simultaneously looked at me, like blank automatons and in sync reply “yes”. It astounds me when people don’t question these things. Chicken and egg bureaucracy at its finest.<br/><br/>What a state we have got ourselves into. Through no fault of our own. The saddest and most frustrating thing is many like me, have the desire, skills and time to have helped that mans son and those like him, but are restrained from doing so. We have a government that values profit over compassion and control over empowerment and social mobility. For these reasons I’ve decided to try and make this man’s idea a reality. To create a political party and hopefully movement dedicated to the well being of the population, and in turn planet. By doing so we will eliminate so many of the problems negatively affecting society and encourage a positive outlook on the future. One that is currently missing and greatly needed.<br/> </p>
<p align=""center""><strong>The Plan</strong></p>
<p>The truth is we already know how to design a society that encourages the best in people and allows everyone to prosper. Debt and profit systems are incapable of doing this. These have continued to fail through recorded history. We can see this starting to happen in the world already. The people in charge are continuing the exact same financial tactics that caused the financial crash of 2008 and Australia is leading the charge in credit default swaps. Science and nature are our best teachers. The rat park experiment is a great example.<br/><br/>Ironically enough I began writing this before the most recent political fall out and the loss of another Australian figurehead. But the people we have in charge are neither teachers nor leaders. They are career politicians. Politicians who spend so much time bickering they do not have enough time to understand the world and who have given themselves that many pay rises at the expense of others they no longer live in nor understand the world of the people they are supposed to serve. In essence they have forgotten that leadership is a service, not a privilege.</p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>This is not something I necessarily want to do. I value my privacy. I will happily hand over the torch of leadership to anyone more suited and continue to offer my knowledge and guidance. But it is something I know I can do and together we can do it better. At present we do not have a true democracy. We have one that resembles a south park episode. One that is built on the illusion of choice. The two party system.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/>“We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them”</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">-<i>Einstein</i></p>
<p align=""center"">It’s time for a radically new approach to politics in Australia</p>
<p align=""center"">A time for new thinking.</p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>The Mental Health Party will aim at creating a true democracy, with compassion, sustainability and equal distribution of prosperity generated by new technology. The public is ill prepared for a fast approaching future that current politicians fail to acknowledge. We will work toward improving peoples work life balance without detriment to quality of life. We already understand and have the technology to do this. By strengthening the weakest among us we all prosper.<br/><br/>To determine whether this is something people want and to acquire the funds to bring it to fruition, I have decided to start a crowd-funding opportunity. This is a way of offering my service, ideas and expertise without forcing them on anyone.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Vote by Crowd Funding</strong><br/> </p>
<p>Think of this crowd funding as a vote. I guess I’ve been inspired by the likes of Burnie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I’ve set the funding to <strong>AU$126, 338.45</strong>.<br/> </p>
<p><i>Rational</i>: Nature is a true democracy, the old peddled belief was that herd animals look to their leader, usually the dominant male, when he moves the heard follows. How convenient.<br/>But this is false. Now we know that they have an equal vote. As soon as over half the heard look in a certain direction the herd will move that way.<br/><br/>At the time of writing this the Australian population is 24,772,247, 51% = 12,633,845. It is also important that all people have the ability to vote so I dropped a couple of decimals. A target of <strong>AU$126,338.45 </strong>means that <strong>if %51 of Australians donate 1 cent each this project will go ahead</strong>. This also means that you can vote for 100 Australians with $1. I see no reason, why this amount of money, with your help, spent wisely would not be enough to start a political party and possibly fund an election campaign.<br/><br/>It is worth noting how much liberal and labour spend trying to convince you to vote them into power. What a waste of money.</p>

Lobbyists who often have intentions and motivations, contrary to those that benefit society. Once a political party has been elected they are indebted to these lobbyists and encouraged to push through legislation that benefit the people that paid for them to win the election, not the people that voted for them in. How often do you hear politicians say one thing preceding the election and do the opposite once in power. The Obama campaign won prestigious advertising awards upon his election.</p>
<p>(<a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/Business/Politics/story?id=7947528&amp;page=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://abcnews.go.com/Business/Politics/story?id=7947528&amp;page=1</a>)<br/><br/>This is not a true democracy and we wont have one until this practice is ended. Crowd funding is one way to eliminate this. A party paid for by the people, is owned by the people.<br/><br/>Before opening your wallet, I know there are generous people out there that will want to give more than they can afford. Desperation for change can prompt people to invest heavily. But change rarely comes easy. Please don’t donate more than can afford to lose. Only give an amount you will not miss and that wont impact negatively on your life. If this fundraiser results in the establishment of The Mental Health Party as intended and gains funding from elsewhere, I will endeavor to refund any initial crowd-funding donation upon request.<br/><br/><strong>Initial Spending </strong><br/><i>Rational</i></p>
<p>The truth is, that to make this party a reality we don’t need money, we need reach, space, human capital, skills &amp; passion, and public will.<br/><br/>If this crowd funding is successful, I will treat the creation and direction of The Mental Health party as my only full time job and will draw a weekly wage of $330.00 because I don’t need more than that to survive. If the Mental Health Party is successfully established I will increase my wage to minimum wage, It will remain at that level unless I can justify raising it and it is agreed upon by the majority of members, that means you.<br/><br/>Human capital is the most valuable thing we possess as a society. It is unfortunate the current system does not value it as it should. That is why we have an increasing amount of homelessness in Australia and people with University degrees on work for the dole. A new term has emerged over the last decade “the working poor”. Describing those with jobs, sometimes full time jobs who still live below the poverty line. This is due to wage stagnation, lack of work and 50 years of siphoning increasing profits off to the top. The middle class is disappearing. A healthy middle class is one indication of effective government and a positive society.<br/><br/>Many people are generous. It’s usually the poorest among us, that give the most to others in need. I will welcome any input that people are willing to offer. However, your time is valuable. You are valuable. For this reason I will offer as many minimum wage positions/contracts as possible dependent on funding to achieve our initial objectives. I will explain why it is important that these positions are minimum wage in the next section. I will consider everyone for paid roles, and would prefer to be able to pay all volunteers, but priority will go to those who need it most. I will accept aligned help people are willing to offer, and will aim at making the most of the time you invest.<br/><br/>Reach is easy today with the Internet; you just need to hit the share button. Do that. However earlier generations that hold a large portion of the vote, use the Internet less and are often more rigid in their thinking. Word of mouth, taking time to understand and explain the The Mental Health party to the ones you love who do not have access to, or use the internet would be one of the most helpful and effective ways to counter this. Another way is to take the message to them. For this reason one of the main initial goals of The Mental Health party is to create a prime time advertisement to reach the above mentioned demographic and counter the mainstream political propaganda.<br/><br/>My idea for our commercial is also simple. You’ve seen them time and time again. Political adverts using actors pretending to be an assortment of real people, reading consecutive lines off a script, telling you how great a certain politician is. Ours will be the same, but it will be honest and all it will take is you, your webcam, a script and some editing. I’m just a little sick of seeing actors pretending to be tradies with brand new Hi Vis shirts and a left handed hammer.<br/><br/>Its no wonder political campaigns cost so much, they constantly interrupt your day. The prices for advertising are extortionate, and can well surpass $150,000.00 per 30 seconds. Yes you read correctly. For this reason the bulk of the crowd funding will probably go on airing the advert once, at the best time, on the most channels possible.<br/><a href=""https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/k-for-30-secs-you8217ve-got-to-be-kidding-the-most-expensive-tv-shows-for-advertisers-in-australia-revealed/news-story/dd39a4a74c83dfbcd1c020f1b9a1f2e8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/k-for-30-secs-you8217ve-got-to-be-kidding-the-most-expensive-tv-shows-for-advertisers-in-australia-revealed/news-story/dd39a4a74c83dfbcd1c020f1b9a1f2e8</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Initial Break Down/ Road Map </strong></p>
<p>In no particular order.</p>

Let me tell you a story,I am a postgraduate psychologist, with specialisations in health & organisational psychology, with postgraduate qualifications. I entered university mature age, beforehand and during university I worked in nearly every industry imaginable. I also established and directed my own small business employing on average 8 people. Despite my experience and qualifications I have struggled to find decent employment within the mental health field for the last year, unable and unwilling to pay an extra $30,000.00 for placement, bound by bureaucracy and red tape from helping others who are in need.A working with children’s card gives employers the ability to check criminal records and is necessary for nearly every application in the mental health field; work, education and volunteering. Mine recently expired, so the other day I traveled to Fremantle post office to renew it.As I got out of the car I noticed a man sat nearby. I could see he needed someone to talk to. Over the next hour we spoke along side the road. He explained that his son died last week. He descried how he was suffering psychologically. Although he didn’t say the words, I assumed from what he said, his son had taken his own life. He told me countless stories of his son trying again and again, to acquire help. Increasing in desperation, continuously being turned away at mental health facilities he eventually resorted to lashing out as a last ditch attempt, a scream for help, to no avail.
The man explained how it wasn’t over, how all the bureaucracy surrounding the event was only causing more hardship, both mental and financial. He too was now becoming desperate for help, and felt like he was beating his head against the wall trying to find any. This at a time where support means so much, is unfathomably beneficial and protective.He discussed his disappointment with the government. How over his lifetime he’s seen quality of life decline within Australia, and no clear positive direction for the future. I think all of us who have spent enough time in Australia would agree.Like many of us this man struggled to understand why there is no option of government focused on the well being of the population. He said if only there was a Mental Health party that had people’s best interest at heart, he would vote for them.We parted ways, and I hope that things have become easier for him since our conversation, but realistically I doubt they have. All he needed at that point was someone to listen to him. I continued to the post office.With forms and id in hand including my recently expired working with children card I acquired when I was at university, I explained I would like to renew it. “where are you currently working” said the clerk. I am not working in a position that requires a working with children card right now. “It is required for my applications so I can attain a job within the field”. “oh I’m sorry we can’t help you then”. “so, your saying that even though I need this to be employable I cant renew it unless I already am already employed”.  Two of employees simultaneously looked at me, like blank automatons and in sync reply “yes”. It astounds me when people don’t question these things. Chicken and egg bureaucracy at its finest.What a state we have got ourselves into. Through no fault of our own. The saddest and most frustrating thing is many like me, have the desire, skills and time to have helped that mans son and those like him, but are restrained from doing so. We have a government that values profit over compassion and control over empowerment and social mobility. For these reasons I’ve decided to try and make this man’s idea a reality. To create a political party and hopefully movement dedicated to the well being of the population, and in turn planet. By doing so we will eliminate so many of the problems negatively affecting society and encourage a positive outlook on the future. One that is currently missing and greatly needed. 
The Plan
The truth is we already know how to design a society that encourages the best in people and allows everyone to prosper. Debt and profit systems are incapable of doing this. These have continued to fail through recorded history. We can see this starting to happen in the world already. The people in charge are continuing the exact same financial tactics that caused the financial crash of 2008 and Australia is leading the charge in credit default swaps. Science and nature are our best teachers. The rat park experiment is a great example.Ironically enough I began writing this before the most recent political fall out and the loss of another Australian figurehead. But the people we have in charge are neither teachers nor leaders. They are career politicians. Politicians who spend so much time bickering they do not have enough time to understand the world and who have given themselves that many pay rises at the expense of others they no longer live in nor understand the world of the people they are supposed to serve. In essence they have forgotten that leadership is a service, not a privilege.
 
This is not something I necessarily want to do. I value my privacy. I will happily hand over the torch of leadership to anyone more suited and continue to offer my knowledge and guidance. But it is something I know I can do and together we can do it better. At present we do not have a true democracy. We have one that resembles a south park episode. One that is built on the illusion of choice. The two party system.
“We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them”
-Einstein
It’s time for a radically new approach to politics in Australia
A time for new thinking.
 
The Mental Health Party will aim at creating a true democracy, with compassion, sustainability and equal distribution of prosperity generated by new technology. The public is ill prepared for a fast approaching future that current politicians fail to acknowledge. We will work toward improving peoples work life balance without detriment to quality of life. We already understand and have the technology to do this. By strengthening the weakest among us we all prosper.To determine whether this is something people want and to acquire the funds to bring it to fruition, I have decided to start a crowd-funding opportunity. This is a way of offering my service, ideas and expertise without forcing them on anyone. 
Vote by Crowd Funding 
Think of this crowd funding as a vote. I guess I’ve been inspired by the likes of Burnie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. I’ve set the funding to AU$126, 338.45. 
Rational: Nature is a true democracy, the old peddled belief was that herd animals look to their leader, usually the dominant male, when he moves the heard follows. How convenient.But this is false. Now we know that they have an equal vote. As soon as over half the heard look in a certain direction the herd will move that way.At the time of writing this the Australian population is 24,772,247, 51% = 12,633,845. It is also important that all people have the ability to vote so I dropped a couple of decimals. A target of AU$126,338.45 means that if %51 of Australians donate 1 cent each this project will go ahead. This also means that you can vote for 100 Australians with $1. I see no reason, why this amount of money, with your help, spent wisely would not be enough to start a political party and possibly fund an election campaign.It is worth noting how much liberal and labour spend trying to convince you to vote them into power. What a waste of money.

(https://www.aec.gov.au/media/media-releases/201...)This money, the money used by mainstream parties to persuade the public comes from lobbyists. Lobbyists who often have intentions and motivations, contrary to those that benefit society. Once a political party has been elected they are indebted to these lobbyists and encouraged to push through legislation that benefit the people that paid for them to win the election, not the people that voted for them in. How often do you hear politicians say one thing preceding the election and do the opposite once in power. The Obama campaign won prestigious advertising awards upon his election.
(https://abcnews.go.com/Business/Politics/story?id=7947528&page=1)This is not a true democracy and we wont have one until this practice is ended. Crowd funding is one way to eliminate this. A party paid for by the people, is owned by the people.Before opening your wallet, I know there are generous people out there that will want to give more than they can afford. Desperation for change can prompt people to invest heavily. But change rarely comes easy. Please don’t donate more than can afford to lose. Only give an amount you will not miss and that wont impact negatively on your life. If this fundraiser results in the establishment of The Mental Health Party as intended and gains funding from elsewhere, I will endeavor to refund any initial crowd-funding donation upon request.Initial Spending Rational
The truth is, that to make this party a reality we don’t need money, we need reach, space, human capital, skills & passion, and public will.If this crowd funding is successful, I will treat the creation and direction of The Mental Health party as my only full time job and will draw a weekly wage of $330.00 because I don’t need more than that to survive. If the Mental Health Party is successfully established I will increase my wage to minimum wage, It will remain at that level unless I can justify raising it and it is agreed upon by the majority of members, that means you.Human capital is the most valuable thing we possess as a society. It is unfortunate the current system does not value it as it should. That is why we have an increasing amount of homelessness in Australia and people with University degrees on work for the dole. A new term has emerged over the last decade “the working poor”. Describing those with jobs, sometimes full time jobs who still live below the poverty line. This is due to wage stagnation, lack of work and 50 years of siphoning increasing profits off to the top. The middle class is disappearing. A healthy middle class is one indication of effective government and a positive society.Many people are generous. It’s usually the poorest among us, that give the most to others in need. I will welcome any input that people are willing to offer. However, your time is valuable. You are valuable. For this reason I will offer as many minimum wage positions/contracts as possible dependent on funding to achieve our initial objectives. I will explain why it is important that these positions are minimum wage in the next section. I will consider everyone for paid roles, and would prefer to be able to pay all volunteers, but priority will go to those who need it most. I will accept aligned help people are willing to offer, and will aim at making the most of the time you invest.Reach is easy today with the Internet; you just need to hit the share button. Do that. However earlier generations that hold a large portion of the vote, use the Internet less and are often more rigid in their thinking. Word of mouth, taking time to understand and explain the The Mental Health party to the ones you love who do not have access to, or use the internet would be one of the most helpful and effective ways to counter this. Another way is to take the message to them. For this reason one of the main initial goals of The Mental Health party is to create a prime time advertisement to reach the above mentioned demographic and counter the mainstream political propaganda.My idea for our commercial is also simple. You’ve seen them time and time again. Political adverts using actors pretending to be an assortment of real people, reading consecutive lines off a script, telling you how great a certain politician is. Ours will be the same, but it will be honest and all it will take is you, your webcam, a script and some editing. I’m just a little sick of seeing actors pretending to be tradies with brand new Hi Vis shirts and a left handed hammer.Its no wonder political campaigns cost so much, they constantly interrupt your day. The prices for advertising are extortionate, and can well surpass $150,000.00 per 30 seconds. Yes you read correctly. For this reason the bulk of the crowd funding will probably go on airing the advert once, at the best time, on the most channels possible.https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/k-for-30-secs-you8217ve-got-to-be-kidding-the-most-expensive-tv-shows-for-advertisers-in-australia-revealed/news-story/dd39a4a74c83dfbcd1c020f1b9a1f2e8

I think this will be effective, and the fact is that antacids, anti-diarrheals, ibuprofen, antifungal creams, etc. are low value to thieves.Customs: I feel somewhat confident in this area since I'm going to be among a hundred plus people who've done a very similar thing. I'm also receiving practical advice now from experienced medicine mules and I even have a few tricks up my sleeves from when my family lived in Egypt (like placing menstruation products on the top) that used to work great at getting us through.Transport: Ahmad Osman has volunteered to pick me up and get these items to the right people (as well as supporting me non-stop in planning for the last four days in spite of having just had surgery and being very busy--thank you!). He's already looking out for and preventing the dumb things that tourists like me can do coming out of an airport. Insufficient Prescriptions to Buy What's Needed: This is our biggest risk currently, but the management of it is not difficult in the sense that we can still buy more OTC items or work with our Medicins sans Frontieres pharmacist to find another channel.Ultimately, if some portion is stolen or confiscated, the sheer quantity we're bringing will more than offset it.Here's What You're BuyingThis is a rapidly-evolving list but will give you a sense of what I'm taking. For the more expensive prescription drug items, our budget gets us around 10 courses of treatment for most. The OTC items have been purchased much larger bulk quantities to maximize luggage space.●Ibuprofen syrup (pediatric) x10●Azithromycin (pediatric) x5●antiemitic (adult) Domperidone or US equiv x5●antiemitic (pediatric) Domperidone or US equiv x5●antibacterial Cefixime (pediatric) x10●antibacterial Cefixime (adults) x5●Augmentin/amoxicillin (pediatric) x10●Augmentin/amoxicillin (adults) x5●Voltaren or US equiv x10●Ciprofloxacin (adult) x10●Topical corticosteroid cream x10●Topical antibacterial cream x10●antifungal (adult) Daktarin or US equiv (monistat) x10●antifungal (pediatric) Daktarin or other oral gel/oral cream can be used in infants x10●Probitiotic for pediatric with diarrahea x10●Relvar inhalers x10 (2 so far)●Ramipril 10mg x10●Moxonidine or US equiv●Clopidogrel 75mg x10 (have 360ct so far)●Metronidazole syrup or US equiv x10●Acetaminophen/Ibuprofen combo pain reliever (4x bulk bottles)●Multivitamin male x10 (or equiv in bulk bottles)●Multivitamin female x10 (or equiv in bulk bottles)●Multivitamin generic (or equiv in bulk bottles)●Multivitamin pediatric x10 (or equiv in bulk)●Omeprazole 20mg (x10)●Acetaminophen otc x3 bulk bottles●cough drops (adult or ped) x4 bulk pouches●First aid kits●Band aids●Sleep aids●Vitamid C●adult probiotic●anti-diarrheal otc●melatonin 5mg●vitamin d3 50mg●fish oil supplements●menstruation products●anti-allergy adult●anti-allergy pediatric●batteries●nutrition bars●high-protein snack●small individually wrapped sweet for kids.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</font></font></font></font></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;"">Like any human enterprise, a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo is not without risks and challenges. The main risk is that the campaign would go unfunded and we would be stuck with the losses incurred for organizing the campaign. But this is mostly our problem.</font></font></p>
<p><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;"">As a backer, you are more interested of how our risks might impact you. The main risk for you as a backer is that your pledge would not be rewarded with the prize promised. We will make sure this would not happen under any circumstances.</font></font></p>
<p><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;"">We’ll explain how. But first, the risks:</font></font></p>
<p><strong><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;"">1. Manufacturing risks.</font></font></strong><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""> Production has its own risks that we might not control. Our suppliers might fail to produce on time, or at the quality expected, or they might go out of business.</font></font></p>
<p><strong><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;"">-&gt; Measures to mitigate: </font></font></strong><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;"">We have taken measures to prevent that. We work with established suppliers that have a goods background of success. We will invest some of our own resources before the campaign ends but after the campaign is fully funded, so that we make sure production is completed on time.</font></font></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;"">2. Product quality risks.</font></font></strong><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""> With every production, no matter the product or the company manufacturing it, there will be a small amount of damaged goods. This is something that can’t be avoided but just reduced in scale our product will be tested and retested for ph, shelf life and integrity.</font></font></p>
<p><strong><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;"">-&gt; Measures to mitigate: </font></font></font></font></strong><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;""><font style=""vertical-align: inherit;"">Once production is completed we arrange for quality check inspection. We are one of the fewest companies that arrange for full quality check of all products and not just a batch sample. We think that it’s more important to make sure every product is in the right shape before is delivered, even though that means a higher cost for us. We'll also replace any damaged product whatever the reason In the end, whatever happens, we will deliver the products, even if it means incurring a loss for us.</font></font></font></font></p>

Risks & Challenges
 
Like any human enterprise, a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo is not without risks and challenges. The main risk is that the campaign would go unfunded and we would be stuck with the losses incurred for organizing the campaign. But this is mostly our problem.
As a backer, you are more interested of how our risks might impact you. The main risk for you as a backer is that your pledge would not be rewarded with the prize promised. We will make sure this would not happen under any circumstances.
We’ll explain how. But first, the risks:
1. Manufacturing risks. Production has its own risks that we might not control. Our suppliers might fail to produce on time, or at the quality expected, or they might go out of business.
-> Measures to mitigate: We have taken measures to prevent that. We work with established suppliers that have a goods background of success. We will invest some of our own resources before the campaign ends but after the campaign is fully funded, so that we make sure production is completed on time.
 
2. Product quality risks. With every production, no matter the product or the company manufacturing it, there will be a small amount of damaged goods. This is something that can’t be avoided but just reduced in scale our product will be tested and retested for ph, shelf life and integrity.
-> Measures to mitigate: Once production is completed we arrange for quality check inspection. We are one of the fewest companies that arrange for full quality check of all products and not just a batch sample. We think that it’s more important to make sure every product is in the right shape before is delivered, even though that means a higher cost for us. We'll also replace any damaged product whatever the reason In the end, whatever happens, we will deliver the products, even if it means incurring a loss for us.
The only risk you are taking is that your reward might not reach you on time, but we'll do our best to avoid that. We will publish frequent updates on fulfillment status and you’ll always be up to date with the status.",32.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Hello! My name is Kyle Ogle and I am a Nurse Practitioner and product developer. My experience in healthcare expands over 10+ years and I have recently cared for patients with sleep apnea and snoring. The purpose of my product is treatment of position-dependent snoring and sleep apnea that provides a new level of comfort and convenience not currently available on the market.  The idea stemmed from over a year of treating and coaching patients regarding how to better manage their snoring and sleep apnea; I would often tell applicable patients to combine two body pillows as a solution because other methods currently available  were often not ideal for them (such as using tennis ball t-shirts). Snoring and sleep apnea are often worse when lying on the back. </p>
<p>This product is to ensure that the user maintains a side-lying position while sleeping throughout the night to minimize/eliminate snoring and to help treat sleep apnea. The concept is developed and a prototype has been created. The product is patented. </p>
<p>If not treated, sleep apnea can contribute to a number of health issues such as high blood pressure, stroke, heart failure, heart attack, and/or diabetes. This project is very important to me and my family as we have lost a loved one to stroke. It is my hope that introducing new methods of mitigating position-dependent snoring and/or sleep apnea risk will improve the lives of many. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<p>The funding for this product will be used to cover materials and manufacturing cost for the initial batch of units. If the goal is not met, excess funds will be reallocated to the American Stroke Foundation. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>By contributing to this project, you will help make an impact in the lives of many that may struggle with position-dependent sleep apnea and/or snoring. If left untreated, this has the potential to lead to or negatively affect many comorbid medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, and more. </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>There may be risks and obstacles faced with this project regarding the cost of initial manufacturing as well as final adjustments that may have to made to the product to optimally benefit users. With my experience in helping sleep apnea and/or patients that snore combined with assistance from this campaign, I am confident this product will reach its goal.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you cannot contribute, that is okay! Help get the word out and make some noise about this campaign that can benefit the health of many people with snoring and/or sleep apnea! Make sure to use the Indiegogo share tools. </p>
<p>No, some patients may have sleep apnea that is to severe to manage effectively with lateral positional therapy alone. Most patients have worse snoring while in the supine (back) position, so it could still help with this aspect in this specific population.</p>

<p>The inspiration for this project comes from a quote in a Kurt Vonnegut quote: “Theres only one rule I know of, babies… God damn it, you’ve got to be kind.”</p>
<p>A few years ago we printed vinyl stickers with the words “Be Kind.”, handed these out and asked people to stick them up in places around the city where you might not expect to see a positive message.</p>
<p>So..  we are hoping to expand upon that basic idea and see if we can bring this simple message to more people by funding a large billboard on a major highway leading into Johannesburg. In the same way where internet users often opt to pay money to have advertising removed from an app or service, we are asking you to contribute to this project so that we can reclaim one of the spaces traditionally used for advertising.  and transform it into a space that serves as a daily reminder to try to approach any person, act or situation with more kindness. </p>
<p>The funds will go directly into funding the printing, installation and one month rental of a large billboard. As perks we are also offering high quality T-shirts, Tote Bags and Posters and the funds will also be allocated to the manufacturing of these items.</p>
<p>Our hope is that if enough people see this daily reminder it may have a snowball effect and inspire more people to engage in acts of kindness however big or small. It is as simple as that.</p>

<h3><u>Hello + Welcome to the Buddha Bus Journey!</u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A Journey of Massage, Wellness, Community and Nurturing the Human Spirit. My name is Theresa Howell. I am a Licensed Massage Therapist and have been practicing Massage/Bodywork in Washington State for the past 10 years. I have a great passion and skill for connecting people to the healing power of the Mind+Body connection through Massage.  </p>
<p>I am here with the dream to bring Massage, Wellness, Connection, Education &amp; Awareness to your community (<i><strong>Tacoma, Olympia, Seattle, Puyallup, Gig Harbor, Portland, Boise + More</strong></i>!) by way of a <i>soon-to-be </i><strong>Renovated 36' Retired School Bus!</strong> I have purchased the bus and have it fully gutted with blueprint plans to create a beautiful, bohemian, eco-friendly, functional massage space where one can find healing through bodywork, workshops around wellness and self-care, monthly <strong>charity</strong> events benefiting<strong> YOUTH + VETERANS</strong> and more! </p>
<p>It is my goal and intention to raise <u><strong>$20,000 in just 32 days!</strong></u> We are turning to the YOU the community to help raise these funds because we are creating this for <strong>YOU</strong>, OUR COMMUNITY. The funds will be used specifically for the <strong>(1)</strong> the full renovation, <strong>(2)</strong> the merchandise rewards for each donation + shipping (check out the SWEET SWAG to the right) and <strong>(3) </strong>two kick-ass VIP PARTY'S once the renovations are done to celebrate its completion and show off all your donations+ our hard work that will be hosted in <strong>TACOMA, WA + BOISE, ID</strong> sometime in <strong>Spring 2019</strong>.  </p>
<p>This dream will become a reality with <strong>YOUR</strong> generous and kind support through <u><strong>Donations</strong> + </u><strong><u>Sharing</u> </strong>about our goals with your TRIBE of people! I am so excited to share with you the process of the renovation as well as the positive benefit The Buddha Bus will have on our community. Imagine... a space where all people can have access to the healing benefits of massage, a space where other wellness providers collaborate to offer charitable events benefiting those in need, workshops and retreats that connect us to ourselves, each other and nature in the great PNW! </p>
<h3><u>SO HERE'S WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET:</u></h3>
<p><strong>$20,000 </strong>will fully renovate this SCHOOL BUS and get it on the road to a neighborhood near you! Here's what <i>your donations</i> will achieve!!!</p>
<p><i>From insulation, frame work, plumbing (CAN'T WAIT TO USE THE COMPOST TOILET!), solar power panels, wood flooring, warm lighting, AC/Heat Unit, Paint, Awning, to a new set of back tires (they are a bit tired after 20 years of transporting a bunch of kiddos)... and so much more. Some of the work we will do ourselves for cost effectiveness (because there is a Youtube video on everything, am I right?).Things where we really need expertise skills on like electrical and servicing the vehicle, we will utilize people in our community and help $upport them in their trade to get the job done.</i></p>
<p><i>Here's the catch:<strong> If we DO NOT meet our goal of $20,000 within 32 days, all backers will be refunded by Indiegogo within 5-7 business days.</strong> In order to keep that from happening it is imperative that you <u>talk about this campaign and share it</u> with as many people as you can. Your family, friends, coworkers (ya, even that guy you never talk to that stares at you from the water cooler...) and encourage them to be apart of the journey too!  PLUS there is a fun <strong>PERK TO </strong><b>REFERRING</b>! For those who refer someone and that person donates at the $100 level or higher (your person must let us know you referred them) You will receive a <strong>70 HR Natural SOY SCENTED CANDLE Handcrafted by Me</strong>! </i></p>

<p>Alright, so how exciting for the PNW to have it's very own BUDDHA BUS roll'n into its neighborhoods... but what about the <strong>REST OF THE WORLD</strong>?! Aside from the <strong>SWEET SWAG</strong> you receive with your kind Donation, you can be proud to know that your donation will not just be benefiting those who receive massage and attend workshops or retreats within its happy, bohemian walls... I have spent a great deal over the last 10 years using <strong>donated massage</strong> to gift back to my community. As a proud wife to a Marine Veteran, I have a great passion and appetite to help <strong><u>VETERANS</u> </strong>who have served our country. What better way to give back to this great community of men and women who have sacrificed so much as well as those who struggle with PTSD from thier time serving, then through Massage and the Mind+Body connection.  The BUS will be accessible to this great community 1x a month at no charge for treatment sessions. Another great passion of mine and an area I see such a need is <u><strong>YOUTH</strong></u>. I am a blessed Mom to a tenacious 8 year old. They are often on the go as much as we are and with such an increased emphasis on technology and screen time, children and teens are often struggling themselves with anxiety, disconnection to their body and breathing, nature and just being still. <strong>Collaboration </strong>with several other professionals in the healing arts and health providers to create a monthly program where the BUS pulls into a school and utilizes the space to teach Mind+Body awareness to learn healthy ways to center and ground themselves and grow up with these tools is one of the most important things this BUS will do. With your donations, we can give back to our children and the community through this vessel!</p>

I am so humbled and grateful to be used in this way. The Buddha Bus has a magical energy that will reach into your soul and connect you to something adventurous, something so giving. KNOW that this will happen but with your donated support it will happen within a favorable time and a quality touch with YOU in mind at the forefront no matter the challenges that will arise. I am not afraid of challenges, hard work and problem solving.

<p>Even the most organised, conscientious person can have their day, week, or month unexpectedly derailed by mental illness.</p>
<p>The consequences can be minor; a missed appointment, an upset friend, unimpressed employer. But sometimes they are far worse. Think of a loving mother, who despite her best efforts, cannot leave the house to buy groceries to cook dinner. Maybe you just need to get a few small things done, but your anxiety has you stuck in a fog. It's frustrating, you know your illness won't have a hold on you forever, but right now, you are helpless.</p>
<p>That's where we come in.</p>
<p>My vision is to create an online network of volunteers, to help with any task, big or small, so that life doesn't fall apart. Think of it as a on call task service, provided by locals in your area.</p>
<p>The difference is the task can be something very simple, like feeding your dog who has been patiently waiting for you to feel better, help with finishing those references on your assignment that was due yesterday, picking up an item from the shops. Members can post a task on the angels job board, and a registered angel in their area, can accept. Angels are volunteers who share my passion for helping the community, and helping people with mental illness get on with their day.</p>
<p>No judgement, just support and understanding. </p>
<p>Where the task involves transportation or other costs, the member and the angel can agree upon a reasonable service  fee.</p>
<p>As a not for profit, Anxiety Angels aims to help all members of the community who need a helping hand, without wanting to announce that they are having a particularly bad day. </p>
<p>The goal is to take away the stress, guilt, and burden of the unintended consequences of the symptoms of mental illness. Even the simplest of tasks can be tremendously difficult. Imagine if you had someone around the corner from you, to get you over that hurdle so you can focus on what care about? We are not alone, and there are many people who care.</p>
<p>If you support my vision, please help me to raise the necessary funding to set up my website, source a network of volunteers, and develop an effective platform for members to access anonymously, help me to change what living with mental illness looks like. </p>
<p>There is no longer a need to struggle with unproductive days, angels who care, like you and me are ready to help.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As a Massage Therapist I'm always looking for the most effective ways to help increase the quality of my craft. I began this journey more than a decade ago while trying to find ways to help my wife with her Depression and Anxiety. Then a few years ago I heard about Flotation Therapy. The claims seemed too good to be true. So I investigated... I read, listened to and watched everything I could to educate myself before going for my first float. I was not disappointed. The internal calm and sense of wellbeing I got from my first float was shocking. It also lasted through the next day and on into the second. I was lucky enough to Float again within a few weeks and was again surprised by the change and the the effects lasted even longer! So, I started working on getting my Wife in a tank. Same lasting and compounding effects! That's when it finally clicked. We need this and other people do too! </p>
<p>So, we started working on bringing this dream to life. A float center funded by members and patrons, dedicated to altering the landscape of our world by making a positive impact on as many people as possible! We will be focusing on Veterans, First Responders, Healthcare Professionals and Educators. Through these endeavors we are also going to be developing community outreach programs for students and the homeless.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Float Tanks are big complicated pieces of equipment and require a LOT of specialized building preparations and materials. Each room will cost about $15,000 to build and the Tanks will cost between $30,000 and $35,000 to have made, delivered and put into use. So, our primary goal is $50,000.</li>
<li>In order to hit this target and grow past it we are offering perks so everyone near and far can participate! Wristbands, Shirts, Robes, calendars, postcards, massage and extra floats for yourself or for outreach programs!</li>
<li>Funds will go towards fulfilling our physical perks while we are in the construction phase of this project. For Patrons who have gifted Floats, we will be piloting a program where the participants will send you personalized thank you cards with handwritten messages about their experiences. </li>
<li>We are also wanting to take you all along for the ride by filming and sharing exclusive updates all throughout the construction process!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Through our outreach programs we plan to positively impact our area. Our overall goal is to give away up to 1000 floats provided by the generosity of our backers. The formula for this is simply 2:1. Every 2 floats sold generates one float for the program. Backers will receive a thank you postcard when their float is used by a participant! </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Risks &amp; Challenges</span></p>
</div><div><p>Challenges will include finding an ideal location and completing construction in a timely fashion.</p></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>

<li>Help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign through social media!</li>

The claims seemed too good to be true. So I investigated... I read, listened to and watched everything I could to educate myself before going for my first float. I was not disappointed. The internal calm and sense of wellbeing I got from my first float was shocking. It also lasted through the next day and on into the second. I was lucky enough to Float again within a few weeks and was again surprised by the change and the the effects lasted even longer! So, I started working on getting my Wife in a tank. Same lasting and compounding effects! That's when it finally clicked. We need this and other people do too! 
So, we started working on bringing this dream to life. A float center funded by members and patrons, dedicated to altering the landscape of our world by making a positive impact on as many people as possible! We will be focusing on Veterans, First Responders, Healthcare Professionals and Educators. Through these endeavors we are also going to be developing community outreach programs for students and the homeless.

What We Need & What You Get

Float Tanks are big complicated pieces of equipment and require a LOT of specialized building preparations and materials. Each room will cost about $15,000 to build and the Tanks will cost between $30,000 and $35,000 to have made, delivered and put into use. So, our primary goal is $50,000.
In order to hit this target and grow past it we are offering perks so everyone near and far can participate! Wristbands, Shirts, Robes, calendars, postcards, massage and extra floats for yourself or for outreach programs!
Funds will go towards fulfilling our physical perks while we are in the construction phase of this project. For Patrons who have gifted Floats, we will be piloting a program where the participants will send you personalized thank you cards with handwritten messages about their experiences. 
We are also wanting to take you all along for the ride by filming and sharing exclusive updates all throughout the construction process!


The Impact
Through our outreach programs we plan to positively impact our area. Our overall goal is to give away up to 1000 floats provided by the generosity of our backers. The formula for this is simply 2:1. Every 2 floats sold generates one float for the program. Backers will receive a thank you postcard when their float is used by a participant! 
Risks & Challenges
Challenges will include finding an ideal location and completing construction in a timely fashion.

<p>Mesocarp Services Australia was developed by Samantha Poole in January of 2019. Samantha is a qualified social worker with a minor in child protection and also holds a Masters in Human Resource Management. Samantha’s background is heavily working with families and children; with experience in mental health, substance abuse, case management, youth work and domestic and family violence.On a personal level, Samantha has four children aged from 2 to 13 and has a husband who has been a FIFO worker for most of their time together. Every area of knowledge Samantha has obtained is not only from obtaining degrees but most importantly through lived experience.</p>
<p>Through the personal and professional experience Samantha has lived, Mesocarp was developed on the foundations of the importance of promoting the SAFETY culture of not only businesses but in individuals lives as well. The connection between safety practice (IE; mental health, substance abuse, relationship breakdowns) within individuals lives that then impact the safety culture (how employees fulfill their job roles) and practice of workers in the field are interconnected and have a strong ability to influence each an every area of ones life, and ultimately a entire workforce/community.</p>
<p>Samantha’s passion for supporting individuals in reaching their desired goals, addressing buried issues and reconnecting relationships with loved ones is what drove the creation of Mesocarp Services. These areas of passion lead to the analysis of corporate bodies and how to create a workforce that is so entrenched in all areas of safety that the culture of the corporation promotes safer working practices, highlighting the need to address the personal aspects of a employees life eg; mental health, substance dependence, relationship break downs, grief, loss and trauma. Its about creating safer working cultures that then flow into personal lives, which in turn creates a community of individuals that are addressing their issues, not medicating or suppressing them.</p>
<p>We live in a society where everything is viewed through rose-colored glasses and life is about keeping up with the Jones’s. We have learnt to shut our doors to strangers, avoid conversations that go deeper than surface level, numb our pain with substances, build relationships based on fakeness, say no to help and support (yet drown on the inside), raise children that don’t respect authority and wonder why our younger generations are out of control.. Our society functions from fear.. Fear to be real, fear to be different, fear to be authentic and fear to feel pain....</p>
<p>Mesocarp Services is here to have the conversations that your afraid to have with anyone else. We welcome authenticity, respect individuality, support true connections, harness change and embrace difference. We want you to know that you are not alone. We want you to know if you cant have that awkward, real, authentic conversation with anyone you know, that you can have it with us. We don’t judge, we don’t hide... We are no expert in you life as you are the only one who can be. We come from a place of experience.. Through that we gained knowledge.. We are here to transfer that knowledge to you.</p>

<p><strong>Yogacharia Jnandev / Surender Sani</strong> was born in India where he lived for the first thirty three years of his life. Jnandev studied Yoga deeply academically and experientially becoming a Saddhu himself for some time and studying under several different Swamijis around India. Jnandev has studied Yogic scriptures in their original sanskrit language. He is from a Hindu family values the Yamas and Niyamas (moral and ethical codes) of Yogaas vitally important for spiritual growth and evolution, the foundations of true Yoga practice.</p>
<p>We aim to develop an eco-friendly self-sustainable organic yoga training, research and retreat centre in the beautiful countryside of Portugal. The aim is to make the ashram truly international where people from all over the world will travel to to learn &amp; teach Yogic practices. The ashram is based on 21 acres of pine, cork oak, and olive trees at the moment along with plenty of wild lavender, and other natural plants. It is based on  a big hill with quite a bit flat on the top and sloping to north, east, and south. It touches a seasonal stream at the north end following olive field, and pine forest on the slop. At the east end it touches the river with a steep slope full of pine and cork oak trees and wildness.</p>
<p>We aim to preserve most of the forest and create plenty of foot-path to enjoy walking in the woods and enjoy nature, explore birds and wildness of beautiful Portuguese unspoiled nature. OUR GOAL IS ALSO TO PLANT MORE TREES WITH ALL OF YOUR HELP TO BRING OUR CARBON PRINT DOWN.</p>
<p>With your help we can create a haven for people to help with spiritual growth, improve physical and mental health, and to help nurture teachers so they may take what they have learned to help themselves and others.</p>

<p>Our aim is to raise £15,000. All monies raised will go into the building and development of the ashram.The property already have an old stone build with no roof. Structure is solid and good to be used in our development project. We aim to raise the walls and put a flat roof with natural clay tiles or bricks on roof top floor for yoga decking.</p>
<p>From Yoga decking or shala you will be looking out nature beautiful nature full of forests, range of mountains in 360degree all around.</p>
<p>Beneath we will have an open kitchen, dinning-cum-satsanga/yoga room if we have to be indoors due to weather looking out at east-south to mountains and forest.</p>
<p>To accommodate yoga students and seekers we are aiming to develop five log-cabins with two single beds to accommodate up to ten yogis/yoginis at once.   </p>
<p><strong>Compost toilets and Shower</strong>- On the site we would like to develop two compost toilets and showers. All the human waste will be used in our organic fruit garden as well as the water used in showers, will be used to water the plants too. We aim to not use any chemicals, shampoos<a name=""_GoBack"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>, hair conditioners, soaps, etc on site to preserve the beauty and keep it clean and organic to best possible.</p>
<p><strong>Camping</strong>- We will create few decked areas to put some tents up if you fancy camping on site and help us develop the ashram in exchange of accommodation and yoga classes.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Greetings: </p>
<p>I hope that you are finding some peace in these troubled times. My name is Dannah McKellar Ntaka, and I am a medical researcher and founder of The Campus of Care Healthcare Corporation. The Campus of Care is a public health and medical research institute that is committed to pelvic and hormonal research studies for women of all ages and ethnic backgrounds. No woman is too young or too old to participate in the McKellar Longitudinal Women's Health Study (MLWHS). We are concerned with the technological and clinical aspects of solving problems like infertility, osteoporosis, fibroid tumors, maternal and infant mortality, HPV,  Zika, and other emerging viruses an their effects on the whole woman. <br/><br/>But there is another concern that continues to show up as our subjects anonymously report in their monthly biological health journals: toxic stress. Increasingly, over the past five years, we have seen women report their concerns over gun violence, police brutality, and ethnic profiling. As researchers, we have tracked the correlation between these concerns and health outcomes such as mental health diagnoses, hypertension, and exacerbation of other chronic illnesses. <br/><br/>As I entered the year 2020, both personally and as a business leader, I made a conscious decision to help others cope with loss. This year is the third year of the tragic death of my eldest son, Toivo Kotyi Ntaka. Our family and friends were devastated by the untimely death of T. Kotyi Ntaka, who was a brilliant young man. Kotyi was an entrepreneur, having acquired his first triplex apartment building and was diligently remodeling each unit. Kotyi was a self-taught chef and expressed an interest in baking at the age of two when he donned his chef's hat and attempted to make cookies in our kitchen floor when we turned our backs. Kotyi was a linguist (spoke three languages), and was a compassionate advocate for the homeless and troubled young men. Kotyi was an officer in the Latin Club while in high school and helped me tutor medical students in differential equations when he was still in high school. He is sorely missed by our family, friends, and the community her served. I especially miss him since we always shared our birthday week in August.<br/><br/>Or company launched the Grief Management Conference Call as a way to help more people cope with grief and find a new normal. Prolonged and unsupported grief can lead to poor health outcomes. Even before the emerging SARS-Cov-2 pandemic and the subsequent economic disaster for many families, we expanded our grief conversations to include:</p>
<p>Loss of Income</p>
<p>Loss of Normalcy </p>
<p>Loss of Employment</p>
<p>And Loss of Marriage.</p>
<p>Then add the pandemic, continued murders of unarmed citizens, and civil unrest to our current lives. People are hurting across the country: of all ages and races. Citizens of the world are expressing outrage. The Campus of Care Healthcare Corporation is raising funds to heal people through our Grief Management Calls. We are planning virtual dinners with those who are struggling to cope, trips to museums and historic monuments, and the purchase of grief journals and books with powerful messages of hope. </p>
<p>Here is what we need and what we can offer you!</p>
<p>We are seeking to raise $3,000 for the other ongoing development of our classroom at our DeSoto, Texas location. We need new digital white boards and overhead projectors. We also need to purchase journals and grief books in large quantities for the participants of the group. These materials will assist our therapists. Some of our participants have experienced multiple forms of grief and trauma and have never sought professional help.</p>
<p>Even if we do not reach our entire funding goal, we will still be able to purchase some needed tools to expand this grief workshop. </p>
<p>As a perk for any gift of $20.00 or more, we will send you one of our 6-layer custom made, industrial masks. These masks are comfortable and stylish and have an interior filter, as well as a pocket for an additional disposable filter. <br/><br/>You may also collect a mug from the sporting team of your choice as a token of our appreciation. </p>
<p>Gifts of over $50.00 will receive a tote made of high quality material. These totes may be used to carry books or files. </p>
<p>No gift is too small. We know the power of serving and being supported by the village. The Campus of Care Healthcare Corporation serves clients who have means to pay, as well as those members of the community who are underserved and may not have financial means. For this reason, we are asking the community to help us help the underserved during these troubling times. Our impact through our own company credit has already been impactful. Our normal means of raising funds for our growth is through hosting programs in the arts. Due to social distancing and quarantine, we have already canceled two opera concerts. Upgrades in our digital equipment for our conference room and classroom will enable us to offer concerts and public health lectures while abiding by social distance rules. </p>
<p>We are a public health institute that teaches CPR, disaster preparedness, mitigation, and recovery. Our Master Development Plan has a disaster plan that has allowed us to pivot instead of being crushed by the pandemic. We are dedicated to remain in business in good times and in difficult ones. Science and technology go hand in hand, and we are willing to evolve and explore new ways of reaching our goals. As a company that relies heavily on lunches, brunches, excursions, and dinners to do capital improvement campaigns, we have pivoted to a digital format in an amazing way. We always relied on Zoom, but have increased our Zoom meetings from 5 per week too 5 per day. We are indeed committed.     </p>
<p>We know that their may be challenges in fundraising right now with so much economic certainty.    </p>
</div><div>
<p>There are many ways that you can assist us! Please share this site. We would love for you to tell your friends and family who may be experiencing grief of their own. We truly believe that we are in this recovery together. The Campus of Care has built the type of infrastructure through our public health education format, that can be an asset to our community. Please view our website to learn more about our initiatives. Thank you for the time you have taken to familiarize yourself with our institute. </p>

<h2>Hi everyone!</h2>
<h3><strong>Here's the short story...</strong></h3>
<p>Yoga is a gateway for many people to connect and understand the power within themselves. I am one of many who have felt the healing impact of yoga and mindfulness and have felt called to share it. I'm enrolling in Yoga Teacher Training and need a little support funding it. Through this experience, my academic knowledge of mental health and insight on healing, my goal is to share this mind-body practice to those who may find it to be inaccessible or exclusive and am committed to support equitable access to wellness. Please support by donating or sharing this campaign. To show my gratitude, each donor will receive a gift (redeem them in the perks section) and if by chance, we exceed the goal, I will donate to an amazing organization with a similar mission.</p>
<p>With love and gratitude,</p>

<h3>Here's the long story...</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>At a young age, I was exposed to healing through my grandmother. She would ""hilot"" us through massage. It was one of her many trades. Sometimes, she would read my palm and give me insight. She taught me to dance, cook and simply to live life with meaning and take care of one another. When she passed, I was 17 and in college.  I grieved in ways that weren't healthy for me. And the cliche of ""when it rained, it poured"" manifested itself. My long term relationship ended and I lost my job within months of each other. That's a lot of emotions for anyone, let alone someone who just transitioned into adulthood. I had family support, friends, and ways to positively cope but my traumas seemed to haunt me including past experiences I had no idea I needed to deal with. In retrospect, this time in my life was the catalyst for my healing journey to truly begin. When I went home to spend time with family, I enrolled in a community college during summer break and was immersed in a beginning hatha yoga class. While I expected a physical practice, I did not expect the emotional and spiritual influence that it would have on me. The guided practice and the holding of our postures inspired reflection, heart-opening, truth and self-healing. All of which I've been craving ever since. The journey so far has been winding, wild and transformative to say the least, but it's taken me as far as to complete my master's in counseling, offer emotional healing to others, and stimulate my growth as a student, expanding my knowledge on wellness and other healing modalities. It's been nearly a decade since that yoga class and it seems only fitting to be able to give back through the practice that has been the gateway to my own healing.</i></p>
<h3>The goal...</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I was on a mission to find a yoga studio that had a great balance of challenging asana practice, a strong relationship to community, and spiritual connection and education. I found it all at Happy-U Yoga in OB with a unique positive psychology approach, bridging the gap between western and eastern understandings of wellness. <i>(Those that know me, know I nerd out over positive psychology practices, so it was a plus.) </i>I fell in love with this studio, the people, and overall, just had a good feeling about what opportunities they provided. The cost for yoga teacher training (YTT) is $2197. My goal is $3000 to cover the cost of training, materials such as books, and shipping costs for goodies I'm sending to you.</p>
<p>If we happen to make anything over that goal, I will donate to <a href=""http://www.ogyoga.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">OG Yoga</a>, a nonprofit organization who supports healing in vulnerable communities by teaching a trauma-informed curriculum to teachers and makes mindfulness and yoga practices accessible to those who wouldn't normally be able to take a yoga class. Please read up on them if you get a chance.</p>
<p><i>Side note: If you're in the San Diego area, check out <a href=""http://www.happyuyoga.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Happy-U</a>– they offer $5 drop in classes multiple times a week.

<p>Nous la voulons régie par des femmes, et focalisée sur le plaisir des femmes. C’est pourquoi le nom de « L’Impératrice » nous a paru comme une évidence !   </p>
<p>Notre particularité : en plus des traditionnels produits de beauté et de soins permettant de mettre en valeur notre esthétique, nous pensons qu’il est temps de se centrer sur notre entière féminité. Pour cela, nous souhaitons proposer une boutique dans laquelle nous nous sentirons en confiance, un espace où nous pourrons enfin nous découvrir ou aider nos conjoints à nous découvrir et explorer tous nos sens afin d’atteindre le bien-être.   </p>
<p>Que vous soyez célibataire en quête de plaisir personnel ; en couple en quête de développer d’autres sensations ; à la recherche d’ouvrages et d’ateliers vous permettant de vous reconstruire à la suite d’un traumatisme, vous êtes au bon endroit ! </p>
<p>Il s'agit tout simplement de ramener de l’amour et du plaisir, sans aller les chercher ailleurs, en se les apportant à soi. </p>
<p>Vous pourrez naviguer dans la boutique et découvrir nos huiles de massage, bougies d’ambiance, prêt-à-porter et lingerie raffinée, bijoux révélateurs, ouvrages d’éducation sexuelle et de prise de confiance en soi, œuvres d’art, ainsi que des accessoires pour explorer et développer votre sensualité et sexualité.  Nous proposerons également des ateliers de découverte et de rééducation avec des experts dans un environnement accueillant, stimulant et sans jugement.</p>
<p>Oublions le self-control, il est l’heure du self-pleasure sous toutes ses formes. Rendons sa puissance à la femme !  </p>
<p>Serez-vous de la partie avec nous ? </p>
<h3>Notre Besoin et Votre Rétribution</h3>
<p>Nous partons de zéro donc c’est un gros investissement ! Et dû à un nombre impressionnant de refus de financement par les banques – pour qui le projet n'est pas en accord avec leurs image et réputation – nous nous tournons aujourd’hui vers la Communauté.  </p>
<p>Nous sommes en quête de 15750 €, répartis comme suit :</p>
<ul>
<li>Caisse enregistreuse + logiciel de caisse / inventaire + terminal de paiement CB : 3,000 € </li>

<h3>Welcome pleasure seekers, </h3>
<p>We are three sisters, ""the 3 A's"" – all around our 30’s – from different backgrounds (health, engineering, and human factors) who have the opportunity – we don’t believe in luck ? – and the passion to create a special feminine wellness boutique. </p>
<p>We want it female-owned, female-run, and female pleasure-focused. Hence why the name of “L’Impératrice” (The Empress) seemed obvious! ? </p>
<p>Our particularity:  in addition to the traditional beauty and care products, we believe it is time to focus on our full femininity. We want to offer a boutique in which we will feel confident, a space where we can finally discover ourselves or help our partners to discover us and explore all our senses to achieve well-being. </p>
<p>Whether you are single looking for personal pleasure; a couple in search of other sensations; looking for books and workshops to help you rebuild yourself after a trauma, you have come to the right place! </p>
<p>Self-love and self-care are our priorities. It is a simple matter of bringing back love and pleasure, without looking elsewhere but within. </p>
<p>You will be able to browse through our boutique and discover massage oils, mood candles, sexy prêt-à-porter and exquisite lingerie, body jewelry as well as accessories, sexual education books and artwork. We want it to be a safe space to explore and develop your sensuality and sexuality. </p>
<p>We will also offer discovery workshops with experts on sex education in a welcoming, stimulating, and non-judgmental environment. </p>
<p>Forget about self-control, it is time for self-pleasure in all its forms.  </p>
<p>Let's redefine sexuality together on our own terms and empower women! </p>
<p>So, will you join us? </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are starting from scratch, so it is a massive investment! And after many refusals from banks to finance us – as “erotic” seems too damaging to their image and reputation – we want to try and see if you, the Community, would like to support us through crowdfunding. </p>
<p>We are seeking 15,750 €, to be used as follows :  </p>
<ul>
<li>Cash register machine + cash / inventory software + card payment terminal : 3,000 € </li>
<li>Display furniture and seating : 3,000 € </li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Let's remove taboos, reprogram negative restrictive ideals set by our society, and replace them with well-being. We wish to empower women by allowing them to retrieve their decisive, audacious, seductive, and romantic facets.  </p>

<h3>
<br/>1. Why Lanzarote?</h3>
<p>Over the last 6 years we have trained and competed in 19 different countries around the world and we’ve chosen Lanzarote for our European venture. </p>
<p>It exceeds most freediving expectations, such as water temperatures that enable us to train all year round, minimal water movement, unlimited depth and all that within a Government Protected Biosphere Reserve. Many experts consider Lanzarote’s dive sites to be the best in Europe, and it is known for its underwater museum - Museo Atlantico, a must see. </p>
<p>Lanzarote is easily accessible from most European cities with more than 90 direct flights a day.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511778157/tongmhhcffqzj2tot4yb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>
<br/>2. What is our idea?</h3>
<p>Our goal is to create an amazing freediving location, where freedivers of all abilities and nationalities can come to meet and practice their passion all year round within a great and safe environment.</p>
<p>We are now expanding our Freediving Lanzarote project - to include a state of the art boat which will provide the ultimate safe freediving experience, and give the flexibility to access the best daily conditions and sites. Of course the boat is the vital component, but we will also have new customized onshore facilities at Puerto Calero Marina.<br/> </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q4KbYvmECu8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<p>Puerto Calero provides a peaceful location where people can relax, get back in touch with nature, play, learn and explore. It is just a 15 minute drive from the airport and has a wide range of accommodation within the vicinity. </p>
<p>Freediving Lanzarote Club and Centre will provide educational freediving courses, training and coaching sessions, specialist workshops, community events, annual freediving competitions and trips to Lanzarote’s best dive sites. </p>
<p>Within a safe environment for beginners to progress, to high performance athletes, the center will help to grow the freediving stars of the future. Whatever your age or ability Freediving Lanzarote will be open to you.</p>
<h3>
<br/>3. Why Crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>Freediving is about community, and we want freedivers to play an important role in this very ambitious project. This project is for you, our club members, friends and freedivers of today and those yet to come.</p>
<p>Funding this initiative will help build the purpose-designed freediving centre and purchase a rigid-inflatable boat with specialised safety equipment. Our plan is to have the operation up and running in February 2018.</p>
<p>We have set a goal of 50,000€ as a minimal target, but in reality we need more to complete it as imagined. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511535800/wec9efmolh852jvl1olc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
