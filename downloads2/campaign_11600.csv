</h3><p>DragonGuard  Artist Kevin Sharpe here .</p><p>I'd like to Introduce you to <strong>Dragon Guard.</strong> Before I do, I want to tell you about myself. I'm a 25 year veteran of the comics Industry. I've worked for <i><strong>Marvel , DC , Dynamite Entertainment, Image , Crossgen, and IDW </strong></i>for starters. I've drawn some of the most popular characters in comics, From <i>Thor, to Xtreme Xmen, to Black panther  and Generation X and Nova as well as Legion of SuperHeroes, Man of Steel,  Katana - Shazam, and Arsenal</i>.

To remedy his boredom, the Dragon would demand sacrifices from the village below.Many generations passed and the citizens grew weary of the incessant sacrificing. They begged the Dragon for a break. The Dragon, in his arrogance, obliged. He offered them a wager, that if a champion was sent who could defeat him, he would imbue the victor with his strength. This story was widely regarded as an old wives tale… A mysterious warrior, known as the “Man with the Dragon Sword,” wanders Japan in search of redemption for his past ridden with sin. Those he meets regard him as a hero, but those from his past life cannot forget the monster that lies within!Tofu, once the top ninja of the Shogun's army, now hell bent on getting vengeance for what was taken from her.In old Japan, there was rumored to be a Ramen so good, it could heal the world.

<h2>What would you sacrifice to save a loved one from a fate worse than death?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>That is the question Ashyara faces on a daily basis in this broken, dying world.  Mortally wounded and running out of time, she was forced into a deal with the devil.  Now she continues her quest well beyond her natural lifespan.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Her existence sustained by the consumption of souls, Ashyara and her demonic partner Qaj find themselves in a bit of a predicament.  Their target is nearby, but a series of unfortunate events have left them completely drained with no time to recover.  And if that wasn't bad enough, another threat approaches the nearby town of Strin.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Will Ashyara give in to demonic influence and sacrifice a few to save many?  Will she decide it's not her problem and let the town fend for itself?  Or will she offer herself up in an attempt to save everyone?  Why do we even need to ask?</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>The Characters:</h2>
<h3>Ashyara</h3>
<p>The hero of our story. A former knight whose centuries long journey has refined her swordsmanship skills to perfection (on a good day), earning her the nickname ""Blade Devil."" Or maybe that was because of her Exoskeleton armor...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581378519/ttsasu3l7zqmd6gaq1lb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Qaj</h3>
<p>Ashyara's demonic partner. While extremely weak on his own, he is capable of greatly boosting the strength of his contractor. As long as said contractor keeps him well fed anyway. And we know what demons like to eat!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581316579/v79pmdai1z8h3p2ab2x3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Iuna:</h3>
<p>The Witch of the Wastes. She is credited with destroying most of the world centuries ago, and is recognized as one of the most powerful beings in existence. And she is Ashyara's quarry. Her broken mind is all that stands between the world and total annihilation.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583085382/yvptb1foclwvtng7tec5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Hunters:</h3>
<p>Special Forces who spend their lives fighting humanity's greatest threats in the wilderness. It's only because of their sacrifice that average people can sleep peacefully within safe, walled cities. Though some tend to forget this fact.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583081254/krfnfhy5vj7a7v4zzzwo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Barrel Shota:</h3>
<p>Just an average boy who's simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, there's nothing special about him at all... Or is there?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583081827/k8a6a61zqem6ojtndqch.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>We already have at least half of the book finished (I say at least because it keeps growing...) and it's coming out regardless of how much money we raise.  How well this campaign does determines if there's enough interest to continue the series.</p>
<p>The only way this isn't happening is if either me or my artist die, end up in a coma, or some other freak accident occurs.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
<p>$65,000 <strong>REACHED</strong>: Each physical book will come with a pinup poster of its cover, AND this one of Moth-chan (Just a sample, with a simple background, logo, etc. to be added)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583283446/qkgcjtleuhsh65r8yglz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>$90,000 <strong>REACHED</strong>: A monster(girl) bestiary will be added to the book, explaining what all these critters in the Blade Devil universe are and making them even more pleasing to look at!</p>
<p>$100,000 <strong>REACHED</strong>: Foil covers on all books!  We'll try a few things to see if it looks better to put foil on the entire cover or just key parts of it, but we'll make sure these books dominate your shelves.</p>
<p>$125,000 <strong>REACHED</strong>: All signed copies of the book will be signed by me AND the artist (provided there are no travel bans getting in the way by then).</p>

</div></div>","What would you sacrifice to save a loved one from a fate worse than death?
 
That is the question Ashyara faces on a daily basis in this broken, dying world.  Mortally wounded and running out of time, she was forced into a deal with the devil.  Now she continues her quest well beyond her natural lifespan.
 

 
Her existence sustained by the consumption of souls, Ashyara and her demonic partner Qaj find themselves in a bit of a predicament.  Their target is nearby, but a series of unfortunate events have left them completely drained with no time to recover.  And if that wasn't bad enough, another threat approaches the nearby town of Strin.
 

 
Will Ashyara give in to demonic influence and sacrifice a few to save many?  Will she decide it's not her problem and let the town fend for itself?  Or will she offer herself up in an attempt to save everyone?  Why do we even need to ask?
 

 
In the #CurrentYear comic book industry, which is filled with villains being sold as heroes, that sadly becomes a question we actually need to consider.  From this desolate, hopeless landscape, witness a new hero rise to become the ray of hope the world needs!
 

 
50 Page Main Story, with 3 side stories!
 
Haunted - Ashyara is stalked by a stealthy foe that refuses to engage her head on and slowly whittles away her strength.



Deadly Detour - A squad of Ignom Hunters face off against a fallen brother.



+ a preview of what's going on elsewhere in the world...



 


 
Two cover choices, with one extra variant...

The Characters:
Ashyara
The hero of our story. A former knight whose centuries long journey has refined her swordsmanship skills to perfection (on a good day), earning her the nickname ""Blade Devil."" Or maybe that was because of her Exoskeleton armor...

 
Qaj
Ashyara's demonic partner. While extremely weak on his own, he is capable of greatly boosting the strength of his contractor. As long as said contractor keeps him well fed anyway. And we know what demons like to eat!

 
Iuna:
The Witch of the Wastes. She is credited with destroying most of the world centuries ago, and is recognized as one of the most powerful beings in existence. And she is Ashyara's quarry. Her broken mind is all that stands between the world and total annihilation.

 
Hunters:
Special Forces who spend their lives fighting humanity's greatest threats in the wilderness. It's only because of their sacrifice that average people can sleep peacefully within safe, walled cities. Though some tend to forget this fact.

 
Barrel Shota:
Just an average boy who's simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, there's nothing special about him at all... Or is there?

 
Risks & Challenges
We already have at least half of the book finished (I say at least because it keeps growing...) and it's coming out regardless of how much money we raise.  How well this campaign does determines if there's enough interest to continue the series.
The only way this isn't happening is if either me or my artist die, end up in a coma, or some other freak accident occurs.
 
Stretch Goals
$65,000 REACHED: Each physical book will come with a pinup poster of its cover, AND this one of Moth-chan (Just a sample, with a simple background, logo, etc. to be added)

 
$90,000 REACHED: A monster(girl) bestiary will be added to the book, explaining what all these critters in the Blade Devil universe are and making them even more pleasing to look at!
$100,000 REACHED: Foil covers on all books!  We'll try a few things to see if it looks better to put foil on the entire cover or just key parts of it, but we'll make sure these books dominate your shelves.
$125,000 REACHED: All signed copies of the book will be signed by me AND the artist (provided there are no travel bans getting in the way by then).
$150,000 REACHED: Fanart Gallery added to the book!
$175,000 REACHED: ""Xenodevil"" jam cover art print with each book.  Be sure to check out Xenotype (also on Indiegogo) as well if you'd like this as a cover!

<h3>RAGETALITY's WAR is a 56-page Perfect Bound Graphic Novel. Featuring 48 pages of story and 8 pages of bonus content. Every physical book automatically receives 2 BONUS <i>campaign exclusive</i> collector trading cards.</h3>
<p><strong>RAGETALITY's WAR</strong> is the <i><strong>ALL NEW</strong></i> pedal to the metal installment from the Ninety Four comic book universe, brought to you by the series creator, writer, artist, and colorist <strong>SHELBY ROBERTSON</strong>. At the beginning of this story, you are catapulted into the world of the future. We witness the aftermath of Ragetality, Slamm, and Clinton's haphazardly botched time-travel missions from the original Ninety Four series. They got a score to settle with their employer who set them up, but there's a plethora of obstacles set in their path. Hot on their trail are Painn, Lana, and Alanis, who happen to be their rival time-travelling hired guns. This book is a melting pot of Sci-Fi, Superhero, Anti-Hero, Humor, with a splash of 90's Nostalgia. ALSO be sure to consider adding the INDRAWN Ashcan set, which is 48 pages of ALL-NEW story that ties directly into Ragetality's War #1. It serves as an Intermission of sorts. We are offering 2 different Cover Editions for the <strong>RAGETALITY's WAR</strong> #1. Each physical copy includes 2 campaign exclusive trading cards, (PLUS all applicable Stretch Goal items in every order).</p>

Now they are in the middle of a time twisting world of gods and monsters, and must juggle Saving the World and Paying the Bills!STW is a genre bending comic blending the humor, and sensibilities of 90's underground comics, with the high flying action of traditional super hero comics.BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT:""It is like a better version of Ghost World with boobs.""- Adam Lawson""One of the newest and exciting voices and art in indy comics today.

<h3><i><strong>COMPASS COMICS</strong> presents the MUST HAVE comic book of 2021!</i></h3>
<p>Hello, my friends and welcome to the second Compass Comics IGG campaign! I'm Graham Nolan, a 38 year veteran of the comic book industry, writer/artist and long time Batman illustrator as well as the co-creator of Bane! I am having the time of my life creating a new universe that is centered around horror, monsters, sci-fi and the supernatural. All of my books will interconnect to form a connected universe that my characters and events will cohabitate. I am passionate about comics and the art form. I hope you are too and will come along for the ride!</p>
<p>Thanks for taking a look and backing true independent comics!</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Graham</p>

<h3><strong>The Story</strong></h3>
<p>It's 1957 and the Russians have just launched Sputnik into orbit. The world was changing and WWII veteran Travis Houston was struggling to adapt.</p>
<p>All Travis wanted when he mustered out of the Marine Corps, at the end of WWll, was some peace and quiet and a safe place to raise his son, James, but the horrors he experienced in the Pacific, and the death of his wife, have left him empty and distant.</p>
<p>The meteor shower changed all that. Only it wasn't a meteor shower. It was an invasion. Creatures from another world want ours, and the only thing standing between them and us is a man, a boy, and his dog.</p>
<p>The Houstons are vastly outnumbered, but they are Texans and they have each other...so the odds might just be even.</p>

The Story
It's 1957 and the Russians have just launched Sputnik into orbit. The world was changing and WWII veteran Travis Houston was struggling to adapt.
All Travis wanted when he mustered out of the Marine Corps, at the end of WWll, was some peace and quiet and a safe place to raise his son, James, but the horrors he experienced in the Pacific, and the death of his wife, have left him empty and distant.
The meteor shower changed all that. Only it wasn't a meteor shower. It was an invasion. Creatures from another world want ours, and the only thing standing between them and us is a man, a boy, and his dog.
The Houstons are vastly outnumbered, but they are Texans and they have each other...so the odds might just be even.

We're all giving our very best, pouring ourselves into this book to make it more than worth the cost.</p><p>Shinobi Sasquatch was conceived somewhat foolishly, but as I fleshed out the world and its inhabitants, I realized there was a lot more story potential than I expected. I have since grown to truly love the concept, characters, and setting, and Shino (as some call him) has grown to hold a special place in my heart along with my most favorite characters.</p><p>This campaign will be a milestone in all our careers. While we've all done paid work in the industry, this will be the first book to be exclusively our own. If we fund this one, we fully plan to keep releasing more of Shino's stories any way we can. </p><p>Speaking of funding...</p><p>We have a ton of awesome perks to choose from, which you can peruse at your leisure, but first, a few notes:</p><p>The <strong>Double Trouble</strong> tier is designed so you can join us in making some money. Grab the two books for $40 then sell one on eBay after the campaign closes, and you're likely to make your money back and then some.</p><p>The <strong>Bag o' SQUAG</strong> tier features two DIFFERENT posters; one is an 11x17 fold-out poster of the cover, and one is an 8.5x11 print of one of the book's most amazing splash pages. Trust me when I say, you're going to be tempted to just cut out one of the splash pages to hang on your wall. Let us save you the pain. Just get the Bag o' SQUAG and you're all set.</p><p>This tier also gets you a pack of three trading cards which we're calling sketch cards. Don't get confused by the name. These are not original sketches by Rob, That would make this tier a lot more pricey. No, these are beautiful trading cards, with the cover art on the back, and black &amp; white sketches of the three main characters on the front.</p><p>Lastly, the <strong>Drawn-In</strong> tiers are both great choices for fans, but they may also be great gag gifts for fans with deep pockets and a friend, enemy, or frienemy they would like to see eviscerated, decapitated, or otherwise mutilated within the pages of Shinobi Sasquatch.</p><p>With that out of the way, please, go check out the tiers for yourself!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556668819/qfizqcoafqitccsnqgw9.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556681265/zsmzcxohzzutkqqxhh5w.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556679981/kgv5tr4gdf4nhdhecij9.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556679900/yvheptmmy8he9kh7iffk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564165326/pzz1svllk6ph5nzaxxuj.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565657974/oogmq5hzdfm8hp2bytwh.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570487094/zqmpqz7pgenz8g9aeugn.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570487117/xlcjedmgwuhpcjbhqhf0.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575923128/bk37f4tqkobpo4bek0ee.png"" src=""""/></p><div>

</div></div>","84 pages of pure awesome.From the creative team of writer/creator Cal Jameson, artist Rob Willis, colorist Paul Bilick, and letterer Eric Weathers, Shinobi Sasquatch aims to continue to raise the bar on quality in indie comics. We're all giving our very best, pouring ourselves into this book to make it more than worth the cost.Shinobi Sasquatch was conceived somewhat foolishly, but as I fleshed out the world and its inhabitants, I realized there was a lot more story potential than I expected. I have since grown to truly love the concept, characters, and setting, and Shino (as some call him) has grown to hold a special place in my heart along with my most favorite characters.This campaign will be a milestone in all our careers. While we've all done paid work in the industry, this will be the first book to be exclusively our own. If we fund this one, we fully plan to keep releasing more of Shino's stories any way we can. Speaking of funding...We have a ton of awesome perks to choose from, which you can peruse at your leisure, but first, a few notes:The Double Trouble tier is designed so you can join us in making some money. Grab the two books for $40 then sell one on eBay after the campaign closes, and you're likely to make your money back and then some.The Bag o' SQUAG tier features two DIFFERENT posters; one is an 11x17 fold-out poster of the cover, and one is an 8.5x11 print of one of the book's most amazing splash pages. Trust me when I say, you're going to be tempted to just cut out one of the splash pages to hang on your wall. Let us save you the pain. Just get the Bag o' SQUAG and you're all set.This tier also gets you a pack of three trading cards which we're calling sketch cards. Don't get confused by the name. These are not original sketches by Rob, That would make this tier a lot more pricey. No, these are beautiful trading cards, with the cover art on the back, and black & white sketches of the three main characters on the front.Lastly, the Drawn-In tiers are both great choices for fans, but they may also be great gag gifts for fans with deep pockets and a friend, enemy, or frienemy they would like to see eviscerated, decapitated, or otherwise mutilated within the pages of Shinobi Sasquatch.With that out of the way, please, go check out the tiers for yourself!


The stated monetary goal is calculated to pay Rob and Paul a portion of what they're worth, and cover printing and other costs (ISBN, mailers, barcodes, bags & boards). It does not include paying me (Cal), so we'll have a stretch goal that features both a paycheck for Cal and a reward for backers.

<h3>LEMONS won't cut it on this one!</h3>
<p>Guys, I need your help!</p>
<p>Last year I successfully funded and fulfilled a smaller project called ""BLACK and RED"". The response was fantastic and I am so grateful for the support then. But making a book like this is gonna take a little more cheddar.</p>
<p>This project will start as a perfect bound <strong>96 page </strong>soft cover spectacular with the opportunity for a couple of surprises via future <strong>stretch goals</strong>. But to get there, I'm gonna need you guys to get the word out and make some noise about <strong>DOOMKICKER</strong> to all your friends (even if you can't give at this moment).</p>
<p>Right now the funds we raise will go to the print run, my letterer, <strong>'Electric' Eric Weathers</strong>, an as of yet announced colorist and myself, your ever lovin' brown eyed JERKMONGER, for the bulk of the work. This book is scheduled to ship in February 2020 but I want to beat that deadline by a couple of months so your support is critical. The more we raise, the more I can do and sooner to get this sequential Tyranosaur into your collection.</p>
<p>Some of my perks will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exclusive Prints</li>
<li>Original 9x12 Headshots of Hank and 'The Evil'</li>
<li>Get yourself drawn in the comic</li>
<li>and a few more surprises coming soon!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>I also want to include some of the 'Art Of' material in the back of the book.</p>

ENTER THE DOOMKICKER!
Hi, my name is Elliot Fernandez, but you might know me as the Invincible JERKMONGER on social media. I am an American/Puerto Rican illustrator, designer and comic book artist with over 20 years experience. I've spent most of my professional career working on other peoples dreams from Harley-Davidson to MARVEL ANIMATION to DC Comics and much, much more. But now I get to work on one of my own dreams.
 
THE STORY
DOOMKICKER is about Hank, a frustrated small town security guard who wants to live up to his fathers legacy as the town Sheriff but finds himself stuck. He stumbles on a local conspiracy that will turn his world upside down. What if doing the right thing cost you your soul?
My partner on DOOMKICKER is 'Dangerous' Doug TenNapel (creator of Earth Worm Jim) and we've teamed up to bring you a supernatural suspense adventure that will shake the Halls of Valhalla.
But... Beware! 
This comic is NOT for the faint of heart!!! This thing is packed to the gills with breakneck adventure, chilling mystery and, oh yeah (my favorite), creepy things that go bump in the night!
This is where you come in! Doug and I have a dream to bring back that classic comic goodness that seems to be missing on bookshelves across this mortal plane. This is the story of the every-man in all of us versus the darkness of the great unknown. The story of good versus evil with all the grey in between. With your help we can fire up this bad boy and help Hank save his town and maybe... even the world...  Are you ready?
LET'S GO KICK SOME DOOM!
 
Variant Cover Line Art by Mike S. Miller










 
LEMONS won't cut it on this one!
Guys, I need your help!
Last year I successfully funded and fulfilled a smaller project called ""BLACK and RED"". The response was fantastic and I am so grateful for the support then. But making a book like this is gonna take a little more cheddar.
This project will start as a perfect bound 96 page soft cover spectacular with the opportunity for a couple of surprises via future stretch goals. But to get there, I'm gonna need you guys to get the word out and make some noise about DOOMKICKER to all your friends (even if you can't give at this moment).
Right now the funds we raise will go to the print run, my letterer, 'Electric' Eric Weathers, an as of yet announced colorist and myself, your ever lovin' brown eyed JERKMONGER, for the bulk of the work. This book is scheduled to ship in February 2020 but I want to beat that deadline by a couple of months so your support is critical. The more we raise, the more I can do and sooner to get this sequential Tyranosaur into your collection.
Some of my perks will include:

Exclusive Prints
Original 9x12 Headshots of Hank and 'The Evil'
Get yourself drawn in the comic
and a few more surprises coming soon!


I also want to include some of the 'Art Of' material in the back of the book.

 
As Doug says, you are my marketing plan...
I need you guys to back this project!
I need you guys to share this campaign with your friends!
I need you guys to brace yourselves....

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Tadhya is EXPANDING</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hey Guys,It’s Quinn. We are back with another update on the campaign. Now, as you may know, we had a setback last month when our <a href=""https://www.quinnhoward.net/post/good-news-tadhya-is-almost-finished-being-drawn-bad-news-is"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">colorist's hard drive crashed</a>. He lost almost all of the colorwork he had done. We announced then that we would not be putting the book out in December, which was an ambitious release date to start with. That was several weeks ago and thankfully 50 pages have now been fully drawn and colored!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Now onto the next part! We realized some time ago that 48 pages would not be sufficient to tell the entire story of this first volume of Tadhya. We have decided to add 20-30 more pages to the book in order to fully breathe life into the world we have created. Now because we have decided to add more pages, this means the book will require more time to produce. At this point, we are looking at a release around March!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We truly believe this is our best option in order to present you guys with a product of premium artistic and physical quality. Check out our <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQimwolfEiw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BRAND NEW Tadhya Trailer</a>, featuring art by the Amazing Matthew Weldon and Colors done by the Phenomenal Jean-Francois Beaulieu.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">EPIC HORROR FANTASY GRAPHIC NOVEL ON WITCHES</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Tadhya Exordium is a 48 Page Graphic Novel, the first of three in a series. Tadhya is the story of a young girl born into a noble family... but also into the hands of a manipulative coven. With darkness as their cover, the witches conjured their dark works and brought forth Tadhya-but will Tadhya be theirs to bend to their will? Or have they unknowingly, through their own hubris, unleashed something upon the world which will finally fracture the delicate balance they have tried desperately for centuries to maintain.</p>

The Celtic mythology surrounding Balor, his ""Evil Eye"", and the Fomori of the Otherworld were adapted to form the fantasy backdrop of this story.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Neil Gaiman: </strong>Long have I been a fan of Gaiman's work in both graphic and contemporary novels. The work Gaiman did in Sandman was highly inspirational for Tadhya. Neil Gaiman's highly symbolic narrative style and metaphorical form of storytelling is endlessly compelling. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Stephen King: </strong>Steven King has been well known as the ""King"" of horror for decades now. Stephen King has been able to, through his stories and books, tap into the deep primal fears that we have all have. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>George RR Martin: </strong>It is arguable that Martin changed the course of modern fantasy. In his acclaimed A Song of Ice and Fire series, there is no black and white, no pure good and evil. The characters themselves seem grounded in reality while simultaneously existing within a seamless fantasy backdrop.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>H.P. Lovecraft: </strong>Without Lovecraft, there would be no Stephen King and certainly Martin's world may look a bit different. Lovecraft defined the genre of ""Cosmic Horror"" his stories suggested that there were deep terrors awaiting in the blackness of space or beneath the earth, hidden, but waiting. The sense of unease and dark things to come that Lovecraft's stories evoke was something I had fun recreating for Tadhya.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Marion Zimmer Bradley: </strong>Bradley's ""The Mists of Avalon"" which was a retelling of Arthurian Myths from the perspective of the women in the story, mainly Morgan Le Fay who in Bradley's book is called Morgaine. The Women of Avalon were a key influence on the Daughter of Hecate in Tadhya. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>L. Frank Baum &amp; Lewis Caroll: </strong>It all goes back to the childhood, as they say. Baum, who wrote ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" and Caroll who wrote, ""Alice's Adventure in Wonderland"" &amp; ""Through the Looking Glass"" both had a tremendous impact on me and on TADHYA.

So we’re definitely going to stick it to a bunch of your favorite classic/cult movies that <i>MAD</i> missed at the time.</p><p> </p><h2>Untied We Stand!</h2><p>By pledging, you are supporting every stage of this book’s creation, including upgraded spellchecking.  The corporate infrastructure that made these kinds of parodies possible is no longer available, so we have to do it ourselves.

The two of us have already planned the project in detail, while leaving room for personal input from you, our sponsors.  We’ve received quotes from our printer. And we’ve set a schedule. Our nearly dozens of fans know that we’ve both spent decades meeting strict deadlines on these kinds of features for <i>MAD</i>.  You can back us with confidence.</p><p><strong>This will work!</strong></p><p>Your contribution says that keeping this unique tradition alive means as much to you as it does to us. We’ll be grateful for your support. </p><p> </p><h2>Let's Hear from the Creators </h2><p><strong>Desmond Devlin</strong> says: </p><p>“Ours is a collaboration in the truest sense. I deliver page after astonishing page of incendiary satire, and Todd’s garish drawings make a serviceable distraction for the illiterate.”</p><p><strong>Tom Richmond</strong> says:  </p><p>“I’m excited to return to this unique art form, where I attempt to fit my eye-catching art and razor-sharp caricatures within the small amount of space left in each panel after three-quarters of it is filled with a lot of unnecessary words.

So just think: when you support our book project, you are guaranteed another $21 billion of entertainment. (Guarantee not guaranteed.) Who Are We?Artist Tom Richmond debuted in MAD in 2000, becoming its signature caricaturist in the years that followed, and is the winner of the National Cartoonists Society's prestigious 2011 Reuben Award for the year’s outstanding cartoonist. Writer Desmond Devlin wrote his first MAD article in 1984 when he was a teenager, became its most prolific writer during his 36-year tenure, and knows the winner of the prestigious 2011 Reuben Award.Over the years, these are just some of the many films and shows Desmond and Tom have teamed up to satirize:
“Harry Potter” 
“Breaking Bad” 
“Stranger Things” 
“Star Wars” 
“The Hunger Games” 
“The Dark Knight” 
“The Hobbit” 
The James Bond series
“Toy Story”
“The Big Bang Theory”
“The Sopranos” 
“The Avengers” 
Plus “The Wizard of Oz” and “A Christmas Story”!  
 And after twenty years, some felt we were THIS close to finally getting it right.   The Plan!We’re going to keep making parodies because we want to keep reading them, too! In fact, we’re going to make enough new movie parodies to fill a book. Our book! And if you contribute, your book!  The book is called CLAPTRAP !Every book has to begin somewhere. And so, the FIRST movie we’re going to parody is… “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.”  After four decades of “Star Wars” parodies, it would be a crime against humor for the last “Star Wars” movie to be the ONLY “Star Wars” movie not to get its own spoof. There’s a comedy hole at the end of the saga, and we’re going to fill it!Want to see what it’s called? Want to see how it starts?That's just a sneak peek of the splash page... there's 7 more story pages after that! How about another one?MAD never spoofed ""The Shawshank Redemption""?!? Nope. But now we have! Want to see another splash page sneak peek, mother?...What?!? Youse wanna see another sneak peek? Fuhgeddaboudit!You think we're funny? Funny how, exactly? Do we amuse you?Here's the full, wraparound cover!Hey, you’re ALREADY reading our book! And you haven’t pledged yet? What does this website look like, you cheap crumb bums, a public library? (Unless you’re from a public library that wants to buy a copy of our book, in which case God bless you for the selfless service you provide each and every day.) What Comes Next?The first volume of CLAPTRAP (how’s THAT for unwarranted confidence?) will contain twelve original, full, never-before-published movie parodies. On slightly larger paper! It will also include additional comedic material from Tom and Des! Over 100 color pages, sturdy hardcover format, decent spelling — you’re getting the whole shebang!For various reasons, many beloved films were never satirized when they originally came out. One of the best parodies we did together in MAD was of “A Christmas Story”… a mere 35 years after it appeared in theaters. It wasn’t a big hit then, but everybody knows it now. So we’re definitely going to stick it to a bunch of your favorite classic/cult movies that MAD missed at the time. Untied We Stand!By pledging, you are supporting every stage of this book’s creation, including upgraded spellchecking.  The corporate infrastructure that made these kinds of parodies possible is no longer available, so we have to do it ourselves. Which means we need help from yourselves!Just as importantly, you’re helping to keep the glorious parody format going, at a tough time for this kind of printed comedy.  Either way, you’re stuck with us— we’re the only game in town! Nobody is doing this anymore, except the two sentimental dummies who are talking to you now.Seriously, we’ve figured out how we can design and ship a really nice book to you. The two of us have already planned the project in detail, while leaving room for personal input from you, our sponsors.  We’ve received quotes from our printer. And we’ve set a schedule. Our nearly dozens of fans know that we’ve both spent decades meeting strict deadlines on these kinds of features for MAD.  You can back us with confidence.This will work!Your contribution says that keeping this unique tradition alive means as much to you as it does to us. We’ll be grateful for your support.  Let's Hear from the Creators Desmond Devlin says: “Ours is a collaboration in the truest sense. I deliver page after astonishing page of incendiary satire, and Todd’s garish drawings make a serviceable distraction for the illiterate.”Tom Richmond says:  “I’m excited to return to this unique art form, where I attempt to fit my eye-catching art and razor-sharp caricatures within the small amount of space left in each panel after three-quarters of it is filled with a lot of unnecessary words. Writer Darren Delvin never uses one word when three will do.""__________________________________________________UNLOCKED STRETCH GOALS:Our STRETCH MARKS...uh... GOALS, ALL UNLOCKED!!Stretch Goal #1: UNLOCKED!!THANKS EVERYBODY! Now ALL BACKERS from the ""Clod"" level up will receive a specialty CLAPTRAP  bookmark, designed in the Richmond style. Stick it in page 4 and think ahead to how much comedy lies ahead of you. Stick in in page 88, and think back on all the laughs you’ve had. Or stick it in your ear. It’s your bookmark, it’s your decision. Just don’t put it back in the book after it’s been in your ear. Yecch!Stretch Goal #2: UNLOCKED!!!WOW! Another furshlugginer stretch goal reached!!! THANKS EVERYBODY! Backers who’ve supported our top five tiers will be getting a unique sketch drawn into their books from Tom. Before YOU unlocked this stretch goal, it was Tom's choice of which character to draw. If Tom drew Chewbacca, but a Wookiee murdered your father, you'd just have to deal with the painful reminder. However, now that this goal is unlocked, all sketch backers will now get to choose exactly WHICH movie parody they want Tom to draw a character from!Stretch Goal #3: UNLOCKED!!!!YOU DID IT!! THANK YOU BACKERS!! Des and Tom will NOW write and draw an eleventh FULL movie parody for the book! Just for fun, Tom will write it and Des will draw it! On second thought...maybe that's not such a good idea. We'll announce WHICH movie it will be after the nomination and voting process on our 9th and 10th parody targets by our ""Doofus"" and higher backers. Thanks again, everybody!Stretch Goal #4: UNLOCKED!!!  Thank you backers! We are now going to ADD SIX PARODY MOVIE POSTERS to the book! These will NOT be posters for any of the movies we’re already spoofing, like “Psycho” or “Blade Runner” or “Toy Story 4.” They will be standalone productions in their own right.Stretch Goal #5: UNLOCKED!!!  That's IT! Our incredible furshlugginer backers have done it! Des and Tom will be adding a  12th AND FINAL EXTRA MOVIE PARODY in the book! AND our voting supporters will get their THIRD and LAST chance to choose which movie we do! Potrzebie!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who is Rainy Road?</h3>
<p>Beginning in 2013, while living in China, I decided to try one more shot at getting into the comic book biz. So I started the Rainy Road Comics/Media imprint and hired artists from around the world to help bring my various ideas to life.</p>
<p>The books were first published digitally with the hope of creating a supportive fanbase and with the intention of ultimately having print versions one day.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today and I currently have three physical books thanks to some tax return money and a few generous backers via Kickstarter. I still have a small amount of copies of each book available and have decided to offer the Indiegogo audience the chance to catch up on what they've been missing and to prepare for what's about to come.</p>
<p>Since the books are printed and ready to be shipped, they will be packed and shipped out the next business day. After your pledge is locked in, your book(s) will be mailed to you in a mylar bag inside of a Gemini mailer. <i>(Unless you order a bunch of stuff that won't fit inside a Gemini mailer. In that case, your order will come in other suitably sturdy packaging.)</i></p>
<h3>
<i><strong>NOTE:</strong></i> <i>The campaign must first reach the minimum goal of $500 before any items can start to be shipped out.  </i>
</h3>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What does ""a la carte"" mean?</h3>
<p>It means you can pick and choose from 3 awesome books (and some cool extras) that are <i><strong>already printed</strong></i> and have them shipped out to you as soon as your pledge has been locked. Get 1, 2 or the whole shebang! Get multiple copies! <strong><u><i>But note that quantities are very limited and once they're gone, they're gone. </i></u></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>All physical perks will include this special 6-page ashcan preview of Rainy Road's next big project, ""GunEngine Zero"", which will launch in spring, 2022.</i></h3>

<h3><i>Agents of S.H.H. #1  and #2 mini-comics with trading cards - $5.00 </i></h3>
<p>My 9-year-old daughter created, wrote and drew these 12-page mini-comics (with a little help from dear, old dad) that is in the tradition of children's adventure/humor books like Captain Underpants and Geronimo Stilton. It comes with <u><strong>1</strong></u> Pokemon-style trading card per book. <i><strong>The 2 cards in each picture is just to show the front and back of the card.</strong></i></p>
<p>As I've done in the past, we will match the total number of books sold and donate them to Comicbooks For Kids, which sends comics and other cool stuff to kids in hospitals and cancer centers. So, if you pledge for 2 copies, we will also send 2 copies to CB4K. You can also tell us if you'd rather have some or all of your pledged books sent to the charity instead. For example, you can pledge for 2 books and tell us to send you 1 copy and the other copy to the charity.</p>

Beginning in 2013, while living in China, I decided to try one more shot at getting into the comic book biz. So I started the Rainy Road Comics/Media imprint and hired artists from around the world to help bring my various ideas to life.
The books were first published digitally with the hope of creating a supportive fanbase and with the intention of ultimately having print versions one day.
Fast-forward to today and I currently have three physical books thanks to some tax return money and a few generous backers via Kickstarter. I still have a small amount of copies of each book available and have decided to offer the Indiegogo audience the chance to catch up on what they've been missing and to prepare for what's about to come.
Since the books are printed and ready to be shipped, they will be packed and shipped out the next business day. After your pledge is locked in, your book(s) will be mailed to you in a mylar bag inside of a Gemini mailer. (Unless you order a bunch of stuff that won't fit inside a Gemini mailer.

NOTE: The campaign must first reach the minimum goal of $500 before any items can start to be shipped out.  

 

What does ""a la carte"" mean?
It means you can pick and choose from 3 awesome books (and some cool extras) that are already printed and have them shipped out to you as soon as your pledge has been locked. Get 1, 2 or the whole shebang! Get multiple copies! But note that quantities are very limited and once they're gone, they're gone. 
 
All physical perks will include this special 6-page ashcan preview of Rainy Road's next big project, ""GunEngine Zero"", which will launch in spring, 2022.

 
 
THE BOOKS
PDFs of each book (except for Agents of S.H.H.) are available for backers that prefer digital or for international backers, since we'll only be shipping physical books to USA addresses. 
Each book is also available as an add-on with a base physical perk.

Some, if not all, of these characters could see their adventures continue in a future anthology or their own series.



 

 
Agents of S.H.H. #1  and #2 mini-comics with trading cards - $5.00 
My 9-year-old daughter created, wrote and drew these 12-page mini-comics (with a little help from dear, old dad) that is in the tradition of children's adventure/humor books like Captain Underpants and Geronimo Stilton. It comes with 1 Pokemon-style trading card per book. The 2 cards in each picture is just to show the front and back of the card.
As I've done in the past, we will match the total number of books sold and donate them to Comicbooks For Kids, which sends comics and other cool stuff to kids in hospitals and cancer centers. So, if you pledge for 2 copies, we will also send 2 copies to CB4K. You can also tell us if you'd rather have some or all of your pledged books sent to the charity instead. For example, you can pledge for 2 books and tell us to send you 1 copy and the other copy to the charity.
BOOK 1 - The Flower of Power



 
BOOK 2 - The Wheel of Light

<p><strong>Dig Two Graves</strong>, a comic book series created by Jim Tanner, is an action-adventure-drama throwback to classic revenge movies of the 70's and 80's with a modern twist. The series—planned for 12 issues of 40 full-color pages—follows Miranda Stone, a soldier who returns home from deployment, only to witness her husband and son gunned down in cold blood. In the wake of her tragedy, Miranda must put the pieces back together to find out who killed her family…and try not to get killed herself along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Dig Two Graves</strong> #2 picks up with the aftermath of the first issue's climactic shootout, diving deeper into the story of Arturo. With his biggest hurdle out of the way, he; along with his son, Max, and brother, Gonzalo—prepare to do everything necessary to see his plans come to fruition, even if it means further increasing the body count.</p>

<p>After a successful campaign for <strong>Dig Two Graves</strong> #2 on Kickstarter,  I had people reach out asking for a way to get a copy. We decided to try Indiegogo for people who missed out. We also decided to go with a graphic novel this time around, combining both <strong>Dig Two Graves</strong> #1 and #2 since this is our first time on Indiegogo.  That's over 80 pages of dark and gritty story telling. </p>
<p>Funds raised will go towards printing and fulfilment of <strong>Dig Two Graves</strong> graphic novel, as well as paying artists to collaborate on future projects.</p>

</div></div>","DIG TWO GRAVES, full-color trade paperback, combines book 1 and 2 bringing you over 80 pages of story.  Every backer also receives one 8.25""x11.5"" (A4) full-color glossy print.

Dig Two Graves, a comic book series created by Jim Tanner, is an action-adventure-drama throwback to classic revenge movies of the 70's and 80's with a modern twist. The series—planned for 12 issues of 40 full-color pages—follows Miranda Stone, a soldier who returns home from deployment, only to witness her husband and son gunned down in cold blood. In the wake of her tragedy, Miranda must put the pieces back together to find out who killed her family…and try not to get killed herself along the way.
Dig Two Graves #2 picks up with the aftermath of the first issue's climactic shootout, diving deeper into the story of Arturo. With his biggest hurdle out of the way, he; along with his son, Max, and brother, Gonzalo—prepare to do everything necessary to see his plans come to fruition, even if it means further increasing the body count.
 
WHAT ARE YOU BACKING?

This is a 84 full full-color trade paperback
Dark and gritty, revenge, action Noir.  Fans of Quentin Tarantino movies/Garth Ennis books or fans of gritty dark stories. 
Mature Readers

 



After a successful campaign for Dig Two Graves #2 on Kickstarter,  I had people reach out asking for a way to get a copy. We decided to try Indiegogo for people who missed out. We also decided to go with a graphic novel this time around, combining both Dig Two Graves #1 and #2 since this is our first time on Indiegogo.  That's over 80 pages of dark and gritty story telling. 
Funds raised will go towards printing and fulfilment of Dig Two Graves graphic novel, as well as paying artists to collaborate on future projects.

<p>For some it’s a sound effect, for me it’s a way of life! Comic books have been a part of my DNA since before I can remember. My favorite ones are those that embrace all of the things that make them uniquely COMICS: over-the-top action, beautiful idealized heroes, exaggerated situations, and really, really LOUD artwork. This is why I am insanely excited to be relaunching <strong>BLACK FLAG </strong>as a 48 page graphic novel! <strong>BLACK FLAG: PINEAPPLE PERCEPTION</strong> will be part one of a four part <strong>ODYSSEY</strong> that will take you into worlds, unimaginable.</p>
<p>My 30 year creative journey has brought me many opportunities as a comic book artist for <strong>MARVEL</strong>, <strong>DC</strong>, and<strong> IMAGE</strong>, as a storyboard artist for Blockbuster movies and TV shows, and as a director on <strong>THE RICKY GERVAIS SHOW</strong>, <strong>MONSTER HIGH</strong>, <strong>HOT WHEELS</strong>, and <strong>MAX STEEL</strong>. These  awesome experiences have helped build my artistic and storytelling  skill-sets to a place where I’m able to literally pull what’s in my head out and put it on paper for you to see! This brings me so much joy to be able to do this for you.</p>
<p><br/>I created <strong>BLACK FLAG</strong> in <strong>1994</strong>. It was my way to draw all of the things that make me happy: <strong>Absurdly large gun toting soldiers, sexy anime influenced ladies, magical multi-dimensional wizards, mega contorting aliens, super powered kids, and a giant Purple Gorilla!</strong> <i>Who could ask for more?!</i></p>

<h3><strong>Justice City Chronicles is an 80 page knock down, drag out,  butt-kicking adrenaline ride that is rooted in the action adventure cartoons of the 1980's.</strong></h3>
<p><br/>Volume one begins in the heart of the Etoran Republic, Justice City. We find our hero, Nero a prideful young cadet who is upon the precipice of graduating and becoming a member of the legendary Praetorian's like his father before him. The Praetorian's are an elite class of warriors tasked with keeping the peace throughout the realms. Nero's first mission as a Praetorian, to babysit a group of elite dignitaries on a routine diplomatic tour of the out-land regions quickly becomes a struggle of life and death when their Transport ship is attacked and shot down. What was once a routine mission now threatens to become the catalyst that will throw the world back into bloody war and at the center of it all is the Praetorian's  newest recruit Nero!</p>

I want to build my own universe and with your continued support, I'll be able to do just that! Thank you all for your support of my books. You make this possible!Andy1stMAN Volume 2! When The Fourth World Foundation creates a being of enormous power they need 1stMAN's help to rein in and contain the being known as Adonis! But things might not be as simple as 1stMAN is led to believe!Who is 1stMAN!They say with great power comes great responsibility... and a good time!!!Let’s face it— Luke Henry is loving being a superhero! Having inherited the powers of galactic champion A’pollo, hero of Kr’Atomm and imbued with the 10 Essences of Creation, Luke is hands down one of the most powerful men in the galaxy.A super-hero story that’s a little bit Spiderman, a little bit Captain Marvel (all of them, dude!), and a whole lot of wild-eyed, high-flying, epic outer space craziness, 1stMAN will remind you what it felt like to read a comic book printed on cheap newsprint, chewing on a wad of Topps baseball card bubble gum, and wondering what Penumbra looks like in a bikini! It’s that much fun!The StoryLuke Henry is the 1stMAN!Uniting with the galactic champion, A’pollo, and imbued with the 10 Essences, Luke was granted the power to help defeat the Dark One, Monarch and prevent the universe from falling under his evil dominion.Now Luke has decided to use his powers for the good of the earth, becoming its champion and protector, The 1stMAN!But his efforts have drawn the attention of The Fourth World Foundation, a team of scientists who are eager to understand Luke’s newfound powers and see if they can be applied to some of their own interests. But are they friend or foe, and who is the mysterious being, Adonis, who seems to understand Luke’s powers better than Luke does himself?Despite his great powers, Luke is still young and inexperienced. Let’s hope he keeps his guard up!At the end of 1stMAN volume 1, it was revealed that A’pollo survived the battle against the evil Monarch by merging his soul with the Dark One, and he and his love Penumbra returned to their home in the High Science City on Kr’Atomm’s second moon, Delphis, to resume their lives as Kr’Atomm’s top scientists and heroes.But it’s beginning to appear that Penumbra hasn’t fully resigned herself to her husband’s new appearance, riding shotgun in Monarch’s physical aspect. And what are these strange sensations stirring within A’pollo’s being? Could it be that the dark one Monarch was not completely destroyed after all? Does A’pollo still harbor vestiges of the evil being within him?The second volume of 1stMAN continues the adventures of Earth’s newest and greatest hero! Reserve your copy today!

But, after some time, a friend told me ""Man, that girl you draw is different from the other characters. 'She has your passion"", and that was true, I created Leona in a time that I was kinda depressed, and did put all my feelings in drawings. That's impressive, every time I work on a new story of her I am living some sort of intense moment of my life, or some kind of transition. After that, I decided to study about the culture of  Witches, Celtics, Vikings, Ancient Egypt/Greece, Tarot, Myths from Eastern Europe, the history itself since the Victorian ages until the Industrial Revolution, etc. For years, the classic horror books were my favorite readings, such as Dracula, Frankenstein, and Lovecraft. All of those references gave me the basis for Leona's tales, (the name being a direct reference for Leon - The Professional, that's why Leona has a lil' zombie girl apprentice - Karmen) and then created the ""Midnight  Witch"" series.</p><p> </p><h3>LEONA STARTS HERE / LEONA COMEÇA AQUI</h3><p>After a cataclysm event that happened during the initiation ritual of young Leona - a ceremony where she graduated from apprentice to witch - the timeline was broken thanks to a massive discharge of time energy. That cataclysm happened due to the presence of an anomaly that brought a great disturbance to Lux Magicae. That anomaly happened to be Leona herself. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622461930/e11jocwlyutel3blaqyi.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>While her dimension's inhabitants turned into stone, time has stopped in her own reality and Leona is forced to travel through space and time, not staying in any dimension for more than a day. At midnight, she is always transported to a new place. </p><p>According to old tales told by the Temporum Era, the first cataclysm was stopped thanks to the huge power of the first Time Lady. Because of that, the First Time Lady decides to transmit her knowledge to a group of women chosen by her in every dimension she visits. Those women's mission is to avoid a new cataclysm, contain the Time Flow and redirect it to it's original destination. </p><p> </p><p>After the second cataclysm in Lux Magicae, only two women survived (i.e. weren't turned into stone): Leona and her mother, Nastia. Both are absorbed by time and space, being the only ones capable of restoring the timeline in their own dimension.

</div></div>","Racconti del Poeta: una selezione di tredici racconti dell'orrore e del grottesco, scritti dal maesto Edgar Allan Poe ed illustrati da talentuosi artisti italiani.

In copertina: ""Il gatto nero"", di Lisa Pagnutti
Il progetto nasce dalla passione dei curatori Anita Zaramella e studiopazzia per l’opera di Poe e il media fumetto, creandone un punto d’incontro, e riunisce disegnatori con i più diversi background, dai veterani dell'indie a professionisti affermati. 

Da sinistra: ""La maschera della morte rossa"", di Silvia Schiavon; ""Ligeia"", di Matteo Batetta; ""Il genio della perversione"", di Giacomo Taddeo Traini; ""I delitti della Rue Morgue"", di Marco Rocchi.
Il volume conta 124 pagine in bianco e nero, in cui i nostri artisti si sono cimentati in adattamenti fedeli di racconti di Edgar Allan Poe, dall'horror al grottesco, passando per i più sperimentali. All'interno trovate il lavoro di: Anita Zaramella, studiopazzia, Ada Visser, Antonio de Fabris, Federica Perin, Giacomo Traini, Lisa Pagnutti, Marco Rocchi, Matteo Batetta, Mattia Modde, Nas Kirchmayr e Gianluca Girelli, Riccardo Pieruccini, Silvia Schiavon. 
Con introduzione di Angela Viola Borzacchiello.

""Hop-Frog"", di Riccardo Pieruccini

""Il dialogo di Eiros e Charmion"", di Federica Perin
 

""Una discesa nel Maelstorm"", di Antonio de Fabris
 

""Berenice"", di Anita Zaramella
Inoltre, in occasione della campagna, abbiamo l'occasione di offrirvi delle stampe in edizione limitata realizzati da artisti d'eccezione: Stefano Zattera, sarabaun, Beatrice Bogoni e Fabio Babich!
Leggete i perks fino in fondo per una sorpresa ;)
""Il barile di Amontillado"", di Stefano Zattera

""Il Corvo"", di sarabaun

""Metzengerstein"", di Beatrice Bogoni

""La caduta della casa degli Usher"", di Fabio Babich
Il fumetto italiano ha una lunga tradizione di adattamenti letterari a fumetti, sia per ragazzi che per adulti, che da sempre hanno l’obiettivo di legare due mondi: rendere la letteratura accessibile, sfondando il preconcetto della noia, e sfruttare le variegate potenzialità del media. In questo senso, riteniamo che l’opera di Poe sia un soggetto perfetto, e che possa guadagnare in intensità dall’apporto artistico che intendiamo aggiungere.
I racconti che troverete in Racconti del Poeta sono: Berenice, Ligeia, Il Ritratto Ovale, Hop-Frog, Il Diavolo nel Campanile, Re Peste, Il genio della perversione, Una discesa nel Maelstorm, Il dialogo tra Eiros e Charmion, Il silenzio (a fumetti, o in forma di racconto illustrato); La Maschera della Morte Rossa, I delitti della Rue Morgue, Il Cuore Rivelatore, e Il gatto nero (come illustrazioni singole all'interno del libro).Le stampe raccontano invece: Il Corvo, Il barile di Amontillado, La caduta della casa degli Usher, e Metzengerstein.

<p>Stump's story continues in this second issue of what will hopefully be an ongoing series of comic books.  To do that I will need your help to get this book funded.  The reaction to Stump #1: Remastered was very positive and I can't wait for you to read Stump's next adventure!</p>

<p><strong>Who is Stump?</strong></p>
<p>Before we get too far into the details of Stump #2, I think it's important to explain what my vision is for Stump as a character.  The easiest way for me to describe him is that he's a working-class, ""blue collar"" superhero.  Which simply means that he works his butt off everyday to do the right thing and help others, without worrying about fame or glory.  This doesn't mean that he does not make mistakes or have personality shortcomings that might interfere with his goals, but his default attitude is to put the needs of others before any dreams or ambitions he might have.</p>
<p>A key event from Stump's past (parts of which were shown in flashback form, in Stump #1) will be the primary motivating factor for where Stump is going as a superhero (although he is not at all comfortable using that term to describe himself).</p>
<p>Most of the story in issues #1 and #2 takes place in a rural, ""flyover country"", small town environment.  For the foreseeable future, the town of Hillsboro, Illinois, will be Stump's primary base of operations.  I've never been happy with how small towns are traditionally depicted in entertainment and I hope to change that in some small way with my stories.</p>
<p><strong>Anyway, back to Stump #2:</strong></p>
<p>The first page of Stump #2 picks up only a few hours after the final page of Stump #1.  Loose plot threads from the first issue will be developed further and Stump will be forced to confront a new threat created by magical forces that he has never encountered before.</p>
<p>My goal is to create a book that can be picked up and read immediately after you finish Stump #1: Remastered, but also a comic book that presents a satisfying story for new readers as well.  Even if you've never read issue #1, I hope to create a story that you can still enjoy in Stump #2.</p>

<p><strong>HERE'S THE STORY: </strong></p>
<p>It's 2030, a virus ""The Red Death"" originating in England kills 10's of millions, fearing a global outbreak England is abandoned left to rot by the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Two corporations use the chaos to try and seize control of the country. One of these corporations (Globe) creates supes/mutants, the other (BlackGate) uses superior military technology/mechs.</p>
<p>What ensues is an all-out war between Mutants vs Machines, no one is safe.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">--WHAT IS REPLICATOR?--</h2>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<p>REPLICATOR is incredible. It is a fast-paced, action sci-fi comic, with Supes, Mechs and Super Soldiers set in a diseased ravaged England.</p>
<p>It's like The Boys mixed with Ghost in the Shell and Gundam, sprinkled with a little contagion and that doesn't even sum it all up.</p>
<p>Corporations are looking to take over...and human life is just an afterthought.</p>
<p>Replicator cuts out all the bullshit. There are no characters standing around a water fountain talking, there is tons of intense action, and characters who will make you love them because they are so deliciously evil.</p>

</div></div>","REPLICATOR #3 is a 32-PAGE FULL COLOUR comic book in the ongoing Replicator series.
REPLICATOR #1 and #2 are also available during this campaign combining for a total of 88 pages!
When a virus kills millions, one scientist (Sarah) discovers a potential cure however she goes missing in unusual circumstances and her husband (Ryker) is forced down a path that will change him forever.
But you'd do anything to save the ones you love, wouldn't you? Anything?
 
KYLE RITTER-ROB WILLIS COVER

 
HERE'S THE STORY: 
It's 2030, a virus ""The Red Death"" originating in England kills 10's of millions, fearing a global outbreak England is abandoned left to rot by the rest of the world.
Two corporations use the chaos to try and seize control of the country. One of these corporations (Globe) creates supes/mutants, the other (BlackGate) uses superior military technology/mechs.
What ensues is an all-out war between Mutants vs Machines, no one is safe.
 





 
--WHAT IS REPLICATOR?--

 
REPLICATOR is incredible. It is a fast-paced, action sci-fi comic, with Supes, Mechs and Super Soldiers set in a diseased ravaged England.
It's like The Boys mixed with Ghost in the Shell and Gundam, sprinkled with a little contagion and that doesn't even sum it all up.
Corporations are looking to take over...and human life is just an afterthought.
Replicator cuts out all the bullshit. There are no characters standing around a water fountain talking, there is tons of intense action, and characters who will make you love them because they are so deliciously evil.

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Michael Finn and along with comic creators <strong>Ron Frenz</strong> and <strong>Barry Kitson</strong> (our pencilers), <strong>Mark Waid</strong> (our editor) and a host of other comic creators, we are making an original 100+ page graphic novel in full color featuring dozens of super-heroes and villains from Comic's Golden Age, the 1940s and 1950s.    </p>
<p>The story takes place in the middle of World War II.  Hitler, advised by Misery, the Claw and others, has hatched a plan to assassinate President Roosevelt using the combined power of some of the biggest villains of the past, including the Clown, Mastermind, the Rat, the Scarlet Skull and the saboteur, Frost.  The only thing standing in Hitler's way is <strong>The Liberty Brigade</strong>, a team comprised of the Blue Flame, Cat-Man, Kitten, the Mad Hatter, the Green Turtle and three brand new heroes:  Mr. Freedom, the Bill of Rights and the National Anthem. </p>
<p>There are cameos by dozens of heroes from the 1940s, including well-known heroes such as The Black Terror and lesser-known stars such as TNT Todd, the Spark Man and Mirror Man.  The same for villains as you'll find Professor Fenton, the Green Ghoul, the Cobra and Veda the Cobra Woman.  </p>
<p>In addition to the 80+ page main story, we have over 20 one-page origins of various heroes and villains of the Golden Age by a host of comic book superstars including  <strong>George Perez</strong>, <strong>Alan Davis</strong>, <strong>Mark Buckingham</strong>, <strong>John Totleben</strong>,  <strong>Rick Veitch</strong>, <strong>Barry Kitson</strong>, <strong>Jim Calafiore</strong>, <strong>Chris Weston</strong>, <strong>Ken Lashley</strong>, <strong>Ron Wilson</strong>, <strong>Mark Morales</strong>, <strong>Al Milgrom</strong>, and many more.  </p>
<p>We are also offering <strong>The Liberty Brigade Sourcebook</strong> comic in conjunction with Temporal Comics -- this comic book contains encyclopedia entries on many of the key characters in The Liberty Brigade graphic novel.</p>

Instead, the characters involved will be chasing and confronting their own personal demons.</p><p><strong>STORY SUMMARY</strong></p><p>Matthew in many ways seeking seeking redemption. He wants to move on from his days as a crooked cop, but has had no luck. The community sees him as a criminal. He works at a minimum wage job, his girlfriend's parents hate him, and to top it off he is about to get evicted! How long will it take for Matthew to finally break and go to a more beneficial life of crime?</p><p><strong>WHY THIS STORY?</strong></p><p>I believe in many ways Chasing Demons is different from most things coming out, anyone could say that, so hopefully you take my word for it. Since this is a mini series, we are firing on all cylinders, that means we are holding nothing back! Despite this being a prequel to my Stryde mini series, it is also a perfect jumping on point for new readers. Even if you aren't sold on the story, the art alone by Pradeep Sethi will make your purchase worthwhile.</p><p><strong>CHARACTERS</strong></p><p><strong>Matthew Foster AKA Cobalt</strong> is the main character of this comic, he was a character who appeared in Stryde. I noticed early on that Matthew had a lot of potential to carry his own story. The city hails him a hero, but the tragic fact is he's conning them all. He fights crime mainly for his benefit, as he steals drug money and takes out any illegal competition. Denver is better with Cobalt, but the cost is a lie.</p><p><strong>Maximo AKA Marrow</strong> is the main antagonist of this comic, my goal was to make him a compelling villain and I believe I have achieved that. Marrow runs Hell's Cradle, a casino catered to criminals. Maximo will endure family problems all while having to deal with Cobalt.</p><p><strong>Tessa Flowers</strong> is the love interest to Matthew. Without this character, the story has no legs to stand on.

Instead, the characters involved will be chasing and confronting their own personal demons.STORY SUMMARYMatthew in many ways seeking seeking redemption. He wants to move on from his days as a crooked cop, but has had no luck. The community sees him as a criminal. He works at a minimum wage job, his girlfriend's parents hate him, and to top it off he is about to get evicted! How long will it take for Matthew to finally break and go to a more beneficial life of crime?WHY THIS STORY?I believe in many ways Chasing Demons is different from most things coming out, anyone could say that, so hopefully you take my word for it. Since this is a mini series, we are firing on all cylinders, that means we are holding nothing back! Despite this being a prequel to my Stryde mini series, it is also a perfect jumping on point for new readers. Even if you aren't sold on the story, the art alone by Pradeep Sethi will make your purchase worthwhile.CHARACTERSMatthew Foster AKA Cobalt is the main character of this comic, he was a character who appeared in Stryde. I noticed early on that Matthew had a lot of potential to carry his own story. The city hails him a hero, but the tragic fact is he's conning them all. He fights crime mainly for his benefit, as he steals drug money and takes out any illegal competition. Denver is better with Cobalt, but the cost is a lie.Maximo AKA Marrow is the main antagonist of this comic, my goal was to make him a compelling villain and I believe I have achieved that. Marrow runs Hell's Cradle, a casino catered to criminals. Maximo will endure family problems all while having to deal with Cobalt.Tessa Flowers is the love interest to Matthew. Without this character, the story has no legs to stand on. Tessa has known Matthew for awhile now and has accepted his darker side, although she is hopeful his better side will prevail.RISKSPeople are understandably nervous to back a campaign, but I can assure you this will get done as I have many campaigns under my belt. I managed to release the entirety of my Stryde mini series and that was when I had zero experience. I cannot do it alone, I was blessed to have backers support me and I will need that to finish out this book.THANK YOUWhether you back the comic or not, thank you for taking the time to check out my campaign!THE TEAMWriter: Thomas RetzkeMain Artist: Pradeep SethiArtist: Jordan Beattie Editor: MABLetterer: Drew DenisTHE ART",2.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>Hello, everyone! We're back with another campaign. First, we want to thank all our previous supporters.  If you are new to us, we appreciate you taking the time to look at our campaign.</p>
<p>We are attempting to do something different this time. As many of you know, Fred Perry has produced close to 300 issues of his groundbreaking series, <i>Gold Digger</i>. Over the years, we have reprinted his creation in a series of ""Bricks"" which are collections of his series in 25-issue increments. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629382848/ksdphjocereccfuar4wc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Some of the earlier Bricks we have printed in the past have long gone out of print. Two of those editions are <i>GOLD BRICK</i>S <i>V</i> and <i>VI</i> (a.k.a. Color Bricks 3 and 4), which reprint issues #51 to #75 in <i>Brick V</i> and issues #76 to #100 in <i>Brick VI</i>. These Bricks also have NEVER been reprinted in the newer format, so now we are going to offer BOTH Bricks at the same time. </p>
<p>So to emphasize....</p>
<p><i>COLOR GOLD BRICK 3</i> (<i>Gold Brick V</i>) REPRINTS <i>Gold Digger</i> issues #51 to #75</p>
<p><i>COLOR GOLD BRICK 4</i> (<i>Gold Brick VI</i>) REPRINTS <i>Gold Digger</i> issues #76 to #100</p> <p> If you supported the previous color <i>Gold Brick</i>s, thank you very much, and we hope you support this campaign too. With a load of great standalone and continuity pickup stories, this collection makes a great jumping-on point for any new readers, as well as awesome reading for longtime fans.  Between its black-and-white and full-color issues, <i>Gold Digger</i> is fast approaching the 300-issue mark and is going strong!</p>

<p>Cover to <i>GOLD BRICK VI</i> / <i>Color Brick 4</i></p> <p>If you're not familiar with us, my name is Joeming Dunn, and I run Antarctic Press, a small, independent comic company started in 1984. I have personally collected comics of almost every type and genre since 1974, and I can say that during the past 30 years, we have published some of the greatest and best independent comics out there. Our publishing history includes titles like <i>Gold Digger</i> and <i>Ninja High School</i>. The comic industry has changed over the years, so we have started this campaign to help introduce new projects from our talented group of creators.</p> <p>Over the years, we have published a number of series. Prominent among these is Fred Perry's ingenious title, <i>Gold Digger</i>, which Fred describes as a mixture of <i>Indiana Jones</i> and <i>Final Fantasy</i>. The idea for <i>Gold Digger</i> was first conceived during Fred's tour of duty in the first Gulf War, and it debuted in Antarctic Press's anthology comic, <i>Mangazine</i>, in 1991. A four-issue miniseries followed in 1992, and a regular monthly black-and-white series followed starting in 1993. The current color series began in 1999 and has continued since then. It is the second-longest-running solo-created title in the industry. In 2013, Fred was honored at Comic Con International in San Diego, where he received an Inkpot Award for his work on <i>Gold Digger</i>.</p> <p>Over the past years, we have released other <i>Color Gold Bricks</i> as crowdfunding projects. We are now reprinting the fifth and sixth <i>Gold Brick</i>s as <i>Color Gold Brick 3</i> and <i>4</i>, which feature <i>Gold Digger </i>series issues 51 to 75 and 76 to 100, respectively.  If you haven't seen or read <i>Gold Digger</i>, this is your chance to enjoy one of the best and longest-running ongoing series in comics. Like the other Bricks, these let new readers join in easily, so you don't have to be shy!</p> <p>The run of <i>Gold Digger</i> has been printed in ten <i>Gold Brick</i>s to date. The earliest volumes, <i>Gold Brick 1</i> and <i>Gold Brick 2</i>, were black and white. Then Fred began his color series, so Bricks 3-6 were printed in color. <i>Gold Brick 3</i> was originally printed in limited quantities, and Fred's only reference copy became thoroughly destroyed from years of constant use. Crowdfunding was used to make this out-of-print edition available again as <i>Color Brick 1</i>.  Now the original stock of <i>Brick</i>s <i>5</i> and <i>6</i> have sold out, so we are offering new printings of them through this campaign, sized to match the current format. (We know this can still be confusing, so we have a numbering guide at the bottom of this page.)</p> <p>We have promised before that would reprint the other volumes to match the new crowdfunded printings' format. We want everyone to have nice editions. In addition to reasons already mentioned, during previous campaigns, many backers have asked if we could skip ahead, since they had already purchased the earlier editions. Skipping ahead allows these backers to have a nice, new volume for their shelves. At the same time, we also help backers who missed the earlier Brick offerings way back in the day to catch up via the reprints.</p>
<p>Here are the cover galleries for each Brick:</p>

<p>Plain and simple, we're going to print and ship the <i>Gold Digger Color Gold Brick 3</i> and <i>4</i>. Each of the <i>Color Gold Brick</i>s is over 600 pages in FULL COLOR. Printing the actual books is the biggest single expense. The first print run of a typical <i>Gold Brick</i> is quite costly, as most printers require a minimum run to make it cost-effective. We are thus using Indiegogo to assist us with those costs. If the amount seems high, you must remember that we are printing at least a thousand copies of a 600+ page book. Another cost is shipping: First we will have to ship the books from the printer to our offices, and once we get them, send copies to all our supporters and distributors. Several thousand pounds of books represents a significant shipping expense.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of our expenses.</p>
<p>Printing...This includes hard and softcover editions of both volumes.</p>
<p>Shipping...Sending a 600-page book is costly, especially overseas.  The cost for shipping just one copy overseas is unfortunately substantial.</p>
<p>Fees...Indiegogo takes their fees off the top</p>
<p>Handling/Supplies....We have to pay for boxes and pay people to pack those boxes.  This also include costs for sending the large PDF files to all the supporters and other miscellaneous costs.</p>

<p>Here are the rewards we are offering.  Some of you may ask why there are not any sketch editions available with these rewards as in previous campaigns.

<p>We hope to print other <i>Gold Brick</i>s, both earlier ones as they sell out and new ones never before collected. As you know, these volume together will reprint 50 issues of the color series, but there are close to 300 issues of <i>Gold Digger</i>, and this printing of 1200+ pages only covers a little under 20% of the entire run. Many of the early issues are the ones that are most desperately out of print. Being a small, independent publisher, we are forced to try to keep our cost margins as narrow as possible, and the end result is many of our books sell out quickly and become unavailable. Hopefully, we can use Indiegogo to help us keep all of our books in print. This is especially important with <i>Gold Digger</i>, since new readers discover the comic every day. We hope to be able to include other items as push goals, which may include getting other Bricks out to you.</p>
<p>NUMBERING GUIDE</p>
<p> Gold Brick #1 (B/W #1) - The first Gold Brick, which collects the first 25 issues of the black-and-white regular series. (Not offered on Indiegogo.)</p>
<p> Gold Brick #2 (B/W #2) - The second Gold Brick, which collects issues #26 – 50 of the black-and-white regular series. (Not offered on Indiegogo.)</p>
<p> Gold Brick #3 (COLOR BRICK #1) - The third Gold Brick, the first to collect the COLOR Gold Digger series issues #1 – 25. (New Printing crowdfunded on January 1, 2014.)</p>
<p> Gold Brick #4 (COLOR BRICK #2) - The fourth Gold Brick, but the second to collect the COLOR Gold Digger series, containing issues #26 – 50. (New Printing crowdfunded on May 16, 2014.)</p>
<p> Gold Brick #5 (COLOR BRICK #3) The fifth Gold Brick, collects issues #51 – #75 of the COLOR Gold Digger series. COLLECTED IN THE NEW FORMAT IN THIS CAMPAIGN.</p>
<p> Gold Brick #6 (COLOR BRICK #4) The sixth Gold Brick, collects issues #76 – #100 of the COLOR Gold Digger series. COLLECTED IN THE NEW FORMAT IN THIS CAMPAIGN.</p>
<p> Gold Brick #7 (COLOR BRICK #5) The seventh Gold Brick, collects issues #101 – #125 of the COLOR Gold Digger series. (First Printing! Crowdfunding project ended on December 12, 2014.)</p>
<p> Gold Brick #8 (COLOR BRICK #6) The eighth Gold Brick, collects issues #126 – #150 of the COLOR Gold Digger series. As of color issue #150, we integrated the 50 black-and-white issues into the numbering to emphasize Fred's landmark achievement.  The 150th color issue was therefore published as Gold Digger #200, and the issue numbering proceeds from that point. (First Printing! Crowdfunding project ended on August 2, 2016.)</p>
<p> GOLD BRICK #9 (COLOR BRICK #7) The ninth Gold Brick, collects issues #201- #225. (First Printing! Crowdfunded on May 15, 2017.)</p>
<p> GOLD BRICK #10 (COLR BRICK #8) The tenth Gold Brick, collects issues #226-#250. (First Printing! Crowdfunded on March 5, 2021.)</p> <p>Gold Digger Publication History</p>
<p>In the beginning, there was an issue of <i>Mangazine</i>, which introduced <i>Gold Digger</i> to the world, and the issue was good. Then there was a 4-issue miniseries that got this joint a-poppin'. Lo, there came the regular <i>Gold Digger</i> (black and white) issues #1-50. Then, when Mankind was ready and their fingers grew tired of newsprint stains, <i>Gold Digger</i> (color) issues #1-149 on the glossy paper. Many years passed while reading those amazing issues, and the world was ready for re-numberification. There shall be a number, and the number shall be #150—NO, wait! it shall be... #200, and all the <i>Gold Digger</i> numbering was reintegrated. 50+150=200. And the world rejoiced, and the numbering has continued thus ever since! (So, why didn't we include the 4-issue miniseries in the reintegrated numbering? Ugh! Don't ask.)</p>
</div></div>","Hello, everyone! We're back with another campaign. First, we want to thank all our previous supporters.  If you are new to us, we appreciate you taking the time to look at our campaign.
We are attempting to do something different this time. As many of you know, Fred Perry has produced close to 300 issues of his groundbreaking series, Gold Digger. Over the years, we have reprinted his creation in a series of ""Bricks"" which are collections of his series in 25-issue increments. 

Some of the earlier Bricks we have printed in the past have long gone out of print. Two of those editions are GOLD BRICKS V and VI (a.k.a. Color Bricks 3 and 4), which reprint issues #51 to #75 in Brick V and issues #76 to #100 in Brick VI. These Bricks also have NEVER been reprinted in the newer format, so now we are going to offer BOTH Bricks at the same time. 
So to emphasize....
COLOR GOLD BRICK 3 (Gold Brick V) REPRINTS Gold Digger issues #51 to #75
COLOR GOLD BRICK 4 (Gold Brick VI) REPRINTS Gold Digger issues #76 to #100  If you supported the previous color Gold Bricks, thank you very much, and we hope you support this campaign too. With a load of great standalone and continuity pickup stories, this collection makes a great jumping-on point for any new readers, as well as awesome reading for longtime fans.  Between its black-and-white and full-color issues, Gold Digger is fast approaching the 300-issue mark and is going strong!

Cover to GOLD BRICK V / Color Brick 3

Cover to GOLD BRICK VI / Color Brick 4 If you're not familiar with us, my name is Joeming Dunn, and I run Antarctic Press, a small, independent comic company started in 1984. I have personally collected comics of almost every type and genre since 1974, and I can say that during the past 30 years, we have published some of the greatest and best independent comics out there. Our publishing history includes titles like Gold Digger and Ninja High School. The comic industry has changed over the years, so we have started this campaign to help introduce new projects from our talented group of creators. Over the years, we have published a number of series.

A four-issue miniseries followed in 1992, and a regular monthly black-and-white series followed starting in 1993. The current color series began in 1999 and has continued since then. It is the second-longest-running solo-created title in the industry. In 2013, Fred was honored at Comic Con International in San Diego, where he received an Inkpot Award for his work on Gold Digger. Over the past years, we have released other Color Gold Bricks as crowdfunding projects. We are now reprinting the fifth and sixth Gold Bricks as Color Gold Brick 3 and 4, which feature Gold Digger series issues 51 to 75 and 76 to 100, respectively.  If you haven't seen or read Gold Digger, this is your chance to enjoy one of the best and longest-running ongoing series in comics.

<h3>Welcome to EARTHBOUND</h3>
<p>Earthbound was a stand-out graphic novel from the Comicsgate indie-circuit in 2019, it SOLD OUT after a groundswell of positive grassroots reviews from readers.  Many claimed it was their favorite book of the year. </p>
<p>Now we are back with PART 2, the epic conclusion to the tale of Wiz Kid, Julia, and Spaceman.</p>
<p>This time around expect two things: ACTION and ANSWERS!</p>
<p>Julia and Spaceman are headhunters sent to Earth to recruit 4 deadly warriors, The Sirens of Violence.  The mission is a competition, who can recruit more for their employer, The 13th Sponsor.  Should the competition end in a tie, a 5th target has been declared: an estranged teammate of Julia and Spaceman's, WIZ KID.</p>
<p>Now in Part 2, the mission moves unrelentingly towards a clash with the Sirens.  The only way you can survive against a Siren is if you have another Siren right there to protect you, so the recruitment technology of the R-Types, special weaponry given to Spaceman and Julian by the 13th Sponsor, becomes especially imperative.</p>
<p>Part 2 will COMPLETELY WRAP UP THIS ARC of Earthbound.</p>

</div></div>","Welcome to EARTHBOUND
Earthbound was a stand-out graphic novel from the Comicsgate indie-circuit in 2019, it SOLD OUT after a groundswell of positive grassroots reviews from readers.  Many claimed it was their favorite book of the year. 
Now we are back with PART 2, the epic conclusion to the tale of Wiz Kid, Julia, and Spaceman.
This time around expect two things: ACTION and ANSWERS!
Julia and Spaceman are headhunters sent to Earth to recruit 4 deadly warriors, The Sirens of Violence.  The mission is a competition, who can recruit more for their employer, The 13th Sponsor.  Should the competition end in a tie, a 5th target has been declared: an estranged teammate of Julia and Spaceman's, WIZ KID.
Now in Part 2, the mission moves unrelentingly towards a clash with the Sirens.  The only way you can survive against a Siren is if you have another Siren right there to protect you, so the recruitment technology of the R-Types, special weaponry given to Spaceman and Julian by the 13th Sponsor, becomes especially imperative.
Part 2 will COMPLETELY WRAP UP THIS ARC of Earthbound.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Greetings fellow humans, My name is Eli, and I make comics and board games, although this time I’m talking about my comics. I have been making comics since 2008, and actually publishing them since 2016, and today I’m here to show you the continuation of one of my very first stories Alien 101.</p>
<p>Alien 101 Is a romantic comedy, a sci-fi comic about an alien in Highschool trying to understand human love, and depending on his report he could save the world (probably). This campaign is to help me bring this comic into the hands of the future as well as some long-time fans. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Because the book is already done, funds from this campaign will go straight into printing shipping and goodies. Every backer will receive exclusive alt art cards of characters from this comic for my game Scattered Nexus, Even if you never play the game, the art is super cute and collectible.  I would usually only sell these at conventions in person, but I like you guys. books will be printing from “Kablam” printing and cards will be coming from “Drive-thru cards”. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1633542049/j0jjdolpo3metiqg4gqt.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>This comic is about an alien in high school trying to understand what human love is. And it's based on my experience when I was in Highschool, and the years after that when I actually figured out about love myself. This story is about the lessons I learned and what I wish I knew back then, as well as some jokes that I think are funny. I think this Is a great story for teens, adults, and anyone navigating the turbulent seas of love.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The companies and services I’m using are designed to make this project as smooth as possible. Aside from these companies exploding, It should be fine. The books are already done and edited, the printers are in the US, and I’m only releasing them to the US. If something does go wrong with the printing I’d just have to use a different printer, I even have a few in mind. </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you cant support me financially just checking out my work on social media is a great help <a href=""https://linktr.ee/elibeaird"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://linktr.ee/elibeaird</a> .</p>
<p>I am creating content on Webtoons, Facebook, and youtube. Even if you don't like my content I’m sure you have a friend that would love it, so just share this campaign with them to show them that you care. I am going to be making content, comics, and games for years, and I’d love to share my stories with more people, that's why I do it, and I feel like now is the perfect time to share our stories with each other. </p>

<h2>What is this story about?</h2>
<p>If Frankenstein meets the Civil War wasn't enough to grab your attention, here's a brief breakdown of the story...</p>
<p>In the final months of the American Civil war, a secret Confederate Plot is unfolding. Desperate to turn the tide toward their favor, the Confederates have pursued a ghastly ghost story as a last resort. A horrific tale about a mad scientist who is believed to have brought a hideous dead monster back to life! Strangely enough, this foreign fairy tale has proved to be much more fact than fiction.</p>

<p>As the rebels put their final plans into action, a reconstructive surgeon named Dr. Daniel Schmidt rebuilds their broken soldiers. All the while living with bone chilling secrets of his own. For all his charm and brilliance, Daniel hides a monstrous past.

<p>I know, Ned was surprised too. Even more surprising for him was the news that the <strong>Infernal Dimension</strong> is a big part of his family's legacy. And since finding out that he's next in line to rule his father's <strong>Hellpit</strong>... Let's just say life's gotten interesting. Seeing <strong>demons</strong>. A <strong>zombie</strong> and a couch-potato demon for roommates. Bickering, <strong>murderous angels</strong> on his scent. Nosy NYPD <strong>detectives</strong>. And a plot to <strong>wipe out</strong> his whole family.</p>
<p>Oh, for the bliss of ignorance.</p>
<p>Now Ned's got to find a way out of this inheritance before the dark forces aligning against him give him a way out... <strong>PERMANENTLY</strong></p>

<p>This is VOLUME TWO of Ned's story. (If you missed the first volume, don't worry; there's a single combined perk for both Volume One &amp; Two. Or if you'd like to add Vol One for any of the other levels, it's available as an add-on.) As in Volume One, it's a supernatural fish-out-of-water comedy, Ned's dealing with being the new heir-apparent to his father's section in Hell, a Pit ruled by his family for generations.  Not that he's a bad son, but seeing  -and being attacked by-  demons, accidentally creating a zombie roommate, getting on the wrong side of suspicious police, and dealing with Cherubim out for blood just isn't the family life he had hoped for. And it all happened so fast that Ned barely had time to think. In this second part of the story, enough’s enough and he's taking back control of his life. He's going to find a way out of this inheritance... before it gets him killed.</p>

<p>The story runs almost 160 pages, and completes the first major story arc began in NLoP Vol 1. If I have room, there'll be extras: Behind the scenes stuff; guest pin-ups; a THANK YOU page to you the collectors. But the story is the important thing, and it almost fills the book now. The page count is not set in stone. The great thing about creator-owned and Indiegogo: No constraints. It's all my vision.</p>

Judd Winnick's <strong>EXILES</strong>. <strong>GOTHAM UNDERGROUND</strong> with Frank Tieri. <strong>RED LANTERNS</strong> with Charles Soule. <strong>SECRET SIX </strong>and <strong>LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS</strong> with Gail Simone. I love comics. And because of collectors like you, I'm doing my own comics, my way. It's so much more fun, and I thank you.</p>

</div></div>","So, Hell exists.

I know, Ned was surprised too. Even more surprising for him was the news that the Infernal Dimension is a big part of his family's legacy. And since finding out that he's next in line to rule his father's Hellpit... Let's just say life's gotten interesting. Seeing demons. A zombie and a couch-potato demon for roommates. Bickering, murderous angels on his scent. Nosy NYPD detectives. And a plot to wipe out his whole family.
Oh, for the bliss of ignorance.
Now Ned's got to find a way out of this inheritance before the dark forces aligning against him give him a way out... PERMANENTLY


This is VOLUME TWO of Ned's story. (If you missed the first volume, don't worry; there's a single combined perk for both Volume One & Two. Or if you'd like to add Vol One for any of the other levels, it's available as an add-on.) As in Volume One, it's a supernatural fish-out-of-water comedy, Ned's dealing with being the new heir-apparent to his father's section in Hell, a Pit ruled by his family for generations.  Not that he's a bad son, but seeing  -and being attacked by-  demons, accidentally creating a zombie roommate, getting on the wrong side of suspicious police, and dealing with Cherubim out for blood just isn't the family life he had hoped for. And it all happened so fast that Ned barely had time to think. In this second part of the story, enough’s enough and he's taking back control of his life. He's going to find a way out of this inheritance... before it gets him killed.

 

The story runs almost 160 pages, and completes the first major story arc began in NLoP Vol 1. If I have room, there'll be extras: Behind the scenes stuff; guest pin-ups; a THANK YOU page to you the collectors. But the story is the important thing, and it almost fills the book now. The page count is not set in stone. The great thing about creator-owned and Indiegogo: No constraints. It's all my vision.

30+ years working in comics and I'm still at it. Besides various work on VALIANT comics, Deadpool, Black Panther and the BAT-books, I've been lucky to have had extended runs on some great books with amazing writers. Peter David's AQUAMAN. Judd Winnick's EXILES. GOTHAM UNDERGROUND with Frank Tieri. RED LANTERNS with Charles Soule. SECRET SIX and LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS with Gail Simone. I love comics. And because of collectors like you, I'm doing my own comics, my way. It's so much more fun, and I thank you.

The book was 90% done by the time I launched and was quick to fulfill and on time. Book 2 is about 60% finished after having less time to work on it already and I'm very excited and so far pleased with the work I have in it. I hope you will enjoy it as much as the 1st and if you have yet to pick it up, now's your chance!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any crowdfunding campaign on time fulfillment is always a challenge. Life does not care what you have planned, it makes it's own. Getting the book out on time is the ultimate challenge.

<p><strong>THE GOAL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Just a little information for you. Thrashers Issue #4 will complete the initial story arc and I am excited to see it come to fruition. I am currently wrapping up the scripts for the second arc. Thrashers is far from over.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All the Line-Art by Leonardo Rocha is complete. Those pages are currently in the capable hands of the colorist Rodrigo Ybanez. I will be sending those pages in batches to the letterer Nikki Powers, as I receive them. Then  I will begin formatting each Issue for printing. My hope is to have a quick turn around and have these in your hands before the end of September.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I came to a decision a few weeks ago, that I wanted to make this affordable for every individual that wants to support the campaign. I know that by doing this it could make reaching the funding goal difficult, but that is a risk I am willing to take.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Metal Maniacs I need your help. Share the campaign on all your social media accounts, spread the word far and wide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let’s Rock this to the end .</strong></p>

What's happening, Metal Maniacs. 
Welcome back and Thank you for giving the campaign a look see, we appreciate you.
The moshing continues in Thrashers Issues 3 and 4. 
 After having their weekend concert ruined,  Mikey, Dee, Carlos, Maria, Brian and Rocky struggle to evade the Alien assault. 
Meanwhile our Army Rangers are looking for some payback after barely surviving the attack on McMasters Army depot.

Our Metal Heads, are struggling to survive the alien onslaught but our Misfits from the Motor pool are ready to lend a hand


 
THRASHERS #4

Colors by Rodrigo Ybanez 
Letters by Nikki Powers
Cover by Tone Rodriguez

The time has come for our Metal Heads to make a stand, along with the Misfits from the Motor pool, and dish out an earthly THRASHING.

THE GOAL
Just a little information for you. Thrashers Issue #4 will complete the initial story arc and I am excited to see it come to fruition. I am currently wrapping up the scripts for the second arc. Thrashers is far from over.
All the Line-Art by Leonardo Rocha is complete. Those pages are currently in the capable hands of the colorist Rodrigo Ybanez. I will be sending those pages in batches to the letterer Nikki Powers, as I receive them. Then  I will begin formatting each Issue for printing. My hope is to have a quick turn around and have these in your hands before the end of September.
I came to a decision a few weeks ago, that I wanted to make this affordable for every individual that wants to support the campaign. I know that by doing this it could make reaching the funding goal difficult, but that is a risk I am willing to take.
Metal Maniacs I need your help. Share the campaign on all your social media accounts, spread the word far and wide.
Let’s Rock this to the end .

<h3>What is Grey Matter?</h3>
<p>Cybernetics have become part of almost every human body, pushing boundaries of what humans can do. The only downside… it slowly kills you. Downtrodden street fighter Lia is striding close to death's door, but she’s found a girl who’s untouched by the cybernetic sickness. Lia vows to get her to the safety of the inner city, out of reach of the mobsters and denizens that will kill to acquire her.</p>
<p>The first issue of Grey Matter is told over 28 pages of brilliant full colour where this futuristic world is not the paradise we were promised.</p>
<h3>Who will Like Grey Matter?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fans of Cyberpunk, Blade Runner, Children of Men, the Fifth Element, and those who like their science fiction a little less glamorous.</li>
<li>Collectors of high quality comic books who want something you won't find in stores.</li>
<li>People wanting to read a comic book from a small group of creators that are passionate of making the best damn book they can.</li>

</div></div>","What is Grey Matter?
Cybernetics have become part of almost every human body, pushing boundaries of what humans can do. The only downside… it slowly kills you. Downtrodden street fighter Lia is striding close to death's door, but she’s found a girl who’s untouched by the cybernetic sickness. Lia vows to get her to the safety of the inner city, out of reach of the mobsters and denizens that will kill to acquire her.
The first issue of Grey Matter is told over 28 pages of brilliant full colour where this futuristic world is not the paradise we were promised.
Who will Like Grey Matter?

Fans of Cyberpunk, Blade Runner, Children of Men, the Fifth Element, and those who like their science fiction a little less glamorous.
Collectors of high quality comic books who want something you won't find in stores.
People wanting to read a comic book from a small group of creators that are passionate of making the best damn book they can.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>InterStella Space Angel</i> is a story about curiosity, struggle, and hope.</strong></p>
<p>I love astronomy. There's something so curiously inaccessible and yet profoundly wondrous about the cosmos. We're so close, and yet we're not. We can see distant stars that are a million-times larger than our earth, and yet they appear as a speck. There are expanses that are mind-bogglingly large, and yet they exist in beautiful harmony and perfect balance.</p>
<p>We live in a truly magnificent universe, and through <i>InterStella Space Angel</i>, I hope to expose more people to its wonders in an effort to educate and inspire the next generation of astronomers.</p>
<p>As passionate as I am about astronomy, the story would be lacking without the heart of its message. Stella's story is a reflection of our day-to-day reality; slogging through the mundane, enjoying the silly moments, wrestling with hardships, and attempting to ascertain the greater meaning of our lives. You know—all wrapped up in a nice little 24-hour package.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>At the end of the day, we're all dreaming. We're all looking to see where all this is heading. This story is an invitation to wonder, dream, and persevere together.</i></p>

<p>I believe that <i>InterStella Space Angel</i> can spark new excitement, rekindle sidelined dreams, and inspire hope that so many people desperately need. Therefore, I want to share it with as many people as possible.

MEET STELLA—the angelic being who’s in charge of taking care of the cosmos and managing the inner workings of outer space. From sweeping the rings of Saturn, to replacing burnt-out stars—she’s got every space chore under control. But even with every star at her fingertips, she still wonders what life is like on earth, and how she can help bring the light of hope to a world in need...

Frank is thrust into a world of intrigue and excessive violence, where promotion is a matter of survival rather than skill. On his second mission the newly-made henchman receives a fatal wound, but does not die as he should; a fact which raises some intriguing possibilities.Super Serious Comics presents the first three issues of Idle Thuggery and a combined Graphic Novel (which includes issues 1-3) with additional art and a new cover from Willi Roberts.

<h2>THE OFFICIAL COVER DESIGN IS COMPLETED!</h2>
<p>I commissioned my friend Ryan Haddix (who contributed artwork for the back of book 1 &amp; 2) to design a cover for issue #3.  I've been a fan of his work for a while, and am very satisfied with the design he came up with for this next comic.  The cover image I previously had was a place holder until this artwork was done.  So here is the cover for this next book!

<p><strong>Requiem of the Crazies #3</strong> is the third installment in the harrowing <strong>8 part comic book series</strong> about two bums who uncover an insane cult leader's nefarious plot to drug and brainwash the homeless community.  <i><strong>For THIS issue</strong></i>, I'm planning to have around <i><strong>64 interior pages in full color, 6.875"" x 10.5""</strong></i>.  Along with the comic book, there are a variety of other perks you can get, so check it out.</p>

Would anyone care? Where would you go?.. Perhaps you would be forced, like so many hundreds of thousands, to live on the streets.  Homeless. a bum.  Forgotten and overlooked by the society you were cast from...  For <strong>Dante</strong>, these hypothetical questions have become a reality.  A young troubled man who finds himself living on the streets with a gun in his mouth and no where to go, is given hope for a new life when he is taken in by a streetwise bum named Vern.  <strong><i>Dante is introduced to the underground world of the homeless, the Crazies, where a bum can stay for the month of May and wont need any money.  A sanctuary for all those who have been forsaken... If only it were that easy.</i></strong>  When corrupt politicians, drug dealers and an insane cult leader begin fighting for power, the meek homeless become nothing more than pawns in a malicious game of power.  <strong><i>""I thought being homeless would be really easy""</i></strong>, Dante thinks, as him and Vern set off on their journey to fight the evil forces bent on corrupting the minds of the homeless. </p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","THE OFFICIAL COVER DESIGN IS COMPLETED!
I commissioned my friend Ryan Haddix (who contributed artwork for the back of book 1 & 2) to design a cover for issue #3.  I've been a fan of his work for a while, and am very satisfied with the design he came up with for this next comic.  The cover image I previously had was a place holder until this artwork was done.  So here is the cover for this next book! Follow Ryan on instagram HERE.


Requiem of the Crazies #3 is the third installment in the harrowing 8 part comic book series about two bums who uncover an insane cult leader's nefarious plot to drug and brainwash the homeless community.  For THIS issue, I'm planning to have around 64 interior pages in full color, 6.875"" x 10.5"".  Along with the comic book, there are a variety of other perks you can get, so check it out.
COMICS AND PRODUCTS WILL SHIP OUT BY OR BEFORE AUGUST, 2021
 
           What would you do if you completely lost it?  Your job, your home, your family... your mind.  Who would take care of you? Would anyone care? Where would you go?.. Perhaps you would be forced, like so many hundreds of thousands, to live on the streets.  Homeless. a bum.  Forgotten and overlooked by the society you were cast from...  For Dante, these hypothetical questions have become a reality.  A young troubled man who finds himself living on the streets with a gun in his mouth and no where to go, is given hope for a new life when he is taken in by a streetwise bum named Vern.  Dante is introduced to the underground world of the homeless, the Crazies, where a bum can stay for the month of May and wont need any money.  A sanctuary for all those who have been forsaken... If only it were that easy.  When corrupt politicians, drug dealers and an insane cult leader begin fighting for power, the meek homeless become nothing more than pawns in a malicious game of power.  ""I thought being homeless would be really easy"", Dante thinks, as him and Vern set off on their journey to fight the evil forces bent on corrupting the minds of the homeless. 





CLICK HERE TO READ ISSUE 1 & 2
  Previously...   After Dante is taken to the homeless encampment, under the wise wings of Vern, he is introduced to his new peers consisting of ex-drug addicts, prostitutes and felons.  Growing unease amongst the citizens of Bum Town starts to manifest once a mysterious brutish police-like presence begins to establish itself as the new authority over the homeless... Providing them with food and water, but also arresting the non-obedient trouble makers and hauling them away to an unknown location.  No one knows who these men work for, but some suspect they are a secret agency operated by the city's corrupt Mayor.  Others speculate they work for the enigmatic and elusive 'leader' of Bum Town, known only as King Kallen.  After secretly following these thugs back to their base, Dante discovers the dark fate that awaits the bums who are taken away... and an even more disturbing truth about what is put into the food provided to them.
