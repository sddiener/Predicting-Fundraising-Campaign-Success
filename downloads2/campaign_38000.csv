A breath of crisp mountain air fills your lungs and filtered sunlight trickles across your eyelids. You pull the still warm sleeping bag around you, nestling in as your body adjusts from a deep and restful sleep. The lulling voices of your fellow campers come into focus, and the rich smell of sizzling bacon and eggs wafts in through the tent flap. You pull yourself out of your tent and know that this is going to be an amazing day, one of the best days of your life. This is what we offer at the Columbia Gorge Teen Camps: An experience that will last a lifetime! We strive to enrich and challenge motivated teens in a safe and supportive outdoor environment. Our camps offer specialized instruction in rock climbing, photography, music, martial arts and paddle sports from professionals and world class experts. We foster growth in character, personal sense of independence, self-worth and self-confidence. Each day our campers are pushed to be the best they can be, and given the opportunity to express themselves in the areas that make them special.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>A little more about our camp:</strong></p>
<p>Motivated teens will spend 10 days in one of the most spectacular natural wonders in the U.S.A., in one of the following specialty camps: Music Discovery, Photography, Rock Climbing, Paddle Sports or Martial Arts. Our base camp is located in Lyle, Washington, a stone throw from the majestic Columbia Gorge River. We are a co-ed camp and cater to all teens ages 14-17, who have a desire to improve themselves and the world around them, while having the time of their lives.</p>
<p>We are in our second year of operation and are looking for funding to send four or more exceptional teens to camp this year. Normal tuition for our camps ranges from $1950 to $2,150 and for some this will prevent them from signing up. This project will help our campers reach that financial goal, and ensure them an unforgettable summer adventure. For our campers this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to pursue their passions, connect with like-minded peers and learn from remarkable instructors and counselors who are tops in their field. Last year we gave financial support to 20 deserving teens, allowing them to take part in one of our 10 day camps. This year, with help from the community we hope to do the same or better. 100% of the money raised will go towards sending aspiring teenagers to the Columbia Gorge Camps for the summer. This means all funds will be directly applied to camper tuition, not spent on miscellaneous expenses. Through this assistance, deserving teens will have a chance to create lasting impressions, and our camp will continue to grow as a catalyst for nurturing passions and dreams.</p>
<h1>Location</h1>
<p>Our teen camp is located in The Columbia River Gorge, which borders Oregon and Washington. This magnificent area is truly one of North America's most stunning natural wonders. Our base camp hugs the edge of the Columbia River. The Gorge is home to world class water sports, climbing, cycling, hiking, flora and fauna and natural beauty not found anywhere else in the world. Since its discovery the Gorge has been an inspiration to artists, a destination for outdoor/sports enthusiasts and a breeding ground for amazing people. We chose this inspirational setting to give our campers the best place to learn, grow and reach the height of their potential.</p>

<h1>Nature is Good for Everyone</h1>
<p>Time and again studies have shown that being in nature is vital to health and mental well-being. We want to make sure that this love for the outdoors stays strong in future generations. Children who spend part of their summer vacation at summer camp return to their academic year with new experiences and with revitalized energy, and do better in school. Part of our goal is to maintain a global interest in the outdoors and pass along that connection to our children. The best way of doing this is to cultivate that interest in our youth, and show them that a raging river or a rocky mountain trail is more exhilarating than a video game or late night talk show can ever be.</p>
<h1>Campers can choose from five specializations:<br/><br/>Climbing</h1>
<p>Campers will receive world class instruction from our amazing camp leaders and celebrity climbers. Rick Harrell will be heading up our 2013 program as our program director, and campers will be accompanied by Lynn Hill (session 1) and Beth Rodden (session 2) our two celebrity climbers, arguably two of the best climbers in the world. For teens who are seriously interested in climbing this is a chance to learn from the best, in one of nature's most splendid natural habitats.</p>

<h1>Photography</h1>
<p>We think the Columbia Gorge is a photographer’s paradise…rivers, waterfalls, fields of wildflowers, snow-covered mountains, ancient forests and blue skies contribute to a perfect setting for nature photography. Active outdoor sports provide the second major theme of the camp. Our campers will take photographs of their fellow campers shooting whitewater rapids in an inflatable raft; hiking to the top of a waterfall for the shot that few others get; and athletes flying past on a sailboard or kite-board. Since getting to that “right” spot may take some physical effort, campers must be in reasonable condition and capable of hiking up to five miles in a day. Our top program directors, Chuck Feil and Craig Hanson are award winning, professional photographers and great teachers. They will take the campers further in their knowledge of photography in ten days than they ever thought possible.</p>

<h1>Music</h1>
<p>Musicians come one come all! Instrumentalists, singers, songwriters and producers alike, will bring their talents to the table and discover how collaboration can enrich their art! Unlike other genre-specific music camps, the Music Discovery Camp will focus on bringing together teens whose individual interests span a wide range of styles. An open mind and zest for innovation are the key components that will enable teens to make the most of this experience. In addition to honing skills in their specific area of interest, teens will have opportunities to broaden their musical horizons by learning from their peers and studying techniques that will be beneficial to them in a vast array of musical situations. Gifted teachers, Dylan Charles and Ira Nepus will illuminate the journey of this very exciting Music Discovery Camp.</p>

<h1>Paddle Sports</h1>
<p>This is a new program that we are super excited about. This is a unique opportunity unmatched anywhere. The camp will take advantage of some of the most scenic lakes, rivers and ocean environment that the Pacific northwest of the United States has to offer. After exploring the Columbia Gorge area we will be venturing out to the coast! Our days will be filled with exploring beaches, tide pools, whitewater rafting , kayaking, stand up paddle boarding, overnight canoe trips, surfing and experiencing all the riches this picturesque area has to offer. Our Paddle Sports Camp will be headed up by Terry Kimball and Jo Evers who have vast experience in aquatics and countless credentials in teaching paddle sports and water safety to youth.</p>

<h1>Martial Arts</h1>
<p>Martial Arts and nature have long been partners for nurturing the body and the mind. Campers will study under world class martial arts masters, without the distractions of daily life. Hikes, physical training and exercises refresh and calm the mind. Teens will return from camp motivated and confident in their abilities. Our integrated martial arts camp involves helping campers become the best they can be in all aspects of their lives. Our martial arts program director, Padme Grace, has countless certifications including Master Life Coach specializing in health and wellness, personal trainer, exercise specialist, nutrition specialist, Shufoksn Karate Sensei certified, 2nd level Chun-Tu Kwan Instructor certified and 3rd degree black Belt Shudokan Karate-do, Alaska Airlines SkySafe Program and is a certified Zumba Gold Fitness instructor.

<p>Columbia Gorge Teen Camps was the brain child of Dr. Robert Hanson. Bob is a Professor-Emeritus from the San Diego State University Department of Recreation. His main area of emphasis while at SDSU was Camp Administration and Camp Counseling. Most of his adult life has been devoted to developing and running camp programs for children and youth. He is co-author of two classic books: '<em>Stories For The Campfire'</em> and <em>'Camp Program Ideas.'</em> For many years, he served as the Education Chair for the Southern California Section of the American Camp Association. After moving to Northern California Hanson held the same office in the Northern California Section for eight years. He has founded and directed several camps and outdoor programs, some of which are Mountain Camp II, Northwest Wilderness Adventures, Trinity River Rafting Center, Camp Aztec and Camp Able. A past-president of the California Alpine Club, he continues to lead yearly river canoe trips and High Sierra Base Camp trips.</p>

<h1>Who is this Camp For?</h1>
<p>Our camps are for motivated teens, ages 14 to 17, who want to pursue their best in one of our specialties. These camps are not intended to be therapy. Anyone with special needs should look elsewhere. We will not accept any teen who has a problem with authority, uses any form of tobacco, drugs or alcohol, or is subject to rude or disruptive behavior. There are many camps for teens with special needs or behavioral problems, but that’s not us.</p>

<p>Please help our camp to grow and give teens a once in a lifetime opportunity, to create lifelong memories and reach the height of their potential at Columbia Gorge Teen Camps.</p></div>","Wake up to the sound of rushing water and calling birds. A breath of crisp mountain air fills your lungs and filtered sunlight trickles across your eyelids. You pull the still warm sleeping bag around you, nestling in as your body adjusts from a deep and restful sleep. The lulling voices of your fellow campers come into focus, and the rich smell of sizzling bacon and eggs wafts in through the tent flap. You pull yourself out of your tent and know that this is going to be an amazing day, one of the best days of your life. This is what we offer at the Columbia Gorge Teen Camps: An experience that will last a lifetime! We strive to enrich and challenge motivated teens in a safe and supportive outdoor environment. Our camps offer specialized instruction in rock climbing, photography, music, martial arts and paddle sports from professionals and world class experts. We foster growth in character, personal sense of independence, self-worth and self-confidence. Each day our campers are pushed to be the best they can be, and given the opportunity to express themselves in the areas that make them special.

Campers from the 2012 season.
 
A little more about our camp:
Motivated teens will spend 10 days in one of the most spectacular natural wonders in the U.S.A., in one of the following specialty camps: Music Discovery, Photography, Rock Climbing, Paddle Sports or Martial Arts. Our base camp is located in Lyle, Washington, a stone throw from the majestic Columbia Gorge River. We are a co-ed camp and cater to all teens ages 14-17, who have a desire to improve themselves and the world around them, while having the time of their lives.
We are in our second year of operation and are looking for funding to send four or more exceptional teens to camp this year. Normal tuition for our camps ranges from $1950 to $2,150 and for some this will prevent them from signing up. This project will help our campers reach that financial goal, and ensure them an unforgettable summer adventure. For our campers this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to pursue their passions, connect with like-minded peers and learn from remarkable instructors and counselors who are tops in their field. Last year we gave financial support to 20 deserving teens, allowing them to take part in one of our 10 day camps. This year, with help from the community we hope to do the same or better. 100% of the money raised will go towards sending aspiring teenagers to the Columbia Gorge Camps for the summer. This means all funds will be directly applied to camper tuition, not spent on miscellaneous expenses. Through this assistance, deserving teens will have a chance to create lasting impressions, and our camp will continue to grow as a catalyst for nurturing passions and dreams.
Location
Our teen camp is located in The Columbia River Gorge, which borders Oregon and Washington. This magnificent area is truly one of North America's most stunning natural wonders. Our base camp hugs the edge of the Columbia River. The Gorge is home to world class water sports, climbing, cycling, hiking, flora and fauna and natural beauty not found anywhere else in the world. Since its discovery the Gorge has been an inspiration to artists, a destination for outdoor/sports enthusiasts and a breeding ground for amazing people. We chose this inspirational setting to give our campers the best place to learn, grow and reach the height of their potential.

Nature is Good for Everyone
Time and again studies have shown that being in nature is vital to health and mental well-being. We want to make sure that this love for the outdoors stays strong in future generations. Children who spend part of their summer vacation at summer camp return to their academic year with new experiences and with revitalized energy, and do better in school. Part of our goal is to maintain a global interest in the outdoors and pass along that connection to our children. The best way of doing this is to cultivate that interest in our youth, and show them that a raging river or a rocky mountain trail is more exhilarating than a video game or late night talk show can ever be.
Campers can choose from five specializations:Climbing
Campers will receive world class instruction from our amazing camp leaders and celebrity climbers. Rick Harrell will be heading up our 2013 program as our program director, and campers will be accompanied by Lynn Hill (session 1) and Beth Rodden (session 2) our two celebrity climbers, arguably two of the best climbers in the world. For teens who are seriously interested in climbing this is a chance to learn from the best, in one of nature's most splendid natural habitats.

Photography
We think the Columbia Gorge is a photographer’s paradise…rivers, waterfalls, fields of wildflowers, snow-covered mountains, ancient forests and blue skies contribute to a perfect setting for nature photography. Active outdoor sports provide the second major theme of the camp. Our campers will take photographs of their fellow campers shooting whitewater rapids in an inflatable raft; hiking to the top of a waterfall for the shot that few others get; and athletes flying past on a sailboard or kite-board. Since getting to that “right” spot may take some physical effort, campers must be in reasonable condition and capable of hiking up to five miles in a day. Our top program directors, Chuck Feil and Craig Hanson are award winning, professional photographers and great teachers. They will take the campers further in their knowledge of photography in ten days than they ever thought possible.

Music
Musicians come one come all! Instrumentalists, singers, songwriters and producers alike, will bring their talents to the table and discover how collaboration can enrich their art! Unlike other genre-specific music camps, the Music Discovery Camp will focus on bringing together teens whose individual interests span a wide range of styles. An open mind and zest for innovation are the key components that will enable teens to make the most of this experience. In addition to honing skills in their specific area of interest, teens will have opportunities to broaden their musical horizons by learning from their peers and studying techniques that will be beneficial to them in a vast array of musical situations. Gifted teachers, Dylan Charles and Ira Nepus will illuminate the journey of this very exciting Music Discovery Camp.

Paddle Sports
This is a new program that we are super excited about. This is a unique opportunity unmatched anywhere. The camp will take advantage of some of the most scenic lakes, rivers and ocean environment that the Pacific northwest of the United States has to offer. After exploring the Columbia Gorge area we will be venturing out to the coast! Our days will be filled with exploring beaches, tide pools, whitewater rafting , kayaking, stand up paddle boarding, overnight canoe trips, surfing and experiencing all the riches this picturesque area has to offer. Our Paddle Sports Camp will be headed up by Terry Kimball and Jo Evers who have vast experience in aquatics and countless credentials in teaching paddle sports and water safety to youth.

Martial Arts
Martial Arts and nature have long been partners for nurturing the body and the mind. Campers will study under world class martial arts masters, without the distractions of daily life. Hikes, physical training and exercises refresh and calm the mind. Teens will return from camp motivated and confident in their abilities. Our integrated martial arts camp involves helping campers become the best they can be in all aspects of their lives. Our martial arts program director, Padme Grace, has countless certifications including Master Life Coach specializing in health and wellness, personal trainer, exercise specialist, nutrition specialist, Shufoksn Karate Sensei certified, 2nd level Chun-Tu Kwan Instructor certified and 3rd degree black Belt Shudokan Karate-do, Alaska Airlines SkySafe Program and is a certified Zumba Gold Fitness instructor. She works with Integrated Martial Arts full time and has over 16 years of impressive experience working with children, teens, and families.

Dr. Robert Hanson
Columbia Gorge Teen Camps was the brain child of Dr. Robert Hanson. Bob is a Professor-Emeritus from the San Diego State University Department of Recreation. His main area of emphasis while at SDSU was Camp Administration and Camp Counseling. Most of his adult life has been devoted to developing and running camp programs for children and youth. He is co-author of two classic books: 'Stories For The Campfire' and 'Camp Program Ideas.' For many years, he served as the Education Chair for the Southern California Section of the American Camp Association. After moving to Northern California Hanson held the same office in the Northern California Section for eight years. He has founded and directed several camps and outdoor programs, some of which are Mountain Camp II, Northwest Wilderness Adventures, Trinity River Rafting Center, Camp Aztec and Camp Able. A past-president of the California Alpine Club, he continues to lead yearly river canoe trips and High Sierra Base Camp trips.

Who is this Camp For?
Our camps are for motivated teens, ages 14 to 17, who want to pursue their best in one of our specialties. These camps are not intended to be therapy. Anyone with special needs should look elsewhere. We will not accept any teen who has a problem with authority, uses any form of tobacco, drugs or alcohol, or is subject to rude or disruptive behavior. There are many camps for teens with special needs or behavioral problems, but that’s not us.

<p>The Campaign has now ended. A huge thank you to everyone who donated, tweeted, shared and spread the word. We are extremely grateful to you all. Although I haven't raised as much as I'd hoped, the donations will be so gratefully received and more helpful than you could know (unless you've been in a similar position). Sarah x</p>
<p>I would like to help Tina, a professional dog walker &amp; pet carer who has been kind, helpful, flexible, reliable and supportive to me and all her customers over many years. She has been ill since July with an excruciatingly painful acute patellofemoral pain syndrome. Basically her kneecap is scraping instead of gliding over the lower femur because of a sprained knee ligament and the whole leg is severely restricted by pain. It was all caused by a movement to avoid treading on and hurting a small dog that had run under her foot as she was walking.</p>
<p>Therefore Tina has been unable to work properly for four months and is now in a very bad financial position. Added to the painful knee/leg and the side effects of all the anti-inflammatories, she is now deeply depressed about not being able to pay her bills. This week she has been told the knee/leg may not fully recover because of both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. She feels a failure without anyone to turn to for help.</p>
<p>Tina has been a single parent for many years. Her oldest child’s father died and the younger children’s father walked out on them when they were babies and has refused to be part of their lives. They have had some very traumatic situations to deal with over a long period of time and have no extended family to help. So I’m asking if we can support her collectively. If it was the other way around Tina would most definitely help us.</p>
<p>I am going to ask for a relatively small amount as anything would help her out and be so gratefully received. Initially she needs money to pay for utilities and mortgage payments which are now in arrears and at risk of being cut off and the house repossessed. Tina has just discovered that her beloved dog has a tumour and needs an immediate operation to remove it.  She needs urgent dental treatment and her vehicle without which she is unable to work at all also needs a number of critical repairs. </p>
<p>It would be fantastic if you could support Tina in any way at all by either sending a donation and/or spreading the word by telling your friends, sending them the link and also sending links to the campaign out with all your emails and following on Twitter.</p>
<p>I believe that Paypal donations go through to the recipient straight away, so anything sent by that method of payment will have an immediate impact in both financial terms and emotional support. It would be fantastic for Tina to know that people want to help her get out of a deep and dark place. It would make a huge difference.</p>
<p>Long term Tina has debts which have mounted up over the years because her mortgage is far too high (one of those that the banks should never have given) and therefore her income, although she has always worked seven days a week, 52 weeks a year, including all holidays, is usually only enough to cover the basics as a single parent family with nothing left to save for emergencies and extras despite being frugal.</p>
<p>Can you help me to give Tina freedom from debt and financial security?</p>
<p>Please, please help this campaign raise as much as possible and thank you so, so much for donating and spreading the word.</p>

<hr/><p>The project ""Touristic and Environmental Development of Vila Formosa” is the most recent threat to the heritage of Natural Park of Southwest Alentejo and Costa Vicentina, in Portugal, which is considered one of the Europe's best-preserved coastline areas, with unique species of wild fauna and flora.</p>
<p>There is a real risk of urbanization of a 55 hectares area in<span class=""b1""> t</span><span class=""b2"">he municipality of Odemira</span>, located less than 2 kilometres from the coast, involving a hotel, two touristic villages and also entertainment facilities for sport practice and thematic events. This investment will destroy the habitat of endemic species of flora and fauna, such as <em>Ononis hackelli</em>, a plant classified as highest conservation priority, and the Cabrera's Vole (<em>Microtus cabrerae</em>) habitat. It is likely to have potential impacts in the Mira River estuary as well.</p>
<p>This project ignores the guidelines of the Regional Strategic Territorial Plan for Alentejo Region and clearly compromises the Municipal Master Plan of Odemira. Farmlands with agricultural potential, which are part of Mira River Irrigation Area, will now be converted to urbanized area.</p>

 Help Quercus to set a legal action to protect one of Europe's best-preserved coastline areas!
Versão portuguesa
The project ""Touristic and Environmental Development of Vila Formosa” is the most recent threat to the heritage of Natural Park of Southwest Alentejo and Costa Vicentina, in Portugal, which is considered one of the Europe's best-preserved coastline areas, with unique species of wild fauna and flora.
There is a real risk of urbanization of a 55 hectares area in the municipality of Odemira, located less than 2 kilometres from the coast, involving a hotel, two touristic villages and also entertainment facilities for sport practice and thematic events. This investment will destroy the habitat of endemic species of flora and fauna, such as Ononis hackelli, a plant classified as highest conservation priority, and the Cabrera's Vole (Microtus cabrerae) habitat. It is likely to have potential impacts in the Mira River estuary as well.
This project ignores the guidelines of the Regional Strategic Territorial Plan for Alentejo Region and clearly compromises the Municipal Master Plan of Odemira. Farmlands with agricultural potential, which are part of Mira River Irrigation Area, will now be converted to urbanized area.
The environmental impact assessment was not properly made for this investment, because no alternative locations were presented, as required under the legislation, which provides the evaluation of alternatives, including the zero alternative. This is even more significant, considering that this project is being held in a classified area for biodiversity conservation.
The Natural Park Territorial Plan’s Regulation, which aims to control the construction outside urban areas to protect natural values, was also forgotten.
Moreover, the previous Government introduced a paragraph in the transitory regime of the Resolution of the Ministers Council n.º 11-B/2011, of 4th February, article 87, nº 8 (a Governmental law that created the Regulation of PNSACV), which represented an illegal and anti-constitutional measure clearly benefiting the promoters of the project, that have been trying for many years to urbanize the remaining part of this unique natural heritage.

Construction will begin on the database in early August and we have a target launch date of October 1st, just in time for the 2nd Annual Students for Zero Waste Conference! 
Any additional funds raised will go towards maintenance on the database: updates, upgrades, and troubleshooting expenses as we continue to build this movement. Our STRETCH Goal is an additional $1,000 by August 1st. 

About PLAN:
The Post-Landfill Action Network (PLAN) is a nonprofit, cooperative network of student leaders working to achieve zero waste in their campus communities. We support the implementation of practical waste-reduction initiatives, educate students about the waste crisis, and help train the next generation of leaders for the zero waste movement. Our goal is to create zero waste campuses that lead the way to a zero waste world where landfills and incinerators are obsolete.


   
The Project: Building a Zero Waste Campus Platform and DatabaseOver the past two years the PLAN team has had the privilege to work with many incredible people leading innovative zero waste projects on campuses across the country.From the inspiration of their work we believe that a zero waste campus is possible--but it cannot be done alone! PLAN has received hundreds of resources from campuses across the country and we have seen campuses learn from each other to improve their programs and build a movement. We want to simplify the sharing process and make it accessible to all. With an easy to access, searchable database students can collaborate with ease.  The PLAN staff, student organizers and other leaders in zero waste can answer questions in a public forum. This searchable, crowd-sourced, zero waste database will create the foundation for successful campaigns.There is no need for campuses to reinvent the wheel!The platform will provide the following basic functions:1.  A collaborative discussion board broken up into specific projects and programs. Through this discussion board any individual (students, admin, etc) can create a free account to access and participate in the conversations, and upload/download resources at any time.2.  Documents will be uploadable and downloadable for free.3.  All discussion boards and uploads will be tagged with searchable keywords (ex: “composting”, or “procurement policies”) which will organize content in a navigable library.Perks:We will email you information on how to redeem your Yerdle Reuse Dollars after you donate!Here is the campaign sticker you will receive:

<h2>Help us put the bearded vultures on the move</h2>

<p>Hi, my name is <strong>Alex Llopis Dell</strong>, I work at the <a href=""http://www.4vultures.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Vulture Conservation Foundation</strong></a>, and I am the coordinator of the <strong>Bearded vulture European Endangered Species Programme (EEP)</strong>. I am responsible for the captive breeding network for the Bearded vulture, which is crucial for providing young birds to be released into the wild in 5 different European regions right now.</p>
<p>We urgently need your help to assist with the <strong>transport of 19 bearded vultures across Europe</strong>, and make sure the reintroduction of the Bearded vulture is a long term success.</p>
<p>In Europe, in what is known as <strong>one of the most successful stories of a species recovery from extinction</strong>, bearded vultures have been reintroduced into the wild since 1986. This initiative, which is led by the VCF, has enabled the release of more than <strong>300 young birds</strong> to the <strong>Alps</strong>, <strong>Cazorla (Andalusia, Spain)</strong>, <strong>Massif Central (France)</strong>, <strong>Corsica (France)</strong> and, more recently, <strong>Maestrazgo (Valencia, Spain)</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>DEUTCH: Wir brauchen dringend Eure Hilfe um 19 Bartgeier quer durch Europa zu transportieren. </strong>Diese Bartgeier sind Teil vom Bartgeier-Zuchtprogramm und brauchen medizinische Hilfe, einen Partner oder einen sicheren Ort wo sie vor Krankheiten sicher sind. Nur dank dem Zuchtprogramm können wir Bartgeier in den Alpen, dem Zentralmassiv und auf Korsika in Frankreich sowie in Andalusien und Maestrazgo, Spanien auswildern und so diesen eindrücklichen Segler zurückbringen.<strong> </strong></i></p>

Ce n'est que grâce au programme d'élevage que nous pouvons relâcher des gypaètes barbus dans les Alpes, le Massif Central et la Corse en France ainsi qu'en Andalousie et au Maestrazgo en Espagne et ainsi faire revenir cet impressionnant marin.</i></p>

<h3>So, if things are going so well, why do we need your help?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537230320/qq1z15qwc4mdcod6wczr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are currently <strong>increasing the number of reintroduction areas</strong>, to make sure it is a success in the long term, so yearly we need to make sure we have more captive bred young to release into the wild! This means we need some of the birds to find a suitable partner in the captive breeding network. <strong>And let me tell you, the bearded vultures have very strong personalities and they do not get along with any bird!</strong></p>
<p>The success of the bearded vulture EEP depends on <strong>successful pairing of birds</strong>, <strong>good networking of partners</strong>, and <strong>attention to every detail of each individual bird</strong>, with the final goal of increasing the number of birds to release to the wild.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been outbreaks of the <strong>West Nile virus</strong>, a disease carried by mosquitoes, which caused a few deaths of Bearded vultures within the EEP. <strong>We need to move some of these birds to centres at higher altitude and colder climate</strong>, where the mosquitoes cannot survive and the vultures can be safe of the West Nile virus.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the birds has some health issues and needs<strong> careful veterinary assistance</strong> at a more specialized centre.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Safe and fast transport for the birds is crucial!</h3>
<p>Your support is critical for us to be able to provide safe and quick transport for these birds. Some of them will be <strong>travelling by plane</strong>, others <strong>by car</strong>, and <strong>we need your help to secure these transports</strong>. Plane transports cost around <strong>1000 euros for each bird</strong>, car transports are a bit cheaper (around 300 - 500 euros), but sometimes they require more time, a lot of km on the road, and so we are planning a few stops, feeding the birds when needed along the way, to make sure the birds are stress free and comfortable on the move. Finally we have to make sure we have all the paper work which is legally needed to transport wildlife.</p>
<p>All in all, we need a <strong>total of 7.500 euros to transport the 19 birds</strong>, which includes <strong>car and plane transport costs</strong> between zoos and specialized breeding centres.</p>
<p>The technical work of captive breeding network and the bird releases are funded by us, partner zoos and several different funders and projects, but these bird transfers are not covered by our current budget at the VCF. That is why we decided to launch an urgent crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Bearded vulture gifts to you</h3>
<p>To thank you for your support, we have prepared some exclusive gifts, which allow us to share our passion for bearded vultures with all of you. Some of these include <strong>printed photographs </strong>of the bearded vultures by <a href=""http://www.weyrichfoto.ch/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Hansruedi Weyrich</strong></a>, others feature a <strong>funny bearded vulture caricature </strong>by <a href=""http://www.greenhumour.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Green Humour</strong></a>, and we are even offering <strong>a personal guided tour to one of our specialized captive breeding centres</strong> at Lleida, Spain, or at Haringsee, Austria, to see these amazing birds and <strong>get to know us and our work in person!</strong></p>
<p><br/>Every donation is important for us, as a <strong>non-profit organization</strong>, and we will put <strong>your name on our donors list </strong>on our webpage and on our annual review.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537230592/xkntjpth8yjhtuvexnje.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><strong>BG 977</strong> was born at Vallcalent on 31/01/2018, from first-time parents BG 297 x BG 115. They had never been successful breeding before, so we were monitoring them closely. What we discovered was that the female had a slight limp on one leg and was not able to prepare a good nest bowl for the eggs. Thus the eggs were constantly rolling all over the nest and many were found broken.<br/>This year, we decided to intervene, and removed 3 eggs from the nest, to make sure they would not break. From these 3 eggs, 2 chicks hatched, including BG 977, who was the first to hatch, and was then adopted and reared successfully by an imprinted male. Because he is imprinted, he is not able to pair with another bird, but this successful male has reared other birds' chicks by himself!</p>

<h3>The whole picture – the story of the bearded vulture reintroduction project (1975-2018)</h3>
<p>The reintroduction of the bearded vulture into Europe is one of the world´s greatest wildlife comeback stories of all times, and an ongoing project and adventure that continues to gather stakeholders, members of the public, and general interest, all around. From near extinction in Europe we have managed, in a few decades, to bring back the species to the Alps and Andalusia, and are continuing to work towards restoring the species across the continent.</p>
<p><br/>Bearded vultures were once widely distributed across Eurasia and Africa, with significant populations in most of the main mountain ranges in these continents. The species used to breed in almost all of Europe, from Spain to the Balkans, passing through the Pyrenees and the Alps. This ensured a constant genetic exchange and kept a healthy European meta-population. However, this situation rapidly changed during the 19th century and by the beginning of the last century the species was almost entirely wiped out. Only three populations survived in Western Europe, two small island groups in Corsica and Crete, and the main one in the Pyrenees, none of them self-sustaining without specific actions, and certainly not in large-enough numbers to re-colonize its former distribution range. In these situations, reintroductions seem to be the only viable way of recovering such highly damaged meta-populations.</p>
<p><br/>In 1978, the idea of bringing back the bearded vulture to the Alps started to take form, and the first releases into the wild took place almost a decade later, in 1986. The time in between was used to set up the basis of a coordinated international programme, developed with the intention of establishing a long-lasting and captive-breeding network that would produce offspring for future reintroductions. This concept, which was rather novel at the time, would be used in other breeding plans aimed for conservation, and was also instrumental in the establishment of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) European Endangered Species Programme (EEP). The bearded vulture breeding programme was thus one of the first EEPs to be accepted and implemented.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537232017/anmi8yceg5oxx2yrygjk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>Bearded Vulture EEP</strong> nowadays is composed of a network of 42 institutions mainly distributed across Europe, comprising 35 zoos, 3 large (red) and 2 small (green) specialized captive-breeding centres, and 3 private keepers, which in total keep and breed 174 bearded vultures for conservation purposes. This network is managed by the VCF, which also owns 80% of the captive bearded vultures. All partners follow and respect the best practice guidelines for captive-breeding bearded vultures developed over the years.</p>
<p>The goal of this international captive breeding program (EEP) is the conservation in situ of the species, using the produced nestlings as a base basis for reintroduction projects approved by the VCF/EEP. And the VCF’s final goal is to restore the species across its former range in Europe and establish a European Bearded Vulture meta-population, connecting the current extant isolated populations (Pyrenees, Corsica and Crete) with the reintroduced populations (The Alps, The Massif Central, Andalusia, in a continuum that extends from northern Africa (Morocco) to Asia (Turkey &amp; the Caucasus).</p>

<h3>Our strength is our network and strategy</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The Bearded vulture European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) is an International captive breeding program which started in 1978. This program is composed by a large number of different types of institutions: private and municipal Zoos, private collectors, NGO’s, and Governmental recovery centers.</p>
<p>The Vulture Conservation Foundation is the leading partner of this group, gives technical support to all organizations, defines the strategy and the guidelines of the EEP.</p>
<p>Since the beginning the objectives of this programme were clear and are still valid today:<br/>-    to create and maintain a captive stock as a genetic reserve for the species<br/>-    to produce chicks which are able to reproduce as they reach adult age <br/>-    to establish a wild population, capable to survive and reproduce independently of human intervention.</p>
<p>Finally, with the VCF working at an European scale, the ultimate aim of the programme is to establish an European meta-population of Bearded Vultures, creating gene flow between the existing isolated autochthonous populations in Europe, linking the Alps, the Pyrenees, Corsica, and Crete to the populations in North Africa and Asia.</p>
<p>My main task as coordinator of the BV EEP is to achieve this established final goal: to create a European meta-population of Bearded Vultures. </p>
<p>To reach this final goal it is necessary to assure the <strong>continuity of this captive breeding network</strong> and to p<strong>rovide young birds for all running reintroduction projects</strong>. We have not only to provide a certain number of chicks per year, we have also to provide the adequate birds for<strong> creating a human independent and self-sustainable wild population</strong>.</p>
<p>This requires a<strong> meticulous planning of pairing of birds and pair distribution</strong> inside the EEP, as well as adequately <strong>selecting the right nestling for each reintroduction project</strong>, following criteria on sex ratio and genetics.</p>
<p>Finally, to make sure that we are <strong>fomenting the development of natural behaviour</strong> in captive bred birds, we make sure <strong>all bearded vulture chicks are natural reared, with absolutely no human intervention in feeding or caring</strong>. This is done by <strong>adult birds only</strong>, either the parents of the chick or adoptive/foster parents. </p>
<p><strong>Thanks to all this work it was possible to increase the captive breeding network step by step and consequently the yearly number of produced chicks, making it possible to start new reintroduction projects. </strong></p>
<p>The key factor of all these successes is to know that pair formation in Bearded Vultures can be complicated and dangerous. That is why it was decided to create a distinction between centres dedicated exclusively to breeding (zoos and private centres) and centres dedicated to breeding and pair formation (Specialized Breeding Centres: SBCs). The role of the first is to house already established pairs and to breed the maximum number of offspring from them, while the specialized centers have specialized staff and are responsible for establishing new pairs, taking in new founders (injured birds from the wild), adopting chicks, housing problematic birds, and creating a genetic reserve by receiving specimens from all of the genetic lineages that make up the EEP.</p>
<p>Additionally a new technical assistance support service was created in 2013, giving all the partners the possibility to request the visit of a specialist on captive breeding of this species to receive suggestions on how to improve the facilities where their Bearded vultures are housed and consequently reduce the mortality of birds and increase breeding success at the zoos. More than half of the zoos have been visited by us during the last 5 years and have improved the aviary following our advice, showing a significantly increase of the average age of death of the birds.</p>
<p>All this effort made by all these partners makes possible that from an initial 40 birds, the captive population now has 174 birds, and a total yearly average production of around 25 chicks, assuring the continuity of all on-going reintroduction projects.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>If we do not reach the fundraising goal, we will need to postpone some of the transports to another year, and still go through to the most urgent transports, namely the transfer of birds which need protection from disease.</p>
<p>If we exceed our initial fundraising goal, additional funds will go towards the building of new aviaries and improvement of current facilities at the Vallcalent Specialized Breeding Centre.</p>
<p>We hope you join us on this journey to bring the bearded vulture back to the European skies, from Western Spain to the Balkans!</p>

Hi, my name is Alex Llopis Dell, I work at the Vulture Conservation Foundation, and I am the coordinator of the Bearded vulture European Endangered Species Programme (EEP). I am responsible for the captive breeding network for the Bearded vulture, which is crucial for providing young birds to be released into the wild in 5 different European regions right now.
We urgently need your help to assist with the transport of 19 bearded vultures across Europe, and make sure the reintroduction of the Bearded vulture is a long term success.
In Europe, in what is known as one of the most successful stories of a species recovery from extinction, bearded vultures have been reintroduced into the wild since 1986. This initiative, which is led by the VCF, has enabled the release of more than 300 young birds to the Alps, Cazorla (Andalusia, Spain), Massif Central (France), Corsica (France) and, more recently, Maestrazgo (Valencia, Spain).
 
DEUTCH: Wir brauchen dringend Eure Hilfe um 19 Bartgeier quer durch Europa zu transportieren. Diese Bartgeier sind Teil vom Bartgeier-Zuchtprogramm und brauchen medizinische Hilfe, einen Partner oder einen sicheren Ort wo sie vor Krankheiten sicher sind. Nur dank dem Zuchtprogramm können wir Bartgeier in den Alpen, dem Zentralmassiv und auf Korsika in Frankreich sowie in Andalusien und Maestrazgo, Spanien auswildern und so diesen eindrücklichen Segler zurückbringen.

Ce n'est que grâce au programme d'élevage que nous pouvons relâcher des gypaètes barbus dans les Alpes, le Massif Central et la Corse en France ainsi qu'en Andalousie et au Maestrazgo en Espagne et ainsi faire revenir cet impressionnant marin.

So, if things are going so well, why do we need your help?

We are currently increasing the number of reintroduction areas, to make sure it is a success in the long term, so yearly we need to make sure we have more captive bred young to release into the wild! This means we need some of the birds to find a suitable partner in the captive breeding network. And let me tell you, the bearded vultures have very strong personalities and they do not get along with any bird!
The success of the bearded vulture EEP depends on successful pairing of birds, good networking of partners, and attention to every detail of each individual bird, with the final goal of increasing the number of birds to release to the wild.
Recently, there have been outbreaks of the West Nile virus, a disease carried by mosquitoes, which caused a few deaths of Bearded vultures within the EEP. We need to move some of these birds to centres at higher altitude and colder climate, where the mosquitoes cannot survive and the vultures can be safe of the West Nile virus.
Finally, one of the birds has some health issues and needs careful veterinary assistance at a more specialized centre.
 

Safe and fast transport for the birds is crucial!
Your support is critical for us to be able to provide safe and quick transport for these birds. Some of them will be travelling by plane, others by car, and we need your help to secure these transports. Plane transports cost around 1000 euros for each bird, car transports are a bit cheaper (around 300 - 500 euros), but sometimes they require more time, a lot of km on the road, and so we are planning a few stops, feeding the birds when needed along the way, to make sure the birds are stress free and comfortable on the move. Finally we have to make sure we have all the paper work which is legally needed to transport wildlife.
All in all, we need a total of 7.500 euros to transport the 19 birds, which includes car and plane transport costs between zoos and specialized breeding centres.
The technical work of captive breeding network and the bird releases are funded by us, partner zoos and several different funders and projects, but these bird transfers are not covered by our current budget at the VCF. That is why we decided to launch an urgent crowdfunding campaign.
 
Our Bearded vulture gifts to you
To thank you for your support, we have prepared some exclusive gifts, which allow us to share our passion for bearded vultures with all of you. Some of these include printed photographs of the bearded vultures by Hansruedi Weyrich, others feature a funny bearded vulture caricature by Green Humour, and we are even offering a personal guided tour to one of our specialized captive breeding centres at Lleida, Spain, or at Haringsee, Austria, to see these amazing birds and get to know us and our work in person!
Every donation is important for us, as a non-profit organization, and we will put your name on our donors list on our webpage and on our annual review.
 
Who are these 19 bearded vultures? And where are they going exactly?

 
1. Meet BG 977 male (2018) and BG 1007 female (2018). They are meeting for the first time this year, and hopefully they will get along and form a new pair
BG 977 was born at Vallcalent on 31/01/2018, from first-time parents BG 297 x BG 115. They had never been successful breeding before, so we were monitoring them closely. What we discovered was that the female had a slight limp on one leg and was not able to prepare a good nest bowl for the eggs. Thus the eggs were constantly rolling all over the nest and many were found broken.This year, we decided to intervene, and removed 3 eggs from the nest, to make sure they would not break. From these 3 eggs, 2 chicks hatched, including BG 977, who was the first to hatch, and was then adopted and reared successfully by an imprinted male. Because he is imprinted, he is not able to pair with another bird, but this successful male has reared other birds' chicks by himself!
BG 1007 was the last chick to hatch this year within the EEP on 23/04/2018 at Richard Faust Centre (RFZ), Austria. She hatched in the incubator, with assistance, and was then adopted by her own parents. Her parents were able to breed twice this year! This is the first time a single breeding pair has produced two clutches in one year, the first and last juveniles of the breeding season.

2. Meet BG 327 male (1999) and BG 381 female (2001). They are looking for a new home and maybe a different partner, because it’s really not working between them...
BG 327 male hatched at RFZ, Austria, on 07/03/1999. His mother was the last existing bird from the Balkans Peninsula (in and ex situ), who died on 29/08/2010. BG 327 is one of 4 live descendants from this important female. So a sort of VIP bird in the EEP.
BG 381 female hatched at Almaty zoo, Kazakhstan, on 01/03/2001. She is thought to have been at least partially hand-reared. In 2002 she was transferred to Riga zoo and started to breed in 2011, laying her first egg, but was never successful in her attempts.The bearded vulture pair has not been successful in breeding for the past years and has laid infertile eggs, so they both are moving to the specialized captive breeding centre at Vallcalent, to try to find a solution.

3. Meet BG 080 male (1985) and BG 212 male (1994). They are swapping homes to hopefully find new partners
BG 080 was born at Innsbruck zoo, Austria, on 03/03/1985. He is an old experienced bird, which has bred at Hannover zoo with success from 1991 to 2013. When the female died, he was transferred to RFZ, Austria and is now a good foster parent. We know that Bearded vulture males are fertile until the end of their lives, so we would like to find him a new suitable partner at the La Garenne zoo, Switzerland. 
BG 212 was born at Tierpark Friedrichsfelde, Berlin, Germany, on 28/02/1994. Until September 2012 was determined as a female and unfortunately was not able to mate with other males, between 1994 and 2012. Interestingly enough, the pair was frequently observed bonding and building a nest, but of course they never laid an egg. When the second male died in 2012, sex determination was repeated and we found out he was a male!At Puy du Fou, France, he was finally paired with a female! But the male was never able to successfully mate. We tried with a different female at La Garenne zoo, Switzerland, but again, it did not work. Finally, it has been decided to use the bird as a foster parent, with an older female.

4. Meet GypHelp BG 973 male (2017). He has some feather problems and is going on a social trip to hopefully start feeling better.
On 26/07/2018, the team from Asters, monitoring the wild bearded vulture breeding pairs, found a young chick at Bargy nord. Probably he flew from the nest, but was now unable to fly again. His parents were feeding him regularly, but after one month the team could see that he was still not able to fly, so he was transferred to the Tichodrome recovery centre to find out what the problem was and help the bird.A feather abnormality was identified, which could be of genetic origin, and we need to transfer him to Guadalentín Specialized Breeding Centre (Cazorla, Spain) to give him the opportunity to have social contact with other birds. We would like to put it together with Rin Ran, a wild bearded vulture female which fell from the nest and had to go through eye surgery recently. In Guadalentín staff will continue to observe his moult process.

5. Meet BG 727 male (2017), he is on the move to be a chaperon to a lone female at the Goldau zoo
This imprinted bird was hand-reared by a private collector, and is now at Pairi Daiza, in Belgium. He will now travel to Goldau zoo (Switzerland) to keep a lone female company until 2019. The female lost her mate and it is important she has company until the next breeding season, while we find a suitable new partner for her. When a new breeding male is found, the chaperon will be transferred to the RFZ center, Austria, by car after next breeding season (2019).

6. Meet BG 398 female (2002). She needs artificial incubation for her eggs, so she needs to be at a specialized breeding centre
Born in Almaty zoo, on 13/03/2002, this female was hand-reared by humans. This has resulted in the need to always remove the eggs after being laid, because she is not capable of incubating the eggs and rearing the chicks. She is now at a German private collection. At Richard Faust Zentrum Specialized Breeding Centre, Austria, this female will be paired with another male and specialized artificial incubation is available.

7. Meet BG 726 (founder female, 2008?). She is looking for a new partner and she probably also needs artificial incubation for her eggs
Possibly born in 2008, in an unknown place, this female arrived at the Yerevan Zoo, Armenia, on 05/04/2008. We do not know if she was hand-reared. She was later sold to the Nikolaev zoo, where she lives now.Being a female, if all goes well and we find a suitable partner for her, there is a chance that the new pair produces important descendants for the EEP.

8. Meet BG 844 (2015) and BG 673 (2011). They are a breeding pair looking for a new home in Ukraine
BG 844 male, born at Guadalentín, Spain, on the 26/02/2015. He is a descendant from a very successful breeding pair (16 fledglings in 10 breeding seasons!). Most of them have been released in different reintroduction projects. He is a sibling from the the wild breeding sibling pair Hortelano x Marchena, from Andalusia. He is now at the Richard Faust Zentrum Specialized Breeding Centre, Austria.
BG 673 female, also born at Guadalentín, on the 21/03/2011. She is a descendant from a second very successful breeding pair (14 fledglings in 11 breeding seasons!). Most of them have been also released in different reintroduction projects. She is a sibling from the successful Andalusia wild breeding female Blimunda. She is now at the Richard Faust Zentrum Specialized Breeding Centre, Austria.
This pair will be transferred to Nikolaev zoo, in exchange for founder birds, and to establish a breeding pair there.

The whole picture – the story of the bearded vulture reintroduction project (1975-2018)
The reintroduction of the bearded vulture into Europe is one of the world´s greatest wildlife comeback stories of all times, and an ongoing project and adventure that continues to gather stakeholders, members of the public, and general interest, all around. From near extinction in Europe we have managed, in a few decades, to bring back the species to the Alps and Andalusia, and are continuing to work towards restoring the species across the continent.
Bearded vultures were once widely distributed across Eurasia and Africa, with significant populations in most of the main mountain ranges in these continents. The species used to breed in almost all of Europe, from Spain to the Balkans, passing through the Pyrenees and the Alps. This ensured a constant genetic exchange and kept a healthy European meta-population. However, this situation rapidly changed during the 19th century and by the beginning of the last century the species was almost entirely wiped out. Only three populations survived in Western Europe, two small island groups in Corsica and Crete, and the main one in the Pyrenees, none of them self-sustaining without specific actions, and certainly not in large-enough numbers to re-colonize its former distribution range. In these situations, reintroductions seem to be the only viable way of recovering such highly damaged meta-populations.
In 1978, the idea of bringing back the bearded vulture to the Alps started to take form, and the first releases into the wild took place almost a decade later, in 1986. The time in between was used to set up the basis of a coordinated international programme, developed with the intention of establishing a long-lasting and captive-breeding network that would produce offspring for future reintroductions. This concept, which was rather novel at the time, would be used in other breeding plans aimed for conservation, and was also instrumental in the establishment of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) European Endangered Species Programme (EEP). The bearded vulture breeding programme was thus one of the first EEPs to be accepted and implemented.

 
The Bearded Vulture EEP nowadays is composed of a network of 42 institutions mainly distributed across Europe, comprising 35 zoos, 3 large (red) and 2 small (green) specialized captive-breeding centres, and 3 private keepers, which in total keep and breed 174 bearded vultures for conservation purposes. This network is managed by the VCF, which also owns 80% of the captive bearded vultures. All partners follow and respect the best practice guidelines for captive-breeding bearded vultures developed over the years.
The goal of this international captive breeding program (EEP) is the conservation in situ of the species, using the produced nestlings as a base basis for reintroduction projects approved by the VCF/EEP. And the VCF’s final goal is to restore the species across its former range in Europe and establish a European Bearded Vulture meta-population, connecting the current extant isolated populations (Pyrenees, Corsica and Crete) with the reintroduced populations (The Alps, The Massif Central, Andalusia, in a continuum that extends from northern Africa (Morocco) to Asia (Turkey & the Caucasus).

Our strength is our network and strategy

The Bearded vulture European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) is an International captive breeding program which started in 1978. This program is composed by a large number of different types of institutions: private and municipal Zoos, private collectors, NGO’s, and Governmental recovery centers.
The Vulture Conservation Foundation is the leading partner of this group, gives technical support to all organizations, defines the strategy and the guidelines of the EEP.
Since the beginning the objectives of this programme were clear and are still valid today:-    to create and maintain a captive stock as a genetic reserve for the species-    to produce chicks which are able to reproduce as they reach adult age -    to establish a wild population, capable to survive and reproduce independently of human intervention.
Finally, with the VCF working at an European scale, the ultimate aim of the programme is to establish an European meta-population of Bearded Vultures, creating gene flow between the existing isolated autochthonous populations in Europe, linking the Alps, the Pyrenees, Corsica, and Crete to the populations in North Africa and Asia.
My main task as coordinator of the BV EEP is to achieve this established final goal: to create a European meta-population of Bearded Vultures. 
To reach this final goal it is necessary to assure the continuity of this captive breeding network and to provide young birds for all running reintroduction projects. We have not only to provide a certain number of chicks per year, we have also to provide the adequate birds for creating a human independent and self-sustainable wild population.
This requires a meticulous planning of pairing of birds and pair distribution inside the EEP, as well as adequately selecting the right nestling for each reintroduction project, following criteria on sex ratio and genetics.
Finally, to make sure that we are fomenting the development of natural behaviour in captive bred birds, we make sure all bearded vulture chicks are natural reared, with absolutely no human intervention in feeding or caring. This is done by adult birds only, either the parents of the chick or adoptive/foster parents. 
Thanks to all this work it was possible to increase the captive breeding network step by step and consequently the yearly number of produced chicks, making it possible to start new reintroduction projects. 
The key factor of all these successes is to know that pair formation in Bearded Vultures can be complicated and dangerous. That is why it was decided to create a distinction between centres dedicated exclusively to breeding (zoos and private centres) and centres dedicated to breeding and pair formation (Specialized Breeding Centres: SBCs). The role of the first is to house already established pairs and to breed the maximum number of offspring from them, while the specialized centers have specialized staff and are responsible for establishing new pairs, taking in new founders (injured birds from the wild), adopting chicks, housing problematic birds, and creating a genetic reserve by receiving specimens from all of the genetic lineages that make up the EEP.
Additionally a new technical assistance support service was created in 2013, giving all the partners the possibility to request the visit of a specialist on captive breeding of this species to receive suggestions on how to improve the facilities where their Bearded vultures are housed and consequently reduce the mortality of birds and increase breeding success at the zoos. More than half of the zoos have been visited by us during the last 5 years and have improved the aviary following our advice, showing a significantly increase of the average age of death of the birds.
All this effort made by all these partners makes possible that from an initial 40 birds, the captive population now has 174 birds, and a total yearly average production of around 25 chicks, assuring the continuity of all on-going reintroduction projects.
 
Risks and challenges
If we do not reach the fundraising goal, we will need to postpone some of the transports to another year, and still go through to the most urgent transports, namely the transfer of birds which need protection from disease.
If we exceed our initial fundraising goal, additional funds will go towards the building of new aviaries and improvement of current facilities at the Vallcalent Specialized Breeding Centre.
We hope you join us on this journey to bring the bearded vulture back to the European skies, from Western Spain to the Balkans!

Cited as the single, greatest candidate for a climate change sanctuary on the planet, the Sacred Headwaters ecosystem encompasses
 the pristine and un-roaded headwater ecosystems of the Skeena, Nass and
 Stikine rivers; three of Canada's most valuable wild salmon watersheds.
 The integrity of the Sacred Headwaters is essential to the long-term 
health of Northwest BC's entire wild salmon ecology and deeply 
influences the scope of climate change resiliency and adaptation for the
 region into the future. The Sacred Headwaters is rich with cultural heritage.
Every
 year, the Tahltan return to Beauty Camp to practice their culture and 
to pass on knowledge to children and grandchildren. They come together 
to pick berries and to hunt caribou, moose, and other wild game. They 
have a deep sense of responsibility to create enduring solutions that 
leverage regional ecosystem values, traditional knowledge and resilient 
communities to contribute to the global effort to adapt to a changing 
climate. 
For
 11 years the Klabona Keepers have been fighting to protect the Sacred 
Headwaters against harmful mining development and once more. BEYOND BOARDINGBeyond
 Boarding is a collective dedicated to spreading interest and passion 
for humanitarian and environmental activism within the outdoor 
community. Our goal is to encourage snowboarders, surfers and other 
self-propelled athletes to channel the positive energy inherent to our 
sports in ways that genuinely help the people and environment in our

<p><b><u>What are bat boxes and why are they important?</u></b></p>
<p>Bat boxes provide
a safe space for bats to roost, and provide a habitat for female bats to raise
their young. Loss of habitat is a common issue facing bats today. Developments
are destroying roosting grounds and interrupting flying routes, and human
activity can interrupt hibernation and the raising of bat pups. Through bat
boxes these creatures have a much higher chance of avoiding human activity.
Also, female bats often give birth to only one pup at a time. This slow
reproduction rate makes it very important to offer bats a safe habitat. One of
my bat boxes can hold up to 400 bats.<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445559271/vgydswrlkfpfb91cnybt.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 292.826px; height: 390px;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445559332/ibhfagf1rmhkndg8cehw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b><u>How does the DEEP use bat boxes?</u></b></p>
<p>  The
DEEP uses bat boxes to relocate unwanted colonies. These colonies are located
in people’s homes, garages, barns, or other unwanted areas. After the bats
migrate in the fall, or before they arrive in the spring, the DEEP will install
these bat boxes in the area where a nuisance colony was located. The structure
in which the bats used to live will be sealed so they can’t get back in. This
system creates a perfect situation for the bats and humans. The bats still have
a place to live, and the people don’t have to worry about the bats bothering

Located in the heart of South America, Paraguay rests at the
meeting point of some of the continent's most diverse and ecologically striking
regions.  Home to over 700 bird species, impressive wetlands, tropical
forests, and great swaths of the Gran Chaco, the country faces a unique set of
challenges in preserving its incredible biodiversity and working toward a
sustainable future.
During the last decade, Paraguay has had the second-highest deforestation rate in the world, with millions of hectares of habitat converted for human use, threatening
many native species with extinction.  Air pollution and mismanagement of
waste are also among the environmental problems that the country faces.
Protecting the country's vast natural wealth and promoting environmental responsibility
will be great challenges for the next generation.El
Desafío:
Situado en el corazón de América del Sur, Paraguay está ubicado en el punto de encuentro de unas de las regiones más
diversas y ecológicas más impresionantes del continente. El hogar de más de 700
especies de aves, humedales, bosques tropicales, y andanas grandes del Gran
Chaco, el país se enfrente a una serie de desafíos en la preservación de su increíble biodiversidad y trabajando hacia un futuro sostenible.
Durante la última década, Paraguay tenía la segunda tasa más alta de deforestación en el mundo, millones de hectáreas de hábitats han sido convertidos para el uso humano, amenazando especies nativas en peligro de
extinción. Contaminación del aire a gran escala y el mal manejo de residuos
han disminuido aún más la calidad de vida y han creado un estado de
desequilibrio para los biomas naturales. La protección de la casta riqueza del país y la promoción de la responsabilidad ambiental serán grandes retos para la próxima generación. The
Opportunity:



Paraguay is an environmentally rich nation, and perhaps one of its
best resources is its young people. With over half of the population under the
age of 25, Paraguayan youth are shaping the future of their country and its
impact on the world. Through education focused on environmental consciousness
and responsibility, tangible skills, and project-building tools, Paraguay's next generation can be inspired to address the
environmental challenges both present and future.La
Oportunidad:
Paraguay es un país rico
con el medio ambiente, y quizás uno de sus mejores recursos es su gente joven.
Con más de la mitad de la población menor de 25 años, la juventud paraguaya
están dando forma al futuro de su país y su impacto en el mundo. A través de la
educación centrada en la conciencia ambiental y la responsabilidad, habilidades
tangibles, y las herramientas de creación de proyecto, la próxima generación de
Paraguay puede estar inspirada para hacer frente a los retos ambientales
actuales y futuros.The
Plan:


This February, A Todo Pulmón Paraguay Respira, in partnership with Peace Corps/Paraguay, will host the
fifth ""Paraguay Verde"" National Youth Camp. A Todo Pulmón, a Paraguayan non-profit organization, operates on a national level, raising environmental awareness and facilitating local reforestation projects to improve Paraguayan quality of life.
Paraguay Verde will bring together over 100 participants from across the nation, giving them the opportunity to learn about
environmental challenges, share ideas and experiences, and collaborate on
solutions for each of their communities. The camp provides a national platform
for young Paraguayans to discuss local issues and share strategies for
addressing them in a fun and empowering atmosphere. Youth then return to their communities capable of initiating or enhancing environmental youth groups and implementing sustainable action plans.
El
Plan:
A Todo Pulmón: Paraguay Respira junto
con Cuerpo de Paz Paraguay organizará el quinto Campamento Juvenil Nacional ""Paraguay Verde"" en febrero del 2015. A Todo Pulmón, una asociación paraguaya sin fines de lucro, opera a nivel nacional concienciando sobre temas ambientales y facilitando proyectos de reforestación locales para mejorar la calidad de vida Paraguaya. 
Paraguay Verde juntará más de 100 participantes de todo el país dando a paraguayos jóvenes la oportunidad de aprender
sobre los desafíos ambientales, compartir ideas y experiencias, y colaborar en
soluciones para cada una de sus comunidades. El campamento ofrece una
plataforma nacional para paraguayos jóvenes para discutir sobre cuestiones locales y
compartir estrategias y soluciones en un ambiente divertido y empoderado. Luego, los jóvenes vuelven a
sus comunidades siendo capaces de iniciar o mejorar grupos ambientales de jóvenes e
implementar planes de acción sostenibles.

<p>In 1989, my father bought a big piece of land in the northeast part of Costa Rica, to invest in the wood market: 2000 acres of tropical rainforest, including 1400 of primary forest. Little by little, he and my mother started to build a ranch, some rooms, a kitchen... until it became my family's vacation property.</p>
<p>In 2001, with the help of biologist friends of the family, Jill Prutz and Thomas LaDuke, it became what is now, a biology field station, preserving more than 2000 acres of authentic tropical forest and all of its wildlife.</p>
<p>We named it <strong>El Zota Biological Field Station.</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the years, the station has been growing, receiving students from universities all around the world, who help to research native plants, various species of insects, monkeys (we have howler monkey, spider monkey and white-faced monkey) and all kinds of scientific investigations and biology research.</p>
<p>El Zota shelters more than 400 species of birds, 116 species of bats, 40 different rodents, more than 25 mammals, including the jaguar and the tapir, and uncountable species of trees and flowers. El Zota is located in a very important spot for the Costa Rica's biology research, located next to Barra del Colorado National Park and Tortuguero National Park.</p>

Focusing on a corner lot in one of North Philadelphia's poorest neighborhoods, we are working towards building and maintaining a mini-farm to serve the community. It will not only provide fresh crops for the surrounding residents, but will also beautify the neglected land. We are focusing on potatoes because of the simplicity in maintaining these crops. 

The Impact
The development of a mini-farm will provide:
-Members of the community with a food source
-Clean community green space
-Youth agricultural education opportunities


What We Need & What You Get
So far we have received:
-Permission to use the land
-Lumber for the garden beds

<p><strong>About Me</strong> Three years ago I landed in Bangkok, tired from a really long flight from Canada, worried about how I was going to get out of the airport with all my baggage/field equipment, and feeling very aware of the fact that I was completely alone on the other side of the world. Armed with some research equipment, a video camera, and a solid pair of hiking boots, I had arrived in Thailand to begin my PhD research and was moving into the jungle to study primates at UNESCO World Heritage Site, Khao Yai National Park. It was the start of my biggest adventure to date.<br/>The for next two years I would live with Thai locals as the only foreign researcher in one of Thailand’s largest, and most celebrated, protected rainforests. And relying only on the kindness of strangers, I had to learn the local language fast and figure out how things worked to make new friends in order to survive so far away from home.<br/>I documented my journey in this blog (<a href=""http://www.blogpsot.com/primejm"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.prime-jm.blogspot.com</a>) for my friends and family to read, but soon the blog grew into a more meaningful enterprise. An audience was building of students and interested readers looking to learn more about the animals I study, my relationships with the Thai locals in a foreign culture, and my experiences with nature.</p>
<p>In a nutshell: it was the best experience of my life and I'm so thankful so many people were interested to hear about my adventures!!<br/>When I finished my research and returned home from Thailand at the end of 2011, I knew things couldn’t end there. I had to do more. More people need experiences like mine to gain perspective of themselves and find their place in the world; more opportunities needed to be available for young adults to experience other ways of life and consider the essential interrelatedness of humans and nature. And most importantly, I had to find a way to give back to the local communities and people who, though they had very little themselves to give, enriched my life and shared with me all that they had, taking care of me while I lived so very far away from home for so long.<br/>And so, I initiated the Jackie Prime Project (<a href=""http://www.jackieprime.org"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.jackieprime.org</a>).</p>
<p><strong><strong>The Project</strong> </strong>The main purpose of the Jackie Prime Project is to create opportunities for young adults to experience other cultures and live in nature, developing their skills of compassion, self-value/confidence and empathy, and to educate people about the interconnectedness of humans and nature. <br/>With the help of a few of my friends and dedicated student volunteers, I have created an enthusiastic group of peers to help me build my vision and share it with others. We believe that knowledge of the connections between humans and nature through active participation in the world fosters harmony, empathy for others, and globally responsible individuals.</p>
<p>We're still a small group, but with your support we can create opportunities for other students to venture outside the classroom and experience the world first hand in a fun, safe, and educational way.</p>

<p><b>Who are we?</b></p>
<p>CDS
(Conservation and sustainable development) belong to a small non-governmental
organization that facilitates environmental education and research in the
Amazonian cloud forest of Peru. Our team is collaboration between international
scientists, including three Ph.D biologists and a Mg. Educator, people from the
local town of Oxapampa and volunteers from around the globe; all of whom are
committed to the regeneration the natural environment using clean and
sustainable energy. The day to day running of the center is overseen by our Director
Dr. Florencia Trama, accompanied by her 2 year old son Lorenzo.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Where are we?</b></p>
<p>The CDS center is located in the buffer zone
of the Oxapampa, Ashaninka, and Yanesha UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. CDS is
surrounded by 15.5 hectares of cloud forest, two streams, riparian forest, a
reforested area, and cultivation areas with local fruit crops. The Oxapampa,
Ashaninka, Yanesha UNESCO Biosphere Reserve encompasses 18,673.79 hectares
(4,614,394 Acres) of primary and secondary forest from 300 – 4500 meters above
sea level (984-14,763 feet above sea level).</p>
<p><b>What do we do?</b></p>
<p>With the
help of our national and international volunteers we have founded an
environmental education center in the high cloud forest of the Amazonian (Conservation
and Sustainable Development/Conservación y Desarrollo Sostenible CDS), where we
are implementing a range of sustainable projects in order to teach and lead by
example.</p>
<p>There are a
number of projects at the center: </p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Environmental
education courses for university students </p>

<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Using

<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Using
recycled materials to construct facilities at the center </p>
<p><b>Our volunteers</b></p>
<p>Our
national and international volunteers are a vital part of the center. A diverse
range of people from all around the world travel to the center to become a part
of our team.</p>
<p>Our
volunteers both live and work in the center. We endeavour to make all aspects
of life at <u>CDS</u> as sustainable as possible, as such we have dry
composting toilets, all food waste is used to form compost, and all packaging
is used around the center wherever practical. In addition to the greenhouse, we
are also planning to make a new set of bathrooms using plastic bottles and recycled
materials. </p>
<p>Currently a
gasoline powered generator is used to fulfil the basic energy requirements of
our volunteers whilst they are living at the center – such as charging laptops
on which to complete reports or charging batteries for flashlights. With access
to the necessary funds, we aim to eradicate the need to use gasoline. The small
hydroelectric generator will sufficiently provide clean and sustainable energy
that we can generate ourselves.</p>
<p><b>Courses at the center</b></p>
<p>Education
courses are held at the center for groups of up to 35 students from Universidad
Peruana Cayetano Heredia and other institutions. Our team lectures and provides
practical sessions on a number of important topics including: plants,
amphibians, insects, birds, mammals and sampling methods, all of which are
crucial for the continued preservation of the area. We also have to rely upon
the gasoline generator during the course in order to facilitate the needs of 35
students.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How can we improve CDS and how can you help?</b></p>
<p>To maximise
the efficiency and sustainability of our efforts at the CDS centre, we must
produce our own clean energy; renewable energy that will power the basic needs
of the volunteers and the projects. In order to go completely off-grid and be
independently sustainable, we need to implement a small, localised
hydroelectric power system. By utilizing one of the rivers existent at the center,
the natural flow of the water can be transformed in to clean energy with
minimal impact on our environment. The total cost of the hydroelectric project
is $26,500 USD. A small amount compared with the invaluable worth of the forest,
but unfortunately a sum that is currently out of reach, as the center is
personally funded by the CDS team.</p>
<p>If we are
able to successfully implement this project we will be the first “energetically
sustainable” education and practical training center for conservation and
sustainable development in the Oxapampa, Ashaninka, Yanesha, UNESCO biosphere
reserve. </p>
<p>Access to
these funds would greatly aid our efforts to regenerate the cloud forest and
implement our projects in the most environmentally friendly and sustainable way
possible. </p>
<p><b>Renewable energy</b></p>
<p>The process
of becoming energetically independent requires four steps: </p>
<p><span>1.<span>  </span></span>Request a government permit to
legally sequester water from the river</p>
<p>Cost of permit = $1,400</p>
<p><span>2.<span>  </span></span>Evaluate the property to establish
the most suitable catchment site in the river</p>
<p>Cost of evaluation = $7,500</p>
<p><span>3.<span>  </span></span>Design a hydroelectric system with
maximum efficiency </p>
<p>Designing the system will cost $3,700</p>
<p><span>4.<span>  </span></span>Construct the hydroelectric system</p>
<p>Constructing the system requires several separate pieces of equipment.
Firstly, we must construct a water channel with a length of 1000 m to lead
water from the river to the CDS site. </p>
<p>The channel will be made using cement and stones, the cost of materials
and labour amounting to $2,500 USD</p>
<p>Secondly, it is necessary to construct a reservoir where the water will
pool. We will create the reservoir with concrete and the cost for materials and
labour is $ 4,500 USD. Lastly, we will install the system including the turbine
($ 5700) and the generator ($ 1,200). The turbine will be moved by the water
and produce clean energy for the center using a generator.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Our recompenses</b><br/></p>

Oxapampa, Perú. By Stefany Salcedo and Florencia Trama). The manual was
produced after two years of intensive research in the Oxapampa, Ashaninka,
Yanesha UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. It has more than 200 HQ pictures of aquatic
macroinvertebrates and information on their habitat, natural history and how they
can be of use as bio-indicators of riparian forest conditions. </p>

go a long way in helping to restore the beautiful cloud forest to its natural
state. </p>
<p>For $7500 you will receive an exclusive three
days tour of the Biosphere reserve of Oxapampa, visit our CDS center, the
Yanachaga Chemillén National Park which contains an abundance of flora and
fauna, and experience some of the local Oxapampa culture. The tour, which will
not include your ticket to and from Lima, will begin upon your arrival to Oxapampa
and will include: lodging at a traditional German (colonos) style lodge, locally produced and Food for the
duration of your stay, local transportation, and a visit to the renowned indigenous
community of Tsachopen, to explore their native style of living.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With the
generosity of our benefactors, our education center has the potential to create
a huge positive impact on our unique environment. By Leading and teaching by
example, we aim to use an entirely clean and sustainable source of energy, that
will allow us to be self-sufficient and carry out our regeneration activities
with minimal detrimental effects on the environment. Our pioneering education center
will be the first sustainable project of its kind in the biosphere reserve and
in the country.</p>
<p>We are
deeply grateful for all the support we receive, without which CDS would be
unable to have a positive impact on our much loved environment. Each
contribution will help us to preserve the magnificent cloud forest of Peru in a
sustainable way, and also allow us to teach the next generation of people how
to care for their environment.</p><p><br/></p><p>Credits of the video: <br/></p><p>3D animation for pelton turbine <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd5BN7SPkqI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd5BN7SPkqI</a></p><p><br/></p>

and will include: lodging at a traditional German (colonos) style lodge, locally produced and Food for the
duration of your stay, local transportation, and a visit to the renowned indigenous
community of Tsachopen, to explore their native style of living.

With the
generosity of our benefactors, our education center has the potential to create
a huge positive impact on our unique environment. By Leading and teaching by
example, we aim to use an entirely clean and sustainable source of energy, that
will allow us to be self-sufficient and carry out our regeneration activities
with minimal detrimental effects on the environment. Our pioneering education center
will be the first sustainable project of its kind in the biosphere reserve and
in the country.
We are
deeply grateful for all the support we receive, without which CDS would be
unable to have a positive impact on our much loved environment. Each
contribution will help us to preserve the magnificent cloud forest of Peru in a
sustainable way, and also allow us to teach the next generation of people how
to care for their environment.Credits of the video: 3D animation for pelton turbine https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd5BN7SPkqI",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Although most of the thick sludge of oil was soaked up using booms and large “diapers”, an unsightly sheen of diesel remained in the harbour, causing untold damage to marine life.</p><p>Every year, catastrophic oil disasters hit the headlines……..the explosion of BP’s Deepwater Horizon platform in the Gulf of Mexico released millions of litres of oil per day…the Exxon Valdez spilled over 40 million litres of oil into Prince William Sound, off the Alaska coast and we have seen oil spewed into our oceans from dozens of collisions, explosions, storms and blowouts. Each incident has been devastating both for marine wildlife and those coastal communities whose livelihoods depend on the bounty of the ocean ( <i>Suzuki, Moola, “Oil addictions” June 2010</i>)</p><p>BUT DID YOU KNOW…..??? <i>Each year the equivalent amount of oil as the Exxon Valdez disaster is spilled into our oceans, marinas, streams and waterways from every day runoff from our infrastructures, dirty bilges of commercial vessels, spills at fuel docks, badly maintained boats and ships and accidental sinking of vessels.</i> ( <i>Suzuki, Moola, “Oil addictions” June 2010</i>)</p><p>JUST IMAGINE…….<i>if you dripped a quarter of a teaspoon of oil into a five gallon bucket of water each day for a year …..how dirty do you think that water would be after 365 days?</i></p><p>BC’s waters are pristine and productive. They support Canada’s west coast seafood industry, and tourism sector, so the current oil spill and pollution prevention and<br/>response systems are unacceptable…not only for First Nation’s culture and<br/>heritage, but for all of us who are dependent economically on our waterways,<br/>and who care deeply about our environment, and preserving it for future<br/>generations.</p><p>In 2013, the Provincial government commissioned a U.S. consultant company, Nuka Research and Planning Group, to review the current oil spill prevention and response regime on the west coast of British Columbia.  The three reports outline<br/>recommendations and considerations for BC to move towards a “World Class<br/>System”.  Reviewing these documents, we were struck by the observation that most of the major progress that has been made in oil spill prevention, preparedness and response, in North America and worldwide, has been catalyzed by a major oil spill. </p><p>The oil spill response capacity for British Columbia is heavily focused on the Southern BC area mainly in Vancouver and Juan de Fuca Strait. The report highlighted that other areas of BC coast are extremely vulnerable to oil spills and pollution, not only from a major disaster, but from the type of “minor” incident that Bob<br/>Elliott witnessed at Ladysmith Harbour, seven years ago.</p><p>Bob Elliott is a member of Cowichan Tribes, and for generations, fish and other seafood have been the mainstay of his family and community’s existence and culture.

They can also be stationed at “high risk” sites, such as the remote coastal communities of British Columbia, which cannot be reached over 75% of the time by existing oil response vessels in the event of a disaster, due to the inclement weather.<br/></p><p>First Nations and their individual culture are linked with the resources along our vast coastline and across our lands.  They are a people linked to the water and the land and have the experience to work on it.  The ocean is their highway to their fishing<br/>grounds, to their neighbours, and to connect to other coastal cities and<br/>towns.  They also play a role in dealing with at sea incidents by towing boats back to port and assisting at sea rescues, such as the grounding of the BC Ferry “Queen of the North”, by tending to the passengers in the lifeboats immediately after the incident, and later assisting Canadian Coast Guard.  Because of their proximity to the ocean they can respond more quickly to any incident that may occur. The same is true for the Nations living in the remote territories across Canada where they can respond quickly to any accident on land and in the fresh waterways.</p><p>We believe First Nations can play a much larger role in the<br/>protection of our marine environment and keeping our waterways clean and safe.</p><p><b><i>Our campaign is to devise a program to support a First Nations Coastal<br/>Community in developing their own oil spill response capacity in their own<br/>territory.  This proposal is designed initially as a pilot project, which will be the basis of a “blueprint” for oil response systems for all Coastal communities.</i></b><br/></p><p>Our approach in developing this pilot project is to follow the Norwegian contingency system.<span>  Basically the regions or communities are empowered with equipment (see<br/>below) and training to respond immediately to an oil spill, rather than wait<br/>for a company to respond.  The Canadian federal response planning standard of 72 hours for a spill up to 10,000t for Vancouver and much longer to reach remote areas is not acceptable.</span></p><p>The advantages for using B.E.S.T equipment are:</p><p><span>Ø </span><i>The equipment is portable and easy to use.<span>  </span></i></p><p><span>Ø<span> </span></span><i>Can be towed to either marine or inland freshwater systems.</i></p><p><span>Ø </span><i>Because of portability difficult coastal inlets can be reached.</i></p><p><span>Ø<span> </span></span><i>Very effective to retrieve various grades of oil and including sheen.</i></p><p><span>Ø </span><i>Coastal communities will be able to <b>work independently </b>on inland waterways pollution with the same equipment across all territories. </i></p><p><span>Ø<span>  </span></span><i>Communities <b>working together</b> with a Marine Oil Response Company and<br/>CCG on ocean and coastal spills.</i></p><p>Our proposed response capacity (number of units and their response time) for the pilot community will consist of the provision of oil recovery units, the coordination an oil response team in the community, training to operate the units and additional training for vessel operation and at sea rescue, and coordination with Canada Coast<br/>Guard.<span>  The community’s oil response team will monitor vessel traffic and report any incidence in their territory to a command centre.</span></p><p>There will be an immediate response to any type of spill, large or small.<br/></p><p><b>The Equipment</b></p><p>Over the last three years, Bob Elliott has invested over $100,000 and countless hours into the research and development of the Ace Curtain skimmer and other configurations of the same technology (patent pending)</p><strong><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/429665/files/20140312184349-BC882.bmp?1394675029"" src="""" style=""""/></p></strong><p><br/> </p><p>The Ace Curtain Skimmer is a light oil sheen oil skimmer<br/>with 40 rotating heads and carbon fiber skimmer belting.

We intend to use our marathon as a platform to gather eyeballs and hearts to raise awareness and further donations for both Save The Rhino, an organisation dedicated to global Rhino conservation and Cool Earth, a global company dedicated to protecting the Amazon rain forest. When we say our ""marathon"" we're referring to the Rickshaw Run, a massive event held in India every year where teams from around the world travel the length of the country in a tuk tuk in support of various causes. Every team participating in the marathon has been given a donation target to reach for Cool Earth and another charity/cause of their choosing.
We chose Rhino conservation because we see it as an urgent global issue needing our immediate attention and support. The more people know about it, the more change we can hope spark. 
The video carries a fun tone because we do intend to have fun. But that isn't our only intention. All three of us believe that our talents and efforts are best used when contributing to a better world.
Your support for our adventure will help us get to India to participate in the race and begin making noise about the need to save our Rhinos.



The perks!
The perks are simple. For your donation of 5 to 10 dollars you get our love and eternal gratitude. And ,of course, you will have the peace of mind knowing you helped efforts to protect a dying species and earth's largest rain forest.
Higher perks buy you a special message sticker on our Tuk Tuk. Include the message in your comments when buying the perk, or send us your logo. Make your mark and show your support on Jemima!

Rhino Conservation





In 2012, 668 rhinos were killed for their horns in South Africa alone. The horns are sold on the black market for utterly useless medicinal purposes.
This year alone more than 500 South African Rhinos have been murdered - many of them mothers with calves or even unborn babies.
We’re doing the marathon in an effort to raise awareness about rhino conservation.

But in India? Really? How do our intentions to
raise funds for the protection of South Africa's Rhinos align with
anything to do with India? Well protection of any species is of
global concern when you think about it. We all represent the same
species now don't we? And if we can't protect one species then
all are at threat. 



Sure, but how does going to India help

The Amazon - CoolEarth.org
Every minute 100 acres of forest are cleared. the amazon provides 20% of the world’s fresh water and oxygen. rain forest destruction cause as much carbon emmissions as the entire USA - some six billion tonnes per year. in 24 hours deforestation will create as much co2 gas as 8 million people flying from london to new york.
So, what Cool Earth does is protect the rainforest by placing donated money into local trusts to ensure that local people living in the rainforest become legal custodians of the land,protect the forest form any illegal logging via ground rangers and satellite imagery, and strategic placement of people and protection plans to prevent loggers, oil miners and cattle farmers from breaching into larger areas.

This, taken from the initiative’s website, says it all: “With a pounding heart of 145.45cc pushing 7hp of raw power to three tiny wheels, the humble auto-Rickshaw is a feat of non-engineerance.

<h3>A quick introduction to the desert kit fox project</h3>
<p>I'm Dipika Kadaba, a graduate student at Duke University. During my internship at the Center for Biological Diversity in the Summer of 2012, I worked on a petition to list the desert kit fox as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act. While writing the petition, I realised there were large gaps in the literature - specifically, baseline information about numbers of foxes. These gaps led to the petition being rejected by California state authorities. The Desert Kit Fox Project was born of the need for baseline data about this population, and ideas sparked by graduate coursework in innovative non-invasive wildlife monitoring techniques. </p>
<p>Desert kit foxes (<em>Vulpes macrotis arsipus</em>), are a diminutive subspecies of kit fox that are found in arid regions. Very little is known about their population in California, and their desert habitat in the state is facing numerous growing threats from human development. In 2012, foxes in and around a solar energy project began dying from a stress-induced disease outbreak.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5045/5265312790_a7b871d4fc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><strong>A desert kit fox, by Ben Smith</strong><br/><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/17421030@N03/5265312790/in/photostream/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Source</a></p>
<p><br/>This summer I aim to study where desert kit foxes occupy available habitat, and how the landscape, vegetation, prey species, and human disturbance affects them. </p>
<p><br/>The two things that set this study apart from a conventional survey is the use of a low-cost quadcopter drone to perform rapid aerial surveys, and the recording of desert kit fox footprints for the purpose of developing an identification algorithm for the species. All the techniques we develop are designed to be adaptable to other desert species, and we will also generate data that is informative about the entire desert ecosystem. </p>
<p>Another motivating factor behind my decision to involve crowdfunding and social media in my research was to share this experience with people in my life, connect with new people who share my love for the natural world, and finally, to make full use of being a scientist who lives and works in the age of the internet. Thank you for being a part of this project. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need and What You Get<span style=""font-size: 10px;""> </span>
</h3>
<p>1) We need help buying equipment! If you sponsor a specific item by claiming it as a perk, we will send it to you after we use it (as gently as possible!) through the summer. The cost of sponsoring equipment is calculated by adding the cost of the unit, tax, shipping costs to us and to you, and indiegogo's fees. <strong>GPS Units</strong>, a<strong> GoPro</strong>, and<strong> a terrifyingly awesome quadcopter drone</strong> can be claimed in this way. Who doesn't already have drones on their shopping list? Buy one and support a great cause! (Or, if you have used equipment that you can lend us for the duration of the project, get in touch!)<br/>EQUIPMENT DISCLAIMER: Equipment will be used as carefully as possible, and they might bear some signs of use in their line of duty. On the off chance that the equipment fails and becomes non-functional, we will send you a new unit.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>2) We also need money for non-returnable expenses like scent bait, materials to build track plate stations, camping equipment, and a 4WD rental + gas for difficult terrain. This is where the main perks come in.</p>
<p><strong> Wristbands:</strong> A 100% silicone eco-friendly wristband that reads ""The Desert Kit Fox Project"". Sport your support for the project, and start conversations about the desert's most charming canine. </p>
<p><strong>Postcards</strong>: We'll post you a desert themed postcard with a handwritten message of thanks, to remind you of that time you supported desert kit fox research and how your biologist buddies fended off heatstroke in the desert summer. </p>
<p><strong>Photo prints:</strong> As we survey and make our way through the Sonoran desert landscape, we'll be photographing the landscape, our exploits, and desert critters - including aerial shots taken from the drone, and discrete camera trap stills. We'll put up a gallery of all our best shots, and we'll send you a photo print of your favorite one. Don't forget to include your e-mail address!</p>
<p><strong>T-shirts:</strong> (My personal favorite!) A gray cotton t-shirt with the official project logo.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/PVualVr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><strong>Project logo, </strong>designed by graphic artist <a href=""http://chackosan.blogspot.in"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>chackosan.blogspot.in</span></a></p>
<p>Access this chart to choose your size: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/R7SYuVy.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Size Chart</a> (XXLs and larger are available too, they just don't show up on the chart)</p>
<p>Wear your love for desert kit foxes, and if you run into one of us, we'll be t-shirt buddies. </p>
<p><strong>Track casts and plates:</strong> We'll be laying out powdered contact paper and sanded track plates to capture desert critter footprints to enumerate them and record the prints. We'll also be stumbling across footprints in the wild. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/Rt853wb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><strong>Desert Tracks</strong></p>
<p>We'll send you a plaster cast and track paper pair so you can keep a piece of the wild with you, without taking anything from it. If you're familiar with the Sonoran desert and have a species you're fond of, let us know and we'll reserve it for you if we find it!</p>
<p><strong>Camping trips:</strong> Come spend time with us! We want to spend time with you. Spot desert critters with us as we work, and at night, lie back under the desert sky and watch the universe expand. </p>
<p><strong>Funder recognition:</strong> Be a Desert Kit Fox Project godparent. We'll love you for it and acknowledge your contribution in all publications that the project generates. Plus everything else we can give you.</p>
<p>All contributions earn our undying gratitude.</p>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Current management of the desert kit fox is entirely inadequate to monitor and prevent population declines due to the range of current and emerging threats to this subspecies. The listing petition discusses the threats in detail for 30 pages. </p>
<p><strong>The expected results of the study are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Desert kit fox occupancy levels, i.e. how frequently they occupy habitat that is available to them.   </li>
<li>How landscape features, vegetation communities and cover, prey species numbers and compositions, and human disturbance like signs of vehicles and debris affects desert kit fox occupancy levels, as well as the correlations between all these elements themselves. </li>
</ul>
<p>These ecological data provide an important baseline for further studies on the species, and also aids evidence-based decisions about the management and conservation of desert kit foxes and their habitat. </p>
<p>The desert kit fox can serve as an important umbrella species in their desert ecosystem as they are wide-ranging and their habitat requirements include those of many other species, i.e. creosote scrub bush dwelling animals such as the desert tortoise, burrowing owl, mohave ground squirrel, and others.</p>
<p><strong>The broader impacts of this study include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Development of a low cost, low altitude, quadcopter drone for aerial surveys. The use of drones for conservation is ripe for development as technology comes of age. The quadcopter that we will use can autonomously follow waypoints that are programmed using autopilot software, while it carries a video camera payload. This involves many firsts - the use of drones for this species and this ecosystem, and the first use of a quadcopter for wildlife conservation research to the best of our knowledge. Drones are not often used for conservation in the US due to FAA regulations, so the system that we develop within the regulations can serve as a useful reference for other researchers. The manufacturer of the drone, 3D robotics, maintain open source technology which allows us to keep the cost of the drone as low as possible.

</div></div>","A quick introduction to the desert kit fox project
I'm Dipika Kadaba, a graduate student at Duke University. During my internship at the Center for Biological Diversity in the Summer of 2012, I worked on a petition to list the desert kit fox as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act. While writing the petition, I realised there were large gaps in the literature - specifically, baseline information about numbers of foxes. These gaps led to the petition being rejected by California state authorities. The Desert Kit Fox Project was born of the need for baseline data about this population, and ideas sparked by graduate coursework in innovative non-invasive wildlife monitoring techniques. 
Desert kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis arsipus), are a diminutive subspecies of kit fox that are found in arid regions. Very little is known about their population in California, and their desert habitat in the state is facing numerous growing threats from human development. In 2012, foxes in and around a solar energy project began dying from a stress-induced disease outbreak.

This summer I aim to study where desert kit foxes occupy available habitat, and how the landscape, vegetation, prey species, and human disturbance affects them. 
The two things that set this study apart from a conventional survey is the use of a low-cost quadcopter drone to perform rapid aerial surveys, and the recording of desert kit fox footprints for the purpose of developing an identification algorithm for the species. All the techniques we develop are designed to be adaptable to other desert species, and we will also generate data that is informative about the entire desert ecosystem. 
Another motivating factor behind my decision to involve crowdfunding and social media in my research was to share this experience with people in my life, connect with new people who share my love for the natural world, and finally, to make full use of being a scientist who lives and works in the age of the internet. Thank you for being a part of this project. 
 
What We Need and What You Get 

1) We need help buying equipment! If you sponsor a specific item by claiming it as a perk, we will send it to you after we use it (as gently as possible!) through the summer. The cost of sponsoring equipment is calculated by adding the cost of the unit, tax, shipping costs to us and to you, and indiegogo's fees. GPS Units, a GoPro, and a terrifyingly awesome quadcopter drone can be claimed in this way. Who doesn't already have drones on their shopping list? Buy one and support a great cause! (Or, if you have used equipment that you can lend us for the duration of the project, get in touch!)EQUIPMENT DISCLAIMER: Equipment will be used as carefully as possible, and they might bear some signs of use in their line of duty. On the off chance that the equipment fails and becomes non-functional, we will send you a new unit.


2) We also need money for non-returnable expenses like scent bait, materials to build track plate stations, camping equipment, and a 4WD rental + gas for difficult terrain. This is where the main perks come in.
 Wristbands: A 100% silicone eco-friendly wristband that reads ""The Desert Kit Fox Project"". Sport your support for the project, and start conversations about the desert's most charming canine. 
Postcards: We'll post you a desert themed postcard with a handwritten message of thanks, to remind you of that time you supported desert kit fox research and how your biologist buddies fended off heatstroke in the desert summer. 
Photo prints: As we survey and make our way through the Sonoran desert landscape, we'll be photographing the landscape, our exploits, and desert critters - including aerial shots taken from the drone, and discrete camera trap stills. We'll put up a gallery of all our best shots, and we'll send you a photo print of your favorite one. Don't forget to include your e-mail address!
T-shirts: (My personal favorite!) A gray cotton t-shirt with the official project logo.
Project logo, designed by graphic artist chackosan.blogspot.in
Access this chart to choose your size: Size Chart (XXLs and larger are available too, they just don't show up on the chart)
Wear your love for desert kit foxes, and if you run into one of us, we'll be t-shirt buddies. 
Track casts and plates: We'll be laying out powdered contact paper and sanded track plates to capture desert critter footprints to enumerate them and record the prints. We'll also be stumbling across footprints in the wild. 
Desert Tracks
We'll send you a plaster cast and track paper pair so you can keep a piece of the wild with you, without taking anything from it. If you're familiar with the Sonoran desert and have a species you're fond of, let us know and we'll reserve it for you if we find it!
Camping trips: Come spend time with us! We want to spend time with you. Spot desert critters with us as we work, and at night, lie back under the desert sky and watch the universe expand. 
Funder recognition: Be a Desert Kit Fox Project godparent. We'll love you for it and acknowledge your contribution in all publications that the project generates. Plus everything else we can give you.
All contributions earn our undying gratitude.
 


The Impact
Current management of the desert kit fox is entirely inadequate to monitor and prevent population declines due to the range of current and emerging threats to this subspecies. The listing petition discusses the threats in detail for 30 pages. 
The expected results of the study are:

Desert kit fox occupancy levels, i.e. how frequently they occupy habitat that is available to them.   
How landscape features, vegetation communities and cover, prey species numbers and compositions, and human disturbance like signs of vehicles and debris affects desert kit fox occupancy levels, as well as the correlations between all these elements themselves. 

These ecological data provide an important baseline for further studies on the species, and also aids evidence-based decisions about the management and conservation of desert kit foxes and their habitat. 
The desert kit fox can serve as an important umbrella species in their desert ecosystem as they are wide-ranging and their habitat requirements include those of many other species, i.e. creosote scrub bush dwelling animals such as the desert tortoise, burrowing owl, mohave ground squirrel, and others.
The broader impacts of this study include:

Development of a low cost, low altitude, quadcopter drone for aerial surveys. The use of drones for conservation is ripe for development as technology comes of age. The quadcopter that we will use can autonomously follow waypoints that are programmed using autopilot software, while it carries a video camera payload. This involves many firsts - the use of drones for this species and this ecosystem, and the first use of a quadcopter for wildlife conservation research to the best of our knowledge. Drones are not often used for conservation in the US due to FAA regulations, so the system that we develop within the regulations can serve as a useful reference for other researchers. The manufacturer of the drone, 3D robotics, maintain open source technology which allows us to keep the cost of the drone as low as possible.

The development of an identification algorithm for desert kit foxes based on the sand and paper tracks we capture, with the use of FIT - Footprint Identification Technology - by WildTrack.  FIT provides high levels of accuracy in identifying at the species, individual, age-class and sex levels. The creation of this algorithm will enable low cost non invasive population monitoring in the future. There's a lot of exciting things going on in the world of wildlife footprints; visit WildTrack at http://www.wildtrack.org/.

The project takes place June through August. If we do not reach our funding goal to purchase all the equipment, we will survey smaller areas with whatever methods are available to us (e.g. physical surveys, track plates, spotlighting.)

<p>
</p><p>We are a Colombian non-profit organization that
aims to protect an ancient forest that used to be an ecosystem full of life. </p>
<p>The oil exploitations, large-scale livestock and
monocultures have destroyed at least the 70% of the Colombian forest. </p>
<p>Local communities have realized the damage, but
their efforts seem not to be enough. </p>
<p>The government considers mining and oil
exploitation as part of the economic growth of the country. The Colombian
environmental laws are very flexible and in this regions represent a major risk
to the water and forest. </p>
<p>The negative impact on the environment is
overwhelming. Rivers have dried up, hundred of species have disappeared and the
problem goes on (<a href=""http://www.semana.com/seccion/nacion/muertos-de-sed-en-casanare/230-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.semana.com/seccion/nacion/muertos-de-sed-en-casanare/230-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent Colombian related news</a>).</p>
<p>With your help we will protect the forest for
the further generations. </p>
<p>This project seeks to protect and restore 121
hectares (298.9 acres) of forest.</p>
<p>However, if we raise more funds, we will
purchase the surrounding land that used to be part of the forest. In this way
we can restore what used to be a 1500 hectares (3700 acres) forest. </p>
<p>We deeply believe that human health depends on
the planet wellbeing. </p>
<p>Medicines, food and water depend on biodiversity.  Without the vastness biodiversity human’s
health will be condemned. </p>
<p>Literature has shown that vector transmitted diseases
like Malaria, Chagas, Dengue and Chikinguña have become endemic because of the
lost of the mosquito natural habitat and their natural predators such as frogs
and spiders.</p>
<p>New medicines development also depends on plants
and animals availability. Because of plants and animals extinction we have lost
the opportunity to find new medicine. </p>
<p>If we do not save this forest, it will be
extinguish. </p>
<p>Help us to give the forest one last chance. </p><p><a href=""#ingles"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Up</a></p><p><br/></p>

<p>80% of the budget will be committed to purchase
the land where the remaining forest, the river and the water sources are
located.</p>
<p>16% of the budget will be committed to plant and
restore 121 hectares (298.9 acres) with native flora. </p>
<p>2% of the budget will be committed to educational
purposes. We will build a small place base on permaculture principles (10
hectares, 25 acres) for workshops and community meetings. </p>

2% remaining of the budget will be used to pay
taxes, protection licenses and the first year maintenance of the natural
reserve.

<a name=""doingnow"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><p><b>WHAT
WE ARE DOING NOW?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>To make the Reserve comes true it will take at least five years, but we have
already started. </p>
<p>Today the reserve has 10 hectares (24 acres). Two hectares (4,94 acres) are
part of the remaining forest. </p>
<p>During
the past two years we had developed the <a href=""www.elcampus.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ElCampus.org</a><span>
project. El Campus is the first step for the reserve. We did the flora and
fauna inventory in order to show the world the species that lives in the
forest. We installed a ram (air pump, ariete) that uses the energy of the river
for water distribution. We delivered clean energy and biodiversity workshops
among the local community. We had planted many trees in order to protect the
water sources and restore the forest. We have received several volunteers who
have helped us to care for the land and build the seed house. We have done
advocacy in order to support the local community to promote laws that regulated
oil exploitation in the region. Please take a look of the <a href=""www.elcampus.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ElCampus.org</a> website to learn more about us and see
pictures.</span></p>
<p>Currently, we are now increasingly involving the community and local
authorities in the project so they can understand the benefits of protecting
the forest and natural resources.</p>
<p><a href=""#ingles"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Up</a></p><p><br/></p>
<a name=""challenges"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><p><b>MAIN
CHALLENGES</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>In Colombia the environmental laws are very flexible and in this regions
represent a major risk to the water and forest. The main challenge is to
purchase the surrounding lands in order to protect the all water sources and
forest. </p>
<p>Currently, we are now increasingly involving the community and local
authorities in the project so they can understand the benefits of protecting
the forest and natural resources.</p>
<p>The second challenge is sustainability. We have developed a network with
local schools and markets in order to establish a plan to sustain the reserve.
The main goal is to include the local government to protect and support the
area. </p>
<p>One of the main risk is that we cannot buy all the land where are the water
sources.  If we cannot protect the
surrounding land, we may face water pollution from distant sources that could affect
the animals in the reserve. </p>

At
the moment, the community and landowners have agreed to sell 121 hectares (298
acres) to the project.<br/>

</b></p><p>Somos una organización sin ánimo de lucro con sede en
Colombia que busca proteger un bosque antiguo que alberga diversos nacederos de
agua, cientos de animales y especies vegetales pero que se encuentra en
peligro. </p>
<p>La explotación petrolera, la ganadería y los cultivos a
gran escala han destruido por lo menos el 70% del bosque del oriente
Colombiano. </p>
<p>Las comunidades locales, en especial los abuelos que
conocieron los grandes ríos, se han dado cuenta del daño que se ha causado,
pero su lucha por detenerlo parece no ser suficiente. </p>
<p>Actualmente el Gobierno considera a la explotación
petrolera y la minería como parte del crecimiento económico del País y las
leyes Colombianas son demasiado flexibles, lo que representa un riesgo altísimo
para el agua y el bosque de esta región. </p>
<p>El impacto negativo en el ambiente de esta situación ha
sido contundente. Los ríos se han secado, miles de especies han desaparecido y
el problema continua (<a href=""http://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/un-dia-en-la-tragedia-ambiental-de-casanare/381714-3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ver noticias recientes</a>).
</p>
<p>Lo que antes era un corredor de bosque lleno de vida, es
ahora un ecosistema que agoniza. </p>
<p>Con tu ayuda estaremos protegiendo este corredor de
bosque, logrando así que las futuras generaciones y que la humanidad cuente con
un territorio más lleno de vida que estará protegido por siempre.</p>
<p>Este proyecto busca proteger y restaurar 121 hectáreas de
bosque. No obstante si logramos recoger más fondos, compraremos las tierras
vecinas que hacían parte de las 1500 hectáreas del bosque original. </p>
<p>Creemos profundamente que la salud del hombre depende del
bienestar del planeta así que debemos cuidarlo.</p>
<p>Las medicinas, la comida y el agua dependen de la
biodiversidad. Sin la vasta de biodiversidad la salud del hombre está
condenada. </p>
<p>Varios estudios han mostrado que la aparición de
epidemias de enfermedades trasmitidas por vectores como la Malaria, el Dengue,
la enfermedad de Chagas y la fiebre del Chikunguña, así como su aparición en
nuevas regiones, se debe a la pérdida del hábitat natural del mosquito y a la
desaparición de sus predadores naturales como las ranas y las arañas. </p>
<p>Del mismo modo el desarrollo de nuevos medicamentos, como
por ejemplo, la vincristina para el cáncer, depende de la biodiversidad y de la
supervivencia de especies animales y vegetales que hoy están amenazadas de
extinción.</p>
<p>No intentar salvar este bosque significaría condenarlo a
muerte. Sus especies, como el armadillo que vive en esta zona, se extinguirán y
las fuentes de agua restantes, como ha sucedido en esta misma región con otros
ríos, pronto se secaran.  </p>
<p>Ayúdanos a darle al bosque una última oportunidad. </p>

How can I help if I can't donate?
ABSTRACT

We are a Colombian non-profit organization that
aims to protect an ancient forest that used to be an ecosystem full of life. 
The oil exploitations, large-scale livestock and
monocultures have destroyed at least the 70% of the Colombian forest. 
Local communities have realized the damage, but
their efforts seem not to be enough. 
The government considers mining and oil
exploitation as part of the economic growth of the country. The Colombian
environmental laws are very flexible and in this regions represent a major risk
to the water and forest. 
The negative impact on the environment is
overwhelming. Rivers have dried up, hundred of species have disappeared and the
problem goes on (recent Colombian related news).
With your help we will protect the forest for
the further generations. 
This project seeks to protect and restore 121
hectares (298.9 acres) of forest.
However, if we raise more funds, we will
purchase the surrounding land that used to be part of the forest. In this way
we can restore what used to be a 1500 hectares (3700 acres) forest. 
We deeply believe that human health depends on
the planet wellbeing. 
Medicines, food and water depend on biodiversity.  Without the vastness biodiversity human’s
health will be condemned. 
Literature has shown that vector transmitted diseases
like Malaria, Chagas, Dengue and Chikinguña have become endemic because of the
lost of the mosquito natural habitat and their natural predators such as frogs
and spiders.
New medicines development also depends on plants
and animals availability. Because of plants and animals extinction we have lost
the opportunity to find new medicine. 
If we do not save this forest, it will be
extinguish. 
Help us to give the forest one last chance. Up
BUDGET

This project seeks to protect and restore 121
hectares (298.9 acres) of forest.
However, if we raise more funds, we will purchase
the surrounding land that used to be part of the forest. In this way we can
restore what used to be a 1500 hectares (3700 acres) forest. 
The funds will go to plant and restore 121
hectares (298.9 acres) of forest, purchase the lands that belong to private landowners,
and pay the fee to become a protected natural reserve. 
80% of the budget will be committed to purchase
the land where the remaining forest, the river and the water sources are
located.
16% of the budget will be committed to plant and
restore 121 hectares (298.9 acres) with native flora. 
2% of the budget will be committed to educational
purposes. We will build a small place base on permaculture principles (10
hectares, 25 acres) for workshops and community meetings. 

2% remaining of the budget will be used to pay
taxes, protection licenses and the first year maintenance of the natural
reserve.

WHAT
WE ARE DOING NOW?

To make the Reserve comes true it will take at least five years, but we have
already started. 
Today the reserve has 10 hectares (24 acres). Two hectares (4,94 acres) are
part of the remaining forest. 
During
the past two years we had developed the ElCampus.org
project. El Campus is the first step for the reserve. We did the flora and
fauna inventory in order to show the world the species that lives in the
forest. We installed a ram (air pump, ariete) that uses the energy of the river
for water distribution. We delivered clean energy and biodiversity workshops
among the local community. We had planted many trees in order to protect the
water sources and restore the forest. We have received several volunteers who
have helped us to care for the land and build the seed house. We have done
advocacy in order to support the local community to promote laws that regulated
oil exploitation in the region. Please take a look of the ElCampus.org website to learn more about us and see
pictures.
Currently, we are now increasingly involving the community and local
authorities in the project so they can understand the benefits of protecting
the forest and natural resources.
Up
MAIN
CHALLENGES

In Colombia the environmental laws are very flexible and in this regions
represent a major risk to the water and forest. The main challenge is to
purchase the surrounding lands in order to protect the all water sources and
forest. 
Currently, we are now increasingly involving the community and local
authorities in the project so they can understand the benefits of protecting
the forest and natural resources.
The second challenge is sustainability. We have developed a network with
local schools and markets in order to establish a plan to sustain the reserve.
The main goal is to include the local government to protect and support the
area. 
One of the main risk is that we cannot buy all the land where are the water
sources.  If we cannot protect the
surrounding land, we may face water pollution from distant sources that could affect
the animals in the reserve. 

At
the moment, the community and landowners have agreed to sell 121 hectares (298
acres) to the project.

RESUMEN DEL PROYECTO
Somos una organización sin ánimo de lucro con sede en
Colombia que busca proteger un bosque antiguo que alberga diversos nacederos de
agua, cientos de animales y especies vegetales pero que se encuentra en
peligro. 
La explotación petrolera, la ganadería y los cultivos a
gran escala han destruido por lo menos el 70% del bosque del oriente
Colombiano. 
Las comunidades locales, en especial los abuelos que
conocieron los grandes ríos, se han dado cuenta del daño que se ha causado,
pero su lucha por detenerlo parece no ser suficiente. 
Actualmente el Gobierno considera a la explotación
petrolera y la minería como parte del crecimiento económico del País y las
leyes Colombianas son demasiado flexibles, lo que representa un riesgo altísimo
para el agua y el bosque de esta región. 
El impacto negativo en el ambiente de esta situación ha
sido contundente. Los ríos se han secado, miles de especies han desaparecido y
el problema continua (ver noticias recientes).

Lo que antes era un corredor de bosque lleno de vida, es
ahora un ecosistema que agoniza. 
Con tu ayuda estaremos protegiendo este corredor de
bosque, logrando así que las futuras generaciones y que la humanidad cuente con
un territorio más lleno de vida que estará protegido por siempre.
Este proyecto busca proteger y restaurar 121 hectáreas de
bosque. No obstante si logramos recoger más fondos, compraremos las tierras
vecinas que hacían parte de las 1500 hectáreas del bosque original. 
Creemos profundamente que la salud del hombre depende del
bienestar del planeta así que debemos cuidarlo.
Las medicinas, la comida y el agua dependen de la
biodiversidad. Sin la vasta de biodiversidad la salud del hombre está
condenada. 
Varios estudios han mostrado que la aparición de
epidemias de enfermedades trasmitidas por vectores como la Malaria, el Dengue,
la enfermedad de Chagas y la fiebre del Chikunguña, así como su aparición en
nuevas regiones, se debe a la pérdida del hábitat natural del mosquito y a la
desaparición de sus predadores naturales como las ranas y las arañas. 
Del mismo modo el desarrollo de nuevos medicamentos, como
por ejemplo, la vincristina para el cáncer, depende de la biodiversidad y de la
supervivencia de especies animales y vegetales que hoy están amenazadas de
extinción.
No intentar salvar este bosque significaría condenarlo a
muerte. Sus especies, como el armadillo que vive en esta zona, se extinguirán y
las fuentes de agua restantes, como ha sucedido en esta misma región con otros
ríos, pronto se secaran.  
Ayúdanos a darle al bosque una última oportunidad.

bosque. No obstante, si logramos recoger más fondos, compraremos las tierras
vecinas que hacían parte de las 1500 hectáreas del bosque original.
Los fondos recolectados serán destinados para plantar y
restaurar 121 hectáreas de bosque, comprar las tierras que son parte del bosque
y pagar los impuestos para declarar la zona como reserva natural. 
El 80% del presupuesto será dedicado a comprar las
tierras vecinas que tienen bosque y los nacimientos de agua. 
El 16% del presupuesto será dedicado a la restauración
con árboles nativos y originarios de la zona. 
El 2% del presupuesto será dedicado a educación. Con base
en principios permaculturales construiremos salones para talleres. Estos
espacios se dedicaran a generar redes con la comunidad local y fomentar la
protección ambiental. 
El 2% restante se destinará a las licencias de
protección, impuestos, cuidado y mantenimiento de la reserva durante su primer
año.

¿QUÉ HEMOS HECHO Y QUÉ ESTAMOS HACIENDO?

Hacer realidad la reserva natural y proteger la tierra
tomará por lo menos 5 años. No obstante, ya hemos empezado. 
Actualmente la reserva cuenta con 10 hectáreas (24 acres)
de terrero, de las cuales 2 corresponden al núcleo del bosque. Tenemos dos
nacederos de agua, una porción de la quebrada y un terreno que corresponde a un
corredor natural de paso para animales como la nutria, los micos, los
armadillos y diversas aves. 
Desde hace dos años hemos venido trabajando en
desarrollar el proyecto llamado ElCampus.org. El Campus es el primer paso para
la reserva. Durante este tiempo realizamos el inventario de flora y fauna del
bosque para poder mostrarle al mundo las especies que viven en él.
Instalamos un ariete o bomba hidráulica que usa la energía de la quebrada para
distribuir el agua sin tener que usar gasolina. Dictamos talleres de energías
limpias y biodiversidad a las comunidades locales. Hemos plantado muchos
árboles para proteger los nacimientos de agua y restaurar el bosque. Hemos
recibido varios voluntarios que nos han ayudado a cuidar la tierra y construir
el semillero. Hemos apoyado a la comunidad local en la lucha para regular la
explotación petrolera en la región. Te invitamos a visitar la pagina web ElCampus.org
para que conozcas más del proyecto y puedas ver las fotos. 
Actualmente estamos involucrando más a la comunidad y a
las autoridades locales para que puedan entender los beneficios de proteger el
bosque y los recursos naturales. Volver
LOS PRINCIPALES RETOS
En Colombia las leyes ambientales son muy flexibles, lo que representa un gran riesgo para el agua y los bosques de esta región. El
reto principal es la compra de las tierras circundantes con el fin de proteger
a la todas las fuentes de agua y los bosques. En ese sentido estamos involucrando cada vez más a la
comunidad y a las autoridades locales en el proyecto, para que puedan entender los
beneficios de la protección de los bosques y los recursos naturales.
El segundo reto es la sostenibilidad. Actualmente hemos
desarrollado una red con las escuelas y los mercados locales con el fin de
establecer un plan para mantener la reserva. El objetivo principal consiste en
incluir al gobierno local para proteger y apoyar a la zona.
Uno de los principales riesgos es que no podamos comprar
todos los terrenos donde están las fuentes de agua. Si no podemos proteger
estas tierras circundantes, será difícil enfrentar los riesgos de contaminación del agua de
fuentes distantes que pueden afectar a los animales en la reserva.
Por el momento, la comunidad y los propietarios han
acordado la venta de 121 hectáreas (298 acres) al proyecto.

<p>Permaculture, spirit, and activism
- three very potent tools to regenerate our world.  I'm Starhawk, and I’m
the author of twelve books on the intersections of earth-based spirituality and
social change organizing, including my visionary novel <i>The Fifth Sacred Thing</i>. 
But I don’t just write about them, I try to practice them in my life and
in what I teach.</p>
<p>I started Earth Activist Training
because I wanted a program that could combine them all.  Permaculture is a
holistic ecological design system that includes powerful tools that can help us
heal damaged land, rebuild communities, and create truly sustainable
abundance.  We teach it with a
grounding in spirit—personal regeneration--and a focus on organizing and
activism.  In our permaculture
design course, students learn how to heal damaged soil, grow food organically,
bioremediate toxins, harvest water and re-use graywater, build low-cost,
low-carbon housing, and so many other skills.  And most of all, they learn how all the aspects of
sustainability can fit together so that we can meet our human needs while
caring for the natural systems around us. Permaculture offers solutions to some
of our most grave ecological problems.</p>
<p>The communities that most need
these tools are those who are on the front lines of environmental and social
struggles – our depressed inner cities, indigenous reserves where jobs and
resources are scarce, desertifying drylands and war-torn lands in the developing
world.  To share this knowledge, we
need to train people who come from those communities.  They are the best ambassadors and most effective teachers!</p>
<p>So Earth Activist Training offers
Diversity Scholarships to people of color who are working in environmental and
food justice.  From the urban food
deserts to the deserts of African, our students are doing amazing work!  They’re people like Menhuam Ayele, an
architecture student who is training former gang members to build a greenhouse
in San Francisco’s most depressed neighborhood.  Or Brandy Mack, who works with young girls who live in
public housing and helps them grow both food and self-esteem.  Or Tesfaye Johanson, who was born in
the Afar region of Ethiopia and now works to bring land and water programs in
his ancestral village.  Or David
Ortiz, a Blackfoot Nation permaculture designer who works for tribal water
rights.  Carmen Shorter helps women
make the transition from addiction and homelessness to treatment and next
steps.  Eighteen-year-old Ruby
Avila is developing gardens in her community.  Rushelle Frazier is an accomplished poet who is developing a
permaculture retreat center for Veterans.</p>
<p>You can meet them all in the video,
and by contributing to our campaign you can be part of their work, and others
like them. </p>
<p>These are the leaders and
visionaries who give me hope. I feel so honored to have skills and tools to
share that I know can boost their efforts, help them regenerate their spirit
and enthusiasm after hard times, and empower communities. </p>
<p>If you could do something to help heal the world, would you
plant rain gardens on the Paiute reserve in Nevada, or camp out in the path of
an oil pipeline, or inspire inner city youth to make environmental art, or
research the potential to sequester carbon with compost, or start rooftop
gardens in the South Bronx?  No one
of us can do it all, but all of us can be part of weaving this network of
support for all the visionaries who are turning problems into solutions.</p>
<p>Earth Activist Training offers
two-week residential permaculture design certificate courses, which are the
gateway into the global permaculture movement and a strong foundation for a
career in sustainability.  We hope
to raise $10,000 or more with this campaign, to cover our costs for ten or more Diversity Scholarship recipients. 
Any additional money we raise will seed scholarships and work trade
opportunities for upcoming short courses in natural building, a Spring Equinox
retreat, and a second permaculture design course in May.  </p>
<p>In 2013, we were able to offer
Diversity Scholarships to nineteen students over three courses, and to mentor
two African American women as assistant teachers.  In 2014, we hope to do even more!</p>
<p>One-third to one-half of our
students are on work trade or scholarships.  We offer work trade and fee
reductions to activists of all backgrounds.  In addition, we actively support three inner-city gardens in
San Francisco’s most stressed neighborhood of Bayview Hunters Point, providing
mentoring and training for the Girls2000 gardens and the Emerald City Green
Jobs Programs run by Hunters Point Family, which serves at-risk youth.  And we’ve helped support the Marda
Permaculture Farm in Palestine, where Starhawk taught a permaculture design
course in October.  We have a
strong track record of building trust in a wide spectrum of communities.</p>
<p>A small investment in Earth
Activist Training has a huge ripple effect. Any amount you can donate will help
diversify the environmental justice movement, bring new perspectives and
insights into the permaculture movement, and give activists and community
leaders the tools they need to build that beautiful world of the future we know
is possible!</p>
<p>Other ways to help:</p>
<p>Even small amounts of money add
up, so please feel free to donate whatever you can!  But there are many other ways to help:</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>TAP Bottles, Together Against Plastic Bottles, is a youth initiative in North Vancouver, with the mission to eliminate plastic bottles from our school and local community. We have now been working on this project for almost three years and have become very knowledgable and passionate about the issue. We are determined to make a difference.</p>
<p>The first step in our action plan is Awareness. In order to educate others about this issue we have presented to many different schools, and organizations including; Highlands, Ross Road and Brooksbank Elementary, Carson Graham Secondary, NVSD44 PAC, Surfrider Vancouver Chapter, Justice High, Change Pilotz and Ep!c: Vancouver's Sustainable Living Expo. We have been awarded a Civic Youth Award for ""Outstanding Youth Team."" And have received two $1000 grants; one from Change Pilotz, a program run by Capilano University. The second from the BC Green Games sponsored by Telus World of Science.</p>
<p>Our second step is to Provide an Alternative. We are doing this by selling our ""This makes one less"" reusable stainless steel water bottles.  We have already made three partnership orders of bottles with Sacre-Davey Engineering, King Marketing and Onedance Creative Arts Centre.</p>
<p>Our current goal is to fundraise enough money to install an outdoor water fountain and water bottle refill station in our community at Confederation Field. Thus providing a convenient alternative to single-use plastic bottles in our community.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul><li>The full installation cost of this refill station is $12000. We have currently raised $3500 from our two grants, selling our bottles, our fundraising and awareness BBQ company partnerships. Our goal is to raise half the money and seek matching funds from local organizations in the city. Raising $2500 would bring us to our goal of $6000. </li></ul>
<ul><li>For your generous donations we will be offering...</li></ul>
<p><b>$25 A BIG Thank you!</b> Which will get you a personal thank you letter, and recognition on our website and Facebook page!</p>
<p><b>$100 TAP Bottles Swag!</b> Which includes a personal thank you letter, and recognition on our website and Facebook page. PLUS a TAP Bottles ""This makes one less"" Water Bottle and magnet shipped directly to you!**</p>
<p><b>$1000 Partnership and Skype Session! </b>For this AMAZING donation you will receive Personal thank you letter, recognition on our website and Facebook page, a TAP Bottles ""This makes one less""  Water Bottle and magnet shipped directly to you!**  A Skype session to talk to us about our mission, PLUS a discounted price on a partnership order of TAP Bottles <span>reusable stainless steel water bottles </span>water bottles with your companies logo!</p>
<p>** Shipping of water bottles can only be done to those living in Canada. We apologize for any inconvenience</p>
<ul><li>If we are unable to make this goal all funds will still go towards the refill station and we will continue to raise money through other fundraisers such as another BBQ, a bottle drive and more partnerships and bottle sales. Our goal is to have the $6000 by the new year!</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact on Our Community</h3>
<p><span>Installing this refill station will <span>greatly enhance our community</span></span>.

Plastic bottles are typically made from domestic natural gas or oil, which are non-renewable fuel resource found within the earth. Only 27% of plastic bottles are recycled, with the remaining percentage ending up in landfills. Canadians drank an average of 66L of bottled water EACH in 2006, more than double the amount just 8 years earlier.

TAP Bottles, Together Against Plastic Bottles, is a youth initiative in North Vancouver, with the mission to eliminate plastic bottles from our school and local community. We have now been working on this project for almost three years and have become very knowledgable and passionate about the issue. We are determined to make a difference.
The first step in our action plan is Awareness. In order to educate others about this issue we have presented to many different schools, and organizations including; Highlands, Ross Road and Brooksbank Elementary, Carson Graham Secondary, NVSD44 PAC, Surfrider Vancouver Chapter, Justice High, Change Pilotz and Ep!c: Vancouver's Sustainable Living Expo. We have been awarded a Civic Youth Award for ""Outstanding Youth Team."" And have received two $1000 grants; one from Change Pilotz, a program run by Capilano University. The second from the BC Green Games sponsored by Telus World of Science.
Our second step is to Provide an Alternative. We are doing this by selling our ""This makes one less"" reusable stainless steel water bottles.  We have already made three partnership orders of bottles with Sacre-Davey Engineering, King Marketing and Onedance Creative Arts Centre.
Our current goal is to fundraise enough money to install an outdoor water fountain and water bottle refill station in our community at Confederation Field. Thus providing a convenient alternative to single-use plastic bottles in our community.


What We Need & What You Get
The full installation cost of this refill station is $12000. We have currently raised $3500 from our two grants, selling our bottles, our fundraising and awareness BBQ company partnerships. Our goal is to raise half the money and seek matching funds from local organizations in the city. Raising $2500 would bring us to our goal of $6000. 
For your generous donations we will be offering...
$25 A BIG Thank you! Which will get you a personal thank you letter, and recognition on our website and Facebook page!
$100 TAP Bottles Swag! Which includes a personal thank you letter, and recognition on our website and Facebook page. PLUS a TAP Bottles ""This makes one less"" Water Bottle and magnet shipped directly to you!**
$1000 Partnership and Skype Session! For this AMAZING donation you will receive Personal thank you letter, recognition on our website and Facebook page, a TAP Bottles ""This makes one less""  Water Bottle and magnet shipped directly to you!**  A Skype session to talk to us about our mission, PLUS a discounted price on a partnership order of TAP Bottles reusable stainless steel water bottles water bottles with your companies logo!
** Shipping of water bottles can only be done to those living in Canada. We apologize for any inconvenience
If we are unable to make this goal all funds will still go towards the refill station and we will continue to raise money through other fundraisers such as another BBQ, a bottle drive and more partnerships and bottle sales. Our goal is to have the $6000 by the new year!


The Impact on Our Community
Installing this refill station will greatly enhance our community. Confederation field is used on a daily basis: for the students of Carson Graham Secondary School; local sports clubs, including North Vancouver Football Club, West Vancouver Field Hockey Club, as well as the general public. Having a refill station at the field would reduce and eliminate the need for single-use plastic bottles which are used by players or spectators.

<h2><strong>ABOUT US</strong></h2>
<p>Charles &amp; Lisa met over 10 years ago whilst both working in the world of TV media. At that time they both shared a passion for a more sustainable and self sufficient lifestyle .... and so their dream began!</p>
<p>In 2010 Charles and Lisa planned and set up a beautiful woodland sanctuary called <a href=""http://www.forestgarden.info/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Forest Garden Shovelstrode  Website"">Forest Garden Shovelstrode</a> in Sussex - where people could come and learn different ways of living off the land through the preservation of our craft heritage.</p>
<h2>THE STORY SO FAR...</h2>
<p>Forest Garden Shovelstrode boasts two beautiful yurts located in a small piece of ancient woodland for people looking for a peaceful retreat. We run many courses including green woodworking, hurdle making, basket willow weaving, clay oven building, vegetable gardening, beekeeping, orchard harvest, sourdough bread making and mushroom foraging. We also a range of holistic and meditative workshops.</p>
<p>The courses are run from a temporary workshop made up from old army tents– and it is now time to build something more permanent!</p>
<p><em>""Just completed the Intro to Veg Gardening course, fantastic!! Lisa, Mandy and Justin provide an immensely enjoyable and informative day in a beautiful setting. Would thoroughly recommend it to all avid beginners like me. Thanks again.""</em></p>
<p><strong>Robert Lock (Course participant)</strong></p>
<p><em>""Had a tremendous time at the course on How to Make Products from Beeswax. I would highly recommend it. Many thanks to Justin, Lisa and Mandy. Great to meet you.""</em></p>
<p><strong>Mike Palmer (Course participant)</strong></p>
<h2><strong>THE PROJECT: TO BUILD A PERMANENT WOODLAND WORKSHOP</strong></h2>
<p>Planning permission has been granted for a 120sqm timber framed barn which will be our new permanent woodland workshop. It will be located beside the wildlife pond - in between the new Forest Garden and the ancient woodland. This will allow us to offer a greater range of courses to more people over an extended season.</p>
<p>A free place will be made available on each course to be people with special needs i.e. physical, intellectual or financial.</p>
<p>(See Gallery for plans and a impression of what the proposed woodland workshop will look like) </p>
<h2><strong>HOW YOU CAN HELP</strong></h2>
<p>By pledging any amount towards our project - every little will help us get a step closer to creating this important facility for the community.</p>
<h2><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>£   8,500          Ground works &amp; foundations</li>
<li>£ 36,000          Oak framed building: materials &amp; construction</li>
<li>£   8,500          Shingle roof: materials &amp; installation</li>
<li>£   8,750          External decked woodworking area</li>
<li>£   2,500          Internal floor surface</li>
<li>£   2,250          2 x Logburners &amp; flues</li>
<li><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">£   3,000          Rainwater harvesting </span></li>
</ul>
<p>Total needed to complete project = £   69,500</p>
<p>Initial target: <strong>£45,500 </strong>for ground works and timber frame including £1000 for a temporary canvas cover.</p>
<p>We wish to build a substantial oak framed building that will last for many years as shown in the attached plans (see gallery).

</div></div>","ABOUT US
Charles & Lisa met over 10 years ago whilst both working in the world of TV media. At that time they both shared a passion for a more sustainable and self sufficient lifestyle .... and so their dream began!
In 2010 Charles and Lisa planned and set up a beautiful woodland sanctuary called Forest Garden Shovelstrode in Sussex - where people could come and learn different ways of living off the land through the preservation of our craft heritage.
THE STORY SO FAR...
Forest Garden Shovelstrode boasts two beautiful yurts located in a small piece of ancient woodland for people looking for a peaceful retreat. We run many courses including green woodworking, hurdle making, basket willow weaving, clay oven building, vegetable gardening, beekeeping, orchard harvest, sourdough bread making and mushroom foraging. We also a range of holistic and meditative workshops.
The courses are run from a temporary workshop made up from old army tents– and it is now time to build something more permanent!
""Just completed the Intro to Veg Gardening course, fantastic!! Lisa, Mandy and Justin provide an immensely enjoyable and informative day in a beautiful setting. Would thoroughly recommend it to all avid beginners like me. Thanks again.""
Robert Lock (Course participant)
""Had a tremendous time at the course on How to Make Products from Beeswax. I would highly recommend it. Many thanks to Justin, Lisa and Mandy. Great to meet you.""
Mike Palmer (Course participant)
THE PROJECT: TO BUILD A PERMANENT WOODLAND WORKSHOP
Planning permission has been granted for a 120sqm timber framed barn which will be our new permanent woodland workshop. It will be located beside the wildlife pond - in between the new Forest Garden and the ancient woodland. This will allow us to offer a greater range of courses to more people over an extended season.
A free place will be made available on each course to be people with special needs i.e. physical, intellectual or financial.
(See Gallery for plans and a impression of what the proposed woodland workshop will look like) 
HOW YOU CAN HELP
By pledging any amount towards our project - every little will help us get a step closer to creating this important facility for the community.
WHAT WE NEED

£   8,500          Ground works & foundations
£ 36,000          Oak framed building: materials & construction
£   8,500          Shingle roof: materials & installation
£   8,750          External decked woodworking area
£   2,500          Internal floor surface
£   2,250          2 x Logburners & flues
£   3,000          Rainwater harvesting 

Total needed to complete project = £   69,500
Initial target: £45,500 for ground works and timber frame including £1000 for a temporary canvas cover.
We wish to build a substantial oak framed building that will last for many years as shown in the attached plans (see gallery). However if the inital target is not reached we will look at compromises we could make, such as materials and size of building, so that the project will still proceed.

<p>The <em><strong>Food Systems Journal</strong> </em>promotes strategies to address both hunger and farm loss, shares practical research &amp; best practices, and provides an opportunity to publish in the emerging field of food systems development.</p>
<p>Our editorial board includes an advisory committee of 25 leading scholars and practitioners, and over 150 peer reviewers from around the world. They all donate their time and expertise at no cost.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>Food Systems Journal</em></strong> is the world's only online, peer-reviewed research publication focused on local and regional food system development. We publish case studies, commentaries, and survey results on the state of the art in agriculture and food systems-based community development. Having our papers reviewed by teams of experts who approve their publication means that we are publishing original and useful research.</p>
<p>Some examples of topics we’ve published over the past 3 years include:</p>
<p>* What it’s like to be on a local food diet.;</p>
<p>* What cities are doing to promote livestock production;</p>
<p>* How insurance companies are giving rebates to local CSA members;</p>

<p align=""center""><strong>HYDROGEN FUEL SYSTEM - COMMERCIAL VEHICLE APPLICATION</strong></p>
<p>E-CHOICE is a six (6) component system that will replace the fossil fuel systems (gas or diesel) on commercial vehicles (trucks and buses).  95% of this system is based on currently used and accepted technology (software and hardware).  The remaining 5% consists of newly available technology and products that will become marketable with the success of our project.  Examples of the individual component technologies are readily available through simple online searches.</p>
<p>Beginning with the Electrolysis Tank (E-Tank), we have decided to produce the six (6) components in the prototype system one at a time; to help manage the security of our working theories, and to take advantage of a multi-patent process. Since the E-Tank is the lynchpin of the system, we will develop it first.  In the following will provide a basic description of the E-Tank, followed by a brief description of the remaining components, in the order we will produce them.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>BRIEF HISTORY</strong></p>
<p>This has been a lifetime endeavor that became this conversion project 12 years ago as the most logical advance for a proposed local transit system plan; developed for my home town (Ridgecrest, CA) in the early 1970s.  Although the initial concept was mine, I had a lot of help along the way.  Patrick Obracken (deceased) helped me develop the plan for a local transit system…a system that would be the only non-government subsidized public transit system in the country (and could still be).  I invited Duane A. Burkey to join the transit project in the mid-1970s.  His mechanical knowledge and an ability to see the potential in combining hardware and technology, in non-conventional configurations, helped lead our research in the right direction.  In the late 1970s, Charles E. Quinlan joined the project as our business and technology consultant.  In addition to more than 20 years of successful small business operation, he has successfully passed the California BAR examination, and has ready access to PhD level electrical and chemical engineering review for our system.  We three: Duane, Charles, and I are the executive team and sole proponents of the JEMSTAR Group E-CHOICE project, and we are asking for your help to begin building our prototype system.</p>
<p>While there is not an existing prototype, there are multiple examples of all the involved technologies available on the internet…all facets of this project are based on existing and proven technologies, which we will combine into an, as yet, untried configuration.</p>
<p align=""center"">PREMISE</p>
<p>This system is a 95% combination of disparate existing and proven technologies reconfigured into a new, workable, combinative system.  The remaining 5% is new technology (developed but not implemented) which eliminates the dual problems of distribution and storage.  This is not a <em>“Fuel Cell”</em> system; it is a component replacement system that encompasses fuel production and delivery methods for use of hydrogen as the primary fuel source in commercial sized vehicles; with the intent to reduce and eventually eliminate the use of fossil fuels for motive power.  The design parameters are theoretical at present, and funding to develop a working prototype system will allow us to prove (or disprove) the viability of the proposed fuel system.</p>
<p>The E-CHOICE fuel system will use currently unused kinetic energy (created by movement of the vehicle) to produce a majority of the fuel needed to operate the vehicle (static fill-up will be used for initial operation).</p>
<p>The six (6) components that comprise the full system (as configured for commercial sized vehicles) will completely replace most fossil fuel systems in commercial applications.  Listed in the order we hope to develop them in, they are:</p>
<p>1)      Electrolysis Tank (E-Tank):  A baffled, dual chamber design that incorporates 3 separate technologies and a fully biodegradable electrolyzing agent for electrolysis of water.  Using water, every liter of water converts to 1,666 liters of useable gases (2/3 hydrogen, 1/3 oxygen).  This is the lynchpin of the entire system and must produce 1cu.yd. of hydrogen per minute to be viable as a fuel source.  The production will be cyclic; dependent on the levels/pressures needed in the next two components.</p>
<p>2)      Hydrogen Storage Tank (HST):  25-100 gallon tank (size depends on application; smaller size for buses/local uses) weighing approximately one pound per gallon of capacity.  Using the technology in the 5% category, a 25lb. tank will hold the equivalent of 165 gallons of gasoline…at less than 150psi.</p>
<p>3)      Oxygen Boost Tank (OBT):  25% of the oxygen produced in the E-Tank will be stored @ 250psi for re-combinative power under high load conditions (uphill, merging acceleration, etc.).  The remaining 75% of the oxygen will be released to atmosphere (replacing free oxygen lost to deforestation will be very good for the environment).</p>
<p>4)      Fuel Delivery System (FDS):  The actual “plumbing” of the system.  This includes all routing of produced gases from the E-Tank(s), through storage, and eventually to the intake on the engine.  Stainless steel, compression fittings, and aircraft grade hoses will be used throughout.</p>
<p>5)      Generator Axle (G-Axle): This will be the source of the DC power needed for the E-Tank(s).  Using the kinetic energy produced by movement of the vehicle will provide a power source that is not dependent on engine RPM, and will give the system constant power regardless of acceleration/deceleration…full power at 5mph or faster.</p>
<p>6)      Computerized Electronic Control Module (CECM): This will be the “brain” of the system and will control all aspects from the G-Axle, through electrolysis cycling, fuel storage, and release to metered intake delivery mixtures/pressures (H/O)</p>

(Electrolysis - Creating Hydrogen Onboard Internal Combustion Engine)
HYDROGEN FUEL SYSTEM - COMMERCIAL VEHICLE APPLICATION
E-CHOICE is a six (6) component system that will replace the fossil fuel systems (gas or diesel) on commercial vehicles (trucks and buses).  95% of this system is based on currently used and accepted technology (software and hardware).  The remaining 5% consists of newly available technology and products that will become marketable with the success of our project.  Examples of the individual component technologies are readily available through simple online searches.
Beginning with the Electrolysis Tank (E-Tank), we have decided to produce the six (6) components in the prototype system one at a time; to help manage the security of our working theories, and to take advantage of a multi-patent process. Since the E-Tank is the lynchpin of the system, we will develop it first.  In the following will provide a basic description of the E-Tank, followed by a brief description of the remaining components, in the order we will produce them.
BRIEF HISTORY
This has been a lifetime endeavor that became this conversion project 12 years ago as the most logical advance for a proposed local transit system plan; developed for my home town (Ridgecrest, CA) in the early 1970s.  Although the initial concept was mine, I had a lot of help along the way.  Patrick Obracken (deceased) helped me develop the plan for a local transit system…a system that would be the only non-government subsidized public transit system in the country (and could still be).  I invited Duane A. Burkey to join the transit project in the mid-1970s.  His mechanical knowledge and an ability to see the potential in combining hardware and technology, in non-conventional configurations, helped lead our research in the right direction.  In the late 1970s, Charles E. Quinlan joined the project as our business and technology consultant.  In addition to more than 20 years of successful small business operation, he has successfully passed the California BAR examination, and has ready access to PhD level electrical and chemical engineering review for our system.  We three: Duane, Charles, and I are the executive team and sole proponents of the JEMSTAR Group E-CHOICE project, and we are asking for your help to begin building our prototype system.
While there is not an existing prototype, there are multiple examples of all the involved technologies available on the internet…all facets of this project are based on existing and proven technologies, which we will combine into an, as yet, untried configuration.
PREMISE
This system is a 95% combination of disparate existing and proven technologies reconfigured into a new, workable, combinative system.  The remaining 5% is new technology (developed but not implemented) which eliminates the dual problems of distribution and storage.  This is not a “Fuel Cell” system; it is a component replacement system that encompasses fuel production and delivery methods for use of hydrogen as the primary fuel source in commercial sized vehicles; with the intent to reduce and eventually eliminate the use of fossil fuels for motive power.  The design parameters are theoretical at present, and funding to develop a working prototype system will allow us to prove (or disprove) the viability of the proposed fuel system.
The E-CHOICE fuel system will use currently unused kinetic energy (created by movement of the vehicle) to produce a majority of the fuel needed to operate the vehicle (static fill-up will be used for initial operation).
The six (6) components that comprise the full system (as configured for commercial sized vehicles) will completely replace most fossil fuel systems in commercial applications.  Listed in the order we hope to develop them in, they are:
1)      Electrolysis Tank (E-Tank):  A baffled, dual chamber design that incorporates 3 separate technologies and a fully biodegradable electrolyzing agent for electrolysis of water.  Using water, every liter of water converts to 1,666 liters of useable gases (2/3 hydrogen, 1/3 oxygen).  This is the lynchpin of the entire system and must produce 1cu.yd. of hydrogen per minute to be viable as a fuel source.  The production will be cyclic; dependent on the levels/pressures needed in the next two components.
2)      Hydrogen Storage Tank (HST):  25-100 gallon tank (size depends on application; smaller size for buses/local uses) weighing approximately one pound per gallon of capacity.  Using the technology in the 5% category, a 25lb. tank will hold the equivalent of 165 gallons of gasoline…at less than 150psi.
3)      Oxygen Boost Tank (OBT):  25% of the oxygen produced in the E-Tank will be stored @ 250psi for re-combinative power under high load conditions (uphill, merging acceleration, etc.).  The remaining 75% of the oxygen will be released to atmosphere (replacing free oxygen lost to deforestation will be very good for the environment).
4)      Fuel Delivery System (FDS):  The actual “plumbing” of the system.  This includes all routing of produced gases from the E-Tank(s), through storage, and eventually to the intake on the engine.  Stainless steel, compression fittings, and aircraft grade hoses will be used throughout.
5)      Generator Axle (G-Axle): This will be the source of the DC power needed for the E-Tank(s).  Using the kinetic energy produced by movement of the vehicle will provide a power source that is not dependent on engine RPM, and will give the system constant power regardless of acceleration/deceleration…full power at 5mph or faster.
6)      Computerized Electronic Control Module (CECM): This will be the “brain” of the system and will control all aspects from the G-Axle, through electrolysis cycling, fuel storage, and release to metered intake delivery mixtures/pressures (H/O)
A little known yet interesting fact: Until the Pennsylvania oil strike in the early 1900s, most internal combustion engines (ICE) used hydrogen as the best fuel available.  After Pennsylvania, oil was so much cheaper and easier to use that hydrogen was abandoned…though the technology remained.  With today’s technology, fossil fuel (oil) is no longer the best alternative; neither financially nor environmentally.  If the E-CHOICE fuel system is successful, the benefits are substantial:
Hydrogen will be 75% (or higher) less expensive to produce. ($.25 - $.75 per gallon)
Ultra low to zero pollution: dependent on engine lubricant used (fossil fuel or organic).
The system will remove the need for a separate fueling infrastructure.
70 jobs created for the initial prototype…potentially millions within 10 years.
Environmental repair achieved by increased atmospheric oxygen – decreased pollution.
Energy security: ending our dependence on foreign oil.
There is unlimited crossover potential for other industries.
Hydrogen is an unlimited resource…it is not “consumed” during the combustion process, every molecule is returned as pure water vapor.  The JEMSTAR group believes it is time to leave the fossil fuels of the Industrial Age behind and begin making everyone’s life easier (and healthier) by moving into the Hydrogen Age.
We realize the amount we are asking for seems high, but the reality is we need to acquire the working space, equipment, and personnel for the initial prototype (including paying wages). If the E-Tank prototype is successful, the full prototype system should be ready to begin road testing within 5 years.  In the event our efforts to produce a working E-Tank fail, we will survey our contributors to determine which project(s) on indiegogo.com should receive any of our remaining funds.

the Table: A Peoples Food Policy for Canada - Page 25</a></i><br/></p><h3><b>Back Story</b></h3><p>Three years ago at
      TapRoot Farms we started raising animals for the purpose of
      providing
      fertility to the soil for our vegetable crops and tilling of the
      soil
      by the pigs (working to establish more permaculture
      infrastructure).
      Up until now we have not been growing our own grains for the
      animals
      to eat. We have been sourcing certified organic grains for our
      hens
      (eggs) and non organic, GMO feed for the other animals. This is
      not
      how we have wanted it to be but because of the cost of certified
      organic grain we haven't switched all the animals to this feed and
      haven't found a source for non organic non GMO feed as of yet. And
      so, this year we decided to do something about it.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/893825/files/20140930130146-tim_and_pigs.jpg?1412107306"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3><b>This Year</b></h3>This year we set up an
      agreement with a young farmer (in his 30's with a young family) to
      contract
      grow non GMO corn and soy for us. He is also growing barley and
      wheat
      for the farm. These crops will provide us with all of the
      ingredients
      to mix feed for our pigs, chickens, ducks, turkeys, sheep, and
      cattle. <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/893833/files/20140930130336-IMG_2288.JPG?1412107416"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The challenge for us
      at
      TapRoot is that we need to cash flow the grain that the animals
      are
      eating now, at the same time as paying for the contract growing
      and
      set-up of the feed for this coming year. We agreed to pay the
      farmer $600 per tonne for what we expect to be 100 tonne of feed. The farmer
      was very concerned about a possible yield loss (we think this
      belief
      was based on propaganda) so we agreed to pay $30 000.00 in-advance
      to
      help with the costs of growing the crop and expect to pay the
      additional $30,000.00 when the crop is in storage. In addition to
      growing the crop, we also needed to put in storage tanks so that
      the non-GMO grains could be stored in isolation of GMO grains.
      This cost
      was $3000.00. We also expect to pay $100 per tonne for the milling
      fee when we take the feed to be turned into mash the animals can
      eat.</p>
<p>Basically, in this
      fiscal year (2014) we are cash flowing the shift from GMO feed to Non GMO
      feed of just over $73,000.00. Now we find ourselves needing to ask for
      support in making this shift. </p>
<p>Here is what normally
      happens (for farms without their own storage and milling
      equipment): A farmer grows a crop
      of grain. They hire or own a combine to harvest the grain. The
      grain
      is then hauled to a common storage (big huge bins that hold
      multiple
      farmers grains). In this situation, you never get your own grain
      back, because it is in one big bin together. You know you have
      harvested for example 10 tonnes and then throughout the year as you
      need to make feed you go and take out from the storage what you
      need.
      You let the grain centre know what you need and then they will
      mill
      the feed for you into the ration you ask for. This system works well if the production systems and quality are all equal. When you want start doing something different,  for example, growing non-gmo grain, then it gets more complicated and expensive.</p><p>We are doing this because we trust and honour nature, diversity and our ecosystem. We are now growing the grains that feed our animals close to home in a way that provides opportunities to local farmers, and honours the integrity of organic agriculture systems.   </p><h3><b>Why</b></h3><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F9wvKg2UfD8U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D9wvKg2UfD8U&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F9wvKg2UfD8U%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>Why help us? Because cash is required for taking care of this planet through our agricultural practices and the amount needed in this region of the world is rather tremendous. It is a values based decision, not a monetary return on investment business model. Most farmers we know who are transitioning to a system of agriculture that is based on a deeply held value of taking care of the earth are not getting a return on investment they require, basically they struggle. We need to make this shift as a collective. You may wonder, why not just increase the cost of the meat. If we were to down load the full cost of this transition to the people who purchase our meat via our meat shares, then again, we would be unloading an unfair amount of cost to a few people for a shift that we hope will benefit many. It feels rather complicated and hard to explain, but if you will, consider this a donation in support of a system change - a system change in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia for this farm to grow, store, and feed non GMO feed to our animals and to possibly set in motion a way forward for our friends and neighbours. You are welcome to visit the farm any time, to ask questions and see for yourself what we are all about. <h4><br/></h4><h3>Some Context<br/>

      providing
      fertility to the soil for our vegetable crops and tilling of the
      soil
      by the pigs (working to establish more permaculture
      infrastructure).
      Up until now we have not been growing our own grains for the
      animals
      to eat. We have been sourcing certified organic grains for our
      hens
      (eggs) and non organic, GMO feed for the other animals. This is
      not
      how we have wanted it to be but because of the cost of certified
      organic grain we haven't switched all the animals to this feed and
      haven't found a source for non organic non GMO feed as of yet. And
      so, this year we decided to do something about it.This YearThis year we set up an
      agreement with a young farmer (in his 30's with a young family) to
      contract
      grow non GMO corn and soy for us. He is also growing barley and
      wheat
      for the farm. These crops will provide us with all of the
      ingredients
      to mix feed for our pigs, chickens, ducks, turkeys, sheep, and
      cattle. 
The challenge for us
      at
      TapRoot is that we need to cash flow the grain that the animals
      are
      eating now, at the same time as paying for the contract growing
      and
      set-up of the feed for this coming year. We agreed to pay the
      farmer $600 per tonne for what we expect to be 100 tonne of feed. The farmer
      was very concerned about a possible yield loss (we think this
      belief
      was based on propaganda) so we agreed to pay $30 000.00 in-advance
      to
      help with the costs of growing the crop and expect to pay the
      additional $30,000.00 when the crop is in storage. In addition to
      growing the crop, we also needed to put in storage tanks so that
      the non-GMO grains could be stored in isolation of GMO grains.
      This cost
      was $3000.00. We also expect to pay $100 per tonne for the milling
      fee when we take the feed to be turned into mash the animals can
      eat.
Basically, in this
      fiscal year (2014) we are cash flowing the shift from GMO feed to Non GMO
      feed of just over $73,000.00. Now we find ourselves needing to ask for
      support in making this shift. 
Here is what normally
      happens (for farms without their own storage and milling
      equipment): A farmer grows a crop
      of grain. They hire or own a combine to harvest the grain. The
      grain
      is then hauled to a common storage (big huge bins that hold
      multiple
      farmers grains). In this situation, you never get your own grain
      back, because it is in one big bin together. You know you have
      harvested for example 10 tonnes and then throughout the year as you
      need to make feed you go and take out from the storage what you
      need.
      You let the grain centre know what you need and then they will
      mill
      the feed for you into the ration you ask for. This system works well if the production systems and quality are all equal. When you want start doing something different,  for example, growing non-gmo grain, then it gets more complicated and expensive.We are doing this because we trust and honour nature, diversity and our ecosystem. We are now growing the grains that feed our animals close to home in a way that provides opportunities to local farmers, and honours the integrity of organic agriculture systems.   WhyWhy help us? Because cash is required for taking care of this planet through our agricultural practices and the amount needed in this region of the world is rather tremendous. It is a values based decision, not a monetary return on investment business model. Most farmers we know who are transitioning to a system of agriculture that is based on a deeply held value of taking care of the earth are not getting a return on investment they require, basically they struggle. We need to make this shift as a collective. You may wonder, why not just increase the cost of the meat. If we were to down load the full cost of this transition to the people who purchase our meat via our meat shares, then again, we would be unloading an unfair amount of cost to a few people for a shift that we hope will benefit many. It feels rather complicated and hard to explain, but if you will, consider this a donation in support of a system change - a system change in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia for this farm to grow, store, and feed non GMO feed to our animals and to possibly set in motion a way forward for our friends and neighbours. You are welcome to visit the farm any time, to ask questions and see for yourself what we are all about. Some Context
Resetting the Table A People's Food Policy for Canada  : ""Genetically-Modified  Organisms  (GMOs)  are  living pollution  that  self-replicate.  They  cannot  be  recalled  or controlled  once  they  have  been  released  and  can  spread and  interbreed  with  other  organisms,  thereby  contaminating  ecosystems  and  affecting  future  generations  in unforeseeable    and    uncontrollable    ways.    Genetically- Modified (GM) crops threaten agro-biodiversity which is fundamental to global food security, as well as threaten the future  of  organic  food  and  farming  through  contamination. Existing GM crops should be phased out and there should be no further approvals of GM crops and animals. A just transition process, including financial and technical support, needs to be established to assist farmers to shift back  to  non-GM  seed  sources  and  to  adopt  ecological agricultural practices.""

Josh grew up in Hants County Nova Scotia. Patricia grew up in Greenwich Nova Scotia. We met at the Nova Scotia Agricultural College. We started farming in 2004 with the purchase of 144 acres in Canard Nova Scotia. In 2007 we took out another loan to purchase a homestead, 22 acres, certified organic in Port Williams. This began our organic farming journey. Basically, we care a whole lot about growing good food for families, taking care of the soil and ecosystem and respecting and caring for the people who make it all happen. We now have 60 acres in certified organic production and 40 acres in transition to organic. Izaak (12), Lily (8) and Frank (7) are along with us on this journey. We also share this journey with Justine, Nathan, Gilbery, Falicia, Jon, Jocelyn, Louise, Gerald, Calvin, Pheobe, Melvin, Amy, Tim, Teri, Tim, Valarie, Michael, Garfield, Sylvan, Jem, Meagan, Malcolm, Patrick, Betty, Evelyn, Kingsley, Bolo, Wesley, Cournelius, Bobby, Cocotee, Ashley, Martel, Patrick, Aliah, Chris, Steve, Richard, Jillian, Karen and Cecil, Jenn, and all of our families.

My goal is to raise the environmental awareness of my fellow Haitians, while providing the means to modify the old practices of cutting trees to cook food and depending on food aid and handouts for survival. I am returning home this summer with my 4 children and several volunteers to share skills and information that will benefit my people and the environment.  We are planning to have youth workshops, led mostly by my children, ages 5-10, to teach young Haitians how to construct simple solar ovens like the one they have created and use here, out of newspaper, boxes, plexi-glass/glass remnants and aluminum.  These materials can be found there for free or we already have them.  The adult volunteers will focus more on composting, which requires no supplies, and introducing aquaponics. We employ individuals to collect non-food waste from the streets, convert that into “eco blocks” that can be used to build fish ponds and drums, buckets, or other reusable materials we find for plant beds in the aquaponics system.  Funds will primarily be used to put Haitians back to work cleaning up the country’s waste problem and rebuilding it with the same materials, one recycled block at a time.  We plan to use native fruit trees to feed the fish and use the extra fish waste to grow native root plants like yam, manioc etc…Pumps (hand or solar), shade cloth,and  ph testing kits will need to be purchased here in US, while gravel, pvc pipes and frames for the beds will have to be gotten there at a higher cost.  The system will be a simple flood and drain reducing on the need for expensive maintenance for the long term.  The plan is to continue small fundraising efforts to keep a small maintainance team for the aquaponics systems.  Volunteers will also supplement the program with reforestation, yoga, leaf medicine and general ecological education.  The Haitian Office of the Ombudsman is housing the volunteers and facilitating a Cite Soleil Outreach Plan for the Alternative Ayiti Project from July 1 – August 15, 2010.   Fotokonbit will be documenting the work done in August.  We are looking for donations of shade cloths, small solar pumps and panels, ph testing supplies (things small enough to travel with.) Monetary donations will also be accepted to pay for the materials in Haiti and to pay for labor, which will, in turn, give a much needed boost to the economy.  Any amount is helpful in the rebuilding effort.</p></div>","I am a Haitian artist living in the SF Bay area. I started Alternative Ayiti Project to help Ayiti (Haiti) help itself.

<h3>My Work as an Herbalist</h3>
<p class=""first"">As a locavore, urban farmer and herbalist I am seeking community investors in an upcoming clinical herbalism training with <a href=""http://www.ndimed.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Natural Doctors International</a> at their donation-based clinic in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ometepe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ometepe, Nicaragua</a>. This training will grow my skills as an herbalist and teacher so I can better connect more people to the land around them and empower them with the herbal skills that can add wellness to their lives.</p>
<p class=""first"">Working from <a href=""http://burdockandrose.tumblr.com/archive"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my urban gardens and wild spaces</a> in Grand Rapids, I connect people to the traditional lifeways of using herbs  -- in my classes people how to forage, cook with whole foods, garden and use local plants and herbs for herbal remedies.  </p>
<p>There have been few other times in our current history of the United States when people have been more aware of their health issues, have faced enormous economic challenges, and have had a significant lack of access to conventional health care.</p>
<p>People are turning to traditional lifeways -- tending a garden, cooking in the kitchen, eating meals with their families -- as part of taking care of themselves and keeping themselves well. I believe these skills and traditional lifeways are a basic right and want to make sure my work is accessible to everyone, not just to those who can afford to learn a niche skill. To that end, I always offer my classes with an option for sliding scale depending on ability to pay.</p>
<p>Turning to the community to help support me in this journey is a testament that I, too, am reliant on you to help value these skills and what I am offering to our local community. Thus, helping invest in my skills as a teacher will help ensure that I can most effectively work across cultural borders in our community as well as repond to their personal needs in a more helpful way.</p>

<h3>Clinical Training with Natural Doctors International</h3>
<p>It is difficult to find hands-on learning experiences with experienced herbal teachers in my community. I currently travel a great deal-- in addition to reading, working in the outdoors and spending time in my herbal kitchen and apothecary-- to connect with teaching expertise so I can continue to push my understanding and knowledge of the plants and their traditional uses. </p>
<p>In November I seek to study with a few of our country's top herbalists for a clinical training hosted by Natural Doctors International at their donation-based clinic in Ometepe, Nicaragua. </p>
<p>The clinical training with Natural Doctors International will run from Novmember 8-26 in Ometepe, Nicaragua. The training includes a variety of experiences -- shadowing under physicians, herbalists and natural doctors as well as learning the plants that are used in traditional healing in this area - not only in the clinic but by also being in the fields and on the farms where the plants are grown. </p>
<p>Natural Doctors International operates their clinic as a donation based clinic -- they rely on the service of physicians, herbalists, and natural doctors for staff support and donations of herbal formulas and other medicial supplies to help meet the needs of the community that lives on the island of Ometepe in Lake Nicaragua. </p>
<p>The cost of the three week training is $2700.00 plus airfare. I have already invested my own monies for the deposit to Natural Doctors International and have paid for my plane ticket, and am absorbing the costs for my travel visa, necessary shots, scrubs, and the fees hosting this campaign (about 8% of the total money raised). Please consider a small donation to help make this training a reality for me.</p>

<p><strong>                                                     Phase 1<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
<p>     We are dedicated to providing a sanctuary for wolves where they may live in peace, to help people understand their nature, and to save their dying population.. The goal is to build a fully sustainable, earthen cob village, including of course the <strong>wolf sanctuary</strong>, encourage <strong>community involvemen</strong>t through educational workshops and gatherings, and promote a <strong>simple, organic lifestyle</strong> that is harmonious with the natural flow of creation. At the same time, our mission is to encourage the preservation of some of the world's most ancient mountains, our earth, and the wildlife that seeks to coexist.  Mountaintops in several areas are being removed using explosives for easier access to fossil fuels, coal, etc.  Our self-sustaining community would insure the preservation of the surrounding area, with little to no disturbance of the natural flow of land. Our Blue Wolf Santcuary and Cob Village will contribute to all of these issues..making the world a better place for man, wolf, other creatures, and Mother Earth.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>So..Why Wolves?<br/></strong></p>
<p>    Wolves/wolfdogs may possibly be some of the most misunderstood creatures; they are intelligent and loyal. They mate for life, have families, and live in packs. It is a common misconception that wolves seek to harm humans. Wolves are actually <em>afraid</em> of humans; their only true predator is <strong>man</strong>.. Studies have shown that 60-90% of mortailties in wolves are through human causes via <strong>trapping, poisoning, and hunting</strong>.. These lovely creatures are extinct in many areas of the world; places where they use to run freely and live their life to no avail.. Their population is slowly dwindling down further as we speak.. The world has already lost 7 different species of wolves. <strong>Extinction is forever.</strong></p>
<p>     Hunting season for the wolves began on October 15 because the wolves are viewed as a threat to farmers and ranchers. In all acutality, <strong>wolves help balance the ecosystem</strong>.  Wolves are carnivorous, feeding on herbivores (animals that feed on plant life such as moose, elk, deer, rabbit, and mice).

<p><strong>The Cob Village<br/></strong></p>
<p>     Cob (which means lump) is an efficient use of <strong>natural materials</strong> (a mixture of clay, sand, straw, and water). Building with cob is simple, inexpensive, and resourceful. Cob is very insulating and durable, with many cob homes lasting over <strong>700 years</strong> through many natural disasters, and are even <strong>fire resistant</strong>! In fact, pizza ovens and fireplaces can be made out of cob simply by taking out the straw. Each cob structure in our village will be equipped with a <strong>living roof</strong>, (a thick blanket of turf, plants, flowers, and herbs), which is beneficial to the environment and those who live in, under, and around it. Turf roofs keep the home cool in the summer, warm in the winter, decrease the global warming effect, absorb 85% of rainfall, and improve air quality. The plant material absorbs carbon dioxide and excess pollution from the atmosphere, and releases oxygen into the air. This <strong>fully self-sustaining</strong> earthen project will be powered from <strong>natural energy: solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.</strong> Approximately 30% of the homes in the world are built of earth, and approximately 50% of people in developing countries live in earthen homes. </p>
<p>    Our <strong>non-profit organziation</strong> will include a fully sustainable bed and breakfast with 7 ""cobins.""  Guests will be able to visit the wolves in their sanctuary and experience their true nature firsthand. <strong>Workshops and seminars</strong> will be held weekly for people to enjoy during their stay, with a wide range of topics including buliding with cob, soap and candle making, natural healing and herbalism, music instruction, martial arts, and more.  Proceeds will benefit charities and other organizations with common goals, and eventually we hope to be able to travel to places in need and provide them with cob homes and shelters so they too may enjoy a fully self-sustainable lifestyle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>For the Artists</strong></p>
<p>    We are convinced that creativity is a healthy, even necessary aspect of life, so the village will also be home to an <strong>artist 'cobstel'</strong>, a cobin that will be available at low to no cost/barter to <strong>traveling artists of all kinds, shapes and sizes</strong> in need of a warm bed and a home-cooked meal.. It will sleep 8 people at a time so we are able to accomodate the needs of traveling groups or bands. </p>

Our Mission
     We are dedicated to providing a sanctuary for wolves where they may live in peace, to help people understand their nature, and to save their dying population.. The goal is to build a fully sustainable, earthen cob village, including of course the wolf sanctuary, encourage community involvement through educational workshops and gatherings, and promote a simple, organic lifestyle that is harmonious with the natural flow of creation. At the same time, our mission is to encourage the preservation of some of the world's most ancient mountains, our earth, and the wildlife that seeks to coexist.  Mountaintops in several areas are being removed using explosives for easier access to fossil fuels, coal, etc.  Our self-sustaining community would insure the preservation of the surrounding area, with little to no disturbance of the natural flow of land. Our Blue Wolf Santcuary and Cob Village will contribute to all of these issues..making the world a better place for man, wolf, other creatures, and Mother Earth.
 
So..Why Wolves?
    Wolves/wolfdogs may possibly be some of the most misunderstood creatures; they are intelligent and loyal. They mate for life, have families, and live in packs. It is a common misconception that wolves seek to harm humans. Wolves are actually afraid of humans; their only true predator is man.. Studies have shown that 60-90% of mortailties in wolves are through human causes via trapping, poisoning, and hunting.. These lovely creatures are extinct in many areas of the world; places where they use to run freely and live their life to no avail.. Their population is slowly dwindling down further as we speak.. The world has already lost 7 different species of wolves. Extinction is forever.
     Hunting season for the wolves began on October 15 because the wolves are viewed as a threat to farmers and ranchers. In all acutality, wolves help balance the ecosystem.  Wolves are carnivorous, feeding on herbivores (animals that feed on plant life such as moose, elk, deer, rabbit, and mice). Many of these animals tend to eat large amounts of roots, sapplings, shoots, crops, and other plant material. Therefore, crops tend to thrive more lively when the wolves are around.  This is the balance of life, and wolves are a crucial part of this tenuous balance.
      The average life expectancy of a wolf in the wild is 6-8 years, but in captivity they enjoy a lifespan of up to 16-18 years.  Blue Wolf plans to provide full housing, rehabilitation and an adoption center for wolves in need.  The sanctuary will rest in the Appalacian Mountains, in a habitat where the wolves will thrive happily, have plenty of room to run, and freely express themselves.  Some wolves will be available for adoption, others will stay for life depending on their individual needs.

<p><b>My
name is Paul and I have been in various sectors of the waste industry for 20+

<p>Imagine this…it’s a beautiful Saturday and you wake
up and decide you want to clean out your garage. You call to rent a dumpster (for
$99) but are told it won’t be delivered to Monday. Bummer – not getting the
clean out done this weekend! Monday comes, you fill it up. One week later it
gets picked up and you find out that you have $150 delivery/pickup charge, and
$75 fuel surcharge, AND you now owe the dumpster company $200 for additional
weight that you put in the dumpster because the rental price only included 1
ton of material! WHAT?! You had to wait for the dumpster to be delivered AND
you owe an <i><u>additional</u></i> $425 for
what you thought was only costing you $99! That’s $524!!! And to add insult to
injury, everything ended up in the landfill – nothing was recycled! We recycle 65% or more of what we pick up!<br/></p><p>The BullBag solves each of these problems! A
patented, multiuse dumpster bag that once purchased, is guaranteed for life.
That Saturday morning, you could have just went to your shelf, got your water
permeable, self standing BullBag, opened, set it up and filled it. Monday it
could have been picked up, emptied it and your bag given right back to you - and
it would have been done for (the same weight as what you put in the dumpster
that cost you an additional $200 in overweight fees), ONLY $229! (an overall
savings of<span>  $295) Plus, 65% of all
contents are recycled so it helps keep the earth green and less ending up in
the landfills! So, to summarize: customers are never without a dumpster, it is
emptied within 48 hours of request, and it is cost effective and green!Even the BullBag can be recycled!</span></p><p><span>You Fill It! We Dump It! You Keep It!</span></p>
<p><b>The

<p>Look out Shell! You've got a new neighbor: The People's Platform. Last Friday we anchored the People's Platform in Elliott Bay just a few hundred yards from Terminal 5, Shell's new base of operations. We were at the center of the Paddle in Seattle kayak armada and were honored to host dozens of Coast Salish nations from the Pacific Northwest for a Native American jam session and speak out against Shell on our stage. </p><p>In a direct rebuke to Shell's massive drill rig, Polar Pioneer, folks have begun referring to the People's Platform as the Solar Pioneer. Until Shell leaves port we'll be lighting up the nights, projecting videos and elevating the voices of folks from all over the world who take issue with Shell's destructive practices. </p><p>Please chip into our Indiegogo and help us keep the People's Platform shining brightly on the water, bearing witness to Shell's crimes against the climate. </p><p>Thanks!!</p>
<hr/>
<div> <h3>The Lowdown</h3>
<p>Shell is bringing its oil rigs into Seattle before heading up to the Arctic Ocean to begin exploratory drilling this summer.</p>
<p>So, we want to show Shell what safe energy production REALLY looks like. That's why we're constructing the ""People's Platform"", a floating showcase of energy solutions that are a whole lot less STUPID than Shell's proposed drilling plan.</p>
<p>We're turning an ordinary marine barge into the People's Platform with solar panels and wind turbines to energize our incredible show of people power. We'll light up the night with massive projections exposing Shell's horrendous track record in the Arctic and around the world.</p>
<p>Help us make the People's Platform a reality. It's going to help unite folks from all over the Salish Sea who care about the climate. We're creating a powerful  platform (literally) for those who don't want to stand on the sidelines while the Pacific Northwest becomes an giant export corridor for dirty oil, gas, and coal.</p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p><b>$5: Deckhand</b><br/>Welcome aboard!  You'll be publicly listed on the Mosquito Fleet and Other 98% websites as an official crew-member of the People's Platform.<br/></p>
<p><b>$10: Give Shell Hell<br/></b>We blast your personal message to Shell onto our giant projection screen. The shorter and pithier your message, the better. Example: ""SUCK it Shell! ...but not outta the Arctic.""  Once you have made your contribution, send us a direct message on Indiegogo with some fresh hell for Shell.</p>

Look out Shell! You've got a new neighbor: The People's Platform. Last Friday we anchored the People's Platform in Elliott Bay just a few hundred yards from Terminal 5, Shell's new base of operations. We were at the center of the Paddle in Seattle kayak armada and were honored to host dozens of Coast Salish nations from the Pacific Northwest for a Native American jam session and speak out against Shell on our stage. In a direct rebuke to Shell's massive drill rig, Polar Pioneer, folks have begun referring to the People's Platform as the Solar Pioneer. Until Shell leaves port we'll be lighting up the nights, projecting videos and elevating the voices of folks from all over the world who take issue with Shell's destructive practices. Please chip into our Indiegogo and help us keep the People's Platform shining brightly on the water, bearing witness to Shell's crimes against the climate. Thanks!!

 The Lowdown
Shell is bringing its oil rigs into Seattle before heading up to the Arctic Ocean to begin exploratory drilling this summer.
So, we want to show Shell what safe energy production REALLY looks like. That's why we're constructing the ""People's Platform"", a floating showcase of energy solutions that are a whole lot less STUPID than Shell's proposed drilling plan.
We're turning an ordinary marine barge into the People's Platform with solar panels and wind turbines to energize our incredible show of people power. We'll light up the night with massive projections exposing Shell's horrendous track record in the Arctic and around the world.
Help us make the People's Platform a reality. It's going to help unite folks from all over the Salish Sea who care about the climate. We're creating a powerful  platform (literally) for those who don't want to stand on the sidelines while the Pacific Northwest becomes an giant export corridor for dirty oil, gas, and coal.
Perks
$5: DeckhandWelcome aboard!  You'll be publicly listed on the Mosquito Fleet and Other 98% websites as an official crew-member of the People's Platform.
$10: Give Shell HellWe blast your personal message to Shell onto our giant projection screen. The shorter and pithier your message, the better. Example: ""SUCK it Shell! ...but not outta the Arctic.""  Once you have made your contribution, send us a direct message on Indiegogo with some fresh hell for Shell.
$25: Mosquito Fleet Sticker
The Mosquito Fleet is a volunteer armada of kayaktivsts that are swarming against Global Warming in the Salish Sea. Get your sticker and fly the flag, mateys!!

In this way, they can continue to be stewards of the forests, ensuring the health of the planet. Once an indigenous community has been disrupted by extractive industries, they are often left with no means to adjust to a new way of life and are unable to continue to live solely in their traditional way. Our work supports their culture, livelihood and self-determination. We develop lasting relationships and work in collaboration with artisans to ensure their needs are addressed. We co-create and bring to the world beautiful traditional and contemporary collections of fine organic and handmade Amazon eco fashions, accessories and home products made with sustainable rainforest materials, based on each community's traditional artistry. We currently work with the Cofán in Ecuador and the Awajún in Perú. <a href=""http://orgbyvio.com/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.orgbyvio.com</a> <br/><br/>Your support makes our mission possible, as we grow organically and address the needs of the artisans and communities.<br/><br/>

<div>CONTRIBUTIONS ARE ACCEPTED WORLDWIDE.<br/><br/>
</div>
<h3>Our Work &amp; Mission</h3>
<div>• Assess a community's strengths and traditional livelihood to jointly develop a sustainable industry based on their traditional artistry. <br/><br/>• Set up traditionally built facilities for artisans to have a place to develop and produce their goods. <br/><br/>• Work with indigenous Amazon artisans to develop products and open markets that generate a sustainable economy for the communities, while protecting their culture and rainforests. <br/><br/>• Design and develop products based on their traditional arts and local materials. <br/><br/>• Train in quality and production to ensure consistency. <br/><br/>• Train in business and marketing to run their own businesses independently. <br/><br/>• Train in computer and internet. <br/><br/>• Supply communities with materials, laptops, internet, electricity through sustainable sources, etc., where needed and available. <br/><br/>• Fund production of goods. <br/><br/>• Pay artisans a fair wage for samples and production of goods, as well as share 50% of profits from the sale of goods (after all costs and expenses) with producing communities to use in varied ways through projects that enhance their livelihood, while maintaining their cultural identity. <br/><br/>• Connect with luxury markets and designers looking to source the artisans' work for their collections. <br/><br/>• Exhibit and sell collections and traditional goods through wholesale, trade shows and our online Shop. <br/><br/>• Ensure that artisans and youth continue cultivating their arts and culture. <br/><br/>• Promote the protection of indigenous Amazon culture and the rainforest within the communities, domestically and abroad. <br/><br/>• Share sustainable solutions that harmonize with indigenous Amazon culture to enhance their way of life and address a community's needs.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We work with women-run artisan associations in the Amazon. Their success impacts their lives, that of their families and communities by using their own creative resources to generate sustainable means to address their needs and thrive in their own communities.</p>
<p>Their success in their own communities also means that they can live where they feel most alive, surrounded by nature and ancestral wisdom they have protected for centuries.<br/><br/>Protected Amazon rainforests benefit all of us and the planet.<br/><br/></p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://www.perunature.com/info.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rainforest Expeditions</a></strong> is a recipient of The Rainforest Alliance 2012 Sustainable Standard-Setter award. This Peruvian ecotourism company shares with visitors in a sustainable manner the miracles of the Tambopata-Candamo Reserved Zone, 1.5 million hectares of pristine, still wild, tropical rainforest encompassing an area of land the size of Connecticut and stretching from the Andean highlands to the Amazon lowlands. It includes the Tambopata National Reserve, a 275,000-hectare conservation unit created by the Peruvian government in 1990 to protect the watersheds of the Tambopata and Candamo rivers. It is adjacent to the 1-million-hectare Bahuaja Sonene National Park. Conservation and ecotourism is helping to protect some of the last untouched lowland and premontane tropical humid forests in the Amazon.</p>
<p>Since 1989, guests of first one and now three Rainforest Expedition eco-lodges have added value to the region’s standing tropical rainforest. A sensitively conceived and managed (in some cases by native communities) touristic infrastructure creates a competitive alternative to such unsustainable economic uses as clear cutting the forest for timber or for cattle grazing. The partnerships Rainforest Expeditions has forged with local people eager to share Amazonian traditions with guests provide connection, expertise, adventure and access to wildlife in the jungles of Tambopata. Rainforest Expeditions has been verified and certified “a sustainable tourism business” by the <a href=""http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">Rainforest Alliance</a>. <a href=""http://www.perunature.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.perunature.com</a></p>
</div></div>","Our work helps create viable and environmentally sustainable economies for indigenous Amazon communities as an alternative to extractive industries. In this way, they can continue to be stewards of the forests, ensuring the health of the planet. Once an indigenous community has been disrupted by extractive industries, they are often left with no means to adjust to a new way of life and are unable to continue to live solely in their traditional way. Our work supports their culture, livelihood and self-determination. We develop lasting relationships and work in collaboration with artisans to ensure their needs are addressed. We co-create and bring to the world beautiful traditional and contemporary collections of fine organic and handmade Amazon eco fashions, accessories and home products made with sustainable rainforest materials, based on each community's traditional artistry. We currently work with the Cofán in Ecuador and the Awajún in Perú. www.orgbyvio.com Your support makes our mission possible, as we grow organically and address the needs of the artisans and communities.

The more funds we have to do our work, the more communities we can reach out to.
 
CONTRIBUTIONS ARE ACCEPTED WORLDWIDE.

Our Work & Mission
• Assess a community's strengths and traditional livelihood to jointly develop a sustainable industry based on their traditional artistry. • Set up traditionally built facilities for artisans to have a place to develop and produce their goods. • Work with indigenous Amazon artisans to develop products and open markets that generate a sustainable economy for the communities, while protecting their culture and rainforests. • Design and develop products based on their traditional arts and local materials. • Train in quality and production to ensure consistency. • Train in business and marketing to run their own businesses independently. • Train in computer and internet. • Supply communities with materials, laptops, internet, electricity through sustainable sources, etc., where needed and available. • Fund production of goods. • Pay artisans a fair wage for samples and production of goods, as well as share 50% of profits from the sale of goods (after all costs and expenses) with producing communities to use in varied ways through projects that enhance their livelihood, while maintaining their cultural identity. • Connect with luxury markets and designers looking to source the artisans' work for their collections. • Exhibit and sell collections and traditional goods through wholesale, trade shows and our online Shop. • Ensure that artisans and youth continue cultivating their arts and culture. • Promote the protection of indigenous Amazon culture and the rainforest within the communities, domestically and abroad. • Share sustainable solutions that harmonize with indigenous Amazon culture to enhance their way of life and address a community's needs.


The Impact
We work with women-run artisan associations in the Amazon. Their success impacts their lives, that of their families and communities by using their own creative resources to generate sustainable means to address their needs and thrive in their own communities.
Their success in their own communities also means that they can live where they feel most alive, surrounded by nature and ancestral wisdom they have protected for centuries.Protected Amazon rainforests benefit all of us and the planet.

Ecotribal's basic mission is to collaborate with indigenous peoples in a way that provides them with an income from sustainable products that support their culture and autonomy as well as territorial and environmental integrity.
Ecotribal has been established in 2004 after a long period of gestation, including 28 years traveling and working in South America, accumulating experience in anthropology, sustainable development, teaching, tourism and journalism. This work has led to strong direct links to rainforest communities, particularly in the Peruvian Amazon. www.ecotribal.comTambopata Research Center, Rainforest Expeditions $1,500+Click on Parrot Clay Lick photo below to watch on YouTube or watch in the Gallery tab above.

Rainforest Expeditions is a recipient of The Rainforest Alliance 2012 Sustainable Standard-Setter award. This Peruvian ecotourism company shares with visitors in a sustainable manner the miracles of the Tambopata-Candamo Reserved Zone, 1.5 million hectares of pristine, still wild, tropical rainforest encompassing an area of land the size of Connecticut and stretching from the Andean highlands to the Amazon lowlands. It includes the Tambopata National Reserve, a 275,000-hectare conservation unit created by the Peruvian government in 1990 to protect the watersheds of the Tambopata and Candamo rivers. It is adjacent to the 1-million-hectare Bahuaja Sonene National Park. Conservation and ecotourism is helping to protect some of the last untouched lowland and premontane tropical humid forests in the Amazon.
Since 1989, guests of first one and now three Rainforest Expedition eco-lodges have added value to the region’s standing tropical rainforest. A sensitively conceived and managed (in some cases by native communities) touristic infrastructure creates a competitive alternative to such unsustainable economic uses as clear cutting the forest for timber or for cattle grazing. The partnerships Rainforest Expeditions has forged with local people eager to share Amazonian traditions with guests provide connection, expertise, adventure and access to wildlife in the jungles of Tambopata. Rainforest Expeditions has been verified and certified “a sustainable tourism business” by the Rainforest Alliance. www.perunature.com",24.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>La Tortuga Viva (‘Living Turtle’ in Spanish) is a sea turtle sanctuary on the southern Pacific coast of Mexico run by 14 volunteers from the local community of Juluchuca, Guerrero, Mexico. La Tortuga Viva works for the preservation of 3 endangered sea turtles species - the Olive Ridley, the Leatherback (highly endangered) and the Black Turtle. The volunteers vigilantly patrol the beach every night of the year and safely transplant the vulnerable turtle eggs that would otherwise get stolen by poachers (people), devoured by predators (dogs, badgers and other animals) or washed away by high tide. Relocating nests into the sanctuary is crucial to the survival of these baby sea turtles.</p>
<p>The camp runs on donations from visitors to the area, however, it is not enough. The local volunteers have been clearing the new area (just across from the old one) for weeks and are ready to get started on constructing the new sanctuary ahead of the peak nesting season starting in July. </p>

Stretching over 6.5 million acres, the Leuser Ecosystem is a vast, teeming, ancient landscape on the island of Sumatra and considered to be one of the most important forests left in Southeast Asia. But this priceless ecosystem is under assault right now by Conflict Palm Oil. The most widely used vegetable oil in the world, palm oil can be found in over half of all packaged goods in a local supermarket. The blind growth in demand for palm oil has recklessly pushed massive, industrial-scale plantations into the heart of Indonesia's rainforests, including the Leuser Ecosystem.</p>

Wildlife Asia is teaming up with Racing Extinction, Oceanic Preservation Society (OPS) and Rainforest Action Network (RAN) to launch Racing Extinction in the Leuser Ecosystem, a bold mission to shine a global spotlight on the destruction of the last place on Earth where orangutans, rhinos, tigers, and elephants still live together in the wild, and produce the tools that will enable action to save it. 
#SaveLeuserEcosystemThe Leuser Ecosystem is a global priority for tropical forest protection. Stretching over 6.5 million acres, the Leuser Ecosystem is a vast, teeming, ancient landscape on the island of Sumatra and considered to be one of the most important forests left in Southeast Asia. But this priceless ecosystem is under assault right now by Conflict Palm Oil. The most widely used vegetable oil in the world, palm oil can be found in over half of all packaged goods in a local supermarket. The blind growth in demand for palm oil has recklessly pushed massive, industrial-scale plantations into the heart of Indonesia's rainforests, including the Leuser Ecosystem.

#CutConflictPalmOil

Public outcry has convinced many of the world’s biggest companies to commit to cut Conflict Palm Oil, but the fact is these paper promises alone will not stop the imminent threat of extinction eating away at the Leuser Ecosystem. We are in a race against time, but together we will turn this around. By naming names and exposing the actors destroying the #LastPlaceOnEarth, we will hold corporations accountable for their actions, inspire the world to take action to #CutConflictPalmOil and protect the Leuser Ecosystem for generations to come. 

We have a plan!
Right now there is a diverse team comprised of the world's most talented investigators, communicators, videographers and corporate campaigners ready to go undercover and expose the culprits driving extinction in the Leuser Ecosystem. We can’t do this alone. We need you to have our back. 


#StartWith1Thing
With your help we will raise $50,000- these funds are needed to provide essential equipment to enable our team to conduct field investigations and expose the culprits on the frontlines of forest destruction. The team will follow the supply chain so that we can expose the connections between this destruction and the irresponsible practices of brands that use Conflict Palm Oil in their products stocked in our supermarkets. We will bring the fight to protect the Leuser Ecosystem to the global stage, and with your help we will stop extinction in its tracks. With your help, we will WIN. 

Join usJoin us now as this story unfolds, sign up for our newsletter, like us on facebook, follow us on Twitter, tell your friends about Racing Extinction in the Leuser Ecosystem and dig deep to give as much as you can give to this critical mission, every dollar counts.  
If we exceed our goal, additional funds will go toward scaling up research and increasing global action against Conflict Palm Oil as we fight to promote, protect and restore the Leuser Ecosystem. 
The threats are real and the stakes couldn’t be higher, and we can’t turn this around without your help.
Join us.

<p><strong>City water is unsafe:</strong> Imagine wanting to wash your hands in your house but can’t because the water is filthy due sewer lines mixing with the water pipes. You can’t drink such water.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
In Malawi, 30,000 people die every year because of waterborne diseases. That includes Diarrhea, Cholera, you name it.
Crystal Water Solutions offers affordable clean water solutions for homes and communities in Malawi.
During the British protectorate, the British set up a primitive plumbing structure designed for small, limited communities. After independence, instead of modernizing the plumbing system, our government took that rudimentary structure and made it the standard. This has come back to bite us. 50 years later!
City water is unsafe: Imagine wanting to wash your hands in your house but can’t because the water is filthy due sewer lines mixing with the water pipes. You can’t drink such water.
Home developers can’t get water immediately: Imagine if you were building a house outside the business district and having to wait a year or more to get access to water. Even after that, the water is unsafe.
Most Villages don’t have access to safe water. They take their water from unprotected streams and shallow boreholes.
So we are going to solve this water problem in 3 ways

Provide water filtration products
Well repairs for villages
Drilling wells for new development and villages

Bottled water is expensive and makes people dependent. Our bio-sand filters are economical and very efficient. Our filter makes water 99.9% bacteria free and safe for drinking. On top of that, our filters can last up to 10 years!
Crystal Water is an award-winning clean water solutions company, started by four Malawian businessmen. We grew up with these water dangers. We are familiar with the most urgent needs and have experience drilling wells. We offer Malawians safe water, education and independence to maintain it themselves.
We are optimistic in our financial projections showing profits in our first year.
With the prize money that we got from Oxford University for winning Project ENSIGO’s business competition, we are going to register our company and process necessary documentation by October 2017.
What We Need 
We need $30,000:

$14k: buying a portable drill rig, safety work kits, equipment to make our bio-sand filters.
$7k: will be invested in creating and buying inventory
$9k: Operation costs for the first year

If we do not reach our entire goal, we shall start but at the less desired level.
For every 1$ you give, you contribute to saving a life off that 30,000 people that die every year because of waterborne diseases.
The Impact
Our 5-year goal is to make safe water accessible to the million people living in the capital of Malawi. When this is achieved, we will then go to the rest of Malawi.

Each dollar contributed is a brick laid down to make sure that we build this vision and save lives in Malawi.
Our business model won an Oxford University funded business competition, and was thought to be the most promising and most likely to roll out.

Risks & Challenges
Most people in Malawi are still new to water filtration technologies. They would need to be convinced that they’re in need of water filters. However,
Our team is innovative in marketing strategy. All founding members have had formal business training and have designed a well thought branding exercise at the start of 2018.
We will educate and sell our filters using our door-to-door marketing campaign.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Sign up for our newsletters and blog on <a href=""http://www,naturesfootfall.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">naturesfootfall.org</a> </p>
<p>This PROJECT, because it is being done at a time when International Organizations are focused on a sustainable future for food and farming; and that for the first time small farmers are being given a voice in how the future can look. Our template to how farmer can be funded without bank loans etc. is very important, You will be part of a massive change. Our website will have a founders page (apart from the picture galley etc. ) once a name is entered there..it is there for posterity.</p>
<ul>
<li>The pilot project here will not only ensure this valley will be secured as farming and woodland. Biodiversity for wild life and sustainable food.But, it will also be a place used for teaching at the same time as offering secure jobs for the local community . Beyond the local impact. The Carbon to Soil study , and study of soil regeneration and of that effect on the water cycle will be important for future projects in all areas of the world.</li>
<li>We already have interest from South Africa, South America, and India , in creating a similar community project surrounding small farmers. using our template.</li>
</ul>
<p>While neither my son nor myself have ever done a crowdfunding. To have the backing of such as EAT and encouragement from others in the business. We know our project is important, and they believe in us. Please help us turn this dream into a reality.</p>

Every thing is in place. The final KEY is the not for profit company registration! This background work -  is what I usually do for clients. This time WE are the client.  .</li>
<li> As my late Mentor used to say. We are now at a   position where ""there are now no longer any problems..there are only solutions!""</li>

Anyone contributing in the first  7 DAYS of this opening will also receive a very special ""surprise gift"".On confirmation of your contribution we will send a thank you notice and the details to the  special video  donated by Dr Wayne Dorband of the Institute of Ecolonomics.

The Impact
Sign up for our newsletters and blog on naturesfootfall.org 
This PROJECT, because it is being done at a time when International Organizations are focused on a sustainable future for food and farming; and that for the first time small farmers are being given a voice in how the future can look. Our template to how farmer can be funded without bank loans etc. is very important, You will be part of a massive change. Our website will have a founders page (apart from the picture galley etc. ) once a name is entered there..it is there for posterity.

The pilot project here will not only ensure this valley will be secured as farming and woodland. Biodiversity for wild life and sustainable food.But, it will also be a place used for teaching at the same time as offering secure jobs for the local community . Beyond the local impact. The Carbon to Soil study , and study of soil regeneration and of that effect on the water cycle will be important for future projects in all areas of the world.
We already have interest from South Africa, South America, and India , in creating a similar community project surrounding small farmers. using our template.

While neither my son nor myself have ever done a crowdfunding. To have the backing of such as EAT and encouragement from others in the business. We know our project is important, and they believe in us. Please help us turn this dream into a reality.

Risks & Challenges


 With any project to do with land, there are always the possibilities of hitting a problem. I have spent the last 18 months talking to government offices, land owners and International bodies. 99% of the possible problems, with their assistance, have been looked at and we have negotiated a way forward. Every thing is in place. The final KEY is the not for profit company registration! This background work -  is what I usually do for clients. This time WE are the client.  .
 As my late Mentor used to say. We are now at a   position where ""there are now no longer any problems..there are only solutions!""

We use cinematic language to communicate a wide range of messages of social and political context at a growing and expanding audience.------THE BILLRight now the Greek government is preparingthe second version of a bill to sell off public beaches to private companies. According to this bill, Greece will be left with cemented, overdeveloped beaches and access will only be allowed to those who can afford it.In its current form the draft law would allow unrestricted exploitation of what is widely regarded as one of the most unspoiled coastlines on the continent of Europe: simplifying building permits for beachside hotels; allowing businesses to pay fines to legalize buildings deemed illicit and permitting vendors to litter shorelines with umbrellas and sunbeds. Free access to public beaches, a right enshrined in the Greek constitution and mentality, would also be severely limited.Finally, the rich but vulnerable biodiversity of the coastal areas is at risk with this bill as it could convert protected areas into lots for sale and constitutes a violation of natural resources with serious environmental consequences.-----THE CAMPAIGN When the bill was proposed there was a first successful movement against it based on petitions and awareness actions that managed to freeze the bill, but not scrap it altogether. Knowing that many governments use the period of summer to pass laws in an unperceivable way, we realized it is our turn to act as conscious citizens. We feel the urge to use our craft to widen and enhance these actions with the means we have at hand.

Continental Divide, and its centerpiece is Waterton-Glacier International Peace
Park, a union of Canada’s Waterton Lakes National Park and Glacier National
Park in the United States. All told, the Crown holds 18 million acres of

<h3>Our Team</h3><p>Photographer <b>Steven Gnam</b> takes us into the very
heart and soul of the wildest Rockies. Having explored the area since he was a
young child, he’s traveled by foot,
ski, crampon, and bike—even at times snorkeling alongside trout under
bone-chilling water—across thousands of miles to showcase the wild spirit of
one of the last vestiges of the North American west.  Steven’s photographs have been used by
conservation organizations across the west, including the Nature Conservancy,
NPCA, and the Montana Wilderness Association. His work has been featured by
commercial and editorial clients, such as Patagonia, Backpacker Magazine,
National Parks, and Montana Outdoors. Steven lives with his wife, Alyson, in
the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Wildlife biologist <b>Douglas H. Chadwick </b>has
traveled the globe reporting on wildlife and conservation, from the Congo
headwaters to Siberia to the Great Barrier Reef. He is the critically acclaimed
author of <i>The Fate of the Elephant, A Beast the Color of Winter, </i>and <i>True
Grizz</i>, as well as <i>The Company We Keep: America’s Endangered Species
and Enduring America. </i>Over two hundred of his articles have appeared
in such publications as <i>National Geographic</i>, to which he is a
frequent contributor, <i>Audubon, Defenders of Wildlife</i>, and <i>Smithsonian
Magazine</i>. A longtime conservationist, Chadwick spent seven years studying
mountain goats and other wildlife in Montana’s Bob Marshall Wilderness and
Glacier National Park. He lives with his family in northwestern Montana. He
contributes an essay on the area’s astonishing biodiversity and close proximity
to vibrant communities, and will join Steven to present at several events.</p>

What It Takes</b></h3>
<p>If you’ve ever thrown a party, you know that hosting an
event can be time-consuming and expensive. Sometimes you wonder if all the
effort is worth it, right? But inevitably you will throw another party. <u>Because
getting people together and sharing something you have in common is really rewarding.</u>  These shared experiences give us lasting
memories that make all the hassles worth it. Even if you do have to clean-up
afterwards.</p>
<p>Here at Braided River, we work hard to coordinate events
that change perspectives. We lure folks in with beautiful photos and
interesting stories; we send them home ready to become stewards working to
protect the landscape they’ve just travelled across through the presentation.  </p>
<p>To create <b>Crown of
the Continent</b>, we had an incredibly talented and hard-working team, and the
final product is an exquisite call to action to protect this special wild place.
(The Crown is home to more than 1,000 native plants, 70 mammals, and 260
species of birds!) You can help us make sure that plenty of people hear this
call, and respond to it! </p>
<p>Planning the events and coordinating with our partners takes
time, roughly $500 and $1,000 in staff time per event. Then there are the venue
rental expenses which range from $250 to $1,000+. Earning strong media coverage
and creating publicity materials takes more time (there’s another $1,000.) And,
then you have to get there; depending on where the event is and where our
authors happen to be and how many will attend this runs another to $250 to
$1,000.</p>
<p>So, you see, hosting a great public outreach event typically
runs us between $3, 500 and $5,000. And, it’s worth every penny when we send
400+ plus people home all geared up to protect wildlands and reach thousands
more through media coverage of the event. </p>

</div></div>","MISSION
The mission of ZUVUYA is to offer a sensory, multi-media experience focused on reconnecting us to our ocean home and to inspire stewardship and healing for the oceans and ourselves.

VISION
The vision of ZUVUYA is to merge science and art to increase awareness that the health of the ocean is critical to all life on earth, to inspire action to protect and sustain the ocean for future generations, and to catalyze community members to launch regional ocean initiatives.      www.zuvuyaproject.com                             

                          Photo of OCEAN Installation Kona Hawaii 2014
http://westhawaiitoday.com/news/local-news/underwater-understanding-multimedia-art-installation-increases-ocean-awareness



Zuvuya is the Mayan word for the circuit by which everything returns to its source, connecting memory to the future as well as the past.







WHO WE ARE 
We are a group of renowned international artists and scientists collaborating to increase awareness that the health of the ocean is
critical to all life on earth through bringing the beautiful and awe-inspiring sculpture installation OCEAN to seven locations on the Pacific Rim. 
Our project is a call for action to protect and sustain the
ocean for future generations. Contributions will help launch ZUVUYA on its Pacific Rim
Tour 2014 to inspire local citizen ocean-protection
initiatives.                              

THE ART: OCEAN LIVING SCULPTURE

A total immersion experience, OCEAN is comprised of huge sails stretching from floor to ceiling creating multi-layered shapes that surround viewers on all sides and overhead. Projected on the sails are Lisa Denning's extraordinary film images of whales and dolphins with Susan Alexjander's haunting bio-acoustic soundtrack of rare marine-life voices. 




THE SCIENCE & EDUCATION


Exhibits from each Pacific Rim location will accompany the installation. They will showcase the cultural relationships of each region, and their particular environmental challenges.

Howdy! My name is Luke McLaughlin. You might recognize me from the Discovery Channel's hit shows, ""Naked and Afraid"", and ""Naked and Afraid: XL"".  I have done well in these extreme survival challenges because I have dedicated my life to deep Nature connection and mastering indigenous skills.


 I believe ALL humans are meant to have a deep Nature connection.  
I have over 400 days of primitive living in the wild and my background as an educator has equipped me to help people reconnect to the land.  
My partner Natalie and I are starting Holistic Survival School (HSS). We are committed to helping people connect to Nature.


We need your help: we are planting our business near Grand Rapids, Michigan. We chose Grand Rapids because of the great community, and access to natural resources. 
 We will be purchasing land for HSS.  Your contribution will:
-Help bring a Nature based school to the Midwest/Michigan/Grand Rapids community
-Help children and adults learn how to live with a deep Nature connection
-Create a space for people to learn more about themselves and our natural environment. 
-Create a community of environmentally based thinkers


What We Need & What You Get
 The funding you contribute will go directly toward buying land to start Holistic Survival School. We have been searching for an ideal place to start HSS and have narrowed it down to a couple of plots.  The plots are 20-40 acres, contain old growth forests that are secluded, and are within 30 minutes of the Grand Rapids.

The Impact
 So what's the big deal?!  Why is this important to me?  
I truly believe that if we are to save life on this Earth and save ourselves as a species, we need to make some sudden, drastic changes.
This land will be the space where we as a community can return to the land.  The land will be the epicenter for learning tangible, earth-based skills that help us establish a relationship to Nature. 

Be the change you wish to see. Nature connection is critical! 
 Help the community shift from an ""ego-centric"" mindset to ""eco-centric""
Help people find wellness and wholeness in Nature
Inspire people to live in harmony with their surroundings
Re-establish a relationship with the local ecosystem

<p>We have a dream and with your help we intend to make it a reality.</p>
<p>Come and join us in creating a world first eco friendly castle in the Australian Outback which will comprise of a state of the art education facility for the local community in rural Northern Territory</p>
<p>Enthusiast in Castle Architecture, Neil Henson has found the perfect outback location for a castle in the Northern Territory of Australia which will house the education facility and we would love to share it with you all so jump on board and help us to create our dream</p>
<p>Why are we building an education facility?</p>
<p>The creation of this education facility is a lifelong dream of businessman Neil Henson, a retired soldier who brings a wealth of disciplined experience into his business activities. Neil has been acknowledged for his efforts by being presented 2 awards this year by the REINT for Innovation and communication ahead of 200 other Companies in the NT.</p>
<p>Neil says;</p>
<p>‘’This castle will provide classrooms for teachers and students with facilities for all to benefit from, the castle walls provide protection where everyone can enjoy our education facility as well as all of what the territory has to offer and feel completely safe at the same time. 100 new job opportunities will be created from this project and we intend to plant over 2000 trees to assist the sustainability of the area. Built using 21st century technology, the castle will consist of classic 14th-20th century design features built on Finniss River which will flow naturally around the castle walls.’’</p>
<p>There isn’t a location within 100km of the Darwin CBD for locals or visitors to go to a luxury outback (affordable) education facility or nature reserve in a retreat complex. The only choices are 2 star resorts or having to fly interstate or overseas.</p>
<p>This outback oasis will be a short 55 minute journey from the city of Darwin where you are surrounded by nature in this unique and wild area with lots to see and do!

</div></div>","We have a dream and with your help we intend to make it a reality.
Come and join us in creating a world first eco friendly castle in the Australian Outback which will comprise of a state of the art education facility for the local community in rural Northern Territory
Enthusiast in Castle Architecture, Neil Henson has found the perfect outback location for a castle in the Northern Territory of Australia which will house the education facility and we would love to share it with you all so jump on board and help us to create our dream
Why are we building an education facility?
The creation of this education facility is a lifelong dream of businessman Neil Henson, a retired soldier who brings a wealth of disciplined experience into his business activities. Neil has been acknowledged for his efforts by being presented 2 awards this year by the REINT for Innovation and communication ahead of 200 other Companies in the NT.
Neil says;
‘’This castle will provide classrooms for teachers and students with facilities for all to benefit from, the castle walls provide protection where everyone can enjoy our education facility as well as all of what the territory has to offer and feel completely safe at the same time. 100 new job opportunities will be created from this project and we intend to plant over 2000 trees to assist the sustainability of the area. Built using 21st century technology, the castle will consist of classic 14th-20th century design features built on Finniss River which will flow naturally around the castle walls.’’
There isn’t a location within 100km of the Darwin CBD for locals or visitors to go to a luxury outback (affordable) education facility or nature reserve in a retreat complex. The only choices are 2 star resorts or having to fly interstate or overseas.
This outback oasis will be a short 55 minute journey from the city of Darwin where you are surrounded by nature in this unique and wild area with lots to see and do! It truly is ‘Beauty and the Beast’ with its vast bushland and landscape views, rivers teeming with crocodiles and other animals such as wild horses and boars, kangaroos and wallabies, birds and insects. The birdlife is extraordinary and the nature land near to the castle has wading birds and a large variety of finches, kingfishers and bee eaters to name just a few.
Be a part of it and help support us in building a world first! Keep an eye on us during construction with webcam views and on completion we welcome you to come and see what you have helped create!
Every little helps and if you don’t want to purchase a tier option highlighted we appreciate any support at all so please share with all of your friends, any donation big or small will assist us to achieve our goal!

<h3>Promoting honey production in rural Zambia</h3>
<p>The iAfrica Foundation supports sustainable development in rural Zambia. Through our ZayoHub project (<a href=""http://www.zayohub.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.zayohub.com</a>), we are working with communities in the remotest parts of the country. Both iAfrica and ZayoHub are non-profits, focused on using market based approaches and social enterprise to achieve development goals. </p>
<p>Honey production is a great option for villagers in the south-west of Zambia. Honey generates a good income, while preserving the extensive hardwood (teak) forests. The great taste of our organic forest honey is popular in European and US markets, and the potential for expansion is vast. There are few other good options for improving local incomes, especially as climate change means that annual rainfall is increasingly unreliable. </p>
<p>Traditional methods mean that a tree is felled for every traditional bark hive. The population is scattered through extensive forests, and have always had ample access to timber products. But as we promote increased honey production, this needs to change. The hidden environmental cost of expansion is otherwise too high to contemplate. The women and men we train in bee keeping and honey production will be obliged to adopt the use of improved hives, made from wood from sustainable forests, to engage with our programme. </p>
<p>Honey adds significantly to household earnings, without a huge demand for labour. It's not hard, and there is already considerable traditional knowledge. Someone who own five hives can expect to earn the equivalent of half a years' supply of staple food for a family of five; as they scale up, there is ample opportunity to build a good income. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In the first year, we want to train 250 women and men, and get them started with two hives each. The improved hives cost £20 each, so that's £10,000 in all.</p>
<p>The villagers are not inclined to spend £40 each on improved hives - they can just as well cut down trees, and that money (if they have it) is needed for other basic needs. On the other hand, we don't want to hand out hives for free; we can't afford to do that, and it's generally not the right way to go. </p>
<p>So we are looking for support to help get the farmers going. </p>
<p>For each £20: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The new honey producer</strong> gets the hive, which belongs to him / her for as long as they remain enrolled in the programme*</li>
<li>
<strong>The iAfrica Foundation</strong> will train the producers, visit them regularly, and provide a market for their money</li>
<li>
<strong>The funder</strong> (you!) will get a delicious pot of honey, sent to you by post, from the first harvest. </li>
<li><strong>And a tree is not cut down </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><i>(* We retain the right to reallocate the hive if the farmer ceases to producing honey)</i></p>
<p><i><strong>Sponsoring more than one hive?</strong></i> We'll send you a pot of honey for every hive you sponsor, plus a bonus pot too! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The project brings benefits at every level: </p>
<ul>
<li>The producer gets to build a new, sustainable, climate change resilient livelihood</li>
<li>The hardwood forest is preserved, with local and global benefits</li>
<li>The Zambian economy benefits from increased exports</li>
<li>The consumer enjoys delicious healthy organic honey</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The local producer needs to expand his / her business. The global community needs the forests to be preserved. This opportunity is about sharing the costs of conserving the forest, by helping impoverished communities to adopt </strong><b>sustainable hives. </b></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Overcoming Challenges</h3>
<p>There are many challenges to working in rural Zambia. It is remote, roads are poor, and communications can be difficult. Fortunately, our team has been working in Zambia for many years, and we have built relations with the local community. We can never say there won't be challenges, but we can certainly say that we have ample experience in getting our diverse projects and programmes to work. </p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>The road to <a href=""https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Silver_Star_Mountain_Hike"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Silver Star Trailhead</a> is in woeful disrepair. Massive ruts keep most passenger cars from reaching the trailhead, cutting off access to the beautiful sub-alpine meadows and ridges of Silver Star Mountain. Hoping to one day take his sons hiking up the mountain he loved,  in 2019 Jeremy VanGelder arranged two volunteer workdays to fix the road, and Friends of Road 4109 was born.</p>
<p>Last year we proved that volunteers <i>can</i> repair a road by creating waterbars and filling potholes along a 1/2 mile stretch of the road. This year our goal is to improve another mile of the road and lay gravel to preserve our improvements.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>Volunteer road repair is hard work. But the list of necessary supplies is pretty simple. We rent traffic control devices, we buy diesel for our tractors, and then we pay for gravel to be delivered to the site. If we reach our funding goal of $1,000, we will be able to buy about 30 tons of gravel to place on the road.</p>
<p>When you show the world that you are a Friend of Road 4109 you will receive one of a variety of items picturing the outline of Silver Star Mountain. All artwork is courtesy of <a href=""https://mythrosstudios.weebly.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mythros Studios.</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any construction project, safety needs to be a priority when working with machinery. This is why we rent traffic control equipment and implement safety briefings before every work event.</p>
<p>We don't know what the weather will be or how COVID-19 may change how we are able to interact. We are prepared to implement social distancing measures and will keep our schedule fluid. If we are unable to do the project, we will donate all profits from this campaign to <a href=""https://www.wta.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Washington Trails Association</a> and <a href=""https://www.cffr.us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Citizens for Forest Roads</a>. If we don't reach our goal of $1,000, we will not be able to buy gravel. But the money raised in the campaign will cover diesel and rentals of safety equipment.</p>

<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""><h3 style="""">What is mBoo?</h3>
<div><div>mBoo is a line of ultra soft and environmentally friendly toilet paper made from natural bamboo fiber.</div></div></span></h3>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Every year, Americans waste more than 5 million trees on toilet paper alone. While recycled toilet paper has always been an option, they've never been widely available on the market due to their lack of popularity. This is because recycled toilet paper is often harsh and gives off an unsanitary impression. </p>
<p>The solution to this problem is <b>bamboo</b>. Bamboo is one of the world's most abundant and easily renewable resources because it is able to reach a maturity height of 75 feet in a matter of two months. The process of manufacturing toilet paper is also environmentally friendly and, thanks to some of bamboo's basic properties, yields an <b>ultra soft</b> end product. </p>
<p></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Since bamboo is primarily grown in developing countries, bamboo made products will bring notable economic improvements to those countries and communities. For example, the farmers of bamboo farms in Moganshan, China, are seeing their annual incomes grow at a 20% rate thanks to the growing demand for bamboo. Their lives serve as hope for many poor bamboo farmers in other parts of China, South Asia, as well as Africa. <br/></p>
<p>So make a difference, and advocate for bamboo.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We are asking for a total of $20,000 to help us bring this product to the general market. With this money, we would be able to conduct the proper research and development, secure a contract with a trusting manufacturer, and pitch the product to major retail outlets. </p>
<p>Here's a more detailed look at how your money will be spent:</p>
<p>1. Web developer to create a retail website for mBoo</p>
<p>2. Consultant to find proper manufacturing partner and to help develop mBoo product line.</p>
<p>3. Legal fees</p>
<p>4. Advertising fees</p>
<p>5. Purchasing final products</p>

</div></div>","My name is Xiuhtezcatl Martinez and I am an indigenous eco hip hop activist and the Youth Director of Earth Guardians. As a 14-year-old growing up in Colorado, I’ve seen the effects of climate change firsthand. Youth from around the world know that climate change is the defining issue of our time, and our generation will be the most affected. Many of us feel despair when it comes to dealing with climate change because we don't know where to start. We are ready to contribute to the solution, we just need the tools, confidence and momentum to get started.






The Opportunity

Our schools are not offering us the kind of education we need to deal with the world we are going to be left with. RYSE (Rising Youth for a Sustainable Earth) a project of Earth Guardians will train young solutionaries to take a leadership role in the climate movement instead of waiting for others to lead. RYSE trainings will give youth the tools, skills and support to implement sustainable projects and transform their communities. This is an opportunity for youth to turn fear and despair about the kind of world they are inheriting into momentum and progress. Your contribution will help over 500 youth become active climate leaders.

The Vision


Empowered young leaders will lead projects, campaigns, and collective actions that disrupt the global leadership status quo. We will prove that our generation is not interested in waiting for others to take action. We are the ones we’ve been waiting for.

We will share our progress at the UN Climate Talks in Paris in December of 2015, demonstrating that we will protect our future no matter what. Our message to world leaders: JOIN US!

RYSE Councils



The RYSE Youth Council is made up of 13 exceptional youth leaders from diverse backgrounds We are still welcoming applications for the Youth Council.
The Youth Council will develop their skills as organizers, facilitators, and community leaders while working together as the principal decision makers for the RYSE movement. 
The RYSE Wisdom Council is made up of 13 seasoned leaders and activists from diverse geographic, ethnic, cultural, and socioeconomic backgrounds. With experience in arts, sciences, social justice, movement-building, and climate solutions, this multifaceted council will support the youth-led shift toward a healthy, just and sustainable planet.

Phase 1: Wildfire Training
In March of 2015, the impressive movement builders of the Wildfire Project will facilitate 4 days of workshops and trainings for the RYSE Youth Council. Wildfire is a democratic, front lines, action-oriented team of organizers and facilitators. They recognize times of crisis as vital opportunities for improving life on earth. They fuse political education, skills training, group development, and direct organizing. Their team leader is the global trainer for 350.org. They have supported a diverse range of social and ecological justice movements: from Tar Sands Action and PowerShift to Dream Defenders and the Divest Student Network. The training will take place around the third weekend in March at Frost Valley in the Catskill Mountains.




Phase 2: RYSE and Shine

In April of 2015, Youth Council Leaders will unite to collectively carry out and lead an organized national action: RYSE and Shine. This powerful, unified action will mobilize and inspire participants in addition to jump-starting the momentum of the movement.

Phase 4: Activation

Time to RYSE! Leaders and communities will put their climate solutions into action. Shovels will be in soil planting trees and gardens, solar panels will cover school rooftops, and new solar-powered lights will line park sidewalks. We anticipate ingenuity and never-before-seen solutions. Youth leaders will discover the creative, collaborative leaders within. With the tools and connections from RYSE, youth will recognize themselves as leaders, catalysts for change and a part of our greater global community.

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><span style=""font-size: small;""><strong>The use of coral friendly HELIX sand screws solves these issues</strong>.</span></span></p>

<p class=""p1""><span style=""font-size: small;""><br/></span>The Helix Anchoring system is a worldwide tried and proven method of anchoring in ecological sensitive marine areas. The Helix system offers many unique advantages over the traditional methods of using concrete blocks or permanently drilled anchors in rock or other hard substrata found in coral areas.<br/><br/></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">These Advantages Include:<br/></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>1</strong>. <strong>Easy to install. </strong> The Helix anchor can be installed from a small (&lt; 4M) boat with a draught of less than 30 cm. Weighted anchors require the use of a barge and crane that is able to lift the weight of the block. The draught of such vessel may be several meters when taking the leaning factor when the weight is being lowered to the seabed. Many of the corals in Pattaya are in shallow water areas and may not have the necessary depth to carry out the concrete anchor installation without damaging the corals.<br/><br/></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>2.</strong> <strong>A small footprint with a large holding capacity.</strong> Traditional concrete or weighted ground tackle requires large areas of the seabed to be covered by the weight material. For example a 5 ton concrete anchor requires almost a 2m sq of seabed to be consumed by the anchor after installation. This means that 2m sq of seabed area will be lost and all sessile benthic animal residing there will be killed. A 5 ton Helix anchor only requires an area of 30 cm diameter during installation and 4 cm diameter after the installation. <br/><br/></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>3. Centimeter accuracy when it comes to location.</strong> </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Divers in the water can safely install the Helix anchor on the seabed with centimeter accuracy. This is very important to ensure the anchor does not damage any corals during installation. Since a lot of corals in Pattaya’s reefs do not stop abruptly but rather thin out at their perimeters, most of the anchors will need installment among coral colonies. Such accurate placement would be almost impossible using large concrete blocks. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><br/></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">These Buoys will be fitted with an Anti Theft design and protected by Thai maritime law. </span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Project Budget</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: medium;""><br/></span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">The budget for the project as a whole is $100,000 usd and in simple terms breaks down like this:</span>  </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The install equipment for Square Shaft anchors includes:</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">(1) submersible torque motor             $5,000.00 USD  (150,000 Baht) Paid</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">(1) portable hydraulic power pack      $4,000 USD  (120,000 Baht) Paid</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">(1) paired hydraulic hose (75')             $1,500.00 USD   (45,000 Baht) Paid </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>All the above items have been paid for by our sponsor.</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><br/></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We now require 50 Helix Sand Screws with Buoys, Line and Tackle. <br/>Each Buoy will cost in the region of 1,000 usd which brings the total value of buoys alone to $50,000<br/>We also have to organise the logistics, divers, boats &amp; ongoing maintenance etc<br/><strong>If the campaign does not reach its target we will still be going ahead with the funds available to install the mooring buoys</strong></span></p>

About Us
Dive Tribe is a group of divers formed in 2009 to take care and educate the public in Thailand to the importance of our Marine Environment and how to protect and preserve it.
We now have a talented group of committed divers with a diverse range of talents drawn from a range of nationalities.
As a result of our campaigning efforts we currently have well over 11,000 active members, a figure which is growing daily, on social networking sites. Dive Tribe also has 35 partner stores in Thailand and total of 70 across Asia. They actively engage in our conservation projects .
Our innovative approaches to marine conservation have prompted growing and positive media interest in Asia, Europe and North America.
We worked very hard to secure sufficient funding to initiate a couple of smaller, but nonetheless important projects in the past 6 months.
The first involved the largest release of captive sharks in Asia. See Link: Here Our second, held over Chinese New Year, engaged 20 of our colleagues in diving with sharks at the Underwater World Marine Center here in Pattaya. The purpose was to wish several hundred visitors a Happy Chinese New Year, whilst asking them to take the pledge to abstain from consuming Shark Fin Soup. Again, this attracted a lot of public and media attention. See Link: Here
Why Are Coral Reefs Important ?

Coral reefs are among the oldest ecosystems on Earth.

Coral reefs support a phenomenal diversity of species and provide irreplaceable sources of food and shelter. Tropical rain forests play a similar role on the land.

Coral reef ecosystems support a variety of human needs. They are important for subsistence, fisheries, tourism, shoreline protection, and yield compounds that are important in the development of new medicines.

Coral reefs form natural barriers that protect nearby shorelines from the eroding forces of the sea, thereby protecting coastal dwellings, agricultural land and beaches.

Coral reefs have been used in the treatment of cancer, HIV, cardiovascular diseases, ulcers, and other ailments.

Although coral reefs cover less than 1% of the Earth’s surface, they are home to 25% of all marine fish species.At least 500 million people rely on coral reefs for food, coastal protection, and livelihoods
Estimates are that 20% of the world’s coral reefs have been effectively destroyed in the last few decades and an additional 20% or more are severely degraded, particularly in the Southeast Asia

Coral Reefs need our help and simply restoring the reefs doesn’t solve the problem of the constant damage and abuse that they suffer.

Anchor damage is the most preventable form of damage caused by humans. There is very little doubt that mooring buoys placed in coral areas reduce the amount of coral damage caused by anchors in these areas, in most cases by more than 80%Mooring buoys are also an important management tool in that they are useful in controlling the usage of certain areas by somewhat restricting the boat usage at the dive sites and encouraging boats to move to another site.We have observed and collected data that existing damage would benefit from the additions of fixed moorings. Dive Tribe have worked on and researched several systems and believe the Helix Ground Tackle with a marker buoy to be the best solution, it has proven its self suitable and has been installed in the Philippines, Egypt and Australia’s special coral areas. We are against using concrete blocks or tying straight to reefs as these in there own way have proved more damaging in the long run.The Project Equipment (see picture above)In the past the inclusion of mooring buoys into areas has often meant the use of unsightly concrete anchoring blocks or tying directly to reefs. There are several drawbacks with using large concrete weights as the ground tackle for mooring buoys. These include the area under the block, the degrading of the visual aesthetics of the area and the need for a large crane for deployment which is inaccurate and can damage the reefs below.Tying directly to reefs can also damage the reef it is trying to protect and is not recommended  

The use of coral friendly HELIX sand screws solves these issues.
They are small compact construction and when placed take only 20cm of space.Minimum Damage During InstallationImmovable Ground TackleAesthetically suitable for inclusion in Marine ParksReliable Easy & obvious to use5 Ton HoldingEasy To MaintainProven & used all over the world on some of the largest marine parks and marinas
The Helix Anchoring system is a worldwide tried and proven method of anchoring in ecological sensitive marine areas. The Helix system offers many unique advantages over the traditional methods of using concrete blocks or permanently drilled anchors in rock or other hard substrata found in coral areas.
These Advantages Include:
1. Easy to install.  The Helix anchor can be installed from a small (< 4M) boat with a draught of less than 30 cm. Weighted anchors require the use of a barge and crane that is able to lift the weight of the block. The draught of such vessel may be several meters when taking the leaning factor when the weight is being lowered to the seabed. Many of the corals in Pattaya are in shallow water areas and may not have the necessary depth to carry out the concrete anchor installation without damaging the corals.
2. A small footprint with a large holding capacity. Traditional concrete or weighted ground tackle requires large areas of the seabed to be covered by the weight material. For example a 5 ton concrete anchor requires almost a 2m sq of seabed to be consumed by the anchor after installation. This means that 2m sq of seabed area will be lost and all sessile benthic animal residing there will be killed. A 5 ton Helix anchor only requires an area of 30 cm diameter during installation and 4 cm diameter after the installation. 
3. Centimeter accuracy when it comes to location. 
Divers in the water can safely install the Helix anchor on the seabed with centimeter accuracy. This is very important to ensure the anchor does not damage any corals during installation. Since a lot of corals in Pattaya’s reefs do not stop abruptly but rather thin out at their perimeters, most of the anchors will need installment among coral colonies. Such accurate placement would be almost impossible using large concrete blocks. 

These Buoys will be fitted with an Anti Theft design and protected by Thai maritime law. 
 
 
 
 
The Project Budget

The budget for the project as a whole is $100,000 usd and in simple terms breaks down like this:  
The install equipment for Square Shaft anchors includes:
(1) submersible torque motor             $5,000.00 USD  (150,000 Baht) Paid
(1) portable hydraulic power pack      $4,000 USD  (120,000 Baht) Paid
(1) paired hydraulic hose (75')             $1,500.00 USD   (45,000 Baht) Paid 
All the above items have been paid for by our sponsor.

We now require 50 Helix Sand Screws with Buoys, Line and Tackle. Each Buoy will cost in the region of 1,000 usd which brings the total value of buoys alone to $50,000We also have to organise the logistics, divers, boats & ongoing maintenance etcIf the campaign does not reach its target we will still be going ahead with the funds available to install the mooring buoys

All we ask is if you believe coral reefs are worth saving please donate as much a you can spare.Every dollar the public give us will go towards buying the Helix Sand Screw and Buoy which will protect the reef.
We are also collecting sponsors from well known companies that have a corporate responsibility programme.A Company can sponsor a buoy for approx 1,000 usd and have its name/logo on that buoy and will receive regular updates on the reef below also that companies name will appear in all our international and national media outlets. Studies on these reefs after protection will be carried out by Students at Mahidol University Marine Biology Department.
 
So please help us protect the reefs, any donation however little will go towards preserving what we as divers and as human beings know is the life support system for this planet !

""Without the forest, there will be no more water, and without water, there will be no more rice.""







Deforestation and desertification threaten all of us. We're all in this together.





Each year, a forest as large as England is lost.


In 100 years, there might be no more rain forests.


Deforestation is speeding up climate change.


Up to 30,000 species may go extinct in the next 25 years.


Without trees, humans cannot survive.





What if you could transform our planet with the touch of a button?

Hundreds of jobs have been created, thousands of children's educations have been sponsored, and livelihoods enhanced by increased access to basic needs such as healthcare, water, food security and so much more... 



Our next mission is in the Congo Basin rainforest, an area that is in desperate need of conservation revolution! 
What We Need & What You Get

 Our goal is to raise $50,000+ (the more we raise, the more impact we can have in threatened forests)! Our unique perks range from a week long, once in a lifetime, wildlife immersion trip at our protection site in Kenya, to stylish merchandise made in our fair-trade eco-factory, to sponsoring children in Africa to experience their own wildlife.

Wildlife Works Graphic T-Shirt- $25







Wildlife Works' mission is to harness the power of the global consumer to create innovative and sustainable solutions for wildlife conservation.When you buy a Wildlife Works product, you become an agent for conservation. You're wearing the brand that says you won't sit quietly while forests disappear forever.
The jobs we create to make our products, and the money we invest into forest communities, has a direct impact on saving endangered and threatened forests and wildlife around the globe.

Offset Your Footprint- $50

We all have a carbon footprint that contributes to climate change. Do your part for the planet and offset the carbon footprint of an individual urban dweller for one year. 
Wildlife Immersion Trip- $1,500

Immerse yourself in the conservation revolution! Join us for a week long excursion at our conservation site in Kenya. Wildlife Works effectively protects 500,000 acres in the Kasigau Corridor, an African elephant migration route. Before Wildlife Works' involvement, this land connecting  two nature reserves was unprotected, leaving wilderness, and wildlife exposed to danger. In the past 5 years the area has seen conservation transformation through Wildlife Works' unique model. Want to see how we did it? Come to Kenya with us to learn, connect with wildlife, and experience the impact. *Airfare is not included*

The trip includes:




Transportation to/from Nairobi Intl. Airport


Private room with en suite bathroom and our eco-bed and breakfast


3 meals per day


Safari vehicle and tours


Guides & translators


Once in a lifetime experiences with local sustainable community initiatives




The Impact
 In a nutshell, our model makes protected forests more valuable alive then dead by creating a structure that works for local communities and governments. By incentivizing those who historically rely on deforestation for survival, we empower people to take a stand and protect forests that would otherwise be destroyed. Our work has:




Uplifted forest communities containing over 150,000 people


Protected over 1.2 million acres of endangered forests


Protected thousands species of wildlife, including African elephants

Prevented over 15 million tons of emissions from entering the atmosphere


Why The Congo Basin Rainforest?







Saving the Congo Basin rainforest is like saving one of the lungs of our planet. It is second in scale to the Amazon rainforest and rapidly disappearing.


The Congo Basin rainforest is home to thousands of endangered species that only exist there including gorillas, chimpanzees, forest elephants, various birds, shrew, fish, and amphibians that are invaluable to the ecosystem.


This threatened forest is essential to mitigating climate change for the world by affecting rainfall patterns across the North Atlantic as well as reducing ocean acidification and storing billions of tons of carbon from the atmosphere. 


Forest communities throughout these rainforests generate a flourishing economy that enhances their quality of life by monetizing conservation through this new model.

<p>In 1983, Dr. Mariam Raqib left Afghanistan as a child refugee. When she returned for the first time in 2003 she found her country devastated by war. The trees that she loved and had once played happily under had been wiped out.</p>
<p>Determined to make a difference she set out to replace the trees lost by war. For the past 4 years she has perfected the skills and established nurseries required to produce high quality saplings in increasingly large numbers. Now these skills and knowledge are ready to take a big investment and expand the project to other provinces of Afghanistan and a wide-scale reforesation effort.  </p>
<p>The Afghan Tree Project is a powerful and practical opportunity for everyone to help leave Afghanistan a better place, improving the environment, creating jobs and empowering women.  To do this we need your help. </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We need the funds to expand our nurseries which are the engine of the reforestation effort. By expanding the numbers of saplings produced we can provide fruit trees to individual families providing shade and fruit for nourishment. We can replace more of the traditional <em>Deraa's </em>shaded meeting places and begin our work to reform areas of forest which have been depleted by war.  </p>
<p>In exchange we have made efforts to make our gift packages more generous than an average crowdfunding campaign. We've done this because we hope you'll come back and support us again one day and also because we'd like you to be champions of this work to others in your own community.  </p>
<p>Our award-winning designer Johnny Selman based at Google's Creative Lab in New York designed our gift products and they are really stunning. We've designed our gifts around the principles of community and sharing. We want you to have fun flying our kites together and sharing cups of tea in our beautiful chai cups! </p>
<p>In an age when we are all aware of our carbon footprint, even if we don't do much to manage it, a donation to the Afghan Tree Project provides a multi-impact carbon offset option.

<p> The need is great, and yet our current funding situation does not permit us to explore options for growth.  We have spent years developing a successful working model for developing our projects, and these projects  are easily replicated elsewhere in the country.  We will use the funds from this campaign to develop and expand our projects.  We will do this in the following manner:</p>
<p>Plant larger quantities of seeds so that these seeds will then germinate and yield in greater number of tree saplings. The surplus saplings will be shared with communities in neighboring provinces.</p>
<p>The tree planting will mean the employment of additional nursery workers providing work, contributing to the economy and forming a workforce skilled in nurturing trees for the future. </p>

In 1983, Dr. Mariam Raqib left Afghanistan as a child refugee. When she returned for the first time in 2003 she found her country devastated by war. The trees that she loved and had once played happily under had been wiped out.
Determined to make a difference she set out to replace the trees lost by war. For the past 4 years she has perfected the skills and established nurseries required to produce high quality saplings in increasingly large numbers. Now these skills and knowledge are ready to take a big investment and expand the project to other provinces of Afghanistan and a wide-scale reforesation effort.  
The Afghan Tree Project is a powerful and practical opportunity for everyone to help leave Afghanistan a better place, improving the environment, creating jobs and empowering women.  To do this we need your help. 
What We Need & What You Get
We need the funds to expand our nurseries which are the engine of the reforestation effort. By expanding the numbers of saplings produced we can provide fruit trees to individual families providing shade and fruit for nourishment. We can replace more of the traditional Deraa's shaded meeting places and begin our work to reform areas of forest which have been depleted by war.  
In exchange we have made efforts to make our gift packages more generous than an average crowdfunding campaign. We've done this because we hope you'll come back and support us again one day and also because we'd like you to be champions of this work to others in your own community.  
Our award-winning designer Johnny Selman based at Google's Creative Lab in New York designed our gift products and they are really stunning. We've designed our gifts around the principles of community and sharing. We want you to have fun flying our kites together and sharing cups of tea in our beautiful chai cups! 
In an age when we are all aware of our carbon footprint, even if we don't do much to manage it, a donation to the Afghan Tree Project provides a multi-impact carbon offset option. The trees not only reduce carbon but make a huge impact to the Afghan people, providing shade, nourishment and employment in a fragile economy.   If this is your motivation we've produced some carefully designed home and car window stickers which will let people know you care about carbon. 
We guarantee that no tree is double counted and the number of trees that you donate towards are the minimum that are planted on your behalf. If we do better we'll let you know that too.  
At the higher levels we are producing hard back coffee table books and personalised products by Afghan craftsmen and women.  Everyone receives a wall certficiate and stickers for your fridge, wall or bike.  
The Impact
Our work has great potential for the well-being of the country and the people.  We receive requests regularly from other communities in the neighboring provinces who know about our work and wish to collaborate with us.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is <span class=""il"">Grace</span> Sowaske and I am 18 years old. I am a current freshman at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I haven't decided on a major yet but its definitely between Biology and Environmental studies. I am from Madison, Wisconsin and have never left the country. I come from a low income family, but that hasn't stopped me from achieving one of my life goals; being accepted into the University of Wisconsin- Madison. I cant stand to be cooped up for much longer! That is why I found this awesome volunteer opportunity in the Mecca of biodiversity; Australia. It has always been my dream to explore the wildlife in Australia- particularly the marine life. The Great Barrier Reef has always brought wonders to me and it being one of the 7 natural wonders of the world, I feel its worth the effort to try and conserve. My contributors will help me achieve my dream and help me explore a career in conservation biology.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My program costs include my accommodations, most meals, project materials and support, ground transportation, and tour guidance in Australia. These costs will directly help me gain more knowledge and help with conservation efforts. You are making a direct contribution to my education and for conservation. The initial program cost is about $5,500 not including overseas airfare which is approximately an additional $2,000. I have saved about $1,500 on my own, but I need your help! If my goal is not reached, the money will go to ISV, a program that is an internationally recognized and awarded non-profit organization that appoints university students from the U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K. to various countries around the world in an effort to impact entire communities and endangered habitats in need. So the funds will go to a good cause.</p>
<p>However, with the help of my Mom, we are able to add some perks. Look below to see what wonderful treats you can get just for helping me out.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I want to be able to make a difference concerning the depletion of many natural ecosystems around the world and this program accomplishes that along with a better understanding of how I can achieve this goal. I see the oceans as the most beautiful part of our world and I am passionate to get involved in the efforts to conserve such natural beauty and this trip will help me expand my knowledge on how to do so, and will provide me with such rich conservation experience. This project is valuable because of the growing need for a conservation movement. If I can achieve this goal, I will be an addition to this movement and I will be helping the world. In turn, with your donation, you will be helping the conservation movement as well. Your contributions will allow me help conserve the natural world that is steadily becoming less and less a part of our world today.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cant contribute a donation today there are other ways you can help. Spread the word! If not spreading the word of my specific campaign, spread the word of conservation! There is a greater and greater need everyday for conservation of natural things on this planet and your word can help. Simply sharing my campaign with others by using the Indiegogo sharing tools will help! The word needs to be spread, and you can make that happen.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have been building our infrastructure for the last 6 months. We have just finished our first superadobe dome, so we can soon move out of the tents and into our little dome house. With the rainy season in full effect now is a good time to get young fruit trees in the ground. Money is low, but our energies are high. </p>
<p>The arborescent metaphor is so good it's almost cliche. But it's true. To plant a tree, for it to put roots deep into the earth and then for us to have a symboitic relationship of nurture and cohabitation is a powerful symbol of what we are trying to do with New Ruins.</p>
<p>We hope you can be a part of that same relationship.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't want or can't donate money, but still want to help out, there are so many things you can do. Come hang out with us and plant them. Or if you are not able to come and help physically, we are always in need of help from afar and constantly on the look out for like minded thinkers, artists, writers, builders, designers and many more. </p>

<div id=""watch-description-text"">
<p id=""eow-description"">Russian military and space research company Radiy has developed a revolutionary water purification system that is based on nano technology allowing to extract arsenics, metals and salt also and especially from artesian wells and keeping it fresh for up to 180 days without adding chemicals such as chlorine. Anti-bacterial agents make it a primary health supplement. The technology developed by Radiy is 40% more energy efficient than other reverse osmosis systems while the output is 50% higher. The Russian government actively supports the project as it grants access to clean, anti-bacterial, healthy water at affordable costs to all classes of society. The technology can also filter radioactive substances and therefore could be used in Japan. In Haiti a humanitarian project is under way to to install 300 machines in hospitals to help prevent cholera from spreading.</p>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>
<p>once the technology is installed we can clear the contaminated waters in Japan, Haiti, Argentina, South Africa and whereever water is polluted. Governments are too slow to act and that's why we have to prove concept to these institutions by installing prototypes in the various region. Failing to reach our goal means to give up and let millions of people become subject to dreadful levels of contamination, in case of Japan even radioactive pollution.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>One machine clearing 2000 cubic metres of heavily contaminated water per day costs 100,000 US Dollars. We need to send three proto-types to Haiti, Japan and South Africa in order to prove that we can effectively and economically efficiently fight against cholera and other diseases in poor countries, eliminate radioactive substances from water as well as clear Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) waters in South Africa, Argentina and many other countries. Governments will implement this technology as water autnonomy means energy autonomy which is a pre-requirement for a socially balanced society that lives in harmony with the environment. After all, this is about true democracy, human rights and saving the planet of the millenium, Earth.<br/></p>
