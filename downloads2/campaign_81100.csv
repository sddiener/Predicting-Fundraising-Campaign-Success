</div></div>","THE NEWEST AND THE FIRST
Dear friends and extended family of fellow travelers, you with whom I have shared the blessing of music over these many years. I have often been the beneficiary of your kindness and encouragement, silent and loud, to follow my art in new directions. I have been working on a collection of new songs, ""Makin' the  Two One"". These songs were born in the last 4 or 5 years, but are the harvest of  many.  At the same time we are preparing to remix, remaster and re-release my first recording You Gotta Believe.  And at this point, I am at the exciting stage when I can invite you in as fellow producers.
THE NEWEST: MAKIN’ THE TWO ONE
I have lived longer with these songs before recording, than any other of my projects.  And because I have sung them over and over, I've finally got these new songs deep in my bones and feel ready to record and share their melodies and messages with those who need them.  Among the lyrics are these:
Making’ the Two One, in response to gun violence in our world.
 ""Mama sing your lullaby to little men with big guns,
 Seems the world has all gone crazy and the fightin's just begun. 
 Papa help them to remember how to swallow the sun.  
 Illuminate the inner man and make the two one.""
 Divide and Conquer, a recognition that: 
 ""We’re all in this together, there is no us and them...""
My Longtime Valentine 
""Oh my love we walk a windy way, with no guarantee or pay..."" 
 But the moon at night 'til first morning light, and the long  burning sun of our days"" 
Holy Ground
""Will we bend and bow, lay our burdens down
 Kiss the holy ground that we stand on?""

THE FIRST: YOU GOTTA BELIEVE
At the same time, I am re-releasing my first LP You Gotta Believe, recorded in Ames Iowa in 1979, 37 years ago.  I have been encouraged by Matt Michael, younger brother of Jon Michael, who assisted with the original engineering, to revisit this first effort at recording my original songs. We are having the old 16 track 2-inch tapes transferred to digital format and will remix, remaster, and re-release. 
WHERE YOU PLAY A BIG PART
From the very beginning, I have been the beneficiary of the support of friends,family and also complete strangers.  My songs have been born of this support.  The idea that I was a songwriter that others might want to listen to was planted and well nourished by our old friend world reknown photographer, Harold Feinstein.  Harold passed away last year at the age of 84 leaving us an incredible legacy of the beauty of life seeen through his eyes.   It is in his honor that I am dedicating this re-release. 
Harold and I met one late spring night, as I was singing on 6th Avenue in the Village in front of the old Crazy Eddies electronic store.  I had my guitar case open and was singing my heart out to a small gathering of folks.  Harold had come down to buy his evening New York Times.  He stood there at the edge of that street circle transfixed, eyes welling with tears.  Afterwards he introduced himself and asked about the songs I was singing.  He went on to encourage me to dedicate myself to my writing and even giving  me 1/2 the proceeds of every photo he sold to give me more time to write.  In those next two months I wrote the songs that are You Gotta Believe.
The following autumn, I visited my old stomping grounds in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. I ran into an old friend, and fan of the bands I had sung with there, Ed Cannon, one night in a bar.  He asked if I had made my own recording yet, and when I replied no not yet, he asked “ How much would it take?”  Off the top of my head I gave him what I thought to be what it might cost, and really I had no idea. Ed replied ""OK. I'll do it.""   At the time I really didn’t take him seriously.  You know a guy in a bar…When I returned to New York, I mentioned to Harold what Ed had offered and that I thought that was a nice gesture, but didn’t take it seriously.  Harold told me I was crazy and said to immediately call and take him up on his offer, and I did.  
Ed and Harold were the midwives, and with the help and support of many, You Gotta Believe was born in the summer of 1979. Harold made the journey from NYC to take the photo cover and to attend and support the live recording, along with Ed, our benefactor, many friends, and my parents who were still alive. 

All along the way, just when I thought the fire would go out, someone would step in and encourage me, inspire me, cajole me to rekindle the flame.  One of those people has been my musical partner and friend Bill Lauf.  Bill has been the biggest and most consistent fan of my music.  He unfailingly remembers the lyrics to my own songs when I forget them, creates parodies of them, and genuinely seems to think that these songs are worthy efforts.  I have asked him to help me coproduce this next project.  Here is a message from Bill:
""I first heard, OK felt, Susan Osborn sing in a small church in Litchfield CT in 1979, her gospel-ly voice soaring about the cello, piano, hand percussion and soprano sax of the Paul Winter Consort.  For this folky tenor guitar player, it was a transformative  moment in my life.  Her presence,  spirit and vocal pyrotechnics held the audience spellbound. The stone walls helped to keep the place from falling down.  
Later that evening at a friend’s home in the woods, who should waltz through the door, but Susan with guitar in hand. The spirit singer was in the house.  After a handful of hours and one long song circle, our friendship kindled and has continued to this day.
Susan Osborn, who grew up on the prairie in southern Minnesota, is most noted for those powerful pipes of hers, a voice that one feels as well as hears.  Her songwriting skills are just as prodigious as her voice (no small feat) and nowhere is that more apparent than in the new collection entitled Makin’ the Two One she has penned over that past several years.
I have been blessed to hear these gems as they were birthed and bloomed. A Skype connection was the conduit as she player early versions of her new creations from her home in the San Juan Islands of NW Washington State.  Songs about the human spirit, about the need for compassion, the desire for wisdom and hope for all humankind to wrest love from fear.  These are most timely songs to confront the erosion of goodness and love.
Now here is where you come in.  You are the key to putting these songs to work on this fragile earth.  Please donate to what will be her most poignant and human plea for love and peace, compassion and caring.”  
Bill Lauf Jr, tenor guitarist and songwriter.
So I am releasing two projects at the same time that are bookends to my life as a musician so far.  I am proceeding in faith that we will get the job done with your support and prayers, and be able to deliver, as Pablo Neruda declared as the goal of all artists, in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, ” Toward the Splendid City"", a good nourishing loaf of bread to sustain the soul in these perilous times.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<b>Hi Everyone!<br/></b><div>
<b><br/>I am a singer/songwriter with a 
life long passion for music.  After having recorded my first CD at 12 
years old, It became clear it was going to be serious.  First I started 
vocal training  in Spain  to become a soprano,
then went to Conservatory in  Finland  and continued to perform through 
parts of Europe.  
</b><p>
</p>
<div>
<b>Now with a new focus on original 
compositions, the real satisfaction of expression through art has 
brought a new level of energy.   The adventure of producing videos to 
accompany original songs has been difficult, but
rewarding.  I am looking forward to doing more with your support!

</p>

I am a singer/songwriter with a 
life long passion for music.  After having recorded my first CD at 12 
years old, It became clear it was going to be serious.  First I started 
vocal training  in Spain  to become a soprano,
then went to Conservatory in  Finland  and continued to perform through 
parts of Europe.  



Now with a new focus on original 
compositions, the real satisfaction of expression through art has 
brought a new level of energy.   The adventure of producing videos to 
accompany original songs has been difficult, but
rewarding.  I am looking forward to doing more with your support!



“I only hope you enjoy my songs as much as I enjoy making them”



Thank you- in advance,



Freya

<p>There are music websites and streaming
available everywhere on the internet, but none that focus on the up and coming
talent. That’s where we come in. We are artists and music producers ourselves
that have created an online music community designed for artists to collaborate
and ""Grade"" each others work. beatGrade.com is a website where artists will go to get honest feedback for
their art.</p>
<h3>
<b><br/></b><b>The Difference </b>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The difference between beatGrade.com and other music websites, is that we are a social network that encourages users to give and receive feedback. Members can join discussions on a particular beat or track, collaborate, network and stay connected to a hub of other talent. This is a site where users pay close attention to the music that speaks to their ear and gives emerging artists a platform to grow.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<p>We have already put our own resources into
beatGrade.com, as far as the basic needs such as a domain name and web hosting,
building the website, hours of learning code, and hiring programmers to write codes
and more. With your help we can take the website to the next level. A majority
of the funding will go to building an app, advertising, and marketing as well as hiring
professional coders. </p>
<p>Our website has a lot of features that need to
be improved, for example, as we are starting to grow and get more advance, are
traffic is increasing and the website can only handle so much traffic.
Eventually we will need to get our own server which will be an expense as well
as the coder to make sure the site can run smoother and doesn't have down time
when loading. We want the user experience to be as simple as possible. Our site
is <b>Free</b> to any one who wants to become a member.</p>
<p>The budget will also go to attracting traffic and advertisers to keep
the website running, while artists are able to display their creativity to the
masses. What we need from you is a contribution to improve this website and make our features available on a downloadable app platform for mobile users. </p>
<p><i>Anything helps, even if we don’t hit our goal, the funding will still go to the necessary needs for getting our website to a higher standard.</i></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Mobile App for iTunes</h3>
<div>
<p>A main feature that we need help with is to build a native App on the iTunes
store. In order to do this Apple requires you to build a native App (which
basically means a mobile site). </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>                                    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449124371/fouysrwenx7vlknqdhr3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/>
<p>An App on the iTunes store format will generate
a higher use for the website, and build more traffic at a user friendly rate.
Studies show that most people are on mobile devices now instead of desktops. So
for beatGrade.com to become a go to music website, we need to have an App that
can compete at a high level. Luckily our website is already mobile ready, but
to be able to enter into the Apple market we will have to build a customize
native mobile site, which is basically building a new site from scratch, which will
take hours of programming. The jobs listed to be completed are just the basic
needs to get us up to operational standards. There of course are other
items needed in the budget for media equipment, renting studios for interviews,
crew cost, and merchandise.</p>

business. This video posted on Facebook, which got over 2 million hits in 1

There are music websites and streaming
available everywhere on the internet, but none that focus on the up and coming
talent. That’s where we come in. We are artists and music producers ourselves
that have created an online music community designed for artists to collaborate
and ""Grade"" each others work. beatGrade.com is a website where artists will go to get honest feedback for
their art.

The Difference 


The difference between beatGrade.com and other music websites, is that we are a social network that encourages users to give and receive feedback. Members can join discussions on a particular beat or track, collaborate, network and stay connected to a hub of other talent. This is a site where users pay close attention to the music that speaks to their ear and gives emerging artists a platform to grow.


                  




What We Need 



We have already put our own resources into
beatGrade.com, as far as the basic needs such as a domain name and web hosting,
building the website, hours of learning code, and hiring programmers to write codes
and more. With your help we can take the website to the next level. A majority
of the funding will go to building an app, advertising, and marketing as well as hiring
professional coders. 
Our website has a lot of features that need to
be improved, for example, as we are starting to grow and get more advance, are
traffic is increasing and the website can only handle so much traffic.
Eventually we will need to get our own server which will be an expense as well
as the coder to make sure the site can run smoother and doesn't have down time
when loading. We want the user experience to be as simple as possible. Our site
is Free to any one who wants to become a member.
The budget will also go to attracting traffic and advertisers to keep
the website running, while artists are able to display their creativity to the
masses. What we need from you is a contribution to improve this website and make our features available on a downloadable app platform for mobile users. 
Anything helps, even if we don’t hit our goal, the funding will still go to the necessary needs for getting our website to a higher standard.

Mobile App for iTunes

A main feature that we need help with is to build a native App on the iTunes
store. In order to do this Apple requires you to build a native App (which
basically means a mobile site). 


                                    



An App on the iTunes store format will generate
a higher use for the website, and build more traffic at a user friendly rate.
Studies show that most people are on mobile devices now instead of desktops. So
for beatGrade.com to become a go to music website, we need to have an App that
can compete at a high level. Luckily our website is already mobile ready, but
to be able to enter into the Apple market we will have to build a customize
native mobile site, which is basically building a new site from scratch, which will
take hours of programming. The jobs listed to be completed are just the basic
needs to get us up to operational standards. There of course are other
items needed in the budget for media equipment, renting studios for interviews,
crew cost, and merchandise.


Audio Player


A main feature that will need to be updated is our media player. Currently
it looks like this







Our goal
is to have it look something like this, with a thumbnail image



Even

asked coders what it will take to have a custom audio player close to this design, and have been told that it would take hours of coding at an expensive rate. They will also need to
apply this method to our video player as well which is another job that will

Increased artists activity, member suggestions, and employees we eventually hire will also be heard, and will also end up as a featured artists.

<li>My name is Andrew Boyce, and I have been a professional musician and music teacher for many years. The Wendell Project has come about from an experience I had watching my father slowly decline over a ten year period and eventually pass away do to early onset Alzheimer's Disease. One Christmas we went to visit him at his care facility and it was at the point that he could no longer remember our names, or who we were. He could not speak in full sentences. All he knew at this point was we were friendly, and he smiled back at us. We gathered around him and started to sing Christmas carols, and suddenly  he lit up and started singing with us. It was an amazing moment. We finally had a connection back to him. He could not remember our names, or who we were, but could remember the lyrics to these old songs. It meant a lot to our whole family that at this point we could do something to make him happy, that he could enjoy. I have since learned a lot about music therapy, and the mental and emotional benefits that can be gained from musical experiences for those with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. </li> <li>I have composed 8 original songs that I have written specifically with the goal of being relaxing and peaceful. These songs have been influenced strongly from my background in jazz, as well as my love of pop music, blues, gospel, and folk music. </li> <li>It is my goal first to record and promote this project as step one, then to schedule performances at nursing facilities as the end goal. I went with the crowd funding model with the hope that I could be self sufficiant and not have to charge the nursing facilities for my services. This would allow me to be able to go into the facilities that would not be able to afford such a service, but might  really be in need of such a program.</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Your financial support will go towards:</p> <ul> <li>The recording of 8 original compositions. This is a suite of music I composed for primarily therapeutic purposes. The music is meant to be relaxing but engaging, with the end goal to perform these at assisted living centers.</li>
<li>mastering the recording</li>
<li>cover design</li>
<li>CD printing</li>
<li>Liner Notes</li>
<li>Promotion</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This is directed towards a segment of society that I feel unfortunately too often gets ignored. I hope thorough this project to bring these people some joy, and give them something calming to listen to, as well as stimulate the parts of the brain having to do with memory to help them interact with staff and their families in a healthy way.</p> <ul> <li>I see this project as my way to pay the world/ karma / Society back for giving me the opportunity to study, perform, and be involved in music, and to have a positive impact on the world.</li>
<li>Down the road, I see this as potentially growing into a nonprofit organization, and hiring other musicians for performances as well. </li>

I went with the crowd funding model with the hope that I could be self sufficiant and not have to charge the nursing facilities for my services. This would allow me to be able to go into the facilities that would not be able to afford such a service, but might  really be in need of such a program.
   What We Need & What You Get Your financial support will go towards:  The recording of 8 original compositions. This is a suite of music I composed for primarily therapeutic purposes. The music is meant to be relaxing but engaging, with the end goal to perform these at assisted living centers.

Liner Notes
Promotion    The Impact This is directed towards a segment of society that I feel unfortunately too often gets ignored. I hope thorough this project to bring these people some joy, and give them something calming to listen to, as well as stimulate the parts of the brain having to do with memory to help them interact with staff and their families in a healthy way.  I see this project as my way to pay the world/ karma / Society back for giving me the opportunity to study, perform, and be involved in music, and to have a positive impact on the world.
Down the road, I see this as potentially growing into a nonprofit organization, and hiring other musicians for performances as well. 
$1 from the sale of each CD will go towards Alzheimer's disease research.     Risks & Challenges 
This is a large project, but one I am very passionate about. It will require a high level of dedication though the various stages of execution, but I believe is very attainable with a little financial support.    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  If you are unable to contribute financially, but think this is a good idea, please share this campaign with friends and colleagues through social media and/or e-mail. Send good vibes/ pray if you do/ wish  for the success of this project and that it is successful in helping people.   And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Hello! My name is Kristy Marie of Kristy Marie and the forget me nots, from Duluth MN.  I have been making and writing music for the past 12 years. The last Album I made was with the band Bird By Bird which came out in 2011, it was a collaboration of original music, from a few different song writers (waabi Furo and Emily Heart) as well as myself.  I love how music brings people together and alchamizes trials and tribulations into inspiration . together we are more.  I also write contemporary melodies to ancient chants from around the world. I use these chants to Lead Kirtan and  Zikr, musical meditations that are experiential and dedicated for the benefit of all sentient beings. </span><br/></p>
<p>This new project is of its own flavor, an evolution of persona and determinant message. It is hard to pinpoint genre wise,  but is some kind of ethereal folk music with a story to tell. Unlike the bird by bird Album, this is all my own songs, with a collaborative twist. every person involved ended up co-writing their own part. I am very proud of this Album. This Album came through like a kick in the pants from the Gods~ it has been something that we have not only been working on, but its been working on us.  It challenged my soul and life purpose.  The message became refined over time. and it began to show us why it needed to be birthed. it has changed my life. And helped me understand the power of Love and hard work, and how the infinitely mysterious Great Mystery continuously unveils to us meaning in all things. I enjoy what we have made, I think you will too. </p>
<p>I believe that the message in this Album is very pertinent to our time, yet that it has an aspect within it that will never die and always be relevant.  </p>
<p>Like all Art, it costs money to create! Your generous contributions will make it possible for us to have an amazing mastering ear contributing to the completion of the sound. It will also help us print the physical CD that can be held in the hand. Having the CD in the hand is a big part of the Art. not that you should judge a book by its cover, not at all... but a good cover also helps round out, make tangible the message, although perhaps in a more subliminal way. We also look forward to having a website to having a place people can go to find the music and the happenings. So Thank You!! for not only your monetary contribution, but also for your attention. This Album is well on its way to being in the world, I'm excited to invite you to be a part of the process! it's really happening:) Thanks for your attention and for your support. </p>

<p><b>About 16volt</b></p>
<p>With it's roots planted firmly in the industrial rock/metal genre, 16volt remains a mainstay through the course of 20+ years growing it's worldwide fan base crossing over into multiple genres despite their longevity and sorted history.</p>
<p>16volt's founder, lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Eric Powell signed his first record deal in 1991 for 16volt with the indie label Re-Constriction / Cargo Records where he delivered three albums; ""Wisdom"" (1993), ""Skin"" (1994), and ""LetDownCrush"" (1996). Working with co-producers; David Ogilvie (Nine Inch Nails), Keith “Fluffy” Auerbach (Ministry), Jeff ""Critter"" Newell (Angels &amp; Airwaves, Blink-182) and special guests William Tucker (Ministry), Marc LaCorte (Schecter Guitars), and Bryan Black (Motor). The three albums earned worldwide praise and caught features in Guitar Player, Alternative Press, B-Side, Kerrang!, CMJ, Industrial Nation, B-Side, and more. Reaching a #1 slot on Rolling Stone’s alternative charts (LetDownCrush) as well as a #2 slot on Rolling Stone’s alternative charts (Skin), the band made a huge mark in the Industrial scene as they consistently charted in both college and national radio.</p>
<p>16volt’s national touring career was born during these years making their way around the United States several times with the likes of Korn, Chemlab, Bile, Acumen Nation, as well as multiple successful headlining tours. 16volt made a shift into the rock genre signing with Mercury/PolyGram and brought on producer Bill Kennedy (NIN, Megadeth, Sepultura, Motley Crue) to make the highly recognized album ""SuperCoolNothing"". Featuring guests Joseph Bishara (Drown, Danzig), Chris Vrenna (NIN, Tweaker), Mike Peoples (Skrew), and Kraig Tyler (Crazytown), SCN was the band’s most aggressive album to date.</p>
<p>16volt provided the soundtrack to the PlayStation game “Primal”. The game made it possible for 16volt to release the ""SuperCoolNothing"" album both in-game and as it's own independent release. To celebrate the release of “Primal,” and the re-birth of ""SuperCoolNothing"", 16volt hit the road with KMFDM for a sold-out North American tour. Upon returning from the road 16volt inked a new deal with Capitol Records.</p>
<p>16volt released “FullBlackHabit” (2007), ""American Porn Songs"" (2009), and ""Beating Dead Horses"" (2012) through Metropolis Records to a hungry fan base. With guests such as Paul Raven (Ministry, Killing Joke, Prong); Steve White (KMFDM); Bildeaux (Lance Herbstrong) and mix engineers such as Shaun Thingvold (Strapping Young Lad, Lamb of God) adding to the magic. </p><p></p><p></p></div>","We Are Back and Need Your Help!

16volt provided the soundtrack to the PlayStation game “Primal”. The game made it possible for 16volt to release the ""SuperCoolNothing"" album both in-game and as it's own independent release. To celebrate the release of “Primal,” and the re-birth of ""SuperCoolNothing"", 16volt hit the road with KMFDM for a sold-out North American tour. Upon returning from the road 16volt inked a new deal with Capitol Records.
16volt released “FullBlackHabit” (2007), ""American Porn Songs"" (2009), and ""Beating Dead Horses"" (2012) through Metropolis Records to a hungry fan base. With guests such as Paul Raven (Ministry, Killing Joke, Prong); Steve White (KMFDM); Bildeaux (Lance Herbstrong) and mix engineers such as Shaun Thingvold (Strapping Young Lad, Lamb of God) adding to the magic.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Phil Lawrence and I've been a professional musician since 1975. I started playing mandolin in 1978. In 1980 I recorded my first project which at that time was released as a cassette. Since then I have produced or participated in over twenty recording projects with my own bands or with others. I've had the honor of performing and recording with some of the best musicians in the San Francisco area, including David Grisman (The Grateful Dead, Garcia /Grisman, The David Grisman Quintet) and David LaFlamme (It's A Beautiful Day). A full account of my history and recording projects can be found on my website at: <a href=""http://phillawrence.com/home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://phillawrence.com/home.html</a></p>
<p>Before the pandemic, and even further back, before the advent of sharing music files on the internet, it used to be possible to invest in a recording project and be reasonably assured of opportunities to recoup the cost of the project by direct sales to audiences. This direct approach has become exceedingly difficult in the new music market.</p>
<p>I have been working on a new CD project called Mandolin Swing that includes sixteen jazz standards and one original—all acoustic instrumental pieces mainly from the Django Reinhardt Gypsy jazz repertoire. It features my mandolin and guitar playing. I've received musical contributions from my friends on rhythm guitar, bass, and violin. The recording process began in March at the beginning of the pandemic and was completed a few weeks ago in February 2021. The next steps involve obtaining the artwork, uploading the design of the cover and the music, and finalizing the order so that the music can be made available on CD and on digital download and streaming platforms.</p>
<p>If you decide to contribute to this project you will be helping me overcome the obstacles of the new music marketing system which prohibits musicians from earning a reasonable return on their financial investment in recording; you would be allowing me to release a high quality instrumental work of art for public enjoyment; and you could receive a copy of the music yourself or more depending on the level of your contribution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What I Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of what it has cost so far to record these seventeen tunes.</p>
<p>Most bands or solo artists would have to spend at least seven thousand dollars in a recording studio to cover the amount of time I have spent on recording in my home studio. The good news–I did all the recording, mixing, and editing myself, so there is no cost involved there. This project has taken me a whole year and the seven thousand dollar estimate is probably well below the actual cost. But we can skip this expense. It's already covered.</p>
<p>Mastering the recording—this is something I could not do myself. I have had the music mastered at Studio E in Sebastopol for $400. Mastering assures that the final audio quality is even and flawless, so it's a necessary step that could not be avoided. Studio E has balanced all the levels, equalized the instruments where necessary, eliminated accidental sounds, and included data on each track.</p>
<p>Musician pay-- Three musicians have contributed their services to this project. They have generously asked for very little payment and I'm grateful for their participation. I have tried to play as many of the parts myself by overdubbing the guitars, mandolins, and even a tenor banjo on one song. Nevertheless, the musicians received approximately $400 in pay—far too little—and if your contributions exceed the desired goal I've set I will add to the amount they have already received.</p>
<p>Artwork—I have paid a young artist $200 for the cover art. It's a beautiful original color drawing depicting a mandolin on a swing under a tree.</p>
<p>Copyright—These are all cover tunes. My previous CD projects were almost all entirely original music. When an artist records a work by another artist, the rights must be purchased. The rights to use sixteen cover tunes amounted to almost $400.</p>
<p>Manufacturing and online distribution—Printing the actual CDs and making them available online for download and streaming services will cost about $360 for one hundred physical copies with color covers and inserts.</p>
<p>This brings the total cost of the project to about $1,760. That's an incredibly small amount for a musical project of this size and quality. Most bands would spend at least $20,000 on a full length CD. As a result, I'm setting my goal at $1,800.</p>
<p>If I don't reach this goal I will use whatever has been contributed so far to defray my personal expenses and I will complete the project out of my own pocket, so that contributors will be sure to receive the rewards I have promised no matter where the final tally stands.</p>
<p>Now the “perks,” as Indiegogo calls them. Your rewards for helping me out include music I've created for this CD project and, depending on what level you donate, music from my previous CD projects as well. I've broken down the levels of contribution into about twenty categories so you can choose to donate as little as $5.00 or as much as $1000 if you want.</p>
<div>
<p>I guarantee you will like every minute of this beautiful recording of Django Reinhardt music plus some other tunes that you will recognize as well as one of my own originals. It contains quite a few lively tunes, along with moderate tempos and jazz ballads. The mandolin lends itself to this style of music--it can be used as a driving rhythmic instrument or as a lead melody instrument. Many of the tunes I've recorded use twin mandolins in two-part harmony and sometimes even three part harmonies with my lead guitar doubling the melodies and adding some occasional fills between the lines. My friend, Eddie Guthman, plays a two-hundred year old upright bass; Rick Fulkerson added his powerful Django-style rhythm guitar to seven tracks; and David Boyden plays violin on two tracks. The combination of all the instruments creates a full, luscious sound.</p>
<p>This is not the first recording I've made, as you can see by the perks I'm offering. In the past I have been joined on my recordings by David Grisman, the foremost mandolin player in our lifetime who has performed with The Grateful Dead, Jerry Garcia, Stephan Grappelli, Tommy Emmanuel, Chris Thile, and many more; David LaFlamme from It's A Beautiful Day and I collaborated on my Mandolin Heaven CD from 2016; Radim Zenkl, a virtuoso player from the Czech Republic accompanied me on my Mandolin Mezzotints CD. All of my earlier recordings can be heard online if you want to hear more and learn more. Please visit my website at <a href=""http://phillawrence.com/home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://phillawrence.com/home.html</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a list of the perks you can receive:</p>

<p>For $5.00 you will receive two digital downloads of solo tracks from the new CD. Your choice of tunes.</p>
<p>For $10 you will receive a digital download of the Mandolin Swing recordings—all seventeen tunes.</p>

This project has taken me a whole year and the seven thousand dollar estimate is probably well below the actual cost. But we can skip this expense. It's already covered.
Mastering the recording—this is something I could not do myself. I have had the music mastered at Studio E in Sebastopol for $400. Mastering assures that the final audio quality is even and flawless, so it's a necessary step that could not be avoided. Studio E has balanced all the levels, equalized the instruments where necessary, eliminated accidental sounds, and included data on each track.
Musician pay-- Three musicians have contributed their services to this project. They have generously asked for very little payment and I'm grateful for their participation. I have tried to play as many of the parts myself by overdubbing the guitars, mandolins, and even a tenor banjo on one song. Nevertheless, the musicians received approximately $400 in pay—far too little—and if your contributions exceed the desired goal I've set I will add to the amount they have already received.
Artwork—I have paid a young artist $200 for the cover art. It's a beautiful original color drawing depicting a mandolin on a swing under a tree.
Copyright—These are all cover tunes. My previous CD projects were almost all entirely original music. When an artist records a work by another artist, the rights must be purchased. The rights to use sixteen cover tunes amounted to almost $400.
Manufacturing and online distribution—Printing the actual CDs and making them available online for download and streaming services will cost about $360 for one hundred physical copies with color covers and inserts.
This brings the total cost of the project to about $1,760. That's an incredibly small amount for a musical project of this size and quality. Most bands would spend at least $20,000 on a full length CD. As a result, I'm setting my goal at $1,800.
If I don't reach this goal I will use whatever has been contributed so far to defray my personal expenses and I will complete the project out of my own pocket, so that contributors will be sure to receive the rewards I have promised no matter where the final tally stands.
Now the “perks,” as Indiegogo calls them. Your rewards for helping me out include music I've created for this CD project and, depending on what level you donate, music from my previous CD projects as well. I've broken down the levels of contribution into about twenty categories so you can choose to donate as little as $5.00 or as much as $1000 if you want.

I guarantee you will like every minute of this beautiful recording of Django Reinhardt music plus some other tunes that you will recognize as well as one of my own originals. It contains quite a few lively tunes, along with moderate tempos and jazz ballads. The mandolin lends itself to this style of music--it can be used as a driving rhythmic instrument or as a lead melody instrument. Many of the tunes I've recorded use twin mandolins in two-part harmony and sometimes even three part harmonies with my lead guitar doubling the melodies and adding some occasional fills between the lines. My friend, Eddie Guthman, plays a two-hundred year old upright bass; Rick Fulkerson added his powerful Django-style rhythm guitar to seven tracks; and David Boyden plays violin on two tracks. The combination of all the instruments creates a full, luscious sound.
This is not the first recording I've made, as you can see by the perks I'm offering. In the past I have been joined on my recordings by David Grisman, the foremost mandolin player in our lifetime who has performed with The Grateful Dead, Jerry Garcia, Stephan Grappelli, Tommy Emmanuel, Chris Thile, and many more; David LaFlamme from It's A Beautiful Day and I collaborated on my Mandolin Heaven CD from 2016; Radim Zenkl, a virtuoso player from the Czech Republic accompanied me on my Mandolin Mezzotints CD. All of my earlier recordings can be heard online if you want to hear more and learn more. Please visit my website at http://phillawrence.com/home.html.

<h3>Tyler Marsh Recording Project</h3>
<p>For those of you who do not know me, my name is Tyler Marsh.  I have performed musically at numerous venues and churches in my hometown and across several southern states. Over the course of my life I have written between 400-500 songs of which about 20 are actually worth listening to, kind of true kind of untrue. However, I have only recorded a small portion of those songs and some were recorded without guidance or direction, so...   </p>
<p>I want to eliminate the ""What ifs"" in my life, complete a thought, document it, and share it with the world. I want to calm the idea of being some major rock star and tour across the country and simply share my thoughts with each of you and to the people the songs were created for and about.  So I'm running this campaign to try and reach the financial goals needed to record 3-4 songs professionally. </p>
<p>There is no denying your support would help me achieve a lifelong dream, take words from paper, chords from a guitar, and thoughts from my head and put them into song format, Creating art that could reach others and just maybe help someone in need. </p>
<p>​</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm seeking $3000.00 of funding from this campaign. I will recording the song ""Clarity"" that I wrote on the piano, the song ""As You're Finding You"" that I wrote for my daughter, and the song ""Tonight"" that I wrote 9 years ago. The money will go towards studio time, studio musicians, and a producer to work with me as well as help shape my songs. This funding allows me to have assistance from talented musicians and producers from within the industry and who care about my project. All the funding raised from Indiegogo will go directly to the studio. I will support my efforts by paying any extra fees and travel to and from the studio. </p>
<p>What do you get? </p>
<p>Just $2 of support gets you all the newly recorded songs at a discounted price. Digital Download. Delivered on release date. </p>
<p>Just $5 of support gets you early access to all the new recordings. 3 days before the songs are released to everyone.  Advance Digital Download. </p>
<p>Just $8 of support gets you early access to all the new recordings. One week before the songs are released to everyone.  Advance Digital Download. </p>
<p>Just $10 of support gets you early access to all the new recordings. Two weeks before the songs are released to everyone. Advance Digital Download. </p>
<p>I'll come play for your family and friends at your house for $250. </p>
<p>Let's say I don't reach my total goal I will still record at least one song, so all your proceeds will go towards my recording of at least a new song. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I've  always tried to give my all to my songwriting, my guitar playing, my performances. I feel music makes a difference. It's an escape and a way of handling changes in life. I never took that thought lightly. My uncle always told me, ""Every time you take that stage, treat it like its the last time you ever will, because one day it will be."" I've always remembered that before ever starting a set. </p>
<p>The songs I've written and recorded in the past have been songs that made an impact in others lives whether lyrically, musically, or just the thought that can't really be you? </p>
<p>These are songs I've written about changes in my life and for those in my life. These songs will be relatable and shareable sources of inspiration and help during different stages of life. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Basically the main challenge and hurdle I face in achieving this next goal for my music career is just funding. If I had $3000 to spare, I wouldn't even be bothering you right now. To some it doesn't seem like much but to me it seems like a lot. Please help in anyway possible. </p>

The city of New Orleans simply creeps up inside your heart almost without you noticing, and once it’s there, it’s something you simply just can’t shake. New Orleans has been our home away from home for quite some time now and the spiritual pull to record this album here was strong. <strong>Just finished recording at 2 studios in the epicenter of New Orleans.</strong> Esplanade Studios is a beautiful 1920's church located in the heart of the Treme, and has recorded such greats as Dr. John, Bonnie Raitt, Eric Clapton, Willie Nelson, Elvis Costello, John Legend, Daniel Lanois, T-Bone Burnett, Ani Difranco, Amos Lee, The Revivalists, and many more. Neutral Sound is a vintage inspired house studio based on the smaller recording rooms of the 60's, such as the famous ones run by Motown and Sun Records. Both studios allowed us to capture the various sound textures we were chasing after. <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/sarasymsmusic/sets/the-darkest-light-track-teasers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hear some track samples here :)</a><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612821493/gyyiebngvlq2h38oid2g.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>MUSICIANS</strong><br/>Drums: Jamison Ross, Trenton O’Neal, Aaron Boudreaux<br/>Bass: Robin Sherman, TJ Norris<br/>Keys: Rob Kellner, Andriu Yanovski, Sam Fribush<br/>Guitar: Ari Teitel<br/>Clarinet: Nick Ellman<br/>Trumpet: Aurelien Barnes<br/>Trombone: TJ Norris<br/>Pedal Steel: Dave Easley<br/>Cello: Jack Craft<br/>Tuba: Edward Lee </p><p> </p><h3>Meet the team</h3><p><strong>Ari Teitel</strong> (Producer):<br/>Grammy nominated Ari Teitel began his career at 11 years old on stage sitting in with Robert Randolph at the Michigan Theater in his hometown of Detroit.

track teasers on Soundcloud</a></p><p><strong>The Darkest Light</strong><br/>“I dare you, look inside your heart, prepare to, look inside your soul… it’s dark I know, but underneath is light, it’s dark I know, but shadows come and go… in time you’ll find, each time you look inside you will be stronger, you will believe… each soul you meet, will teach you just exactly what you need, when you need it the most”</p><p><strong>Fear and Love</strong><br/>“On the other side of power, on the other side of pain, on the other side of silence, so much more to gain… the darkest part before the dawn, fire from above… on the other side of fear is love”</p><p><strong>Where Do I Belong</strong><br/>“Where do I belong, where is my place, out on a ledge, in this open space, land for you and me, fighting to be free, our hopes and dreams for what we want to be… I lie awake and wonder why, my heart feels the way it does down deep inside, confusion sets in, where shall I begin, am I just another face, trying to find my final place”</p><p><strong>Unknown Road</strong><br/>“Way up North where the wind is cold, where the winter blows, left my heart in the frozen rain… Way down South where the willows grow, where the whistle blows, left my heart in the salty sea… Way out East where the land is old, where the leaves are gold, left my heart in the open sky… Way out West where the desert’s dry, where the coyotes cry, left my heart in the painted plains…I’m here, I’m there, I’m everywhere, not sure which way to go, I’m near, I’m far, my own North Star please save me, onward down the unknown road”</p><p><strong>The Game</strong><br/>“Run, gotta get away, gotta get away, don’t you know there’s a price to pay, lying, cheating, all the world is bleeding, oh the little games we play”</p><p><strong>World We Live In</strong><br/>“I breathe you in, you promise comfort, I let you in… you lie to me without me knowing, everyday I start again… is this the world, is this the world we’re living in, I want to live in a new world my friend”</p><p><strong>River of Life</strong><br/>22 years ago I crossed the water, 22 years ago I left this land… 42 years ago I had a daughter, 42 years ago she took my hand… as I wondered through the days, the nights, the moments, I pondered what would come of her some day… her eyes were wide her spirit filled with fortune… what’s hers, what’s mine, what’s destined here to stay”</p><p><strong>Shadow Hunters</strong><br/>“How can the gifts we’ve been given heal the world, how can the heart extend beyond ourselves… how can the gifts we’ve been given guide the way, when poison has replaced our protection… We are the shadow hunters, the chasers of life, we are the chosen ones, we fight for one and all, the flames of time, when dark divides, our light aligns”</p><p><strong>Good Times Never Last</strong><br/>“God, you’ve been crying for days, you’ve been crying for days, all our friends have gone away… God, we’ve been calling your name, we’ve been calling your name, but still no answer… Why, when they’re up there with you, and not down here with me, have you been so sad… loving you is all we’ve ever known, missing you, we’re out here on our own, wishing we could just start over, reinvent the past, if only for a moment… the good times never last”</p><p><strong>Change in the Air</strong><br/>“There’s a change in the air today, which way holds all the answers, there’s a change in the air today, maybe the answer is just not to know, there’s a change in the air today, today we change in time… lost in our minds we have grown without knowing, finding our way yet the time keeps on showing us love, again and again and again… lost in a dream we have drawn from our scenery, finding a treasure we lost long ago, our love, again and again and again”</p><p> </p><h3>Links and video samples</h3><p>MY SITES:<br/><a href=""http://www.sarasyms.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.sarasyms.com</a><br/><a

The city of New Orleans simply creeps up inside your heart almost without you noticing, and once it’s there, it’s something you simply just can’t shake. New Orleans has been our home away from home for quite some time now and the spiritual pull to record this album here was strong. Just finished recording at 2 studios in the epicenter of New Orleans. Esplanade Studios is a beautiful 1920's church located in the heart of the Treme, and has recorded such greats as Dr. John, Bonnie Raitt, Eric Clapton, Willie Nelson, Elvis Costello, John Legend, Daniel Lanois, T-Bone Burnett, Ani Difranco, Amos Lee, The Revivalists, and many more. Neutral Sound is a vintage inspired house studio based on the smaller recording rooms of the 60's, such as the famous ones run by Motown and Sun Records. Both studios allowed us to capture the various sound textures we were chasing after.

He has toured with Grammy-nominated drummer/vocalist Jamison Ross, swings out with New Orleans Jazz Orchestra, and contributed his sound to Iggy Pop's most recent album, “Free”.Chris Finney (Engineer):Chris is a Grammy-Winning Producer, Engineer, and Mixer.

Fundraising goalOver the years, I have made a HUGE investment in my dream. And at the end of the day, making a record is expensive. More expensive than most would imagine. That paired with costs of rehearsals, recording, musicians, engineering, producing, mixing, mastering, printing, promotion, pr, filming, editing, social marketing and everything else under the sun... it all adds up. I have set the fundraising goal for this album at roughly 25% of my total investment. Each and every contribution helps make my dream a reality while giving you some truly unique and exciting rewards. Whatever you feel like giving, helping out with, sharing the project, tweeting, blogging, tap-dancing, yodeling, river-dancing, anything to help me get word out there about this project! There are no words for how much your generosity means to me.Every little bit helps and your contributions are helping to fund:- Producer, engineers and studio time - Session musicians (guitar, bass, drums, piano, synth, organ, cello, horns and more)- Post-production (editing, mixing, mastering)- Album production (CD & Vinyl pressing)- Distribution, marketing and promotion for the album- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Current Goal: 10KFlex Goal: 15K- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Track listing / Lyric snippetsSample track teasers on SoundcloudThe Darkest Light“I dare you, look inside your heart, prepare to, look inside your soul… it’s dark I know, but underneath is light, it’s dark I know, but shadows come and go… in time you’ll find, each time you look inside you will be stronger, you will believe… each soul you meet, will teach you just exactly what you need, when you need it the most”Fear and Love“On the other side of power, on the other side of pain, on the other side of silence, so much more to gain… the darkest part before the dawn, fire from above… on the other side of fear is love”Where Do I Belong“Where do I belong, where is my place, out on a ledge, in this open space, land for you and me, fighting to be free, our hopes and dreams for what we want to be… I lie awake and wonder why, my heart feels the way it does down deep inside, confusion sets in, where shall I begin, am I just another face, trying to find my final place”Unknown Road“Way up North where the wind is cold, where the winter blows, left my heart in the frozen rain… Way down South where the willows grow, where the whistle blows, left my heart in the salty sea… Way out East where the land is old, where the leaves are gold, left my heart in the open sky… Way out West where the desert’s dry, where the coyotes cry, left my heart in the painted plains…I’m here, I’m there, I’m everywhere, not sure which way to go, I’m near, I’m far, my own North Star please save me, onward down the unknown road”The Game“Run, gotta get away, gotta get away, don’t you know there’s a price to pay, lying, cheating, all the world is bleeding, oh the little games we play”World We Live In“I breathe you in, you promise comfort, I let you in… you lie to me without me knowing, everyday I start again… is this the world, is this the world we’re living in, I want to live in a new world my friend”River of Life22 years ago I crossed the water, 22 years ago I left this land… 42 years ago I had a daughter, 42 years ago she took my hand… as I wondered through the days, the nights, the moments, I pondered what would come of her some day… her eyes were wide her spirit filled with fortune… what’s hers, what’s mine, what’s destined here to stay”Shadow Hunters“How can the gifts we’ve been given heal the world, how can the heart extend beyond ourselves… how can the gifts we’ve been given guide the way, when poison has replaced our protection… We are the shadow hunters, the chasers of life, we are the chosen ones, we fight for one and all, the flames of time, when dark divides, our light aligns”Good Times Never Last“God, you’ve been crying for days, you’ve been crying for days, all our friends have gone away… God, we’ve been calling your name, we’ve been calling your name, but still no answer… Why, when they’re up there with you, and not down here with me, have you been so sad… loving you is all we’ve ever known, missing you, we’re out here on our own, wishing we could just start over, reinvent the past, if only for a moment… the good times never last”Change in the Air“There’s a change in the air today, which way holds all the answers, there’s a change in the air today, maybe the answer is just not to know, there’s a change in the air today, today we change in time… lost in our minds we have grown without knowing, finding our way yet the time keeps on showing us love, again and again and again… lost in a dream we have drawn from our scenery, finding a treasure we lost long ago, our love, again and again and again” Links and video samplesMY SITES:http://www.sarasyms.comhttp://sarasyms.bandcamp.comhttp://www.facebook.com/ssymsmusichttp://www.instagram.com/sarasymsVIDEOS:Crossroads (official music video)Dance on my Grave (live performance video)Real Bad Low (official music video) Thank you beautiful souls.It's a pretty tough and challenging time for most right now.

Your support (<i>both through the years and now</i>) means so much to me, and I look forward to sharing the heart and soul of this experience with you as you join my community!</h3><h3>Read on to learn more about me, this project, and all the amazing people that helped make it a reality....</h3><p> </p><h2><i><u>About Me:</u></i></h2><p>My name is Kevin Graybill, or simply <i>Graybill, </i>and I'm an acoustic Indi-Folk singer/songwriter residing on the Central Coast of California in Shell Beach.  My genre has been described as ""beach-folk"", drawing comparisons to artists like Jack Johnson, G. Love, Michael Franti, and Sam Beam of Iron and Wine.  My songwriting is influenced equally by both my external surroundings and internal musings.  After years spent in both Seattle, WA, and California, my style has evolved and matured into what can best be described as a happy medium between ""sunny optimism"" and ""rainy introspection.""</p><p>Being a self-taught artist that fumbled and stumbled my way through learning how to play guitar in my high school bedroom, I can't say enough how much it means to me to have gotten to this point.  There was once a day where I only dreamed of simply being considered a ""musician.""  After a ton of hard work pursuing my passion over the years,  I'm now a professional musician that plays 100+ shows a year.  Now after battling through the 2020 pandemic, I recorded my debut album that I couldn't be prouder of and excited to share!  Please help me make this a reality!!</p><p> </p><h2><i><u>About This Album:</u></i></h2><h2> </h2><p>The album is 12 total tracks, split into two different 6-track EP’s, “High Tide and Low Tide”.   High Tide being more upbeat and <i>sunny</i>, with a polished full band sound, and Low Tide being more introspective and <i>rainy</i>, with more of a stripped down acoustic vibe.  These contrasts speak to my different styles of playing, but also to the human experience we all have in common; no two days are the same, our internal and collective tides go up, and go down, that’s just life, and it was important to me to honor that with this project...especially in 2020. </p><p>Another part of my artistic vision was to somehow honor the tradition of the ""LP,"" while at the same time speaking to the reality of how music is primarily consumed these days: <i>playlists on streaming platforms.</i>  So though it's a full record worth of music, each EP was designed to be experienced through the lens of different moods.  High Tide is something you might turn on when having a BBQ with friends in the backyard, and Low Tide is more suited for a candlelit bubble bath.  Full track listing can be seen below:</p><p><u><i><strong>High Tide:</strong></i></u></p><ol>

Being a versatile musician, I quickly made a name for myself as a drummer in local rock and jazz groups and I had the opportunity to play with some of the best young local musicians of the time, such as Bernard Égreteau, Olivier Gatto, Erik Baron or Do Harson and groups as varied as the Black Bottom Jazz Band, Mahjong or the blues-rock power-trio Baron Dupoil. Between 1985 and 1986, I was recruited as a percussionist and drummer in the French army band (GMR4 57e R.I.).</p><p>In 1987 I moved to Canada to study jazz at McGill University. There I studied drums with Peter Magadini, André White and Dave Laing, as well as arrangement and composition with Jan Jarczyk. I also counted among my professors musicians Kevin Dean, Gordon Foote, Greg Clayton, Fred Henke, Michel Donato and Benoit Glazer. I attended several workshops and master classes with renowned international musicians, such as Marvin Smith, Ed Thigpen, Peter Erskine, Barry Harris, Steve Lacy or Dave Holland.</p><p>During these formative years, I had the opportunity to share the stage with musicians who would carve out a name for themselves on the Canadian and European jazz scene, notably Mike Allen, Greg Amirault, Joel Miller, Kelly Jefferson, Christine Jensen, Jocelyn Couture, Janice Finlay, Patricia Deslauriers, Maury LaFoy, Isabelle Wolfmann, John Sadowy, Ken Bibace, Mike Rud, Koen Nys or Shane Mackenzie.</p><p>In 1988, I appeared in the ""Auditions"" section of Downbeat magazine, which showcased promising young musicians. For several years I divided my time between France and Canada and I settled permanently in Montreal in 1990. The same year I was hired as the drummer for Bertold Brecht’s Three Penny Opera, produced by the Concordia University Opera Workshop.</p><p>In 1991, I performed at the Festival International de Jazz de Montréal with the Ensemble de Trombones de Montréal, which notably included in its ranks trombonist Kelsley Grant and pianist Jan Jarczyk. The group won a silver prize at the Quebec finals of the MusicFest Canada jazz competition.</p><p>After obtaining my Bachelor of Music (Jazz Performance Major) in 1993, I continued to work as an independent musician on the Montreal jazz scene. During the same period, I produced and hosted the radio program ""Carnet de notes"" for the CINQ FM 102.3 station. It was at this time that I began to take an interest in computer-assisted music and multimedia programming.</p><p>Between 1994 and 1996 I co-directed the band Alliance, mixing rock, the rhythms of world music and technologies. When the group disbanded, I decided to pursue my training in multimedia at the University of Quebec in Montreal, where I obtained a master's degree in communications in 1998. Since then, computers have been an integral part of my musical instruments and composition tools. Along with my musical career, I work as a digital communications specialist and multimedia developer.</p><p>In 2012, I released an album of electro-acoustic compositions, entitled <i>Fraktal Suite and Other 2-bit Pieces</i> (CD out of print, but available for download on Bandcamp). That year also marked my return to acoustic jazz. I notably played percussion with the Jazz Kartel ensemble and drums with the Grand Ensemble Jazz de Saint-Eustache.</p><p>Since 2019, I am the drummer of the Blue Mondays Jazz Orchestra, with whom I recorded several music videos.</p><p>My influences in jazz are oriented towards classic drummers and their bands like Art Blakey, Elvin Jones, Max Roach, Al Foster, Roy Haynes and Tony Williams but I love and highly respect modern jazz artists like Bob Moses, Ari Hoenig, Chris Potter, George Garzone or John Scofield, to name a few.<br/> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>About Mike Berard</strong></h3><p>Michael Berard is a Jazz Guitarist from Montreal, Canada. His roots are in playing a mostly traditional jazz guitar style with influences from Wes Montgomery and Sonny Stitt as well as modern jazz artists Wayne Shorter and Chick Corea. His first CD, “Good News” is a collection of original compositions and standards. This CD features Canadian jazz legend, Don Thompson.</p><p>Michael was a part-time music professor for over 25 years at Concordia University in Montreal Canada. There he taught jazz guitar, jazz arranging, jazz composition as well as other jazz related courses. He has worked as a jazz musician in Montreal playing jazz clubs, concerts and studio sessions.</p><p>Michael has played on numerous recordings including 3 of his own: ""It's Autumn,"" ""Little Voices"" and ""Good News.”<br/> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>About the musicians</strong></h3><p>I am truly blessed to have assembled around me a crew of highly talented musicians, from Canada, USA and Europe. Besides guitarist, arranger and producer Mike Berard, the following musicians have recorded the three first tracks of the upcoming album or will be featured on the other tracks yet to be recorded:</p><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" style=""width:590px;"" width=""590""><tbody><tr>

To read the musicians’ bios please visit my website: <a href=""http://www.stephanejose.com/music"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">music.stephanejose.com</a>.<br/> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>About this album</strong></h3><p>This album is a very special project for me and it is particularly close to my heart. First of all, it will finally be an opportunity for me to record my own jazz compositions, with high quality arrangements featuring the rich sounds of the trumpet, saxophone and trombone.

Being a versatile musician, I quickly made a name for myself as a drummer in local rock and jazz groups and I had the opportunity to play with some of the best young local musicians of the time, such as Bernard Égreteau, Olivier Gatto, Erik Baron or Do Harson and groups as varied as the Black Bottom Jazz Band, Mahjong or the blues-rock power-trio Baron Dupoil. Between 1985 and 1986, I was recruited as a percussionist and drummer in the French army band (GMR4 57e R.I.).In 1987 I moved to Canada to study jazz at McGill University. There I studied drums with Peter Magadini, André White and Dave Laing, as well as arrangement and composition with Jan Jarczyk. I also counted among my professors musicians Kevin Dean, Gordon Foote, Greg Clayton, Fred Henke, Michel Donato and Benoit Glazer. I attended several workshops and master classes with renowned international musicians, such as Marvin Smith, Ed Thigpen, Peter Erskine, Barry Harris, Steve Lacy or Dave Holland.During these formative years, I had the opportunity to share the stage with musicians who would carve out a name for themselves on the Canadian and European jazz scene, notably Mike Allen, Greg Amirault, Joel Miller, Kelly Jefferson, Christine Jensen, Jocelyn Couture, Janice Finlay, Patricia Deslauriers, Maury LaFoy, Isabelle Wolfmann, John Sadowy, Ken Bibace, Mike Rud, Koen Nys or Shane Mackenzie.In 1988, I appeared in the ""Auditions"" section of Downbeat magazine, which showcased promising young musicians. For several years I divided my time between France and Canada and I settled permanently in Montreal in 1990. The same year I was hired as the drummer for Bertold Brecht’s Three Penny Opera, produced by the Concordia University Opera Workshop.In 1991, I performed at the Festival International de Jazz de Montréal with the Ensemble de Trombones de Montréal, which notably included in its ranks trombonist Kelsley Grant and pianist Jan Jarczyk. The group won a silver prize at the Quebec finals of the MusicFest Canada jazz competition.After obtaining my Bachelor of Music (Jazz Performance Major) in 1993, I continued to work as an independent musician on the Montreal jazz scene. During the same period, I produced and hosted the radio program ""Carnet de notes"" for the CINQ FM 102.3 station. It was at this time that I began to take an interest in computer-assisted music and multimedia programming.Between 1994 and 1996 I co-directed the band Alliance, mixing rock, the rhythms of world music and technologies. When the group disbanded, I decided to pursue my training in multimedia at the University of Quebec in Montreal, where I obtained a master's degree in communications in 1998. Since then, computers have been an integral part of my musical instruments and composition tools. Along with my musical career, I work as a digital communications specialist and multimedia developer.In 2012, I released an album of electro-acoustic compositions, entitled Fraktal Suite and Other 2-bit Pieces (CD out of print, but available for download on Bandcamp). That year also marked my return to acoustic jazz. I notably played percussion with the Jazz Kartel ensemble and drums with the Grand Ensemble Jazz de Saint-Eustache.Since 2019, I am the drummer of the Blue Mondays Jazz Orchestra, with whom I recorded several music videos.My influences in jazz are oriented towards classic drummers and their bands like Art Blakey, Elvin Jones, Max Roach, Al Foster, Roy Haynes and Tony Williams but I love and highly respect modern jazz artists like Bob Moses, Ari Hoenig, Chris Potter, George Garzone or John Scofield, to name a few. About Mike BerardMichael Berard is a Jazz Guitarist from Montreal, Canada. His roots are in playing a mostly traditional jazz guitar style with influences from Wes Montgomery and Sonny Stitt as well as modern jazz artists Wayne Shorter and Chick Corea. His first CD, “Good News” is a collection of original compositions and standards. This CD features Canadian jazz legend, Don Thompson.Michael was a part-time music professor for over 25 years at Concordia University in Montreal Canada. There he taught jazz guitar, jazz arranging, jazz composition as well as other jazz related courses. He has worked as a jazz musician in Montreal playing jazz clubs, concerts and studio sessions.Michael has played on numerous recordings including 3 of his own: ""It's Autumn,"" ""Little Voices"" and ""Good News.” About the musiciansI am truly blessed to have assembled around me a crew of highly talented musicians, from Canada, USA and Europe. Besides guitarist, arranger and producer Mike Berard, the following musicians have recorded the three first tracks of the upcoming album or will be featured on the other tracks yet to be recorded:

Aron Doyle, trumpet, flugelhorn
Billy Kerr, tenor saxophone
Shawn Rinkenbach, alto saxophone
Richard Gagnon, trombone
John Sadowy, piano


Serge Agosh-Koff, bass
John Gavita, bass
Koen Nys, tenor saxophone
Shekinah Rodz, flute, soprano saxophone, percussions
Olivier Gato, bass

The final line up might be slightly different as special guests will join the project along the way. To read the musicians’ bios please visit my website: music.stephanejose.com. About this albumThis album is a very special project for me and it is particularly close to my heart. First of all, it will finally be an opportunity for me to record my own jazz compositions, with high quality arrangements featuring the rich sounds of the trumpet, saxophone and trombone. This music is arranged for sextet or septet, much in the style of the classic Jazz Messengers, but with a modern twist as this is not an homage recording per se.I have written these tunes over the years and to perform them in the company of musicians that I have met throughout my life and whose talent I deeply appreciate is a real blessing.

Cette musique est arrangée pour un sextet ou un septet, dans le style du groupe classique des Jazz Messengers, mais avec une touche moderne, car il ne s’agit pas d’un hommage en soi.J’ai créé ces pièces au fil des ans et le fait de pouvoir les jouer avec des musiciens que j’ai rencontrés à différents moments de ma vie et dont j’apprécie profondément le talent est une chance incroyable. En effet, je connais quelques-uns d’entre eux depuis plus de 25 ans et d’autres sont des connaissances plus récentes. Je veux donc créer une certaine proximité autour de mon projet, afin de connecter avec tous ces musiciens, et ce, peu importe où ils se trouvent, à travers le monde.Passionné de la technologie, je veux repousser les limites de l’improvisation jazz à distance en utilisant tous les moyens technologiques mis à ma disposition, afin que les musiciens puissent interagir de manière musicale et créative, malgré la distance qui les sépare.Avantages de votre soutien :En contribuant un des montants listés en haut à droite de ce site vous aurez acces à plusieurs des avantages

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For as long as I can remember, I've written stories and turned them into songs. As a kid, that looked like fun little songs about trivial things. Now, I'm passionate about creating a soundtrack for every moment of life. Real music for life's realest moments: THAT is my goal. </p>
<p>Being the first instrument I learned and mastered well, piano is my primary instrument, which you’ll see a nod to throughout the album! Funny enough, I taught myself guitar so I could be a country artist. During the recording process, I realized sticking to my roots was more true to the songs I’ve crafted. That truth and honesty has carried through to the feel of the album also as the album takes you on a journey from lighthearted adventures to depths of despair, all while maintaining a semblance of hope and a symphonic southern rock sound.</p>
<p>To me, this campaign is more than raising money for an album. For me, it’s a step into an entirely new level of vulnerability and trust. Trust in the process, in my talents, and in the One who gave them to me. Trust that it will all work out exactly as it’s supposed to. Trust that one person can make an impact on another by following their dreams.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">From the bottom of my heart and the endless stories in my mind, “Where I’m Free” is a 13-song journey where together we explore real life, spontaneous adventures, and finding hope int he midst of heartache. My wish is that this journey into vulnerability will allow you to feel seen and encouraged, while finding your own jam to rock out to!</span></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Now for the numbers part!</p>
<p>We need to raise at least $9,000 to fund this album well, to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking, mixing, and mastering the album</li>
<li>Copyright and other legal fees</li>
<li>A few music videos to accompany </li>
<li>CD’s and distribution</li>
<li>Photography, and social media banners</li>
<li>Marketing, and crowdfunding platform fees</li>
<li>Shipping and Merch (*factored into rewards prices)</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don’t reach the full goal, funds will be distributed pretty much in the order listed with the rest coming squarely out of my husband’s pocket! (Poor guy..)</p>
<p>BUT THE PERKS!</p>
<p>Y’all, I’m ridiculously excited to give you perks for your donations, so I can thank you as much as possible! These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Song dedications and FREE downloads!</li>
<li>First look at videos!</li>
<li>BRAND NEW Merch</li>
<li>Zoom Meetings to learn to play your favorite songs</li>
<li>CD Pre-Orders</li>
<li>Backstage passes for life!</li>
<li>Your name printed in the “THANK YOU” section of the CD slip cover</li>
<li>AND MORE</li>
</ul>
<p>Ugh. I can’t even wait for you to see it all!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Honestly, at the beginning of this project I didn’t truly believe in myself as much as I did the music itself. This whole process has been mind-blowing in more ways than I can put into words. For one, I have personally grown from a timid singer with a couple good songs, to a confident musician having to keep my passion in check in order to serve the true message of each song well! When the album is fully funded and can go live? Man. That will LITERALLY be a dream come true. </p>
<p>Beyond that, my mission has never been to simply feel “accomplished” and pursue my dreams. It has been to inspire and encourage others in many ways, but mainly remind that “you are not alone.” Ever. Even when it feels like you should run and have no reason to stay, even when marriage or relationships are hard, even when you suffer unimaginable loss.. EVEN THEN, you are never alone. You are seen and known.</p>
<p>If this album is funded and can see the light of day, that is just one message that I am humbled to present to the world in my own unique way.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As if I haven’t been honest enough so far, let me be more so.. This is a BIG risk. Out of an over abundance of practicality, I didn’t choose the “all-or-nothing” method (first time in my life, y’all). Even so, if I don’t reach my goal, the fees alone will be enough to make me catch my breath.</p>
<p>AND YET, I paid for myself to go to college without debt, and in one semester moved twice and drove 50 miles with $4 to my name... in change I found in the trunk. I’m determined, y’all. This is GOING to happen! (...don’t make me do it alone?)</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I also understand that not everyone can donate the minimum $15 to someone else’s dream. THAT IS TOTALLY FINE! There are SO MANY other ways you can support the cause, and I would be honored to know you simply gave time and passion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out and make some noise about the campaign!</li>
<li>Tell your friends about the album and past singles! </li>
<li>Subscribe to the email list and follow on social media!</li>
<li>Use hashtags #selahluke and #whereimfree while posting about the music!</li>
<li>Stream the singles, and add them to Spotify playlists!</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Help Us Fund SolSatellite's First Full-Length Album</h3>
<p>SolSatellite is a five-piece progressive neo-soul band from Denver, Broomfield, and Boulder, Colorado. The band started in 2016 and has gone through several line-up changes since then. Our first EP was written before the lineup was finalized. Once we landed on the current lineup, some real magic has occurred in our writing that we are very excited to share with the world. For those of us who have caught our live shows, you already have a sneak-peak at a lot of the new content we've been creating together! </p>
<p>The new album isn't something we can do without your help. We tried to go the self-recorded, produced, and mixed route to save money, but we honestly think we'll get the best product and truest representation of our vision by working with professional sound engineers. Without being able to gig the past year and a half, it's been difficult to save up money for recording. Solsatellite's direction has changed significantly since the EP was released and we want to give you all a better representation of where our hearts and our art is at. We're really excited about the new songs!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal for funding is $7,500. We have recording sessions booked at Colorado Sound with an outstanding engineer starting in October. Our studio dates are booked! The money from this fundraiser all goes towards creating the best album possible, printing the album, and creating the physical perks to send to all those who support us.</p>
<p>We don't expect you to give us money for nothing (unless you want to)! We have lots of perks lined up to express our thanks for your contributions. Of course, there's the classics like a copy of the album and t-shirts. Everyone in the band is a professional music teacher and we will teach a private lesson with you on the instrument of your choice. We'll take you out to lunch. We'll play any song you want, or even write you your very own song! You can kick it with us at a private party and listen to our album before everybody else. </p>
<p>(If we don't reach the entire goal for this fundraiser, the funds will still go towards the album recording first and foremost. The album recording may take longer than hoped for as we make up the difference out of pocket. The delivery of merch perks will be delayed a bit as we will have to cover the print of them after the album recording is paid for. Hopefully it doesn't come to this so we can keep the album on track and get you your perks as soon as possible.)</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>These songs mean the world to us. We have nourished them from seedling ideas to full-fledged visions of sound and feeling. It gives us all a sense of purpose to share our music with you, and to see the audience feedback at our shows proves to us that these songs are felt and shared by others. It's beautiful to see a range of responses, from dancing to crying to smiling. The support of our fans and friends has floored us, fueled us, and humbled us. We love each of you and are dedicated to fostering the connection and joy that has been cultivated in our community through music. </p>
<p>Beyond what the songs originally mean to us, they become so much more when they are shared. It's amazing how people of such different backgrounds can come together over the same emotions while interpreting the songs in a way that's entirely their own through the lenses of their personal experiences. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Aside from financial barriers, there aren't a ton of risks involved with recording the album. We are wary of the ongoing pandemic and will adapt our recording plans as needed to interact safely. We are all vaccinated but with the delta variant and ever-changing restrictions, it is something we hopefully won't have to change course for but that we are willing to if necessary. The only thing the pandemic can do is delay is, but it won't stop us. The album will be born!</p>
<p>Another aspect which creates time sensitivity is our bass play Mo is getting surgery at the end of October and will be out of commission for about 6 weeks during recovery. We have our studio dates booked for before the surgery and will hopefully be finished recording by then. However, if something does end up delaying our process, we would have to push recording back a couple of months. Either way, our album should still be out at the beginning of 2022.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>""How Else Can I Help?""</h3>
<p>We understand that financial contributions aren't always possible, but no worries-- there are still ways to support us without putting yourself out. Spreading the word is HUGE in helping our campaign be a success. Tell your friends, tell your families, tell strangers. Following us on Spotify, Facebook, and Instagram is another way to support us for free. Share our existing music, put our songs on your playlists, hype us up to others! All of that is important to our success and we are deeply grateful for every effort on our behalf.</p>

<h3><strong>Zero Miles To Empty</strong></h3>
<p>I'm Robbie Carlson, born in Alaska and now living in Texas. I've lived and learned in so many places along the way. I started playing guitar, along with bass and piano, when I was just a kid, driving my mother crazy with a drum set that she surely regretted getting me! Most everyone describes my music as real and raw. It's always been my way of dealing with life's ups and downs. I never would've thought I'd be up on stage performing for audiences, but now it all makes sense. There's nothing more fulfilling and rewarding than sharing my passion with anyone and everyone!</p>
<p>This album ""<strong>RAVEN</strong>"" consists of 9 songs, which we started recording in the studio back in October of 2015. I've put everything into this, as I'm sure you'll hear and feel when you listen to it.</p>
<p>I've put together some great incentives for you as a contributor, and you get to be part of the creative process and help me share my passion with the world! Imagine watching a great new movie or TV show and hearing a song from this album -- and knowing you helped make it possible! </p>

I'm Robbie Carlson, born in Alaska and now living in Texas. I've lived and learned in so many places along the way. I started playing guitar, along with bass and piano, when I was just a kid, driving my mother crazy with a drum set that she surely regretted getting me! Most everyone describes my music as real and raw. It's always been my way of dealing with life's ups and downs. I never would've thought I'd be up on stage performing for audiences, but now it all makes sense. There's nothing more fulfilling and rewarding than sharing my passion with anyone and everyone!
This album ""RAVEN"" consists of 9 songs, which we started recording in the studio back in October of 2015. I've put everything into this, as I'm sure you'll hear and feel when you listen to it.
I've put together some great incentives for you as a contributor, and you get to be part of the creative process and help me share my passion with the world! Imagine watching a great new movie or TV show and hearing a song from this album -- and knowing you helped make it possible!

<a href=""http://www.ram-nyc.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Random Access Music</a> (RAM) is a collective of composers and performers based in NYC. Our mission is to promote the composition and performance of music by living composers in venues throughout NYC, in other areas of the U.S., and abroad; to foster an engaging collaborative spirit between composers and performers; to deliver dynamic programming through concert presentations, educational outreach, and the annual Queens New Music Festival.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This year, RAM is the recipient of several grants: from the Department of Cultural Affairs, The Alice M. Ditson Fund,  and from NYSCA as administered by the Queens Council on the Arts. These grants show the value RAM adds to the new music community and to the borough of Queens. We are eager to further develop our growing yearly festival in what is thus far an underserved area of New York City.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here is where you come in! You have the opportunity to play a significant role in helping us create a matching fund to help us produce the QNMF and RAM's Educational Outreach program. Our goal is to raise $10,000.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Your donation will go toward compensating the artists who bring their passion and talent for musical performance and help us secure the future development of the Queens New Music Festival, RAM's educational outreach, and our presence in the borough of Queens. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>A little more detail about what we do:</div>
<div> </div>
<p>RAM produces several concert programs each season: new and recent works of our composer members’ music performed by the RAM Players (our own ensemble), music by other composers as part of Eavesdropping – a concert series curated by RAM composers and performers, and one concert of premieres performed by a collaborating ensemble.</p>
<p>RAM also presents the Queens New Music Festival (QNMF) in Queens, NY, along with our partner, Musica Reginae. The festival is now in its sixth year. We issue a call for scores and concert proposals; five performers/ensembles are chosen to participate in the QNMF.  Selection is based upon artistic quality, diversity, and audience potential. We work with the invited ensembles and selected composers to provide performance opportunities at the QNMF. In presenting the QNMF, RAM celebrates the creation and performance of new musical works and enhances the cultural and musical landscape in Queens.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>HUMANOMALY</h3>
<p>We started working on this album about one year ago. We are very proud of the sound so far —from uptempo pop tunes to dreamy atmospheres. The lyrics revolve around our view of the world today —  leaving a mark, being loved, dying, martyrdom, populism and human anomalies. <br/>Or the human as the anomaly of the world.</p>
<p><br/>All songs are more or less done, but there's a lot of expenses to go.<br/>So please support us by ""pre-ordering"" the album!</p>
<p><br/>Main expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mixing (by the great Måns Lundberg)</li>
<li>Mastering</li>
<li>CD and Vinyl pressings.</li>
<li>Promotion</li>
<li>Merchandise<br/> </li>
</ul>

<h3>Why €10 000, flexible funds?</h3>
<p>The truth is, we don't need that much money to make an album.<br/>But! To be able to do everything the way we want it, we need it.<br/>In other words. If we get less, the album will very very likely still be done.<br/>Maybe we need to use a cheaper type of printing on the album covers.<br/>Maybe we can't afford that music video.

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>Ever since I was five years old, I knew that I wanted to be on the stage. I grew up in Pinehurst, North Carolina where I learned to play piano, guitar, write songs, and performed in several plays and musicals. After graduating high school, I moved to New York City to study musical theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. In my last semester I came to the realization that I didn't want to act and decided to go back to my singer/songwriter roots. I came home after graduation, recorded my EP, Casino Sessions, and moved to Nashville soon after. I've lived in Nashville for almost a year now and I absolutely love it. I have made some great friends, made lots of connections, and written a ton of music. </p>
<p>Like I mentioned before I recorded an EP last year but it is time to release some more, new music. It's my dream to be a singer and tour the world sharing my music and I am hoping that this album is just the start. This campaign is designed to help with the funding of what comes after recording such as the publicity and distribution to get this music to you. Any way you would like to contribute would mean the world to me! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am releasing this album independently; meaning that my mom and I have been saving up the money to pay for it. We've got most of it but we just need a little bit more. Through this campaign I'm hoping to raise $1000. This money is going to go to a publicist who will help promote the album through a Spotify campaign, radio time, and reviews of the album. It will also be going towards making the physical copies of the album and all of the merchandise I hope to offer! Even if I don't meet my goal, any money raised will be going towards the promotion of the album.</li>
<li>There are several different ways to contribute and fun rewards in doing so!<ul>
<li>If you'd like to donate but can't afford to give a lot, there's a ""$5 if you love me"" option and you'll get a personal thank you from me!</li>

<p>My name is Andrew Neu
and I’m a saxophone player and composer. I’ve been touring the world with Bobby
Caldwell, Diane Schuur, Smokey Robinson, and many more. After years of playing,
conducting, and writing for big bands, it’s finally time to record my own big
band jazz arrangements. I have a 17 piece band I lead with trumpeter, Anthony
Bonsera. We’ve been rehearsing in Los Angeles, CA for 5 years. The musicians in
this band play on movie soundtracks, TV (Dancing with the Stars, Family Guy, American
Idol), and major pop/jazz artist tours. </p>
<p>Many of my compositions
are published by Kendor Music, a publisher that also publishes music by Sammy
Nestico, Thad Jones and Bob Mintzer. They can be found at the link below…</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.kendormusic.com/store/index.php?_a=viewCat&amp;catId=462"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.kendormusic.com/store/index.php?_a=viewCat&amp;catId=462</a></p>
<p>They have been played
by musicians all around the world including the USA, Japan and Europe. Bobby
Caldwell recorded six of my charts on his recent CD, After Dark. Former Gordon
Goodwin Phat Band drummer, Bernie Dresel recorded three of my charts on his
upcoming CD. </p>
I like to
think that my music makes people happy and I feel that it’s time to make these
pieces available in their most perfect form: recorded in an historical and
legendary studio by a great band that’s passionate about the art form of big
band jazz. <p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>The core band is made
up 17 musicians. These are the same musicians who have been rehearsing for free
for the past five years. They are all full time professional musicians who need
to be paid for their services.  </p>
<p>In addition to the
band we’ll also be reaching out to “all-star” musicians as guest soloists
(Brian Bromberg, who is also one of the producers of this project, will be one
of them!). I’ve been fortunate to have built great relationships with some of
the finest artists in jazz and I know their contributions will be worth it.
We’ll announce these artists as we confirm them!</p>
<p>Recording a big band
requires a big studio that understands the needs of this type of project.
Fortunately Los Angeles is home to some of the best studios in the world along
with a tradition of recording some of the finest big bands in jazz history from
Frank Sinatra to Gordon Goodwin. </p>
The bulk of
the recording is expected to be done in two six-hour recording sessions
followed by over dubs for soloists and percussion. This is a well rehearsed
crew of veteran musicians who will not waste time in the studio. All of this
will be documented by a photographer and a small film crew. Then comes mixing
and mastering. At that point we’ll need to have a graphic designer step in on
the packaging, and then finally the manufacturing. </div><div>
<p>A project of this
magnitude can cost upwards of $50,000, however we’ve made every effort to
control the costs by being well rehearsed and highly professional, so as not to
waste expensive studio time. We have a team of people who have worked on my
last three solo jazz CDs. You can take a listen to them here...</p>

<h3>About the EP and Me...</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Hannah Olivia. I started performing and busking at the age of 16 and now at age 18 I continue to pursue music through busking, performing live at cafes/restaurants/bars as well as events/functions, and being a part of the worship team at my church. I began writing music well before I started performing, and as part of a pretty musically gifted family, it's always been a big part of life and in my blood. At the moment I'm in the process of recording my debut EP which is exciting! It also brings me to the point of this campaign.</p>
<p>I've started this campaign in order to fund the completion of the EP. It's proving to be an incredible project and a literal dream come true for me and something that I definitely want to keep pursuing as far as writing, recording and performing. I'll put it this way; I can't not do music. So, as a contributor to this project, you would be helping me to achieve this next step in my music journey, and supporting one of my biggest dreams. </p>
<p>The vibe of my EP is acoustic, ballady, and reminds me of Summer; perfect for chilling and cruising along the beach. I can't wait for you to hear it.</p>
<p>Any donation big or small means so much.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here are the details:</p>
<p>- I'm aiming for $4000 which will go toward booking the studio, recording the final parts and post-production (eg. Mixing, mastering, ordering supplies and making it available).</p>
<p>- For donations from $20 and up there are some awesome rewards. See the 'Perks' section.</p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>

<p>Greetings! My name is Nyk Edinger. I am the vocalist for Possession, a unique death metal band from Kansas City in the USA. </p>
<p>We have just reached the 20th Anniversary of the release of our full length album, Eternally Haunt. Possession's music is a unique blend of thrash metal and death metal, more influenced by European metal than our American counterparts. </p>
<p>To celebrate this milestone, I am working on re-issuing a double disc of all the Possession material ever recorded. This will include all the original releases, many with higher quality sound than the originals, three remixed songs from the album Eternally Haunt, two cover songs, one by King Diamond and the other by Iron Maiden, and a previously unreleased track featuring the legendary death metal drummer, John Longstreth. It will also include all the full size original artwork as well as a new cover for this release.</p>
<p>I am excited to share all this with Possession fans from around the globe, but I need your help!</p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Goal:</h3> <p><br/></p>
<p>I am working hard to make this re-issue worth the twenty year wait. With original and new artwork, all the lyrics, additional photos and memorabilia as well as all the music, unreleased and remixed, I want this double CD to be exceptional. Of course this requires funds. On my end there is the cost of new artwork, digitizing music and video from old tapes, scanning and digital editing costs and studio time for remixing and remastering. </p>
<p>This is where you come in. Either as a fan or as someone who just wants to see this project come to fruition, your contribution will help me make this a reality this year. Every $5-$20-$50 will go a long way to making this happen. Plus, you get guarantee of the first copies that are released as well as other cool Possession swag only available through this funding project. There will be signed CDs and also signed promo shots from 1995, an exclusive Possession t-shirt and a print from the original Eternally Haunt artwork plus a couple other goodies!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Reason:</h3> <p><br/></p>
<p>Possession existed in a time very different from the world of today. We formed at the cusp of the INTERNET revolution. Possession (from all the research we did at the time) was the first band to have a page hosted on the World Wide Web. We also were the first band to make music available for download from the INTERNET. A 20 second clip from one of our songs would take upwards of 20 minutes to download! </p>
<p>As advanced as we were in trying to make our music available to the world from the center of the USA, we were equally advanced in the creation of our style of metal. No one sounded like Possession before or since, but many of the things we did have cropped up in death and black metal releases in the years after. </p>
<p>However, with the last recording occurring in 1999, Possession quickly became a band who was mentioned in metal circles but many had never had the pleasure of hearing. Our CDs sold out and were never released again. </p>
<p>I get emails and messages on a weekly basis from people all over the world who have heard a song or heard a story and want to know where to buy our music. With this re-issue I hope to bring our entire catalog to those who have been searching for years and to those who have yet to hear our music. Today's metal fan is much more prepared for what Possession created and I am excited to make it all available again.</p>
<p>Becoming a part of this effort will be an amazing experience for all involved as the world is re-introduced to Possession again.</p>

</div></div>","POSSESSION - Death Metal Ahead of it's Time 
Greetings! My name is Nyk Edinger. I am the vocalist for Possession, a unique death metal band from Kansas City in the USA. 
We have just reached the 20th Anniversary of the release of our full length album, Eternally Haunt. Possession's music is a unique blend of thrash metal and death metal, more influenced by European metal than our American counterparts. 
To celebrate this milestone, I am working on re-issuing a double disc of all the Possession material ever recorded. This will include all the original releases, many with higher quality sound than the originals, three remixed songs from the album Eternally Haunt, two cover songs, one by King Diamond and the other by Iron Maiden, and a previously unreleased track featuring the legendary death metal drummer, John Longstreth. It will also include all the full size original artwork as well as a new cover for this release.
I am excited to share all this with Possession fans from around the globe, but I need your help!   
The Goal: 
I am working hard to make this re-issue worth the twenty year wait. With original and new artwork, all the lyrics, additional photos and memorabilia as well as all the music, unreleased and remixed, I want this double CD to be exceptional. Of course this requires funds. On my end there is the cost of new artwork, digitizing music and video from old tapes, scanning and digital editing costs and studio time for remixing and remastering. 
This is where you come in. Either as a fan or as someone who just wants to see this project come to fruition, your contribution will help me make this a reality this year. Every $5-$20-$50 will go a long way to making this happen. Plus, you get guarantee of the first copies that are released as well as other cool Possession swag only available through this funding project. There will be signed CDs and also signed promo shots from 1995, an exclusive Possession t-shirt and a print from the original Eternally Haunt artwork plus a couple other goodies!
    
The Reason: 
Possession existed in a time very different from the world of today. We formed at the cusp of the INTERNET revolution. Possession (from all the research we did at the time) was the first band to have a page hosted on the World Wide Web. We also were the first band to make music available for download from the INTERNET. A 20 second clip from one of our songs would take upwards of 20 minutes to download! 
As advanced as we were in trying to make our music available to the world from the center of the USA, we were equally advanced in the creation of our style of metal. No one sounded like Possession before or since, but many of the things we did have cropped up in death and black metal releases in the years after. 
However, with the last recording occurring in 1999, Possession quickly became a band who was mentioned in metal circles but many had never had the pleasure of hearing. Our CDs sold out and were never released again. 
I get emails and messages on a weekly basis from people all over the world who have heard a song or heard a story and want to know where to buy our music. With this re-issue I hope to bring our entire catalog to those who have been searching for years and to those who have yet to hear our music. Today's metal fan is much more prepared for what Possession created and I am excited to make it all available again.
Becoming a part of this effort will be an amazing experience for all involved as the world is re-introduced to Possession again.
    
Thank you! 
First I want to thank Xtreem Music for approaching me with the idea of a re-release of this scale. Without their excitement and inspiration this may have never happened. I also want to thank YOU!  
Whether you are only able to contribute $5 to this project or are able to do more, your support will go even further than the dollars.

<h3> </h3>
<p>Hi there! </p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by and checking out this page.  My name is Bianca Rose and I've been creating and sharing music for many years.  After independently releasing an EP (Truths and Tiny Tragedies), writing and collaborating with other artists, and taking a break away from it all, I've recorded my debut album <i>No Fear Here </i>which I'm incredibly proud of! We are now ready to release this body of work and would love for you pre-order the album in order to raise the funds to cover the release costs.  I really believe in this music and I think it deserves to be heard.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Journey from Fear to Hope</strong></h3>
<p>I don't really know when or how it started, but after diving in and living deeply in music for a few years, one day I just started saying no.  No to writing, no to sharing, no to doing life with music.  After a while I couldn't say yes even if I wanted to.  After a few years, much life, and some particularly low moments, I felt myself step back into hope, and my lifeline of creativity.</p>
<p>The <i>No Fear Here</i> album is a song cycle of my initial musings on this wilderness period of fear and doubt which completely incapacitated me creatively. 80% of this album encompasses the very first song-thoughts that came to me following this time, and releasing this works feels like the best way to serve that experience and document the lessons learnt.</p>
<p>Produced by the wonderful talented and critically acclaimed Femi Temowo [George Benson,Andrea Bocelli,Amy Winehouse,The Roots, ESKA &amp; Soweto Kinch], it was an absolute honour to have world class musicians such as Troy Miller [Amy Winehouse, Mark Ronson, Laura Mvula, Roy Ayers], Karl Rasheed-Abel [Lauva Mvula, Ms Dynamite, Jerry Dammers and Courtney Pine] and James Douglas [Laura Mvula] play on this record.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Budget</h3>
<p>So I've self-funded the recording (including studio time, musicians, live string and horn sections (!!!), mixing, artwork etc), and release of the first single and accompanying video.  The push towards the finishing line is going cost around £5k, so I'm hoping we can smash the £3k target to pieces!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Single and Video</strong> - We have some wonderfully exciting ideas for visuals to support this album, I can't wait to bring the music and message to life!</li>
<li>
<strong>PR</strong> - Sounds boring, but this is such a crucial part of the process. Employing a PR company is a vital component to ensuring that as many people get to hear this work as possible, as well as produce more opportunities for me to share this album live in as many places as possible, both regionally and internationally.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mastering &amp; CD Printing</strong>   </li>
</ul>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In exchange for your generosity,I'm offering a menu of perks.  I'd just love you all to come to pre-order the album!</p>
<p>In addition to the items listed, I'm willing to offer unlisted perks, so if you are interested in an unlisted perk, please reach out. I'm ready to get creative!</p>
<p>Otherwise there is the 'BACK IT', button above if you'd just like to contribute (thank you).</p>
<p>If we don't reach the goal, which I'm confident we will, I'll use whatever funds received to go towards the budget above and keep pushing forward.  </p>
</div><div><p>If you are unable to contribute financially, you can still help me out! I'd be deeply grateful if you would consider reposting a link to the fundraising page and a few words about why your peeps should check it out.</p></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every part of this project has called for me to be brave.  I've figured for the message of <i>No Fear Here</i> to have the most weight, it would make sense for me to make sure that every move and decision I make is the bravest possible, be it stepping back into live performance, creating a music video of me stripping away all of my makeup and baring my naked face to the world (see above), or asking you all to help me financially over the last hurdle. It's all a beautiful risk and a challenge.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You may not be able to contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can <strong>use the Indiegogo</strong> share tools to tell others about my campaign, (please, and thank you).</li>

<h3>A new home for Bowerbird</h3>
<p>Bowerbird is celebrating our 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary, and after years of bouncing around venue to venue, we have the chance to make a new home at University Lutheran.  </p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a <strong>beautiful sanctuary</strong> space for concerts – with a <strong>pipe organ </strong>– and we have received a generous gift from the Anton family of a concert quality <strong>Steinway piano, </strong> which will be moved into the space in early 2017. <br/> </li>
<li>It’s got a<strong> great location</strong> at 37<sup>th</sup> and Chestnut – next door to International House and many other cultural organizations – with easy access to public transportation and parking. <br/> </li>
<li>Plus there’s a <strong>fellowship hall</strong> for classes, workshops, meals, and other gatherings.<br/> </li>
<li>And most importantly – <strong>office space</strong> to make it all happen.<br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>We Need Your Support</h3>
<p>Your donations will help cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Rental fees:</strong> As tenants, University Lutheran has offered us fantastic rates and while the per-event cost to Bowerbird is lower than we would pay elsewhere, there is an initial capital investment we must make now to realize these savings and support program expansion.  <br/> </li>
<li>In order to present a full range of artists, we will need to purchase a <strong>PA system, microphones, cables and other sound equipment</strong> to produce concerts.<br/> </li>
<li>We need to outfit the new office space with<strong> furniture, shelving and secure storage, and other office equipment</strong>.   <br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While we will continue present events at other venues - including our series at The Rotunda - this new home will become the <strong>main hub of all of Bowerbird's programming</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Producing events at a this single location, especially with our offices on site, will <strong>greatly decrease the administrative workload</strong> of producing events.  This great saving in admin time will allow us to both increase the number of events we produce annually and allow us to develop other types of programming - <strong>workshops, classes, and artist residencies</strong>.  <br/> </li>

Robert and Isaac - A Different Thread
 
Who are we? 
‘A Different Thread’ consists of the travelling singer songwriter Robert Jackson and versatile classical cellist Isaac Collier.  With his distinctive voice, bluesy harmonica and rhythmic guitar picking, Jackson’s songs cleverly weave together adventure, bitter romance and synchronicity with “Thought provoking, well crafted lyrics” - Gordon Giltrap. Collier’s enchanting and often improvised playing gives this folk duo a refreshing and impulsive edge.

<h3>A New Recording Studio in Western Massachusetts</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483395060/jjwcihgrjhuwicnoehwj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Sonic Titan Studios is a new recording studio based in Western Massachusetts that is owned and operated by two engineers/drummers with a shared passion for heavy metal, DIY ethics, Rush, New England sports teams, and high-quality audio recordings with an emphasis on organic production and techniques.  </p>
<p>Although we only met this past year, we’ve both been actively pursuing careers in the audio field since our teenage years, earned our degrees from respected audio engineering programs, and set out to open our own home-based recording studios after graduating.  Now, we’re taking the next step and partnering up to create the dedicated, finely-tuned, and professional recording environment we’ve been dreaming about for years.</p>
<p>In late August 2016, the former Eastlake Studios location in Shelburne Falls, MA went on the market for rent.  It was the exact opportunity we'd both been looking for, but it came on short notice - about 10 days from the initial discovery to signing the lease, leaving us limited time to raise funds.  We've already invested plenty of time, effort, and money into the studio, but we believe there's so much potential still there.  We're determined to make Sonic Titan Studios a world-class studio with top-of-the-line gear, an acoustically sound multi-use space, and a comfortable work environment for bands and artists of all genres.</p>
<p>We can make this happen with your help!  We’ve decided to turn to IndieGogo to raise funds to improve and outfit the studio to get us off the ground.  In return we’re offering some exclusive perks for our supporters and discounted recording packages for musicians and bands interested in recording with us.</p>

<h3>Goal and Budgeting</h3>
<p>We’ve decided to set our goal at <strong>$10,000.</strong>  This number represents the approximate combined figure of our startup costs, our pending necessary expenditures, and future wishlist Items. Because we’re running a Flexible Funding campaign, we’re able to keep any amount of money raised even if we don’t hit our goal.  In the event that we don’t reach our goal, we’ve prioritized how we will utilize campaign funds below.</p>
<p>The Control Room was in a nearly-ready state when we moved in, as we purchased the existing acoustic treatment from the previous tenants.  However, the Live Room was stripped bare, with unpainted walls, no acoustic treatment, and a concrete floor.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/kmHp_YB0oeM?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>Our first task was a complete overhaul of the Live Room, with a new coat of paint on the walls and ceiling, a new vinyl floor, DIY acoustic panels mounted on the walls and ceiling, and a new XLR snake, D-Sub cable, and TRS fantail for our mic and headphone lines.  Those construction costs and the rent accrued during that time account for most of our initial spending, and therefore are our priority for allocating campaign funds:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1200 - First two months rent during construction</li>
<li>$700 - Control Room acoustic treatment</li>
<li>$200 - Live Room painting</li>
<li>$150 - Live Room concrete floor patching and leveling</li>
<li>$1000 - Live Room flooring</li>
<li>$400 - Live Room acoustic treatment</li>
<li>$800 - Live Room wiring</li>
<li>$200 - Rolling storage cart</li>
<li>$300 - Garage drywall and insulation</li>
<li>$500 - Control Room computer screens and mounting hardware</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we both had our own home-based recording studios prior to partnering up, we’ve had much of the necessary equipment to get things up and running.  However, there’s a couple of areas in which we're in need of additions or upgrades:</p>
<ul>
<li>$480 - Studio headphones</li>
<li>$1000 - Microphones</li>
<li>$600 - Mic stands</li>
<li>$500 - Furniture</li>
<li>$300 - Bunk bed for lounge</li>
</ul>
<p>These last items are non-essential to the basic operation of the studio, but are purchases we would like to make further down the line once we have a steady stream of clients:</p>
<ul>
<li>$650 - Microphones</li>
<li>$325 - XLR cables</li>
<li>$500 - Cabinets and shelving for kitchenette</li>
<li>$500 - Acoustic treatment for iso booths</li>
<li>$800 - Permanent XLR wiring for iso booths and hallway</li>
<li>$3000 - Baby Grand Piano</li>
</ul>

<p>My passion for music started a very young age - I started taking piano lessons at the age of 4, picked up percussion at 10, and performed in nearly every school ensemble throughout my youth.  I got my first drum set for Christmas in 7th grade and immediately started a punk band, which then spurred my interest in live sound and recording.  In 2004, my dad and I formed PDP Productions to organize concerts and provide live sound in the Western Massachusetts area.  After receiving my Bachelor’s in Sound Recording Technology from UMass Lowell in 2009, I interned at Zing Studios in the summer of 2009 and officially launched PDP Recording that fall.  With PDP Recording, my engineering credits have included King Parrot, Barishi, Lich King, Condition Critical, Hannah Hoffman, Epicenter, and Vacant Eyes, as well as in-game remixes for the Rock Band Network for artists such as Between the Buried and Me, A Day to Remember, Periphery, and The Faceless.</p>

<p>My passion for recording began in parallel with my passion for music and drumming when I was 10 years old. Ever since then my path through recording technology was guided by a constant compulsion to merge art and creativity with theory and engineering with whatever means were available to me, concurrently fostering a strong DIY mindset. I carried that drive with me throughout my grade-school years which enabled me to enroll in Berklee College of Music where I graduated with a Bachelor of Music Degree in Music Production and Engineering in 2015. My experience in the MP&amp;E Program allowed me to merge my DIY ethos with a strong foundation in how a professional studio is run and how to achieve the best tones possible.</p>
<p>Much of my experience has been engineering and mixing for the multitude of bands I've been in over the years, most notably my current band <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/gravitonmetal/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Graviton</a> where I produced, engineered, mixed, and mastered the Fundamental Violence EP. I've also done drum editing for The Offering, vocal production for the Aversed EP, and mixed the eponymous Black Tomb debut release.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We’ve both been serious about owning and operating a professional recording studio for years, and this campaign is our chance to make it a reality.  However, the opportunity for us to move into the studio space came on short notice - less than 10 days from the initial discovery to signing the lease - and as a result we’ve had to move quickly with our planning and expenditures.  Every contribution helps us get Sonic Titan Studios up and running as soon as possible and allows us to make further improvements and purchases down the line to provide higher quality and more varied services to our clients.</p>
<p>Our confidence in our ability to run a studio comes from our experience in all sides of the business.  As musicians, we understand the need to have high quality audio and video recordings while keeping expenses to a minimum.  As experienced audio engineers, we understand every factor that affects the quality of the recording, from the preparation of the musicians, to the acoustics of the recording room, to the fine details of signal flow and processing.  As business owners, we understand the importance of location and demographics, the benefits of a pleasing and comfortable work environment, and the need for publicity, marketing, and outreach.</p>
<p>Both of us have a lengthy track record of successful music and audio related endeavors, and we firmly believe that Sonic Titan Studios will be the continuation of that success.  Brian has been instrumental in the growth of PDP Productions over the past 14 years, transforming a company providing budget speakers for punk shows at the local teen center into a full-scale live sound and lighting supplier for outdoor festivals and events with over 10,000 attendees.  PDP Recording has evolved in a similar fashion, from creating demo CDs for local bands to working on full-length albums and projects for respected independent labels such as Season of Mist, Housecore Records, and Sumerian Records.  Brian is also one of the chief organizers of RPM Fest, an annual three-day heavy music and camping festival in Western Massachusetts that has tripled in attendance since its inception in 2014.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Opening and maintaining any small business is an incredibly challenging undertaking, and opening a small business in the music industry is even more difficult. While retail businesses, for example, are able to rely on a steady cycle of consumption and necessity from their customers, surviving in the recording industry so often comes down to word-of-mouth of one’s work, which itself is subjectively determined both sonically and personally. The health of the music scene and the popularity of a given genre also have a very serious impact on the viability of a studio. What this all must be confronted with is the means and will to adapt to an extremely fluid business landscape. We are of the firm belief that our combined skill sets and experience from years spent at distinguished recording institutes, live sound engineering, being active members of a flourishing music community, and successful album production have equipped us with the ability to make these adaptations to keep Sonic Titan Studios a healthy business and present clients with a professional but highly creative atmosphere, and the highest quality recordings we can possibly achieve.</p>

We would be extremely grateful if you'd share this Indiegogo page using the social media buttons at the top of this page.  You would be directly nurturing the realization of a dream for us!</p></div>","A New Recording Studio in Western Massachusetts

You probably know me best as the drummer for Lich King, one of the founders and organizers of RPM Fest, or the guy behind the sound for PDP Productions, Klondike Sound Company, or the 13th Floor Music Lounge.

I've also done drum editing for The Offering, vocal production for the Aversed EP, and mixed the eponymous Black Tomb debut release.
 

 
The Impact
We’ve both been serious about owning and operating a professional recording studio for years, and this campaign is our chance to make it a reality.  However, the opportunity for us to move into the studio space came on short notice - less than 10 days from the initial discovery to signing the lease - and as a result we’ve had to move quickly with our planning and expenditures.  Every contribution helps us get Sonic Titan Studios up and running as soon as possible and allows us to make further improvements and purchases down the line to provide higher quality and more varied services to our clients.
Our confidence in our ability to run a studio comes from our experience in all sides of the business.  As musicians, we understand the need to have high quality audio and video recordings while keeping expenses to a minimum.  As experienced audio engineers, we understand every factor that affects the quality of the recording, from the preparation of the musicians, to the acoustics of the recording room, to the fine details of signal flow and processing.  As business owners, we understand the importance of location and demographics, the benefits of a pleasing and comfortable work environment, and the need for publicity, marketing, and outreach.
Both of us have a lengthy track record of successful music and audio related endeavors, and we firmly believe that Sonic Titan Studios will be the continuation of that success.  Brian has been instrumental in the growth of PDP Productions over the past 14 years, transforming a company providing budget speakers for punk shows at the local teen center into a full-scale live sound and lighting supplier for outdoor festivals and events with over 10,000 attendees.  PDP Recording has evolved in a similar fashion, from creating demo CDs for local bands to working on full-length albums and projects for respected independent labels such as Season of Mist, Housecore Records, and Sumerian Records.  Brian is also one of the chief organizers of RPM Fest, an annual three-day heavy music and camping festival in Western Massachusetts that has tripled in attendance since its inception in 2014.
 

Risks & Challenges
Opening and maintaining any small business is an incredibly challenging undertaking, and opening a small business in the music industry is even more difficult. While retail businesses, for example, are able to rely on a steady cycle of consumption and necessity from their customers, surviving in the recording industry so often comes down to word-of-mouth of one’s work, which itself is subjectively determined both sonically and personally. The health of the music scene and the popularity of a given genre also have a very serious impact on the viability of a studio. What this all must be confronted with is the means and will to adapt to an extremely fluid business landscape. We are of the firm belief that our combined skill sets and experience from years spent at distinguished recording institutes, live sound engineering, being active members of a flourishing music community, and successful album production have equipped us with the ability to make these adaptations to keep Sonic Titan Studios a healthy business and present clients with a professional but highly creative atmosphere, and the highest quality recordings we can possibly achieve.
 
Other Ways You Can HelpAny contributions are positive and will help us progress our mission of becoming one of the top studios around, and a contribution can simply mean sharing our page around and helping spread the word. We would be extremely grateful if you'd share this Indiegogo page using the social media buttons at the top of this page.  You would be directly nurturing the realization of a dream for us!",4.0,3,"1 Campaign

<h3>Let's cut to the chase…</h3>
<p>Flying Mammals is adding More Members and is recording a New Album with a Platinum Producer in a Castle in Germany!</p>
<p>Within the last six years Flying Mammals has been around the block a few times. We have built a following from our home base in the northwest, to all over North America. Aaron, James, and Andy Birdsall started this movement to create music with their family (there are 8 siblings). We have played shows from the House Of Blues in Hollywood to The Knitting Factory in New York and music festivals from Orlando to Anchorage! However, we are about to do things that haven't happened before and things that we have been working on for years and we need support from our fans to make it all happen!</p> <p>First, we would like to officially announce that our brother Jeremy Birdsall is joining Flying Mammals! Jeremy is based out of Orlando FL, and has devoted his life to music. Jeremy has played venues and festivals with attendances of 10,000-100,000 including Universal Orlando, Walt Disney World, Hard Rock Orlando, and SunFest, and he has opened for national acts including Sammy Hagar &amp; the Circle, Huey Lewis &amp; the News, Sawyer Brown, Hunter Hayes, Scotty McCreery, and Toots &amp; the Maytals. We are so excited for the expanding of our group with Jeremy. We know that the added sounds will be closer to what is in our heads and can't wait to share them with you!</p>
<p>With that in mind… We are putting out a new album!!! This has been 3 years in the making. We are recording our next album with the world renowned Platinum Producer/Grammy Winning Engineer Sylvia Massy! Sylvia has worked with artists including: Prince, Tool, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Johnny Cash, The Black Crows, Beastie Boys and she wants to work with us! But there is more. We also are recording at Castle Rohrsdorf in Dresden Germany! This castle was built in 1599 and now is a full-fledged recording studio!</p>
<p>With the opportunity to record our next album with Sylvia at Castle Rohrsdorf in Germany and with Jeremy joining the Flying Mammals we have decided the name of our next album will be “Vier” which means the number 4 in German. This will be our 4th album, and Jeremy is the 4th Mammal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What are we talking about here...</h3>
<p>We want our fans and supporters to be apart of this next step for the Flying Mammals. The Funds needed for this album are $30,000, which would cover all of the Production Costs, Merchandise, Physical Albums, and PR/Advertising. However, the amount that we are asking for is <strong>$15,000</strong>, enough to <strong>either</strong></p>
<p>1) Cover the Production Costs and Mixing and Mastering <strong>or</strong></p>
<p>2) Cover our Airfare to Germany, Manufacturing of merchandise, and the full Release of the album.</p>
<p>As soon as we surpass our funding goal of $15,000 we will add a new incentive level featuring a Pre-Release vinyl copy of “Vier”, also including limited edition artwork.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>This Is Huge!</h3>
<p>“Vier” represents a new energy, a new lineup and a new direction for Flying Mammals! Be part of the movement. Please join us in this journey, and help us make this new sound a reality!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are going to make this album happen, it's too big of an opportunity not to! That's why we saved up the money to get to Germany and record with Sylvia and are prepared to spend all of our own money to do this! However, we love you guys and we want you to be part of this historic occasion.</p>

<h2>We Are Juan Bond and We Want Your Companionship.</h2>
<p>Hey there internet! My name is Jay Kohler and this campaign is for a metal band I started called ""Juan Bond."" This project has been many years in the making through different lineups and different musical styles that have ultimately led to where we are now. Originally started as an outlet for my own compositions, it has quickly evolved into an explosive collaborative process that I feel is really special. Check out our previous work at <a href=""https://juanbond.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://juanbond.bandcamp.com</a></p>
<h2><strong>The Campaign</strong></h2>
<p>We're raising funds to record our second EP at Backroom Studios in New Jersey. Some of you may know of Backroom for it's affiliation with Party Smasher Inc. and the Dillinger Escape Plan! Backroom has been a part of some of our favorite records and we are psyched to get in there.</p>
<p>All of your contributions go towards funding the recording, mixing, and mastering process. All of the merchandise available through this campaign will be campaign and show-exclusive; the only other way to get it is to come see us. For those of you still using physical copies of music, we have some really cool handmade packaging for our CD's available. Plus, every package includes a ""mystery"" reward. Hopefully it's something good....</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Help Us</h3>
<p>Making a professional quality record of any length is quite an expense. This is money even some very successful artists never make back with the industry the way it is. We're doing this for the love and greatly appreciate any contribution big or small. Seriously anything helps! We're a fairly new band and it can be hard getting off the ground. Plus you get some cool stuff in return. It's win-win.</p>
</div><div><h3>Even if the music isn't your thing or you're flat broke, please share this with your friends! </h3></div></div>","We Are Juan Bond and We Want Your Companionship.

Originally started as an outlet for my own compositions, it has quickly evolved into an explosive collaborative process that I feel is really special. Check out our previous work at https://juanbond.bandcamp.com
The Campaign
We're raising funds to record our second EP at Backroom Studios in New Jersey. Some of you may know of Backroom for it's affiliation with Party Smasher Inc. and the Dillinger Escape Plan! Backroom has been a part of some of our favorite records and we are psyched to get in there.
All of your contributions go towards funding the recording, mixing, and mastering process. All of the merchandise available through this campaign will be campaign and show-exclusive; the only other way to get it is to come see us. For those of you still using physical copies of music, we have some really cool handmade packaging for our CD's available. Plus, every package includes a ""mystery"" reward. Hopefully it's something good....

How You Help Us
Making a professional quality record of any length is quite an expense. This is money even some very successful artists never make back with the industry the way it is. We're doing this for the love and greatly appreciate any contribution big or small. Seriously anything helps! We're a fairly new band and it can be hard getting off the ground. Plus you get some cool stuff in return. It's win-win.
Even if the music isn't your thing or you're flat broke, please share this with your friends!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

picked up a guitar when I was 12 years old, music has been my passion. Through different
life situations, I have been unable to get it going. Recently however, I
graduated with my degree in Audio Production from the Art Institute of
Colorado. With this knowledge, I believe that it is time to bring my passion to
the forefront and bring my dream to a reality. I cannot do this alone though; I
need your help. The goal for my studio is to offer affordable recording,
mixing, mastering, editing, sound design and voice over options to all artists.
Too often an artist is handcuffed because of overpriced studio rates. My goal is
to help everyone be able to bring their passion and creativity to the world.
Not only will you be helping me achieve my dream but also those who I am able
to help realize theirs.</span></p>
<p>I am looking to raise at least $20,000, but anything over
that will definitely help. This money will go towards securing all necessary equipment
to get my studio going. This will include a new computer specifically for
recording purposes, studio furniture, studio monitors, out board gear (pre
amps, effects, control surface etc.) sound proofing materials, cables,
microphones. I already have a space to use to record for the time being until
my client base grows to where I need to rent out a space, so those costs are
not needed at this time. Just need to get the gear to make this a reality. For
perks to all of my awesome contributors I will be offering recording time
(single track/EP/LP options), studio logo t-shirts, studio logo stickers, free
entry to my band’s shows, online services for out of state clients
(mixing/mastering/editing). I decided to set this as a Flexible Funded campaign because even if I don't hit the full goal, I will still be able to help artists with what I get. </p>
<p>Music is the universal language. Music has a global reach,
but sadly there are so many artists who never get their voices heard and I want
to change that. Your next favorite artist is out there right now, working to
make their dream come true and bring their gift to everyone. If I am able to
make that happen by offering an option where they can get their music recorded
and not have to put themselves in a financial hole, I will consider it a win.</p>
<p>Everything worth doing involves risks. I understand that
finding and developing a steady client list will ultimately be what the success
of my studio hinges on. I have been playing shows and networking with artists
in the Denver scene since 2008, this will give me the base to begin my career.
Also, with being able to focus on building my studio I will have more time
available when not recording to go to local events and find clients that way as
well. I am confident that when I bring the clients in, they will leave satisfied and will tell their friends about my work.</p>
<p>I will be starting the donations at $1. I understand that
not everyone can contribute and that is completely okay. This will only be
accomplished by working together and spreading the word. Sharing the campaign
is just as valuable to me as a donation. Don’t forget to use the share tools, a
couple clicks can go a long way. </p><br/></div>","Music is my life. My name is Kevin Harrison and ever since I

I live in the foothills of the Catoctin Mountains, the easternmost ridge of the Appalachians. I went to school in the foothills of the Blue Ridge. Growing up, I was imbued with a love for the natural world, from the coastlines to the plains to the mountains. As I learned more about environmental destruction and conservation, I began to understand that nature is worth so much more than aesthetic or sentimental value. People depend on their access to clean water and clean air. Cultures depend on ecosystems. I didn’t grasp this as a kid, but it hit me with a shuddering groan as an adult. </p><p> </p><p>I responded to this realization by feeling really, really hopeless. I can recycle every can and bottle I use and bike everywhere and turn off the lights, but I still can’t regulate carbon emissions. I can’t control the price of oil. I can’t tell an economic system that it should put a monetary price on environmental destruction. I’m not a politician, or a lobbyist, or a scientist. I’m just an artist. I’m, let’s be honest, fluff. </p><p> </p><p>Right? And then I had a realization: maybe the reason we are stalled in the environmental justice area ISN’T that there aren’t enough politicians or scientists or lobbyists.

As this project grows in scope, we want to be able to increase the size of charitable donations, and donate to other groups, specifically those related to Appalachian conservancy.

<div>My name is Cameron Floyd. I am a singer/songwriter in the Charlotte area looking to share my music that I created with other musicians with all of you. </div>
<div>This music's journey starts at the point of personal failure and travels to the beautiful arena of self-forgiveness. The music here has impacted me in many ways of my life. Not just as a musician... but as a writer, friend, and christian. The process of writing this record has dragged me through truly understanding my selfish decisions, and why I made those decisions, to a place of clarity, tenacity, and forgiveness. When you let yourself and the people around you down, It is sometimes near impossible to forgive yourself. When you do the things you said you would never do. Even after many of the people I hurt forgave me, I still couldn't forgive myself. It was only through the grace of God, and I mean that, that I was able to find true forgiveness.</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>As many of you know, recording a professional album's worth of music takes plenty of creative time and of course... money... The money that is being raised through this campaign will be going to a variety of things! Here is what you will be helping fund: </div> <p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Studio Time:</b> Just renting the space and equipment is the greatest expense when it comes recording.</li>
<li>

Thank you. </div></div>","The Vision 
My name is Cameron Floyd. I am a singer/songwriter in the Charlotte area looking to share my music that I created with other musicians with all of you. 
This music's journey starts at the point of personal failure and travels to the beautiful arena of self-forgiveness. The music here has impacted me in many ways of my life. Not just as a musician... but as a writer, friend, and christian. The process of writing this record has dragged me through truly understanding my selfish decisions, and why I made those decisions, to a place of clarity, tenacity, and forgiveness. When you let yourself and the people around you down, It is sometimes near impossible to forgive yourself. When you do the things you said you would never do. Even after many of the people I hurt forgave me, I still couldn't forgive myself. It was only through the grace of God, and I mean that, that I was able to find true forgiveness.   What We Need & What You Get
As many of you know, recording a professional album's worth of music takes plenty of creative time and of course... money... The money that is being raised through this campaign will be going to a variety of things! Here is what you will be helping fund:  


Studio Time: Just renting the space and equipment is the greatest expense when it comes recording.

Design: Of course the CD has got to have great artwork! 

Packaging and Distribution: Creating physical copies of the record and distributing the project to streaming sites.

The Musicians: There are some incredible musicians working on this project, and they gotta get paid too! 

Engineering: Tracking the music is one thing, but there is a great deal of time and effort invested into the editing, mixing, and mastering processes. 

Merchandise: Don't you like Shirts, coffee mugs, stickers and stuff!?

Tour: We are in the process of planning a short but effective south-eastern tour. 

Music Videos: Who knows? If it's God's plan we raise enough money...  A video or two will be on its way! 


    Possible (But hopefully non-existent) Roadblocks We are already in the process of recording this record in all areas! However, that does not guarantee that everything is smooth sailing from here. Problems that occur could be anything from scheduling to losing audio files. If there are any speed bumps or roadblocks in this process. You all, my backers, will be the first to know.

</div></div>","Diali Cissokho & Kaira Ba are asking for your support to create
our third full-length album. We dream of producing this record both in
North Carolina and in Senegal alongside Diali’s former band. We can't do this
without your help.

           
When Kaira Ba
visited Senegal in 2011, we began forging a meaningful collaboration
with Diali's large family of griot musicians, and his former band (also called
Kaira Ba!). With this new album, we intend to make the musical connection we’ve
built between Senegal and North Carolina even stronger. Our plan is to
begin recording the album in North Carolina this summer and fall. In December
we’ll take the tracks to Senegal and do additional recording with musicians
there. Our hope is to bring our engineer, Jason Richmond, with us to make sure we are able to seamlessly integrate these two locations.Upon finishing and releasing the record we will share
proceeds from sales with the community of musicians Diali grew up alongside
in his hometown of M’Bour. This collaboration will provide a source of income
that will help these talented artists and their families have what they
need. 
             
Since our trip in 2011, Kaira Ba has attracted significant attention across West Africa for our 2014 release, the Great Peace. We were honored by a nomination for the All Africa Music Awards, often described as the
African Grammy’s, that year. The music
video for our song Mbolo (Unity) also garnered heavy TV play
across Senegal. We are heartened to see that our unique sound and message are finding
resonance both in the US and in Senegal.

                

Right now in the US, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim narratives are gaining newfound attention and validation. As a band, we believe it is important to lift up our own story of cultural trust and collaboration.  Since Diali's immigration to the US in 2010, he has impacted the lives of many people young and old with stories of pan-Africanism, Sufi Islam, and the US seen through the eyes of a recent immigrant. Through our work together, our band has built a real family, supporting one another through hard and exciting times alike.
All along the way, Kaira Ba has aimed
to create music that offers a window into possibility amidst the struggles we
all face in this world, and many of you tell us that you've experienced a deep
connection with what we've created. We hope our shows will continue to
be spaces for people to come together, celebrate and rejoice, and
be reminded that another world is possible. We believe that
music is a medicine, and we hope that you've been able to get a good dose
of it over the past six years. 
          



Kaira Ba is humbled by the support we've received from you, our community and fans, since we started this endeavor of the heart in 2010. This bold new project will enable us to refine and deepen what we have to offer you, so again we are turning to you for support. We hope you’ll help us make this ambitious dream a reality.  


Take a look at our music video for the song Mali Sadio with footage from our 2011 trip:


       What People are Saying About Kaira Ba:

""Kaira Ba has a sound that will blow you away.... at once unique and universal."" - Frank Stasio, host of The State of Things on NPR.


""Kaira Ba just might be the state's next great export.""   - Grayson Currin of Indy Week.


""The powerful vocals and kora of Diali Cissokho place this album firmly in the tradition of great Senegalese musicians such as Baaba Maal & Youssou N'Dour.""  - Merge Records owner Mac McCaughan on Kaira Ba's debut album, Resonance.


""Cissokho & Kaira Ba create a universally appealing sound full of bright tones and driving polyrhythm."" - Paste Magazine.
Here's the music video for Mbolo (Unity), played widely on TV across Senegal:

<p>Have you ever wanted to share your talents with the world? What if you never had a chance to? My late uncle and godfather Daniel Coulanges described as, ""The world's finest guitarist"" died at the young age of 28 years old on April 30th, 1989 of HIV/AIDS. At that time it was a death sentence. Today with early testing and medicine many are living and thriving with HIV/AIDS.  In Miami, One in 99 Miami-Dade residents is living with HIV or AIDS (one in 67 male and one in 178 female) source <a href=""http://www.careresource.org/hivaids/statistics/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">careresource.org</a>.

<h3>The Recording Process</h3>
<p>The songs on this record were all written within a two week period. We recorded all the basic tracking as a live band at Vinegar Hill Sound, a fantastic studio in Brooklyn. What attracted us to Vinegar Hill was the large ceilinged live room, amazing array of vintage gear and an importance of getting a really great 'room' sound. The live sessions were run and recorded by it's owner Reed Black, who helped us capture the sound and feeling of what we all knew would be the last time playing in a room together. <br/>From here on in we pretty much finished everything at our humble home studio. Added all the synths, multiple vocal tracks, extra guitars, etc and started to form and arrange the songs in some new and surprising ways. </p>
<h3>Post Production</h3>
</div><div>

<p>The next step after this is mastering, in which the album really gets polished and comes alive.

<h3>About American Sounds: World Premieres for Horn</h3>
<p>American Sounds is a collaborative project between myself, Steven Cohen, and five living American composers to create, record, and premiere five new works for French horn. Five composers, James Naigus, Jenni Brandon, Wayne Lu, Gina Gillie, and Adam Wolf, will each take part in writing a new, major work for the horn. They are a diverse group of incredibly talented composers, each with their own unique musical voice. I am honored to have the opportunity to have them be a part of this project.</p>
<p>My overall aspiration with this project is to bring about repertoire for the horn from American composers that will stand the test of time and hopefully become new standards in the horn world, standing alongside those from composers such as Mozart, Beethoven, and Hindmeith. I’ve been fortunate to have performed a fair amount of new music for horn, and many composers who write for the instrument are under appreciated or even unknown, with their marvelous compositions never performed or heard. These five composers just scratch the surface of talent in the U.S., but this project will help bring awareness to the greater world of 21st century music for the horn. To be able to help create repertoire for the 21st century from the 21st century and beyond is an unfathomable feeling. With your help, you’ll assist in the recording, production, and world premiere performances of these five works. I hope that you’ll consider being a part of this musical journey!</p>
<p>The project will create, record and premiere the following five works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sonata for Horn (2018) - James Naigus (b. 1987)</li>
<li>Sonata for Horn (2018) - Gina Gillie (b. 1981) </li>
<li>""Untitled"" for Horn, Percussion, and Piano (2018) - Adam Wolf (b. 1986)</li>
<li>""Untitled"" for Unaccompanied Horn"" (2018) - Wayne Lu (b. 1970)</li>
<li>""Untitled"" for Horn and Piano (2018) - Jenni Brandon (b. 1977)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our Budget and Available Perks</h3>
<p>The overall cost of this project including studio time, recording, editing, and mastering fees, CD production and design, fees for collaborative musicians, miscellaneous expenses, and the commission fees of the five works is well over $10,000 goal of this campaign. To give you an idea of where your support of this project would go, the breakdown of the budget is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording Studio for 3 Days: $3750</li>
<li>Mixing, Editing, and Mastering Fees: $5000</li>
<li>Recording Studio Fees: $500</li>
<li>Piano Rental: $1500</li>
<li>Piano Tuner: $500</li>
<li>CD Production and Design: $1250</li>
<li>Collaborating Musicians' Fees: $1500</li>
<li>Miscellaneous Expenses: $300</li>
<li>Travel Expenses: $700</li>
</ul>
<p>The above budget of over $15,000 does not include the commission fees of each composer, fees for rehearsal space, renting of additional equipment if need be, or any unexpected expenses. Furthermore, all fees to the composers are being paid by myself through personal funds and potentially some private support. Should this project receive more funds then are needed, we will use those funds to support musical outreach in the NY/NJ/CT area, in addition to donating to charities that support getting instruments to underserved areas.</p>
<p>In exchange for your support of this campaign, we are offering a variety of perks. From a signed copy of the CD, to an invitation to the CD's release party, and even a private concert in your home. Your support is truly appreciated and this project will not be possible without your support. </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact of American Sounds: World Premieres for Horn</strong></h3>
<p>Projects like American Sounds do not come around often, regardless of the instrument. To see a collection of works such as this under one umbrella is rare and exciting! Having the opportunity to commission these five works and see them come to fruition is an incredible feeling, but being able to introduce them to the current and future generations of horn players and music lovers is an even greater honor. </p>
<p>Within the horn community, this project will resound for years and hopefully those years will become decades that will turn into centuries. With the world premieres of these works taking place at major national and international horn events, they will reach a large reach right from the start. Furthermore, the recording will allow this project to have a truly global audience.</p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>As with any recording project, there are numerous challenges from the physical recording to the production of the CD. Thankfully for this project I am fortunate to have an incredible recording engineer, an extraordinary producer, a fantastic collaborative pianist, and two marvelous percussionists. All parties involved in American Sounds are dedicated to this project and making it come to life. The most inherent challenge is getting music from each composer by the set deadline of May 1, 2018. Things happen and the creative process cannot be rushed at times, but I know these composers to honor their agreements and create fine works of music. The planning of this project and recording have been underway for some time and we feel strongly that we will be able to bring this tremendous project to life with only a few bumps and bruises along the way.</p>

<p><br/>Berkeley Choro Ensemble made its debut at the Berkeley Public Library in January, 2010.  It has been an amazing experience to learn about and share the music of Brazil, while also attracting a growing number of fans to the music we love.  Since our beginnings, we have grown a lot and matured in our understanding and approach to playing this music.   </p>

<p><strong><i>Berkeley Choro Ensemble in 2012 with Carlos Oliveira, guitar</i></strong></p>
<p>One of our primary goals has always been to perform contemporary choros by living Brazilian composers.  Our clarinetist, Harvey Wainapel, has spent 16 years travelling to Brazil annually, staying for several months, and returning with compositions by Brazilian composers that have become part of our repertoire.  Our members Rio-born guitarist Ricardo Peixoto and  clarinetist Harvey Wainapel have also contributed to our repertoire, and five of their choros will be on this CD.  We will also record music by  Cesar Camargo Mariano, Ivanildo Maciel, Domingos Teixeira, Israel de Bueno Almeida, and Mário Sève.  In addition, we will be joined on some selections by Paul Hanson on bassoon (Mr. JazzBassoon), and Jeff Cressman (Santana Band member for 18 years) on trombone.  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492713612/g9qbymjfl7jitjw4xtop.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Berkeley Choro Ensemble has made significant contributions to building an understanding of Brazilian music in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond. Starting in 2013, percussionist Brian Rice and flutist Jane Lenoir produced three successful Festivals of Brazilian Choro at the Freight &amp; Salvage Coffeehouse in Berkeley, CA, bringing together the amazing talents of our Brazilian colleagues with our fellow American chorões.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492712285/yr75einaymyzcf0ndclq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong><i>Berkeley Choro Ensemble rehearses with guests Trio Brasileiro &amp; Edu Neves in 2015</i></strong></p>
<p>In addition, by hosting concerts throughout the past seven years, we have sponsored many world-renowned guests, including Anat Cohen, clarinet; Trio Brasileiro; Edu Neves, sax and flute; Duo Violão Brasil with Rogério Souza and Edinho Gerber on guitars; Douglas Lora, guitar;  Almir Côrtes, composer, mandolin; Nando Duarte, 7-string guitar; Vitor Gonçalves, piano; Howard Alden, guitar; Tim Connell, mandolin; Paul Hanson, bassoon; and Irene Sazer, violin.</p>
<p>The CD will help us market ourselves to a wider audience,  reach more venues and presenters, and thank our growing audience for their support over the past 7 years.  Our audience size has increased significantly over the past few years, and we feel that a CD of the music is an important part of our outreach.  Our grant of $4,000 from the SF Friends of Chamber Music will pay for our recording and commission fees, but the mixing, mastering, design and manufacturing expenses will be paid for by our funding campaign.  </p>

<h2><u>Who Are We?</u></h2>
<p>Typhon's Fall is a rock band coming out of Charleston, SC that unapologetically celebrates American Exceptionalism and right of each man and woman to be free, with unending and unwavering support of those who fight to protect it all. <br/><br/>Typhon's Fall is formed by guitarists Eric Krug (rhythm) and Brandon Jahngen (lead), with Brad Krug on bass, Mitch Broderick on drums, and Navy veteran Brendan Ferreira on lead vocals. <br/><br/>Combining modern melodic rock with heavy metal drive comes the force of Typhon's Fall. Typhon's Fall delivers energetic, unforgettable stage shows, whether it be in front of thousands or just Eric's 18-month-old, head-banging daughter (and soon to be babies from Brad and Brendan - yay!)<br/><br/>We did this because our mission to write and play music that honors liberty and the price we pay for it. We want to share our unique sound with you. The internet has made a lot of things happen, and many of those things are downright ridiculous (Cash me ousside girl? Really?).

<h3>How it started</h3>
<p>In the summer of 2014, on an impulsive moment of excitement i decided to finally go for what i have always really wanted to do and so the idea for a project was born. I made a few phone calls to some friends, also musicians and soon a lovely team was formed whose common denominator is our pure love for music. </p>
<p>For the past two years i have been presenting ""The Soul Within"" project which has made its way through several live venues in the heart of Athens.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491217923/pq10bslf92d0vd9gltey.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Recordings / Official Release</h3>
<p>On September 2016 my first single called ""The Best In Me"" was officially released. ""The Best In Me"" is a song that came to me when I felt the need to express myself even better without being afraid. When I set myself free and dived deeper into the music I wanted to make.</p>
<p>I was in collaboration with my extremely talented musicians from The Soul Within Project during the recording of the song, and I also had the pleasure to work with Sofoklis Pappas at SPR studio and Theo Gkoutsidis who arranged and co-produced the song.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is the official video by Manster Design.</p>

I made a few phone calls to some friends, also musicians and soon a lovely team was formed whose common denominator is our pure love for music. 
For the past two years i have been presenting ""The Soul Within"" project which has made its way through several live venues in the heart of Athens.
 


 
The Recordings / Official Release
On September 2016 my first single called ""The Best In Me"" was officially released. ""The Best In Me"" is a song that came to me when I felt the need to express myself even better without being afraid. When I set myself free and dived deeper into the music I wanted to make.
I was in collaboration with my extremely talented musicians from The Soul Within Project during the recording of the song, and I also had the pleasure to work with Sofoklis Pappas at SPR studio and Theo Gkoutsidis who arranged and co-produced the song.
 
Here is the official video by Manster Design.

What started out as a dream has now taken wings. Now is the perfect time for you to join me on my music journey. Head over and show me your support. Help me raise the funds to complete my EP so it can reach your ears. I’m partnering with you to make this EP happen.
 

 
A $4.000 budget can cover the expenses of:

<h3>About the show:</h3>
<p>Hi - Kait Berreckman here - I'm a songwriter, performer, teacher, and public radio nerd. When presented with the opportunity to present a weekly show at The Barley St. Tavern, the first thing I thought of was ""A Prairie Home Companion"" - Garrison Keillor's weekly variety show that has been widely broadcast on NPR since the mid 1970's.  Since Keillor recently left the program, I thought it might be fitting to pay tribute to his work with a blatant rip-off of his brainchild!</p>
<p>Barley St. is Benson's premier dive bar/music venue and is offering the show a weekly guarantee, but with over 25 amazingly talented people involved, we need your help to ensure everyone can be compensated fairly for their work. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a 21 year old film student from London and I'm passionate about writing songs, making music and filming my own videos. </p>
<p>This campaign will help me professionally create and release songs which are all about empowering people, particularly women and BME. I sing about finding pride in where you come from and what you bring to the world.</p>
<p>This album will launch my career as an artist and pave the way for me to produce music on a wider scale.</p>
<p>If you help fund my album I can afford to record in a studio, pay for the mastering of my tracks which I spend weeks creating and help me bring ideas for new music videos to life.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Studio time costs £50 a session, I have 12 songs that need to be made and each needs a separate session.</li>
<li>On top of this, mastering costs another £40 per song - without a mastering engineer my songs will not sound professional and the potential they have will suffer!</li>
<li>I try to film low-key, raw footage which isn't particularly flashy or perfect - I want my videos to have sincerity. In most cases there are still many costs to cover, including the price of props and costumes, expenses for actors, renting equipment and hiring locations/ getting permissions to film.</li>
<li>Finally, I would also love some money to promote it all and get my message out there so that people can enjoy and hopefully be inspired by what I have to say.</li>
<li>Perks for you:<ul>
<li>If you donate £10 I will give you a free digital copy of the album.</li>
<li>If you donate £20 I will post you a physical copy of the album in the post along with a signed thank you note, as well as a digital copy.</li>

<li>If you donate more than £100 you will receive all of the above and you can be in one of the music videos.</li>

<h2>ANDY NEAL album project 2017</h2>
<p>So who am I, what are these 'big plans' and why would you want to support me? First of all, I just want to say thank you for taking a moment to explore the details further, and for helping me out. Cheers ears.  <br/>This is going to be such an awesome experience to be involved in, and I'm so excited to welcome new contributors on board.</p>
<p>[Note: All contributors of any amount are invited to follow the progress of this project through regular video updates and exclusive audio previews]</p>
<h3>WHO AM I? </h3>
<p>A quick 3rd party intro for those who don't know:</p>
<p>""Andy Neal is an alternative musician from Lincolnshire UK. He has been writing honest, original music since a young teen, circa 1994. His songs and instrumental pieces hold a place in the hearts of those that have heard them, combining powerful originality with colorful insight. With a potent imagination and empathic nature, you'll find emotive chords, syncopated rhythms and poignant melodies in Andy's songs.</p>
<p>After 7 years of pushing his ideas through grunge band 'Astral Soup' he eventually went on a more solo tip. Swapping-out the rage of heavy guitars with the power of a multi-instrumental, mostly acoustic musical palette**.</p>
<p>Andy is also an accomplished self taught alt-classical guitarist, and the Spanish guitar forms the backbone of his compositions and is the tool of his busking and private gig trade.""</p>
<h3>WHAT'S THE PLAN?</h3>
<p>In most basic terms, I am making a new fully fledged studio quality album. The full reality is a lot more than that though. Although I have recorded and released a couple of albums myself in the past already, this project is special in comparison:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certain parts will be recorded live outside on-location, in a variety of natural spaces around the geographically diverse Canary Islands, which will make for magical natural effects.</li>
<li>There will be HD videos, photography and Art to accompany the music, as well as a 'Making Of' Film all as part of the multimedia album.</li>
<li>The recordings will be done mostly by me on location and at home, but with additional studio time to perfect the parts that call for it.</li>
<li>It will incorporate sounds harvested from the real world around me, both natural and industrial. I aim to Jam with the world around me, and use my imagination to the max.</li>
<li>I have upgraded my equipment especially for this project and will be acquiring still more equipment and instruments to maximize the scope of the music</li>
<li>I will be spending extended periods of time dedicated solely to producing these works, allowing an extra focus on creativity both musically and lyrically. I aim to make this the best work I can possibly create with the resources available.</li>
<li>I will be paying for professional mastering services (instead of 'in house')</li>
<li>I'm going to actually promote it properly this time! Funds willing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>WHY SUPPORT THIS?</h3>
<p>Well aside from all the perks and products you'll be getting in return for your support, I can say this music is going to be special. I'm crafting a set of music with the sole intent of making a fitting soundtrack for the world we exist in. This is going to be focused, and on-point. With vivid textures and stirring melodies reflecting various aspects of our 'home' and lives. Incorporating both natural and man made sounds from our environments alongside the chords and vocals, and with lyrics inspired by the project itself. I'm now finally at a point in my life where I can actually make something like this happen.</p>
<p>For a long time it seemed like it never could happen. I was always somewhat mired with mental and emotional problems in those earlier years of my music career, often held back by an awful anxiety disorder. I always rejected the idea of pushing for fame and fortune (and I still do). Instead I aimed for a simpler life, working any job that came along and embracing the 'working class' ethos - but whilst still keeping that musical light burning through rare private performances, recording at home and busking the streets.</p>
<p>Over recent years I've made a return to form. I've also taught myself the ropes on all kinds of digital music creation, which can now go hand in hand with my more traditional analogue background. So now, with the difficulties that held me back mostly a thing of the past, it's time for me to take all I've learnt and all that life has inspired in me, and make a f*cking great album. It may come across to some as 'cheesy' to say this, but I really want to make the best gift for the rest of the world that I can make. Why else am I even here? That's not to say I wont continue to progress and make more music in the future - but there is no time like now. You never know what is going to happen or when things are going to come crashing down.</p>
<p>This should happen now.</p>
<p>I would like to invite you to help me raise £2000 so I can complete and release my album, and in some ways, more importantly, so you can share in what I am doing.</p>
<h3>What I need AND what you will get</h3>
<p>So, what is the breakdown of my costs and what awesome incentives and products am I offering you in a trade for your help?</p>
<p>I originally budgeted £5000+ to fully complete the project and I've already put in much of it myself, but part of the nature of being self employed is that it often doesn't bring the finance you had forecast.  But this project can still happen, especially with you on board.</p>
<p>The best way that you can help, of course, is through the one thing I cant help with myself right now (at least to the degree that I need). My £2000 funding goal is a kick-start portion of the £5000 total which up until this point I have self funded, and will go towards bridging the shortfall which currently stands at closer to £3000. </p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of my key costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>£1000 Recording and monitoring equipment incl mics, headphones, audio interface, midi keyboard</li>
<li>£800 New Laptop with the specs to fit the project incl silent operation + long battery life</li>
<li>£700 Additional small musical instruments incl guitar accessories + percussion (and a cheap electric bass)</li>
<li>£500 CD duplication with digipack</li>
<li>£200 Accompanying  physical art prints </li>
<li>£100 Basic HD Video equipment</li>
<li>£1000 Studio time for isolated Vocals, fine instrumental work and final mixing.</li>
<li>£500 Mastering</li>
<li>£150 Travel expense for the multiple work locations.</li>
<li>£50 Dedicated project website fees</li>
</ul>
<p>This initial budget doesn't cover promotion after completion, expense of fulfilling album orders or the other awesome perks and products for all of you contributors. It also doesn't cover the Indiegogo or PayPal fees.</p>
<p>I have already paid for many key items on the list including specific laptop needed for the project, various recording and video equipment, audio interface, musical accessories and website costs. I'm ready to do whatever it takes to get this album made and will carry on no matter what the funding shortfall. But I just wanted to open it up to anyone who would like to support me, get some great perks out of it and simply join me on the journey of making this album reality. </p>
<p>(ANY FUNDS OVER THE GOAL WILL GO TOWARDS THE PROJECT, MORE PROMOTION, MORE STUDIO TIME, BETTER EQUIPMENT ETC. MY TALENT IS NOT LIMITED BY FINANCE BUT MY RESOURCES, SCOPE AND POTENTIAL ARE.)</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I would love for you to be a part of this journey with me and to help me extend the reach of this album beyond the usual social circles. This album is going to be original and powerful. My music has already already had a positive impact on those that have had a chance to experience it in the past, and I aim to make this my most potent work yet.</p>
<p>I hope for this music to inspire a closer connection with our environments and 'real life', and to nourish a positive outlook on our existence. I know what it's like to be in the dark grip of anxiety and depression, and this is the fruit of my fight back. I believe this project has a chance to do something great and I would humbly welcome your support.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","ANDY NEAL album project 2017
So who am I, what are these 'big plans' and why would you want to support me? First of all, I just want to say thank you for taking a moment to explore the details further, and for helping me out. Cheers ears.  This is going to be such an awesome experience to be involved in, and I'm so excited to welcome new contributors on board.
[Note: All contributors of any amount are invited to follow the progress of this project through regular video updates and exclusive audio previews]
WHO AM I? 
A quick 3rd party intro for those who don't know:
""Andy Neal is an alternative musician from Lincolnshire UK. He has been writing honest, original music since a young teen, circa 1994. His songs and instrumental pieces hold a place in the hearts of those that have heard them, combining powerful originality with colorful insight. With a potent imagination and empathic nature, you'll find emotive chords, syncopated rhythms and poignant melodies in Andy's songs.
After 7 years of pushing his ideas through grunge band 'Astral Soup' he eventually went on a more solo tip. Swapping-out the rage of heavy guitars with the power of a multi-instrumental, mostly acoustic musical palette**.
Andy is also an accomplished self taught alt-classical guitarist, and the Spanish guitar forms the backbone of his compositions and is the tool of his busking and private gig trade.""
WHAT'S THE PLAN?
In most basic terms, I am making a new fully fledged studio quality album. The full reality is a lot more than that though. Although I have recorded and released a couple of albums myself in the past already, this project is special in comparison:

Certain parts will be recorded live outside on-location, in a variety of natural spaces around the geographically diverse Canary Islands, which will make for magical natural effects.
There will be HD videos, photography and Art to accompany the music, as well as a 'Making Of' Film all as part of the multimedia album.
The recordings will be done mostly by me on location and at home, but with additional studio time to perfect the parts that call for it.
It will incorporate sounds harvested from the real world around me, both natural and industrial. I aim to Jam with the world around me, and use my imagination to the max.
I have upgraded my equipment especially for this project and will be acquiring still more equipment and instruments to maximize the scope of the music
I will be spending extended periods of time dedicated solely to producing these works, allowing an extra focus on creativity both musically and lyrically. I aim to make this the best work I can possibly create with the resources available.
I will be paying for professional mastering services (instead of 'in house')
I'm going to actually promote it properly this time! Funds willing.

WHY SUPPORT THIS?
Well aside from all the perks and products you'll be getting in return for your support, I can say this music is going to be special. I'm crafting a set of music with the sole intent of making a fitting soundtrack for the world we exist in. This is going to be focused, and on-point. With vivid textures and stirring melodies reflecting various aspects of our 'home' and lives. Incorporating both natural and man made sounds from our environments alongside the chords and vocals, and with lyrics inspired by the project itself. I'm now finally at a point in my life where I can actually make something like this happen.
For a long time it seemed like it never could happen. I was always somewhat mired with mental and emotional problems in those earlier years of my music career, often held back by an awful anxiety disorder. I always rejected the idea of pushing for fame and fortune (and I still do). Instead I aimed for a simpler life, working any job that came along and embracing the 'working class' ethos - but whilst still keeping that musical light burning through rare private performances, recording at home and busking the streets.
Over recent years I've made a return to form. I've also taught myself the ropes on all kinds of digital music creation, which can now go hand in hand with my more traditional analogue background. So now, with the difficulties that held me back mostly a thing of the past, it's time for me to take all I've learnt and all that life has inspired in me, and make a f*cking great album. It may come across to some as 'cheesy' to say this, but I really want to make the best gift for the rest of the world that I can make. Why else am I even here? That's not to say I wont continue to progress and make more music in the future - but there is no time like now. You never know what is going to happen or when things are going to come crashing down.
This should happen now.
I would like to invite you to help me raise £2000 so I can complete and release my album, and in some ways, more importantly, so you can share in what I am doing.
What I need AND what you will get
So, what is the breakdown of my costs and what awesome incentives and products am I offering you in a trade for your help?
I originally budgeted £5000+ to fully complete the project and I've already put in much of it myself, but part of the nature of being self employed is that it often doesn't bring the finance you had forecast.  But this project can still happen, especially with you on board.
The best way that you can help, of course, is through the one thing I cant help with myself right now (at least to the degree that I need). My £2000 funding goal is a kick-start portion of the £5000 total which up until this point I have self funded, and will go towards bridging the shortfall which currently stands at closer to £3000. 
Here's a breakdown of my key costs:

£1000 Recording and monitoring equipment incl mics, headphones, audio interface, midi keyboard
£800 New Laptop with the specs to fit the project incl silent operation + long battery life
£700 Additional small musical instruments incl guitar accessories + percussion (and a cheap electric bass)
£500 CD duplication with digipack
£200 Accompanying  physical art prints 
£100 Basic HD Video equipment
£1000 Studio time for isolated Vocals, fine instrumental work and final mixing.
£500 Mastering
£150 Travel expense for the multiple work locations.
£50 Dedicated project website fees

This initial budget doesn't cover promotion after completion, expense of fulfilling album orders or the other awesome perks and products for all of you contributors. It also doesn't cover the Indiegogo or PayPal fees.
I have already paid for many key items on the list including specific laptop needed for the project, various recording and video equipment, audio interface, musical accessories and website costs. I'm ready to do whatever it takes to get this album made and will carry on no matter what the funding shortfall. But I just wanted to open it up to anyone who would like to support me, get some great perks out of it and simply join me on the journey of making this album reality. 
(ANY FUNDS OVER THE GOAL WILL GO TOWARDS THE PROJECT, MORE PROMOTION, MORE STUDIO TIME, BETTER EQUIPMENT ETC. MY TALENT IS NOT LIMITED BY FINANCE BUT MY RESOURCES, SCOPE AND POTENTIAL ARE.)

<h3><strong>Meshi biography</strong></h3>
<p><u>About the artist</u></p>
<p>Majda Maria Guessous is a <strong>Hungarian-Moroccan</strong> singer performing in ten languages who graduated at the <strong>Liszt Academy for Music</strong> as a folk song performer and teacher. Currently, she is an assistant professor of the Academy and an active artist of the <strong>MUS-E (Musique-Europe)</strong> program during which she holds art therapy sessions for disadvantaged children. Furthermore, she performs numerous concerts in Hungary as well as abroad. Born in Hungary, Majda Maria Guessous has always been concerned with the issue of living her double identity as an ‘organic unit’. As an adult, this endeavor has opened a door for her beyond Hungarian folk music to profound interpretations of seemingly distant Oriental cultures. As a singer and songwriter, her playful creative process stems from <strong>Hungarian, Turkish, Moroccan and Indian </strong>traditions. She is particularly sensitive towards underprivileged people.     </p>
<p><strong>BIOGRAPHY </strong></p>
<p><i>„Through music, I would like to become a bridge between different people and different cultures.” </i>- Meshi</p>
<p>During the years 2015 and 2017, she had numerous performances throughout the world in the <strong>USA, Turkey, Morocco, India, Kazakhstan, France, Bahrein, Azerbaijan and Kuwait.</strong> In 2017 she was the first Hungarian singer performing in <strong>Riyadh, Saudi Arabia</strong>. In 2016, besides publishing her third album <strong><i>Bosporus Overflowing</i></strong>, she released her first self-written song <strong><i>Metamorphosis</i></strong> that launched this new project.</p>
<p><strong>Majda Mária Guessous </strong>is preparing special performances for different stages where the audience can witness many formations of hers melting into each other. For example, the repertoire of the <strong>Meshi Guessous Trio</strong> is based on mostly Hungarian, Turkish and Moroccan folk songs, while <strong>Meshinda  Band </strong>performs mostly Indian music.</p>
<p>In 2009, Meshi spent a semester in Istanbul, <strong>Turkey </strong>at the University of Mimar Sinan with Erasmus scholarship. She improved her musical knowledge and her instrumental skills at the <strong>Saz School of Erdal Erzincan </strong>as a student of the wife of Erdal, <strong>Mercan Erzincan</strong>. This journey was the inspiration for her first album <strong><i>Rainbow Bridge</i></strong> which is an encounter of <strong>Hungarian, Turkish and Moroccan folk songs </strong>at the great turning points of human life. She was also inspired by learning Moroccan music from her Moroccan singer master <strong>Abderrahim Amrani</strong>.</p>
<p>Meshi has been credited with several successes both nationally and internationally. She performed at <strong>famous festivals</strong>, for example <strong>in Morocco at the <i>Festival de Fès des musiques sacrées du monde</i></strong>, in India at the IIT Rendezvous Festival Delhi,  the Delhi International Arts Festival, the Mysore Dasara Festival and in Spain at the Festival Internacional de Música y Danza de Granada | FEX.</p>
<p>She had the chance to work together with several great musicians in the fields of folk, world and jazz music at home and also abroad, including <strong>Abderrahim Amrani (MR)</strong>, Trilok Gurtu (IN), Mike Stern (USA), Tamás Kobzos Kiss (HU), <strong>Marouan Benabdallah (HU-MR), </strong>Yusuf Benli (TR), Károly Binder (HU), Dimitri Grechi Espinoza (IT-RU), Erdal Şalikoğlu (AT-TR), Fausto Beccalossi (IT), James Brock (USA), <strong>Said Tichiti (HU-MR)</strong>, Szabolcs Szőke (HU), Balázs Vizeli (HU), <strong>Yanis Benabdallah (HU-MR), </strong>Ákos Kertész (HU), István Pál Szalonna and his band (HU), Rajeev Janardan (IN), Rajesh Gangani (IN) and Csaba Tóth-Bagi, Balkan Union (HU).</p>

Meshi biography
About the artist
Majda Maria Guessous is a Hungarian-Moroccan singer performing in ten languages who graduated at the Liszt Academy for Music as a folk song performer and teacher. Currently, she is an assistant professor of the Academy and an active artist of the MUS-E (Musique-Europe) program during which she holds art therapy sessions for disadvantaged children. Furthermore, she performs numerous concerts in Hungary as well as abroad. Born in Hungary, Majda Maria Guessous has always been concerned with the issue of living her double identity as an ‘organic unit’. As an adult, this endeavor has opened a door for her beyond Hungarian folk music to profound interpretations of seemingly distant Oriental cultures. As a singer and songwriter, her playful creative process stems from Hungarian, Turkish, Moroccan and Indian traditions. She is particularly sensitive towards underprivileged people.     
BIOGRAPHY 
„Through music, I would like to become a bridge between different people and different cultures.” - Meshi
During the years 2015 and 2017, she had numerous performances throughout the world in the USA, Turkey, Morocco, India, Kazakhstan, France, Bahrein, Azerbaijan and Kuwait. In 2017 she was the first Hungarian singer performing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In 2016, besides publishing her third album Bosporus Overflowing, she released her first self-written song Metamorphosis that launched this new project.
Majda Mária Guessous is preparing special performances for different stages where the audience can witness many formations of hers melting into each other. For example, the repertoire of the Meshi Guessous Trio is based on mostly Hungarian, Turkish and Moroccan folk songs, while Meshinda  Band performs mostly Indian music.
In 2009, Meshi spent a semester in Istanbul, Turkey at the University of Mimar Sinan with Erasmus scholarship. She improved her musical knowledge and her instrumental skills at the Saz School of Erdal Erzincan as a student of the wife of Erdal, Mercan Erzincan. This journey was the inspiration for her first album Rainbow Bridge which is an encounter of Hungarian, Turkish and Moroccan folk songs at the great turning points of human life. She was also inspired by learning Moroccan music from her Moroccan singer master Abderrahim Amrani.
Meshi has been credited with several successes both nationally and internationally. She performed at famous festivals, for example in Morocco at the Festival de Fès des musiques sacrées du monde, in India at the IIT Rendezvous Festival Delhi,  the Delhi International Arts Festival, the Mysore Dasara Festival and in Spain at the Festival Internacional de Música y Danza de Granada | FEX.
She had the chance to work together with several great musicians in the fields of folk, world and jazz music at home and also abroad, including Abderrahim Amrani (MR), Trilok Gurtu (IN), Mike Stern (USA), Tamás Kobzos Kiss (HU), Marouan Benabdallah (HU-MR), Yusuf Benli (TR), Károly Binder (HU), Dimitri Grechi Espinoza (IT-RU), Erdal Şalikoğlu (AT-TR), Fausto Beccalossi (IT), James Brock (USA), Said Tichiti (HU-MR), Szabolcs Szőke (HU), Balázs Vizeli (HU), Yanis Benabdallah (HU-MR), Ákos Kertész (HU), István Pál Szalonna and his band (HU), Rajeev Janardan (IN), Rajesh Gangani (IN) and Csaba Tóth-Bagi, Balkan Union (HU).

<h3>Zenden Lavon's New Album!!</h3>
<p>Hey Everyone!</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by my little campaign!</p>
<p>I've been singing and making music since I was 9 years old and recently I've really been making my musical dreams a reality. I've always wanted to make a TRULY Jazz influenced Hip Hop album that spoke to people and made them feel something. I've attempted at making this album many times but never had the correct skills or resources to do so. Despite my failures I've always been working behind the scenes to finally make this album a reality by collecting ideas for concepts, structuring certain melodies, and selecting certain artists, producers, and musicians to help with the project. Finally I think I'm ready to execute this album.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To get this record done I need to cover the costs of the collaborations with musicians and producers for the music itself and also the mixing and mastering. Once it is done the album will be available for digital download and streaming on all major musical platforms.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to raise $6,500 to cover the cost of the musical collaborations, mixing and mastering. Anything that you guys can donate would be an amazing help to get this project out there to the world.</p>
<p>And not to worry, your help will not go unnoticed. Donating will give you certain perks and limited edition bundles such as signed vinyl records and/or a mixtape with all of the songs that don't make the album and cool merchandise !</p>
</div>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I feel that Hip Hop needs more conscious and progress Hip Hop that challenges the thoughts of listeners while still giving them something to groove to, and that is what I strive to achieve. I value the sound of old school Hip Hop and Funk and want to pay homage to the greats that came before me through this album. I plan on creating an album that you can relate to and use as a tool to vent emotions of all kinds.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main risk with this process is the release date. I hope to have this released by some time in November of 2017 but of course there is no guarantee. All of the perks for donations will depend on the progress of the campaign and thus impacting the release of the album. However with your help I can get this album out on time along with all of your perks! :)</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>If you can't donate then there are other ways that you could help me out! Sharing the link with your friends and family and just spreading the word can do wonders. Getting the word out is just as good as donating in my eyes so feel free to share my campaign if you can't donate!! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you so much all of you!</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>My name is Donovan Raitt, and I play acoustic fingerstyle guitar music. I have released two albums of my original music and I'm excited to announce that I'll be recoding a third Original album this spring! I'm really excited about this new music, but I need your help to make it all happen! You contribution to this campaign will help me cover recording and production expenses and you’ll get some great perks as a thank you for your support. This album is some of my best music yet, and I promise you will love the new music! I can't wait to share it with you all! </p>
<p><u><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></u></p>
<p>So here's the important stuff! I'll be recording this album in late March with Antoine Dufour, who produced my last record and is one of the best producers of acoustic guitar music around. Antoine and I have performed together several times and we have recorded together before on my 2014 album ""Pursuing the Horizon"" and I can't wait to work with him again on this new music. </p>
<p>Your contribution to this campaign will help cover recording and travel expenses, as well as the artwork creation and the actual costs involved with releasing a CD including mixing, mastering and CD duplication.</p>
<p>We have some great perks for you as a supporter, from CD's and Digital Downloads of the new album, to guitar tabs, my entire back catalogue, one of my personal guitars, and if we reach our full goal, I will be able to press the album on 180 gram clear Vinyl! I will also be announcing some partnerships with some of my sponsors to give away some very cool perks for you guitar players out there!</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for helping with this campaign, wether you decide to contribute or can just help by spreading the word and telling your friends and their friends, It means the world to me! <br/><br/><u><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></u></p>
<p>With any creative project, there are definitely risks and challenges involved. Thankfully, there are very few with this project. </p>

<p>All of the songs are just about complete, and a few just need some minor touches here and there, so the music is ready to go, and the studio dates are already booked! </p>
<p>The only prohibiting factor in making this project a reality is having enough funding to make this album happen. Otherwise we’re good to go!</p>
<p>THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP AND SUPPORT!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Vivian Garcia. I am a Chicago based Latina musician  who  has been gigging professionally  since 1999. In that time, besides performing at venues and festivals  all over Chicago (Taste of Chicago, Navy Pier,Martyrs,Double Door,Metro, Thalia Hall, Subterranean, Portage Theater,Township, Uncommon Ground ,Music Without Borders Lunchtime  Series 2007-2011, Chicago World Music Festival,  Fiesta del Sol, Clark Street Music,  Festival, Villapalooza, Pilsen Fest) I have lived and performed in Southwest Florida as well as Madrid, Spain. During my years abroad, I had the opportunity to produce and record my debut album of original music in 2012 called Cold Bed, a project that put me on the map locally as a singer songwriter which eventually led to opportunities such as opening twice for Grammy winning act La Santa Cecilia, as well other well known performers such as Los Amigos Invisibles, and Centavrvs. </li>
<li>In 2016, with the help of friends and family and  I released an EP, In Between Times. This project  allowed for me to show ways that I had grown musically as a performer and songwriter. It was the first time I had self released bilingual music. I believe having had it professionally recorded by Andy Shoemaker at Rax Trax studios is what took it to the next level and created a pathway for  the song Ven Conmigo to be found and featured on a HULU show.  </li>
<li> This past year I have been working two musicians, Edwin Martinez on trumpet and Bill Garcia on the cajón, performing as a trio.

My name is Vivian Garcia. I am a Chicago based Latina musician  who  has been gigging professionally  since 1999. In that time, besides performing at venues and festivals  all over Chicago (Taste of Chicago, Navy Pier,Martyrs,Double Door,Metro, Thalia Hall, Subterranean, Portage Theater,Township, Uncommon Ground ,Music Without Borders Lunchtime  Series 2007-2011, Chicago World Music Festival,  Fiesta del Sol, Clark Street Music,  Festival, Villapalooza, Pilsen Fest) I have lived and performed in Southwest Florida as well as Madrid, Spain. During my years abroad, I had the opportunity to produce and record my debut album of original music in 2012 called Cold Bed, a project that put me on the map locally as a singer songwriter which eventually led to opportunities such as opening twice for Grammy winning act La Santa Cecilia, as well other well known performers such as Los Amigos Invisibles, and Centavrvs. 
In 2016, with the help of friends and family and  I released an EP, In Between Times. This project  allowed for me to show ways that I had grown musically as a performer and songwriter. It was the first time I had self released bilingual music. I believe having had it professionally recorded by Andy Shoemaker at Rax Trax studios is what took it to the next level and created a pathway for  the song Ven Conmigo to be found and featured on a HULU show.  
 This past year I have been working two musicians, Edwin Martinez on trumpet and Bill Garcia on the cajón, performing as a trio. It has created a space for me to explore even further musically in live settings and rehearsals and has inspired me to create a whole new group of songs for a new EP entitled Fly, Mariposa ( fly butterfly- a play on my stage name and my bicultural experience) that match this new epoch of my life and writing style. I am eager to share these pieces with more than those who are able to see me live. 
What is the purpose of this campaign?This is a campaign to raise funds to get back into a professional studio and also professionally and press CDs using CD Baby who assist with national and international distribution.

<h3>
<br/><strong>Why another album?</strong><br/> </h3>
<p><strong>I've continued to write songs as I've pursued a career as a touring Jewish artist- and educator-in-residence.</strong> I feel I still have something to say -- about the rapidly changing landscape of both Jewish and American life in the here and now, the impermanence of life, and the legacy we'll leave to the next generation.<br/>And I want to say it from where and how I live.<br/>Different perspectives can teach us something about the greater whole and empower us to act for that greater good, for all of us.</p>
</div><div>
<p>I want to record my songs and share them with you.</p>
<p>To that end, I have decided to do a few things differently this time:<br/><br/>-- <strong>I'm recording my songs in as stripped-down a way as possible.</strong> There will be no one else playing or singing on this collection except me. I want the lyrics and melodies to shine through. I want the music to be real, raw, and immediate. And I don't care about ""competing"" with more slickly-produced collections out there in the musical universe. Nor do I care about licensing my music for some car commercial. My life is not a competition. Neither is my music.<br/>-- <strong>I will record and distribute this collection as simply and affordably as possible.</strong> The final price of the recording will reflect the true cost of production, and hopefully make my music accessible to more people.<br/>-- <strong>I will make NO physical CDs this time for environmental reasons. </strong>Fewer companies are offering duplication services and many more artists are offering their music exclusively online. The amount of plastic involved in creating and packaging a CD is crazy. I won't contribute to putting more of it out into the world.<br/><strong>-- I will make digital download cards available for my campaign supporters, and for purchase at live shows.</strong>  Anyone who wants a recording of this album will be able to access it as a digital download through multiple online sources. The download cards will be printed on recycled paper, and will be recyclable. (They also make excellent bookmarks.)<br/>-- <strong>There will be no physical perks sent out in the mail.</strong> Everything I offer will be available electronically to save time, money, and resources.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Not everyone will appreciate my approach to Judaism, or to producing recorded music.</h3>
<p>Oh, well.<br/>Life is short, resources are shrinking, there are so many challenges to the planet and to the human race. The very idea that anyone can dare to try and earn even some part of their living as a musician may seem almost ridiculous -- especially to non-musicians. But it's what I do. It's in my DNA (Thanks, Mom and Dad!). It's how I move through the world and it's what I put out into the world with all the love and passion I can muster.<br/>So if my creative philosophy pushes back against the current standards of cost and glitz, that's simply an extension of my class-busting, egalitarian approach to just about everything in my life. And I stand by that with equal measures of humility, pride and gratitude.</p>
<p>Assuming I can raise enough money, I plan to record my collection at <a href=""http://www.themaproomstudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Map Room Studio</a> in Fall 2019. Mixing and mastering will follow shortly after that, and I anticipate a December 2019 release - just in time for my music to be a Chanukah gift to the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Of course, stuff happens. This is real life. There may be delays.</h3>
<p>Health issues, family stuff and technical glitches can delay any part of the production process.<br/>If something like that happens this time around, I will of course let you know through regular updates, and keep you in the loop. And I'll be grateful for your patience and understanding.</p>

<p>Whether it's a four-song EP or a full-length album, something will come of this effort. I write songs because I have to, because if I don't then the stuff inside me will implode.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Ecuador's unique mosaic of habitats within, East and West of the Andes make it one of the most species rich regions on planet Earth. To give you some idea: approximately 20% of all the known 20,000 butterfly species can be found somewhere in Ecuador. And that's just the butterflies....</p>
<p>Each album sold includes a £5.00 donation to World Land Trust (WLT), who will use the money to help their conservation partners in Ecuador expand wildlife reserves in one of the most biodiversity rich regions on our planet, including Nangaritza Reserve in Southern Ecuador, where Nature and Culture International are establishing a protected forest corridor between the Andes mountains and Amazon lowlands, with protected areas for its indigenous Shuar communities. The more successful is this album, the larger the area of forest we safeguard for generations to come.</p>
<p>By the end of this initial phase of the project we will have raised a minimum of £5000. Once we've met our target the album will be more widely distributed, raising more funds for World Land Trust's forest conservation work in Ecuador.</p>

Ecuador's unique mosaic of habitats within, East and West of the Andes make it one of the most species rich regions on planet Earth. To give you some idea: approximately 20% of all the known 20,000 butterfly species can be found somewhere in Ecuador. And that's just the butterflies....
Each album sold includes a £5.00 donation to World Land Trust (WLT), who will use the money to help their conservation partners in Ecuador expand wildlife reserves in one of the most biodiversity rich regions on our planet, including Nangaritza Reserve in Southern Ecuador, where Nature and Culture International are establishing a protected forest corridor between the Andes mountains and Amazon lowlands, with protected areas for its indigenous Shuar communities. The more successful is this album, the larger the area of forest we safeguard for generations to come.
By the end of this initial phase of the project we will have raised a minimum of £5000. Once we've met our target the album will be more widely distributed, raising more funds for World Land Trust's forest conservation work in Ecuador.


Risks & Challenges
The book design is complete, our printer and CD manufacturer lined up and ready to go. All we need is your order. The book is printed at high quality, so we need a minimum of 1000 pre-orders to manufacture it at a sensible price. It's as simple as that.

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What is going on!?</span></h3>
<p>I've spent the past year and a half honing what I sound like as a solo artist. The stories I tell are my own and yet, I believe they are also yours. I've always inserted myself into songs and delivered others' stories as myself. Deeply personal with whimsical melody, this album is the product of introspection and spontaneous creation into what I have to say. I love communicating with people (I hate small talk!) and I've found there can be a universal experience in every situation. I hope that parts of you feel reflected in these songs.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of some of my favorites: The Bird and the Bee, Aimee Mann, Joni Mitchell, and Jenny O (to name a few), I'm working with Sam Kassirer to simply and honestly deliver fun, melodic, layered vocals and catchy instrumentals. You'll hear the softer side of what you've experienced from me in other collaborations, and a more personal and deeper connection than <i>Hush Now: Lullabies for Sleepy People</i>.  There's a pop sensibility with a folk education to my music, and since I'm a Pisces, <i>everything</i> is feelings. </p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Hi, this is Brian Tom O'Connor, and I'll be returning to the cabaret stage with a solo show, ""The Zen of Show Tunes,"" and I need your help to make it happen.</p>
<h3><strong>The Quick Pitch</strong></h3>
<p>I'm the co-creator of three hit ""O'Connor &amp; Vogel"" cabaret shows with Debra Vogel – ""Guy &amp; Doll,"" ""How to be Perfect,"" and ""Found &amp; Lost.""

<p>I'll be bringing that same blend of reimagined musical comedy and heartfelt song to my solo show.</p>
<h3><strong>What's ""The Zen of Show Tunes""?</strong></h3>
<p>""The Zen of Show Tunes"" is a cabaret romp through my favorite musical theater songs, some familiar, some rare, and ranges from the tongue-in-cheek and the silly, through the dark emotions that challenge us all, and out again into the sunlight of theater music that make life worth living. I think of it as ""How Show Tunes Saved My Life.""</p>
<p>I'm also a teacher of my own brand of playful meditation practices called Awareness Games, the author of <i>Awareness Games: Playing with Your Mind to Create Joy,</i> and the co-host of the podcast, ""Awareness Explorers.""

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey everybody, we are Gabe (vocals/bass), Jake (guitar), and PJ (drums), and together, we are Lochaven. Lochaven is a hard-rock power trio that was formed in December of 2017 in Clarkston, MI, but our story goes back much further than that.</p>
<p>Gabe and PJ began playing music together back in the summer of 2014 in a group called Teenage Wasteland. Teenage Wasteland was a Waterford-based rock band that played well over a dozen shows in the Metro Detroit area over the course of two years, before disbanding in the Spring of 2016.</p>
<p>Towards the end of Wasteland's run, Jake joined the band as its second guitarist, and although the band never played a show with him in the line-up, his fusion into the group served as the fertile ground from which Lochaven would grow. In the Summer of 2016, just a couple months after Teenage Wasteland was disbanded, the boys got together again for a new project: Sleeper Pick. Although the trio only played a couple of shows together before the group disbanded in December of 2016, the story doesn't end there.</p>
<p>One year later, with new songs and a new direction, the group was reborn as Lochaven. Lochaven grinded away in the basement and in the garage throughout the Winter and Spring of 2018, playing our first public gig in August of that year. Since then, we've played more than a dozen shows in just over half of a year, and in that time, we have also released two singles, “The Promised Land” and “Now or Never,” with the latter also serving as our debut music video. And now, our sights are set on something even bigger: a full-length album. This album, which features songs conceived from as far back as the pre-Teenage Wasteland days, has been five years in the making, and the time to make it is now.</p>
<p>So how do you fit into all of this? Well, there is much that goes into the production of a song beyond just simply recording the parts in the studio. Once the parts are recorded, they go through a mixing and mastering process. It is through this process that a song comes together and its strongest elements are made to truly pop. For instance, fans of “Now or Never” have the mixing and mastering process to thank for its slick production value. However, the creation of quality, recorded music requires a lot of time and money, and we’re reaching out to request your support to help make this dream a reality.</p>
<p>Your contributions to the recording of this album will go a long way in helping us to create the best album possible. Regardless of the outcome of this campaign, we are going to record this album. The difference you make, however, is that you will help us avoid cutting corners in creating this album, and you will ensure that it is made in the way that we intend: for the people.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our flexible goal for this campaign is $7,000. This $7,000 will be used as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5,200 for recording, mixing, and mastering</li>
<li>$1,200 for manufacturing and distribution</li>
<li>$600 for miscellaneous costs including commissioning album artwork/design, copyright filings, promotional materials, and unforeseen costs</li>
</ul>
<p>Like we said, whether we reach our goal or not, we're going to make this album. However, it would be ideal to raise as much money as possible so that we don't have to cut corners, and we can make the best album that we are able to. If we are able to raise all $7,000, the above list describes where the money will go. If we are unable to reach our goal, however, then the money will be allocated in the order listed.</p>
<p>So what do you get out of donating, aside from the warm feeling of helping someone achieve their dreams? Well, we've got a nice set of perks laid out for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>$10 will get you a first edition copy of our CD, signed by all three of us</li>
<li>$20 will get you the aforementioned perk, as well as a video where we tell the inspiration behind the song of your choosing, as well as any interesting stories behind the creation/recording of that song</li>
<li>$50 will get you all the above, as well as having your name mentioned in the thank-you portion of the album credits (we will thank all of our Indiegogo supporters, but if you want to be personally singled out, this perk is for you)</li>
<li>$100 will get you all the above, as well as a home video of a condensed, acoustic version of the cover song of your choosing</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Say you're unable to contribute monetarily, but you still want to help. Or, say you have contributed to our crowdfund, but you still want to help in other ways. Well, all we ask is that you spread the word. Please, tell your friends, tell your enemies, tell your cat. Whoever you tell, let them know what we are trying to accomplish. The more that people know, the more we will raise, and the better our album will be. Thank you.</div></div>","Short Summary

Despite a life full of challenges and turmoil, Ryan “Gooch” Nelson provides music that speaks to the soul and delivers hope and happiness through your speakers. This full time musician is also an activist and has created the Music in Motion Foundation bringing music education, scholarships, and music therapy to those in need. The band is a cohesive group of musicians, singers, and songwriters who come together to create their unique sound labeled as ""The Motion.""
This campaign is for funding Gooch and The Motion's second album. 
Contributors will help the band achieve funds for production, studio time, and the many other costs involved to create an album. 


What We Need & What You Get

With the hopes of raising $10,000 the funds will specifically go to recording fees, mixing and mastering, PR, album artwork, photography, touring, and distribution.

Our unique and exciting perks include band merchandise such as t-shirts, cds, digital downloads, performances, and more!
Even if the desired goal is not reached, any amount helps for recording fees and more. The money will go to the categories listed above. 


The Impact

This project is so valuable to Gooch and The Motion to be able to continue their love of music, grow as artists and musicians, and to be able to share it with their strong fanbase.
The band has shared their music on the same stage with The Allman Brothers, Luther Dickinson, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Robert Randolph and the Family Band, Walter Trout, and the Zach Brown Band, just to name a few. 
The band has had success with their first Indiegogo campaign which raised funds for the first album ""Comin' Home."" It has helped them have a successful career headlining for shows and to be able to build lasting relationships with fans.

<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>Hello! We are the High Desert Duo, a tuba/horn duet that seeks to push the envelope and create a performance that is high energy and engaging for all audiences. Our goal is to expand the tuba/horn duet repertoire by exploring new musical styles and incorporating technological elements to give players the option to enhance their recital performances with a modern and unique twist. </p>
</div><div>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Consortium</span></h3>
<p>While hunting for music for tuba and horn we had trouble finding any music to play that we truly believed in and wanted to share with our audiences. We also wanted program something larger than just music for horn and tuba. </p>
<p>So we did something about it.</p>
<p>We sat down and created a list of goals for our duet. First on the list is to create new music and expand the repertoire. Through this, we are able to support our friends and fellow artists. We also want to create a unique and engaging concert experience for our audiences. Nobody really cares about music for horn and tuba except for other horn and tuba players (and maybe their moms), and we want to change that. We want to showcase music that has the potential to engage a wide ranging audience everywhere from the recital hall to an open mic night at a smokey bar. We were then confronted with the fact that in order to have such flexibility in reaching nontraditional audiences we had to be creative about the accompaniment for the piece (surprisingly not every smokey bar has a functional piano in it).</p>
<p>We have commissioned two new exciting pieces for horn, tuba, and recorded accompaniment that are accessible to performers and audiences alike! The first piece by Micah Hood out of Albuquerque, NM is based around a 2-3 clave rhythm and incorporates Latin percussion and elements of salsa music in a fun and modern tonality that is guaranteed to get your body moving! The second piece by Cory Murray out of Lafayette, LA takes us down to the streets of New Orleans and has that funky flavor that is sure to get even the stuffiest of audiences out of their seats!</p>

<p>Micah Hood (M. J. Hood) is a trombonist and composer/arranger who resides in Albuquerque, New Mexico. A native of north Texas, he received his Bachelor’s degree from Texas Tech University in music performance and his Master’s degree from the University of New Mexico in music performance and theory/composition, respectively.  As a composer, Micah’s scope and experience is richly diverse, incorporating elements of jazz, latin, electronica, experimentalism, and visual art in his scores. He has not only written and arranged music for various media like podcasts, movies, video games, and websites, but has also written and arranged music for many soloists, chamber groups, congregations, and New Mexico-based musical groups, including Dynette Marie, Ariel Macias, Dogbone Trio, Pentet, Banda Atómica, and Baracutanga.  Micah has written electronic music since he was thirteen, and is an artist under the Oddeo Netwerx music label. In his art music, he composes experimental graphical art music scores that promote the marrying of visual art with musical arts, creating a visual-musical and interpretive poetry called asemicism. Micah currently manages the MAST Project music technology lab at the University of New Mexico and teaches music theory and general music courses at Santa Fe Community College and Central New Mexico Community College.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Contributing to this campaign will help me and the company fulfill its purpose and reach the world.

<p>Hey y'all!!!</p>
<p>I am a Nigerian-American artist finishing up my degree in Drama at NYU. I love music, dance, film, performance, art, reality tv and most recently Skinny Popcorn. When I’m not watching Judge Faith on YouTube, I'm writing songs and creating. I'm passionate about a lot things but I want to tell you about the project that has my heart at the moment. Her name is KOLO.</p>
<p>Kolo was created because someone that I love encouraged me to write it. Its about love, acceptance, passion and how all of those things transcend one’s aesthetic. I think it's important to have people around you that encourage you to be 100% yourself. So what started off as an idea is now a full blown student-run production. The team we have put together is beyond special and has so so so much faith in our work. Thank you so much for helping out! I can't wait for you to see the final product. August 7, 2019. </p>

My father was a devout fan of classical music and it played daily on the family phonograph. This early exposure to concert music and the presence of highly competent music teachers instilled a love of music that later turned into a life-long passion. The music of Karel Husa, Bela Bartok, Hindemith, Miles Davis, Chick Corea and Ralph Towner were all key influences in my early musical development. A professional performer on both oboe and saxophone, I have a deep background in both jazz and classical music and have led my own groups and worked as a studio musician for over thirty years. I studied oboe at the University of South Florida and the University of Wisconsin, Platteville. After years of performing professionally as a jazz artist, I decided to return to my classical roots and received a master’s degree in composition at the University of Southern Maine in Portland, where I studied with composers Elliott Schwartz and Dan Sonenberg.</p><p>I have written hundreds of jazz compositions, two woodwind quintets, a string quartet, four works for chamber orchestra, a brass quintet, a trio for clarinet, viola and piano, a symphony for winds and percussion, a trio for flute, clarinet, bassoon and piano based on native American folk songs, and a trio for woodwinds, among others. 2011 saw the international release of my solo jazz album, “Bamboo Philharmonic,” on Blue Bamboo Music. I also composed a large work for symphony orchestra, “Songs from the Gulf of Sorrows,” premiered by the Brevard Symphony Orchestra in 2016. I am now a freelance composer and arranger based in central Florida, and perform with my progressive jazz group, Strange Angels.</p><p>“Wind Talkers” represents a collection of contemporary chamber works for woodwinds which I composed from 2009 to 2019. It is a sort of musical travelogue depicting many of the beautiful and historic locations that I was privileged to call home over the last twenty-five years, including Seattle, Southwest Wisconsin, Maine, Peterborough, NH, Columbus, OH, Winston-Salem, NC, and Winter Park, FL. It also includes movements dedicated to the late Sam Rivers and my dear friend and mentor, the composer Elliott Schwartz.</p><p><strong><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/mark-piszczek/mov-i-blue-springs-eternal-from-nubanusit-dreams-for-flute-and-piano"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Listen to an excerpt here of Blue Springs Eternal from Monadnock Dreams</a> for flute and piano</strong></p><p>This challenging program can only be realized by musicians of the highest level of professionalism. Your contribution will enable me to offset the key expenses involved in presenting a concert of this caliber. Traditionally, one of the major challenges in presenting original music is lack of sufficient rehearsal time. A concert such as this requires seasoned professional musicians and compensation must include rehearsal time. Even for professionals, learning new music is incredibly demanding and requires more rehearsal hours than the established repertoire— in short, the more rehearsals, the better the performance! Your contribution will directly enable me to ensure the music receives adequate rehearsal and the musicians are compensated for their time. Based on my budget, the campaign goal of $2500 ensures that these needs will be met. I will also be giving a portion of the funds raised to the <strong><a href=""https://timucua.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Timucua Arts Foundation</a> </strong>and the <strong><a href=""https://cfcomposers.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Central Florida Composers Forum</a></strong>.</p><p>Please share the campaign to help get the word out -- any and all contributions are greatly appreciated! If you’re in the central Florida area, mark your calendars. “Wind Talkers” will be free and open to the public (suggested donation at door).

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>(Za BHS prevod molim vas pogledajte ispod) </p>
<p>I'm Vojislav Ivanovic, composer and guitarist. My anniversary concert is intended to summarize a lifetime of achievement in music as a performer and a composer. Guest artists in this concert are most distinguished soloists from 5 countries and very important feature of this concert is introduction of the newly formed Sarajevo Youth Chamber Orchestra which will make its debut appearance. This concert to be held in Sarajevo, my birthplace where I made first steps in music is very important to me as it sums up my 40 years of engagement in music. The concert will also give an opportunity to the audience to hear all this music and to the backers to have quality audio and video recording of it, thus making it available to the much wider audience.</p>
<p>About me and my work find out more on:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.vojislavivanovic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.vojislavivanovic.com</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Making of a Concert</strong></h3>
<p>This very special gala anniversary concert will take place on November 2nd 2019 starting at 20.00 pm at the Grand Hall of the Armed Forces of BiH. This beautiful old Austrian hall will host 36 musicians from 5 countries, USA, Greece, Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia - soloists on guitar, flute, piano, violin and a countertenor, rarely heard voice at any concert! These internationally renowned artists will be joined by the members of the newly formed Sarajevo Youth Chamber Orchestra for whom this is going to be first and most significant appearance.</p>
<p>The concert will last an hour and a half and a program will be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 compositions for piano: Redemption, Andante and Toccata performed by Bartolomej Stanković, BiH.</li>
<li>3 Pieces de Cafe for guitar performed by Istvan Roemer, CRO.</li>
<li>3 compositions for guitar and flute; Levantine Journey, Đuđino Oro and Balkan Express performed by Nuclear Okra duo - Larry Hammett and Miranda Arrana, USA.</li>

Your Contribution will forever have a HUGE impact on my life and those I come across.This project has tremendous value for its authenticity and immaculate expression of self- discovery through pure sound. From performing in the opera at the age of 19 alongside famous opera singer Isola Jones. To performing in the Harbin Grand Theater in China and so on. Much success has been gained traveling abroad as a vocal artist and world musician,  I am more than ready to take my music career to another level. 

W E L C O M E   C H A L L E N G E S 
I welcome challenges with ease and grace. Putting myself far beyond out of my comfort zone with many risks at hand. Nevertheless, knowing that I have your support is what keeps me going.
